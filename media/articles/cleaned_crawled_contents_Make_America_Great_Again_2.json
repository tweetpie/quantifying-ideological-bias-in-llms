According to the report, \"Some leaders on the hard right are now beginning to worry about MAGA muddying their own brand.\" As the Economist reports, though \"Trump has had few clear wins and many chaotic policy turns ... much energy has been devoted to targeting domestic political enemies for grievances that do not resonate outside America.\"\n\nAny benefit Mr Trump might have given right-wing parties is \"being overshadowed by an expansionist and aggressive political nationalism\", says Eric Kaufmann, a professor at the University of Buckingham (and a self-described national conservative). America First, he says, \"is activating political defensiveness in other countries\". Views of America have turned sharply negative across polls in several Western countries.\n\nThis \"Trump effect\" is seen most keenly \"in countries where the American president has picked fights,\" including Ukraine and Canada,\" the report notes.\n\n\"MAGA's international allies (who describe themselves as 'national conservatives') had expected Mr Trump's victory to make radical right-wing politics more credible with voters elsewhere,\" the Economist reports. \"... But a populist Trump-bump has failed to materialise, despite efforts by many of Mr Trump's lieutenants to make his administration and the wider maga movement an inspiration to and example for right-wing populists around the world.\"\n\nAs the Economist reports, the net effect of Trump's presidency \"has been to boost mainstream incumbents at the expense of populist outsiders.\"\n\n\"Fears of trade wars and real wars tend to suck oxygen from culture wars,\" the report notes.

      "text": "'It can happen here': MAGA expert explains why Trump voters want to destroy Dept. of Education\n\n\"And one other thing I'll be doing very early in the administration is closing up the Department of Education.\"\n\nDonald Trump made this promise in a Sept. 13, 2023, campaign statement and repeated it frequently on the campaign trail .\n\nTrump tried to make this long-standing pledge a reality on March 20, 2025, by signing an executive order that he said will \"begin eliminating the federal Department of Education once and for all.\"\n\nTrump said that he hopes Democrats would support his executive order . \"I hope they're going to be voting for it,\" said Trump, speaking from the White House in front of a group of children seated at desks. \"Because ultimately it may come before them.\"\n\nProject 2025 , the conservative think tank Heritage Foundation's blueprint for the Trump administration, provides detailed recommendations for closing the Education Department , which was created by an act of Congress in 1979.\n\nThe Department of Education already announced on March 9 that it laid off more than 1,300 of its 4,100 employees .\n\nTrump's new executive order calls for Secretary of Education Linda McMahon to \" take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure (of) the Department of Education and return education authority to the States, while continuing to ensure the effective and uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which Americans rely,\" according to a White House statement distributed to media.\n\nI am an anthropologist and have been studying U.S. political culture for years. During Trump's first presidency, I wrote a book about the extremist far right called \" It Can Happen Here \". Since then, I have continued to study the Make America Great Again, or MAGA, movement , seeking to understand it, as the anthropological expression goes, \" from the native's point of view .\"\n\nEducation policies in the U.S. are largely carried out at the state and local levels. The Education Department is a relatively small government agency, which as late as February 2025 had just over 4,000 employees  and a US$268 billion annual budget . A large part of its work is overseeing $1.6 trillion in federal student loans as well as grants for K-12 schools.\n\nAnd it ensures that public schools comply with federal laws that protect vulnerable students, like those with disabilities.\n\nWhy, then, does Trump want to eliminate the department?\n\nA will to fight against so-called \"wokeness\" and a desire to shrink the government are among the four reasons I have found.\n\nFirst and foremost, Trump and his supporters believe that liberals are ruining public education by instituting what they call a \n\" radical woke agenda \" that they say prioritizes identity politics and politically correct groupthink at the expense of the free speech of those, like many conservatives, who have different views.\n\nDiversity, equity and inclusion , or DEI, initiatives promoting social justice - and critical race theory, or the idea that racism is entrenched in social and legal institutions - are a particular focus of MAGA ire.\n\nSo, too, is what Trump supporters call \" radical gender ideology ,\" which they contend promotes policies like letting transgender students play on school sports teams or use bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity, not biological sex.\n\nTrump supporters say that such policies - which the Education Department indirectly supported by expanding Title IX gender protections in 2024 to include discrimination based on gender identity - are at odds with parental school choice rights or, for some religious conservatives, the Bible.\n\nRace and gender policies are highlighted in Project 2025 and in the 2024 GOP's \"Make America Great Again!\" party platform.\n\nTrump has repeatedly promised, as he did on Aug. 14, 2024, in North Carolina, to \"keep critical race theory and transgender insanity the hell out of our schools.\"\n\nFor MAGA supporters, \" radical left \" wokeness is part of liberals' long-standing attempt to \" brainwash \" others with their allegedly Marxist views that embrace communism.\n\nOne version of this \" American Marxism \" conspiracy theory argues that the indoctrination dates to the origins of U.S. public education . MAGA stalwarts say this alleged leftist agenda is anti-democratic and anti-Christian.\n\nSaying he wants to combat the educational influence of such radicals, zealots and Marxists , Trump issued executive orders on Jan. 29 that pledge to fight \" campus anti-Semitism \" and to end \" Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schools .\"\n\nTrump supporters also argue that \"woke\" federal public education policy infringes on people's basic freedoms and rights.\n\nThis idea extends to what Trump supporters call \" restoring parental rights ,\" including the right to decide whether a child undergoes a gender transition or learns about nonbinary gender identity at public schools.\n\nThe first paragraph of Project 2025's chapter on education argues, \" Families and students should be free to choose from a diverse set of school options and learning environments.\"\n\nDiversity, according to this argument, should include faith-based institutions and homeschooling. Project 2025 proposes that the government could support parents who choose to homeschool or put their kids in a religious primary school by providing Educational Savings Accounts and school vouchers . Vouchers give public funding for students to attend private schools and have been expanding in use in recent years.\n\nCritics of school vouchers, like the National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers unions, argue that vouchers would diminish public education for vulnerable students by taking away scarce funding .\n\nTrump has already issued a Jan. 29 executive order called \" Expanding Educational Freedom and Educational Opportunity for Families ,\" which opens the door to expanded use of vouchers . This directly echoes Project 2025 by directing the Education Department to prioritize educational choice to give families a range of options.\n\nFor the MAGA faithful, the Education Department exemplifies government inefficiency and red tape.\n\nProject 2025 , for example, contends that from the time it was established by the Carter administration in 1979, the Education Department has ballooned in size, come under the sway of special interest groups and now serves as an inefficient \" one-stop shop for the woke education cartel .\"\n\nTo deal with the Education Department's \"bloat\" and \"suffocating bureaucratic red tape ,\" Project 2025 recommends shifting all of the department's federal programs and money to other agencies and the states.\n\nThese recommendations dovetail with Trump's broader attempt to eliminate what he and his MAGA supporters consider wasteful spending and deregulate the government.\n\nTrump signed an executive order on Jan. 20 that establishes a \" Department of Government Efficiency \" headed by billionaire Elon Musk. Musk said on Feb. 4 that Trump \"will succeed\" in dismantling the Education Department.\n\nTrump's executive order shuttering the Department of Education will almost certainly spark legal challenges in court.\n\nRepublican Senator Mike Rounds of South Dakota also introduced a bill in November 2024 to close the department.\n\nTrump has dismantled other government agencies in his second term, chiefly the U.S. Agency for International Development , without the required congressional approval. A federal judge ruled on March 18 that the dismantling of USAID likely violated the Constitution and ordered the Trump administration to restore all USAID employees' email and computer access.\n\nAbolishing the Department of Education would legally require congressional approval and 60 votes to move forward in the Senate , which is unlikely since Republicans only have 53 seats.\n\nRegardless of such legal challenges , Trump's March 20 executive order will further weaken the Department of Education even as it remains in the crosshairs.\n\nThis story was updated on March 20, 2025, from an earlier version published originally on Feb. 7, 2025.\n\nAlex Hinton , Distinguished Professor of Anthropology; Director, Center for the Study of Genocide and Human Rights, Rutgers University - Newark\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Sweet have warned that the Trump administration's policies are hurting America's interests.\n\nIn an op-ed titled \"America is losing trade wars\" published in The Hill on Thursday, Toth and Sweet criticized the administration for its \"self-defeating approach,\" saying it will \"not make America great again.\"\n\n\"To the contrary, if left unchecked, it could result in the partial or complete destruction of U.S. global economic and military power,\" they wrote.\n\nToth is a veteran national security commentator and Sweet served 30 years as an army intelligence officer.\n\nThe analysts said the first war the administration is losing is \"the one Russian President Vladimir Putin declared against the West when he invaded Ukraine.\"\n\n\"The second one is metaphorical - the one President Trump himself is now waging against U.S. allies,\" they wrote, referring to Trump's decision to impose sweeping tariffs on U.S. imports.\n\nCommenting on the president's handling of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, they said Putin is \"just playing Trump for time,\" adding that he is preparing a new multi-front offensive in the Donbas.\n\nOn Monday, Russia announced that \"one of the largest rounds of conscription to Russia's military for several years is underway.\"\n\n\"He made concession after concession to Russia, including partial ceasefires against energy targets in Russia and naval targets in the Black Sea - to get Putin to the negotiating table in Jeddah,\" they said of Trump.\n\n\"Yet Moscow declared Tuesday that it rejects Trump's ceasefire deal 'in its current form.'\"\n\nThe writers said Chinese President Xi Jinping was also \"taking full advantage of Team Trump's global missteps and the geopolitical vacuums they are creating across the region.\"\n\n\"To back its growing military power, Beijing announced in March it is increasing its defense budget by 7.2 percent in 2025,\" they added.\n\nThey advised the administration to reach out to key U.S. allies and \"build a combined and united response,\" noting that the administration was doing \"just the opposite of that\" by declaring April 2 as \"Liberation Day.\"\n\n\"The EU is larger as a market than the U.S. economy as a whole,\" they said, adding that European allies are turning to South Korea and France to meet their weapons requirements, accounting for 6.5 percent of NATO's European arms imports in 2024.\n\n\"Alienating your allies is a bad course of action,\" the experts said."

Image via Free Malaysia Today/Creative Commons.\n\nConservative social media influencers Angela Reitsma and Arielle Halili, who jointly host a podcast called \"Girls Gone Bible,\" are encouraging their fans to embrace President Donald Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" (MAGA) agenda, Salon noted in a piece Friday.\n\nThe article says that Reitsma and Halili, who are referred to as \"Jesus freaks,\" go on national tours and deliver what they call a \"ministry\" at ticket prices, receiving thousands of fans at packed venues.\n\nThe ticket prices begin around $40 but can be $100 or more. \"They market 'GGB+' subscriptions to their young female fanbase for $7 a month,\" the article says.\n\nAt a Trump \"victory\" rally in January, they opened the event with a prayer that equated Trump with divinity and included foreboding phrases.

The figures for 2024, which the study's researchers revealed no significant deviation from this trend, per the author.\n\nDespite concerns regarding the impact of a misogynistic online \"manosphere,\" the survey showed that the ratio of young men to young women identifying as conservative has remained relatively unchanged."

But that doesn't mean that the MAGA movement doesn't have its share of angry, bitter infighting.\n\n\"War Room\" host Steve Bannon and billionaire Tesla SpaceX Elon Musk recently clashed over H-1B visas , and there are plenty of divisions within the GOP's small House majority.\n\nIn an article published on January 8 , The Guardian's David Smith poses the question: Can President-elect Trump bring warring MAGA Republicans together?\n\nSmith explains , \"Republicans are taking full control of Washington for the first time since 2017. But the party remains an unwieldy coalition of conservatives, libertarians, moderates, populists and exhibitionists. It is already embroiled in a war or words over immigration between the tech billionaire Elon Musk and the MAGA ('Make America Great Again') grassroots.\"\n\nWhen a new Congress was sworn in on January 3, however, House Republicans-except for Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Kentucky) - put aside their differences and vote to keep Rep. Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) as their speaker. The vote followed an endorsement of Johnson from Trump.\n\nElaine Kamarck of the Brookings Institution told The Guardian that the MAGA coalition has \"got some pretty deep fissures in it.\"\n\nKamarck added, however , \"On the other hand, Trump is, at this moment, popular enough to probably soothe over some of those fissures as he did in the intervention that got Speaker Johnson over the top. He came in at the last minute and saved the day, and so, I expect that initially, he's going to be quite powerful in directing the party.\"\n\nRead The Guardian's full article at this link ."

      "text": "Stuck in the past: How Trump's policies are dragging the U.S. back to the 19th century\n\nDuring Donald Trump's first term as president, the United States lurched from the absurdity of his lies to the use of his office for personal financial gain , his schoolyard insults and his utter contempt for critics . His term ended with his irresponsible and dangerous incitement of the assault on the Capitol building on Jan. 6, 2021 .\n\nThis time around, Trump is relying on outdated tools - tariffs, small government, territorial expansion and nationalism - to solve modern problems of globalization, wealth disparities, the decline of manufacturing jobs and exploitative capitalism.\n\nOn April 2, he announced a baseline tariff of 10 per cent on all imports that aren't compliant with the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement. Canada has also been hit with a 25 per cent levy on Canadian-made automobiles.\n\nThe Trump administration's current use of 19th-century tools to solve 20th-century problems that are wholly inappropriate for the 21st century threatens to take America back to the 19th century. This is an incredibly dangerous road for the U.S to take.\n\nThe 19th century was marked by the rise of the nation-state - a single political entity united by geography, culture and language.\n\nThis was, in many respects, the result of the rapidly industrializing world shifting away from monarchical rule and mercantile economics toward limited democratic rule and free-market capitalism .\n\nIt was a time of tariffs, small government, territorial expansion and nationalism. It was also a time of mass migration from Europe to North America, where rampant nativism , colonialism and unchecked and exploitative capitalism shaped the landscape.\n\nThe prevailing belief at the time was that nation-states should use tariffs , adopt isolationist policies to cut off the outside world and seize territory where possible. These measures, it was thought, would foster national unity and allow capitalism to thrive by letting the \"invisible hand\" of the marketplace work its magic.\n\nProtective tariffs promised to grow domestic industries, but the economic benefits were not evenly distributed. Wealth disparities grew wider as millions of immigrants arrived on North American shores, only to find deplorable living conditions in the cities and hardscrabble farmland out in the country.\n\nSome newcomers prospered, of course, but they tended to be those who arrived with money already in their pockets. And they fast learned how to exploit the lack of state-directed regulation, patches of corruption amid rapid western expansion and growing nativism and poverty to their own benefit .\n\nMany of the 20th century's problems flowed from these 19th-century trends.\n\nFollowing the financial Panic of 1873 and its ensuing economic depression in both Europe and North America, nation-states unleashed tariffs to protect their domestic economies. It was the wrong strategy to pursue, as it slowed trade even more by limiting the free flow of goods and capital. Money, as is now well-known, needs to move to grow.\n\nWorking families chafed at the lack of labour protections like bargaining rights, health and safety measures, unemployment insurance and sick benefits. In response, they formed unions and initiated waves of strikes throughout the western industrialized world .\n\nWestern North American farmers were furious that tariffs forced them to buy on protected markets while selling on unprotected ones subject to international market prices. They organized, too, by forming farmer co-operatives and backing movements like the Granger movement , populism and progressivism to protect their interests.\n\nNation-states, warmed by rising nationalist fires, formed military-defence alliances across Europe and its colonial and former colonial holdings, including Canada. In 1914, these alliances led to the First World War , a global and industrial war the likes of which the world had never seen.\n\nBy the 1930s, unrestricted and largely unregulated capitalism, together with astonishing wealth disparities and monopolistic tendencies, plunged the world into the decade-long Great Depression .\n\nMany governments' initial response was to impose tariffs once again, and just as in 1873, they only made the problem worse. The simultaneous rise of fascism, which was largely nationalism run amok, brought the world to war again at the end of the decade, to devastating consequence.\n\nThe post-war years saw a concerted international effort at using the nation-state to regulate domestic economies by investing in social services and programs and to rein in runaway capital when its excesses threatened stability.\n\nInternational bodies like the World Bank, the United Nations and the International Court of Justice were created to promote peace and stability. This new approach wasn't always successful in its goals, but so far the world hasn't seen any global hot wars or massive economic depressions.\n\nIn 1992, historian Frances Fukuyama infamously declared that the world had reached \"the end of history.\"\n\nHe didn't mean that time stopped, of course. Instead, he was arguing that the liberal nation-state represented \"the end-point of mankind's ideological evolution and the universalization of western liberal democracy as the final form of human government.\"\n\nIn his view, the western industrialized world had reached the pinnacle of successful governance and unlimited prosperity.\n\nYet, even as western liberal democracy was congratulating itself on its own success, these same nation-states, in conjunction with large corporations, were seeking out lower labour costs and greater profit in the developing world.\n\nThe result was a hollowing-out of North America's industrial heartlands , along with rampant exploitation of vulnerable labour in places like Asia, South Asia and South Central America . Once mighty American cities declined . Wages failed to keep up with inflation . Farm debt soared.\n\nThis is where the Trump administration re-enters the story - tapping into the frustration and disillusionment of frustrated Americans by promising to restore a \" golden age \" that never was .\n\nDespite his promises , Trump's tariffs are unlikely to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. As history has shown, tariffs do not revive industries that are already gone; instead, they will only make Americans pay more for the things they need.\n\nA return to small government won't \"make America great again,\" either. Instead, it risks repeating the 19th-century pattern of making the rich richer and gutting the very social programs millions of people rely on. The Trump administration's massive and ongoing cuts to the Social Security Administration are already well under way.\n\nTrump's rhetoric about territorial expansion, including threats to annex Greenland and Canada , won't make the U.S. more secure. It will just exacerbate the sort of international tensions the world saw in 1914 and 1939.\n\nAnd with limited resources left to exploit, it's becoming harder for capital to sustain itself, even as it seeks to wrest whatever is left from our planet, the realities of environmental catastrophe be damned.\n\nNationalism, meanwhile, won't foster a sense of national unity. It will only deepen existing divisions based on race and class. And if history is any guide, the consequences could be even more dire this time around, even pushing the world toward a global conflict unlike anything seen before.\n\nEric Strikwerda , Associate Professor, History, Athabasca University\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

      "text": "Trump's interior life is a clown car of neurotic conflicts -so we must all suffer\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk sit in a Tesla car model S, in front of the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., March 11, 2025.\n\nA senior consultant in Saul Alinsky's Industrial Areas Foundation used to teach progressive leaders that there is a necessary difference between the values and functions of public vs. private relationships. In private life, relationships are ends in themselves. For public actors, relationships are appropriately more instrumental and transactional. Self-sacrifice is normal in personal relationships, while self-interest guides public action. For political leaders, personal gratification should take a backseat to public service. Of course, there is often a blurring of these boundaries, but, in general, when these domains overlap too much, the consequences are usually disastrous. We see in Donald Trump an extreme example of what happens when someone in public is unable to have any guard rails between the pressures of his or her private psychology and public actions.\n\nIn Donald Trump's world, the political is always personal. Barriers between the two worlds, the sort of censorship and self-restraint that effective leaders are obligated to exercise in public life, have completely collapsed. Instead, Trump's policies are suffused with his personal and private needs, defenses, and insecurities. His tariff policies seek to punish Canada for being \"nasty\" and resistant to his bizarre agenda of making Canada our 51 st state. He wants to hobble Ukraine because Zelensky was disrespectful to him. With Musk's help, he spins and distorts reality in order to punish the \"deep state\" that he feels sought to undermine him. He notoriously goes to extreme lengths to try to punish his prior and current political enemies, targeting lawyers and journalists and threatening to 'primary' disloyal legislators. His ignorance about policy reflects the fact that he recklessly acts on private impulses and not thoughtful reflection. He lies compulsively and continually, and always in the service of bombastic claims of perfection and self-exoneration. He frees criminals and criminalizes dissent, not out of high-minded principles and commitment to the public interest but out of base impulses involving his personal narcissistic needs and vulnerabilities.\n\nObviously, public figures and leaders are human beings with personal psychologies that invariably influence their public political actions. Effective leaders, however, learn to subordinate or at least sublimate personal psychological conflicts in the interests of being politically strategic, negotiating compromises, and focusing on desirable political outcomes that serve a broader good. No one is saying that politicians leave their egos at the door, but, instead, the best ones seek to restrain these egos in order to achieve their political goals.\n\nTrump is the opposite. He acts (out) entirely on the basis of personal animus and internal conflicts and then, only retroactively, spins a tale that paints his words and actions as principled or visionary. He will act on a small-minded personal impulse like humiliating Zelensky in the Oval Office, but then argue that what was clearly an idiosyncratic personal response was really part of his efforts to single-handedly solve the Ukraine/Russian war and ensure world peace. He feels slighted by other world leaders and trash talks them in public, implying that his derogatory language and claims are really part of his efforts to make America great again and to promote a high minded \"America First\" agenda without a hint of awareness that the real psychic motivation behind his actions involve making Trump \"great\" and \"first.\"\n\nThe characteristics that drive Trump to constantly leak his personal issues into his public political postures, the real reasons he simply cannot keep the seamier sides of his personality from flooding his actions as President, all stem from the precise nature of his psychological makeup. Trump's psychology is hiding in plain sight. He is driven to avoid or refute any situation, any moment, in which he might potentially feel or be seen as at a disadvantage, inadequate, inferior, or otherwise a failure. He lives in dire fear of such feelings and instinctively, automatically, and desperately has to go out of his way to communicate the opposite. We don't have to be Freud to know this. We see it every day in Trump's constant clownish boasting and self-aggrandizing arrogance.\n\nEveryone is so used to Trump's compulsive sense of grievance and defensive arrogance that it no longer seems to be the impairment that it actually is. No one blinks an eye when he makes remarks, barely concealed within his word salad, about \"having the best words,\" being \"the best President for black people since Abraham Lincoln,\" or knowing more about taxes, the military, climate change-well, pretty much everything-than the world's experts. Even when the conservative Murdoch-owned Wall Street Journal had the temerity to remark that the positive business sentiment seen months before the election had shifted in response to Trump's tariffs, Trump couldn't tolerate the implied criticism and fired back with this tweet: \"The Globalist Wall Street Journal has no idea what they are doing or saying,\" he declared . \"They are owned by the polluted thinking of the European Union, which was formed for the primary purpose of 'screwing the United States of America. Their (WSJ!) thinking is antiquated and weak, and very bad for the USA. But have no fear, we will WIN on everything!!!\"\n\nMy point here is that Trump has no choice, no freedom at all, to edit or censor remarks like these because the psychic threats they seek to mitigate-feelings of shame, inferiority and/or failure-are so threatening to him that they leave him no room at all to be cautious, modest, or to seek common ground. While all politicians, like all people, bring their personal psychologies into their public work lives, Trump's interior life is a clown car of neurotic conflicts that have seized control of his executive functions and shape his every public statement and action. Unfortunately the fact that these conflicts are playing out publicly in the head of the most powerful person in the world threatens economic and political stability worldwide. WE can only hope that there are still some adults in the room that can restrain him."

      "text": "Could stupidity and cowardice save America in the end?\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump hosts his first cabinet meeting at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., February 26, 2025.\n\nDonald Trump's first Cabinet meeting was amateur hour at its finest.\n\nElon Musk, the blundering billionaire who admitted at the meeting that he and DOGE \"accidentally\" fired the Ebola team at the Department of Health and Human Services, led the discussion, while Trump backed Musk on his threat to federal workers, telling them they'll be fired unless they reply to the email Musk sent asking what they'd accomplished in the week prior.\n\nTrump noted one million federal workers hadn't responded and that maybe they \"don't exist.\"\n\nMusk then said he'd give them one more chance. Of course, the reason a good deal of them might not have responded is because the heads of agencies- the Cabinet officials in the room-as well as the Trump administration itself , had told employees that they didn't need to respond, that it was all \"voluntary.\"\n\nThis was the latest example of the conflict and power struggle inside the White House, where \"the Trump administration\" has a different position than Donald Trump himself, and where Cabinet officials in the room were caught off guard , pitted against Musk. Trump and Musk were sending a warning to them to listen to Musk-and no one else-and every one of them stayed silent, complete cowards.\n\nIt was breathtakingly embarrassing and exposed so much about what's going on as more comes out about the disarray and sheer stupidity. Meanwhile, reports about the economy stressing under tariffs, spending freezes and mass firings are emerging -while Trump seems oblivious to it-as is the fear expressed by some economists that we are headed for a deep Trump recession. And that will affect millions of people, no matter their political party.\n\nThen there are the thousands of Trump supporters, federal workers who found themselves out of a job, making their lives worse even as they supposedly voted to Make America Great Again. They all have families, friends, neighbors and others who voted for Trump and who will be impacted or see what's happening. The mass firings by the government will affect so many other industries and cause more layoffs as well as a pullback in spending.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times focused in some of the fired MAGA :\n\nGeorgia resident Jocelyn Steward, according to her Facebook page, was excited about her new job as a health insurance specialist with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. She voted for Trump for three straight elections. She believed job cuts \"would focus on early retirements and workers who underperformed.\"\n\nBut she was duped-and dumped.\n\n\"Layoffs aren't easy on anybody. But there has been zero compassion for anything or anyone in this process,\" Steward, a Georgia resident, told the LA Times. \"A lot of these federal workers are doing good work. Please just show a little empathy.\"\n\nNow she seems really angry, days after she was fired and after giving the interview, posting on her Facebook page about the letter from Elon Musk to federal workers:\n\nTwenty-four-year-old Ryleigh Cooper of Baldwin, Michigan, voted for Joe Biden in 2020. According to the Washington Post article in which she's interviewed: \"She did not want to vote for Trump. Cooper hated what he said about women and hated how he treated them...But life felt more complicated these days...\"\n\nStruggling to have children, she was told IVF would be her only hope. Unable to pay the exorbitant costs, this young and clearly naïve woman actually believed Trump when he said his administration would pay for IVF.\n\nBut instead of getting IVF, she lost her job at the U.S. Forest Service, axed by DOGE, completely devastating her.\n\nFour days after Trump fired her, Cooper was in bed with her husband and an alert came on her phone:\n\nI know there's zero sympathy for these people who stupidly-and selfishly-made their own beds. But again, they are representative of the people-many of the Republicans and independents-showing up at town halls and angrily expressing themselves to GOP lawmakers. Many of them and their families and friends will add to Trump's and the GOP's downfall and help Democrats in upcoming elections.\n\nSo too will the cowards running institutions that are obeying in advance and cutting medical care or ending classes, all based on Trump's \"DEI\" executive orders, even though in many cases it's quite a stretch and not even remotely necessary. And no law has been passed; they're executive orders and they're actually being challenged and, in some cases, have already been put on hold in court.\n\nThe latest outrageous example of spinelessness is the Art Museum of the Americas in Washington canceling shows by Black and LGBTQ artists , saying they must adhere to the DEI orders because a portion of their funding comes from the U.S. government. This is flat out censorship:\n\nIt's a ridiculous and dangerous action, because there's nothing about DEI connected to the mounting of these exhibits. They are simply exhibits about and by Black and queer artists. They're not being shown for any reasons of \"inclusion\" or \"diversity\" but because they're really interesting and reflect vitally important aspects of history, in addition to speaking to big audiences that want to see them.\n\nThere was no reason to cancel these shows. But DEI has simply been interpreted to mean anything not White, heterosexual or male, and so the museum's director canceled the shows even though the U.S. is just one of 30 countries that contribute to its work.\n\nArtists around the country and worldwide are furious, and this is just one example of institutions obeying in advance and waking people up.\n\nThere's no question Democrats have to amplify everything Trump is doing and push back hard. But they also need to exploit the outrage of the American people.\n\nAnd the anger is building across the country and across the political spectrum among diverse groups, even among some people who voted for Trump. All of it is a welcome contribution to opponents working to take down Trump and the GOP.\n\nNOW READ: How Trump and the GOP have already fixed the 2026 election"

Scott Applewhite)\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks during a news conference with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the East Room of the White House, Tuesday, Feb. 4, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - President Donald Trump is testing how far Republicans are willing to go in supporting his supercharged \"Make America Great Again\" agenda, tearing down government agencies and taking actions fundamentally at odds with once-traditional party principles.\n\nFor now, Republicans are marching largely in lockstep. They are backing Cabinet nominees with troubling histories, turning a blind eye as he halts spending they appropriated and defending policies once anathema to mainstream GOP thinking - policies that would have drawn alarm if Democrats had been responsible.\n\n\"They're pushing the envelope of what their power looks like. It's a normal part of a transition,\" said Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C.\n\nWhile there have been isolated voices of dissent, the Republican resistance that emerged when Trump first ran for office has largely been sidelined. That means the president, backed by Republican majorities in the House and Senate, is proceeding largely unchecked as he reimagines the federal government and greatly expands the power of the presidency.\n\n\"If there was any doubt about it, the Republican Party's complete acquiescence to Donald Trump, I think, was on full display this week,\" said Charlie Sykes, a longtime conservative commentator turned prominent Trump critic. Sykes described it as \"complete surrender.\"\n\nIn his view, \"Republicans have just made the calculation that pretty much nothing is worth antagonizing Trump at this point.\"\n\nThe defense has come as Trump has embraced a series of proposals that go far beyond anything he did during his first term or promised on the campaign trail.\n\nLast week, he threatened trade wars with Mexico and Canada, two of America's top trading partners and closest allies. His tariffs are on hold for 30 days , but he has damaged the U.S. relationship with Canada, one of the nations with which the U.S. shares its most sensitive intelligence.\n\nOn Tuesday, he suggested the U.S. seize control of Gaza , perhaps by force. He campaigned for the White House promising to end \"forever wars\" and the U.S. entanglement in the Middle East.\n\nHe has proposed taking over Greenland, riffed on Canada becoming the 51st state and threatened to put the Panama Canal back under American control. He is pursuing state ownership of social media companies such as TikTok, perhaps through a government-owned U.S. sovereign wealth fund. That kind of intervention, if coming from Democrats, would almost certainly have been branded as a socialist move.\n\nAfter years of railing against unelected bureaucrats, Republicans are standing by as billionaire Elon Musk and his aides aim for the equivalent of a hostile takeover of government. That Trump-authorized team has seized taxpayer data , gained access to sensitive databases and government payment systems, and taken steps to close the U.S. Agency for International Development , which many Republicans long criticized but also saw as part of the U.S. efforts to counter China and Russia abroad.\n\n\"The American people said we want a different direction,\" said Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., when asked about the moves against USAID and other agencies. \"I don't find that outside the spirit of our system, and the courts will have to decide whether it's outside the literal boundaries of the president's authority.\"\n\nAs for the trade taxes, he added, \"Most Republicans aren't tariff fans, but they do understand why populism is the flavor of the day.\"\n\n′′A lot of people, they talk about Trump loyalty like there's something wrong with a president that wants loyalty. And quite honestly, I would submit that loyalty is a pretty big and pretty important part of running a country,\" he added.\n\nPolling has shown voters have grown more opposed to expanding tariffs over the past four years. About half of voters (49%) in the November election favored increasing taxes on goods imported to the United States from other countries, compared with 6 in 10 voters in the 2020 presidential election who supported higher tariffs. Republican voters still largely favor the policy.\n\nThere's also a shift against American intervention. Only about 2 in 10 (19%) voters in November said they wanted the U.S. to take a \"more active\" role in solving the world's problems. Republican voters, in particular, have shifted toward advocating a \"less active\" role. About half (53%) wanted the U.S. less involved, compared with about one-third in 2020.\n\nEven Trump's most controversial nominees appear to be sailing through.\n\nThis week, Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., a doctor who leads the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, voted to advance the nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as health secretary despite Kennedy's long history of anti-vaccine activism. Cassidy is up for reelection next year and has faced pressure from home-state Republicans to back Kennedy. Cassidy has made clear he had serious concerns about Kennedy's record.\n\n\"Unlike the fractured and chaotic Democrat Party, the Republican Party stands strong, united and thriving,\" White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said. \"There is nothing to resist -- President Trump received a clear and overwhelming mandate from the American people to Make America Great Again.\"\n\nThere has been some limited pushback from key allies.\n\nSen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said Trump should reconsider stripping security protection from former government officials who are under threat from Iran due to their involvement in the strike on Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani in January 2020.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham , R-S.C., criticized Trump for pardoning Jan. 6 rioters who had been convicted of attacking police, and he said Trump's proposal for a U.S. takeover of Gaza was \"problematic.\"\n\n\"The idea of Americans going in on the ground in Gaza is a nonstarter for every senator,\" Graham told reporters Wednesday.\n\nOn the tariffs, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, pleaded with Trump for an exemption for potash used in fertilizers to spare Iowa family farmers.\n\nAnd Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has been especially outspoken.\n\nOtherwise, Republican senators this week have played down the potential negative impact of Trump's actions and stressed the importance of uniting behind him.\n\n\"I hope my colleagues will be supportive of him when it comes to his tariffs,\" said Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., warning of potential \"danger\" if foreign countries see Trump facing political backlash from members of Congress or state lawmakers.\n\nDemocrats are scrambling to curtail Trump's power grabs and are appealing to Republicans to join their cause.\n\nSen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., said Democrats are mounting an \"all hands on deck approach\" to fighting Trump's executive orders and they are contesting Musk's access to sensitive payment systems at the Treasury Department. She wants GOP colleagues to help push back.\n\n\"In the Congress we have to stand up and speak out,\" she said. \"And if it's only the Democrats doing that, we have a problem because the Republicans have the majority in both the House and the Senate. Some of them have got to stand with us and call this out.\"\n\nBut Republicans deny that Trump is overstepping and say his team is within its authority to \"pause\" programs. The Constitution, in Article 1, gives Congress the power to collect taxes, pay debts and provide for the defense and general welfare of the country.\n\n\"We don't see this as a threat to Article 1 at all,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said. \"We see this as an active, engaged, committed executive branch authority doing what the executive branch should do.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Stephen Groves, Lisa Mascaro and Linley Sanders in Washington and Scott Bauer in Madison, Wis., contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Jeff Landry announced Friday.\n\n\"Today, under President Trump, begins a renaissance in this Nation,\" Landry said in a written statement. \"One where America and her people will always come first. In Louisiana, we think that is worthy of celebrating!\"\n\nThe staunch Trump ally invited fellow Louisianans to raise MAGA flags on Inauguration Day. Landry had previously ordered flags on state buildings set at half-staff in honor of the 14 people killed in a New Year's terror attack in New Orleans .\n\nTrump's inauguration fell on the day of mourning Landry initially set aside for British national Edward Pettifer , the stepson of Prince William's former nanny. A Landry spokesperson told The Associated Press that state flags would now be lowered for Pettifer on Jan. 24.\n\nEarlier this week, House Speaker Mike Johnson ordered flags at the U.S. Capitol to be raised to full height on Inauguration Day, interrupting a 30-day flag-lowering order after the death of former President Jimmy Carter last month. The flags will be lowered again the following day.\n\nNorth Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong , Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey, Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, Iowa Gov.

Greg Abbott have all proclaimed that they will fully raise U.S. flags in their states for the inauguration.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's Dec. 29 flag-lowering order affects federal government buildings and their grounds as well as U.S. embassies and other facilities abroad and runs through Jan. 28, Trump's first week in office.\n\nThe incoming president has complained about flags flying low as he assumes office.\n\n\"Democrats are all 'giddy'\" about the notion that flags will be lowered on Inauguration Day, Trump wrote Jan. 3 on social media.\n\n\"Nobody wants to see this,\" Trump wrote. He added that \"no American can be happy about it. Let's see how it plays out. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"\n\nTrump has already taken to flying U.S. flags at full height from his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

All Rights Reserved.\n\nPresident Donald Trump vowed to keep up his campaign of \"swift and unrelenting action\" in reorienting the nation's economy, immigration and foreign policy as he delivered an unyielding address Tuesday night to Congress and the nation.\n\nPresident Donald Trump addresses a joint session of Congress at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, March 4, 2025. (Win McNamee/Pool Photo via AP)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - A transcript of President Donald Trump's speech to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday, March 4, 2025, as transcribed by The Associated Press:\n\nPresident Donald Trump addresses a joint session of Congress at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, March 4, 2025. (Win McNamee/Pool Photo via AP)\n\nSpeaker Johnson, Vice President Vance, the first lady of the United States, members of the United States Congress, thank you very much and to my fellow citizens: America is back. Six weeks ago, I stood beneath the dome of this Capitol and proclaimed the dawn of the Golden Age of America. From that moment on, it has been nothing but swift and unrelenting action to usher in the greatest and most successful era in the history of our country. We have accomplished more in 43 days than most administrations accomplished in 4 years, 8 years - and we are just getting started. I return to this chamber tonight to report that America's momentum is back. Our spirit is back. Our pride is back. Our confidence is back. And the American Dream is surging bigger and better than ever before.\n\nThe American Dream is unstoppable, and our country is on the verge of a comeback the likes of which the world has never witnessed, and perhaps will never witness again. Never been anything like it. The presidential election of November 5th was a mandate like has not been seen in many decades. We won all seven swing states, giving us an Electoral College victory of 312 votes. We won the popular vote by big numbers and won counties in our country 2,700 to 525 on a map that reads almost completely red for Republican.\n\nNow, for the first time in modern history, more Americans believe that our country is headed in the right direction than the wrong direction - in fact it's an astonishing record, 27-point swing - the most ever. Likewise, small business optimism saw its single largest one-month gain ever recorded, a 41-point jump. Over the past six weeks, I have signed nearly 100 Executive Orders and taken more than 400 Executive Actions, a record to restore common sense, safety, optimism and wealth all across our wonderful land. The people elected me to do the job, and I am doing it. In fact, it has been stated by many that the first month of our presidency, it's our presidency, is the most successful in the history of our nation. By many.\n\nAnd what makes it even more impressive, is that you know who number two is? George Washington. How about that? I don't know about that list but we'll take it. Within hours of taking the oath of office, I declared a national emergency on our southern border, and I deployed the U.S. military and Border Patrol to repel the invasion of our country, and what a job they've done. As a result, illegal border crossings last month were by far the lowest ever recorded, ever. They heard my words and they chose not to come. Much easier that way.\n\nIn comparison, under Joe Biden, the worst president in American history, there were hundreds of thousands of illegal crossings a month, and virtually all of them, including murderers, drug dealers, gang members and people from mental institutions and insane asylums, were released into our country. Who would want to do that?\n\nThis is my fifth such speech to Congress, and once again, I look at the Democrats in front of me, and I realize there is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy or to make them stand or smile or applaud, nothing I can do. I could find a cure to the most devastating disease, a disease that would wipe out entire nations, or announce the answers to the greatest economy in history or the stoppage of crime to the lowest levels ever recorded, and these people sitting right here will not clap, will not stand and certainly will not cheer for these astronomical achievements. They won't do it no matter what, five, five times I've been up here. It's very sad, and it just shouldn't be this way.\n\nSo, Democrats sitting before me, for just this one night, why not join us in celebrating so many incredible wins for America, for the good of our nation? Let's work together and let's truly make America great again. Every day my administration is fighting to deliver the change America needs to bring a future America deserves and we're doing it. This is a time for big dreams and bold action.\n\nUpon taking office, I imposed an immediate freeze on all federal hiring, a freeze on all new federal regulations, and a freeze on all foreign aid. I terminated the ridiculous green new scam. I withdrew from the unfair Paris Climate Accord, which was costing us trillions of dollars that other countries were not paying. I withdrew from the corrupt World Health Organization, and I also withdrew from the anti-American U.N. Human Rights Council. We ended all of Biden's environmental restrictions that were making our country far less safe and totally unaffordable. And importantly, we ended the last administration's insane electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto workers and companies from economic destruction. To unshackle our economy, I have directed that for every one new regulation, 10 old regulations must be eliminated, just like I did in my very successful first term. And in that first term, we set records on ending unnecessary rules and regulations like no other president had done before.\n\nWe ordered all federal workers to return to the office. They will either show up for work in person or be removed from their job. We have ended weaponized government, where, as an example, a sitting president is allowed to viciously prosecute his political opponent like me. How did that work out? Not too good, not too good. And I have stopped all government censorship and brought back free speech in America, it's back. And two days ago I signed an order making English the official language of the United States of America.\n\nI renamed the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America. And likewise, I renamed for a great president, William McKinley, Mount McKinley, again. Beautiful Alaska. We love Alaska. We've ended the tyranny of so-called Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies all across the entire federal government and indeed the private sector and our military. And our country will be woke no longer.\n\nWe believe that whether you are a doctor, an accountant, a lawyer or an air traffic controller, you should be hired and promoted based on skill and competence, not race or gender. You should be hired based on merit, and the Supreme Court in a brave and very powerful decision has allowed us to do so. Thank you, thank you very much. We have removed the poison of critical race theory from our public schools and I signed an order making the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female.\n\nI also signed an executive order to ban men from playing in women's sports. Three years ago, Payton McNabb was an all-star high school athlete, one of the best, preparing for a future in college sports. But when her girls volleyball match was invaded by a male, he smashed the ball so hard in Payton's face, causing traumatic brain injury, partially paralyzing her right side and ending her athletic career. It was a shot like she's never seen before. She's never seen anything like it. Payton is here tonight in the gallery, and Payton, from now on, schools will kick the men off the girls team or they will lose all federal funding.\n\nAnd if you really want to see numbers, just take a look at what happened in the women's boxing, weightlifting, track and field, swimming or cycling, where a male recently finished a long-distance race five hours and 14 minutes ahead of a woman for a new record by five hours. Broke the record by five hours. It's demeaning for women, and it's very bad for our country. We're not going to put up with it any longer.\n\nWhat I have just described is only a small fraction of the common sense revolution that is now because of us sweeping the entire world, common sense has become a common theme, and we will never go back. Never, never going to let that happen. Among my very highest priorities is to rescue our economy and get dramatic and immediate relief to working families. As you know, we inherited from the last administration an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare. Their policies drove up energy prices, pushed up grocery costs, and drove the necessities of life out of reach for millions and millions of Americans, they've never had anything like it. We suffered the worst inflation in 48 years, but perhaps even in the history of our country, they're not sure. As president, I'm fighting every day to reverse this damage and make America affordable again.\n\nJoe Biden especially let the price of eggs get out of control. The egg prices out of control. And we are working hard to get it back down. Secretary, do a good job on that, you inherited a total mess from that administration. Do a good job. A major focus of our fight to defeat inflation is rapidly reducing the cost of energy. The previous administration cut the number of new oil and gas leases by 95%, slowed pipeline construction to a halt, and closed more than 100 power plants. We are opening up many of those power plants right now. And frankly, we have never seen anything like it.\n\nThat's why, on my first day in office, I declared a national energy emergency. As you've heard me say many times, we have more liquid gold under our feet than any nation on Earth. And by far, and now, I fully authorize the most talented team ever assembled to go and get it. It's called drill, baby, drill.\n\nMy administration is also working on a gigantic natural gas pipeline in Alaska, among the largest in the world, where Japan, South Korea and other nations want to be our partner with investments of trillions of dollars each. It's never been anything like that one. It will be truly spectacular. It's all set to go. The permitting has gotten and later this week, I will also take historic action to dramatically expand production of critical minerals and rare earths here in the USA.\n\nTo further combat inflation, we will not only be reducing the cost of energy, but will be ending the flagrant waste of taxpayer dollars.\n\nAnd to that end I have created the brand new Department of Government Efficiency. DOGE! Perhaps you've heard of it, perhaps. Which is headed by Elon Musk, who is in the gallery tonight. Thank you, Elon, you're working very hard. He didn't need this, he didn't need this. Thank you very much. We appreciate it. Everybody here, even this side, appreciates it I believe. They just don't want to admit that.\n\nJust listen to some of the appalling waste we have already identified: $22 billion from HHS to provide free housing and cars for illegal aliens, $45 million for diversity, equity and inclusion scholarships in Burma, $40 million to improve the social and economic inclusion of sedentary migrants. Nobody knows what that is. $8 million to promote LGBTQ+ in the African nation of Lesotho, which nobody has ever heard of, $60 million for indigenous peoples and Afro-Colombian empowerment in Central America. $60 million. $8 million for making mice transgender.\n\nThis is real. $32 million for a left-wing propaganda operation in Moldova. $10 million for male circumcision in Mozambique. $20 million for the Arab \"Sesame Street\" in the Middle East, it's a program, $20 million for program. $1.9 billion to recently created decarbonization of homes committee - headed up and we know she's involved just at the last moment, the money was passed over by a woman named Stacey Abrams. Have you ever heard of her? A $3.5 million consulting contract for lavish fish monitoring. $1.5 million for voter confidence in Liberia, $14 million for social cohesion in Mali, $59 million for illegal alien hotel rooms in New York City, real estate developers done very well. $250,000 to increase vegan local climate action innovation in Zambia, $42 million for social and behavior change in Uganda, $14 million for improving public procurement in Serbia, $47 million for improving learning outcomes in Asia. Asia is doing very well with learning. You know what we're doing? Should use it ourselves. A $101 million for DEI contracts at the Department of Education. The most ever paid, nothing even like it. Under the Trump administration, all of these scams and there are far worse, but I didn't think it was appropriate to talk about them, they're so bad. Many more have been found out and exposed and swiftly terminated by a group of very intelligent, mostly young people headed up by Elon, and we appreciate it. We found hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud.\n\nAnd we've taken back the money and reduced our debt to fight inflation and other things. Taking back a lot of that money, we got it just in time. This is just the beginning. The Government Accountability Office, federal government office, has estimated annual fraud of over $500 billion in our nation, and we are working very hard to stop it. We're going to. We're also identifying shocking levels of incompetence and probable fraud in the Social Security program for our seniors and that our seniors and people that we love rely on.\n\nBelieve it or not, government databases list 4.7 million Social Security members from people aged 100 to 109 years old. It lists 3.6 million people from ages 110 to 119. I don't know any of them. I know some people that are rather elderly, but not quite that elderly. 3.47 million people from ages 120 to 129, 3.9 million people from ages 130 to 139, 3.5 million people from ages 140 to 149, and money is being paid to many of them, and we're searching right now. In fact, Pam, good luck, good luck. You're going to find it. But a lot of money is paid out to people, because it just keeps getting paid and paid, and nobody does, and it really hurts Social Security and hurts our country, 1.3 million people from ages 150 to 159 and over 130,000 people, according to the Social Security databases, are age over 160 years old. We have a healthier country than I thought, Bobby.\n\nIncluding, to finish, 1,039 people between the ages of 220 and 229, one person between the age of 240 and 249 and one person is listed at 360 years of age - more than 100 years, more than 100 years older than our country. But we're going to find out where that money is going, and it's not going to be pretty, by slashing all of the fraud, waste and theft. And theft we can find. We will defeat inflation, bring down mortgage rates, lower car payments and grocery prices, protect our seniors and put more money in the pockets of American families.\n\nAnd today, interest rates took a beautiful drop. Big beautiful drop. It's about time. And in the near future I want to do what has not been done in 24 years - balance the federal budget, we're gonna balance it.\n\nWith that goal in mind, we have developed in great detail what we are calling the Gold Card, which goes on sale very, very soon. For $5 million we will allow the most successful job-creating people from all over the world to buy a path to U.S. citizenship. It's like the green card, but better and more sophisticated. And these people will have to pay tax in our country. They won't have to pay tax from where they came, the money that they've made, you wouldn't want to do that. But they have to pay tax, create jobs. They'll also be taking people out of colleges and paying for them so that we can keep them in our country, instead of having them being forced out. Number one at the top school as an example, being forced out and not being allowed to stay and create tremendous numbers of jobs and great success for a company out there.\n\nSo while we take out the criminals, killers, traffickers and child predators who are allowed to enter our country under the open border policy of these people, the Democrats, the Biden administration, the open border, insane policies that you've allowed to destroy our country, we will now bring in brilliant, hardworking job-creating people. They're going to pay a lot of money, and we're going to reduce our debt with that money.\n\nAmericans have given us a mandate for bold and profound change. For nearly 100 years the federal bureaucracy has grown until it has crushed our freedoms, ballooned our deficits, and held back America's potential in every possible way. The nation founded by pioneers and risk takers, now drowns under millions and millions of pages of regulations and debt. Approvals that should take 10 days to get instead, take 10 years, 15 years, and even 20 years before you reject it. Meanwhile, we have hundreds of thousands of federal workers who have not been showing up to work. My administration will reclaim power from this unaccountable bureaucracy, and we will restore true democracy to America again. Any federal bureaucrat who resists this change will be removed from office immediately.\n\nBecause we are draining the swamp, it's very simple, and the days of rule by unelected bureaucrats are over. And the next phase of our plan to deliver the greatest economy in history is for this Congress to pass tax cuts for everybody. They're in there, they're waiting for you to vote. And I'm sure that the people on my right - I don't mean the Republican right, but my right, right here - I'm sure you're going to vote for those tax cuts, because otherwise I don't believe the people will ever vote you into office. So I'm doing you a big favor by telling you that. But I know this group is going to be voting for the tax cut. A very, very big part of our plan, we had tremendous success in our first term with it, a very big part of our plan. We're seeking permanent income tax cuts all across the board and to get urgently needed relief to Americans hit especially hard by inflation. I'm calling for no tax on tips, no tax overtime and no tax on Social Security benefits for our great seniors.\n\nAnd I also want to make interest payments on car loans tax deductible, but only if the car is made in America. Oh, and by the way, we're going to have growth in the auto industry like nobody's ever seen. Plants are opening up all over the place. Deals are being made like never seen. That's a combination of the election win and tariffs. It's a beautiful word, isn't it? That that along with our other policies will allow our auto industry to absolutely boom. It's going to boom. Spoke to the majors today. All three, the top people and they're so excited. In fact, already numerous car companies have announced that they will be building massive automobile plants in America, with Honda just announcing a new plant in Indiana, one of the largest anywhere in the world. And this has taken place since a great victory on November 5th, a date which will hopefully go down as one of the most important in the history of our country. In addition, as part of our tax cuts, we want to cut taxes on domestic production and all manufacturing. And just as we did before, we will provide 100% expensing. It will be retroactive to January 20th, 2025.\n\nAnd it was one of the main reasons why our tax cuts were so successful in our first term, giving us the most successful economy in the history of our country. First term, we had a great first term. And if you don't make your product in America, however, under the Trump administration, you will pay a tariff and in some cases a rather large one. Other countries have used tariffs against us for decades, and now it's our turn to start using them against those other countries. On average, the European Union, China, Brazil, India, Mexico and Canada. Have you heard of them? And countless other nations charge us tremendously higher tariffs than we charge them. It's very unfair. India charges us auto tariffs higher than 100%. China's average tariff on our products is twice what we charge them. And South Korea's average tariff is four times higher. Think of that, four times higher. And we give so much help militarily and in so many other ways to South Korea.\n\nBut that's what happens. This is happening by friend and foe. This system is not fair to the United States and never was. And so on April 2nd, I wanted to make an April 1st, but I didn't want to be accused of April Fool's Day. That's what one day would cost us, a lot of money, but we're going to do it in April. I'm a very superstitious person. April 2nd reciprocal tariffs kick in and whatever they tariff us, other countries, we will tariff them. That's reciprocal back and forth. Whatever they tax us, we will tax them.\n\nIf they do non-monetary tariffs to keep us out of their market, then we will do non-monetary barriers to keep them out of our market. It's a lot of that too. They don't even allow us in that market. We will take in trillions and trillions of dollars and create jobs like we have never seen before. I did it with China and I did it with others and the Biden administration couldn't do anything about it because there was so much money. They couldn't do anything about it. We've been ripped off for decades by nearly every country on Earth, and we will not let that happen any longer. Much has been said over the last three months about Mexico and Canada, but we have very large deficits with both of them. But even more importantly, they've allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens and many very young, beautiful people destroying families. Nobody's ever seen anything like it.\n\nThey are, in effect, receiving subsidies of hundreds of billions of dollars. We pay subsidies to Canada and to Mexico, have hundreds of billions of dollars in the United States, will not be doing that any longer. We're not going to do it any longer.\n\nThanks to our America First policies we're putting into place, we have had $1.7 trillion of new investment in America in just the past few weeks. The combination of the election and our economic policies that people love. SoftBank, one of the most brilliant anywhere in the world, announced a $200 billion investment. OpenAI and Oracle, Larry Ellison, announced $500 billion investment, which they wouldn't have done if Kamala had won. Apple announced $500 billion investment. Tim Cook called me, said, I cannot spend it fast enough, it's got to be much higher than that. I believe they'll be building their plants here instead of in China. And just yesterday, Taiwan Semiconductor, the biggest in the world's most powerful in the world, has a tremendous amount - 97% of the market - announced a $165 billion investment to build the most powerful chips on Earth right here in the U.S.A. And we're not giving them any money.\n\nYour CHIPS Act is a horrible, horrible thing. We give hundreds of billions of dollars and it doesn't mean a thing. They take our money and they don't spend it. All that meant to them. We're giving them no money. All that was important to them was they didn't want to pay the tariffs. So they came and they're building. And many other companies are coming. We don't have to give them money, we just want to protect our businesses and our people, and they will come because they won't have to pay tariffs if they build in America. So it's very amazing. You should get rid of the CHIPS Act and whatever's left over, Mr. Speaker, you should use it to reduce debt or any other reason you want to.\n\nA new trade policy will also be great for the American farmer. I love the farmer. We'll now be selling it to our home market in the U.S.A., because nobody is going to be able to compete with you. Because those goods that come in from other countries and companies, they're really, really in a bad position in so many different ways. They're uninspected. They may be very dirty and disgusting and they come in and they pour in and they hurt our American farmers.\n\nThe tariffs will go on agricultural product coming into America and our farmers starting on April 2nd, it may be a little bit of an adjustment period, we had that before when I made the deal with China, $50 billion of purchases and I said, just bear with me. And they did, they did. You really have to bear with me again and this will be even better. That was great. The problem with it was that Biden didn't enforce it. He didn't enforce it. $50 billion of purchases. And we were doing great. But Biden did not enforce it, and it hurt our farmers. But our farmers are going to have a field day right now. So to our farmers, have a lot of fun. I love you, too. I love you too.\n\nAnd I have also imposed a 25% tariff on foreign aluminum, copper, lumber and steel because if we don't have, as an example, steel and lots of other things, we don't have a military and frankly we just won't have a country very long. Here today is a proud American steelworker, fantastic person from Decatur, Alabama. Jeff Denard has been working at the same steel plant for 27 years in a job that has allowed him to serve as the captain of his local volunteer fire department, raise seven children with his beautiful wife, Nicole, and over the years provide a loving home for more than 40 foster children. So great, Jeff. Thank you, Jeff. Stories like Jeff's remind us that tariffs are not just about protecting American jobs.\n\nThey're about protecting the soul of our country. Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again. And it's happening. And it will happen rather quickly. There'll be a little disturbance, but we're okay with that. It won't be much. No you're not, oh. And look, look where Biden took us, it's very low, the lowest we've ever been.\n\nJeff, I want to thank you very much. And I also want to recognize another person who has devoted herself to foster care community. She worked so hard on it, her very loving person, our magnificent first lady of the United States. Melania's work has yielded incredible results, helping prepare our nation's future leaders as they enter the workforce.\n\nOur first lady is joined by two impressive young women. Very impressive. Haley Ferguson, who benefited from the First Ladies Fostering the Future initiative and is poised to complete her education, become a teacher. And Allison Berry, who became a victim of an illicit, deepfake image produced by a peer. With Allison's help, the Senate just passed the Take It Down Act, and this is so important. Thank you very much, John Thune. Thank you, Senator. Thank you, John. Thank you all very much. Thank you.\n\nAnd thank you to John Thune and the Senate. Great job to criminalize the publication of such images online. Just terrible, terrible thing. And once it passes the House, I look forward to signing that bill into law. Thank you. And I'm going to use that bill for myself, too, if you don't mind. There's nobody gets treated worse than I do online. Nobody. That's great. Thank you very much to the Senate. Thank you.\n\nBut if we truly care about protecting America's children, no step is more crucial than securing America's borders. Over the past four years, 21 million people poured into the United States, many of them were murderers, human traffickers, gang members, and other criminals from the streets of dangerous cities all throughout the world because of Joe Biden's insane and very dangerous open border policies. They are now strongly embedded in our country. But we are getting them out and getting them out fast. And I want to thank Tom Homan and Kristi, I want to thank you, and Paul and Border Patrol. I want to thank you. What a job they've all done. Everybody. Border Patrol, ICE, law enforcement in general is incredible. We have to take care of our law enforcement.\n\nLast year, a brilliant 22 year-old nursing student named Laken Riley, the best in her class, admired by everybody, went out for a jog on the campus of the University of Georgia. That morning Laken was viciously attacked, assaulted, beaten, brutalized, and horrifically murdered. Lincoln was stolen from us by a savage illegal alien gang member who was arrested while trespassing across Biden's open southern border and then sent loose into the United States under the heartless policies of that failed administration. It was indeed a failed administration. He had then been arrested and released in a Democrat-run sanctuary city, a disaster, before ending the life of this beautiful young angel. With us this evening, our Laken's beloved mother Allyson and her sister Lauren.\n\nLast year, I told Laken's grieving parents that we would ensure their daughter would not have died in vain. That's why the very first bill I signed into law as your 47th president mandates the detention of all dangerous criminal aliens who threaten public safety. Very strong, powerful act. It's called the Laken Riley Act. So, Allyson and Lauren, America will never, ever forget our beautiful Laken Hope Riley. Thank you very much.\n\nSince taking office, my administration has launched the most sweeping border and immigration crackdown in American history. And we quickly achieved the lowest numbers of illegal border crossers ever recorded. Thank you. The media and our friends in the Democrat Party kept saying we needed new legislation, we must have legislation to secure the border. But it turned out that all we really needed was a new president. Joe Biden didn't just open our borders. He flew illegal aliens over them to overwhelm our schools, hospitals and communities throughout the country. Entire towns like Aurora, Colorado and Springfield, Ohio, buckled under the weight of the migrant occupation and corruption like nobody's ever seen before. Beautiful towns destroyed. Now, just as I promised in my inaugural address, we are achieving the great liberation of America. But there still is much work to be done.\n\nHere tonight is a woman I have gotten to know, Alexis Nungaray from Houston. Wonderful woman. Last June, Alexis' 12-year-old daughter, her precious Jocelyn, walked to a nearby convenience store. She was kidnapped, tied up, assaulted for two hours under a bridge, and horrifically murdered. Arrested and charged with this heinous crime are two illegal alien monsters from Venezuela released into America by the last administration through their ridiculous open border.\n\nThe death of this beautiful 12-year-old girl and the agony of her mother and family touched our entire nation greatly. Alexis, I promised that we would always remember your daughter, your magnificent daughter. And earlier tonight, I signed an order keeping my word to you. One thing I have learned about Jocelyn is that she loved animals so much. She loved nature. Across Galveston Bay, from where Jocelyn lived in Houston you will find a magnificent national wildlife refuge, a pristine, peaceful, 34,000-acre sanctuary for all of God's creatures on the edge of the Gulf of America.\n\nAlexis. Moments ago, I formally renamed that refuge in loving memory of your beautiful daughter, Jocelyn. Mr. Vice President, if you would, may I have the order? Thank you very much. All three savages charged with Jocelyn and Laken's murders were members of the Venezuelan prison gang. The toughest gang, they say, in the world known as Tren de Aragua. Two weeks ago, I officially designated this gang, along with MS-13 and the bloodthirsty Mexican drug cartels, as foreign terrorist organizations. They are now officially in the same category as ISIS, and that's not good for them. Countless thousands of these terrorists were welcomed into the U.S. by the Biden administration. But now every last one will be rounded up and forcibly removed from our country. Or, if they are too dangerous, put in jails, standing trial in this country because we don't want them to come back ever.\n\nWith us this evening is a warrior on the frontline of that battle. Border Patrol agent Roberto Ortiz, great guy. In January, Roberto and another agent were patrolling by the Rio Grande near an area known as Cartel Island. Doesn't sound too nice to me. When heavily armed gunmen started shooting at them, Roberto saw that his partner was totally exposed to great danger, and he leapt into action, returning fire and providing crucial seconds for his fellow agent to seek safety, and just barely. I have some of the prints of that event and it was not good. Agent Ortiz, we salute you for your great courage and your line of fire that you took and for the bravery that you showed. We honor you, and we will always honor you. Thank you, Roberto, very much. And I actually got to know him on my many calls to the border. He's a great, great gentleman. The territory to the immediate south of our border is now dominated entirely by criminal cartels that murder, rape, torture and exercise total control. They have total control over a whole nation. posing a grave threat to our national security.\n\nThe cartels are waging war in America, and it's time for America to wage war on the cartels. Five nights ago, Mexican authorities, because of our tariff policies being imposed on them, think of this, handed over to us 29 of the biggest cartel leaders in their country. That has never happened before. They want to make us happy. First time ever. But we need Mexico and Canada to do much more than they've done, and they have to stop the fentanyl and drugs pouring into the U.S.A. They're going to stop it.\n\nI have sent Congress a detailed funding request, laying out exactly how we will eliminate these threats to protect our homeland and complete the largest deportation operation in American history. Larger even than current record holder President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a moderate man but someone who believed very strongly in borders. Americans expect Congress to send me this funding without delay so I can sign it into law. So, Mr. Speaker, John Thune, both of you, I hope you're going to be able to do that. Mr. Speaker, thank you, Mr. Leader, thank you. Thank you very much. And let's get it to me. I'll sign it so fast you won't even believe it.\n\nAnd as we reclaim our sovereignty, we must also bring back law and order to our cities and towns. In recent years, our justice system has been turned upside down by radical left lunatics.\n\nMany jurisdictions virtually ceased enforcing the law against dangerous repeat offenders while weaponizing law enforcement against political opponents like me. My administration has acted swiftly and decisively to restore fair, equal and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law. Starting at the FBI and the DOJ, Pam. Good luck. Kash, wherever you may be. Good luck, good luck. Pam Bondi. Good luck. So important. Gonna to do a great job. Kash. Thank you, thank you, thank you, Kash.\n\nThey have already started very strong. They're going to do a fantastic job. You're going to be very proud of them. We're also once again giving our police officers the support, protection and respect they show dearly deserve. They have to get it. They have such a hard, dangerous job. But we're going to make it less dangerous. The problem is the bad guys don't respect the law, but they're starting to respect it, and they soon will respect it.\n\nThis also includes our great fire departments throughout the country. Our firemen and women are unbelievable people, and I will never forget them. And besides that, they voted for me in record numbers. So I have no choice.\n\nOne year ago this month, 31-year-old New York police officer Jonathan Diller, unbelievably wonderful person and a great officer, was gunned down at a traffic stop on Long Island. I went to his funeral. A vicious criminal charged with his murder had 21 prior arrests -- and they were rough arrests, too. He was a real bad one. The thug in the seat next to him had 14 prior arrests, and went by the name of Killer. He was Killer. He killed other people, they say, a lot of them. I attended Officer Tiller's service, and when I met his wife and one-year-old son, Ryan, it was very inspirational, actually. His widow's name is Stephanie and she is here tonight. Thank you very much Stephanie. Thank you very much.\n\nStephanie, we're going to make sure that Ryan knows his dad was a true hero. New York's finest. And we're going to get these cold-blooded killers and repeat offenders off our streets. And we're going to do it fast. Gotta stop it. They get out with 28 arrests. They push people into subway trains. They hit people over the head, back of the head with baseball bats. We got to get him out of here.\n\nI've already signed an executive order requiring a mandatory death penalty for anyone who murders a police officer. And tonight, I'm asking Congress to pass that policy into permanent law.\n\nI'm also asking for a new crime bill getting tougher on repeat offenders while enhancing protections for America's police officers so they can do their jobs without fear of their lives being totally destroyed. They don't want to be killed. We're not going to let them be killed.\n\nJoining us to the gallery tonight is a young man who truly loves our police. His name is D.J. Daniel. He is 13 years old, and he has always dreamed of becoming a police officer. But in 2018, D.J. was diagnosed with brain cancer. The doctors gave him five months, at most, to live. That was more than six years ago. Since that time, D.J. and his dad have been on a quest to make his dream come true. And D.J. has been sworn in as an honorary law enforcement officer. Actually, a number of times. The police love him. The police departments love him. And tonight, D.J., we're going to do you the biggest honor of them all. I am asking our new Secret Service director, Sean Curran, to officially make you an agent of the United States secret Service. Thank you, D.J.\n\nD.J.'s doctors believe his cancer likely came from a chemical he was exposed to when he was younger. Since 1975, rates of child cancer have increased by more than 40%. Reversing this trend is one of the top priorities for our new presidential commission to Make America Healthy Again, chaired by our new Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. With a name Kennedy, you would have thought everybody over here would have been cheering. How quickly they forget.\n\nOur goal is to get toxins out of our environment, poisons out of our food supply, and keep our children healthy and strong. As an example, not long ago - and you can't even believe these numbers - one in 10,000 children had autism. One in 10,000, and now it's one in 36. There's something wrong. One in 36. Think of that. So, we're going to find out what it is, and there's nobody better than Bobby and all of the people that are working with you. You have the best to figure out what is going on. Okay, Bobby. Good luck. It's a very important job. Thank you.\n\nMy administration is also working to protect children from toxic ideologies in our schools. A few years ago, January Littlejohn and her husband discovered that their daughter's school had secretly socially transitioned their 13-year-old little girl. Teachers and administrators conspired to deceive January and her husband while encouraging their daughter to use a new name and pronouns--they/them pronouns, actually - or without telling January, who is here tonight and is now a courageous advocate against this form of child abuse. January, thank you. Thank you.\n\nStories like this are why, shortly after taking office, I signed an executive order banning public schools from indoctrinating our children with transgender ideology. I also signed an order to cut off all taxpayer funding to any institution that engages in the sexual mutilation of our youth. And now, I want Congress to pass a bill permanently banning and criminalizing sex changes on children and forever ending the lie that any child is trapped in the wrong body. This is a big lie. And our message to every child in America is that you are perfect exactly the way God made you.\n\nBecause we're getting wokeness out of our schools and out of our military, and it's already out, and it's out of our society. We don't want it. Wokeness is trouble. Wokeness is bad. It's gone. It's gone. And we feel so much better for it. Don't we? Don't we feel better? Our service members won't be activists and ideologues. They will be fighters and warriors. They will fight for our country and Pete, congratulations, secretary of defense. And he's not big into the woke movement, I can tell you. I know him well.\n\nI am pleased to report that in January, the U.S. Army had its single best recruiting month in 15 years and that all armed services are having among the best recruiting results ever in the history of our services. What a difference. And, you know, it was just a few months ago where the results were exactly the opposite. We couldn't recruit anywhere. We couldn't recruit. Now we're having the best results.\n\nAnd, you know, it was just a few months ago where the results were exactly the opposite. We couldn't recruit anywhere. We couldn't recruit. Now we're having the best results just about that we've ever had. What a tremendous turnaround. It's really a beautiful thing to see. People love our country again. It's very simple. They love our country and they love being in our military again. So it's a great thing. And thank you very much. Great job.\n\nWe're joined tonight by a young man, Jason Hartley, who knows the weight of that call of duty. Jason's father, grandfather and great-grandfather all wore the uniform. Jason tragically lost his dad, who was also a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy, when he was just a boy and now he wants to carry on the family legacy of service. Jason is a senior in high school, a six-letter varsity athlete - a really good athlete, they say. A brilliant student with a 4.46 - that's good - GPA and his greatest dream is to attend the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.\n\nAnd Jason, that's a very big deal getting in. That's a hard one to get into. But I'm pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted. You'll soon be joining the Corps of Cadets.\n\nThank you. Jason, you're going to be on the Long Gray Line, Jason. As commander in chief, my focus is on building the most powerful military of the future. As a first step, I'm asking Congress to fund a state of the art \"golden dome\" missile defense shield to protect our homeland. All made in the U.S.A.\n\nRonald Reagan wanted to do it long ago, but the technology just wasn't there. Not even close. But now we have the technology. It's incredible, actually.\n\nAnd other place - they have it. Israel has it. Other places have it. And the United States should have it too, right? Kim. Right. They should have it too. So I want to thank you, but it's a very, very important. This is a very dangerous world. We should have it. We want to be protected and we're going to protect our citizens like never before.\n\nTo boost our defense industrial base, we are also going to resurrect the American shipbuilding industry, including commercial shipbuilding and military shipbuilding. And for that purpose, I am announcing tonight that we will create a new office of shipbuilding in the White House and offer special tax incentives to bring this industry home to America, where it belongs.\n\nWe used to make so many ships. We don't make them anymore very much, but we're going to make them very fast, very soon. It will have a huge impact.\n\nTo further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we've already started doing it.\n\nJust today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals. The Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others. But others could use it.\n\nBut it was built at tremendous cost of American blood and treasure. 38,000 workers died building the Panama Canal. They died of malaria. They died of snakebites and mosquitoes. Not a nice place to work.\n\nThey paid them very highly to go there, knowing there was a 25% chance that they would die. The most expensive project also that was ever built in our country's history if you bring it up to modern-day costs. It was given away by the Carter administration for $1. But that agreement has been violated very severely.\n\nWe didn't give it to China, we gave it to Panama, and we're taking it back.\n\nNow we have Marco Rubio in charge. Good luck, Marco. Now we know who to blame if anything goes wrong. Marco has been amazing, and he's going to do a great job. Think of it. He got 100 votes. You know, he was approved with actually 99, but the 100th was this gentleman. And I feel very certain, so let's assume we got 100 votes. And I'm either very, very happy about that or I'm very concerned about it.\n\nBut he's already proven - I mean, he's a great gentleman. He's respected by everybody. And we appreciate you voting for Marco. He's going to do a fantastic job. Thank you, thank you. He's doing a great job. Great job.\n\nAnd I also have a message tonight for the incredible people of Greenland. We strongly support your right to determine your own future, and if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America.\n\nWe need Greenland for national security and even international security. And we're working with everybody involved to try and get it. But we need it really for international world security. And I think we're going to get it. One way or the other, we're going to get it.\n\nWe will keep you safe. We will make you rich. And together we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before.\n\nIt's a very small population, but very, very large piece of land and very, very important for military security.\n\nAmerica is once again standing strong against the forces of radical Islamic terrorism.\n\nThree and a half years ago, ISIS terrorists killed 13 American service members and countless others in the Abbey Gate bombing during the disastrous and incompetent withdrawal from Afghanistan. Not that they were withdrawing. It was the way they withdrew. Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country.\n\nTonight, I am pleased to announce that we have just apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity. And he is right now on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice.\n\nAnd I want to thank, especially, the government of Pakistan for helping arrest this monster. This was a very momentous day for those 13 families who I actually got to know very well, most of them, whose children were murdered, and the many people that were so badly, over 42 people so badly injured on that fateful day in Afghanistan.\n\nWhat a horrible day. Such incompetence was shown that when Putin saw what happened, I guess he said, wow, maybe this is my chance. That's how bad it was. Should have never happened. Grossly incompetent people.\n\nI spoke to many of the parents and loved ones and they're all in our hearts tonight. I spoke to them on the phone. We had a big call. Every one of them called and everybody was on the line and they did nothing but cry with happiness. They were very happy. It's happy as you can be under those circumstances. Their child, brother, sister, son, daughter was killed for no reason whatsoever.\n\nIn the Middle East, we're bringing back our hostages from Gaza. In my first term, we achieved one of the most groundbreaking peace agreements in generations: the Abraham Accords. And now we're going to build on that foundation, to create a more peaceful and prosperous future for the entire region.\n\nA lot of things are happening in the Middle East. People haven't been talking about that so much lately, with everything going on with Ukraine and Russia, a lot of things are happening in the Middle East. A rough neighborhood actually.\n\nI'm also working tirelessly to end the savage conflict in Ukraine. Millions of Ukrainians and Russians have been needlessly killed or wounded in this horrific and brutal conflict, with no end in sight.\n\nThe United States has sent hundreds of billions of dollars to support Ukraine's defense, with no security, with no way. Do you want to keep it going for another five years? Yeah, yeah, you would say, \"Pocahontas says yes.\"\n\n2000 people are being killed every single week. More than that. They are Russian young people. They're Ukrainian young people. They're not Americans. But I want it to stop.\n\nMeanwhile, Europe has sadly spent more money buying Russian oil and gas than they have spent on defending Ukraine by far. Think of that. They've spent more buying Russian oil and gas than they have defending.\n\nAnd we've spent perhaps $350 billion. Like taking candy from a baby. That's what happened. And they've spent $100 billion. What a difference that is. And we have an ocean separating us. And they don't. But we're getting along very well with them. And lots of good things are happening.\n\nBiden has authorized more money in this fight than Europe has spent by billions and billions of dollars. It's hard to believe that they wouldn't have stopped it and said at some point, come on, let's equalize. You got to be equal to us. That didn't happen.\n\nEarlier today, I received an important letter from President Zelenskyy of Ukraine. The letter reads: 'Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians,\" he said. \"My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to get a peace that lasts. We do really value how much America has done to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty and independence. Regarding the agreement on minerals and security, Ukraine is ready to sign it at any time that is convenient for you.\"\n\nI appreciate that he sent this letter, just got it a little while ago. Simultaneously, we've had serious discussion with Russia and have received strong signals that they are ready for peace.\n\nWouldn't that be beautiful? Wouldn't that be beautiful? Wouldn't that be beautiful?\n\nIt's time to stop this madness. It's time to halt the killing. It's time to end this senseless war.\n\nIf you want to end wars, you have to talk to both sides.\n\nNearly four years ago, amid rising tensions, a history teacher named Mark Fogel was detained in Russia and sentenced to 14 years at a penal colony. Rough stuff. The previous administration barely lifted a finger to help him. They knew he was innocent, but they had no idea where to begin.\n\nBut last summer, I promised his 95-year-old mother, Malphine, that we would bring her boy safely back home. After 22 days in office, I did just that. And they are here tonight.\n\nTo Mark and his great mom: We are delighted to have you safe and sound and with us.\n\nAs fate would have it, Mark Fogel was born in a small, rural town in Butler, Pennsylvania. Have you heard of it? Where his mother has lived for the past 78 years. I just happened to go there last July 13th for a rally.\n\nThat was not pleasant. And that is where I met his beautiful mom right before I walked onto that stage. And I told her I would not forget what she said about her son. And I never did that, did I? Never forgot.\n\nLess than 10 minutes later, at that same rally, gunfire rang out and a sick and deranged assassin unloaded eight bullets from his sniper's perch into a crowd of many thousands of people.\n\nMy life was saved by a fraction of an inch, but some were not so lucky. Corey Comperatore was a firefighter, a veteran, a Christian, a husband, a devoted father, and above all, a protector. When the sound of gunshots pierced the air, it was a horrible sound. Corey knew instantly what it was and what to do. He threw himself on top of his wife and daughters and shielded them from the bullets with his own body. Corey was hit really hard. You know the story from there. He sacrificed his life to save theirs. Two others, very fine people, were also seriously hit, but thankfully, with the help of two great country doctors- - we thought they were gone and they were saved - so those doctors had great talent. We're joined by Corey's wife, Helen, who was his high school sweetheart, and their two beloved daughters, Allison and Kaylee. Thank you.\n\nTo Helen, Allison and Kaylee: Corey is looking down on his three beautiful ladies right now, and he is cheering you on. He loves you. He is cheering you on. Corey was taken from us much too soon, but his destiny was to leave us all with a shining example of the selfless devotion of a true American patriot. It was love like Corey's that built our country and it's love like Corey's that is going to make our country more majestic than ever before.\n\nI believe that my life was saved that day in Butler for a very good reason. I was saved by God to make America great again. I believe that. Thank you very much.\n\nFrom the patriots of Lexington and Concord, to the heroes of Gettysburg and Normandy, from the warriors who crossed the Delaware, to the trailblazers who climbed the Rockies, and from the legends who soared at Kitty Hawk, to the astronauts who touched the moon, Americans have always been the people who defied all odds, transcended all dangers, made the most extraordinary sacrifices, and did whatever it took to defend our children, our country, and our freedom.\n\nAs we have seen in this chamber tonight, that same strength, faith, love and spirit is still alive and thriving in the hearts of the American people. Despite the best efforts of those who would try to censor us, silence us, break us, destroy us, Americans are today a proud, free, sovereign and independent nation that will always be free, and we will fight for it 'til death. We will never let anything happen to our beloved country because we are a country of doers, dreamers, fighters and survivors.\n\nOur ancestors crossed a vast ocean, strode into the unknown wilderness, and carved their fortunes from the rock and soil of a perilous and very dangerous frontier. They chased our destiny across a boundless continent. They built the railroads, laid the highways, and graced the world with American marvels like the Empire State Building, the mighty Hoover Dam, and the towering Golden Gate Bridge. They lit the world with electricity, broke free of the force of gravity, fired up the engines of American industry, vanquished the communists, fascists and Marxists all over the world, and gave us countless modern wonders sculpted out of iron, glass and steel. We stand on the shoulders of these pioneers who won and built the modern age, these workers who poured their sweat into the skylines of our cities, these warriors who shed their blood on fields of battle and gave everything they had for our rights and for our freedom.\n\nNow it is our time to take up the righteous cause of American liberty, and it is our turn to take America's destiny into our own hands and begin the most thrilling days in the history of our country. This will be our greatest era. With God's help, over the next four years, we are going to lead this nation even higher, and we are going to forge the freest, most advanced, most dynamic and most dominant civilization ever to exist on the face of this Earth.\n\nWe are going to create the highest quality of life, build the safest and wealthiest and healthiest and most vital communities anywhere in the world. We are going to conquer the vast frontiers of science, and we are going to lead humanity into space and plant the American flag on the planet Mars, and even far beyond.\n\nAnd through it all, we are going to rediscover the unstoppable power of the American spirit. And we are going to renew unlimited promise of the American dream. Every single day we will stand up and we will fight, fight, fight for the country our citizens believe in and for the country our people deserve. My fellow Americans, get ready for an incredible future, because the golden Age of America has only just begun. It will be like nothing that has ever been seen before. Thank you. God bless you and God bless America.\n\n___\n\nThis transcript has been corrected to show the speech was March 4, not May 4.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Not even 24 hours after his party lost a key Wisconsin race and underperformed in Florida , President Donald Trump followed the playbook that has defined his political career: He doubled down.\n\nTrump's move Wednesday to place stiff new tariffs on imports from nearly all U.S. trading partners marks an all-in bet by the Republican that his once-fringe economic vision will pay off for Americans. It was the realization of his four decades of advocacy for a protectionist foreign policy and the belief that free trade was forcing the United States into decline as its economy shifted from manufacturing to services.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks during an event to announce new tariffs in the Rose Garden at the White House, Wednesday, April 2, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)\n\nThe tariff announcement was the latest and perhaps boldest manifestation of Trump's second-term freedom to lead with his instincts after feeling his first turn in the Oval Office was restrained by aides who did not share his worldview. How it shakes out could be a defining judgment on his presidency.\n\nThe early reviews have been worrisome.\n\nFinancial markets had their worst week since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, foreign trade partners retaliated and economists warned that the import taxes may boost inflation and potentially send the U.S. into a recession. It's now Republican lawmakers who are fretting about their party's future while Democrats feel newly buoyant over what they see as Trump's overreach.\n\nA screen displays financial news as traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange in New York, Thursday, April 3, 2025.

He insisted Thursday as the Dow Jones fell by 1,600 points that things were \"going very well\" and the economy would \"boom,\" then spent Friday at the golf course as the index plunged 2,200 more points.\n\nThe White House stayed the course Saturday. \"This past November, America resoundingly rejected the business-as-usual policies coming out of D.C.,\" said White House spokesman Kush Desai, adding, \"The entire Trump administration is aligned on delivering on President Trump's mandate to reject the status quo.\"\n\nA worker loads rolls of steel plate at a steel market in Hangzhou in east China's Zhejiang province, Monday, March 31, 2025. (Chinatopix Via AP)\n\nIn his first term, Trump's tariff threats brought world leaders to his door to cut deals. This time, his actions so far have led to steep retaliation from China and promises from European allies to push back.\n\nEven some Trump supporters are having their doubts.\n\nDemonstrators hold up signs during a \"Hands Off!\" protest against President Donald Trump at the Washington Monument in Washington, Saturday, April 5, 2025. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)\n\nFrank Amoroso, a 78-year-old resident of Dewitt, Michigan, said he is concerned about short-term rising interest rates and inflation, although he believes the tariffs will be good for the country in the long run.\n\nAmoroso, a retired automotive engineer who voted for Trump, said he would give the president's second-term performance a C-plus or B-minus. \"I think he's doing things too fast,\" he said. \"But hopefully things will get done in a prudent way, and the economy will survive a little downfall.\"\n\nRep. French Hill, R-Ark., in a telephone town hall with constituents Thursday night, expressed reservations about the broad nature of the tariffs.\n\nHill, who represents a district that includes Little Rock, said he does not back tariffs on Canada and Mexico. He said the administration should instead focus on renegotiating a U.S. trade agreement with its two neighbors.\n\n\"I don't support across-the-board tariffs as a general matter, and so I don't support those, and I will be urging changes there because I don't think they will end up raising a bunch of revenue that's been asserted,\" Hill said. \"I wish I thought they did, but personally I don't think they will. But I do support trade diplomacy.\"\n\nStill, much of Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" coalition remains publicly supportive.\n\nDoug Deason, a prominent Texas-based Republican donor, said he loves the president's tariff plan, even if it causes some economic disruption.\n\n\"He told us during the election there would be pain for every American to get this ship turned around,\" Deason said. \"It is hard to watch our portfolios deteriorate so much, but we get it. We hope he holds course.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., leads fellow Democrats in criticizing the Republican-backed budget plan during a news conference at the Capitol in Washington, Thursday, April 3, 2025.

New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker then breathed new life into the Democratic resistance by delivering a record 25-hour-long speech on the Senate floor that centered on a call for his party to find its resolve.\n\nBooker told The Associated Press afterward that a significant political shift has begun even as his party tries to learn from its mistakes in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nIn this image provided by Senate Television, Sen, Cory Booker, D-N.J. speaks on the Senate floor, Tuesday morning, April 1, 2025.

Ebenhack, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Charlie Kirk's $4.75 million Spanish-style estate is tucked away in a gated Arizona country club that charges nearly a half-million dollars for a golf membership. It boasts a guest casita, a \"resort-style\" pool and striking views of the Sonoran Desert.\n\nThe Make America Great Again political movement has been lucrative for Kirk, the 29-year-old CEO and co-founder of the conservative youth organization Turning Point.\n\nThe nonprofit rocketed to prominence by latching on to Donald Trump's 2016 campaign and has raised roughly a quarter-billion dollars since, much of it spent cultivating conservative influencers and hosting glitzy events. The organization also enriched Kirk and his allies, according to an Associated Press review of public records, which found top Turning Point officials collected pricey salaries, enjoyed lavish perks and steered at least $15.2 million to companies that they, their friends and associates are affiliated with.\n\nBut for all that money, the group has struggled to help Republicans win general elections. That's particularly true in Turning Point's adopted home of Arizona, where its slate of deeply conservative candidates in the longtime Republican stronghold lost statewide races last year, among them Kari Lake's unsuccessful bid for governor.\n\nNow, as its leaders age out of the youth movement, they are attempting to leverage Turning Point's connections and fundraising might to branch out. Ahead of the 2024 election, they are pitching a $108 million get-out-the vote campaign that would expand beyond Arizona to the swing states of Georgia and Wisconsin.\n\n\"Any donor who thinks an organization needs $108 million for a three-state grassroots get-out-the-vote campaign is being taken advantage of,\" said Erick Erickson, a nationally syndicated conservative talk radio host and frequent Trump critic. \"It sounds like a grift.\"\n\nWhile Turning Point isn't the first organization to draw scrutiny over spending, it has become a unique source of frustration for some Republicans. They point to its support for far-right candidates who struggled in marquee races, as well as the hefty sum it now seeks to do work that is already being done by veteran operatives. That sets up a potential clash between competing wings of the conservative movement that could complicate the GOP's effort to hold a House majority while reclaiming the Senate and the White House next year.\n\nIn a statement, Turning Point spokesman Andrew Kolvet said none of the group's leaders have inappropriately benefited from their financial arrangements. If anything, he said, many were underpaid for their talents, including Kirk.\n\n\"If the so-called 'experts' know what it takes to build successful ballot chasing teams, why are conservatives apparently so bad at it?\" Kolvet said. \"Why are we getting lapped by progressives in spending and in (get-out-the-vote) operations in key states and counties?\"\n\nTurning Point was founded in suburban Chicago in 2012 by Kirk, then 18, and William Montgomery, a tea party activist, to proselytize on college campuses for low taxes and limited government. It was not an immediate success.\n\nBut Kirk's zeal for confronting liberals in academia eventually won over an influential set of conservative financiers. It helped that the group operated solely as a nonprofit charity at the time, offering a tax write-off for contributions while cloaking donors' identities from disclosure.\n\nDespite early misgivings, Turning Point enthusiastically backed Trump after he clinched the GOP nomination in 2016. Kirk served as a personal aide to Donald Trump Jr., the former president's eldest son, during the general election campaign.\n\nSoon, Kirk was a regular presence on cable TV, where he leaned into the culture wars and heaped praise on the then-president. Trump and his son were equally effusive and often spoke at Turning Point conferences.\n\nContributions to the group doubled and then tripled - eventually climbing to $79.2 million in 2022, according to an analysis of publicly available tax filings. The group states that it now has a presence on nearly 4,000 high school and college campuses, operating as a conservative lifestyle brand that promotes hundreds of online influencers.\n\nAs their finances grew, Turning Point events became more ornate, taking on a nightclub atmosphere with strobe lights, pyrotechnics and thousands of young conservatives in attendance, many of whom had their expenses at least partially paid for by the group.\n\nCompensation also soared, with Kirk's climbing from $27,000 in 2016 to more than $407,000 by 2021, tax records show. Millions of dollars more were paid out to a cluster of companies linked to a handful of group leaders and their allies, according to tax documents and business filings.\n\nKirk bought three high-end properties, all worth over a million dollars, which include his new Spanish-style mansion near Phoenix, as well as a nearby apartment and a beachside condo on Florida's gulf coast.\n\nKolvet said that much of Kirk's wealth was derived from his successful podcast and radio show, as well as public speaking fees, though he declined to provide earnings figures. Still, Kirk used his platform at Turning Point to help launch those ventures, which occupy a considerable amount of his time and could conflict with the 75 hours a week that Turning Point says Kirk spent working on organization business in 2022, the most recent year tax data is available for.\n\nSpecifics about how exactly Turning Point spends its money - and who benefits - are often difficult to discern because the IRS does not require nonprofit groups to publicly disclose detailed accounts of their expenditures. Meanwhile, many of Turning Point's biggest vendors are limited liability companies that are registered in states that do not require public disclosure of ownership.\n\nThe group also adopted an opaque organizational structure, including a series of interconnected nonprofit groups, political action committees and a for-profit Turning Point merchandise company, which does not have to publicly report its finances.\n\nOne branch, the Turning Point Endowment, held more than $55 million in reserve in 2022, while donors were courted to give more.\n\nKolvet said the money was part of Turning Point's \"50-100 year plan to continue reaching generation after generation of young Americans.\" He added that the organization's leaders were \"good stewards of donor money.\"\n\nWhile building for the future, however, Turning Point has shown a willingness to spend lavishly.\n\nIn 2019, the group stated that its leaders would travel first-class or by charter plane, explaining later that it was needed in \"certain circumstances\" to \"ensure the uninterrupted success of the organization's mission.\"\n\nIn 2021, Turning Point sponsored a wedding reception for Kirk and his wife, Erika Frantzve, at the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess luxury hotel, which was also billed as a ninth anniversary celebration and fundraiser for the organization, according to an invitation obtained by the AP.\n\nKolvet said the event was separate from the couple's small wedding ceremony, describing it as an \"elegant and gracious way for Erika and Charlie to mark a landmark in the life of TPUSA (the 9th anniversary) while also inviting a much larger group of friends and family to celebrate a landmark in their own lives.\"\n\nOther expenditures defy easy explanation.\n\nA $999,000 payment was made to a limited liability company in Nevada for a \"research project on educational outputs,\" according to 2020 tax documents. The company, called Clocktower LLC, was dissolved in 2022 and the only corporate officer listed in its business filings is the president of a firm that advises on tax avoidance strategies.\n\nNicholas R. Miller, who is listed as the \"manager\" of Clocktower LLC, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\"Any insinuation that anyone\" at Turning Point \"benefited from this is defamatory,\" Kolvet said.\n\nIn 2020, Turning Point paid Donald Trump Jr. $333,000 through his company Pursuit Ventures. Kolvet said the money was used to purchase copies of a book he wrote that was offered as a gift during a fundraising drive.\n\nAnother individual in the former president's orbit, Trump's former bodyman John McEntee, also collected $107,500 for consulting work between 2021 and 2022, records show.\n\nIn one case, the money was used for purposes that belie the anodyne descriptions included in tax documents.\n\nDuring the 2020 presidential campaign, Jake Hoffman, one of the group's primary outside consultants, recruited teenagers to spread false information online about voter fraud and the coronavirus pandemic. That led Twitter and Facebook to suspend numerous accounts, as previously reported by the Washington Post.\n\nHoffman was paid $2.4 million during that period through his former company Rally Forge, according to tax documents that listed the purpose of the expenditures as \"digital education,\" \"media\" and \"ad placement.\" Now an Arizona state senator who also served as a fake elector for Trump, Hoffman has been paid at least $6.6 million by Turning Point since 2017, campaign finance disclosures and tax records show.\n\nHoffman did not respond to a request for comment made through his state Senate office.\n\nOther high-ranking employees also received a growing share of the organization's wealth, according to business filings and tax documents.\n\nMontgomery, Turning Point's co-founder, collected over $700,000 in compensation as well as payments to his companies, an arrangement ProPublica previously reported. He died in 2020.\n\nStacy Sheridan, Turning Point's senior advancement director, is listed as a corporate officer for three limited liability companies that have received at least $2.7 million since 2018. She earned $180,000 in compensation during Turning Point's 2018 fiscal year. Subsequent salary figures have not been disclosed. Sheridan did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nJoshua Thifault, Turning Point's senior director of major gifts, earned $443,000 between 2021 and 2022. A company he controls received an additional $129,000 for fundraising work during that time. Thifault did not respond to a message seeking comment at a number listed to him.\n\nBenny Johnson, Turning Point's former chief creative officer, collected at least $486,000 in compensation from the organization. Arsenal Media Group, a firm Johnson said he co-founded and helped operate, received $613,000 in payments between 2020 and 2021, according to tax records and an archived copy of his personal website.\n\nIn a statement, Alex Lorusso, a spokesman for Johnson, said he was \"never an owner or executive of Arsenal Media\" and \"any work Benny did with Arsenal was as an independent contractor.\"\n\nLegal experts say the payments could potentially pose a problem under federal tax regulations.\n\nThough enforcement is rare, payments made to companies controlled by those with \"substantial influence\" over a nonprofit's operations could violate IRS rules related to \"self-dealing\" if the payments are deemed to be excessive.\n\nAs Kirk's star has risen, Tyler Bowyer, Turning Point's chief operating officer, has assumed a greater role in the organization. Like Kirk, his improving financial circumstances coincided with Turning Point's fundraising success.\n\nNow in his late 30s, Bowyer endured several financially rocky years, losing two condos to foreclosure in 2011 amid a divorce. His wages were garnished after a home ownership association sued him for thousands of dollars in unpaid fees, according to property and court records.\n\nHe now operates Turning Point's political arm, earning compensation of $255,000 in the group's 2022 fiscal year. In 2021, he purchased a $1.95 million \"urban farm\" in Mesa, Arizona, after placing a $650,000 down payment, according to property records. And he has a 2020 Tige ski boat, which sells on the used market for as much as $200,000, that is held under his wife's name, loan collateral documents show.\n\nKolvet said Bowyer's home is not as fancy as it appears, requiring a \"badly needed\" renovation that he can't currently afford. He shares the Tige ski boat with his wife's family, which costs him only $350 a month, Kolvet said.\n\nBowyer, who is an Arizona representative to the Republican National Committee and also served as a fake elector for Trump, is now helping lead a commercial endeavor that could prove lucrative.\n\nBusiness filings show Bowyer recently became chairman of the board for Superfeed Technologies, a mobile app maker that developed the platform Turning Point will use to manage get-out-the-vote campaigns, like the $108 million effort they are now raising money for. Kirk's mother-in-law also sits on the board.\n\nKolvet said that Turning Point's leaders, as well as Kirk's mother-in-law, have not \"earned a dime\" from the company, viewing their work as \"a form of charity for the conservative movement.\"\n\nTurning Point's machinations have sounded alarms from their more established rivals, who view the organization as inexperienced when it comes to running a successful general election ground operation.\n\nLast year, Turning Point operated a get-out-vote campaign in Arizona and a handful of other states. But operatives saw little indication that the group was leading the robust operation it claimed. The digital platform they used for canvassers to gather voter data at the time was barely used, according to internal documents obtained by the AP.\n\nOthers, including Jon Seaton, a former aide to Arizona Sen. John McCain, said the amount of money sought by Turning Point was objectionable.\n\n\"$108 million? I can't even fathom it,\" said Seaton, who specializes in get-out-the vote efforts. \"There's not even enough doors\" to knock on.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Jonathan J.

(AP Photo/Charles Dharapak)\n\nPHOENIX (AP) - The Democratic base is angry.\n\nNot just at President Donald Trump , Elon Musk and the \"Make America Great Again\" movement. Rank-and-file Democrats are mad at their own leaders and increasingly agitating to replace them.\n\nDemocrats in Arizona and Georgia pushed out their party chairs. And Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York postponed a book tour in the face of protests amid calls from progressives that he face a primary challenge.\n\nThe losing party after a presidential election often spends time in the wilderness, but the visceral anger among Democrats toward their party leaders is reaching a level reminiscent of the tea party movement that swept out Republican incumbents 15 years ago.\n\n\"They should absolutely be worried about holding onto power, because there's a real energy right now against them,\" Paco Fabián, deputy director of Our Revolution, a grassroots group allied with independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders , said of Democratic incumbents. \"And as soon as somebody figures out how to harness it, they're going to be in deep trouble.\"\n\nElections on Tuesday could give national Democrats a boost. In Wisconsin, the officially nonpartisan race for a state Supreme Court seat has become a test of Musk's influence as his political organization boosts conservative Brad Schimel and progressives back liberal Susan Crawford, who has made anti-Musk messaging a centerpiece of her campaign. And two U.S. House special elections in Florida feature Democrats who are outraising their Republican counterparts in sharply pro-Trump districts.\n\nBut the current depth of frustration among Democrats is clear and shows no signs of going away.\n\nAccording to a February Quinnipiac poll , about half disapprove of how Democrats in Congress are handling their job, compared with about 4 in 10 who approve. That's a stark contrast from the beginning of Joe Biden's presidency in 2021, when more than 8 in 10 Democrats approved of how their party was doing its job in Congress, and the start of Trump's first term in 2017, when about 6 in 10 Democrats approved . In 2017, as they do now, Democrats lacked control of either congressional chamber.\n\nA February CNN/SSRS poll found about three-quarters of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents thought Democrats in Congress weren't doing enough to oppose Trump.\n\nFacing a coordinated and long-planned Republican effort to remake government and fire tens of thousands of federal workers, Democrats have struggled with a unified response.\n\nFrustration on the left with elected Democrats began early, when some Democratic senators backed Trump Cabinet nominees and supported legislation targeting illegal immigration. It escalated following Trump's joint address to Congress, when Democratic lawmakers protested by wearing coordinated clothes and holding up signs expressing their discontent. A handful of Democrats then voted with Republicans to censure U.S. Rep. Al Green , D-Texas, who interrupted Trump's speech to Congress and was escorted out of the chamber.\n\nSchumer faced the most serious backlash after he refused to block a Republican-led government spending bill and shut down the government. Schumer said blocking the bill would have backfired and played into Trump's hands, but many on the left saw it as capitulation.\n\n\"I want the opposition to be a lot more animated,\" said Stefan Therrien, a 22-year-old engineering student in Tempe, Arizona, who called Democratic leaders in Congress \"very passive\" in a misguided effort to appeal to centrists. \"Democrats should attack harder.\"\n\nKen Human, a retired attorney who went to a town hall organized by Democrats in Lexington, Kentucky, said: \"You have to stand up to bullies because otherwise they'll walk all over you.\"\n\nAnger from a party's base is not unusual after a party loses the presidency.\n\nEstablishment Republicans faced fierce backlash after Democrat Barack Obama was elected president in 2008, which fueled the rise of the tea party movement that overthrew some of the party's most powerful incumbents and brought in a new cadre of lawmakers laser-focused on obstructing Obama's agenda.\n\nDemocrats, likewise, were dejected after Republican President George W. Bush was reelected in 2004, but his popularity soon tanked and Democrats could foresee the massive wins they would notch in the 2006 midterms, said Robert Shapiro, a Columbia University professor focused on American politics.\n\nRonald Reagan's victory in 1980 was a bigger shock to Democrats because it brought with it a period of Republican ascendance. The GOP won a Senate majority for the first time in nearly 30 years, though Democrats retained control of the House.\n\n\"The setback was significant and startling, but not as much as what's happened today, where you have Trump winning the election at the same time the Republicans have control of both houses of Congress,\" Shapiro said.\n\nGrassroots Democrats were incensed by Trump's first victory - with some talk then of primary challengers to leaders - but they mostly channeled their anger toward the president and the GOP, planning marches and organizing community groups to prepare for the midterms.\n\nThose midterms led to at least one primary upset with future implications: New York Rep. Joe Crowley, the No. 4 House Democrat, fell to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, then a virtual unknown.\n\nThousands have packed rallies to hear Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, outsiders who rose to prominence for their sharp criticism of the Democratic establishment.\n\nDemocrats are getting an earful from constituents at some of the town halls, including events they're organizing in GOP-controlled districts to draw attention to Republicans avoiding unscripted interactions with voters.\n\nIn Arizona, which went for Biden in 2020 before flipping to Trump last year, furious party leaders ousted their chair, Yolanda Bejarano. The result was a shock; Bejarano had support from every prominent Democrat in the state and was widely expected to get a second term.\n\nU.S. Rep. Nikema Williams, the chair of the Georgia Democratic Party, met a similar fate after Trump flipped Georgia in 2024. Williams resigned as party chair on Monday, days after the Democratic state committee approved a rules change making its chairmanship a full-time role, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. The rule made it untenable for Williams to continue as chair through the end of her term in 2027 while keeping her congressional seat.\n\nKat Abughazaleh, a 26-year-old liberal journalist with a big social media following, decided to run for Congress, saying most Democrats \"work from an outdated playbook\" in an announcement video that's fiercely critical of party leaders.\n\n\"They aren't meeting the moment, and their constituents are absolutely livid,\" Abughazaleh said in an interview. She said Rep. Jan Schakowsky, the 80-year-old Democrat who has represented a suburban Chicago district since 1999, has an \"admirable\" progressive record, but \"something needs to change culturally ... about how we do politics and how we campaign.\"\n\n\"I'm done sitting around waiting for someone else to maybe do it,\" Abughazaleh said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Bruce Schreiner in Lexington, Ky., contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew)\n\nA notice to customers dazzled by the low-priced products on Chinese shopping apps: the days of getting trendy clothing, tools and gag gifts that cost less than lunch delivered to your door in 10 days are probably numbered.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is ending a little-known but widely used exemption that has allowed as many as 4 million low-value parcels - most of them originating in China - to arrive in the U.S. every day tax-free.\n\nAn executive order the president signed Wednesday will eliminate the \"de minimis provision\" for goods from China and Hong Kong on May 2. The tax exemption, which applies to packages valued at $800 or less, has helped China-founded e-commerce companies like Shein and Temu to thrive while cutting into the U.S. retail market.\n\n\"Shoppers had a full array of product and options of timing,\" Marshal Cohen, chief retail advisor at market research firm Circana, said. \"Now, they're going to have a limited array of options and timing: so you can still buy this product, but you may have to wait three or four weeks.\"\n\nU.S. politicians, law enforcement agencies and business groups have described the long-standing policy as a trade loophole that gave inexpensive Chinese goods an advantage and served as a portal for illicit drugs and counterfeits to enter the country.\n\nThe sweeping tariffs Trump announced on Wednesday also aim to end the duty-free exception for all imported goods worth less than $800, but only when the U.S. government has the personnel in place to process parcels from every country.\n\nA White House fact sheet said small packages of Chinese products sent through the international postal network will be subject to a duty rate of either 30% of their value or $25 per item, an amount that will increase to $50 per item after June 1.\n\nCommercial carriers such as FedEx and UPS will be required to report shipment details and remit the appropriate duties to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, according to the White House. After Trump's latest round of tariffs, the tariff rate for Chinese products will be at least 54% .\n\nSupporters of the de minimis exception have argued that its elimination would drive up costs and hurt low-income consumers and small businesses .\n\nThe tariff costs threaten to deal a blow to the U.S. operations of companies like Shein and Temu, which rapidly expanded in the U.S. using the de minimis provision to deliver ultra-cheap fast fashion items from China.\n\nHowever, it's unclear what impact the loss of the tax exemption will have on the two online retailers, as well as on American companies like Amazon and Walmart, whose platforms include virtual marketplaces where international sellers offer products.\n\nShein and Temu already have been building warehouses in the U.S. so they could get orders to U.S. shoppers more quickly. Shein recently opened a fulfillment and logistics hub in the Seattle area. Neither company could be reached for comment Thursday.\n\nPages from the Shein website, left, and from the Temu site, right, are shown in this photo, in New York, June 23, 2023. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, FIle)\n\nRam Ben Tzion, chief executive officer of the digital vetting platform Publican, said he expected the companies to \"be forced to rethink their business strategy and possibly explore opting out of the U.S. market.\"\n\nIn an emailed statement to AP, FedEx said it would support its customers to adapt to the new regulatory requirements and said it would be important for shippers to have \"paperwork completed correctly ahead of pick-up\" for shipments to move smoothly.\n\nHilton Beckham, an assistant commissioner of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said the federal agency was ready to implement the latest tariffs.\n\n\"Our automated systems are fully updated to capture, assess, and administer all new duties, and clear guidance will be provided to support uniform enforcement across the nation,\" Beckham said.\n\nBen Tzion, of Publican, said he would \"highly doubt\" the U.S. government was ready to process the huge number of low-value shipments to be taxed starting next month.\n\nThe Hong Kong government said the HongKong Post would \"temporarily maintain\" postal services to the U.S through May 2 but \"will not collect any so-called tariffs on behalf of the U.S. authorities.\"\n\nIntroduced in 1938, the de minimis exception was intended to facilitate the flow of small packages valued at no more than $5, the equivalent of about $109 today. The threshold increased to $200 in 1994 and $800 in 2016. But the rapid rise of cross-border e-commerce , driven by China, has challenged the intent of the decades-old customs exception rule.\n\nChinese exports of low-value packages soared to $66 billion in 2023, up from $5.3 billion in 2018, according to a February report by the Congressional Research Service. And the U.S. market has been a major destination.\n\nSouvenir apparel vendor Duane Jackson completes a sale of \"Make America Great Again\" caps, that are made in China, at his location in New York's Times Square, Tuesday, April 1, 2025. (AP Photo/Richard Drew)\n\nThe Chinese government, which sees cross-border e-commerce as a critical part of its foreign trade, has introduced favorable policies, including financial support and infrastructure building, to foster its growth.\n\nFormer President Joe Biden proposed a rule last year that said foreign companies can't avoid tariffs simply by shipping goods that they claim to be worth $800 or less. Trump tried in February to end the exception but his initial order was called off within days when it appeared the U.S. was not prepared to process and collect tariffs on the millions of parcels.\n\nU.S. Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro, a Democrat from Connecticut, said she was pleased Trump acted a second time to eliminate the rule.\n\n\"For too long, this customs loophole has let foreign exporters flood our market with cheap goods and helped drug traffickers move fentanyl past our borders - resulting in factory closures, job losses, and deaths,\" DeLauro said.\n\nIn 2023, for the first time, more than 1 billion such packages came through U.S. customs, up from 134 million in 2015. By the end of last year, Customs and Border Protection said it was processing about 4 million small shipments a day.\n\nThe cheap prices and increasing popularity of Shein and Temu squeezed fast-fashion retailers like Forever 21 and H&M. Forever 21 blamed the tax exemption in part for its decision to file for bankruptcy last month and close its U.S. stores,\n\n\"We have been unable to find a sustainable path forward, given competition from foreign fast-fashion companies, which have been able to take advantage of the de minimis exemption to undercut our brand on pricing and margin,\" Chief Financial Officer Brad Sell said in a statement.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon launched late last year a low- cost online storefront featuring electronics, apparel and other products priced under $20, in an apparent effort to compete with Temu and Shein. Amazon shipped the products to U.S. customers from a warehouse it operates in China, according to documentation the company provided to sellers.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

But Loomer during her Oval Office conversation with Trump urged the president to purge staffers she deemed insufficiently loyal to his \"Make America Great Again\" agenda, according to several people familiar with the matter.

(AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey, File)\n\nThe firings by Trump of NSC staff come at a tumultuous moment for Trump and his national security team. His national security adviser Mike Waltz, continues to fight back calls for his ouster after using the publicly available encrypted Signal app to discuss planning for the sensitive March 15 military operation targeting Houthi militants in Yemen.\n\nTrump has said he stands by Waltz, who traveled to Florida with the president on Thursday for a dinner event ahead of the LIV Golf tournament in Miami.\n\nMeanwhile, The Pentagon's acting inspector general announced Thursday that he would review Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's use of Signal to convey plans on the Houthi operations. The review will also look at other defense officials' use of the publicly available encrypted app.\n\nTrump grew frustrated when asked about the review.\n\n\"You're bringing that up again,\" Trump scoffed at a reporter. \"Don't bring that up again. Your editor's probably-that's such a wasted story.\"\n\nVice President JD Vance, chief of staff Susie Wiles, Waltz and Sergio Gor, director of the Presidential Personnel Office, also took part in the meeting with Loomer, the people said.\n\nThe Presidential Personnel Office has fired at least three senior NSC officials and multiple lower-ranking aides since Wednesday's meeting with Loomer, according to the people familiar with the situation.\n\nThe NSC officials fired include Brian Walsh, a director for intelligence; Thomas Boodry, a senior director for legislative affairs; and David Feith, a senior director for technology and national security, according two people familiar with the matter.\n\n\"Laura Loomer is a very good patriot. She is a very strong person,\" said Trump, who described his talks with the far-right activist as \"constructive.\"\n\nTrump acknowledged that Loomer \"recommended certain people for jobs.\"\n\n\"Sometimes I listen to those recommendations like I do with everybody,\" Trump said. \"I listen to everybody than I make a decision.\"\n\nLoomer, who has promoted 9/11 conspiracy theories, was a frequent presence on the campaign trail during Trump's 2024 successful White House run. More recently, she's been speaking out on social media about members of Trump's national security team that she insists can't be trusted.\n\n\"It was an honor to meet with President Trump and present him with my research findings,\" Loomer said in a Thursday posting on X. \"I will continue working hard to support his agenda, and I will continue reiterating the importance of, and the necessity of STRONG VETTING, for the sake of protecting the President of the United States of America, and our national security.\"\n\nTrump has a long history of elevating and associating with people who trade in falsehoods and conspiracy theories, and he regularly amplifies posts on his social media site shared by those like Loomer, who promotes QAnon, an apocalyptic and convoluted conspiracy theory centered on the belief that Trump is fighting the \"deep state.\"\n\nTrump's national security team has been through a difficult stretch as officials struggle to answer questions about why they were using the Signal app to discuss planning for an operation targeting Houthi militants instead of using far more secure communication means.\n\nThe use of Signal for operation planning came to light because a journalist, The Atlantic magazine's Jeffrey Goldberg, was mistakenly added to the chain and revealed that Trump's team used it to discuss precise timing of the operation, aircraft used to carry out the strikes and more.\n\nWaltz has taken responsibility for building the text chain but has said he does not know how Goldberg ended up being included.\n\nThe Pentagon's acting inspector general announced Thursday that he would review Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's use of Signal to convey plans on the Houthi operations. The review will also look at other defense officials' use of the publicly available encrypted app.\n\nLoomer, in the leadup to Wednesday's meeting with Trump, had complained to sympathetic administration officials that she had been excluded from the NSC vetting process as Waltz built his staff, according to one person familiar with the matter. She believes Waltz was too reliant in the process on \"neocons\" - shorthand for the more hawkish neoconservatives within the Republican Party - as well as what she perceived as \"not-MAGA-enough\" types, the person said.\n\nSen. Mike Rounds, a Republican who sits on Senate committees overseeing the military and national intelligence, said it \"raises eyebrows\" when \"there is a firing of people on the National Security Council or their staff, particularly people that we have respect for, who were part of the Intel community to begin with here in the Senate.\"\n\nWaltz, in the first days of Trump's return to Washington, sent about 160 nonpolitical detailees assigned to the NSC back to their home agencies to ensure those at the White House were committed to implementing Trump's America First agenda.\n\nThe move sidelined nonpolitical experts on topics that range from counterterrorism to global climate policy at a time when the United States is dealing with a disparate set of complicated foreign policy matters, including conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East .\n\nLast week, Adam Schleifer, an assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, was fired without explanation in a terse email from the White House personnel office shortly after Loomer posted about him on social media, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show the surname of The Atlantic journalist is Goldberg, not Rosenberg.\n\n___\n\nLee reported from Brussels.

Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nThe nostalgia behind the slogan \"Make America great again\" has always provoked the obvious questions of just when America was great, and for whom. Early in the second Trump administration, we are getting the answer.\n\nIn August, speaking with someone he believed to be a sympathetic donor, one of the Project 2025 architects, Russell Vought, said that a goal of the next Trump administration would be to \"get us off of multiculturalism\" in America. Now Vought is running Donald Trump's Office of Management and Budget, and the plan to end multiculturalism is proceeding apace. Much of the chaos, lawlessness, and destruction of the past few weeks can be understood as part of the administration's central ideological project: restoring America's traditional hierarchies of race and gender. Call it the \"Great Resegregation.\"\n\nFrom the January/February 2024 issue: Civil rights undone\n\nSince taking office, Trump has rescinded decades-old orders ensuring equal opportunity in government contracts and vowed to purge DEI from the federal government, intending to lay off any federal worker whose job they associate with DEI. Yesterday evening, Trump fired the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Charles Q Brown , and replaced him with a lower ranking white official, a retired three-star Air Force officer named Dan Caine. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth had previously attacked Brown as an unqualified diversity hire based on the fact that he is Black. Trump's Department of Justice has implied that it will prosecute or sue companies that engage in diversity outreach. Elon Musk's DOGE is attempting to purge federal workers \"that protect employees' civil rights and others that investigate complaints of employment discrimination in the federal workplace,\" the Washington Post reported. Colleges and universities are being threatened with defunding for any programming related to DEI, which the free-speech organization PEN America has noted could include \"everything from a panel on the Civil Rights Movement to a Lunar New Year celebration.\"\n\nTrump has also signed executive orders that threaten government funding for scientific research on inequality or on health issues that disproportionately affect nonwhite ethnic groups , and has imposed censorious gag orders that could block discussion of race or sex discrimination in American classrooms. During her confirmation hearing, Trump's education-secretary nominee, Linda McMahon, said she did not know if schools could lose funding for teaching Black-history classes under the order . The legality of the order over K-12 curricula is unclear , but the chilling effects are real nonetheless.\n\nUnder the Trump administration, schools within the Department of Defense system that serve military families-American service members are disproportionately Black and Hispanic -have torn down pictures of Black historical figures and removed books from their libraries on subjects such as race and gender. This record, within a school system entirely under the administration's control, offers an alarming preview-one in which a historical figure like Harriet Tubman is no longer a welcome subject in educational settings because she was a Black woman.\n\nAn OMB memo ordering a federal-funding freeze illustrates the ideological vision behind these decisions. The memo states that the administration seeks to prevent the use of \"federal resources to advance Marxist equity, transgenderism, and green new deal social engineering policies,\" Acting Director Matthew Vaeth wrote. Equal opportunity in employment is described here as \"Marxist,\" because it affirms what the desegregators see as an unnatural principle: that nonwhite people are equal to white people, that women are equal to men, and that LGBTQ people deserve the same rights as everyone else .\n\nIf the Great Resegregation proves successful, it will restore an America past where racial and ethnic minorities were the occasional token presence in an otherwise white-dominated landscape. It would repeal the gains of the civil-rights era in their entirety. What its advocates want is not a restoration of explicit Jim Crow segregation-that would shatter the illusion that their own achievements are based in a color-blind meritocracy. They want an arrangement that perpetuates racial inequality indefinitely while retaining some plausible deniability, a rigged system that maintains a mirage of equal opportunity while maintaining an unofficial racial hierarchy. Like elections in authoritarian countries where the autocrat is always reelected in a landslide, they want a system in which they never risk losing but can still pretend they won fairly.\n\nThe battles of the Great Resegregation are now taking place in at least three overlapping arenas. The first is politics, where right-wing legal organizations have succeeded in rolling back many civil-rights-era voting protections; they want to now fully destroy the remaining shreds. The second is education and employment, particularly at elite institutions, such as the media and academia; right-wing legal strategies have been similarly fruitful here in attacking diversity, thanks to the conservative capture of the Supreme Court. The third is popular culture, where conservatives have sought to leverage anger and nostalgia against movies, television, books, and other creative media brought to life by artists of color.\n\nThe term DEI , frequently invoked by the Trump administration, functions as a smoke screen. It allows people to think that the Trump administration's anti-DEI purge is about removing pointless corporate symbolism or sensitivity trainings. Although it is easy to find examples of DEI efforts that are ill-conceived or ill-applied, some conservatives have leveraged those criticisms to pursue a much broader agenda that is really about tearing anti-discrimination laws out at the roots, so that businesses and governments are free to extend or deny opportunities based on race, gender, and sexual orientation if they so choose.\n\n\"This is really taking us back to a kind of pre-civil-rights-movement vision of America,\" Sherrilyn Ifill, the former head of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, told me in an interview last year, before Trump won the 2024 election. \"A backlash is a pushback. This is really much more of a demolition effort.\"\n\nAs the Trump State Department official Darren Beattie wrote, \"Competent white men must be put in charge if you want things to work. Unfortunately, our entire national ideology is predicated on coddling the feelings of women and minorities, and demoralizing competent white men.\" This analysis is perceptive in the sense that the exact reverse is true-we are now in the second decade of a years-long temper tantrum sparked by the election of Barack Obama-not to mention the failed attempts to elect a woman to succeed him-and the effect it had on the fragile self-esteem of people like Beattie.\n\nRead: Is there anything Trump won't blame on DEI?\n\nOther MAGA figureheads have promoted similar ideas. In 2020, the conservative writer Christopher Caldwell published a book arguing that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 had revoked \"the de jure constitution of 1788, with all the traditional forms of jurisprudential legitimacy and centuries of American culture behind it.\" Because of the Civil Rights Act, white people had fallen \"asleep thinking of themselves as the people who had built this country and woke up to find themselves occupying the bottom rung of an official hierarchy of races.\"\n\nCaldwell's assessment has grown in popularity among prominent conservatives. The right-wing activist Charlie Kirk has described the Civil Rights Act as having \"created a beast, and that beast has now turned into an anti-white weapon,\" and he has attacked Martin Luther King Jr., Wired reported , as part of a \"broader strategy to discredit\" King and \"the Civil Rights Act.\" On his social network, X, the South African-born Musk, who is playing a key role in the Trump administration, regularly promotes scientific racism , the pseudoscientific ideology that holds that race determines individual potential. Some of the staffers Musk has hired to dismantle the enforcement of anti-discrimination laws seem to share those ideological predilections . One DOGE staffer resigned after the Wall Street Journal revealed he maintained a pro-eugenics social media account where \"he appeared to have a special dislike for Indian software engineers.\" He was reinstated after receiving public support from Trump and J. D. Vance.  The problem conservatives trying to undermine anti-discrimination law seem to have with an \"official hierarchy of races\" is not that one exists but that, in their warped conception, white people are not on top, as they should be.\n\nThis ideology is apparent in the rote blaming of diversity by some conservatives for every catastrophic event-as they did following a midair collision over the Potomac River. Or a freighter crashing into a bridge in Baltimore . Or doors flying off Boeing planes .The contention, overt or implied, is always that unlike white men, whose competence can be assumed, the non-white people with desirable jobs are undeserving. The irony, of course, is that many of the white men making these assumptions are themselves unqualified. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is best-known for being a reality-television star .\n\nEven so, the Great Resegregation seeks not a return to the explicit racial separation of Jim Crow, but rather an embrace of ostensibly \"color-blind\" policies intended to sustain a de facto segregation that is more durable and less overt, one in which Black access to the middle and elite strata of American life will be ever more rare and fleeting. The numbers of Black doctors, lawyers, scientists, architects, showrunners, and generals would no longer rise. And there would be no more Black presidents. The real but fragile advancement of the Black poor into the Black middle class would be stalled or reversed. Most Black people would be confined to, as Trump memorably put it, the menial \"Black jobs\" they were meant for, save for those willing to sustain the self-serving fiction that they are among the good ones.\n\nThe demolition of multiracial democracy began a dozen years ago, when the Supreme Court's conservative majority rolled back voting-rights protections adopted in the 1960s to enforce the rights enshrined in the Fifteenth Amendment. Those protections made America, for the first time, a democracy for all its citizens. They diversified Congress , and led to the election of the first Black president. The Roberts Court has steadily eroded those protections, insisting that they are no longer necessary, even as racist ideas once considered beyond the pale return to the mainstream. These changes have had the predictable outcome of increasing racial disparities in voting.\n\nThe Roberts Court has treated policies meant to rectify racial discrimination as themselves racist. The Court shut down what remained of public-school integration efforts. It overturned affirmative action in higher education. These decisions have eroded diversity in the classroom. But they're just the beginning for the resegregators, who intend to ensure that America's traditional racial hierarchies are persistent and stable.\n\nOne clear example comes in the world of higher education. Because giving all Americans equal access to elite higher education is a step toward broader societal integration, such efforts must be shut down. To this end, conservative groups are suing colleges even in states such as California , where affirmative action in public universities has long been banned, claiming that the fact that their incoming classes have become more diverse rather than less is evidence of reverse discrimination. At least two conservative justices have objected to color-blind, class-based affirmative-action programs . This approach suggests a topsy-turvy understanding of racial discrimination, in which a diverse classroom is one in which white men have been discriminated against, based on the conviction that white men are by definition the most competent possible candidates.\n\nRead: Donald Trump is very busy\n\nWhen Trump officials speak of a society that is color-blind and merit-based , they do not appear to mean meritocracy or color-blindness in the traditional sense. Instead of individual meritocracy, they seem to be advocating a racial meritocracy, in which the merit of an individual hire or admission can be assessed not by their individual accomplishments but by how well the group they are associated with fits a particular role. In this way, the Great Resegregation seeks firmer moral ground than the racial apartheid of the past. Racial disparities can be framed not as the result of discrimination, but as a fact: that white people are just better and more qualified. And by withholding federal funding from places that engage in scientific inquiry on social inequalities or offer historical instruction that could be seen as portraying America as \"fundamentally racist, sexist, or otherwise discriminatory,\" the Trump administration can make the causes of those inequalities illegible.\n\nWhat the proponents of the Great Resegregation seek is a counterrevolution not merely in law, but also in culture. The civil-rights revolution of the 1960s changed hearts and minds as well as laws, and one of those changes was that racially exclusive institutions became morally suspect. Notably, Trump officials are not willing to state their aims explicitly; they feel obligated to pay lip service to ideals of color-blind meritocracy and mislead about their intentions.\n\n\"My view is that the diversity ethos has really sunk deep roots,\" the Harvard Law professor Randall Kennedy told me. \"There are a lot of people across a wide variety of ideological positions who would not like a racially homogeneous, all-white outfit. Even people who say they're against affirmative action, they would feel somewhat nervous or somewhat embarrassed or somewhat guilty about that.\" Trumpists seek to not just repeal protections against discrimination, but reverse the \"diversity ethos\" that has enabled America's tenuous strides toward equality.\n\nAnd that progress is not only fragile but remarkably incomplete. Neither schools nor workplaces have ever been particularly integrated. Public-school integration stalled long ago . Even prior to the Supreme Court's decision outlawing affirmative action in admissions, enrollment of Black and Hispanic students at elite universities had stalled at percentages far below their share of the student-age population . Occupational segregation has remained stagnant since the '90s. Black workers with or without college degrees are concentrated in professions that pay less than those of their white counterparts, despite a rise in Black people obtaining college degrees. Corporate DEI efforts never made much progress on integration to begin with, in part because many of these efforts were more about branding and limiting liability than equal opportunity, and now the federal government will be dead set on reversing whatever headway was made.\n\n\"The segregation we see in the labor market right now is three to five times worse than we would expect if race wasn't a core factor,\" Justin Heck of Opportunity@Work, an organization that advocates for workers without college degrees, told me. \"We've seen it go down a little bit in the years leading up to 1990. But the current world looks the same as it did in 1990. It's been stagnant or worse, or slightly worse today.\" Heck is one of the authors of a 2023 study on occupational segregation published by the National Bureau of Economic Research.\n\nThere are perhaps two exceptions. One is the federal government , where until now, anti-discrimination laws have been strictly enforced. Trump's cronies have tried to discredit the federal workforce precisely because it is often more meritocratic, and therefore more integrated than the private sector. \"It's harder in a federal-government job to get a position simply through an informal network,\" the political scientist Ashley Jardina, who also worked on the NBER study, told me. \"Whereas in the private sector, especially in building trades, for example, a lot of people are getting their jobs through their social networks, which are incredibly segregated.\"\n\nThat is why Trumpists are so focused on \"ending DEI\" in the federal workforce. They see anti-discrimination and inclusion as a ladder of upward mobility for people they do not believe should have one. Under Trump, a workplace or college that is perceived as too diverse might come under legal scrutiny, effectively enforcing racial quotas. For example, Andrew Bailey, the attorney general of Missouri, is suing the coffee chain Starbucks on the basis that after adopting DEI programs its workforce has become \"more female and less white.\"\n\nThe second place where America has grown more integrated is media and entertainment, arenas highly visible to the public. This has depreciated the value of what W. E. B. Du Bois called the \"psychological wage\" of white racial identity-making those who once held an unquestioned hegemony over American culture feel like something has been stolen from them. And this shift helped fuel the nationwide backlash to diversity efforts that Trump rode to office.\n\nW. E. B. Du Bois: Strivings of the Negro people\n\nThe slight but substantive integration of characters in film , television , and other forms of entertainment has itself led to a visible backlash, subjecting actors, writers, and other creative workers of color to harassment whenever they participate in a high-profile project, especially in the genres of science fiction or fantasy. An integrated cast, writers' room, or development team is deemed \"woke,\" by which critics simply mean integrated, and therefore suspect. A woman, LGBTQ person, or person of color in a leading role is deemed unqualified, or worthy of rejection just because of who they are. What may seem like silly internet controversies are in fact demands for a resegregation of creative workplaces.\n\n\"I think probably part of why we observe more integration in some spaces and others also just has a lot to do with the demands that capitalism places on having a market,\" Jardina told me. \"It earns money for media organizations and studios to diversify their shows and their casts, because there's a market for that, in the same way that there isn't in a lot of industries.\"\n\nIn other words, the exceptions to America's persistent segregation have taken place in America's most public-facing professions, among those assigned to interpret the world around them. What people consuming American media see, for the most part, is a mirage of a more integrated America that has yet to come into being. In virtually every other arena-the private-sector workplace, housing , schooling -America remains profoundly segregated, with opportunities limited by class and race.\n\nThis is why Trump's funding freeze has targeted DEI despite no evidence that the government has lowered its standards on behalf of women and minorities . Asked to provide a real example of lowered standards in the military during his confirmation hearings, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was unable to. The U.S. military has long led the way in demonstrating how a diverse workforce yields American excellence-one reason some conservatives are fixated on its relative egalitarianism, which they deride as \"wokeness.\" Hegseth recently said he believed that \"the single dumbest phrase in military history is our diversity is our strength.\" The Nazis and Confederates learned otherwise.\n\nOf course he himself is an illustration of lowered standards -Hegseth has no demonstrable expertise for the job he was given-but because he is a white man, his qualifications for the job are assumed, as a result of the Trumpist concept of racial meritocracy. This is why the funding freeze is targeting research on inequality . It is why private companies are threatened with government lawsuits and prosecutions if they seek a broader pool of applicants. It is why the Trump administration's deportations do not target merely undocumented criminals but also immigrants on Temporary Protective Status . It is why Trump's loyalists are dismantling any and all government programs that might conceivably even the playing field between those born with plenty and those born with little.\n\nFor all the big talk about putting an end to \"social engineering,\" the Great Resegregation is itself a radical attempt to socially engineer America to be poorer, whiter, less equal, and less democratic. Much as the old Jim Crow measures kept many southern white people impoverished and disenfranchised alongside the Black southerners they targeted, the Great Resegregation will leave wealthy white elites with a firmer grip on power and the working classes with fewer opportunities and a weakened social safety net. The only people left with more will be those who already had more than they needed to begin with."

      "text": "The Most Revealing Moment of a Trump Rally\n\nA close reading of the prayers delivered before the former president speaks\n\nListen to more stories on curio\n\nSign up for The Decision , a newsletter featuring our 2024 election coverage.\n\nA week before Christmas , an evangelical minister named Paul Terry stood before thousands of Christians, their heads bowed, in Durham, New Hampshire, and pleaded with God for deliverance. The nation was in crisis, he told the Lord-racked with death and addiction, led by wicked men who \"rule with imperial disdain.\"\n\n\"With every passing day,\" the minister said , \"we slip farther and farther into George Orwell's tyrannical dystopia.\"\n\nCheck out more from this issue and find your next story to read.\n\nBut because God is merciful, there was reason for hope. One man stood ready to redeem the country: Donald Trump. And he was about to come onstage. \"We know what he did for us and how he strove to lead us in honorable ways during his term as our president-in ways that brought your blessings to us, rather than your reproach and judgment,\" Terry prayed. \"We know the hour is late. We know that time grows shorter for us to be saved and revived.\" When he finished in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen s echoed through the hall. Soon Trump appeared to rapturous applause and Lee Greenwood's \"God Bless the U.S.A.\"\n\nFor all the exhaustive coverage of Trump's campaign rallies, even before the assassination attempt at one of them in July , relatively little attention has been paid to the prayers that start each one. These invocations aren't broadcast live on cable news, nor do they typically attract the interest of journalists, who gravitate toward the more impious utterances of the candidate himself. But the prayers offered before Trump speaks illuminate this perilous moment in American politics just as well as anything he says from the podium. And they help explain how the stakes of this year's election have come to feel so apocalyptically high.\n\nFrom the January/February 2024 issue: If Trump wins\n\nTo understand the evolving psychology and beliefs of Trump's religious supporters, I attempted to review every prayer offered at his campaign events since he announced in November 2022 that he would run again. Working with a researcher, I compiled 58 in total, the most recent from June 2024. The resulting document-at just over 17,000 words-makes for a strange, revealing religious text: benign in some places, blasphemous in others; contradictory and poignant and frightening and sad and, perhaps most of all, begging for exegesis.\n\nThere are many ways to parse the text. You could compare the number of times Trump's name is mentioned (87) versus Jesus Christ's (61). You could break down the demographics of the people leading the prayers: 45 men and 13 women; overwhelmingly evangelical, with disproportionate representation from Pentecostalism , a charismatic branch of Christianity that emphasizes supernatural faith healing and speaking in tongues. One might also be tempted to catalog the most comically incendiary lines (\"Oh Lord, our Lord, we want to be awake and not woke\"). But the most interesting way to look at these prayers is to examine the theological motifs that run through them.\n\nThe scripture verse that's cited most frequently in the prayers comes from 2 Chronicles. \"If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land.\"\n\nRyan Burge, a Baptist minister and political scientist I asked to review the prayers, told me that this verse-which is quoted 10 times-is regularly cited by evangelicals to advance a popular conservative-Christian narrative: that America, like ancient Israel before it, has broken its special covenant with God and is suffering the consequences. \"The Old Testament prophets they're quoting talk about sin collectively instead of individually-the nation has fallen into wickedness and needs healing,\" Burge said. \"The way they use this verse presupposes that we're spiraling down the tubes.\"\n\nTrump's supporters attribute America's fall from grace to a variety of national sins old and new-prayer bans in public schools, illegal immigration, pro-transgender policies, the purported rigging of a certain recent election. Whatever the specifics, the picture of America they paint is almost universally-biblically-bleak.\n\nIn Wildwood, New Jersey, a pastor declared, \"Our nation finds itself in turmoil, chaos, and dysfunction.\" In Fort Dodge, Iowa, the sentiment was similar: \"Lies, corruption, and propaganda are driving civilization to ruins.\" In Conway, South Carolina, one supplicant informed God, \"Our enemies are trying to steal, kill, and destroy our America, so we need you to intervene.\"\n\nRead: You should go to a Trump rally\n\nThe premise of all of these prayers is that America's covenant can be reestablished, and its special place in God's kingdom restored, if the nation repents and turns back to him. Burge told me that these ideas have long percolated on the religious right. What's new is how many Christians now seem convinced that God has anointed a specific leader who, like those prophets of old, is prepared to defeat the forces of evil and redeem the country. And that leader is running for president.\n\nEarly on in the Trump era, it was common to hear conservative Christians compare him to Cyrus the Great , the sixth-century-B.C.E. Persian king who, though he did not worship the God of Israel himself, liberated the Israelites from Babylonian captivity and helped them build their temple in Jerusalem.\n\nThe subtext was not subtle. Here was a handy biblical precedent for the \"unlikely vessel\"-the man God uses to fulfill his purposes even though he lacks the faith and character of a true believer.\n\nBut this analogy seems to have outlived its usefulness to the religious right: A 2020 Pew Research Center survey found that 62 percent of Republicans viewed Trump as \"morally upstanding,\" and in a Deseret News poll commissioned last year, 64 percent said they believed he is a \"person of faith.\" The former president no longer needs to be described as a blunt, utilitarian tool in God's hand. \"Cyrus was a way of acknowledging, 'I know this is an immoral person, but he could still do some good,' \" Russell Moore, an evangelical theologian and the editor of Christianity Today , who has been critical of Trump, told me. \"I haven't heard Cyrus language in at least five years.\"\n\nThe prayers at Trump's rallies reflect this shifting perception. Cyrus isn't mentioned, but Trump does get compared to righteous, prophetic heroes of the Bible, including Esther, Solomon, and David.\n\nIn America, more than perhaps anywhere else in the Western world, petitions to God are still a routine fixture of politics-at congressional sessions, presidential nominating conventions, inaugurations. After a gunman shot at Trump during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July, both Democrats and Republicans prayed for the former president and for the country he hopes to lead.\n\nAnd many presidential campaigns are infused with religion. In July, Joe Biden attended a church service in Philadelphia where the pastor compared the president's recent political struggles to the Old Testament story of Joseph, and a member of the congregation prayed for Biden: \"Touch his mind, O God, his body; rejuvenate him and his spirit.\"\n\nBradley Onishi, a scholar and former evangelical minister who studies the intersection of politics and Christianity in America, told me that prayers at political events have traditionally fit a certain mold. God is asked to grant the political leader inspiration and wisdom, to help him resist temptation and lead the country in a righteous direction. \"It was always 'We pray for him to have the strength to do God's will, to have character, to be the man we need,' \" Onishi said.\n\nSome of the prayers at Trump's rallies run along these lines, and would be familiar to anyone who has spent time in an American church, myself included. \"Give President Trump the strength to make the right decisions both in and out of the public eye,\" one man prayed at a Trump event in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. \"Remind him to seek your guidance as events unfold.\" I have said \"Amen\" to a thousand prayers like this in my life, on behalf of government leaders in both parties.\n\nBut Onishi, like several of the other experts I asked to read the prayers, was struck by how many of them take Trump's righteousness for granted. \"No one prays for Trump to do right; they pray that God will do right by Trump,\" Onishi told me.\n\nIndeed, rather than asking God to make Trump an instrument of his will, most of the prayers start from the assumption that he already is. Accordingly, many of them drop any pretense of thy-will-be-done nonpartisanship, and ask explicitly for Trump's reelection. \"Lord, you have a servant in Donald J. Trump, who can lead our nation,\" a woman offering a prayer in Laconia, New Hampshire, told God at a rally on the eve of the state's Republican primary. \"Help us to overcome any obstacles tomorrow so that we may deliver victory to your warrior.\"\n\nFrom the April 2018 issue: Trump and the evangelical temptation\n\nWith Trump's goodness presumed, the criminal charges against him are cast not as evidence of potential wrongdoing but as a sign of victimhood. \"We ask that you put a hedge of protection around President Trump,\" one woman prayed in Waukesha, Wisconsin, \"and deliver him from the baseless attacks, and remove from office those who are subverting justice in our legal system.\"\n\nAt a February campaign event in North Charleston, South Carolina, Mark Burns, a televangelist in a three-piece suit, squeezed his eyes shut and lifted his right hand toward heaven . \"Let us pray, because we're fighting a demonic force,\" he shouted. \"We're fighting the real enemy that comes from the gates of hell, led by one of its leaders called Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.\"\n\nAlthough Burns was more provocative than most, he was not alone in using the language of spiritual warfare . This is perhaps the most unnerving theme in the prayers at Trump's rallies. One verse, from Ephesians, is quoted repeatedly: \"For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.\"\n\nRussell Moore told me he used to hear conservative evangelicals cite this verse as a way of shifting the focus away from earthly concerns like politics and toward the larger, more important battle for our souls. \"The point would be that our opponents aren't our enemies,\" he told me. But something has changed in recent years. \"That's not the implication I see in these prayers. It's 'Politics is how we fight these spiritual battles.' \"\n\nRussell Moore: The American evangelical Church is in crisis. There's only one way out.\n\nTerry Amann, a conservative pastor in Iowa, told me I shouldn't be surprised to hear such a dire framing of the election. Christians like him see abortion as a grave sin and fast-changing social mores around gender and sexuality as serious threats to the nation's spiritual health. \"Every election cycle, they say this is the most important election in your lifetime,\" he told me. To him, it feels like this one really is. \"Our republic is in trouble.\"\n\nBut it's easy to see the danger in internalizing the concept of politics as spiritual combat. Trump's rallies become more than mere campaign events-they are staging grounds in a supernatural conflict that pits literal angels against literal demons for the soul of the nation. Marinate enough in these ideas, and the consequences of defeat start to feel existential. \"This is not a time for politics as usual,\" a Pentecostal preacher declared at a Trump rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, last year. \"It's not a time for religion as usual. It's not a time for prayers as usual. This is a time for spiritual warriors to arise and to shake the heavens.\"\n\nAs I was reviewing these prayers, I wondered what Trump's most zealous religious supporters would do if they didn't get the result they were praying for in November. With so much riding on the idea that Trump's reelection has a divine mandate, what would happen if he lost? A destabilizing crisis of faith? Another widespread rejection of the election's outcome? Further spasms of political violence ?\n\nIt wasn't until I came across a prayer delivered in December in Coralville, Iowa, that a more urgent question occurred to me: What will they do if their prayers are answered?\n\nOnstage, Joel Tenney, a 27-year-old evangelist with a shiny coif of blond hair and a quavering preacher's cadence, preceded his prayer with a short sermon for the gathered crowd of Trump supporters. \"We have witnessed a sitting president weaponize the entire legal system to try and steal an election and imprison his leading opponent, Donald Trump, despite committing no crime,\" Tenney began. \"The corruption in Washington is a natural reflection of the spiritual state of our nation.\"\n\nFor the next several minutes, Tenney hit all the familiar notes: He quoted from 2 Chronicles and Ephesians, and reminded the audience of the eternal consequences of 2024. Then he issued a warning to those who would stand in the way of God's will being done on Election Day.\n\nFrom the January/February 2024 issue: My father, my faith, and Donald Trump\n\n\"Be afraid,\" Tenney said. \"For rulers do not bear the sword for no reason. They are God's servants of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer. And when Donald Trump becomes the 47th president of the United States, there will be retribution against all those who have promoted evil in this country.\"\n\nWith that, he invited the audience to remove their hats, and turned his voice to God. \"Lord, help us make America great again,\" he prayed.\n\nThis article appears in the September 2024 print edition with the headline \"'Lord, Help Us Make America Great Again.'\""

      "text": "Democrats Search for Their Own 'Make America Great Again'\n\nTop candidates such as Elizabeth Warren tried to avoid wonky policy proposals and focus on big, sweeping messages last night.\n\nIn more than two sprawling hours of serial discussion that sometimes even came close to \"debate\" last night, 10 Democratic contenders for president-and the time-obsessed moderators who questioned them-served up a vivid contrast between the micro and the macro in American politics. It was a display of the difference between the specific policy proposals that connote a respectable résumé (or that contain a potential time bomb) and the big, animating ideas that tend to win elections-whether that message is \"Yes we can\" or \"Make America great again.\"\n\nCNN's Jake Tapper played prosecuting attorney. From the start, he peppered the candidates with gotcha questions on whether they'd support raising this particular tax to pay for that particular program, then cut them off if the network's debate ground rules (or a producer's voice in his ear) meant it was time to move on. Undeterred, several of the candidates fought to prove their bona fides with wonk-speak and inside political baseball.\n\nFormer Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas bragged about shaking up the Veterans Affairs branch in his hometown of El Paso. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg spoke of amending his police department's policy on use of force. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota assured the 3,500 people in Detroit's Fox Theatre and the millions watching at home that she could win \"in the red districts\" and carry the Midwest. Former Representative John Delaney of Maryland, a self-made millionaire who last night enjoyed by far the most exposure of his long-running but little-noticed campaign, denounced his liberal rivals for offering \"free everything\" and \"impossible promises,\" and vowed that he'd never be like those past losers George McGovern, Walter Mondale, and Michael Dukakis.\n\nBut it may have been two candidates from divergent sides of the ideological spectrum-Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Montana Governor Steve Bullock-who most often soared above the small-arms fire. Warren, who has been both mocked and praised for her plethora of specific policy proposals and plans-truly in the weeds-chose last night to fly mostly at 35,000 feet.\n\nDavid A. Graham: Elizabeth Warren's big night\n\n\"Democrats win when we figure out what is right and we get out there and fight for it,\" Warren told Tapper when he reminded her that Democratic voters have told pollsters they'd prefer a candidate who can beat President Donald Trump to one they agree with ideologically. \"I am not afraid. And for Democrats to win, you can't be afraid either.\" At another point in the night, when Delaney pooh-poohed her support for ideas such as Medicare for All and decriminalizing illegal border crossings, Warren lowered the boom with a withering put-down: \"I don't know why anybody goes to all the trouble of running for president of the United States just to talk about what we can't do and shouldn't fight for.\" And down went Frazier.\n\nNo one asked Warren, in so many words, just what she would do to, ahem, make America great again, but over and over, her answers amounted to an emphatic, unambiguous response to that question all the same. More than most of her rivals, Warren seemed to acknowledge that Trump won office in 2016 with a brutally simple macro message-one that easily fits on the front of a baseball cap, and one that, for all its sinister and cynical undertones, was at least partly aspirational for millions of voters.\n\nBullock, making his debut on the national debate stage after failing to qualify for the first round, in Miami last month, attempted to hit similarly inspirational notes. \"I come from a state where a lot of people voted for Donald Trump,\" he said in his opening statement. \"Let's not kid ourselves: He will be hard to beat. Yet watching that last debate, folks seem more concerned about scoring points or outdoing each other with wish-list economics than making sure Americans know we hear their voices and will help their lives. Look, I'm a pro-choice, pro-union Democrat that won three elections in a red state, not by compromising our values but by getting stuff done. That's how we win back the places we lost: showing up, listening, focusing on the challenges of everyday Americans. That farmer getting hit right now by Trump's trade wars, that teacher working a second job just to afford her insulin-they can't wait for a revolution. Their problems are in the here and now. I'm a progressive-emphasis on progress -and I'm running for president to get stuff done for all those Americans Washington has left behind.\"\n\nCompare that with Buttigieg's proposals to abolish the Electoral College, pack the Supreme Court, and grant statehood to the District of Columbia-a constitutionally pie-in-the sky set of plans that may be worthy of serious study and academic debate, but that has as much practical chance of imminent passage as an icicle's chance in Indonesia. Or compare Bullock's words with Klobuchar's dogged support of a \"public option\" for health insurance in lieu of Medicare for All. Or with John Hickenlooper's pride in signing a law requiring universal background checks for gun owners in Colorado. Those may be worthy ideas (or not), but they don't add up to a cohesive, compelling message. Especially not in the fractured, hopscotching format of these particular encounters. Politicians may have to govern in prose, in Mario Cuomo's famous formulation, but the historical bipartisan reality is that they still do best when they campaign in poetry-whether that's promising a \"kinder, gentler\" nation, \"compassionate conservatism,\" \"putting people first,\" or that \"yes we can.\"\n\nMarianne Williamson, the New Age author and spiritual adviser, understands this truth. She distilled her differences with Trump-and with the rest of the more \"conventional\" Democrats onstage-in a plainspoken (albeit florid) sound bite that an expert in political communications might have envied. \"Our problem is not just that we need to defeat Trump,\" Williamson said in her closing statement. \"We need a plan to solve institutionalized hatred, collectivized hatred, and white nationalism. And in order to do that, we need more than political-insider game and wonkiness and intellectual argument. Those things will not defeat Donald Trump. We need some radical truth-telling, not just to talk about health care, but talk about why are we so sick all the time. We need to have a serious conversation about race and what is truly owed. Even on the subject of foreign policy, it's all about symptoms and not about cause. We need to talk about the fact that the United States has sacrificed its moral leadership.\"\n\nRead: Democrats make the case that they're the moral party\n\nWarren, a former law professor, left no doubt as to the thesis of her lecture last night. She displayed a fluid ability to code-shift from granular enumeration of her policies to high-level, aspirational explanations about why her ideas matter in real life. She took advantage of her top-tier status with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont as the voice of the party's progressive wing and chose not to quarrel with him-indeed, they never really disagreed all night-but to broaden her message and appeal.\n\nIn his own closing statement, Bullock recalled that growing up in Helena, Montana's capital, he only knew there was a governor's house in town \"because I delivered newspapers to it.\"\n\n\"I made it about four blocks in life,\" he said, before recounting how he worked his way through college and law school so that he had the chance to go from delivering papers to the governor's house to raising his own three kids in it. \"We have to recognize, for too many people in America, that shot no longer exists,\" Bullock said. \"For far too many in the country, it never has. I'm running for president to beat Donald Trump, win back the places lost, and make sure that Americans know that where Washington left them behind in the economy and political system, I'll be there.\"\n\nBullock's campaign is just getting started, but his unself-conscious invocation of the ghost of Tom Joad-\" I'll be there \"-was the kind of line that might have legs. So was his sticking up for hardworking, everyday Americans whose dirty jobs mean they have to \"shower at the end of the day.\"\n\nWarren's potential political vulnerabilities-her age, her gender, her progressivism, her claim to Native American heritage, her you-name-it-if-you-don't-like-her-are obvious enough. But last night, in front of perhaps her biggest televised audience yet, her strengths shone just as apparently.\n\n\"Right now, for decades, we have had a government that's been on the side of the rich and the powerful,\" Warren said in her closing statement. \"It has been on the side of the wealthy. And that means it hasn't been on the side of everyone else. Not on the side of people living on the Native American reservations, people living in inner cities, in small farms, and small communities across the country. How do we beat it? We beat it by being the party of big, structural change. Give people a reason to show up and vote.\"\n\nThe road ahead is long and winding. But at the end of the day on November 3, 2020, voter turnout is all that will really matter, isn't it?"

      "text": "Make America White Again?\n\nDonald Trump's language is eerily similar to the 1920s Ku Klux Klan-hypernationalistic and anti-immigrant.\n\nLast weekend, Saturday Night Live produced a mock \" Voters for Trump \" ad, in which everyday \"real Americans\" gently describe why they support Donald Trump for president-before they are all revealed to be white supremacists, Klan members, and Nazis. Trump, of course, not only received former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke's support for his candidacy, but also declined to disavow the Ku Klux Klan on CNN.\n\nThis has happened before. As The Atlantic 's Yoni Appelbaum pointed out , the Republican front-runner's refusal to repudiate white supremacists' support as well as the bombast in his campaign are both echoes of the Ku Klux Klan. As a historian of the 1920s Klan, I noticed the resonances, too. Trump's \"Make America great again\" language is just like the rhetoric of the Klan, with their emphasis on virulent patriotism and restrictive immigration. But maybe Trump doesn't know much about the second incarnation of the order and what Klansmen and Klanswomen stood for. Maybe the echoes are coincidence, not strategy to win the support of white supremacists. Maybe Trump just needs a quick historical primer on the 1920s Klan-and their vision for making America great again.\n\nIn 1915, William J. Simmons, an ex-minister and self-described joiner of fraternities, created a new Ku Klux Klan dedicated to \"100 percent Americanism\" and white Protestantism. He wanted to evoke the previous Reconstruction Klan (1866-1871) but refashion it as a new order-stripped of vigilantism and dressed in Christian virtue and patriotic pride. Simmons's Klan was to be the savior of a nation in peril, a means to reestablish the cultural dominance of white people. Immigration and the enfranchisement of African Americans, according to the Klan, eroded this dominance and meant that America was no longer great. Simmons, the first imperial wizard of the Klan, and his successor, H.W. Evans, wanted Klansmen to return the nation to its former glory. Their messages of white supremacy, Protestant Christianity, and hypernationalism found an eager audience. By 1924, the Klan claimed 4 million members; they wore robes, lit crosses on fire, read Klan newspapers, and participated in political campaigns on the local and national levels.\n\nTo save the nation, the Klan focused on accomplishing a series of goals. A 1924 Klan cartoon, \"Under the Fiery Cross,\" illustrated those goals: restricted immigration, militant Protestantism, better government, clean politics, \"back to the Constitution,\" law enforcement, and \"greater allegiance to the flag.\" Along with the emphases on government and nationalism, the order also mobilized under the banners of vulnerable white womanhood and white superiority more generally. Nativism, writes historian Matthew Frye Jacobson in Whiteness of a Different Color , is a crisis about the boundaries of whiteness and who exactly can be considered white. It is a reaction to a shift in demographics, which confuses the dominant group's understanding of race. For the KKK, Americans were supposed to be only white and Protestant. They championed white supremacy to keep the nation white, ignoring that citizenry was not constrained to their whims.\n\nThe Klan was facing a crisis because the culture was changing around them, and nativism was their reaction. Demographic shifts, including immigration, urbanization, and the migrations of African Americans from the South to the North gave urgency and legitimacy to the Klan's fears that the nation was in danger. From 1890 to 1914, more than 16 million immigrants arrived in the United States, and a large majority were Catholics from Germany, Ireland, Italy, and Poland. Around 10 percent were Jewish. The Klan described the influx of immigrants as a \"menace\" that threatened \"true Americanism,\" \"devotion to the nation and its government,\" and, worst of all, America as a civilization. Evans claimed that \"aliens\" (immigrants) challenged and attacked white Americans instead of doing the right thing-and joining the Klan's cause. (Yes, strangely, he expected immigrants' support even though the Klan limited membership to white Protestant men and women. Of course, it's also strange that Trump expects Latino support.) Writing in the Klan newspaper The Imperial Night-Hawk in 1923, Evans declared that immigrants were \"mostly scum,\" a dangerous \"horde.\"\n\nUnsurprisingly, the 1920s Klan supported legislation to restrict immigration to preferred countries with Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian roots. The order championed the Immigration Act of 1924 , which limited immigration visas to 2 percent or 3 percent of the population of each nationality from the 1890 census. When President Calvin Coolidge signed the bill into law, the Klan celebrated the continued protection of the \"purity\" of American citizenship. A white Protestant citizenry and the desire to maintain their dominance culturally and politically, then, defined 100 percent Americanism.\n\nTheir rhetoric and dramatic displays of robes and burning crosses appealed in the 1920s. White men and women turned to the Klan for reassurance that America was a nation founded by white people for white people. The Imperial Night-Hawk crafted histories absent of native peoples, African Americans, Catholics, and Jews that confirmed what readers wanted to hear: White Protestants were the creators of America, and the nation would only succeed with their continued dominance. The Klan made enemies of immigrants but also of any people they considered \"foreign\" who already resided on American soil. Threats appeared everywhere, from newly arrived immigrants to Catholics, Jews, and African Americans who were already citizens-though the order wasn't of the opinion that they should be.\n\nMaking America great required exclusion, intolerance, and vitriol. Unfortunately for the Klan, their message of 100 percent Americanism started losing ground by the end of the 1920s. Public scandals involving Klan leaders and convictions of Klansmen for murder made white Americans reconsider their allegiance to the order and its increasingly tarnished ideals. The Klan started to appear too extreme and dangerous for even the slightest association. Their steep rise was tempered by an equally steep fall. Moreover, the Klan developed an image problem: their persistent association with racism-which continues to plague the modern Klans despite efforts to rebrand their image to reflect the love of the white race, not racism per se.\n\nThe Klan's message of 100 percent Americanism and restrictive immigration resonated in the 1920s, and their message gains traction again and again every time white Americans encounter social change and shifting demographics. With a black president, LGBT equality, an enormous Hispanic community, and predictions that America will soon be a majority minority country, their message resonates now, too. That's why a former Klan leader is encouraging other white supremacists to vote for Trump and why The New Yorker 's Evan Osnos found that extremist white-rights groups also plan to vote for him. Maybe Trump doesn't know better. Or maybe the echoes are less like echoes and more like the purposeful conjuring of a racialized message-one that too many white voters still want to hear."

      "text": "Trump's Campaign Has Lost Whatever Substance It Once Had\n\nThere's no 2024 equivalent of \"Build the wall\" or \"Lock her up.\"\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nSign up for The Decision , a newsletter featuring our 2024 election coverage.\n\nDonald Trump's 2016 campaign was, among other things, one of the most impressive displays of branding on a large scale, in a short time, ever. There were hats. There were flags. And above all, there were slogans.\n\n\"Make America Great Again.\" \"Build the wall.\" \"Lock her up.\" And later, \"Drain the swamp,\" which Trump conceded on the stump that he'd initially hated. No matter: Crowds loved it, which was good enough for Trump to decide that he did, too.\n\nOne peculiarity of Trump's 2024 campaign is the absence of any similar mantra. At some recent rallies, neither Trump nor the audience has even uttered \"Build the wall,\" once a standard. Crowds are reverting instead to generic \"U-S-A\" chants or, as at a recent Phoenix rally, \" Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit! ,\" which has a winning simplicity but doesn't have the specificity and originality of its predecessors.\n\nIn their place, Trump's stump speech has become dominated by grievances about the wrongs he believes have been done to him and his promises to get even for them. It doesn't quite create the festive atmosphere of eight years ago, when many attendees were clearly having a great time. Where the new, more prosaic feeling lacks the uplift of the past, though, it has still managed to generate enough enthusiasm that Trump leads in many polls and could return to the White House in a few months.\n\nRead: Why Trump invokes 'common sense'\n\nEven Trump seems to acknowledge the hollowness of his latest run. \"In 2016, we had a great campaign and it was mostly about the border,\" he said recently in Nevada . \"And I did such a good job that in 2020, where we got millions of more votes than we did in 2016, but I couldn't talk about the border.\"\n\nThe lack of catchy slogans might not matter if they were just slogans. But in 2016, they were a symbol of Trump's willingness to talk about things that other candidates, including other Republicans, shied away from. When Trump promised to build the wall, he was demonstrating that he wasn't beholden to the somewhat centrist immigration-reform tendencies of the rest of the Republican Party and didn't care about political correctness. When he was attacked for the slogan, he smirked, \"The wall just got 10 feet higher.\"\n\nThe focus on the wall also showed that he was willing to deploy ( putatively ) \"commonsense\" ideas that other politicians weren't. This helped Trump to appeal not just to Republicans but to disaffected voters of all stripes. He had several such policy positions, including breaking with the bipartisan consensus on free trade, pledging to protect Social Security and Medicare, and claiming to have opposed the Iraq War from the start.\n\nOnce Trump was president, only a small portion of the wall got built, and Mexico didn't pay for it as Trump had promised. But although Trump likes to say at his rallies that he constructed 571 miles of the wall (an exaggeration ), he isn't now vowing to finish the job. In fact, Trump is emphasizing fewer big transformational ideas compared with 2016. His promises are a scattershot collection of ideas targeted at particular segments of the electorate: ending taxes on salary earned from tips, defending TikTok (a platform he once tried to ban), declassifying files on John F. Kennedy's assassination, rolling back fossil-fuel regulations. Although he promises to clamp down on the border and deport undocumented immigrants, you won't catch a \"Round 'em up\" chant at his rallies. And Project 2025, his allies' proposal to overhaul the federal government by massively expanding political patronage, doesn't lend itself to a bumper sticker.\n\nOn other issues, he seems to be grasping for a position that aligns with public opinion rather than offering his own bold proclamations. Where Trump once trumpeted his appointment of justices who overturned Roe v. Wade , he is now fumblingly trying to formulate a position on abortion that doesn't alienate either his base or swing voters, mostly relying on ambiguity. Regarding the war in Gaza, he has criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and called for the conflict to end quickly-but on Israel's terms. This may not be realistic, though it probably aligns with many voters' basic desire.\n\nTaking the place of all of this in his stump speech are dark warnings about President Joe Biden and talk of retribution for his political adversaries , including the current president. Trump allots a great deal of his stump speech to mocking Biden as incoherent and senile ( sometimes awkwardly ) while also warning that Biden's administration has made the United States a failed nation, and that his reelection could be fatal to the country. The disconnect between the images of Biden as doddering fool and as evil schemer is one that Republicans have struggled to reconcile but that Trump has concluded doesn't need resolving.\n\nRead: Trump wants revenge-and so does his base\n\nGrievance is not a new note at Trump rallies, but four and eight years ago, he used to talk about other people's grievances and promise to redress them. Now the grievances are largely his own, stemming from the legal cases against him and his loss in the 2020 election, which is so painful that he still won't recognize it. For some of his die-hard fans, this may resonate as proof of his claims that he is their champion: He tried to stand up for them, so the powers that be came after him. (This is absurd if you actually reflect on the cases against him .) Even so, this just serves to rile up the base, rather than speak to an imagined silent majority, as he did in 2016.\n\nIn a strange sense, Trump's campaign resembles the one that his rival Hillary Clinton ran in 2016. One big problem for Clinton was the criticism that she had no compelling goal for her candidacy other than that she wanted to be president. Trump's campaign now is about nothing so much as his desire to be president. He's running because he feels that the presidency was stolen from him in 2020 and because it will afford him a desperately needed legal shield . Even Project 2025 is about the accumulation of executive power itself, rather than any particular policy goal. Just like for Clinton, this might be enough to win Trump a majority of the popular vote; unlike for her, it might carry him to the White House. But it doesn't offer a great deal of inspiration or fun."

      "text": "MAGA Is an Extreme Aberration\n\nAll movements adjust their tactics over time. The president's most extreme supporters have concluded that violence is useful.\n\nT he moment at which the \"Make America great again\" movement became completely unmoored from the democratic process arrived at around 1 p.m. on January 6, when Congress was about to start certifying the 2020 electoral vote and, in doing so, seal President Donald Trump's defeat. On a stage near the White House, the president was an hour into a rambling speech. Supervising the electoral-vote count would be Vice President Mike Pence's job, and Trump had called upon him about 10 times to intervene . \"If Mike Pence does the right thing, we win the election,\" Trump had said. \"You'll never take back our country with weakness,\" he went on to tell the crowd.\n\nSome of Trump's supporters had begun trudging their way down Pennsylvania Avenue toward the Capitol. Others had gone straight there, skipping his speech entirely. At 1 p.m., members of MAGA-friendly groups, including the Proud Boys, were already waiting outside, some equipped with military-style gear. In a span of about 10 minutes , Pence issued a three-page statement saying that he would not use his role-typically a ceremonial one-to overturn the election. Congress began the count. And Trump explicitly told his followers , \"We're going to the Capitol ... We're going to try and give [Republicans] the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country.\"\n\nKimberly Wehle: 4 ways to prevent a future insurrection\n\nTrump supporters soon overwhelmed the Capitol. Wave after wave of so-called patriots smashed into police, eventually overcoming defenses and entering the building shortly after 2 p.m. For several hours, some protesters wedged themselves against thin police lines, while others pillaged the offices of members of Congress. Why were so few police officers stationed at the Capitol, when the president and his supporters for weeks had been signaling their desire to stop the certification ? At best, security forces had underestimated the kind of event the many networked factions of Trump's MAGA coalition had planned. But, especially after January 6, a MAGA event is not a normal protest.\n\nMost Americans have a sense of what a protest is-supporters of a cause gather near an important landmark to give speeches, wave signs, and march. Such events, which are generally expected to be nonviolent, are often the most grassroots way of seeking social change. In reality, not all protests are peaceful. If they get out of control, police form a line to counter the protesters, sometimes with piercing brutality.\n\nThe recent history of MAGA events, culminating in the \"Stop the Steal\" campaign to overturn the 2020 election, is an extreme aberration. Far from a grassroots movement to right an evident injustice, Stop the Steal is a coordinated disinformation campaign that brings together an all-star cast of Trump's most loyal supporters. Far from giving voice to the powerless, it is a last-ditch effort to disenfranchise millions for the sake of illegally reinstalling a defeated president of the United States. And disinformation was only the first step. Having lost at the polls, in the courts, and in state legislative chambers, the MAGA movement is trying to get its way through more and more brazen violence and intimidation.\n\nS cholars of social movements often look closely at protesters' past tactical choices to get a sense of how groups may behave in the future. If a tactic has some relative success, it will spread quickly from city to city through media networks, both traditional and social. Protesters tend to return to the same repertoire of action until the tactics no longer seem to work. What sociologists call tactical innovation occurs only when movements suffer some kind of defeat and must adapt to survive. Innovation can refer to the adoption of new communication technologies or the selection of different protest venues.\n\nFor the Occupy Wall Street movement (in which I participated), camping in parks gave way to distributed protests against banks, after a massive surge of arrests. The organizers seeking justice for Trayvon Martin, a Black teenager shot by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood-watch volunteer, began with rallies and vigils and turned to highway shutdowns following Zimmerman's acquittal on criminal charges.\n\nGroups resort to outright violence for a variety of reasons, sociologists say , but one reason is that they see in it a political opportunity. When institutional means for social change are closed off, violence can be strategic. In hindsight, MAGA's tactics over the past year show a disturbing escalation. Statehouse protests against public-health measures prompted by the coronavirus pandemic led not only to physical altercations , but also to a plot to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer .\n\nGretchen Whitmer: The plot to kidnap me\n\nSince Trump lost the election, his supporters have tried out a range of protest tactics. The most recent innovation, on January 6, was an overwhelming show of violence-which didn't succeed in overturning the count, but briefly sent Pence and Congress into hiding. Now, as Trump's followers promise an \" armed march on Capitol Hill & all state capitols \" over Martin Luther King Jr. Day weekend, the FBI and other agencies will have to hustle for intelligence on upcoming events, even as they are still tracking down and arresting the people who breached the Capitol. Far from concluding that the Capitol attack was a step too far, MAGA organizers may instead think that their intimidation campaign hasn't gone far enough.\n\nT he disinformation and intimidation have worsened in tandem. Although Trump had been impugning the election's credibility for months in advance, only after November 3 did members of pro-MAGA social-media groups begin showing up at the places where poll workers were counting votes, chanting \"Stop the count\" and, later, \"Stop the steal.\" Banging on glass and keeping watch for days, Trump's supporters were unsuccessful at disrupting the vote tallies, but the movement had gained momentum .\n\nOn November 5, Facebook removed one of the first \"Stop the Steal\" groups, which had grown to 350,000 members-but only after the platform's own algorithms \"drove 100 new people to join [that] group every 10 seconds,\" according to research from Ryerson University . The hashtag trended on Twitter and directed YouTube users to a huge corpus of pro-Trump content. MAGA's leading online influencers also had a ground game, organizing sporadic rallies in state capitals that built real-world connections among their social-media fans.\n\nMeanwhile, the top legal experts in MAGA world-figures such as Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, and Lin Wood-filed dozens of voter-fraud cases that had zero hope of succeeding on their merits. This was performative litigation . Its failure across multiple states offered \"proof\" that the legal system had failed the president. The lawyers coupled the litigation with testimony in state legislatures, where they made wild claims about zombie voters and double counts and Dominion Voting Systems machines with Communist vote-flipping algorithms . The claims, though absurd, created a grand narrative that ostensibly explained Joe Biden's decisive win.\n\nTheir false claims about election fraud were amplified on the incredibly popular YouTube channels run by Steve Bannon, Steven Crowder , and Tim Pool , and on the alternative cable networks Newsmax and One America News. But they didn't change the results. As all legal and institutional options were exhausted, a new, more militant approach was emerging for this growing coalition.\n\nDavid A. Graham: Why the rioters thought they could get away it\n\nOn December 12, the Proud Boys , a national network of far-right extremists, led a running riot through downtown Washington, D.C., during which four people were stabbed and countless others assaulted. The night closed as the Proud Boys stole a Black Lives Matter banner from a local Black church and torched it as cameras rolled. A week later, Trump promoted the planned electoral-vote demonstration with a tweet that will go down in history: \"Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!\" It was the culmination of a coordinated effort that connected online activism to grassroots militia groups, QAnon followers, and other far-right groups. He wasn't just summoning his followers on a whim.\n\nPerhaps though, nothing was as shocking as the New Year's Day posts from Wood, who fantasized that Trump would arrest Pence and sentence him to death.\n\nThe violent fantasies of certain leading MAGA figures aren't an embarrassment to the movement; they're part of its recruitment campaign.\n\nN o one should assume that Trump will recede into history on January 20. For the next few years, governors, district attorneys, and police should expect the worst if Trump tries to lead a rally in their jurisdiction, given the potential for violence and escalation. Mainstream Republicans, be warned: This is not your base. Failure to assess the real threat posed by MAGA is what led to the Capitol insurrection, and those seeking to keep Trump in office illegally should not be afforded another opportunity to innovate.\n\nJuliette Kayyem: How MAGA extremism ends\n\nThe failure of the Capitol Police and other agencies to anticipate last week's events also highlights law enforcement's failure to innovate in countering white-supremacist and violent extremists. These groups organize on open platforms that have little operational security. They brag endlessly about their plans, their guns, and whom they will murder. If journalists, internet archivists, anti-racism activists, academic researchers, and even Amazon's cloud-services unit are able to identify neo-Nazis posting online, what is preventing law enforcement from doing the same? This is not a rhetorical question-especially given evidence of some officers' lenient treatment of Capitol rioters.\n\nInternet platforms have finally begun to excise groups and individual accounts of MAGA influencers, including Trump himself, who spread disinformation and incite violence. Twitter removed more than 70,000 QAnon accounts . Mainstream platforms do not want to be organization points for large-scale attacks. Minor platforms, such as Parler and DLive, have been more willing to let such activity continue unfettered, but Parler lost its ability to use Amazon's web-hosting services and is no longer online.\n\nThe scale of the account and content removals on major platforms has thwarted the most-extreme MAGA supporters' ability to rally one another. However, platforms' enforcement measures have lacked consistency in the recent past, even as MAGA factions grew more violent. In the coming months, disinformation will remain everybody's problem. Only a whole-of-society approach can prevent the factions responsible for the January 6 attack from organizing online to cause future havoc offline."

      "text": "Trump's New Campaign Slogan Is a Confession of Failure\n\n\"Transition to Greatness\" is a corporate-style euphemism that tries to spin a collapse as a success.\n\nThere's no doubting the genius of \"Make America Great Again,\" Donald Trump's 2016 election slogan. While the campaign's operations were chaotic, the candidate volatile, and many of the policies contradictory, the phrase offered a clear, coherent summary of Trump's redemptive vision for the country. It was a testament to Trump's decades as a master marketer, though he took the phrase from Ronald Reagan; the president is a magpie, clever at borrowing and attracted to shiny things .\n\nThe one danger of a slogan so simple is that it offers a simple test for voters: After four years, Trump has either made America great again or he hasn't. The president long ago made the logical choice to assert that he had, even before he had any evidence to back it up. Days before he'd been inaugurated, he told a Washington Post reporter that his reelection slogan would be \"Keep America Great,\" though he has repeatedly re-announced it as \"new,\" garnering credulous press attention each time. The phrase wasn't quite as punchy as its predecessor-there was a reason Trump continued to employ MAGA, even in the self-proclaimed KAG era-and it raised the question of what the point of a second term would be , if he'd already made America great, but it sufficed for a while.\n\nBut the problem with running on a slogan of \"Keep America Great\" at the moment is ... well, look around. Nearly 100,000 Americans have died of COVID-19. The unemployment rate is nearly 15 percent, headed for 20 or 25 percent by the White House's own estimates. Regardless of how you allocate responsibility for this crisis, things plainly aren't great.\n\nThus was born \"Transition to Greatness,\" the third entry in Trump's greatness suite, and by far the weakest. \"Make America Great Again\" was a promise; \"Keep America Great\" was a declaration of victory. \"Transition to Greatness\" is a confession of failure, a corporate-style euphemism that tries to spin a collapse as a success, replacing the ambition of 2016 with the wan incrementalism of 2020.\n\nDavid A. Graham: Why does Trump want a second term?\n\nThe phrase first popped up on May 7, shortly after Trump first publicly acknowledged that the death toll might reach 100,000, and the day the Labor Department reported that 3.2 million Americans had filed new jobless claims.\n\n\"I'm viewing the third quarter as being a very important quarter because that's-as I said, that'll be a transition,\" he said at a White House event. \"I think you could almost say a 'transition into greatness,' because I think next year we're going to have a phenomenal year-a phenomenal year, economically.\"\n\nTrump must have liked the sound of that, because he used it several times at an event the next day, and it has since become a staple of his remarks and Twitter feed. \"We can go to Madison Avenue and get the best, the greatest geniuses in the world to come up with a slogan but that's the slogan we're going to use,\" he said May 8. \"'Transition to Greatness.'\"\n\nIn fact, the phrase is a flop, both as coinage and as messaging. Start with the language: Is there anything less exciting than a transition? There's a reason Barack Obama didn't offer \" transition\" you could believe in , because nothing inspires less enthusiasm. It's flat, dull, and corporate-the sort of language that executives use when they're trying to spin a setback as a minor blip on the way to success, which is of course exactly what Trump is doing here. It's not hat material .\n\nRead: Trump's 'new' slogan and the power of the small lie\n\n\"Transition to Greatness\" is bad political rhetoric too. Trump said he'd make America great. Now he's acknowledging that since America isn't great, he either couldn't make it great, or he failed to keep it great-betraying the two simple guarantees of the past two slogans. Reagan asked whether voters were better off than they were four years ago; Joe Biden might ask: Is America greater than it was four years ago? and point to Trump's own slogan as evidence it is not.\n\n\"My verdict is that 'Transition to Greatness' is, at the very least, confusing,\" writes Mark McKinnon , a former spinmeister for the presidential campaigns of George W. Bush and John McCain. \"But it is problematic, even more so, because it runs counter to the narrative Trump successfully pushed in 2016. He's pushing, instead, a lot of snake oil: He hasn't delivered the greatness yet, but try him again, and he'll deliver it next time.\"\n\nWhen greatness will arrive is anyone's guess. Maybe in the third quarter, as he said May 7. Maybe next year . Perhaps it \" has started, ahead of schedule .\" Maybe the real transition to greatness was the friends we made along the way . If Obama borrowed the title of Doris Kearns Goodwin's Team of Rivals to describe his White House, the historian's Wait Till Next Year might provide a better epithet for the Trump administration.\n\nAll of this blunts one of Biden's greatest weaknesses: the bland incrementalism he is promising, in place of a major change. (The Democrat's nostalgic approach echoes nothing so much as Trump's 2016 message, as I've argued , though they long for different regions of the past.) If Trump also has nothing more to offer than bland incrementalism, though, it weakens the contrast between them.\n\nDavid A. Graham: Trump never stopped campaigning long enough to govern\n\nThe notion that Trump can deliver on his promise of a transition to greatness beggars belief, too. Imagine that Trump wins reelection, a vaccine for COVID-19 becomes available quickly, and the economy bounces back quickly-all three of which are hardly chip shots. Assuming all that, what reason is there to believe that Trump will get done in a second term what he couldn't accomplish in the first? Put differently, what will he have next year that he doesn't already? Even if Republicans both hold the Senate and take back the House in the fall-not the expected outcome at the moment, but if Trump wins, his coattails could be long-that would bring only a return to the situation in 2017 and 2018, when most of Trump's initiatives (save a major tax cut) came up short.\n\nIt's extremely rare for a president's second term to be more productive than his first. Second terms are for consolidating achievements, and outside of his impressive reworking of the federal judiciary, which would continue, it's not clear what legislative successes Trump has to consolidate. (Trump's overhaul of governing norms, as well as his erosion of checks on the executive branch , is a different story.)\n\nOffering only a \"transition to greatness\" tries to elide all these difficulties by subsuming them into a gradual process, but in practice it only underscores the problems. People don't pick candidates based on campaign slogans, of course, and this clunker is unlikely to sway any votes. Nonetheless, the phrase's weaknesses show the challenge Trump faces in convincing voters that he should get a second term-and that greatness remains within reach."

      "text": "MAGA, the Next Generation\n\nTrump's political movement introduces the youngest voters to its kind of camaraderie.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nThe line began forming early Tuesday morning in Racine, Wisconsin, the usual river of red hats, cargo shorts, canes, and conspiracy theories, except that here and there were the fresh faces that the old-timers needed most.\n\n\"I was in fifth grade when Trump was elected,\" Kylie Smith, 18, was saying, excited for her first rally. \"I just remember my dad yelling, 'Trump won! Trump won!'\"\n\n\"I just wanted to be here-it's a learning experience,\" her friend Libby Kramer, 20, was telling me, as an older man in an I'm Voting for the Felon T-shirt listened in.\n\n\"Welcome to the party,\" he said.\n\n\"It's so good to see you girls,\" a white-haired woman wearing a Fuck Biden hat said.\n\nNearly a decade into the \"Make America great again\" movement, what Donald Trump needs to return to the White House is new voters, and among the most promising are the youngest, most impressionable voters of all. They were in elementary school when Trump was first elected, and the machinations being deployed to sweep them into the fold are less about issues such as Gaza or the planet or student loans than lights, screens, music, and the emotional appeal of righteous belonging-which has always been necessary for building armies and social movements.\n\nElaine Godfrey: The real youth-vote shift to watch\n\nThat kind of production has remained the essence of Trump rallies such as the one in Racine. And it has been the year-round specialty of Turning Point USA, the right-wing youth organization whose recent \"People's Convention\" in Detroit was a carnival of swirling lights and booming music, with sponsors including the Association of Mature American Citizens-the MAGA version of the AARP. That event drew a crowd of young attendees who cheered 70-year-old Steve Bannon as he yelled \"Victory or death!,\" and 78-year-old Trump as he spoke of \"the largest deportation operation in American history,\" and two young men in sunglasses who walked onstage and unfurled a red flag that read White Boy Summer , a white-supremacist slogan.\n\nOutside of such events, the task of introducing young people to the shame-free camaraderie of the MAGA movement has been up to social-media influencers, parents, and, as the election nears, long-timers at rallies such as the one in Racine, where an older woman scanned the faces up and down the line.\n\n\"It's so good to see all the young people here,\" she said.\n\nJust ahead, the rally was setting up in a park along a harbor of Lake Michigan: the stage, the screens, the speakers, the huge American flag hanging limp from a crane.\n\n\"I think we're moving,\" said a young man holding hands with his wife, both of them 21-year-olds for whom supporting Trump was a kind of rebellion.\n\n\"I grew up in a Democratic household, but I'm an adult now and I have to think for myself,\" the woman was saying as her husband pulled her ahead. \"We're against abortion; we're against illegal immigration.\"\n\n\"We don't support the culture Biden supports,\" her husband said, and behind him, an older woman in the ubiquitous Fuck Biden T-shirt offered her solidarity: \"And the economy has gone to hell-I'm scared for you young people.\"\n\nBehind her, a man from the state GOP was handing out cards. \"Join the Milwaukee GOP! We're on Instagram! We're on Twitter! The whole political world is coming to Milwaukee!\" he was saying, referring to the Republican National Convention next month.\n\nBehind him, the line was getting longer. There were mothers who'd brought daughters, and fathers who'd brought sons. Joe Vacek smiled and nodded as his 18-year-old son, Chase, said, \"I guess I was 12 when Trump was elected.\"\n\n\"Yep, we were at hockey practice,\" his dad said.\n\n\"I remember the TVs in the lobby and these big portraits kept coming up,\" the son said, recalling how Trump's image began to seep into his consciousness. \"I guess I started paying closer attention in 2020, especially when people started talking about election integrity. I was like, What are they talking about? , and I started researching.\"\n\nHe glanced at his father.\n\n\"You're doing great,\" Joe Vacek said.\n\nBehind them was 19-year-old Jordan Lazier, who'd come with his grandparents. He had decided that his first presidential vote would be for Trump.\n\n\"I remember when he was elected, I just liked him,\" he said, recalling how his mother felt similarly. \"I just knew he was better than Hillary; I couldn't tell you how.\"\n\n\"You're a smart kid,\" his grandmother said. \"Don't forget about the evil versus good.\"\n\n\"Good versus evil,\" Jordan repeated, looking at her. \"I know about satanic stuff most Democrats are into. Republicans talk about worshipping Jesus Christ, and Democrats worship the government.\"\n\n\"We listen to a lot of prophets, and we understand Bohemian Grove,\" his grandmother said, referring to some bleak corner of the QAnon conspiracy.\n\nBehind her, a veteran rallygoer was explaining something called the Rattle Trap conspiracy to a newcomer who was saying, \"There's so much out there I don't know about.\"\n\nBehind them were Bob Harper, 18, and Katherine Hughes, 19, who figured her journey to this point had begun in fifth grade, when her teacher instructed the class to color the states on a U.S. map red and blue after Trump got elected in 2016. That was the first time she thought about people as red or blue, and the country as something other than united. And she wanted to feel united, which is how being here made her feel.\n\n\"We can't really talk about all this with many kids our age-they call you racist, homophobic,\" Hughes said, referring to the mood on her community-college campus, where she said most students were liberal, and many were Muslim, and she felt ostracized.\n\n\"I just feel we should really be one country instead of divided,\" Harper said, and soon the line began moving faster.\n\nMusic started blaring from the rally site. Someone from the pro-Trump Right Side Broadcasting Network began filming, and people chanted for the camera, \"Trump! Trump! Trump!\"\n\nRead: The voters who don't really know Donald Trump\n\nTyler Marquisse, 19, was getting excited. He had driven over from his hometown of Kenosha, where the formative experience of his young political life had come in the summer of 2020, when protests and riots had broken out after the police shooting of a Black man named Jacob Blake, and a young white man named Kyle Rittenhouse had shot and killed two protesters. Marquisse was 14 at the time, and his reaction had mostly been fear. He recalled his parents telling him there was a gun in the bedroom, and a gun in the kitchen. They told him, \"If someone walks through that door, you protect yourself,\" and he remembered Trump coming to Kenosha soon after that.\n\n\"Trump protected us,\" he said now, standing near the front of a line that stretched several blocks past tables piled with T-shirts depicting Trump as an Old West outlaw, as a mafioso-looking convict, and with two middle fingers held up to the world.\n\nSeeing all of this, Matt Lahee, 20, was not sure what to think yet. \"I'm just curious mostly,\" he said, standing in line with his younger brother and his friend, both of whom were wearing red MAGA hats.\n\nLahee was not. He wasn't sure whom he would vote for in November. He had come with his siblings because he was home from school in Vermont, and because he wanted to see for himself what Trump and his rallies were all about.\n\nWhat he remembered about growing up in an upper-middle-class Chicago suburb with Trump as president: bobblehead dolls of Trump and Hillary Clinton. Snapchat groups where kids took sides. A social-studies teacher who had a Trump T-shirt on the classroom wall. Another teacher who taught students about mass incarceration. Neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, Virginia. Having Latino friends. Running track, fishing, and doing what you do as a kid up until 2020, when everything was upended by the pandemic and the police killing of George Floyd and the protests he never joined, even though he remembered the video, and feeling very sad about what happened.\n\n\"Hey, Matt?\" his brother, Ryan, said now. \"What was that thing you were saying in the car? About nostalgia?\"\n\n\"I was saying things seemed like they were going smoothly before COVID hit,\" Lahee said. \"But I don't know if that's just nostalgia, or if it was really better?\"\n\nHe wasn't sure, and now the line was moving, and soon they were all inside.\n\nTheir first Trump rally had soft green grass, and a view of Lake Michigan, and the smell of hot dogs and fries. A warm breeze was blowing, and the sun was out.\n\n\"Isn't it a great day to be at a Trump rally?\" one of the warm-up speakers said.\n\nPeople milled around. A young couple talked about the possibility of Trump being assassinated. A young man with long black hair, a beard, and an ankle monitor stood alone for a while until several police officers approached and quietly escorted him away. The loudspeakers began blaring \"Time in a Bottle,\" and older people mouthed the words.\n\nMatt Lahee found a place toward the back of the crowd.  He yawned. He sat on the grass through \"Pinball Wizard\" and a video of Elvis Presley, and when the crowd got restless and started chanting \"We want Trump!,\" he did not join in.\n\nWhen Trump arrived and \"God Bless the U.S.A.\" swelled and people hoisted their phones, Lahee folded his arms.\n\nHe listened as Trump mocked his successor's age, and the crowd chanted \"Fuck Joe Biden,\" and he did not join in. He listened as Trump talked about illegal immigrants and \"all the killing you're going to see unless you elect me.\" And as the crowd chanted \"Kick them out!\" and \"Do it! Do it!,\" he did not join in, and instead listened.\n\nHe listened to the whole hour-and-a-half speech, and when it was over and the Village People were blasting, he headed toward the exit, still unsure what all of this meant.\n\n\"I don't know,\" Lahee said. \"It was kind of dark.\""

      "website": "https://www.theatlantic.com",
      "text": "The Road to Making America Great Again Runs Through Asia\n\nThe secret to putting America First may lie in the continent's rising middle class.\n\nBack when Donald Trump was busy firing people on The Apprentice , corporate brands across America were busy \"hiring\" his show to advertise their wares. The list included Pepsi, McDonald's, Cheetos, KFC, Kellogg's Frosted Mini-Wheats, Wendy's, Yoplait, Subway, Visa, and Ford, to name just a few. Many of the companies that own those same brands, like PepsiCo (also owner of Cheetos) and Yum! Brands (owner of KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell), have surely been watching President Trump's ongoing trip to Asia with interest, because they understand a fundamental truth undergirding the global economy: Asia will drive future growth, anchored by a rising middle class hungry for consumer goods. American brands positioned to capitalize on that growth will survive and thrive.\n\nAmid now-President Trump's talk of winners and losers in the global economy and his pledges to make America great again by \"winning\" on trade and paring back the massive China trade deficit, one factor is often discounted. The rise of the East could, in fact, benefit the companies and peoples of the West. When President Barack Obama introduced his rebalance to Asia (aka, the \"Asia Pivot\"), he based the idea on the understanding that the world's political and economic center of gravity was shifting east. Too often, however, even in the Obama era, the Asia pivot was seen as a policy of containment of China, or a welcome respite from a fractious Middle East.\n\nMultinational companies, however, see the rise of Asia for what it is-a massive opportunity. Companies ranging from Unilever and Nestle, to Coca-Cola and Johnson & Johnson, are experiencing their fastest growth in emerging markets, particularly among middle-class consumers. The vast majority of those consumers reside in the Asia-Pacific: some 1.5 billion today, and a projected 3.5 billion by 2030, according to Homi Kharas, a scholar at Brookings who focuses on the global economy. The Kellogg Company seemed to speak for everyone in its 2016 annual report : \"Our success in emerging markets is critical to our growth strategy.\" If it fails, the company noted, its results will be \"materially and adversely affected.\" To make Kellogg, well, great again, it needs to ride the emerging-markets wave.\n\nMost American multinationals understand the necessity of tapping new areas of consumption growth around the world, and, as the S&P notes , it's in the emerging markets. And there is no more important part of that story than Asia's growing middle classes. As Kharas noted, of the next billion entrants into the middle class worldwide, 88 percent of them will be Asian. Asian consumers will account for the overwhelming majority of new middle-class spending through 2030, to the tune of some $29 trillion. Ford, for instance, sold its millionth car in the Asia-Pacific last year.\n\nAs the potential of Asian markets expands, American companies are seeing a decline at home. Companies like Pepsi, Subway, and Ford, are seeing their sales in North America flat line . As American millennials increasingly shun big name, older brands of the sort that advertised on The Apprentice in favor of smaller, local, or organic brands, it's no wonder that the Kellogg Company wants to build its emerging-markets portfolio.\n\nThe Asian expansion is in full force. McDonald's will storm China with some 2,000 new restaurants by 2021, bringing its total there to 4,500. China is well on its way to becoming the number two global market for the Golden Arches, according to the company's CEO, Steve Easterbrook. If McDonald's hits its goals, it will be within striking distance of KFC, which already has more than 5,000 restaurants in China. Yum! Brands, the Kentucky-based parent company of KFC as well as Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, earned about half of its global revenues from China last year. Starbucks is also chasing the Chinese middle class, aiming to double its number of locations there from 2,500 to 5,000 by 2021. That's almost two branches launching every single day for the next four years.\n\nThe larger point: U.S. companies that create jobs and drive growth in Americans' stock portfolios are finding their most rapid growth in Asia. Apple is on pace to generate some $45 billion in revenue from what it calls greater China (including Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan) in fiscal year 2017. \"We are very bullish on China,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said on a recent earnings call. \"We continue to see a middle class that's booming there.\" Apple also reported strong quarterly earnings this month on the back of China growth.\n\nThis is the part of the story that Trump missed with his \"America First\" economic nationalist speech at a Pacific Rim summit in Vietnam on Friday. \"We are not going to let the United States be taken advantage of anymore,\" he said. \"I am always going to put America first.\" This idea-that the world is running circles around America-can hardly be reconciled with the story of corporate America: the biggest, richest, most global, innovative, and dynamic private sector in the world, its products found in every corner of the planet. There are only two countries in the world where the Coca-Cola Company does not do business: North Korea and Cuba. Coca-Cola-stan spans the globe. If Facebook were a country, its user base would make it the largest country in the world. Some of America's top companies, from Apple to Walmart, have market capitalizations putting them on par with entire nations .\n\nWith numbers like these, corporate America can hardly cry foul. Yes, there are areas where tariffs and bans need lifting. But to dismiss the global trading system as one big \"globalist\" con job as top Trump ally Steve Bannon does and Trump regularly implies fails to take into account the more than 20 million jobs in the United States attributable to exports and foreign investment, according to Commerce Department figures. Last year, China invested $46 billion in the United States, a record-shattering year, according to the Rhodium Group, a New York-based consultancy. Rhodium also noted that China's investments help fuel economic growth and create jobs.\n\nOf course, every president will need to negotiate the best deals. One area where jaw-boning has worked is beef exports. The Trump administration has resumed U.S. beef exports to China after a nearly decade-and-a-half ban due to a bogus Mad Cow disease claim by China. America's \"Beef Belt,\" stretching from Texas to Montana, hailed the China opening. During Trump's Asia tour, a major Chinese online retailer announced plans to buy up to $1.2 billion of beef and pork from the United States.\n\nSay what you will about the Middle Kingdom, but when Americans go to sleep at night, they better hope they don't wake up to an economic implosion in China. China today is the world's largest consumer of energy, metals, movies, most commodities, and even beer. When its economy slows, it brings down the wider Asia-Pacific region and has ripple effects felt from Argentina to Angola to, yes, the United States. China has become systemically important to the global economy-too big to fail.\n\nThe same goes for Asia writ large. Consider the S&P 500, the bellwether index of corporate America. Some 8.5 percent of all sales among S&P companies go to Asia, more than Europe. Asia is also the world's largest importing region, accounting for 36 percent of all global imports. The United States and European Union, combined, account for 31 percent of imports. By 2020, there will be more smartphone users in Southeast Asia than in the United States. And in South Asia, dizzying change is afoot. Every second, three Indians log onto the internet for the first time, and Pakistan has become a hot growth market for U.S. companies.\n\nIn a world where more than half of global GDP hails from emerging markets, America's fortunes are increasingly tied to the rest of the world, especially Asia. Indeed, of the 10.7 million American jobs supported by exports, nearly a third of them are supported by exports to the Asia-Pacific region, larger than Europe or North America.\n\nPresident Trump may not realize it, but Asia may be a vital anchor for the \"Make America Great Again\" economic renaissance he promised. Asia's rising middle-class consumption could, ironically, become an important piece in the rebuilding of America's own faltering middle class. The \"woe-is-us\" story of America getting exploited by the world is wearing thin."

Here's Why That Matters\n\nIn announcing his broad-scale tariffs on Wednesday at the White House, President Donald Trump said this of Lee Iacocca , a businessman he had in the distant past dealt with: \"He's an older guy, real pro, really top guy.\"\n\nIacocca was a legendary automobile executive. He was at the peak of his powers in the 1980s. He died in 2019.\n\nHow many Americans under the age of, say, 55 even know Iacocca's name-much less what he did? 15%? That may be generous.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe point here is not to run down Iacocca. He was legitimately famous for decades! Instead, it's to note that Trump really is stuck in the '80s. With everything from his cultural references to his views of how the American economy works best, he is firmly rooted about four decades ago.\n\nConsider this exchange between Trump and Chuck Todd on Meet the Press back in 2015:\n\nChuck Todd : All right. Your slogan, we're going to hear it a lot today at the fair. \"We're going to make America great again.\" When was the -\n\nDonald Trump : Great slogan.\n\nTodd : When was the last time America was great?\n\nTrump : I would say during the administration of Ronald Reagan you felt proud to be an American. You felt really proud. I don't think since then to any great extent people were proud.\n\nReagan, in case you forgot, was president for the bulk of the 1980s.\n\nTrump's cultural references are all '80s too. Bob Hope ! Arnold Palmer -and his genitals ! Lee Greenwood. The late great Hannibal Lecter . (OK, Silence of the Lambs came out in 1991 but still...)\n\nThe president's views on the efficacy of tariffs were also formed-and are stuck-in the '80s. Here's Trump talking about how we were getting ripped off on trade with Oprah Winfrey in 1988:\n\nThe problem, as I see it for Trump, is that there's no way we can go back to the American economy of the 1980s. The globalization genie is out of the bottle. We now live in a world of deep economic interconnectedness. I am very skeptical that Trump's tariff policies will reverse engineer almost five decades of such expansion. But make no mistake: That's exactly what Trump wants to do.\n\nHe wants to Make the 1980s Great Again.\n\nWant more ball and strike calling-no matter what uniform the batter at the plate is wearing?

      "text": "Brazen Trump Tweet Suggests He'd Break the Law to 'Save' America\n\nNews Reporter\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Saturday seemed to imply that he was willing to break the law in order to bring about his vision of America.\n\n\"He who saves his Country does not violate any Law,\" Trump wrote in a post that was blasted to both Truth Social and X.\n\nThe cryptic post, which appears to quote a fictional version of French dictator Napoleon Bonaparte from the 1970 film Waterloo , comes as Trump's agenda has faced pushback from the courts.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNo fewer than four federal judges have blocked Trump's attempt to end birthright citizenship-which is enshrined in the Constitution-with an executive order.\n\nEarlier this week, the courts also halted , at least for now, Trump and Elon Musk 's efforts to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).\n\nAnother of the many legal challenges to Trump's new administration has argued that Musk's Department of Government Efficiency is unconstitutional.\n\nHe who saves his Country does not violate any Law.\n\nHowever, if Trump's post is any indication, the president isn't willing to let the court system impede his sweeping new plan to Make America Great Again. The White House did not immediately respond to the Daily Beast's request for clarification on what the post means.\n\nTrump's brazen insinuation set off alarm bells for those worried about just how far the president might go in defying the law.\n\n\"Trump is not simply breaking domestic and international law-he is boasting about it openly. He no longer even pretends to hide his contempt for the Rule of Law,\" British academic and commentator Rory Stewart posted on X.\n\nSelf-described Libertarian journalist Brad Polumbo called Trump's post \"actually a profoundly disturbing sentiment.\"\n\nDemocratic Rep. Ritchie Torres suggested that Trump's statement was at odds with the foundation of the U.S.\n\n\"Donald Trump seems to believe he can do whatever he wishes in the name of 'saving the country,'\" the New York lawmaker wrote . \"In our constitutional republic, the means matter more than the ends. The US Constitution trumps the policy preferences of President Trump.\"\n\nDonald Trump seems to believe he can do whatever he wishes in the name of \"saving the country.\" In our constitutional republic, the means matter more than the ends.

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"\n\nThe call for revenge was echoed, even more emphatically, by MAGA pundit Charlie Kirk, who took to X soon after the hearing.\n\n\"The people who went after Trump should be investigated and charged,\" he wrote . \"All of them. Justice is coming.\"\n\nThe people who went after Trump should be investigated and charged. All of them. Justice is coming.\n\nThe mantle was also taken up by another prominent MAGA influencer, Trump's lawyer and adviser Mike Davis. In an appearance on a far-right livestream show on Friday, Davis issued an ominous warning.\n\n\"Right now, the Democrats think they're the hunters,\" he said. \"But guess what, on Jan. 20, at noon, they're going to become the hunted. And I'm going to make damn sure of that.\"\n\nBREAKING: Trump Lawyer Mike Davis just issued a major warning to Judge Juan Merchan & all other Democrats who engaged in lawfare against President Trump. \"The Democrats think they're the hunters. On January 20th at Noon, they're going to become the hunted.\" Davis then told... pic.twitter.com/QB2YfHJDtm\n\nThe list of people Trump has blamed for his conviction is lengthy, but his most frequent targets include Merchan, the judge who oversaw his case, and Democratic leaders like Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, one of Trump's most notoriously outspoken allies, called out the judge by name.\n\n\"Judge Merchan engaged in criminal abuse of power to attack the Democrat's top political opponent, Donald Trump,\" she alleged on X. \"Shamefully, Judge Merchan and the Democrats didn't perceive terrorists, cartels, and everyday street criminals as threats to democracy.\"\n\nAnother of Trump's top supporters in the House, Nancy Mace, railed against the left and echoed his allegations of unfairness soon after the sentencing.\n\n\"This is so corrupt,\" she posted on X. \"The most corrupt. They're only doing this today, 10 days before his swearing in, so the Left and the lamestream media can call him a convicted felon for the next 4 years.\"\n\n\"I'm with the convicted felon. #MAGA,\" she added in a separate post.\n\nI'm with the convicted felon. #MAGA\n\nBernie Moreno, the freshly elected Ohio senator whose campaign was supported by the president-elect, was similarly incensed by the hearing.\n\n\"The only crime committed in the fake New York case against President Trump was in that court room,\" he said on X.\n\nLoudly disavowing the \"SHAM TRIAL and a HOAX SENTENCING!,\" Rep. Ronnie Jackson, meanwhile, argued that the result was only a short-term defeat for the president-elect.\n\n\"Trump will win in the end and America wins in 10 days when we get Trump back!!\" he wrote on X.\n\nThe sentencing hearing came after Trump was convicted on 34 counts related to falsifying business documents to cover up a hush-money payment to the porn star Stormy Daniels.\n\nAlthough Trump will not face prison time, fines, or probation, he will carry the distinction of being the first convicted felon to serve as president.\n\nNews Reporter\n\nliam.archacki@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

Because if they do, people are gonna buy American-made cars,\" Trump said in a phone call with NBC Sunday.\n\nOn Fox, Bream noted that 69 percent of Americans think tariffs will make products more expensive.

Bush.\n\nTrump said he had been tested like no other president before winning November's election.\n\n\"The journey to retake our republic has not been an easy one. Those who wish to stop our cause have tried to take my freedom and indeed, to take my life just a few months ago, in a beautiful Pennsylvania field, an assassin's bullet ripped through my ear, but I felt then and believe, even more so now that my life was saved for a reason,\" he insisted.\n\nNow Trump says his presidency heralds a new \"golden age\" for America.\n\n\"The vicious, violent unfair weaponization of our government will end,\" he told the 600 VIP guests at his inauguration inside the Rotunda on Capitol Hill .\n\n\"From this moment on, America's decline is over,\" he continued. \"We will be the envy of every nation and will not allow ourselves to be taken advantage of any longer.\n\n\"As we gather today, our government confronts a crisis of trust,\" he said. \"For many years, a radical and corrupt establishment has extracted power and wealth from our citizens, while the pillars of our society lay broken and seemingly in complete disrepair.\"\n\nHe complained about the response of the Biden administration to the Hurricane in North Carolina in September 2024 and the recent fires in California.\n\nHe said his election victory was a mandate to reverse \"this horrible betrayal.\"\n\n\"We now have a government that cannot manage even a simple crisis at home, while at the same time stumbling into a continuing catalog of catastrophic events abroad,\" he continued.\n\n\"It fails to protect our magnificent law-abiding American citizens, but provides sanctuary and protection for dangerous criminals.\n\n\"All of this will change starting today and it will change very quickly,\" he added.\n\nJoe Biden and Kamala Harris showed little emotion during the speech. Bill and Hillary Clinton whispered and laughed with each other when Trump mentioned he planned to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America.\n\nTrump said his new term meant that the \"decline is over.\"\n\nTrump said he will spearhead a \"revolution of common sense.\" He said his administration would only recognize two genders and would declare a national emergency at the southern border.\n\n\"My message to Americans today is that it is time for us to once again act with courage, vigor, and the vitality of history's greatest civilization,\" he said.\n\nHe claimed he will give people \"back their faith, their wealth, their democracy.\"\n\n\"Many people thought it was impossible for me to stage such a historic political comeback, but as you see today, here I am, the people have spoken, that something is impossible to do,\" he said, concluding his 30-minute speech.\n\n\"From New York to Los Angeles, from Philadelphia to Phoenix, from Chicago to Miami, from Houston to right here in Washington, D.C., our country was forged and built by the generation of patriots that gave everything they had for our rights and our freedom.

Get smart, tough, and send the Bill to my desk to sign as soon as possible,\" he wrote in a Sunday evening post on his Truth Social network. \"MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"\n\nTrump has made promises to enact a merciless immigration crackdown that could see millions deported, to cancel green energy projects to make way for more oil and gas drilling, and to extend tax cuts passed during his first term that disproportionately benefit the rich.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe reasserted his claim that he will finance these plans with tariffs on imports of foreign goods, which experts say could make inflation worse for American consumers.\n\n\"Members of Congress are getting to work on one powerful Bill that will bring our Country back, and make it greater than ever before,\" Trump wrote. \"We must Secure our Border, Unleash American Energy, and Renew the Trump Tax Cuts, which were the largest in History, but we will make it even better-NO TAX ON TIPS,\" he added, hinting at the sweeping agenda he expects congressional Republicans to quickly enact, including a promise to remove income tax on service workers' tips.\n\n\"IT WILL ALL BE MADE UP WITH TARIFFS, AND MUCH MORE, FROM COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE U.S. FOR YEARS,\" Trump wrote.\n\nHouse Leader Mike Johnson (R-LA) told Fox News earlier Sunday that, despite having a razor-thin majority in the lower chamber, he plans to pass the sweeping legislation in the House by early April and get it to Trump's desk by Memorial Day.\n\nWhile Johnson has made peace with what he called Trump's idea of a \"big, beautiful bill,\" other Republicans on Capitol Hill have expressed reservations about the one-bill approach.\n\nThe right-wing House Freedom Caucus made its opposition to one big policy bill known last month in a letter to Johnson demanding one bill to deal with border security and a \"larger reconciliation bill covering taxes, spending, energy, bureaucracy, and more.\"\n\nIn the House, where the GOP has the slimmest majority in nearly a century, it would only take one or two Republicans to break rank to jeopardise a piece of legislation's prospects. In fact, it required Trump's personal intervention last week to get Johnson reelected speaker after Reps. Ralph Norman (R-SC) and Keith Self (R-TX) initially opposed.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) seemed to express reservations on Sunday about Trump's ambition, namely his ability to enact his hardline immigration agenda. \"Is it realistic to deport everybody?\" he asked during an appearance on Meet the Press , \"I mean, there's a lot of people in this country who are here illegally.\"\n\nThune's remarks appeared to suggest a belief the incoming administration may want to consider adopting a more incremental approach to its core policy.\n\nsean.craig@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

The movement calls for the return of Trump to the White House at all cost, asserting that Trump should be authoritarian and ruthless in his pursuit of power.

      "text": "Even Trump Can't Make Sense of His Own Dark-Money Maze\n\nSenior Political Reporter\n\nPay Dirt is a weekly foray into the pigpen of political funding. Subscribe here to get it in your inbox every Thursday.\n\nAn inquiry from the feds has thrown new light on the murky relationships between a dozen Trump-aligned groups. And the problem traces back, as do so many other problems in Trumpworld, to a familiar name: former top aide Corey Lewandowski.\n\nWhen Lewandowski got himself fired from a pro-Trump super PAC last fall-after allegedly sexually assaulting a big donor-the group brought in a clean-up crew. When Lewandowski refused to step down, they opened up a new super PAC without him.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThat super PAC-the preposterously titled \"Make America Great Again, Again!\"-was the 12th in a sprawling labyrinth of political groups and nonprofits that comprise the Trump fundraising network. And in terms of the incestuous confusion, it may have been the one that finally tipped the scales; federal election officials now want to know why some of the super PAC's payments aren't being properly reported.\n\nBrendan Fischer, deputy executive director of good government group Documented, said the extent of Trump's network is unparalleled.\n\n\"It is worth emphasizing: All of this is totally unprecedented for a former president,\" Fischer told The Daily Beast. \"Even if Trump kept it simple, and just had one hard money PAC, a single super PAC, and a pair of 501(c)(3)/501(c)(4) nonprofits, there would be no parallel with any former president in American history.\"\n\nAnyone who's taken even the quickest of peeks at Trump's personal financial disclosures would recognize the pattern.\n\nHis first such disclosure revealed positions with more than 500 entities, nearly 400 of which used his name or initials. And Trump has \"organized\" the mess in a stultifying Russian-nesting-doll structure-companies within companies within companies. Frequently, one company will be held under multiple Trump companies at the same time, each with stakes in still other Trump companies.\n\nThis isn't an accident. The structure gave the Trump Organization an enormous amount of financial flexibility, while making it difficult to follow the billions of dollars that Trump, his family, and his accountants move across the organization.\n\nWhen Trump hauled his private life into politics, he brought this practice with him, too.\n\nThe full Trump-aligned apparatus counts a dozen separate political committees and dark money organizations. Almost all of them share one of three names.\n\nHere they are:\n\n\"Typically, former presidents focus on their presidential library, or start a charitable foundation, but Trump is staying in the political game and raising a staggering amount of cash,\" Fischer said.\n\nIt is staggering.\n\nWant a closer look inside the pockets of the government's most powerful players? Subscribe to the Pay Dirt newsletter here for exclusive reporting every Thursday.\n\nFor instance, the Trump-endorsed America First Action super PAC pulled in nearly $200 million between 2017 and 2020. Its sister nonprofit, America First Works-formerly America First Policies-posted $51.3 million in revenue for 2020, doling out nearly $40 million in grants.\n\nThe TMAGA PAC raised $884 million for 2020, with Trump Victory tossing in another $336.3 million . Those guns mostly fell quiet last year, while Trump's three new PACs built up a $124.4 million stash, with another $12.5 million in the MAGAA! super PAC.\n\nAnd we won't know how much those other dark money nonprofits raised in 2021, or what they did with it, until after the midterms.\n\nAs Trump and the Republican Party gear up for 2024, these groups are in various stages of repair. However, that also appears to have created some internal problems. In fact, according to a filing on Wednesday, even the Trump campaign admits it isn't always able to follow its own money.\n\nFischer chalked up the mess to a few factors, including Trump's will-he-or-won't-he candidate status, his relationship with the Republican National Committee, and disarray among his associates.\n\nBut Brett Kappel, a specialist in campaign finance and nonprofit law at Harmon Curran, perceived something more designed.\n\n\"The central lesson of Watergate is ' Follow the money )\" href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QodGxD19_as__;!!LsXw!QMOq4spFWjW5idgaIBxthPO_Ti_qYPMIJ4o8m-Tlu3GJZdVCtpvS2fxe7GyaX5988bjG51YSWyw0YWVWUAasHrLMLDm7PDC-$\">Follow the money ,'\" Kappel told The Daily Beast. \"And this byzantine structure of different types of legal entities-which are subject to different fundraising restrictions and file different reports with different agencies according to different filing schedules-appears to be designed to make that task as difficult as possible.\"\n\nTo illustrate, these organizations can be divided into two groups: PACs and joint fundraising committees, and \"dark money\" nonprofits.\n\nThe PACS and joint fundraising committees are Trump's political organizations. They disclose their finances to the Federal Election Commission. But they don't all follow the same filing schedule, and, depending on what kind of committee they actually are, they can raise and transfer different amounts of money from different types of people and organizations.\n\nOf these groups, Save America leadership PAC is currently Trump's main squeeze. Most of the money he raises goes there. The Save America JFC is a joint committee that splits donations between Save America and MAGA PAC, which used to be the Trump campaign. Weirdly, MAGA PAC doesn't get much out of this joint arrangement-more than 90 percent of every contribution goes to the Save America PAC.\n\nAnd the super PACs are, as mentioned above, something of a mess.\n\nAs for the \"dark money\" nonprofits, unlike the PACs, these groups file with the IRS. They don't have to disclose their donors at all (hence \"dark money\"). They also only file once a year, and because those deadlines are so late, it can take nearly two years for a transaction to become visible to the public.\n\nThe IRS restricts their activities, too. Some groups have leeway to be political (the 501(c)(4) groups). Some must focus on social welfare (the 501(c)(3) groups). The Trump network has a healthy helping of both.\n\nSometimes, however, these PACs and nonprofits can overlap, even sharing employees and office space, like America First Action and America First Policies did during the Trump administration.\n\nAnd while they appear to be giving that another go, as the FEC found, it hasn't been so clean this time.\n\nEnter Lewandowski.\n\nAfter Trump left the White House, the industriously sycophantic Lewandowski wormed his way back into his graces, winning the right to run the Make America Great Again Action super PAC. At the same time, he quietly created a Florida nonprofit, Make America Great Again Policies Inc.\n\nBut MAGA Policies didn't appear to do anything-at all. There has been no reporting on any actual activity since it was created. Zero. It is a black box.\n\nThen Lewandowski reportedly sexually assaulted a Trump donor and got himself booted from orbit . More experienced hands took over the new MAGAA! super PAC, led by former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi, and that also got complicated.\n\nAccording to a new corporate filing in Florida, Bondi-who also happens to lead the massive America First Policy Institute nonprofit-also took over Lewandowski's mysterious MAGA Policies nonprofit, adding former Trump administration officials Ric Grenell and Matt Whitaker, as well as Donald Trump Jr. paramour Kimberly Guilfoyle. All of those people are also on the new super PAC's payroll.\n\nBut here's the rub: The super PAC hasn't been paying them directly. The nonprofit has, as part of a \"cost share agreement.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, the FEC sent the super PAC a letter saying that's not cutting it. The group needs to explain exactly what they mean by \"cost share agreement,\" the letter said, because what they provided is not adequate.\n\nKappel said the FEC may be trying to figure out whether the two groups are \"financially and operationally independent.\" If the super PAC was found to be \"connected\" to the MAGA Policies nonprofit, he said, that means it can only raise money from people tied to the nonprofit-and not from the general public. That would be a death blow, and the group would be forced to reorganize itself yet again.\n\nFischer said he wouldn't be surprised to see more groups strategically shut down, like Trump Victory began doing last year.\n\n\"It might be more straightforward for Trump to shut down MAGA PAC,\" he said, though he pointed out that MAGA PAC appears to own the campaign's valuable supporter data, which might make it more cost-effective to retain for joint fundraising efforts.\n\nBut, Fischer pointed out, even though the constellation of Trump-aligned groups is basically unnavigable, it always could have been worse.\n\n\"Recall that Brad Parscale also started the 'American Greatness' super PAC in 2021, which never really got off the ground,\" he said.\n\nSubscribe to the Pay Dirt newsletter here to follow the movement of the dirty dollars influencing our public policy.\n\nSenior Political Reporter\n\nRoger.Sollenberger@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

Early Friday morning, an intruder broke into House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's San Francisco home, attacking her 82-year-old husband Paul with a hammer, fracturing his skull. The intruder, David DePape, 42, was arrested. DePape's online presence is a horrifying mix of conspiracy theories, racism, election denial and antisemitism. \"Where's Nancy? Where's Nancy?\" DePape screamed at Paul Pelosi, using a phrase chanted in the U.S. Capitol during the January 6, 2021 insurrection. Pelosi managed to call 911, leaving the call connected so the dispatcher could hear as he tried to negotiate with the intruder. The dispatcher called on the San Francisco Police to conduct a wellness check. DePape attacked Pelosi as the police arrived, and was quickly arrested. Pelosi was rushed to the hospital. DePape has been jailed, charged with multiple state and federal crimes.\n\n\"Make America Great Again,\" Trump proclaims, never saying when in our painful, tumultuous history America was, in fact, \"great.\" That phrase's acronym, \"MAGA,\" has been embraced by Trump's supporters and his many detractors, as both a battle cry of the right and a catchall warning used by defenders of democracy.\n\n\"American democracy is under attack because the defeated former president of the United States refused to accept the results of the 2020 election,\" Biden said Wednesday. \"He has made the Big Lie an article of faith of the MAGA Republican, the minority of that party...They have emboldened violence and intimidation of voters and election officials.\"\n\nSince Trump's 2020 loss, threats against election officials have intensified. The Brennan Center for Justice issued a report in 2021 that detailed reports from states across the country, of numerous confrontations and threats against election workers - many laced with racism and anti-semitism. Republican state legislatures accelerated the voter suppression crusade, passing scores of laws aimed at restricting access to the vote. Early voting, mail-in voting, Voter ID laws and even, in Georgia, a law making it illegal to provide water to someone waiting in line to vote, have all been enacted.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll, released last week, found that two in five voters are concerned about the threat of violence or intimidation at polling places during these midterm elections, and that two-thirds of registered voters expect extremists to carry out acts of violence if they are unhappy with the election results.\n\nIn Arizona, masked, armed vigilantes wearing body armor were monitoring a 24-hour ballot drop box location. The League of Women Voters of Arizona went to federal court and won a temporary restraining order against the voter intimidation group, Clean Elections USA . Maricopa County Board of Supervisors chair Bill Gates and County Recorder Stephen Richer issued a joint statement that included the line, which itself serves as a measure of how bad things have gotten, \"Don't dress in body armor to intimidate voters as they are legally returning their ballots.\" So far, at least six instances of voter intimidation have been reported to the Justice Department by Arizona's Secretary of State.\n\nIn rural Nye County, Nevada, election deniers suspicious of ballot-scanning devices successfully compelled the county to adopt hand-counting of ballots. The county clerk resigned in protest, and the hand counting has not been going well. Human errors abound and the process has been ordered halted. But not before Nye County Republican Party Central Committee Vice Chair Laura Larsen, wearing a gun, ejected a legal election observer from the ACLU ,  attempting to confiscate the person's notes.\n\nThe attack on Paul Pelosi was part of a failed attempt to either kidnap or assassinate House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, second in line to assume the presidency. In response, prominent Republicans from Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin to Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake to Donald Trump, Jr. joked about that attack.\n\nNormalizing and inflaming political violence, as Donald Trump and his Republican enablers are doing, ensures more bloodshed. The resilience of our democracy depends on free, fair and vigorous participation from all eligible voters. Political violence must be condemned, and countered with massive voter turnout.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

In his inaugural address, Trump took immediate aim at diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI . The bigotry embedded in Trump's plans to \"Make America Great Again\" is stark-purging people of color and LGBTQIA people, not only from employment in the federal government, but from public life. But people have fought for too long, and too many have died, in the fight for equality.\n\n\"Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\" refers to a system of policies and practices that promote fair treatment, full participation, and full access to employment and opportunities for all, especially for people from historically marginalized communities. Trump is, in effect, attempting with the stroke of a pen to undo over 60 years of hard-won progress in overcoming racism, sexism and other forms of bigotry.\n\n\"Today is Martin Luther King Day,\" Trump said in his inaugural speech in the Capitol Rotunda, one of the only factually accurate statements he made. He went on, \"In his honor, we will strive together to make his dream a reality. We will make his dream come true.\"\n\nMoments later, though, he pledged,\n\n\"This week, I will also end the government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life. We will forge a society that is colorblind and merit-based.\"\n\nFollowing the speech, Trump issued a flurry of executive orders. Within hours, a form letter was emailed to federal departments, ordering the suspension, by end of day Wednesday, of any staff working on DEI initiatives, and giving remaining staff ten days to report any ongoing \"disguised\" DEI activity, ie, to rat out colleagues.\n\nWhile Trump spoke at his inauguration, a different gathering was taking place just a few blocks from the White House. Hundreds packed into the historic Metropolitan AME Church, the storied Black church that abolitionist Frederick Douglass attended, and where his funeral took place. In 2005, after Rosa Parks lay in state in the Capitol, her casket was moved to Metropolitan AME , for a memorial service.\n\nCivil rights activist Rev. Al Sharpton was speaking at the same moment as Trump. Hearing that Trump had invoked King's name in his speech, Sharpton responded:\n\n\"Donald Trump just said that he is going to end DEI this week, he's gonna put out his executive orders. You have all these corporations that are saying they're gonna back off DEI . Why do we have DEI ? We have DEI because you denied us diversity, you denied us equity, you denied us inclusion. DEI was a remedy to the racial institutional bigotry practiced in academia and in these corporations. Now you want to put us back in the back of the bus? We're going to do the Dr. King/Rosa Parks on you. We will call you out one by one, and we will shut you down.\"\n\nLater on King Day, Trump held a rally where he signed the first stack of executive orders, including a blanket rescission of many of President Biden's executive orders, including at least 15 that advanced diversity, equity and inclusion. Later, Trump signed a much broader order calling for the termination of all \"illegal DEI and 'diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility' ( DEIA ) mandates, policies, programs, preferences, and activities in the Federal Government,\" and to \"terminate, to the maximum extent allowed by law, all DEI , DEIA , and 'environmental justice' offices and positions.\"\n\nThe \"A\" in DEIA stands for \"accessible,\" thus extending Trump's war on fellow citizens to include the disabled.\n\nSharpton and other speakers invoked not only Martin Luther King, Jr. and Rosa Parks, but the whole sweep of history, from the first arrival of enslaved Africans in 1619, to Frederick Douglass, to the role of freed slaves fighting in the Civil War, through the protests in 2020 following the police killing of George Floyd.\n\nMarc Morial, President of the National Urban League, convened an emergency \"Demand Diversity\" roundtable in Washington DC on Wednesday. While Trump was inaugurated on King Day, Morial pointed out that Trump is no king:\n\n\"These executive orders are unlawful, they are unconstitutional, and they seek to do what we always suspected. This is not a monarchy. You can't rule by decree or edict. This is a constitutional democracy...we have to remember this as we go into this very important battle.\"\n\nParticipants in the roundtable, representing over 20 national civil rights and human rights organizations, form the core of a coalition committed to fighting Trump's agenda. The coalition is guided and inspired by the memory and the lessons of Martin Luther King, Jr. Organize, boycott, resist. These are the struggles, ultimately, that history will remember as great.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Biden said, \"Too much of what's happening in our country today is not normal,\" and that MAGA Republicans present a \"clear and present danger to our democracy,\" referring to Trump's campaign slogan of \"Make America Great Again.\" We speak with Nancy MacLean, author and Duke University historian, who says Biden's speech was a \"wake-up call\" for the nation and mainstream media. \"He was absolutely right, in my opinion, that the Trump wing of the party and the MAGA Republicans have jumped the rails of constitutional democracy, of the factual universe and of representative democracy.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nPresident Biden gave a primetime speech Thursday night warning Donald Trump and his MAGA supporters are threatening the foundations of the republic. Biden spoke in Philadelphia in front of Independence Hall, where the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution were debated and signed. This is part of President Biden's speech.\n\nPRESIDENT JOE BIDEN : Too much of what's happening in our country today is not normal. Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic. Now, I want to be very clear, very clear up front: Not every Republican, not even the majority of Republicans, are MAGA Republicans. Not every Republican embraces their extreme ideology. I know, because I've been able to work with these mainstream Republicans. But there's no question that the Republican Party today is dominated, driven and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans. And that is a threat to this country. ...\n\nMAGA Republicans do not respect the Constitution. They do not believe in the rule of law. They do not recognize the will of the people. They refuse to accept the results of a free election. And they're working right now, as I speak, in state after state, to give power to decide elections in America to partisans and cronies, empowering election deniers to undermine democracy itself.\n\nMAGA forces are determined to take this country backwards, backwards to an America where there is no right to choose, no right to privacy, no right to contraception, no right to marry who you love. They promote authoritarian leaders, and they fan the flames of political violence that are a threat to our personal rights, to the pursuit of justice, to the rule of law, to the very soul of this country.\n\nThey look at the mob that stormed the United States Capitol on January 6th, brutally attacking law enforcement, not as insurrectionists who placed a dagger to the throat of our democracy, but they look at them as patriots. And they see their MAGA failure to stop a peaceful transfer of power after the 2020 election as preparation for the 2022 and 2024 elections. They tried everything last time to nullify the votes of 81 million people. This time, they're determined to succeed in thwarting the will of the people.\n\nThat's why respected conservatives, like Federal Circuit Court Judge Michael Luttig, has called Trump and the extreme MAGA Republicans, quote, \"a clear and present danger\" to our democracy.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : President Biden, speaking in Philadelphia Thursday night. He went on to say the soul of the nation is at stake.\n\nPRESIDENT JOE BIDEN : I ran for president because I believed we were in a battle for the soul of this nation. I still believe that to be true. I believe the soul is the breath, the life and the essence of who we are. The soul is what makes us us. The soul of America is defined by the sacred proposition that all are created equal in the image of God, that all are entitled to be treated with decency, dignity and respect, that all deserve justice and a shot at lives of prosperity and consequence, and that democracy - democracy must be defended, for democracy makes all these things possible.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : President Biden, speaking Thursday night. Just after the speech, Democracy Now! reached Ben Jealous, president of People for the American Way, former head of the NAACP , to get his response.\n\nBEN JEALOUS : Tonight we saw Joe Biden give the most presidential speech he's ever given as president. I say this as somebody who's both been a friend of Joe for a long time in politics and yet also taken serious issue when I thought that he was moving in the wrong direction. I was arrested for voting rights protests five times in front of his White House last year. And what we saw tonight was exactly the president we need in this moment.\n\nHe was confident. He was clear about big victories for the climate, big victories for students, big victories for the economy. He was also very clear that he was drawing a line between MAGA extremists and the patriots that are the rest of this nation. He was very clear that we are at an existential moment, a moment I think most of us feel in our bones. And he was also clear, as a student of history, that we have been through worse and triumphed over it.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : To talk more about President Biden's speech, we're joined by Nancy MacLean, author of the book Democracy in Chains: The Deep History of the Radical Right's Stealth Plan for America , professor of history and public policy at Duke University in North Carolina. She's actually joining us now from Raleigh.\n\nWelcome back to Democracy Now! , Professor MacLean. Why don't you start off by sharing your overall response to the speech at Independence Hall in Philadelphia?\n\nNANCY MacLEAN: Thank you, Amy. It's good to be with you again.\n\nMy overall response is that this was the most important speech of President Joe Biden's political career, and it was a wake-up call to the nation, and particularly to the mainstream media, in the nick of time. He was absolutely right, in my opinion, that the Trump wing of the party and the MAGA Republicans have jumped the rails of constitutional democracy, of the factual universe and of representative democracy. You cannot have a democracy in which one party does not accept the legitimacy of the other party's candidates, elected officials and the outcomes of elections. But that is where we have come with Donald Trump and the MAGA faction since they first questioned the legitimacy of President Obama's election and denied that he had been born in America. That was the start of all that has ensued since. And it's really important that President Biden called that out for the nation.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to go back to President Biden speaking last night in Philadelphia.\n\nPRESIDENT JOE BIDEN : Today there are dangers around us we cannot allow to prevail. We hear - you've heard it - more and more talk about violence as an acceptable political tool in this country. It's not. It can never be an acceptable tool. So I want to say this plain and simple: There is no place for political violence in America, period. None. Ever.\n\nWe saw law enforcement brutally attacked on January the 6th. We've seen election officials, poll workers - many of them volunteers of both parties - subject to intimidation and death threats, and - can you believe it? - FBI agents, just doing their job as directed, facing threats to their own lives from their own fellow citizens.\n\nOn top of that, there are public figures - today, yesterday and the day before - predicting and all but calling for mass violence and rioting in the streets. This is inflammatory. It's dangerous. It's against the rule of law. And we, the people, must say: This is not who we are.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : President Biden, speaking at Independence Hall last night in Philadelphia, the second of three trips to Pennsylvania in just a matter of days. His third one will be in the next few days. Professor MacLean, as he talks about political violence, you have said the best predictor for a successful coup is a failed coup for which there is no accountability. Talk about the political violence, how it's been dealt with, what it means and what should be done.\n\nNANCY MacLEAN: Yes. Thank you. And I think that's extremely important for people to understand. And that's not just me speaking; that is the consensus of comparative political scientists who study coups. So, absolutely, we do not yet have accountability at the highest levels for the events of January 6 and the ongoing criminal conspiracy against our country that has been more than demonstrated by the House select committee to investigate the events of January 6. And the problem is that if you don't have accountability, those acts become normalized, and the people who engage in them become emboldened to become more aggressive, more violent, more threatening.\n\nAnd I think, you know, something that Biden said at the very top of his remarks is extremely important, that so much that has happened in recent years, and certainly in the last year, is not normal. And the problem that I see as an educator is that there are young people growing up who have known nothing else but this moment. And there are many of us who have been so bruised by the pandemic and inured by years of this Trump rhetoric and aggression, and that coming from his followers, that we can start to think that this is how a normal democracy functions.\n\nBut it is not. The United States has slipped radically down the scale of healthy democracies. Ten is the highest rating you can get. By 2021, global evaluators were saying that we were down at five, with Poland, Slovenia and Hungary. Hungary is interesting, because the MAGA Republicans and figures like Tucker Carlson look to Hungary's leader, Viktor Orbán, as a model. And he is a model for them of how to use democracy to completely undermine democracy and make it impossible to remove an authoritarian leader.\n\nSo, Biden's calling out of all this is extremely important, because we have allowed ourselves to get to the point where threats and intimidation and violence are routinely used to intimidate people. Let me be frank: This is terrorism. It has been directed most recently at the FBI , at our National Archives, where the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution are housed. It has been directed at teachers and school boards. It has been directed at public health officials. It has been directed at Dr. Fauci and his family.\n\nAnd yet mainstream news continues to practice bothsidesism, continues to pretend that these things are just partisan. You know, I am so glad that you are doing this extended segment on President Biden's speech, because I was shocked last night to learn that three major news networks were not carrying the speech. Even NPR , when I got up this morning and turned on the radio, they gave it the most minimal coverage and just put it in the context of the midterms, as though this was politics as usual. And I think that's the exact opposite of the message the president was rightly trying to send.\n\nWe face existential threats to democracy in America, and they are coming from one place: from Donald Trump and those he has persuaded to follow him with the big lie, with a calculated system of media disinformation. And what's most important is that he and the donors behind this, and that media, have also cowed every Republican elected official in office, except Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, both of whom have been defeated, and others less well known who have spoken the truth, who have stood up to Donald Trump and who have stood up to the lies, who have lost office or are leaving office because they know they cannot be reelected by this MAGA party.\n\nWe are absolutely, as the president said, at an inflection point in our country, and we must take stock and treat the coming midterms as truly the chance we have to save democracy from further wreckage. There's no point in talking about candidates for 2024 if we do not stop the election deniers and the election riggers from gaining control in state after swing state, as they are trying to now. Those are the people who won all the Republican primaries.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I wanted to go to Donald Trump, who appeared on Newsmax this week, admitted he's financially supporting people arrested during the January 6th insurrection and more.\n\nDONALD TRUMP : So, I met with a number of fans, but I met with and I'm financially supporting people that are incredible. And they were in my office actually two days ago. It's very much on my mind. It's a disgrace what they've done to them. What they've done to these people, it's disgraceful. And mostly, I mean, you know, it's firemen, they're policemen, they're people in the military. ... And I will tell you, I will look very, very favorably about - about full pardons.\n\nWENDY BELL : Amen.\n\nDONALD TRUMP : If I decide to run and if I win, I will be looking very, very strongly about pardons.\n\nWENDY BELL : Amen.\n\nDONALD TRUMP : Full pardons.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, President Donald Trump, former, who is signaling he might be running again, that he would give them full pardons, and also talking about police and firefighters that he's supporting. In fact, a former New York police officer was just sentenced to 10 years in prison - that's the latest news out from yesterday - because he attacked a police officer with an American flag pole. If you can talk about what he has just said, Professor MacLean?\n\nNANCY MacLEAN: Yeah. What he has just said, Amy, is something that should terrify us all. We have seen a Republican Party over the years that has tried to treat the rival party of Democrats as illegitimate, ever since the days of Newt Gingrich using language that's inflammatory, tossing around words like \"treason.\" Well, frankly, what Donald Trump just described was treasonous conduct. He is talking about issuing blanket pardons to people who waged an attack on our country, an attack that took the lives of, ultimately, seven police officers, that resulted in millions of dollars' worth of damage, that desecrated our Capitol and shamed us before the world. And he is talking about financially supporting those people and plans to issue pardons to them. And not only is he not calling them criminals, people who violated the law, engaged in violence, attacked our country, he is actually elevating them as heroes.\n\nAnd here I want to go back to something that Joe Biden said that got him in a lot of trouble with Republicans because he called out something accurate. When he used that phrase \"semi-fascist\" the other day to describe the MAGA Republicans, I believe that was an apt phrase. We are not in a fascist situation in America, but we have elected officials and their followers in one party behaving in a fascistic way. Donald Trump just illustrated that with his lionization of people who engaged in criminal violence.\n\nThis is extremely important, because if you look back to the interwar period that brought us the regime of Mussolini, which is marking its 100th anniversary this year of the March on Rome, and later Hitler, they started with that kind of violence, that kind of celebration of violence, and also an effort to conquer major institutions of the society and make them serve this project.\n\nLook at what Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans are doing. They are trying to conquer critical institutions. He has pardoned people in the military who engaged in illegal conduct. He has lifted them up as heroes. He has now elevated, as you're saying, those police officers who violated the law on January 6. We have had, again, such attacks on election boards and public health workers in this country, and on teachers, that we are seeing hemorrhaging in those fields. We don't have enough nurses. We don't have enough public health people. We don't have enough people in so many of the core institutions of our society. We also have Republicans attacking the domain where I work - higher education - spreading lies, attacking teachers, trying to divide students and faculty from community.\n\nWe are at red-alert stage. In military terms, it is DEFCON 1 for democracy in America. And it's time that the mainstream media started to recognize that. President Biden gave us the call and said exactly what is happening in very clear and eloquent terms. So we can only hope that Americans respond calmly, deliberately and with determination to alert their neighbors, to canvass for these midterms, to make sure people understand the high stakes of these elections. It is only the people who will be the guardrails of our democracy responding in a calm, nonviolent, determined way to ensure that we still have a democracy for generations to come, for our children and grandchildren.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Professor MacLean, you've also made it clear that this is not just about President Trump, saying that our situation is driven by our extreme-right fossil fuel and dirty industry donors who have radicalized the Republican Party. Can you elaborate?\n\nNANCY MacLEAN: Yes. Thank you, Amy, for raising that, because the donor question has all but fallen out of so much of the conversation and of the media attention to the problems we're facing. But this is what I researched for Democracy in Chains , and particularly the Koch network of donors, convened by Charles Koch, the CEO of Koch Industries, one of the richest men in the world, who has convened other wealthy donors, not only in the United States, by the way, but globally, particularly from the fossil fuel sector, tobacco and other dirty industries, to try to shackle democracy. They have supported this Republican Party. They were the ones who drove it to the far right with the tea party, you know, and, before that, the efforts of the radical Republicans, like Newt Gingrich, in Congress. They are a serious threat to our democracy.\n\nAnd actually, this is one of the interesting things that distinguishes our moment from the interwar period that saw Mussolini and Hitler come to power. Mussolini and Hitler came up from the streets, through street fighting and radical violence, and then later won the backing of right-wing sections of capital and other institutions, like the church and the military. In our country, we've seen something different. These dark money, fossil fuel donors, led, above all, by Charles Koch, have so poisoned the workings of our electoral system that we are in this position. And we will not solve this problem that we face, we will not get out of this crisis, unless we address that dark money, not only the money going to elected officials, but the money that is going tax-free to fund an apparatus of literally hundreds of organizations that are polluting our public debate, that are turning us against one another, that are distorting and deforming our institutions and that have brought us to this precipice.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Last question, Nancy MacLean. Before you wrote Democracy in Chains , you wrote Behind the Mask of Chivalry: The Making of the Second Ku Klux Klan , published decades ago. But there you look at that period in the 1920s, right around the time, in the '20s, '30s, when you had Mussolini and you had Hitler rising to power, but in the United States, where you looked at how some 5 million ordinary white Protestant men joined the second Ku Klux Klan in the '20s. Do you see parallels to today?\n\nNANCY MacLEAN: Yes, Amy, and it - really, it gives me chills to say it. And sadly, the book is getting a second life all these years later, because it's not just me: Ordinary Americans see the parallels. Donald Trump and this radicalized Republican Party has breathed life into these white supremacist, white nationalist forces. It's no longer the Ku Klux Klan in the forefront, but we see groups like the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers, the Three Percenters and all these, you know, kind of freelance militias, who are committed to a set of ideas very much like those of the Ku Klux Klan of the 1920s, and milder forms of which are embraced by this MAGA faction of the Republican Party, namely the idea that only certain people are legitimate Americans, particularly white middle-class Christians, that other people don't belong, that they're there on suffrage, that - sufferance, rather - that white Christian Americans have the right to run the country, have the right to drive others out or subdue them, and have the right to dictate, and that somehow that is God-given, and that those elements of our history that President Biden referenced last night, the ideals of the Declaration of Independence, that all men are created equal, that all people deserve dignity and voice, that is a reaction against that. It is a rejection of the multiracial democracy and the country that is supposed to be open to the progress and achievement of all.\n\nSo, these ideas, sadly, have come back to us. It's like rocks have been lifted up around the country, and oxygen has been given to these forces that were always there but not encouraged in the way that they have been in the last several years of Donald Trump's dominance of the public discussion. So, again, I think President -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We have five seconds.\n\nNANCY MacLEAN: - Biden was absolutely right to say - to mention white supremacists and to say that this is an emergency for our country and that we all must pay attention and, if we care about democracy, commit to making sure it will last and it will work for all of us.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Nancy MacLean, author of the book Democracy in Chains: The Deep History of the Radical Right's Stealth Plan for America , professor of history and public policy at Duke University in North Carolina.\n\nNext up, as millions of Californians face extreme heat, we go to Los Angeles to look at the city's most vulnerable, the unhoused, and the programs to place them in vacant hotel rooms. Sixty thousand unhoused on any given night, 20,000 vacant hotel rooms. Stay with us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

I'm Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : We end today's show with a remarkable new book titled How Fascism Works: The Politics of Us and Them , which focuses in particular on current trends under the Trump administration, arguing that the president is not as much of an anomaly in American history as we often think. The book's author, Yale professor Jason Stanley, whose parents were both Holocaust survivors who came to the U.S. as refugees, shows instead that, quote, \"In its own history, the United States can find a legacy of the best of liberal democracy as well as the roots of fascist thought (indeed, Hitler was inspired by the Confederacy and Jim Crow Laws),\" Jason Stanley writes. He also warns of the dangers of normalizing fascist politics, saying, quote, \"What normalization does is transform the morally extraordinary into the ordinary. It makes us able to tolerate what was once intolerable by making it seem as if this is the way things have always been.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We're joined right now by Jason Stanley, philosophy professor at Yale University. His new book is just out. It's titled How Fascism Works: The Politics of Us and Them . His previous books, How Propaganda Works .\n\nWelcome to Democracy Now! Professor, it's great to have you with us. Why now? Why are you releasing this book, How Fascism Works , now?\n\nJASON STANLEY : Well, we have a global, ultranationalist far-right movement crossing many countries-Bolsonaro in Brazil, we've just seen-and they feed off each other. So, I think right now it's very important to make people aware of the features of fascism, the historical features, and to alert people to the fact that the United States has always been vulnerable to this kind of politics.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Well, explain what fascism-define what it means for you.\n\nJASON STANLEY : So, fascism is an ideology based on power. Liberal democracy is based on liberty and equality. Liberty and equality require truth, because you need truth to speak truth to power, and a free-if you're lied to, you're not free. No one thinks the people of North Korea are free. They've been lied to. So, if you're going to attack liberal democracy and replace it with power, you need to smash truth. So, fascism is an ideology based on power and loyalty. It creates-it's based on hypernationalism, so one group-loyalty to one group. And one person, the leader, represents that group. It's hypermasculine and hyperpatriarchal.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You talk about the 10 pillars of fascism. What are they?\n\nJASON STANLEY : The 10 pillars of fascism are, number one, a mythic past, a great mythic past which the leader harkens back.\n\nNumber two, propaganda. There's a certain kind of fascist propaganda where everything is inverted. The news is the fake news. Anti-corruption is corruption.\n\nSo, three, anti-intellectualism. As Steve Bannon said, it's emotion-rage gets people to the polls. We got elected on \"Lock her up!\" and \"Build the wall!\" Hitler, in Mein Kampf , says you want your propaganda to appeal to the most-to the least educated people.\n\nNumber four, unreality. You have to smash truth. So, reason gets replaced by conspiracy theories. I first started writing, got out of my academic shell in 2011, when I wrote a piece about birtherism, because I saw conspiracy theories coming, and that's a deeply concerning sign. Unreality. So, you smash every-smash truth, so all that remains is loyalty.\n\nHierarchy. In fascist politics, the dominant group is better than everyone else. They were like the loyal-the great people in the past who deserve respect just for being them.\n\nVictimhood. In fascism, the dominant group are the greatest victims. The men are the greatest victims of encroaching feminism. Whites are the greatest victims of blacks. Germans are the greatest victims of Jews.\n\nLaw and order. What are they victims of? They're victims of the out group, who are criminals. What kind of criminals are they? They're rapists. Sexual anxiety.\n\nPillar nine is Sodom and Gomorrah. The real values come from the heartland. The people in the city are decadent.\n\nAnd pillar 10 is \" Arbeit macht frei \"-work shall make you free. The out group is lazy. They're not just criminals; they're lazy. And social Darwinism. It's all about winning.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Well, I want to turn to one of the features of fascism as you identify it, this unreality. Trump was speaking earlier this year, and he took aim at the media, as indeed he has multiple times, using a phrase that prompted comparisons with George Orwell's dystopian novel 1984 .\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : Just remember, what you're seeing and what you're reading is not what's happening. ... Because we have to make our country truly great again. Remember, \"Make America Great Again,\" and then in two-and-a-half years, it's called \"Keep America Great.\"\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : So that's Trump speaking earlier this year, and just to say that George Orwell's line reads, \"The party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command.\" So can you talk about this particular feature of fascism as you see it in the U.S. under Trump?\n\nJASON STANLEY : Yeah. Trump is very clear that loyalty to him is the only guide. Reality is, of course, the greatest threat to fascism, because fascism is based on power, and reality is a way of responding to power. You say, \"It's just false.\" So you have to make everyone destabilized, not connected to the truth. And you have to represent yourself as reality. And you have to show that you're stronger than reality, because fascism is about machismo and power.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You are the son of Holocaust survivors. How does that weigh in to your scholarly work and what you're seeing now, and whether you believe you can talk about the United States in this way right now?\n\nJASON STANLEY : Well, I remember when I talked to my father about being the son of a Holocaust survivor, and he read me James Baldwin's 1968 piece, \"Negroes Are Anti-Semitic Because They're Anti-White.\" And he said-and one of the lines in it was \"You think you're more connected to us because of our shared history of oppression. We're more angry at you because of our shared history of oppression, because we know you're glad not to be us.\" So, because of my background-my mother worked in Manhattan criminal court for 33 years-I knew that the United States was replicating features of Nazi Germany and Eastern Europe with respect to its black population. So, I was raised with an understanding of racialized mass incarceration. I lived through it. We're still living through it. Nine percent of the world's prison population is black American. So I have been continually-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Nine percent of the world's?\n\nJASON STANLEY : -world's prison population comes from that tiny group of 38 million people. If the nation of black America was its own country, it should be the third largest nation on Earth. And that's an emergency. So we came in. We've long had this fake news directed against our black population. And it's completely unsurprising that someone came and then said, \"Hey, you're used to fake news being directed against this population. Let's just generalize it and direct it against everyone.\"\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : So, what are the antecedents to Trump in America you say there are? We have about 30 seconds.\n\nJASON STANLEY : The antecedents to Trump are, well, the KKK , obviously, the 1930s. The America First movement is an antecedent to Trump. He references it. And throughout-look, Nixon is an antecedent to Trump. He ran a harsh law-and-order campaign in 1968. He slashed social spending to increase crime. So, Nixon is a good-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We're going to continue the conversation after the broadcast, and we'll post it under web exclusives at democracynow.org. Jason Stanley, philosophy professor at Yale University. His book is How Fascism Works: The Politics of Us and Them .\n\nI'll be speaking tonight in Washington, D.C. , interviewing Angela Davis at Busboys and Poets, at the 450 K location in Washington, D.C.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Giroux is the McMaster University professor for Scholarship in the Public Interest.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: We end today's show with a look at a new book that argues America is at war with itself. From poisoned water in Flint and other cities to the police deaths of African Americans, including Keith Lamont Scott, Eric Garner and Sandra Bland, to hatemongering on the presidential campaign trail, Henry Giroux critiques what he believes is a slide toward authoritarianism and other failings that led to the current political climate.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Noted scholar Robin D.G. Kelley writes in the book's foreword, quote, \"These are indeed dark times, but they are dark not merely because we are living in an era of vast inequality, mass incarceration, and crass materialism, or that we face an increasingly precarious future. They are dark because most Americans are living under a cloak of ignorance, a cultivated and imposed state of civic illiteracy that has opened the gates for what Giroux correctly sees as an authoritarian turn in the United States. These are dark times because the very fate of democracy is at stake-a democracy fragile from its birth, always battered on the shoals of racism, patriarchy, and class rule. The rise of Donald J. Trump is a sign of the times,\" he writes.\n\nWell, for more, we're joined by the author of America at War with Itself , Henry Giroux, MccMaster University professor for Scholarship in the Public Interest. He joins in New York City.\n\nWe welcome you. It's great to have you with us.\n\nHENRY GIROUX : Well, I'm honored.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : How is America at war with itself?\n\nHENRY GIROUX : It's at war with itself because it's basically declared war not only on any sense of democratic idealism, but it's declared war on all the institutions that make democracy possible. And we see it with the war on public schools. We see it with the war on education. We see it with the war on the healthcare system. We see it, as you said earlier, with the war on dissent, on the First Amendment. We see it in the war on women's reproductive rights.\n\nBut we especially see it with the war on youth. I mean, it seems to me that you can measure any degree-any society's insistence on how it takes democracy seriously can, in fact, be measured by the way it treats its children. And if we take that index as a measure of the United States, it's utterly failing. You have young people basically who-in schools that are increasingly modeled after prisons. You have their behavior being increasingly criminalized. And one of the most atrocious of all acts, you have the rise of debtors' prisons for children. Kids who basically are truant from school are being fined, and if they can't-their parents can't pay the fine, they're being put in jail. You have kids whose every behavior is being criminalized. I mean, what does it mean to be in a public school, and all of a sudden you are engaged in a dress code violation, and the police come in, and they handcuff you? They take you out, they put you in a police car, put you in the criminal justice system, and all of a sudden you find yourself, as Tess was saying earlier, marked for life. Entire families are being destroyed around this.\n\nSo, but it seems to me the real question here is: How do you understand these isolated incidents within a larger set of categories that tell us exactly what's happening? And what's happening is the social state is being destroyed, and the punishing state is taking its place. So violence now becomes the only tool by which we can actually mediate social problems that should be dealt with in very different ways.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, you devote an entire chapter to Donald Trump's America.\n\nHENRY GIROUX : Yeah.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And you specifically talk about the-how the media coverage of Trump has sort of divorced him from any past history of the country, in terms of the development of right-wing demagogues and authoritarian figures.\n\nHENRY GIROUX : That's an important question. I mean, you live in a country marked by the culture of the immediate. You live in a country that's marked by celebrity culture, you know, that basically infantilizes people, paralyzes them, eliminates all notions of civic literacy, turns the school into bastions of ignorance. They completely kill the radical imagination in any fundamental way.\n\nAnd I think that what often happens with Trump is that you see something utterly symptomatic of the decline of a formative culture that makes democracy possible. Juan, you have to have informed citizens to have a democracy. You don't have an informed citizenry. You don't have people who can think. Remember what Hannah Arendt said when she was talking about fascism and totalitarianism. She said thoughtlessness is the essence of totalitarianism. So all of a sudden emotion becomes more important than reason. Ignorance becomes more important than justice. Injustice is looked over as simply something that happens on television. The spectacle of violence takes over everything.\n\nI mean, so it seems to me that we make a terrible mistake in talking about Trump as some kind of essence of evil. Trump is symptomatic of something much deeper in the culture, whether we're talking about the militarization of everyday life, whether we're talking about the criminalization of social problems, or whether we're talking about the way in which money has absolutely corrupted politics. This is a country that is sliding into authoritarianism. I mean, it is not a-you cannot call this a democracy anymore. And we make a terrible mistake when we equate capitalism with democracy. And-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You talk about the ethical bankruptcy of the U.S. ruling elites paving the way for Donald Trump.\n\nHENRY GIROUX : You know, you live in a country in which we have separated all economic activity from social cost, from ethical considerations. The ethical imagination, in itself, has become a liability. And I think that when people like you and others make that clear, that you can't have a democracy without that kind of ethical intervention, without assessing, you know, the degree to which people in some way can believe in the public good, can believe in justice, you have the heavy hand of the law pouncing on you. And I think that when the radical imagination dies, when an ethical sensibility dies, you live in a state of terrorism, you live in a state of fear, you live in a state in which people can't trust each other. Shared fear has become more important than shared responsibilities. And that's the essence of fascism.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And what sign of hope do you see out of all this-\n\nHENRY GIROUX : I think there are a lot of signs. And thank you for the question. I mean, I think, at some level, we see young people all over the country mobilizing around different issues, in which they're doing something that I haven't seen for a long time. And that is, they're linking these issues together. You can't talk about police violence without talking about the militarization of society in general. You can't talk about the assault on public education unless you talk about the way in which capitalism defunds all public goods. You can't talk about the prison system without talking about widespread racism. You can't do that. They're making those connections.\n\nBut they're doing something more: They're linking up with other groups. If you're going to talk about Flint, if you're going to talk about, it seems to me, Ferguson, you have to talk about Palestine. If you're going to talk about repression in the United States, you've got to figure out how these modes of repression have become global. Because something has happened that we-that suggests a new kind of politics: Politics is local, and power is global. The elite float. They don't care about the social contract anymore. So, you know, we see a level of disposability, a level of violence, that is really unlike anything we've seen before.\n\nI mean, Donald Trump talking about the Central Park Five still being guilty, give me a break. I mean, what is this really about? Is it about somebody who's just ignorant and stupid? Or is it somebody who now is part of a ruling class that is so indifferent to questions of justice that they actually boast about their own racism?\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So let me ask you about the issue of education.\n\nHENRY GIROUX : Right.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The debate here is around school choice-\n\nHENRY GIROUX : Right, right.\n\nHENRY GIROUX : -of vouchers, charter schools. But you've been talking about schools for a long time. What is the role of schools and education in our society?\n\nHENRY GIROUX : Schools should be democratic public spheres. They should be places that educate people to be informed, to learn how to govern rather than be governed, to take justice seriously, to spur the radical imagination, to give them the tools that they need to be able to both relate to themselves and others in the wider world, in a way in which they can imagine that world as a better place. I mean, it seems to me, at the heart of any education that matters, is a central question: How can you imagine a future much different than the present, and a future that basically grounds itself in questions of economic, political and social justice?\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And so, how do you see, then-for instance, the Obama administration has been a big promoter of charter schools and these privatization efforts as a school choice model.\n\nHENRY GIROUX : Yeah. The Obama administration is a disgrace on education. The Obama administration basically is an administration that has bought the neoliberal line. It drinks the orange juice. I mean, it doesn't see schools as a public good. It doesn't see schools as places where basically we can educate students in a way to take democracy seriously and to be able to fight for it. It sees them as basically kids who should be part of the global workforce. But it does more, because not understanding schools as democratic public spheres means that the only place you can really go is either to acknowledge and not do anything about the fact that many of them are now modeled after prisons, or, secondly, they become places that kill the radical imagination. Teaching for the test is a way to kill the radical imagination. It's a way to make kids boring, you know? It's a way to make them ignorant. It's a way to shut them off from the world in a way in which they can recognize that their agency matters. It matters. You can't be in an environment and take education seriously, when your education is under-when your agency is under assault. Can't do it.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You begin your book with a quote of Albert Camus: \"Memory is the enemy of totalitarianism.\"\n\nHENRY GIROUX : Yeah. Yeah, yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Explain.\n\nHENRY GIROUX : Well, I'll explain it in terms of a slogan, Donald Trump's slogan: \"Let's make America great again.\" You know, and when I hear that, that seems to suggest there was a moment in the past when America really was great, you know, when women knew their places, when we could set dogs on black people in Mississippi, when young people went and sit in at lunch counters and were assaulted by others. That's about-that's about the death of memory. That's about memory being basically suppressed in a way that doesn't allow people to understand that there were things that happened in the past that we not only have to remember, we have to prevent from happening again. Or, on another level, it suggests the suppression of memory so that those things can happen again and that we don't have to worry about them. And so, it seems to me that a country without a sense of public memory, without a sense of historical memory, is a country always in crisis.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You have talked about Donald Trump also coming about, the phenomenon, as the-a failure of the progressive left.\n\nHENRY GIROUX : Yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : How?\n\nHENRY GIROUX : Well, I think that, you know, one of the things about the left-three things about the left disturb me, Amy. One is, they never really have taken education seriously. They think education is about schooling. I mean, what they don't realize is that forms of domination are not just simply structural. They're also about changing consciousness. They're also about getting people to invest in a language in which they can recognize that the problems that we're talking about have something to do with their lives. It means making something meaningful, to make it critical, to make it transformative.\n\nSecondly, it seems to me that the left is too involved in isolated issues. You know, we've got to bring these issues together to create a mass social movement that in some way really challenges the kind of power that we're now confronting.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Only the beginning of the conversation. Henry Giroux, thanks so much for being with us, McMaster University professor for Scholarship in the Public Interest. His new book, America at War with Itself .\n\nThat does it for our broadcast. Oh, Juan, tomorrow is a very special day: Happy birthday!\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Amy, thank you.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, we'll be-\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: You didn't need to mention that.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We'll be broadcasting Monday from North Dakota, from right near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. Tune in.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

The United States controlled the waterway until 1977, when President Jimmy Carter signed a landmark treaty to give Panama control of the canal. Trump has also recently floated the idea of annexing Canada, and even a possible \"soft invasion\" of Mexico. Pulitzer Prize-winning Yale historian Greg Grandin explains the practical impossibilities of such plans but analyzes the political impacts of Trump's statements. \"There's no way the United States is going to fill out greater America. This is red meat for the Trump base,\" says  Grandin. \"It's classic Trump.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org. I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nWe turn now to look at how President-elect Trump has threatened to retake the Panama Canal. The United States controlled the waterway after its completion in the early 20th century. But in 1977, President Jimmy Carter signed a landmark treaty to give Panama control of the canal, which, by providing a path through Central America, revolutionized maritime shipping. During a speech in Arizona Sunday, Trump threatened to retake the canal.\n\nPRESIDENT - ELECT DONALD TRUMP : If the principles, both moral and legal, of this magnanimous gesture of giving are not followed, then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to the United States of America, in full, quickly and without question.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Panama's President José Raúl Mulino rejected Trump's threat in a video he posted online.\n\nPRESIDENT JOSÉ RAÚL MULINO : [translated] I want to express that every square meter of the Panama Canal and its adjacent areas belong to Panama and will continue to belong to Panama. The sovereignty and independence of our country are not negotiable.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Meanwhile, on Wednesday, Trump announced he's picking Trump loyalist, local official Kevin Marino Cabrera from Miami to serve as U.S. ambassador to Panama.\n\nFor more on this and Trump's vow to maybe also annex Canada, as he continually to refers to \"Governor Trudeau,\" and even a possible soft invasion of Mexico, we're joined by the Pulitzer Prize-winning author Greg Grandin, history professor at Yale University, his recent op-ed in The New York Times headlined \"The Republicans Who Want to Invade Mexico.\" His forthcoming book, America, América: A New History of the New World .\n\nThanks for joining us, Professor Grandin. First, your response to Panama?\n\nGREG GRANDIN : Well, Panama is interesting. I mean, I think there's a lot of things going on. Obviously, Trump is not president yet, and he's sending out messages that are meant to set a tone. In some ways, it's classic Trump. He's saber-rattling about these fantasies about taking back the canal. But I think the real kind of prosaic reason why he's doing that is to place, you know, single pressure on Panama to clamp down on immigration, and particularly to close down the Darién Gap. Last year, I believe the numbers are quite off the charts. Something like 400,000 migrants traipsed through the very narrow jungle Darién Gap as part of the migration into the United States. And by placing the pressure on Panama about the canal, this is Trump's way of, you know, bait and switch, in some ways.\n\nBut I think there are other things also going on. In some ways, it's distraction. The more we talk about Greenland, the more we talk about Canada and \"Governor Trudeau,\" and the more we talk about taking back the Panama Canal, the less we're talking about Syria or Gaza or, you know, these other hot spots that require significant attention and real diplomacy, rather than this kind of circus act.\n\nBut I also think that it also - it speaks to this signal shift in the global order. I think that, you know, the liberal - the old liberal order, multilateral order, that Trump stands apart and above from and has pledged to overthrow, you know, it presided over untold number of hypocrisies and atrocities. But at least the premise that it was founded on was that nations were to cooperate with each other to create a peaceful world, and hence diplomatic protocol. Trump, by just talking about taking the canal or taking Greenland or turning Canada into the 51st state, is really harkening back to a world where the doctrine of conquest still reigned, you know, where the presumption wasn't cooperation. The presumption was rivalry, competition and domination, in which smaller nations suffer what they must and bigger nations do what they will.\n\nAnd I think that, you know, this is classic - this is classic Trump. There's no way the United States is going to fill out greater America. This is red meat for the Trump base. If you go to Twitter, you can see all of these MAGA maps in which greater America is filled out from Greenland down to Panama. And it's a fantasy. There is not going to be a kind of return to territorial annexation in any significant way. I mean, the United States is not Israel, right? In Israel, there is a Greater Israel actually being created. In the United States, it exists more in the kind of fantasy life of his rank and file. And I think that some of that is what is going on.\n\nAnd let me just add, it's Panama. Panama is one of the largest offshore money-laundering shelters in the world. By some accounts, some $7 trillion exists in these offshore accounts. And if he really wanted to make America great again, he would go after not the Panama Canal or worry about immigration, he would shut down - he would shut down the ability of these offshore financing to function, and he would tax that money. And then we'd have high-speed trains. We'd have healthcare. We'd have a nation, as he likes to put it.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, just as we talked about Greenland and China and the U.S. interest in Greenland, what about the Panama Canal and the possibility of a larger canal being built through Nicaragua, and the role of China versus the U.S.? Is Trump seeing it in this context?\n\nGREG GRANDIN : I think, I mean, obviously, Latin America and its relationship with China is always a geostrategic concern for national security types. And it has been, and has been for quite a while. And in terms of the Panama Canal in particular, there are alternatives on the table. Claudia Sheinbaum in Mexico has talked about creating an interoceanic corridor, a combination of roadways and trains, in that thin kind of waistband area of Mexico, that would compete with the Panama Canal. Nicaragua, of course, is run by a degraded version of the Sandinistas, but they've been in talks with China. But this has been going on for decades, so it's unclear how real they were.\n\nThe thing about building alternatives to the Panama Canal is that this happens whenever - it's been going on for quite a long time, for at least a century, because, of course, the problem with the Panama Canal, it's not a - it's a lock canal. It's not a sea level canal. So it takes a long time to fill up the locks, bring them down, bring the ship across. And that's why the tariffs are so high. That's why the fees are so high. It's an enormous operation. So there's been a dream of a sea level canal for over a century. And maybe the will there is to build it either in Mexico or Nicaragua, but, you know, it's not anything I would hold my breath for, waiting to see happen. We'd probably have high-speed trains in the United States before that happened.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Interestingly, Trump's pick for the ambassador to Mexico is Ron Johnson, whose military career began in Panama. In the '80s, he was stationed in El Salvador as one of 55 U.S. military advisers as the Salvadoran military and paramilitaries were killing thousands of Salvadorans. He was a specialist in covert operations, became a member of the elite U.S. Special Forces, informally known as the Green Berets, a highly selective unit that also included figures like Trump's pick for national security adviser, Michael Waltz. He has pushed for the U.S. also invading Mexico, Greg, as we wrap up.\n\nGREG GRANDIN : Yeah, these are bad signs. Ron Johnson just brings us back to Iran-Contra, I mean, right into the heart of it. I mean, he was one of the so-called 55 military advisers on the ground in El Salvador while the United States was helping El Salvador build a death squad state. I mean, he's got - and then he had a career in the Green Berets and onward to the CIA . He's been - you know, he's seen some things. And to name him ambassador to Mexico is, again, sending a strong signal.\n\nAgain, Mexico is Mexico. It's stubborn. It has a strong commitment to sovereignty. On the other hand, it's poor, and it needs capital, and the United States is the largest trading partner. Claudia Sheinbaum seems to be very astute in not - you know, where we see obsequiousness on the part of Justin Trudeau, Sheinbaum has come back quite strongly, at least rhetorically, on Trump. But on the other hand, Mexico has cooperated with the United States on all sorts of things having to do with migration, and including helping the United States enforce a hard line on migration. I imagine that's going to continue, no matter what the rhetoric of Sheinbaum. But Mexico does have a - has a much stronger commitment to the idea of sovereignty because of the history, where, you know, you started talking about territorial annexation. I mean, a third of Mexico was lost to the United States. Texas was lost to the United States. The United States almost took the Yucatán in 1948 along with Texas - 1848, along with Texas. So, that history is there.\n\nAnd, of course, the people that Trump has put in, Marco Rubio as secretary of state, Ron Johnson, Mike Waltz, I mean, they might as well move the State Department down to Mar-a-Lago or down to Tampa. I mean, it's basically a Florida-based operation, which suggests that we're going to see a lot of interesting rivalries or a lot of interesting conflicts with Latin America, which will not necessarily be - which might reveal some big cleavages, because one of the things that the mathematic -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We just have 20 seconds, Greg.\n\nGREG GRANDIN : OK. One of the things that the Trump people want to do is build an alliance with right-wing Latin Americans. And you ain't gonna do that by threatening to take back the Panama Canal.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Yes, even The Wall Street Journal editorial page, well known for its conservatism, said, \"Trump, you did not campaign on this issue. Where is it coming from?\" Greg Grandin, Pulitzer Prize-winning author and professor of history at Yale University. We'll link your New York Times op-ed headlined \"The Republicans Who Want to Invade Mexico.\" We'll also link to Tracy Wilkerson's piece in The New York Times - Tracy Wilkinson's Los Angeles Times piece about Ron Johnson.\n\nNext up, we talk with longtime Silicon Valley venture capitalist Roger McNamee, author of Zucked: Waking Up to the Facebook Catastrophe , about the tech oligarchs. Back in 20 seconds.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Now, with the Trump administration's actions, buttressed by a servile Congress under Republican control, fossil-fuel megaprojects are getting the green light.\n\nBut it will take more than the stroke of Trump's pen to quash the vigorous resistance to these two pipelines, or the growing global demand for urgent action to combat climate change.\n\nThe Dakota Access Pipeline ( DAPL ) is the 1,100-mile long, $3.8 billion pipeline that would carry fracked oil from the Bakken oil fields in North Dakota, through South Dakota and Iowa to Illinois, where it would connect with another pipeline to carry the crude to the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nOpponents of DAPL fear a pipeline rupture could poison the Missouri River, which provides fresh water for 17 million people. The center of opposition has been at protest camps on and around the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, where the pipeline is slated to cross the river.\n\nThe proposed Keystone XL ( KXL ) pipeline would carry the world's filthiest fossil fuels, tar sand bitumen, from Alberta, Canada, across the border into the U.S., also down to the Gulf. On Nov. 6, 2015, after five years of protest against the KXL , President Barack Obama stated that it \"would not serve the national interest of the United States,\" effectively killing the project. On Dec. 5, 2016, in a second victory for grass-roots environmental activists, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers denied the easement for DAPL to tunnel underneath the Missouri River, stopping that pipeline.\n\n\"Trump's executive order on DAPL violates the law and tribal treaties. We will be taking legal action,\" Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Chairman David Archambault II said in a press release after Trump's actions. \"Creating a second Flint does not make America great again.\" Trump's presidential memorandum on DAPL instructs the secretary of the Army to \"review and approve in an expedited manner ... requests for approvals to construct and operate the DAPL .\" The same language in the memo about the Keystone XL pipeline is addressed to the secretary of the Army, as well as to the secretary of state and the secretary of the interior. Trump's secretary of state nominee, Rex Tillerson, was formerly the CEO of ExxonMobil, a company that would reap enormous profit from exploitation of Canadian tar sands oil. Trump's energy secretary nominee, Rick Perry, was until recently on the board of Energy Transfer Partners, the owner of DAPL .\n\nTrump's executive order, \"Expediting Environmental Reviews and Approvals For High Priority Infrastructure Projects,\" released alongside the two memoranda, includes the claim that \"too often, infrastructure projects in the United States have been routinely and excessively delayed by agency processes and procedures.\" Along with a fourth memo demanding-without the force of law-that pipeline construction and repair projects \"use materials and equipment produced in the United States,\" this flurry of fiats sets the stage for the fast-tracked revival of both pipelines.\n\n\"It is pretty much a declaration of war against us all out here, not just against Native people, but against anybody who wants to drink water,\" Winona LaDuke, Native American activist and executive director of the group Honor the Earth, told us on the \"Democracy Now!\" news hour. \"He definitely wants to shove those pipelines down our throats.\"\n\nBobbi Jean Three Legs, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux Nation, began protesting DAPL before the first resistance camp was set up last April. She helped lead a 2,000-mile relay run for native youth, from the Sacred Stone Camp in Cannon Ball, N.D., to Washington, D.C., to draw attention to their struggle against the pipeline. \"Water is Life\" is their guiding principle, \"Mni Wiconi\" [minny wah-chonee] in the Lakota language. \"He is waking up a lot of people. A lot of people are really paying attention to the climate change now,\" Bobbi told us on \"Democracy Now!.\" \"We're never going to back down.\"\n\nBobbi Jean Three Legs and Winona LaDuke worry about increased violence from the police and National Guard. Bobbi described the situation: \"There's still police brutality going on. People are still getting maced. They're getting shot. ... There's over 600 people that have been arrested so far, and it just keeps going up.\" Her eyes welled up. \"Right now I'm just asking all the youth around the country to stand up. I'm asking everyone around the world to stand up with us, wherever you are ... I'm afraid that they're out to kill.\"\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

      "text": "You turn to us for voices you won't hear anywhere else.\n\nSign up for Democracy Now!'s Daily Digest to get our latest headlines and stories delivered to your inbox every day.\n\nDonald Trump has made the mass deportation of immigrants a centerpiece of his plans for a second term, vowing to forcibly remove as many as 20 million people from the country. Historian Ana Raquel Minian, who studies the history of immigration, says earlier mass deportation programs in the 1930s and '50s led to widespread abuse, tearing many families apart through violent means that also resulted in the expulsion of many U.S. citizens. \"These deportations that Trump is claiming that he will do will have mass implications to our civil rights, to our communities and to our economy, and of course to the people who are being deported themselves,\" says Minian. She also says that while Trump's extremist rhetoric encourages hate and violence against vulnerable communities, in terms of policy there is great continuity with the Biden administration, which kept many of the same policies in place.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, \"War, Peace and the Presidency.\" I'm Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : We end today's show looking at Donald Trump's threat to deport as many as 20 million immigrants living in the United States. It's a threat he repeated on an almost daily basis on the campaign trail, including at the Republican National Convention.\n\nDONALD TRUMP : That's why, to keep our families safe, the Republican platform promises to launch the largest deportation operation in the history of our country, even larger than that of President Dwight D. Eisenhower from many years ago. You know, he was a moderate, but he believed very strongly in borders. He had the largest deportation operation we've ever had.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We're joined right now by a historian who's closely studied past mass deportation programs in the United States. Ana Raquel Minian is an associate professor of history at Stanford University and the author of In the Shadow of Liberty: The Invisible History of Immigrant Detention in the United States Their recent piece for Dissent magazine is titled \"Trump's Deportation Model.\"\n\nSo, Professor Minian, if you can start off by talking about Trump's victory, what that model is, and, you know, his famous motto, \"Make America great again\"? Go back in history and talk about the mass deportations of people in the United States.\n\nANA RAQUEL MINIAN : Thank you.\n\nIn many ways, we think that Trump is a new model, a person who completely goes against the grain of American history in terms of deportations, in terms of his treatment of immigrants. But as he noted himself, that is absolutely not true.\n\nWhat he was referring to when he spoke about Eisenhower was an operation that occurred in 1954 titled Operation Wetback. And this was a massive deportation campaign. The tactics were military tactics. They brought tanks. They brought Border Patrol people all throughout the border, airplanes. People were grabbed from their houses and taken to the border, stopped outside of their jobs and taken to the border. Their families didn't know where they had been. It was a very cruel operation. In the year 1954, the year of Operation Wetback, over 1 million people were deported. And this is the model that Trump says that he is going to expand.\n\nAnd it comes at huge costs to America, to its communities and to the people themselves. In the United States, when Operation Wetback happened, communities were destroyed. People were left without central members, without churchgoers, without breadwinners. Families came to [inaudible]. Families who relied on some of the folks who were deported had to either rely on welfare or find jobs immediately. Children were left without parents. Many jobs, many employers needed workers who were deported. It was bad for the U.S. economy. It was also bad for American civil rights. Many Mexican Americans, people who were born in the United States, could be walking through the streets and considered to be Mexican just because they, quote-unquote, \"looked Mexican,\" and their civil rights were not protected. Their constitutional rights were not protected.\n\nThe deportation of American citizens is something that we have seen over and over again. For example, in the 1930s, there was also a massive deportation campaign against Mexicans. It occurred, of course, during the Great Depression. We estimate that from 350,000 to a million people were deported and that over 60% of those were American citizens. These deportations that Trump is claiming that he will do will have mass implications to our civil rights, to our communities and to our economy, and of course to the people who are being deported themselves.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : And if you could explain? If you could put that in the context of more recent history? In other words, how does Trump's proposal - or, in fact, what is actual policies that he implemented in the four years he was in power, from 2016 - on immigration, how do they compare with what the Biden administration did and what Kamala Harris said herself, since it was also central to her, immigration border security was also central to her campaign?\n\nANA RAQUEL MINIAN : Absolutely. In many ways, the Biden administration also led an extremely anti-immigrant movement. His administration first continued the \"return to Mexico\" policy, continued Title 42. What did these policies do? These policies meant that either asylum seekers could not even apply for asylum in the United States, even though asylum is something that we abide to because of our own national law and because of international agreements, and it said that - and the \"Remain in Mexico\" policy said that if we were to accept asylum seekers to apply for asylum, they had to wait while their cases were adjudicated in northern Mexico. While people waited in northern Mexico for either Title 42 to go away or for the \"Remain in Mexico\" policy to be allowed in, people lived in terrible encampments where they were regularly raped, tortured, mugged. It was absolutely brutal, the conditions there. In fact, I once interviewed a woman who had fostered a child during Trump's zero-tolerance policy, the policy that Trump implemented that separated children from their parents while in detention. And this woman, who had fostered one of these little kids who was separated from his father while crossing the border because of the Trump administration, said, \"Right now the Biden administration's 'Remain in Mexico' policy is basically a zero-tolerance policy in reverse.\" Why? The conditions in northern Mexico were so brutal that some parents made the heart-wrenching decision of sending their children across the border, because unaccompanied minors were the only ones who could get into the United States while their parents had to wait in northern Mexico. Even recently, the Biden campaign has dramatically reduced the number of asylum seekers who can come into the country. These policies have been devastating to asylum seekers and migrants.\n\nBut there is, I believe, a big difference between what Trump did and what Biden did, even if not so much numerically. The rhetoric that Trump implemented, the anti-immigrant discourse, calling Mexicans \"animals,\" all Central Americans as belonging to MS-13, calling people rapists, that is not something that we heard so much from the Biden administration or from Kamala Harris's campaign. And that rhetoric matters. That rhetoric leads to violence in Latino communities, and eventually it also pushes people, administrations, to move further and further toward anti-immigrant policies. Additionally, Trump's family separation policy was explicitly created for purposes of deterrence. What does this mean? Trump implemented the zero-tolerance policy to cause harm to asylum seekers in order to warn other asylum seekers not to try to come into the United States. The very purpose of this policy was to cause harm. This is different from the policies that Biden has implemented and that Kamala Harris promised to implement, as well, even though they, too, would have created massive harm.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : And if you could say, given all of that, especially what you said the distinctions are between Kamala and Biden and Trump - you know, so many exit polls have found, across the board, there was an increase in the number of votes for Trump, and obviously Latinx community is a massive and highly diverse community, but among this community, however defined, there was also an increase in the number of people who voted for Trump. How do you understand that?\n\nANA RAQUEL MINIAN : I do want to emphasize your first point, which is: Why are we even thinking of a Latinx community when we think of votes? We know, for example, that Cubans have regularly voted Republican, that Mexicans have switched back and forth. So, I have been a little disturbed by this concept of a Latinx community and the blame that has been put on this community for the election of Trump nowadays.\n\nBut there is a history that we must understand. For example, if we look at the Mexican American community, right now the biggest Latinx community is of Mexicans. And Mexicans have changed - Mexican Americans have changed their views around migration many times. Up until the 1970s, most Mexican Americans viewed immigrants as a huge problem. Why? When immigrants arrived in the United States, they were cast as bringing disease, bringing crime - just like nowadays. And so, Mexican Americans had an option. One of these options was to say, \"Look, we are not them. We don't want them here. If they don't come, we won't be stereotyped as criminals. We won't be stereotyped as bringing in disease. Stop them from coming.\" So this was a very common speech and rhetoric of the Mexican American community up until the 1970s. This type of rhetoric began to change -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We have 10 seconds.\n\nANA RAQUEL MINIAN : - because of the civil rights movement - because of the civil rights movement of the 1960s, when Mexican Americans said, \"Actually, these people are our brethren. We are still being discriminated. Instead of stopping their discrimination - instead of fighting for them not to come, let us say they should not be discriminated, either.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Ana Raquel Minian, we have to leave it there, and we thank you so much for being with us, associate professor of history at Stanford University, author of In the Shadow of Liberty: The Invisible History of Immigrant Detention in the United States . I'm Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

      "text": "Trump's third term trial balloon: how extremist ideas become mainstream\n\nThe president has been testing the waters by suggesting he could run again, a familiar playbook of the Maga movement - and a distraction tactic\n\nI t is noon on 20 January 2029. In the biting cold of Washington DC , thousands of people are gathered on the national mall to witness the swearing in of a new US president or, more accurately, an old US president: Donald Trump , aged 82, starting his third term in office.\n\nThe scene is the realm of fantasy or, for millions of Americans, the stuff of nightmares. But in the president's own mind it is apparently not so far-fetched at all. Last weekend he told an interviewer that he is \"not joking\" about another run and there are \"methods\" to circumvent the constitution, which limits presidents to two terms.\n\nFor longtime Trump watchers it smacked of a familiar playbook of the American right and the Maga movement. Float a trial balloon, no matter how wacky or extreme. Let far-right media figures such as Steve Bannon make the case it's not so outlandish because, after all, Democrats are worse. Stand by as Republicans in Congress avoid then equivocate then actively endorse. Watch a fringe idea slowly but surely normalised.\n\n\"One of the most important lessons of the last decade is the way that ideas have migrated from the fever swamp into the mainstream,\" said Charlie Sykes , a conservative author and broadcaster. \"How Steve Bannon will say some crazy thing only to see it become Republican orthodoxy a few years later. We've seen that migration of ideas that seem absurd and are perhaps dismissed but develop a constituency .\"\n\nThis one is a long shot. The constitution's 22nd amendment , ratified in 1951, clearly states: \"No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.\" Legal experts and constitutional scholars firmly reject any credible legal basis for a third term.\n\nYet for months Trump, who began his first term in 2017 and his second in 2025, has been testing the water by suggesting that he could run again anyway. Initially treated by some as jokes or political manoeuvering, the comments have recently moved beyond veiled suggestions to become more explicit.\n\nAsked whether he wanted another term, Trump told NBC News : \"I like working. I'm not joking. But I'm not - it is far too early to think about it.\" Pressed on whether he has seen plans to enable him to seek a third term, the president replied: \"There are methods which you could do it.\"\n\nNone of these \"methods\" is straightforward. Trump could try to whip up political support to repeal the 22nd amendment. But the procedural and political difficulties of amending the constitution make this extremely unlikely. Democratic-led states could also refuse to put Trump on the ballot.\n\nWendy Schiller , a political science professor at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island: \"The technical hurdle is very high. Given the political configuration now, and the control of state legislatures now, it would be impossible not only to repeal the 22nd amendment but to get him on the ballot in all 50 states.\"\n\nSome argue that a constitutional loophole allows JD Vance to run for president with Trump as vice-president. Once elected, Vance would hand over power, much as Russia's Dmitry Medvedev handed back the keys to the Kremlin to Vladimir Putin. But experts say this would violate the 12th amendment's requirement that the vice-president be constitutionally eligible for president.\n\nAlternatively and most simply, Trump could run for president again and gamble that the supreme court, which contains six conservatives including three Trump appointees, would not stop him. Time and again over the past decade, he has crashed through barriers through brute willpower.\n\nNone of it seems likely, but then nor did a reality TV star with no political or military experience winning election, nor did the instigator of the January 6 insurrection maintaining his grip on the Republican party, and nor did a man with 34 felony counts of falsified business records returning to the White House .\n\nSykes, the author of How the Right Lost Its Mind , commented: \"My instinct is to to regard it as a distraction but that's a mistake because the opposition has suffered from a lack of imagination on occasion of what Donald Trump is capable of doing and what he intends to do. Clearly he's putting this out to soften the ground. \"\n\nOnce unthinkable ideas have a habit of becoming very unthinkable in the Trump era. In the immediate aftermath of the US Capitol riot, Republican leaders moved to distance themselves from Trump and his \"big lie\" of a stolen election. Senator Lindsey Graham declared : \"All I can say is count me out, enough is enough.\"\n\nBut Bannon and other rightwing influencers worked tirelessly to promote Trump's false claims of voter fraud. Before long Republicans were rallying around Trump again, suggesting that he was right to raise concerns over election integrity and dismissing a congressional panel that investigated January 6 as a witch hunt. Last year a CNN poll found that 69% of Republicans sayJoe Biden's win was not legitimate.\n\nSykes noted another recent example: presidential ally Elon Musk suggesting that federal judges who rule against the Trump administration be impeached. Now opinion polls suggest that a majority of Republican voters are in favour of the move.\n\nSykes added: \"If Donald Trump keeps putting this idea out there, there's no reason to believe that he can't get Maga [the Make America great again movement] behind him and then the question is whether the courts would go along with it. What happens if the court says, no, you can't serve another term, but enough states put him on the ballot anyway? Who's going to stop him?\"\n\nTrump's third-term talk may also be a strategy to maintain political relevance and influence, wrongfooting opponents by keeping them guessing. It prevents him from being seen as a \"lame duck\" president and keeps the spotlight on him rather than his potential successors.\n\nThe comments could also serve to deflect attention from other controversies. Perhaps it was no coincidence that Trump mused about a third term in the same week that his administration had been rocked by a scandal over senior officials accidentally inviting a journalist into a Signal group chat about military attack plans.\n\nSign up to This Week in Trumpland\n\nA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nSome Republicans are downplaying Trump's remarks as jokes or simply an effort to \"get people talking\". The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, stated: \"It's not really something we're thinking about. He has four years. There's a lot of work to do.\"\n\nBut the issue is gaining traction on the right. Just three days after Trump was sworn in on 20 January, Republican representative Andy Ogles proposed a House of Representatives joint resolution to amend the constitution so that a president can serve up to three terms - provided that they did not serve two consecutive terms before running for a third (this would continue to bar Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Barack Obama from running again).\n\nAt this year's Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland, Bannon proclaimed, \"We want Trump in 28,\" and argued forcefully for a constitutional change. The case was also put by Third Term Project , a thinktank exploring presidential term limits, with a logo portraying Trump as Julius Caesar.\n\nRick Wilson , a co-founder of the Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump, has seen this movie before. \"It starts out as ha-ha, Trump is trolling the libs, and then it's well, Trump is trolling the libs but he's got a good point. Well, he's got a good point and the Democrats are so evil we should set aside any restraint to pursue this idea. Then it's why aren't you getting in line with this idea, every Republican?\"\n\nWilson added: \"That arc is a known pattern now with Trump. Remember January 6. Every Republican - almost - came out and condemned that the day it happened and the idea became less and less defensible the more we knew about Trump's role in it. But they became less and less willing to speak the truth. They became less and less willing to to resist and so I think that pattern is real, it exists, it's been visible to us for a long time.\"\n\nDemocrats are moving to counter Trump's remarks and Ogles' proposed resolution. Congressman Dan Goldman has introduced resolutions reaffirming support for the 22nd amendment.\n\nHe told the MSNBC network : \"I've unfortunately been spending enough time studying Donald Trump to know that he's not a comedian. He doesn't joke and he has a very set MO, which is to float a crazy idea, claim that he's joking, have some sycophantic Republicans start to run with it, like in this case, Representative Ogles, and then all of a sudden it becomes normalized and socialised.\"\n\nThe two-term standard began when America's first president, George Washington, voluntarily stepped down. Four of the next six presidents won a second term but passed on a third. In 1940 Franklin Roosevelt became the only president to successfully win a third election, couching his decision as one of necessity, not ambition, during the second world war. Roosevelt won again in 1944 but died the following year.\n\nNot long after, Congress began discussion of what became the 22nd amendment, limiting presidents to two elections, and ratified it in 1951. There has been occasional talk of repealing it since. Ronald Reagan , another two-term president, publicly supported repeal, telling an interviewer that he \"wouldn't do that for myself, but for presidents from here on\".\n\nTrump, however, has shown no qualms about grabbing power for himself, claiming that the public demands it because he has the highest poll numbers of any Republican for the past 100 years. Asked this week about a hypothetical showdown with Obama in 2028, he replied: \"I'd love that, boy, I'd love that.\"\n\nSome observers note that Trump's approval rating is already on the slide. Elaine Kamarck , a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington, insisted: \"This is not a serious effort. This is an effort to make Donald Trump into the most powerful politician that ever happened. The guy is not God. He will fall to the normal rhythms of politics. He'll lose the midterms in 2026 and then people will be sick of the guy. \"\n\nOthers, however, warn that Trump has been written off to easily before. Joe Walsh , a former Republican congressman from Illinois, said: \"This is no joke and no distraction. It needs to be taken seriously. Trump just saying, 'Fuck it I'm running' and daring people, the party, the media, the military, the courts, to stop him - I don't know that he could be stopped.\n\n\"It's been an utter failure of imagination to be prepared for how far this guy will go. People never thought January 6 will happen; we never thought a president would try to overthrow an election. A guy who would do that, if he wanted to, would try to do anything to stay in office and run again.\""

      "text": "America's Brexit? Trump's historic gamble on tariffs has been decades in the making\n\nTrump's economic assault on the world stunned economists and sent stock markets into a spiral. Who will pay the price?\n\nDonald Trump 's vast overhaul of US trade policy this week has called time on an era of globalization, alarming people , governments and investors around the world. No one should have been surprised, the US president said.\n\nThe announcement of 10% to 50% tariffs on US trading partners tanked stock markets after Trump unveiled a \"declaration of economic independence\" so drastic it drew comparison with Britain's exit from the European Union - Brexit .\n\nBut Trump, who won re-election promising that tariffs would make America great again, has advocated for the return of widespread tariffs with \"great consistency\" for decades. \"I've been talking about it for 40 years,\" he noted in the White House Rose Garden.\n\nMany businesses , economists and politicians believe Trump's trade plan is wrongheaded, flawed and risky. Some have even suggested it might have been written by ChatGPT . But he is unquestionably right when it comes to the number of decades he has argued for it.\n\n\"This is so unusual for Trump. He's a conventional politician in one way: he doesn't believe in much deeply,\" Larry Sabato, the director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. Tariffs are different. \"This one thing, he seems to deeply believe in.\"\n\nAs far back as 1987, when a fame-hungry real estate tycoon took out full-page ads in newspapers , the now president called for such a strategy. Other major economies are the \"greatest profit machines ever created\", he argued way back when. \"'Tax' these wealthy nations, not America.\"\n\nEight years after the start of his first term and just 10 weeks into his second, he has finally set about seriously delivering that dream - and cast aside warnings it may deteriorate into a nightmare.\n\nOn the campaign trail last year, Trump made no secret of his vision: tariffs would unshackle the US economy , he promised, revitalize its industrial heartlands and unlock a gigantic financial windfall for the federal government.\n\nBut after pitching this big, beautiful and bold reconstruction of the global economic order, the early actions of the second Trump administration were strikingly smaller, messier and altogether more hesitant than trailed.\n\nThe focus, at first, narrowed dramatically from the world to just a handful of nations : China, Canada and Mexico. While China was hit hard, sweeping tariffs on Canada and Mexico were interrupted by a dizzying array of deadlines, delays and dispensations.\n\nTariffs were increased on steel and aluminum . But Trump's trade agenda was largely characterized by threats and spats: rhetoric but not reality.\n\nOn Wednesday, dubbed \"liberation day\" by Trump and his aides, he did his best to draw a sharp line under weeks of wavering, doubt and confusion - and imposed the universal and \"reciprocal\" tariffs he pledged so many times to introduce while fighting to regain the White House.\n\nDefying the stark forecasts and concerns of mainstream economists and corporations, Trump went with his gut. \"That was true of the Brexiteers, was it not? They really believed it deeply from the core of their souls,\" said Sabato.\n\nAt one point during his address, Trump switched from president to historian. \"In 1913, for reasons unknown to mankind, they established the income tax,\" he said, setting the stage for a sharp reduction in tariffs on foreign goods. \"Citizens, rather than foreign countries, would start paying the money necessary to run our government.\"\n\nDecades of US prosperity \"came to a very abrupt end\" with the Great Depression from 1929, Professor Trump opined before his class of aides, cabinet secretaries and supporters. \"It would have never happened if they had stayed with the tariff policy,\" he claimed. \"It would have been a much different story.\"\n\nActual historians took issue with this account. \"It's what we would call a lie. False. Not true,\" said Andrew Cohen, a professor of history in the Maxwell School at Syracuse University. \"He's wrong. No one thinks that. Even conservative economists don't think that. Even protectionist economists don't think that.\"\n\nMonths into the depression, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 - which hiked tariffs on hundreds of imports in a bid to boost the US economy - is widely considered to have prolonged, and even deepened, the crisis. No other president has tried the same tactic again - until now.\n\nThe swift rebuttal to Trump's analysis of the past was surpassed only by the response to his ambitious predictions for the future.\n\nThe president has promised a new Golden Age, with millions of new jobs, billions more dollars' worth of US exports and trillions of dollars in tariff revenues. Outside his administration, skepticism is high.\n\n\"The Trump tariffs mark a liberation from the benefits of free trade for American businesses and consumers,\" said Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University, and a former official at the International Monetary Fund. \"Trump has taken the hatchet to trade with practically every major US trading partner, sparing few allies or rivals,\" he added, with action that will be \"severely disruptive to the US economy, with the effects felt by American consumers and businesses in practically every industry\".\n\nWho pays the price? The rest of the world, according to the president and his aides. But import tariffs are paid by the companies and consumers that import the goods from the rest of the world - in this case, US companies and consumers - rather than the overseas companies exporting them.\n\nTrump's tariffs will increase the average US household's costs by $3,800, according to the Yale Budget Lab.\n\n\"These tariff increases are likely to be some of the biggest tax increases in US history and will result (if fully implemented) in some of the highest tariff rates the US has ever seen,\" wrote Jeremy Horpedahl, an adjunct scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute, who noted that they could exceed the post-Smoot-Hawley levels of 1930.\n\n\"Like all tariffs, some large portion of these new levies will be paid by US consumers and businesses in the form of higher prices,\" added Horpedahl.\n\nIf Trump is right, and his decades-old dream revives the world's largest economy, enriching its citizens and transforming its industrial base into a manufacturing powerhouse, his administration will be one of the most successful in modern memory.\n\nBut if he's wrong, the very Americans who elected him to rapidly bring down the cost of living are likely to be hit hardest.\n\n\"It's either going to be Trump and his team or it's going to be a large majority of experienced mainstream economists,\" said Sabato. \"I know where my bet is.\""

      "text": "Trump embraces role of demagogue on divine mission to reshape America\n\nThe president cast himself as a holy warrior in a speech that made 2017's 'American carnage' theme seem almost innocent\n\nH e is risen. After dodging an assassin's bullet and the prospect of jail, Donald Trump staged a political resurrection like no other. On Monday, as he returned to power, he embraced the role of a demagogue on a divine mission.\n\nSworn in as the 47th US president at the US Capitol in Washington, Trump delivered an inaugural address that cast himself as a holy warrior and made his \" American carnage \" speech from 2017 seem almost innocent.\n\nThe first convicted criminal to take the oath of office channeled eight years of grievance and retribution to roast his predecessor, Joe Biden , sitting just feet away, as both his biological family and adopted family - the tech billionaire boys - looked on.\n\nAnd in setting out a far-right populist agenda that spanned the border, the classroom and the rapidly heating planet, he reached for the oldest and most ominous political armour.\n\n\"My life was saved for a reason,\" he said, recalling how he survived an assassination attempt by inches at a campaign rally on a Pennsylvania field last year. \"I was saved by God to make America great again ... For American citizens, January 20, 2025 is liberation day.\"\n\nThe speech quickly dispelled notions that Trump might be older, wiser and more unifying this time, that the dire warnings of the election campaign, in which his own former officials branded him a fascist, were just hype in the heat of political battle.\n\nThe only bipartisan thing about Trump on Monday was his purple checked tie and opening promise of \"the golden age of America\". Vice-President JD Vance , whose swearing in by conservative supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh was another \"owning the libs\" moment, wore a tie of familiar Maga red.\n\nThe rotunda is a big, domed circular room located in the centre of the US Capitol designed to recall the Pantheon, the ancient Roman temple. It is decorated filled with gold-framed historical paintings and marble statues of his past presidents.\n\nAs Trump stood at the presidential lectern, to his right were first lady Melania Trump, his adult children and the faces of the tech industrial complex: Elon Musk of Tesla, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Apple's Tim Cook, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Google's Sundar Pichai.\n\nTo the president's left were the old guard. Biden, already shrivelled by loss of power, like an old king reduced to a commoner, spent much of the speech with hand over mouth as if trying not to vomit as his legacy crumbled before his eyes. Next to him was the outgoing vice-president Kamala Harris , wearing funereal black and working hard to maintain a poker face. Behind them Doug Emhoff, former president Barack Obama, who was Michelle-less , and the Clintons and Bushes.\n\nLike the ultimate fight nights Trump relishes, the ex-presidents and first ladies' presence made a spectacle of political gore, cruelty and pain. The group remained riveted to their seats almost every time Trump delivered an applause line that brought everyone else to their feet in rapturous applause.\n\nThe new president, who once faced four criminal cases and was convicted in one of them, insisted: \"Never again will the immense power of the state be weaponized to persecute political opponents.\"\n\nHe went on: \"As we gather today our government confronts a crisis of trust. For many years, a radical and corrupt establishment has extracted power and wealth from our citizens while the pillars of our society lay broken and seemingly in complete disrepair.\"\n\nThese were striking words from a man who has appointed Musk , the world's richest man, to slash government funding and brought other tech masters of the universe into his orbit. But Trumpism has always been about making brash, blunt and blatant the forces shaping society for years. An oligarchy has long held sway in America. He is now elevating it without apology or shame.\n\nCiting hurricanes and fires, Trump again delivered a made-for-TV roast of his predecessor by stating: \"We now have a government that cannot manage a single crisis at home. All of this will change starting today, and it will change very quickly.\" He added: \"My recent election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal taking place and to give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy and indeed their freedom.\"\n\nTrump vowed: \"From this moment on, America's decline is over.\"\n\nHe strayed into the territory of his rally speeches, bemoaning dangerous criminals who escaped from mental institutions invading the country, although there was to be no historic first mention of Hannibal Lecter in an inaugural address.\n\nTrump castigated the former administration for refusing to defend America's borders. His promise to declare national emergencies at the border, and over energy policy (\"We will drill, baby, drill \"), received more standing ovations.\n\nWading into the culture wars, Trump declared that as of today it will be official government policy that there are only two genders: male and female. That got one of the biggest cheers of the day among Trump supporters watching on big screens at a downtown Washington sports arena.\n\nWhat could the rest of the world be making of it all? It knows this face of America has always been there, sometimes in the shadows, sometimes in the sun. Its 47th president insisted that his \"proudest legacy will be one of a peacemaker and unifier\" and then proceeded to announce that the Gulf of Mexico would be renamed the Gulf of America (Hillary Clinton laughed at that). As for the Panama canal, \" we're taking it back \".\n\nWith another flourish, Trump promised to plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars. A delighted Musk, owner of SpaceX, grinned from ear to ear, evidently delighted by the prospect of more squillion-dollar government contracts. There was a huge roar from a crowd of 20,000 at the sports arena.\n\nThe watch party was happening because the inauguration, traditionally held on the US Capitol steps, had been moved inside because of forecasts of frigid weather . As it transpired, this was probably unnecessary: the temperature was 27F (-3C) and Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania still turned up in his trademark shorts.\n\nStill, Trump dodged having a small crowd that he would have to pretend was bigger than Obama's in 2009. That was the among the first lies of some 30,000 during his first term, according to the Washington Post's factcheckers.\n\nBeing inside Capital One Arena - draped with basketball and ice hockey championship pennants - felt like being inside Trump's id as the day's solemn ceremonies unfolded. It was a gaudy pageant with the words \"60th presidential inauguration\" emblazoned in red and gold on electronic displays and golden oldies booming from loudspeakers, which made for some bizarre juxtapositions.\n\nThe image of Biden and Trump walking a red carpet from the White House entrance to a waiting limousine was accompanied by the suitably retro December, 1963 (Oh What a Night) by Frankie Valli & the Four Seasons. When the camera cut to a close-up of former New York mayor Rudi Giuliani, the crowd roared.\n\nThe motorcade to the US Capitol was accompanied by the sound of Brown Eyed Girl by Van Morrison. As Trump entered the building with wind-blown hair, the supporters cheered again. Cut to Musk: another cheer. Cut to Vivek Ramaswamy: another cheer.\n\nBut there were loud boos for Bill and Hillary Clinton as Sweet Caroline by Neil Diamond played over the sound system, the crowd joining on, \"so good, so good\". Comedian Trevor Noah has joked that the song is the one thing that white people love more than anything else on the planet.\n\nThen Mr Blue Sky by the Electric Light Orchestra boomed as Barack Obama walked in to more boos. Former vice-president Mike Pence, who defied Trump's entreaties to overturn the 2020 election, suffered a similar fate. When George W Bush, a former Republican president, appeared on screen, someone started cheering, only to be drowned out by boos - a neat metaphor for the party's ongoing identity crisis.\n\nThe booing reached a crescendo when the giant screens showed Biden and Harris walking the shiny floor of the Capitol as if it were the Boulevard of Broken Dreams, or perhaps the Boulevard of Broken Democracies.\n\nThen cheers erupted at the sight of Trump walking through the Capitol and entering the rotunda, where he clasped the hand of his nominee for homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, and tried to kiss Melania but couldn't get past the expansive brim of her hat. The sports arena erupted with chants of \"USA! USA!\"\n\nTrump was duly sworn in on the spot where a violent mob of his supporters marauded on 6 January 2021. He pointed a playful finger at Chief Justice John Roberts and shook his hand. He turned and shook Biden's hand and appeared to say: \"Thank you, Joe.\"\n\nAnd in that moment Trump's rise from the political dead was complete. Before offering a prayer, under the gaze of a bust of Martin Luther King, Christian evangelist Franklin Graham had reflected: \"Mr President, I'm sure there were times the last four years when you thought it was pretty dark. But look what God has done.\"\n\nLook on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!\n\nRead more of the Guardian's Trump coverage\n\nAll of the Trump executive orders and speech fact checks\n\nExperts alarmed by Trumps' crypto meme coins\n\nElon Musk appears to make back-to-back fascist salutes\n\nWhat is birthright citizenship?\n\nThis article was amended on 20 January 2025 to remove an incorrect statement that Donald Trump placed his hand on a Bible when he was sworn in."

      "text": "Donald Trump assumes office with promise to be the very bestest best\n\nGod spared him to make America great again. Rejoice oilmen and climate change deniers, but immigrants watch out\n\nT hey came in dribs and drabs, the unwanted, the uninvited and the unloved. First to arrive in Washington was Liz Truss, wearing a red Maga hat and a bright blue coat looking like an extra in a Paddington Bear film.\n\nLizzie could be found standing on a street corner in downtown DC, screaming: \"I used to be prime minister of the United Kingdom.\"\n\n\"Of course you did,\" said a kindly passerby, giving her a wide berth.\n\n\"I did. I did. I really did,\" she sobbed.\n\n\"Do you need help?\"\n\n\"I'm fine. I'm fine. Anyone who says I crashed the economy will be getting a letter from my lawyers.\"\n\n\"It's OK, Ma'am,\" said a police officer. \"Time to move on. Do you have anywhere to go?\"\n\nLizzie didn't. She wasn't quite sure why she had come to America now. When even Donald Trump doesn't want to know you, then your sense of futility is complete. Maybe she could find an electrical goods store and watch the inauguration on a TV there.\n\nThe same went for Suella Braverman and Priti Patel. No place to go, no place to be. They had only come because they had hoped they were marginally more popular in the US than they were back at home. Priti had been sure that being found to have broken the ministerial code twice would guarantee her a front row seat. Turns out The Donald had some standards after all. Suella had even turned up on the same flight as the freelance halfwit Laurence Fox. Hard to tell who was the most embarrassed.\n\nBack in the UK, the sucking up started early on Monday morning. David Lammy on the Today programme trying to be cool about not getting an invitation. He was sure it had just been a clash of diaries. And hadn't wanted to upstage the president-elect anyway. He went into rhapsodies about the brilliance of The Donald, the extended dinner that had been the best dinner ever, the incredible grace and generosity of the Trumpster. Words no one had ever previously said. Least of all the foreign secretary, who last we heard had called him a fascist. Pass the sick bag.\n\nIt was a bitterly cold morning in DC. Something every reporter remarked on. Minus 11, said the Sky man on the White House lawn. He sounded as if he felt he had drawn the short straw. How come he wasn't anchoring the show from a warm studio? Or doing the commentary from the Rotunda?\n\nThe first real action was a sighting of Trump going to a prayer service at St John's Episcopal church. Donald didn't look exactly thrilled to be there. Then he seldom does when he's with Melania. Joining him in the congregation was Javier Milei, Argentina's answer to Liam Gallagher, Elon Musk and Boris Johnson. This was a real moment of hubris for Bozza. The Donald was born again while he couldn't even give away copies of his memoir. The service lasted 45 minutes. There were a lot of collective sins to be forgiven.\n\nCut to JD Vance and his wife Usha being greeted at the White House by Kamala Harris and her husband Doug. Awkward smiles. No love lost there. Moments later the Beeb screened a ticker: Rump family arriving at Capitol Hill. Start as you mean to go on, BBC. Cue Donald and Melania meeting the Bidens. Perhaps they chatted about why Trump had chosen to post a video about Joe having spent the night in the seniors' wing. That legendary generosity again. Still no smile from the Donald.\n\nAn hour before the ceremony began, the Rotunda started to fill with guests. There was Musk. As weird as only he can be. Friends, politicians, judges and ambassadors. But no Nigel Farage. Maybe not on quite such good terms with the president as he would like us to believe. George Bush and Bill Clinton were there with their wives. Barack Obama without his. The extended Trump family looking surprised to have been given day release. The ceremonials didn't come close to a British state occasion. More like the political Oscars complete with cheesy announcer.\n\nAfter a long procession of entrances, we finally got to Trump himself. The first flicker of a smile. He and Melania went to air-kiss. Their lips didn't get within six inches of each other . Then the opening addresses. A reminder that \"equal justice under the law\" was written on the supreme court. Just not for presidents. Or the very rich.\n\nFranklin Graham declared that God had spared Trump to save the country. At least we will know who to blame. The Donald swore the oath on his own bible. The one that says \"may all felons be spared\" and \"grab women by the pussy\". America had its 47th president. Chants of U-S-A could be heard in the overspill hall. Trump began to join in the clapping for himself. He hasn't quite got the hang of this.\n\nThe gloves came off as he started his inaugural address. You couldn't escape the threat in his voice. Donald is still a man who feels that Donald has been wronged. All he had was a narrative of betrayal. He laid into Biden for the decline of America. But he was on hand to bring about the golden age of America. This was the moment the US had been awaiting for nearly 250 years. So modest.\n\nHe too believed God had spared him to save America. Everything was going to change. There would be a national emergency on the southern border. Immigrants watch out. There would also be tariffs, though he wasn't sure how they would work. And bring on the climate change deniers. Drill, baby, drill. He couldn't make the connection to the disasters in North Carolina and LA.\n\nTry to look on him as the messiah. A peacemaker. A unifier. The best. The very bestest best. The Gulf of Mexico would be renamed the Gulf of America. The Panama canal would be seized. Mars, here we come. By now, most of the audience were bouncing up and down in their chairs.\n\n\"The impossible is what we do best,\" he ended. \"We're going to win like never before.\" There was a minute's unscheduled pause before Carrie Underwood sang America the Beautiful. It turned out it had been impossible to tee up the music on the laptop. Making America great again."

      "text": "The baby boomers still want to make America great again\n\nTrump may not have carried all before him, but in times of fear and inequality, his ideas still resonate - and not just in the US\n\nP lacards adorned with the slogans \"America First\" and \"Make America Great Again\" are destined for landfill now that the trap door of American politics has opened under Donald Trump's feet. Some will put them aside for a possible return of \"the Donald\" in 2024 - should he avoid scrutiny over allegedly fraudulent tax returns , and should the Republican party back him again. Otherwise, millions of dollars of election paraphernalia are destined for the bin.\n\nYet a widespread belief that a change of guard at the White House means the yearning behind the slogans will disappear is naive. Every developed country has its version of America First, not least the UK. After all, what is Brexit if not a demand to put Britain first?\n\nFor the past 10 years Angela Merkel has put Germany first, refusing to distribute the huge gains made in export orders from exchanging the Deutschmark for the cheaper euro. The same goes for the Netherlands, Austria and the other rich nations of northern Europe that have hung on to their euro gains while attaching so many bailout strings to those southern countries that lost out - Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal - that some still, even now, refuse to take all the funds.\n\nThe west's rich nations are told almost daily that collaboration will help them achieve a broad set of goals - ones that will increase the wellbeing of their populations. The International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, supposedly among the most influential of international bodies, say it in all their reports these days. They also argue that tackling rising inequality and agreeing climate emergency goals will build a bridge to a more sustainable economy, for rich and poor alike.\n\nThey may sing with one voice, but on these issues they are ignored by the politicians they seek to win over.\n\nA new book, The Upswing , by self-styled \"changemaker\" Shaylyn Romney Garrett and Robert Putnam, the political scientist who has advised the last three US presidents and the last three British prime ministers, claims to have found the reason for this lack of civility and co-operation. They have tracked the usage of the words \"we\" and \"I\" in American books over the past 100 years to reveal a growing emphasis on self and self-help.\n\nThe growing use of \"I\" since the 1970s does not, say Garrett and Puttnam, have much to do with economics. They believe it can be blamed on a dearth of leadership.\n\nOnce, there were enthusiastic leaders keen to improve the lot of all peoples - before the second world war (Roosevelt) and in the 1950s and 1960s (Martin Luther King). But such politicians are absent now. The tipping point occurred in the late 1960s, a good decade and a half before inequality began to increase, according to Puttnam.\n\nIf rising inequality were the only economic development that sows discontent and destroys cohesive communities, this might hold water. But it isn't. Rising prices and increasing automation have a huge impact on ordinary families, making them panic about their ability to better themselves.\n\nThe authors could also look closer at demographic trends and the growing numbers of baby boomers entering the workforce from the late 1960s. Boomers have, with few exceptions, obsessed about homeownership and building a financial wall around themselves and their families. They tend to vote for social democratic parties in the good times and switch to fiscally conservative parties when anxious about the future. The same applies in the UK.\n\nToday, real estate is the world's most important asset. It accounts for 60% of the world's $500 trillion of assets, beating stocks and shares and government bonds into the proverbial cocked hat.\n\nLast week the Bank of England injected another £150bn into the economy as a boost during the second Covid-19 lockdown. What this money will mostly do is protect London's financial system. And when 90% of high street bank lending is on residential mortgages, what is the financial system? It's a gamble on real estate.\n\nAn ageing middle class which has seen blue-collar workers lose their employment protections and suffer 20 years of wage freezes doesn't want to go the same way. What better protection than property?\n\nSo while many voters in key marginal seats found they couldn't stomach four more years of Trump, it appears they voted Republican on every other ballot, from their local legislature to the representatives they send to Congress.\n\nFight China, fight Mexico and fight Europe. America First, they say, whoever is president.\n\nThis is the archive of The Observer up until 21/04/2025. The Observer is now owned and operated by Tortoise Media."

      "text": "Inside the Maga mind: Trump's most dedicated fans explain their fervor\n\nFrom camaraderie to a shared political vision, these campaign rally regulars explain why they're all-in for Trump\n\nThey are the Maga masses - ordinary people for whom Donald Trump represents hope, not fear, and whose lives have been changed by the Trump era.\n\nSome drive thousands of miles, seeing parts of the US they might never otherwise see, to attend the former US president's campaign rallies, often camping outside for days to ensure they get a front-row seat. The rallies provide music, politics and a sense of belonging unlike anything else that society offers them.\n\nOthers sell \"Make America great again\" merchandise. An entire cottage industry has grown up around quirky, witty or insulting bobbleheads, hats, mugs, T-shirts and other paraphernalia. Within hours of Trump surviving an attempted assassination at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, the indelible image of him standing defiant, face bloodied and fist raised, was available on T-shirts.\n\nFor these fans, Trump transcends politics: they are in love with his brand of television-induced celebrity, charismatic leadership and willingness to take on perceived elites. That Trump could survive a shooting now elevates him to a near divine status - a figure of destiny to whom their devotion is complete.\n\nHe resents the same things they do. He is their hammer.\n\nHere are six of them in their own words. These interviews contain unfounded claims about voter fraud, the 6 January 2021 insurrection, immigration and the criminal cases against Trump.\n\nAntwon Williams, 42 , owns mobile phone repair shops and lives in Columbia, South Carolina. His father is a bishop and school principal. A van he bought three years ago to sell merchandise at Trump rallies has now clocked 260,000 miles.\n\nWhat people have to understand is that Blacks are raised to learn about survival. We don't know much about politics and that's why I was so late to this game. I didn't know anything about politics until [Barack] Obama. Obama gave us a reason to get out and care with the whole change message - it was beautiful. Until I found out what he stood for - and that's a whole 'nother story.\n\nI was selling merch for the Obama campaign for a long time. Then I was doing Hillary merch but Hillary - I don't know, for whatever reason - got hurt and stopped campaigning for a while so I ended up working Trump forever. My first Trump rally was back in 2015. I remember him saying at the end of his speech, to my Black community, \"What do you have to lose? Give me a chance.\" And dude, here I am. Yes, sir. I gave him a chance, man.\n\nOver the years, God has blessed us . The good thing is we get to employ about 10 people and we all go around the country and it's beautiful, man. You're not making millions but, hell, you're making a living. The first piece of merch I sold was a Maga hat for $25. Now they are $30 each. The Maga hat will never be outsold.\n\nEverything comes from my brain; I make T-shirts on the fly now. What's going to always be up next is when the Democratic side run their mouth and start calling us names and trying to bully us. They called us \"ultra Maga\" so we made the Ultra Maga thing and it became a symbol. Then they wanted to call us deplorables and then guess what? Proud deplorables was born.\n\nThe more they talk, the more we're going to keep creating things, so we love it. I mean, hell, they went in and gave him a mugshot and now it's a symbol of America. It's a symbol of the Black community. [He points to a T-shirt with Trump's mugshot.] \"Never surrender.\" He's definitely wanted - only for president.'\n\nIn the beginning it was purely business, but now it's fully fledged. This is what I believe in and stand for . I think he gives a damn. He simply cares. Everyone wants to make him out to be a racist but man, the biggest thing I ask people is: show me one racist thing he's done to us Blacks besides help us.\n\nI know that sounds very ignorant, but at the same time the guy helps us in every way he can, man. I mean, he brought jobs back to the Black community. Growing up, all my family was landscapers and painters and stuff like that. The Mexicans came in and took all the jobs away. The Black community couldn't understand and see where he was helping us, but by removing just the illegals away it gave us an even playing field and that's how he was able to get this economy back booming.\n\nI've met President Trump twice now. He's freaking amazing and that's why it's so crazy for me to ever find out that he's this \"racist\" guy that everyone wants to make him out. He put his hand out to shake my hand immediately. He told me thank you for what I do. It made chills run through me. It made me feel like he cares. It was important to me. It's beautiful. He's beautiful.\n\nA lot of politicians - 99% of the politicians - are going to blow smoke up your ass and lie to you to tell you whatever they want to tell you but this guy, he's going to tell it exactly where it is. That's why I call him the Blackest president we ever had.\n\nI am seeing more Black people attend the rallies. Especially with them bullying him through the streets these days with giving him all these fake charges. Trump gets to see how Black men live out here and now, right before every American eye, where they used to say that Black people are crying wolf, now they get to see exactly how the justice system does us as Blacks. They're bullying him literally right before everyone's eyes and it's not fair.\n\nThat's why I call him the Blackest president ever alive.\n\nI go through racism every day, but where people misunderstand it is the racism that I go through is not from Blacks getting mad at me because I'm out here doing this; it's from whites. They are always looking at me saying, \"Black lives matter,\" and I'm like, yes, my Black life matters but that doesn't mean that I have to stand behind the things that they stand behind.\n\nThey call me Uncle Tom, sellout, the whole nine, but I'm used to it, I'm used to the language, I'm used to the rhetoric. One thing it's not going to do is turn me away from what I believe in at this point. It's that simple.\n\nThe 2020 election was stolen. I travelled this country day in, day out, rally to rally. I saw the tens of thousands of people in every county, and he would do two counties over and still 20 and 30,000 people would show up. I saw the numbers and there's no way you going to tell me that loss. I saw it with my own eyes, so therefore we didn't lose anything. It was taken away from us. It was stolen. The White House was definitely stolen .\n\nMy prediction is that we're going to have a landslide victory in November. They're going to try and make a move but what I say to that is: just try it, buddy. Trump tried to warn us the first time but now the world is watching, so yeah, let 'em just try it.\n\nI'm into politics now. It's not something I can turn a blind eye to. To watch the way he sacrificed everything just for us, the American people - people hate when I say this - it's kind of like the way Jesus sacrificed everything for us, his children, as well. He's literally sacrificing everything for us as American people.\n\nSharon Anderson, 68, is retired from jobs in schools and law enforcement and lives in Etowah, Tennessee. She owns the Awesome Ass Acres farm and has five mules and a donkey. She has attended 53 Trump campaign rallies and is one of the \"front row Joes\".\n\nI don't want to sound corny but the night Donald Trump came down the escalator, it was almost a surreal feeling that came over me. My husband, Larry, was there watching it on TV and said, \"Donald Trump's running for president?\" I said, \"You know what, he's my president, that's my president.\" I've never swayed, I've never wavered, not a breath, not a hair.\n\nLarry and I have been married 40 years. I've been divorced twice. If he wasn't a Trump supporter, number three would have been through the process now.\n\nMy first Trump rally was in North Carolina - it was 2015 or 16. It was kind of low-key. He didn't have a lot of security with him. The crowd was real big. It was inside a coliseum and it was packed.\n\nI always get to the rallies several days in advance. I have something called a cot tent. It's as wide as a camping tent, folds up about the size of a cart, but the tent is actually attached to the cot and you're enclosed in there. I've got a little Trailblazer, a little SUV, I don't even know what year model. It's just big enough that if I sleep catty-corner I can sleep in the back if I don't have my cot tent with me.\n\nUsually a person's first question is of hygiene: where do you take your showers? Various ones of us have memberships at Planet Fitness and so you can find a Planet Fitness in every town just about. We'll go there and take showers. Usually, if I get there five days ahead of time, I'm there three days at least by myself and I'll stay on my phone, I'll read a book, I'll take a nap, I'll just hang out.\n\nOn March 2, 2020, right before Covid hit, I went to a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina. I had gone and stayed five days before the rally. I slept on the sidewalk for five days. The night of the rally, I was right in the front of the rail, Lara and Eric Trump came out and spoke and when [Eric] finished he said, \"My dad'll be out here in about 45 minutes.\"\n\nBut he said, \"We're going to do something tonight that we've only done once before since my dad's been in office,\" and he said the Secret Service hates it - he said: \"We're going to recognise somebody in the audience.\" I thought, Oh great, who's that going to be? He looked at his hand and he said, where's Jenny Anderson? My name's not Jenny. I looked around, I thought, What Anderson's here? I don't know.\n\nThen he said, \"Wait a minute, I've got the name wrong. Where's Sharon Anderson?\" He had me come up on stage and speak to 20,000 people. That was the last rally before the Covid shutdown. That particular video actually went viral. It was a special rally for me.\n\nA Trump rally is almost like a reunion. You're in a crowd that varies from thousands to - well, the number in Wildwood, New Jersey, was listed as 107,000. You're at a gathering of people that's like-minded. They're all there because they're looking to make this country great again. They are sick of the current situation. They are sick of their budget not covering groceries every week, not covering their medical supplies, their prescriptions.\n\n[Trump's] unusual. He's a wonderful public speaker and I love him as a comedian too, because he's very funny. I got to meet him two years ago. He is extremely personable. Even as a billionaire, I feel like I could invite him to my little meagre existence here in east Tennessee and I wouldn't be nervous about it.\n\nTrump won the election in 2020. No one will ever convince me otherwise. I'm not a scholar. I'm not a political analyst. I'm not an attorney. I'm not anywhere even close to an expert. But when at three o'clock everybody goes to bed, you're winning by landslide, and then it takes a week - first time in history - for the votes to be counted, something's not right. Trump won the 2020 election.\n\nAs for the Trump criminal trial and his conviction in New York, are we surprised? Was I wishing for a different outcome? Yes. Did I pray for a different outcome? Absolutely. But I'm not surprised because the district attorney was compromised. The jury from demographics alone was compromised and the judge was compromised. The entire case is built on false accusations and legal actions that had holes in them.\n\nThe January 6 prosecutions is one of the biggest travesties in this country's history. If there's somebody that was guilty of violence and destruction, that's one thing, but there are people being held in warlike conditions.\n\nI can't say that I wouldn't have walked in [to the US Capitol building]. Now, would I have gone in with violence and destruction on my mind? No, absolutely not, because I wasn't there for that. But if people had opened doors - there's videos of officials opening doors and having people come in - had I been there at the moment, I probably would have walked in and I'm a 68-year-old grandma. I could be in prison right now. Who knows, the FBI may come tomorrow.\n\nTrump gives me and millions of others hope and encouragement for the future of our country. I'm 68 years old and, if nature takes its course, I hope to have some future left. But my future is not as long as my grandchildren's future. We've got to have hope. We have to have something to look forward to and Donald Trump gives that.\n\nMike Boatman, 56, is an independent contractor living in Evansville, Indiana. This year he won election as a delegate and precinct committeeman for the state Republican convention .\n\nI voted Republican ever since I was 18. I never went to any kind of rally, any kind of political meeting or event, until Donald Trump.\n\nMy first Trump rally was in Evansville in April 2016. I was a supporter of Trump before then because of his policies and everything he was saying he would do if he became president. Everything he was saying was what I was for. I voted Republican my whole life but the candidates wasn't 100% what I believed in.\n\nI have been to 90 rallies and 15 other events that Trump spoke at. I'm part of the group of \"front row Joes\". I've been to a couple of rallies six days early but now I'm more like I get there 24 hours early. I don't have to be the first one in line because I know if I get there a day early I'll still get a good seat and possibly the front row.\n\nA Trump rally is fun. There's no violence. You're there with like-minded people. It's hard to explain unless you've been to one.\n\nI enjoy his speeches. A lot of things he'll repeat because he's given the same speech to different people in different states and towns. When he goes to a new city there's a lot a first-timers - people who have never been to a rally. So he does give the same speech a lot, but he changes it up depending on what's in the news cycle.\n\nI believe in Donald Trump's policies and I believe that he is sincere and wants to help this country as much as he can. He's proven himself when he was president for four years. Everything that he said he was going to do he did - or he tried to do. Some of it he got backlash [for] and some of it the Congress held him up from getting things done, especially the [border] wall.\n\nHe almost had it completed and I believe when he gets back in he'll finish the wall and we'll get that border fixed. Are we going to fix it where not one person will illegally cross over? No, we're still going to have illegals make it over. But it's the amount of people. Right now so many people are crossing over we don't know who's crossing over. I have nothing against legal immigration but our country can't sustain everybody that wants to come over.\n\nIn my opinion, it's the media and the liberal Democrats that were saying Republicans are not for Black people or poor people. Saying Donald Trump was a racist when he came down that escalator in 2015 was the biggest lie that was ever told.\n\nI knew who Donald Trump was back in the 80s. I knew he was this big real estate guy and I knew he owned casinos back then and owned the New Jersey Generals and he got Herschel Walker to play for him. But I never knew him being a racist.\n\nHe didn't have to run for president. Everything he's gone through in eight years, I don't see how he does it. They're coming after him left and right because they didn't want him. They didn't want him in 2016. I don't know why.\n\nI sat there and watched the whole 2020 election. I didn't go to sleep for 48 hours. Trump was winning so big and then it seemed like around 11 o'clock my time, central time, everybody shut down. I've never seen that before. Every presidential election I've watched, whether it was Obama, Bill Clinton or George Bush, I've never seen this. You knew who won that night.\n\nEventually it'll come out. Everything eventually comes out, just like when they accused Donald Trump of colluding with Russia. Adam Schiff said he'll present all this evidence and we found out it was a big old lie.\n\nWith the New York convictions, I'm still trying to figure out what Trump did wrong. Where's the crime? You could tell the judge was biased. I believe most people can see what's going on. It's political persecution. If people believed that Donald Trump commits all these crimes at this time, he would resign because his poll numbers would drop.\n\nEvery time they indicted him, he had more support. After 34 convictions he's raised so much money . Most people see that it's a witch-hunt, that they're just trying to stop him any way they can from going back to the White House. It's going to fail. Trump's going to win in November.\n\nDonna Fitzsimons, 64, lives in Gladwin, Michigan. She spent years at home caring for her mother in her final years. She has since travelled the country with her sister Lori Levi selling Maga merchandise.\n\nIn 2020, when they cancelled the rallies, my sister called me and said, \"If I buy a trailer, will you go on the road with me?\" I had nothing holding me and I said yeah. We jumped in that trailer in May 2020 and we've been on the road pretty much ever since.\n\nWe have gone everywhere. Two women in a trailer - they called us \"the Trump girls\". We're the Trump girls of Michigan. They call for \"the trailer with the Trump girls\". It's kind of funny: up in [Michigan's Upper Peninsula], there was a bar and you walk in and they applaud you just for being out there spreading the word of Trump .\n\nAll I have to do is grab my suitcase because I packed everything in it that I need. Oh my God, America is just so beautiful. It's jaw-dropping. The best place was Alaska. I found out what the word \"majesty\" meant. That's exactly how I felt.\n\nWe carry American-made things. I'm not sure if anybody else does. I know we were the first to carry American-made hats because those are hard to get. We do American-made shirts. We do have to go to vendors just to compete because that's the way the world is made up. You have to compete. We do USA shirts and things like that. We try to pull as much USA things as we possibly can, or homemade things. We try to use smaller printing shops to help - something to just get them on their way and help them on their feet.\n\nWe never changed our prices because we know it's hard for everybody out there. I know it hits us too but we still have to be fair with the people. We have a couple of items like \"F*** Biden\" but we keep that on the back shelf. That has to be personally asked for. We don't think it's something that should be down where the children will see.\n\nFinding the right area to put our trailer can sometimes be a little bit exhausting and getting permission from people can sometimes be tiring. You have to understand business people: there are some that don't care and they'll say, \"Yes, set up,\" because we're Trump [supporters], and then there's others. We find that auto part stores, muffler shops, are usually good about letting us set up. But then you go to the mom and pop stores and they're like, \"No, I don't think so.\"\n\nOne time we were at a store way out by the water and a guy said, \"You guys have to go! You have to go! Somebody said they are going to come by and shoot at you.\" We're not afraid. Everywhere we go, we take that chance. When the campaign takes over they use any trailer as first line of sight, so we're always taking that chance. People don't realise just being a vendor out there how dangerous that is just for us to be there and promote.\n\nIf you look at pictures or speeches where he's got people behind him that aren't wearing any of his hats or anything that says \"Trump\", it just doesn't look right - it looks more like Biden. Biden's never has anything. You look over where Trump's got everybody with hats and shirts, it looks totally different. It brings up a whole different feeling in you when you take a look at the two side by side.\n\nA Trump rally is always exciting. When you get a group of like-minded people together you can feel it in the air, the energy that he's bringing. People are happy. I've seen people stand in the rain all day long. I've seen them stand in snow and cold all day long just to see him. Cold that I couldn't even stand in - I had to get in the car, I was freezing to death.\n\nThey don't care. They just have faith in him. They want to see him. He speaks clearly, he speaks firmly and he gives a sense of safety, like leadership, like everything's going to be OK. Everybody's just looking to hear that voice to calm that inner self, like everything's OK. They get that when he speaks.\n\nI have never seen anybody have any problem. The only time they've ever stopped is when a Democrat slipped through. That's when you get the anger and hatred: they start going crazy.\n\nBlake Marnell, 59, known as \"Brick Suit\", lives in San Diego, California, and has attended many Trump campaign events, including the rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on 13 July where the former president narrowly survived an assassination attempt.\n\nIt did not start with Donald Trump. I voted for Ronald Reagan for president in 1984 and then I never participated in any election at the state, local or federal level until 2020. Even when Donald Trump was running initially in 2016, I didn't know he was going to be as effective as he turned out to be so I was not initially a supporter. I did not vote for him in 2016.\n\nThen when he got into office and one of the very first things he did was get the United States out of the Paris climate accord and cancel the Trans-Pacific partnership - two things that I thought would never happen - I started paying attention and so then I was following him.\n\nThe first rally I went to was in 2018 in Las Vegas. I got there four hours before it was scheduled to start and ended up being very far back from the front row. It was a great time and I enjoyed talking with people in line. At the time it was kind of dicey to express support for conservatives - we were taking a bit of flak in the real world.\n\nThey had already started taking people off the internet like Alex Jones and a lot of big profile accounts were being taken off of Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. My reaction was, OK, if we can't have first amendment rights online, because those are all private companies who had their own policies, my feeling was at least I can have it in real life.\n\nI started wearing a \"Make America great again\" hat in public and got many more positive reactions than negative ones. That emboldened me: there are a lot of people out there who support President Trump but for some reason are unwilling to generally acknowledge it in public in the way that I can by wearing a hat.\n\nKnowing that I was going to Washington DC, I was picking out a suit and thinking about which topic. You can't wear something that's like a tax cut - no one's going to get it. So I latched on to my next favourite thing about President Trump's policies at the time, which was border security. I said, what about a wall suit?\n\nI found the suit online. It is called a stag suit: essentially it is a costume suit for gentleman in England to buy so they can get into the good clubs and have a dress code for a suit while at the same time being able to enjoy the night in any way. If they actually destroy the suit in the process or rip the fabric, they don't have to worry about it too much because it's just a costume.\n\nI never thought the border issue would become as powerful as it is now. It shouldn't have been. The border issue was taken care of as far as I thought. It was put to bed. Illegal immigration was under control. Unfortunately under Biden, who I think vindictively and spitefully has disabled all of President Trump's beneficial border policies, it has become such a huge issue.\n\nPresident Trump announced a rally in Montoursville, Pennsylvania, in May 2019. I had the whole suit and knew what time to get there to be in the front and, sure enough, I was third in line and got a seat right in the front. Then he ended up calling me up on stage at the rally.\n\nAt that time I didn't have any conventional social media. I had a conundrum: do I just put the suit back in the closet and never wear it again? I decided to basically become a meme for the campaign in real life. What am I going call myself - Wall Man? Well, that's not what I want to be. Why not just Brick Suit? Simple.\n\nThe reason I picked that is it helps people remember that moment when the president of the United States picked someone at random out of the crowd at a rally and brought them up on stage, and that is not something that you would see typically in any other western democracy. You're not going to see Macron do that. You're not going to see anybody in England do that. It's not going to happen in Germany. It's not going to happen in Italy. It speaks immensely to President Trump and the connection he has with his supporters, that he has that level of trust in them, that he would do something like that.\n\nYou're with a group of people that you know share similar politics to you and, for many people, it's one of the few spaces that they can actually discuss their politics without fear of censure.\n\nI look at it as being a uniquely American crowd: the people who are there support the idea of America. The phrase \"America first\" is often used. Especially lately, there's been a lot of coverage about President Trump's increasing polling support in the Hispanic and Black community. I look at those and I toss those labels out the window and I say, for myself, that translates as President Trump's increasing support among American voters because that's all they are. I'm not looking at it in terms of demographics.\n\nI find him to be charismatic speaker. In contrast to other politicians, he is willing to call a spade a spade, to say it like it is and to not be afraid.\n\nLet's face it: he's funny. He has a sense of humour. He knows how to employ it. He can employ it surgically or broadly or in many different ways but there's no denying that he has a sense of humour that Americans relate to.\n\nI have worn the brick suit in San Diego and I intend to wear it again. San Diego is not quite as liberal as some other California cities. But I can tell you this, as someone who's been wearing a brick suit and a simple Trump hat since 2018, my perception is the level of animosity towards overt expression of support for President Trump is significantly lower now in 2024 than it was in the 2020 election.\n\nRonald Solomon, 65, an investment banker, was born in New Rochelle, New York, and is now based in Palm Beach, Florida. In 2016 he founded the Maga Mall , \"your one-stop shopping experience for Maga and patriotic products\".\n\nI'm an active Republican. Back in 2016 I was actually backing Ted Cruz, and when Trump won the Indiana primary the writing was on the wall. When I went from one campaign to the other, the first thing I did was order hats for my volunteers. It was a given in my mind .\n\nI had a whole crew of people who were knocking on doors. I needed 50 \"Make America great again\" hats for them. The hats out there were either very expensive or total crap - most hats are made out of acrylic and polyester.\n\nI had 144 hats made. The finest quality at that time that was ever made. It was made of premium cotton twill like all my hats are on the website; I don't make acrylic or polyester hats. The hats back then had little letters; my letters were big in times roman with the finest embroidery and thread there was.\n\nA couple of months after making those hats, I gave 50 away and then I had them left and started selling them. Then before you know it people wanted white ones and blue ones and black ones and I started tons of those and then doing shirts and all this stuff. It just took off.\n\nI realised early on when he won that election the hat was a symbol that there were other people that thought like they did. I'm sure a lot of those people were apathetic. At the time I lived in Nevada and I was a precinct captain and I was at the caucuses. I would say about 30% to 40% of the Trump voters were either crossovers from Democrats and independents or had never voted in their lives.\n\nThink about that. If everyone's wearing the hats and people see \"they think like me\", in close races like in Michigan and in Pennsylvania in Wisconsin, those hats made a difference. If it was not for the hats, he maybe even wouldn't have become president.\n\nThe Maga Mall is a very successful business and I don't even count the money. My main objective in this company is to make sure I have the products; when a person calls and places the order they get it. That's a whole world in itself. And going around the country and showing the product line.\n\nOur hats are unbelievable. We destroy the competition. There's no comparison. I'm on the cutting edge. I'm always making new designs and then one, two, three, four months down the road you see they're knocked off.\n\nNinety-nine per cent of the stuff I sell is mostly positive while if you look at the left they're walking down these marches with the most hideous signs and the most hideous outfits, doing things like throwing blood on effigies. The left is much more negative at marches while I would say at the Trump rally everyone will be positive .\n\nIt's a lot of camaraderie and diversity of people from all walks of life. It's also family-oriented. You don't see that on the left. A lot of it is very spiritual, religious and patriotic as far as the flag is concerned, \"God bless America\". As a matter of fact, I had a whole line of patriotic hats: \"God bless America\", \"In God we trust\", \"We the people 1776\", \"America First\" - and people love that. Those are big sellers.\n\nTrump has got charisma. He's got guts. He says what he's gonna do and he delivers. This guy, I've never seen anything like it. This sitting in courtrooms with these kangaroo courts and facing jail terms and I see him personally - I go to Mar-a-Lago - and you see the guy and you'd think he doesn't have a care in the world.\n\nEven in the dark days after January 6 - that nonsense trying to make it look like it was some massive planned insurrection, a bunch of crap - I knew this guy would never stop. Two days after that whole action I put in an order to make 50,000 2024 hats and related hats, right then and there. People thought I was nuts.\n\nI know this man: he is never stopping and I believe, like he believes, that election was stolen. You see these people with these mail-out ballots, who knows who got them? Anybody who truly believes there wasn't massive fraud there, it's nuts, and these voting machines, it's crazy.\n\nLet's cut to the chase. [Trump's enemies] are trying to do everything and anything - they use taxpayers' money to do it; I believe these people are totally corrupt.\n\nThis group of people, whoever they are, ensured this man will become the next president of the United States. If they think they're going to put him in a prison, well, they'll create a Nelson Mandela.\n\nTrump knows who I am. I know who he is. Have we ever had a palsy-walsy get-together? Not really, but it's pretty cool. Actually the last time I had lunch with him was like - my goodness gracious - 30 years ago. It was at Mar-A-Lago on the terrace; there was like 10 people at the table and he was a great guy, a regular guy. We had a good time.\n\nEditorial note: the Guardian does not endorse the views expressed in this article. The false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen due to widespread voter fraud was rejected in more than 60 lawsuits and by Trump's own attorney general. More than 1,230 people have been charged with federal crimes in the January 6 US Capitol riot, ranging from misdemeanor offences such as trespassing to felonies such as assaulting police officers and seditious conspiracy . There is no evidence that the criminal prosecution of Trump in New York was politically motivated.\n\nThis is the archive of The Observer up until 21/04/2025.

      "text": "RFK Jr sought 'Make America Healthy Again' trademark for vaccine marketing\n\nTrump's health secretary pick transferred ownership of Maha slogan application to anti-vaccine ally Del Bigtree\n\nRobert F Kennedy Jr , the anti-vaccine activist and conspiracy theorist nominated for US health secretary by Donald Trump , recently applied to trademark his own \"Make America Healthy Again\" slogan for use in marketing potential products including food supplements, vitamins, essential oils - and vaccines.\n\nDocumentation filed with the Office of Government Ethics lists $100,000 earned from a \"licensing agreement to use Maha brand marks\".\n\nAs reported by the Washington Post , on 10 December Kennedy transferred ownership of the trademark application to a company managed by Del Bigtree.\n\nBigtree is a TV and film producer who was the communications director for Kennedy's 2024 presidential campaign. He is also the founder of Informed Consent Action Network, an anti-vaccine group which trumpets him as \"one of the preeminent voices of the vaccine risk awareness movement around the world\".\n\nAccording to the trademark application reported by the Post, dated 16 December, Bigtree's new company is called Maha Worldwide and has a mailing address in Sheridan, Wyoming.\n\n\"Maha\" is a play on \"Maga\", the acronym for Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" slogan which has become a descriptor for the president's worldview.\n\nEarlier this month, as Trump celebrated his return to power, Bigtree hosted a \"Maha Inaugural Ball\", \"a celebration of health, unity, and the movement led by Robert F Kennedy Jr\", held at the DC Waldorf Astoria.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2023, Kennedy led Children's Health Defense, a non-profit which campaigned against public health programs including vaccination provision. He was nominated for health secretary in mid-November and is now in the midst of a highly contentious confirmation process ; on Wednesday, that process produced the spectacle of the widely known anti-vaccine campaigner and conspiracy theorist insisting to senators he was not opposed to vaccines.\n\nDenying accusations of spreading anti-vaccine misinformation in Samoa, which he visited in 2019, shortly before 83 people - mostly children - died there of measles, Kennedy said: \"You cannot find a single Samoan who will say, 'I didn't get a vaccine because of Bobby Kennedy.'\"\n\nKennedy also told senators he was not a conspiracy theorist, saying: \"That is a pejorative ... that's applied to me mainly to keep me from asking difficult questions of powerful interests.\"\n\nAttending the hearing, Bigtree told the Post he did not know what he was going to use the Maha trademark for, but said: \"I have no intention to ever make a vaccine. That's not something I'm inspired to do.\"\n\nSign up to This Week in Trumpland\n\nA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nBigtree also said he was looking at a possible venture in cryptocurrency - another possible product listed on the trademark application - but said he would \"not be out to sort of make a buck or somehow use people in any way\".\n\nKennedy and his representatives did not comment about his trademark application and its transferral to Bigtree.\n\nPublic health experts expressed alarm.\n\nPeter Lurie of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a former US Food and Drug Administration official, told the Post it was \"jarring\" that \"on the one hand, questions are raised about the safety of vaccines, and on the other you turn around and monetize it\"."

      "text": "What Does Trump Mean By 'Make America Great Again'?\n\nConsumer advocate, lawyer and author\n\nDonald Trump 's now ubiquitous slogan, \"Make America Great Again!\", is often chanted at rallies, but rarely scrutinized in public discourse. What era in America's past is Mr. Trump referring to when he says \"Again\"?\n\nWould Mr. Trump prefer America return to the days of slavery, Jim Crow and labor exploitation in unsafe factories, mines, foundries and plantations? How about the late 19th century when \"Robber Barons\" monopolized one industry after another? Is he longing for the days when women were second-class citizens and couldn't vote, until securing this right less than 100 years ago, only to still be paid lower wages than their male colleagues for performing the same jobs and faced with consumer and educational discrimination?\n\nOr is Trump referring to a time when the US was less of a giant empire than it is today?\n\nOr, more optimistically, in the nineteen sixties and early seventies when America had its highest real wages and a large trade surplus? Has anyone heard him say he wanted to return America to that prominence that peaked in the nineteen sixties?\n\nHe surely doesn't want to raise wages for workers. On the campaign trail last year he said wages were too high and has not championed raising the frozen federal minimum wage (at $7.25 an hour) since.\n\nHe has spoken often about revising trade agreements to reduce our trade deficit, but he's not going to take on the opposition of the emigrating giant global corporations to reduce our trade deficit.\n\nMaybe he wants to go back to the America before there was Medicare and Medicaid, before dangerous cars had to be recalled, before food had to be labelled, before unions existed to collectively bargain with large companies in the auto, steel and oil industries?\n\nDoes he miss the days when there were segregated restaurants, hotels, trains and buses? What about when people could smoke in your space on airplanes, in college lecture halls, hospital waiting rooms, cafes, offices and just about all public spaces, no matter the presence of children and asthmatics? Or when people with disabilities faced physical exclusion and career discrimination?\n\nMore benignly, perhaps Mr. Trump is longing for the days when there was less soil erosion, fewer toxic chemicals in the environment and more family farms. Or when there was far less obesity and diabetes and less aggressive marketing to children of fast food full of fat, sugar and salt. If so, he sure is not going to Make America Great with the corporatists he's appointed to run the Food and Drug Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency or the Department of Agriculture.\n\nDoes he want to Make America Great Again by returning to the days when there were fewer people in prisons per capita, fewer non-violent drug offenders serving long sentences, including juveniles, fewer if any private corporate prisons? If so, he is going to have problems with his Attorney General, Jeff Sessions. What about when casino gambling was highly restricted and only legal in Nevada? It's unlikely Mr. Trump would have wanted to prohibit gambling in his Atlantic City Casinos before they failed or went bankrupt. With his flurry of statements and Tweets endorsing sexual harasser and accused pedophile, defeated Senate candidate Roy Moore, Trump, given his boastful aggression toward women, certainly does not want to return to an America when such widely publicized misbehavior would have kept men from even running for office.\n\nMaybe, Mr. Trump has a limited meaning to \"Again.\" Maybe he means going back to a time when America was respected and feared in the world. Going back to the days when a smaller Japan and Germany made war on the US or when Britain played Woodrow Wilson and the US for suckers and got us into World War I, which led to World War II. Oh, such glorious nostalgia for Donald J. Trump.\n\nWhat a speech Trump could give were he to explain what Making America Great Again means to him. He could explain his desire to go back to the prosperous Sixties when big corporations and the rich paid much higher taxes, didn't dare pay their CEOs more than 30 times the average wage in their companies and had to comply with a higher real minimum wage. He could wax nostalgic over the larger relative infrastructure budgets of the federal government, or the days when student debt was small or non-existent compared to the huge student debt load now imposed on this younger generation of Americans.\n\nIf all this sounds a little confusing, it is. Voters should have rejected such an unrebutted slogan repeated to applauding crowds again and again by Donald Trump in his get-away-with-anything presidential campaign of 2016.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "RFK Jr. Tries To Redefine The Meaning Of MAGA After Endorsing Trump\n\nSenior Reporter\n\nNow that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is backing Donald Trump , he wants people to rethink the Republican's \"Make America Great Again\" slogan.\n\nThe long-shot presidential candidate turned to X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, on Sunday morning to share a lengthy reinterpretation of the right-wing's motto , which has long been read as Trump's shorthand to turn back the clock on rights to reproductive freedom, the social welfare system, immigration access, and more.\n\nIn a post that proclaimed to detail \"what 'MAGA' really means,\" RFK wrote, \"The phrase has troubled liberals who think it is a call for a return to an America before civil rights, gay rights, and women's rights,\" before offering a \"more generous interpretation\" of the phrase.\n\nClaiming his definition of MAGA was \"one that is truer to my experience of Donald Trump as he is today,\" the Kennedy family scion said. \"'Make America Great Again' recalls a nation brimming with vitality, with a can-do spirit, with hope and a belief in itself.\"\n\n\"It was an America that was beginning to confront its darker shadows, could acknowledge the injustice in its past and present, yet at the same time could celebrate its successes,\" he went on.\n\n\"It was a nation of broad prosperity, the world's most vibrant middle class, and a idealistic belief (though not consistently applied) in freedom, justice, and democracy,\" Kennedy continued. \"It was a nation that led the world in innovation, productivity, and technology. And it was the healthiest country in the world.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Trump's 'Make America Great Again' Myth Reaches Its Catastrophic Conclusion\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nA deranged mob of Americans, fueled by lies about election fraud peddled by the president of the United States along with multiple senators and House members, sacked the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday as part of an insurrection encouraged by Donald Trump to stop the constitutional process allowing for the peaceful transfer of power taking place within the building.\n\n\"[Y]ou'll never take back your country with weakness,\" Trump told the rioters immediately before they marched on the Capitol. \"You have to show strength and be strong.\"\n\n\"We're going to try to give our Republicans - the weak ones, because the strong ones don't need any of our help - we're going to try and give them [the] kind of pride and boldness they need to take back our country,\" he said to the crowd on the National Mall.\n\nThe ensuing riot led members of Congress to flee in gas masks after police deployed tear gas as an armed standoff took place between U.S. Capitol Police and rioters at the doors of the House Chamber. Confederate flags were paraded through the halls of Congress as rioters donned in tactical military gear and carrying zip-tie handcuffs , likely intended to be used to kidnap lawmakers, entered the Senate chamber. They screamed for Mike Pence's head after Trump denounced his own vice president in an audio message. Some wore sweatshirts bearing the message : \"MAGA Civil War\" and the date, \"1.6.21.\"\n\nOn the grounds outside, rioters erected a giant wooden cross and a gallows with a noose. Reporters were beaten and threatened with death . Their cameras and equipment were smashed and burned . Echoing Trump's long-standing calls that the press were the enemy of the people, rioters scrawled \" Murder the media ,\" on a Capitol doorway. A rioter murdered a police officer with a fire extinguisher. Another rioter was shot dead by a police officer while trying to break into House Speaker Nancy Pelosi 's chambers. In perhaps the most indelible image , rioters commandeered a scaffold and used it to take down an American flag and replace it with a Trump \"Make America Great Again\" flag.\n\nThis was the catastrophic and prophetic culmination of the Make America Great Again myth.\n\nEver since Trump descended the escalator in Trump Tower in 2015 to announce his presidential campaign with vicious, racist rhetoric and the tagline \"Make America Great Again,\" pundits and journalists have struggled to understand his appeal and the unthinking passion he inspired in the conservative base of the Republican Party and whether there was any true meaning or substance to what has been called Trumpism. The routine error in this effort has been to treat Trumpism as a fact to be understood intellectually or to be disputed . (Not to say that refuting his lies is pointless.)\n\nAs the right-wing billionaire Peter Thiel once said about understanding Trump , \"I think one thing that should be distinguished here is that the media is always taking Trump literally. It never takes him seriously, but it always takes him literally.\"\n\nThiel attempted to spin taking Trump \"seriously\" as meaning that his supporters heard his bombastic lies and racist jibes and thought about them in concrete policy terms. That was also wrong. Trump's supporters were not taking his words either literally or seriously, they were taking them mythically. When Trump entered the political fray in 2015, he gave the supporters of the conservative movement that came to dominate the Republican Party since the end of World War II a political myth they could die for. And myths, for the believer, cannot be refuted.\n\nA political myth is a narrative cast in dramatic form that provides a practical explanation of present events to a specific group at a time or place. Political myths provide meaning, direction and purpose through an interpretation of what the group of believers takes to be reality. They mythologize and interpret real events, and historical facts can be altered to suit the myth's purpose.\n\nThere are many kinds of political myths. There are foundation myths, like the Myth of the American Founding Fathers and the 1776 Revolution, the Roman Foundation Myth or the Soviet Myth of the October Revolution. And there are other political organizing myths, like the Myth of Norman Yoke , the Confederate Lost Cause Myth or the Myth of the U.S. Constitution .\n\nBut what Trump presents under the banner of \"Make America Great Again\" is an apocalyptic, or eschatological, myth. It is a myth foretelling a great and cataclysmic future event where deliverance will arrive through the exertion and sacrifice of the believers. The present order will be swept away and either a new one will take its place or an older order will be majestically restored.\n\n\"Politicians have used you and stolen your votes,\" Trump said while campaigning in 2016. \"They have given you nothing. I will give you everything. I will give you what you've been looking for for 50 years. I'm the only one.\"\n\nThe French syndicalist theorist Georges Sorel provided the most detailed explanation and theory for eschatological political myths in his 1908 book, \"Reflections on Violence,\" which focused on socialism and the myth of the general strike.\n\nMyths like Make America Great Again contain \"all the strongest inclinations of a people, of a party or of a class,\" according to Sorel, that \"give an aspect of complete reality to the hopes of immediate action upon which the reform of the will is founded.\" They \"are not descriptions of things but expressions of a will to act.\" And believers \"always picture their coming action in the form of images of battle in which their cause is certain to triumph.\" These myths \"cannot be refuted,\" since they just reflect \"the convictions of a group.\"\n\nThese myths are also not to be confused with utopian stories, which \"direct men's minds towards reforms.\" Myths like Make America Great Again do no such thing but instead provide a narrative to \"lead men to prepare themselves for a combat which will destroy the existing state of things.\"\n\nTrump, from the beginning, as many have noted, had no specific policy program while running for president outside of symbolic proposals to build a wall on the Mexican border, ban Muslims from entering the country and let police beat up anti-racism protesters. But those symbolic proposals, along with his violent and racist rhetoric, galvanized the Republican Party's conservative base in a manner his primary competitors could not.\n\nThere was never a policy vision for a Trump administration, but he promised that his election would bring a glorious future for conservatives. But that's because he was not promising a presidential administration in any real sense. He promised a future in which he alone would make America great again by smashing the left, siccing security forces on Latin American immigrants, Black people and Muslims, and protecting and glorifying his supporters.\n\nThe MAGA myth urges immediate action to \"take back our country\" from, as Trump said in July, a \"left-wing cultural revolution ... designed to overthrow the American Revolution.\" This battle should be waged \"without apology,\" he said then.\n\n\"This country will be everything that our citizens have hoped for, for so many years,\" Trump said, \"and that our enemies fear.\"\n\nThis must happen because it is the white conservatives who are the true victims of a liberal elite that disdains them.\n\n\"We're all victims,\" Trump said on Dec. 5 about his reelection loss. \"Everybody here, all these thousands of people here tonight, they're all victims, every one of you.\"\n\nPrior to the election, National Review Editor-in-Chief Rich Lowry justified support for Trump because he was \"the only middle finger available\" that conservatives could \"brandish against the people who've assumed they have the whip hand in American culture.\"\n\nThese themes of victimhood from a leftist elite have suffused conservatism since religious, business and white racist conservatives came together in the middle of the 20th century in reaction to the New Deal, the civil rights movement and the women's and gay rights movements.\n\nThe John Birch Society, Sen. Joseph McCarthy (R-Wis.), Southern segregationists and countless others who helped create and fund the conservative movement propagated conspiracies of a secret communist cabal that included everyone from President Dwight Eisenhower to Chief Justice Earl Warren to Martin Luther King Jr. And, more recently, after the election of the first Black president , the tea party movement organized conservatives to \"take back our country\" while donning the symbols of the American Revolution, such as the Gadsden Flag and tri-corner hats.\n\nThis attitude helped to build and create the Republican Party coalition that won five out of six presidential elections from 1968 to 1988 and control of both chambers of Congress in 1994. But since then the party has increasingly relied on either non-democratic or un-representative elements of the American political system, such as the Electoral College, the U.S. Senate , the judicial branch and gerrymandering, to gain and hold power. The most glaring statistic to show this is that Republicans have now lost the popular vote in seven out of the last eight presidential races. They also have now lost the popular vote in four successive presidential elections, a feat surpassed only by the five straight wins by Democrats Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman. Conservatives, and specifically white conservatives, are increasingly a political minority. And they know it.\n\nTrump's Make America Great Again myth arrived for this weakened conservatism beset by its failure to reverse the advance of a multiracial democracy as a new vision of a future where all conservatives will win and all liberals would not only be defeated but imprisoned. \"Lock them all up,\" Trump said on the campaign trail in 2020. The present order of both parties would be swept away, and the old order would be restored. Just as Sorel described.\n\nWhere conservatives in the tea party acted out their drama by appropriating the mythical imagery of the American Revolution, Trump replaced this attire with symbols of the apocalyptic future he was promising. Goodbye, tri-corner hats. Hello, Make America Great Again baseball caps . Put down the Gadsden flag and pick up a Trump MAGA banner . By the end of Trump's 2020 reelection campaign, his rallies displayed the Thin Blue Line flag more prominently than the actual Red, White and Blue .\n\nThe MAGA myth was made real when, against all odds, Trump shocked the media and Democrats and won the 2016 election, despite losing the popular vote. He had promised deliverance, and he had delivered. Trump would go on to describe that night at his subsequent rallies. This was a recitation of his victory as a dramatic narrative: a myth. The message is clear: Trump won where no one else could, and America was Great Again because of him. Trump was by himself the realization of the myth. As he said in 2016, \"I alone can fix it.\" Naturally, his reelection campaign picked Keep America Great as its new motto. Removal of Trump through democratic elections had become synonymous with the fall of the republic.\n\nBut Trump did lose reelection. As this complicated the MAGA myth, it could not possibly be true. Trump, through his symbiotic relationship with his base of supporters, both fueled their wildest fantasies by rejecting his loss with a steady stream of lies and amplified his supporters' conspiracies on social media. These lies had to be true because America had to be Made Great Again, his supporters believed.\n\n\"People who are living in this world of myths are secure from all refutation,\" Sorel wrote.\n\nAnd so Trump summoned his supporters to Washington on Wednesday to a rally meant to stop Congress from certifying President-elect Joe Biden's victory. It would be a day to \"save America,\" according to Trump, and \"Stop the Steal!\"\n\n\"Be there, will be wild!\" Trump tweeted .\n\nThis was the moment that the Make America Great Again myth had prepared his supporters for. It was time for them to \"take our country back.\" We have all seen what happened next.\n\nAfter the sack of the U.S. Capitol, which led to the deaths of four rioters and one police officer, Fox News contributor and Trump ally Pete Hegseth defended the rioters by quoting one of them he had talked to who said they now saw themselves as \"a born-again American.\"\n\nThe catastrophic Make America Great Again myth came to fruition, and it played out on Capitol Hill. What it ultimately amounted to is not clear, but that is beside the point, as Sorel argued when he defended the myth of the general strike and its utility for socialism.\n\n\"Even if the only result of the idea of the general strike was to make the socialist conception more heroic, it should on that account alone be looked upon as having an incalculable value,\" Sorel wrote.\n\nThe same holds true for the Make America Great Again myth. Non-believers, however, will have to wait to see what catastrophe it anticipates next."

      "text": "Dr. Martin Luther King Knew How to Make America Great Again\n\nHealth, entertainment and LGBT writer\n\nToday is Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, unless you live in, say, Biloxi, Mississippi, which faced backlash from the Twitterverse when it chose to whitewash the holiday by calling it \"Great Americans Day\" last week.\n\nKing was a great American. Many of us-I'd love to say \"all of us,\" but the way this country is turning I am not so confident anymore-learned about his incredible contributions to the Civil Rights and human rights movements in school. I'll choose optimism and count on President-elect Donald Trump not revoking February's designation as Black History Month, and in this spirit we can assume children will continue to learn more about Dr. King and many other truly Great Americans of African descent in schools next month.\n\nBut of all we're taught about King, the superior sitcom Blackish reminded us in last week's remarkable episode \"Lemons\" that there's much we haven't been taught. In the episode, teenager Junior (Marcus Scribner) learns under his grandfather's (Laurence Fishburne) tutorship that King had a radical side, that his words were not all abstract, not all theoretical, not all \"Dream-y,\" but critical, incisive and that they inspired social action. Not talk, action.\n\nFrom the video above, which I just discovered this morning, I learned that King's prescient vision allowed him a kind of cross-temporal X-ray vision that allowed him to see us directly, and to issue an urgent call to arms.\n\nThis is it, America. We could be on the cusp of a revolution-one that defies the will of the vast majority of us, one that undermines the spirit of the United States Constitution. Are we going to just sit by and watch it happen?\n\nKing's words:\n\nAmerica, be true to what you said on paper. If I lived in China or even Russia or any totalitarian country, maybe I could understand some of these illegal injunctions. Maybe I could understand the denial of some basic First Amendment privileges because they haven't committed themselves to that over there. But somewhere I read about the Freedom of Assembly. Somewhere I read of the Freedom of Speech. Somewhere I read of the Freedom of Press. Somewhere I read that the greatness of America is the right to protest for rights. So just as I say that we aren't going to let dogs or water hoses turn us around, we aren't going to let any injunction turn us around.\n\nYesterday, Washington Post columnist Margaret Sullivan wrote that \"a hellscape of lies and distorted reality awaits journalists covering President Trump.\" Anyone familiar with congressionally protected First Amendment rights and who saw last week's disastrous press conference at which Donald Trump reportedly filled the room with hired staff to cheer, applaud and laugh on command, and where he refused to allow reporters from CNN and BuzzFeed to ask questions, calling the latter \"a failing pile of garbage.\"\n\nTrump, it should be noted, champions a number of highly questionable media outlets: The National Enquirer, long regarded as one of the nation's most salacious tabloids, allegedly paid to suppress a story that could have harmed Donald Trump's campaign . ( Here's why .)\n\n. @FoxNews will be re-running \"Objectified: Donald Trump,\" the ratings hit produced by the great Harvey Levin of TMZ, at 8:00 P.M. Enjoy!\n\nTrump has sung the praises of the TMZ and its founder Harvey Levin for the very reason one should expect Trump to sing anyone's praises-because \"the great Harvey Levin of TMZ\" produced a hyperbolic, flattering biography of Trump for Fox News .\n\nAnd of course, Trump hired Stephen K. Bannon, the mastermind behind alt-right tabloid Breitbart , to be his chief strategist. Among Breitbart 's most notable news stories:\n\nLate in the evening of November 9, 2016, as the election was being called for Donald J. Trump, Breitbart Tech Editor Milo Yiannopoulos-who had run a year-long \"Dangerous Faggot\" tour of university campuses in part meant to recruit college-aged voters for Donald Trump, and who was selected by the Republican Party leadership to host a \"Gays for Trump\" rally at the 2016 GOP convention-issued this message through his InstaGram account: Welcome to the Trumpenreich.\n\nPeople have asked why Yiannopoulos matters. Simply put, because he is the direct link between the neo-Nazi alt-right movement leaders who have endorsed and advanced Trump and Trump's strategist, Steve Bannon, who ran Breitbart when Yiannopoulos, his public persona and his messaging were cultivated at the supposed news organization.\n\nMeanwhile, anyone who has paid attention knows that Trump has waged a war on all legitimate media, most specifically The New York Times , the Washington Post and most recently CNN and BuzzFeed, the latter of whose full legitimacy, to be fair, is still questioned by many other than Trump.\n\nWe need to understand the principles of Newspeak and doublespeak and doublethink , described in plain and easy-to-understand English by Nineteen Eighty - Four and Animal Farm author George Orwell. It's not theory: it's being used in practice today.\n\nWe need to understand the difference between legitimate news media organizations and those that are illegitimate. Without waging a personal attack on President-elect Trump, his chosen organizations frequently are the antithesis of legitimacy: they emphasize, as he does, salaciousness and scandal. He thrives on salaciousness and scandal, unless the salacious details are targeted toward him, as per the BuzzFeed dossier rumors that brought about a #GoldenShowers scandal-which, all of us must know, Trump would have promoted with gleeful schadenfreude had the rumors been about Hillary Clinton, Mitt Romney or any of his other once-foes.\n\nSpeaking of Clinton, we also must understand what the Trump campaign-make no mistake, the incoming administration still operates as a media campaign-is doing, and what even the most legitimate journalists are facilitating.\n\nHillary Clinton lost the United States presidential election on November 9, 2016. On that date, Clinton issued a concession speech. She threw in the towel. She bowed out gracefully, and on 60 Minutes days later, Trump himself said that Clinton \"did some bad things,\" but that the Clintons are \"good people,\" and that he planned to move on with the work of the presidency and not be distracted by the scandal.\n\nYet, frequently when Trump has backed himself into a corner with his own words, he has gone back to blaming Clinton, as he did in last week's press conference. And it's hardly just him. Kellyanne Conway and, increasingly, Reince Prebus and Mike Pence speak on Trump's behalf in television interviews. In these interviews, whether for CNN, The View or a Sunday-morning politico show such as Meet the Press or Face the Nation , these spokespeople speak of Trump's remarkable strength. When challenged to give a reasonable explanation for any of a myriad of Trump's frequently bizarre pronouncements-such as asking \"is this Nazi Germany?\" or posturing to use nuclear weapons via Twitter-these people inevitably invoke the name of Hillary Clinton. Which makes no sense at this point. And yet the media always, always let it happen.\n\nJournalists need to do better. Hillary Clinton is no longer Donald Trump's political rival. Journalists should not allow Trump or his mouthpieces to divert conversation about his words and his actions post-November 9 to Hillary Clinton, and yet they always do.\n\nThe news media have been accused of \"liberal bias\" for decades now. That's not going to change. Now they are being accused by Donald Trump and his team of paid supporters of \"fake news.\" It's not bias anymore; it's \"fake news,\" while Breitbart , TMZ and the National Enquirer and, less frequently but equally questionable, Fox News are framed as existing solely to smear Honorable Public Servant Donald Trump's good name. Legitimate reporters and their employing organizations should let these criticisms roll off their backs if they are confident they are reporting facts, yet like Trump, they show their thin skin and their egocentricity by allowing unfounded criticism to get to them and change how they operate.\n\nAll journalists need to take this in: Fair and balanced reporting is accurate and truthful reporting. Full stop.\n\nKellyanne Conway's entire job is to spin largely invented stories to detract from political scandals and rumors that her boss magnetizes to himself. More simply put, Conway does not tell the truth . She lies a lot. Respectable or not, it's actually her job to do this. It is not, however, news organizations' job to support her employment.\n\nWhen a source is consistently unreliable, as Conway is, why is she a fixture on television news and talk shows? What if, say, I called the New York Times every day and fed reporters absolute lies about terrorism and foreign influence on government actions-would the New York Times take my calls, much less report my lies? No, it would not do that. Why do CNN, broadcast network and other news organizations report Conway's constantly false or skewed-to-the-point-of-not-bearing-no-resemblance-to-reality words?\n\nFair and balanced reporting does not involve giving equal time to dependably unreliable sources simply because their opinions are contrary to facts and truth. Giving equal time to disinformation, in fact, undermines accurate, truthful reporting. Why do news organizations and journalists do it? I have no answer for that aside from \"ratings,\" and I've racked my brain over it.\n\nAll the media need to do better.\n\nWhen the only defense for Donald Trump now, two months after the election, two months after Hillary Clinton seems to have vanished deep into the woods of New England, begins with \"Well, Hillary Clinton...\" then there is no defense for Donald Trump. Period.\n\nDo I expect the media to do better? Not really-why would they? Just because their long-term solvency and our democracy are at stake? Ad revenue drives the news, as commerce drives everything in our capitalist world. But a handful of news organizations are still doing the work of the Fourth Estate-to keep the first three estates, the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government-honest and accountable. Yesterday, Bill Moyers issued a list of reliable news organizations:\n\nInvestigative reporting outlets to follow: @ProPublica , @Publici , @reveal , @CIRonline , @frontlinepbs , @MotherJones , https://t.co/1GGTS0bgx0\n\nResponsible American people who still have a stake in preserving the greatest and most unique aspects of what our country historically has been should become acquainted with these organizations and their reporters. And these organizations and those which should aspire to be more like them need to think very carefully before inviting spinmasters and propagandists to \"balance\" accurate reporting with disinformation.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

No. We are right now, all of us, all American people whether or not we feel it as acutely as we should today, where King was when he made his 1968 speech. He had a greater vision of what was to come. It has come. It's our decision whether or not to defend our freedoms. Our very Constitution is at stake.\n\nWell, I don't know what will happen now. We've got some difficult days ahead.

So I'm happy tonight, I'm not worried about anything, I'm not fearing any man.\n\nHappy Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.

      "text": "A Word For Christians Who Want To Make America Great Again\n\nFounder and Director of Christian Democrats of America\n\nFor months, like the rest of us, I have been hearing the word \"great\" thrown around a lot by Donald Trump and his supporters. \"Make America Great Again\" has been the Trump campaign mantra since day one, it was the theme of the Republican National Convention, and it has even become a baseball hat fashion statement.\n\nI have heard pastors, religious leaders and Christians across the country repeat this mantra, with all the implications it brings ― that things are bad now but they will be \"great\" when Trump is in charge. However, I believe it is time to ask the question, \"What is the Trump and the GOP definition of 'great'?\"\n\nEver since Trump first announced his candidacy and campaign slogan, I have been questioning what he means by \"great.\" If you want to make a country great again , then you obviously don't believe it is great now - a very negative point of view for any candidate for president of the United States, but it seems to be a popular stance to take this year for a segment of Americans.\n\nAs a person who has been a follower of Christ and involved in ministry on some level most of my life, it is important for me to fully understand what \"great\" means in Biblical terms, and I would also think this would be pretty important for most Christians.\n\n\"The things Jesus would consider \"making a country great\" is the polar opposite of everything the Trump GOP has put forward.\"\n\nWe don't always have a clear definition of a word in Biblical terms, however, Jesus addressed \"great\" very directly. He showed by example and taught exactly what characteristics we should value and consider \"great.\" Last I checked the word \"Christian\" literally means \"follower of Christ.\" His are the values we are supposed to be embracing, and He told us exactly what it means to make something or someone \"great.\"\n\nIn Mark 10:35-45, we have an account of James and John asking for more power and authority. They wanted to be given a place at God's right-hand in heaven, which is probably the highest power-position anyone has asked for (unless it is to be God Himself!).\n\nWhen the other disciples are indignant that they would ask this, Jesus told them greatness is measured by the scale of service and humility. He instructs that to be the greatest actually means to become lowly and centered on serving others, and this is not the only account of Christ's very specific teaching on this.\n\nHe washed the feet of his disciples as an example of leadership. In Matthew 23:11-12 He says the one who wants to be greatest must be the biggest servant of all and that anyone who humbles themselves will be exalted. He tells the rich young ruler that he should sell what he has and give it to the poor. Jesus was not saying every successful, rich or powerful person should give up having authority and sell all their possessions, but He spoke in parables and in examples that we could easily understand. By doing this He gets a strong point across about values and also characteristics that should be valued. He makes it clear what is and is not a \"great\" attitude.\n\nSo if you are a Christian who truly wants America to be great, and have decided to support or are considering supporting Trump, please consider this: Have you asked yourself if your definition of greatness, as defined by Christ, is the same as Trump's definition? When you compare the examples above with the example we have seen over the past months - at rallies and at the RNC, where the biggest unifying voice on any topic was one of hatred and contempt for the opposing party and their nominee, with the delegates and surrogates cursing, even now threatening, Hillary Clinton - the answer is obvious.\n\nWhen have we seen and heard a true call to service, kindness, hope or love? The things Jesus would consider \"making a country great\" is the polar opposite of everything the Trump GOP has put forward. First of all, a culture that is centered on unifying around hatefulness and anger is just about as anti-Christ as it can get. Consider this last, and probably most important, \"great\" that Jesus spoke of...\n\nMatthew 22:36-40 ― \"Teacher, which is the most important commandment in the law of Moses?\" Jesus replied, \"'You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, and all your mind.' This is the first and greatest commandment. A second is equally important: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' The entire law and all the demands of the prophets are based on these two commandments.\"\n\nThink about this for a minute.\n\nChrist is asked what the most important commandment is... with all His power and authority, He has a moment to tell those listening and those testing Him the answer to a question for the ages. His declaration is one of the most important and powerful statements ever made: LOVE. Love God, love your neighbor. His challengers then proceed to question who \"neighbor\" really is.\n\n\"The Trump culture has validated this type of heated rhetoric and brought it to a boiling point, so that it is acceptable to openly discriminate. Is this what being great means?\"\n\nWhen He uses a Samaritan as His example, He truly put to rest all arguments anyone in history would ever try to make about \"neighbor\" referring to only those within one's own race, background, fellowship, religion, etc. This is because Samaritans were not socially accepted - they were considered \"aliens\" in every way and one of the lowest of social statuses.\n\nWhen you believe Jesus is truly the Son of God, you must also believe this declaration is pretty important and not something that can be brushed under the rug. However, what Jesus says is the most powerful and important thing is not valued, at least not in word or action, by the Trump campaign and the current GOP. Power and strength are seen as defeating, pushing others aside, dividing and conquering, insulting those who come against you and bullying your way to the top - putting up walls and making sure no one takes advantage of us or gets too much help or mercy. But as a follower of Christ, I cannot concede that anything but what my Lord declared is the greatest thing is what we should do - LOVE.\n\nTo deny any other way but love is to deny Christ. He even said to love our enemies and He loved those who denied Him. However, the thing that He said is especially harmful is to deny Him and everything He said was most important, thus denying His very power and authority, yet still claim to embrace Him.\n\nHere is the thing: You cannot embrace something you completely stand against. Have you ever tried to touch two magnets together? They are polarized. They reject and repel each other. Well, that is how it is when people try to embrace Jesus yet reject Him, His commands and His greatness . Instead they are replacing His power with a false trust in earthly power - money, guns, control and hate.\n\nRecently, I was about to indulge in a frozen yogurt on a hot summer day and as I was stepping up to order the man in line before me was getting very anxious and upset at the cashier, saying his order was wrong. She had apparently heard his order wrong and he could not understand her well - she had a Hispanic accent and dark skin. He angrily told the manager she couldn't speak English. Finally, as his order was fulfilled, I apologized to the woman on behalf of all decent human beings in America, and saw the tears of hurt in her eyes.\n\nThe Trump culture has validated this type of heated rhetoric and brought it to a boiling point, so that it is acceptable to openly discriminate. Is this what being great means? That we can say anything, be politically incorrect to the point of it being acceptable to openly tear other people down because they look or sound or believe differently than we do?\n\nIs \"greatness\" revitalizing the torture program, discriminating on the basis of religion, separating families because our laws were so messed up they couldn't come here legally 15 years ago?\n\nIs it chanting \"lock her up\" and calling for \"Second Amendment Remedies\" about your political opponent, calling the opposing party candidate denigrating, sexist names?\n\nIs it inciting racism, violence, bullying your way to the top?\n\nAnd finally, is \"greatness\" giving more power, wealth, tax breaks to the wealthy while putting a harder burden on the poor, middle class? Is the \"again\" referring to a time before we had a social safety net at all?\n\n\"Is \"greatness\" giving more power, wealth, tax breaks to the wealthy while putting a harder burden on the poor, middle class?\"\n\nIf Christians truly want to make America greater, they would be calling for policies that make things easier on the hurting, oppressed populations, the poor, the homeless, poor neighborhoods and schools. They would focus their attentions on the things Jesus did, on answering the questions: how much love can we pour out here? How much acceptance can we give out there? What policies and what person or party is doing the most to take the burden off the poor and those who are vulnerable? Who is accepting of the poor wanderer, immigrant and does not want to separate families? Who wants to make sure more people who can't afford healthcare can get it, who can't afford food can get it? Who is offering some realistic options on ending injustice and suffering, offering more mercy to the prisoners?\n\nOne final word about Biblical greatness I will leave you with. In Isaiah 58, we find the description of a great nation and how a society becomes great . It talks about things like justice for the poor and oppressed, removing the hindrances to the poor, paying workers a fair wage. It even mentions providing the immigrant with shelter! Taking this into consideration, I pray, my fellow brothers and sisters, that we may be truly great as a nation, and that Christians in this nation will rise up and embrace the things the One they are following says are GREAT!\n\nIsaiah 58:1-12\n\n\"Shout it aloud, do not hold back. Raise your voice like a trumpet. Declare to my people their rebellion and to the descendants of Jacob their sins. For day after day they seek me out; they seem eager to know my ways, as if they were a nation that does what is right and has not forsaken the commands of its God. They ask me for just decisions and seem eager for God to come near them. 'Why have we fasted,' they say, 'and you have not seen it? Why have we humbled ourselves, and you have not noticed?'\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

With God's help over the next four years, we are going to lead this nation even higher.\"\n\nHe framed a series of policy proposals - many attacking civil rights for minorities and trans people - as part of God's plan for the nation. He called on Congress \"to pass a bill permanently banning and criminalizing sex changes on children,\" proclaiming \"our message to every child in America is that you are perfect, exactly the way God made you.\"\n\nIn some ways, Trump is the kind of political leader the Christian right has been seeking for decades. He has fully championed the movement's long-held policy priorities: overturning Roe v. Wade , pushing prayer in schools , and curbing LGBTQ+ rights. Now he is taking their movement even further, embedding right-wing Christian ideology into every facet of federal policy.\n\nIt's a \"broad coalition across Christian denominations,\" says journalist Talia Lavin, \"whose goal is an extremely socially restrictive agenda.\" Lavin, author of \"Wild Faith: How the Christian Right Is Taking Over America,\" argues that today's Christian right is more receptive to authoritarianism than previous generations. \"They've reached a kind of acme or apotheosis of their power and influence, where that sort of attitude towards democracy has attained real relevance in the way we're governed.\"\n\nOn this week's episode of The Intercept Briefing, Lavin and Intercept reporter Jessica Washington examine the Christian right's growing influence, its long-term strategy, and what, if anything, can be done to curb their vision for the country.\n\nWashington warns that many liberals dismiss Trump's alliance to the Christian right as fringe, missing its deep political impact. \"While it's this convenient political organizing tool, it is also a deeply held belief,\" she says - one that rejects the idea that Black people and queer people have a rightful place in American leadership. Trump, she adds, validates the belief that only white Christian males are the true inheritors of the nation's legacy. \"Trump is both a product of and an accelerant of this movement.\"\n\nCountering the rapid lurch toward Christian nationalism, Washington argues, requires solidarity. \"We all have to band together and fight this together. And not allowing ourselves to be siloed into different issues. And recognizing that this is an attack on everyone who doesn't fit this very specific mold.\"\n\nLavin calls for active resistance - a \"joyous cacophony\" - to the Christian right's war on diversity, on the poor, and democracy: \"We're gonna be gender rebels. We're not going to accept the gutting of social services. We're not going to accept a king.\" Rather than doomscrolling, she encourages people to do \"something, anything - feeding someone, attending a protest - whatever it is. All of that is how we win.\"\n\nListen to the full conversation of The Intercept Briefing on Apple Podcasts , Spotify , or wherever you listen.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren't on the beat?\n\nThe kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but it is not easy, cheap, or profitable.

What happened to it? Where did it go? How has it flown away?\" Three questions thrown down from the altar of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio, by Rudy Giuliani, former mayor of New York City, patron saint of 9/11, to the 2,472 Republican delegates assembled on the Floor of the Quicken Loans Arena, also known as the Q. The day's theme was MASA, Make America Safe Again, part of #MAGA, a popular hashtag among Trump's online supporters, who call themselves the #TrumpTrain. MAGA is an acronym for the candidate's slogan: Make America Great Again. The sound of MAGA, said aloud, brings to mind a pagan deity. Like: In the name of all that is good and decent, MAGA commands you, go forth and slay the barbarian hordes!\n\nBefore last week, I would have thought it naïve to ask what happened to America. But the holy terror of Giuliani's speech (and please do watch it in full ) has made the question worth asking.\n\nVideo of Rudy Giuliani's address to the RNC remixed by internet satirist Vic Berger.\n\nNear the edge of the Floor of the Q, I found myself talking to Laurence Schiff, an Arizona delegate from the Kingman area. Schiff is a psychiatrist who heads up mental health programs in seven prisons, a Tea Party man, an early convert from Cruz to Trump, and a self-styled historian with his own talk radio show. He looked like a country doctor in late middle age, his neat, formal clothes neither new nor worn, his mouth turned slightly downward. His moist, earnest eyes fixed me through his glasses.\n\nSchiff quickly turned our conversation to the breadth of MAGA's appeal. \"Donald Trump appeals more than you'd suspect to Latins and to minorities,\" he said. \"My wife is Latin. She is the biggest Trumpster around. Latins are extremely family-oriented. They tend to be pro-life. With African-Americans, they tend to be very law and order.\" At this point, I hushed Schiff. Giuliani had taken the stage. He began by thanking the police officers in Dallas, Baton Rogue, and Cleveland. Giuliani's love for the police was absolute and ecumenical: \"Black, white, Latino, of every race, every color, every creed, every sexual orientation ...\" His questions came as an improvised solo, capping a steady build with a flourish of aggravation:\n\n\"It's time to make America safe again. It's time to make America one again. One America!\"\n\nGiuliani verified the count with a wag of his index finger. One.\n\n\"There's a war on the police,\" Schiff said, turning to me.\n\n\"What happened to ...\" Giuliani began, his pistons turning over once, not starting, and firing back up. \"There's no black America,\" he said, waving to his left. \"There's no white America,\" he waved to his right. \"There is just ... Ah-mehr-ick-ahh !\" Two hands stretched out and throttled the air, as though Giuliani was a sorcerer and America a chimera or genie that he was summoning up from the depths. Then came his three questions, shouted over the cheers. \"America!\" The voice high and thrillingly urgent: \"What happened to it? Where did it go? How has it flown away?\"\n\n\"This is the most electrifying speech of the night,\" said Sandra Dowling, an Arizona delegate. She had cropped red hair, an assortment of pro-Trump pins, and a steady, self-assured voice. She was around Schiff's age, with a doctorate in education, and she had once served as Maricopa County superintendent of schools.\n\n\"I like the passion, the intensity,\" she said of Giuliani. \"The whole way that he sucks everybody in. He's not lecturing to people here. He's pulling them in and making them part of it.\"\n\nBy this time, Giuliani had moved on, from domestic to foreign, police to military. \"To defeat Islamic extremist terrorists, we must put them on defense,\" he said. \"If they are at war with us, which they have declared. We must commit ourselves to unconditional victory against them!\" And from there, to the Iran deal, to Hillary Clinton, to Benghazi. He paused, taking in the thunderous chants of \"USA! USA! USA!\"\n\nThe followers of MAGA tend toward three-syllable chants, with equal and forceful emphasis given to each syllable. The \"USA!\" chant is a sunny reprise from more issue-specific chants like \"Lock Her Up!\" and the edgy \"All Lives Matter!\" (Matter, as delivered, sounds more like \"Mahrr!\") Of the three letters in USA, it is the A, America!, that matters most to them, not the States, certainly not the United. The \"U.S.\" part of the chant may be a case of linguistic atavism, an immigrant's nostalgia for the country she has long since left. That country is, to put it plainly, the past - some of it experienced, some of it romanticized, most of it imagined.\n\n\"Now listen to this!\" said Dowling. \"This is the only time, all day long, that all of the delegates have come together. This is what a convention is supposed to be about.\"\n\n\"Overcoming your differences, you mean?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"Look at this like a pie. You may not like the taste of the rest of the pie. But if you can find just one little sliver that you can latch onto, then you can latch onto the campaign. And that's what I think he's doing. He's going through here and he's just pulling in slivers. For everybody here. You can feel it.\"\n\n\"To a certain degree, we're props,\" Schiff said, cutting in. \"Something that's made for television.\" He seemed to be suggesting that the convention wasn't really about the Floor. He might or might not have been suggesting that it was a televised simulacrum of a bottom-up democracy, with the delegates shipped in on coach flights and diesel buses to be fed at the Marriott and spurred into partisan ecstasies by the ship. \"Whip\" was the word on the door of a kind of control room in the hallway behind the Floor, where a few tall and formidable-looking men in suits marshaled an army of cheerleaders in orange baseball hats (convention ops), white hats (regional whips), yellow hats (state whips), and green hats (alternate whips). Many looked to be college age. They all had earpieces and \"Making America Great, Est. 1776\" stitched on the back of their color-ranked hats. Like the Borg on Star Trek, the word \"whip\" can refer to any single member of the operation, or the machine as a whole.\n\nSchiff seemed to have an internal whip, a governor who guided him back to the party line. After referring to himself as a prop, he paused and shifted gears. \"You need 50, 60 million votes to win the presidency,\" he said. \"I've made a study of this. That's why I think Donald Trump is the only one who can win.\"\n\nGiuliani, amplified, skull-headed, enormous on the screen: ... She is in favor of even taking Syrian refugees, even though the Islamic State has told us they are going to put their operatives in with the Syrian refugees, operatives who are terrorists ...\n\nI asked Dowling which sliver of the Trump pie was hers. She said: \"I want somebody, when they walk into the room, he or she, I want everyone in the world to know that they're in charge ...\"\n\n... they come into Western Europe, they come here, and kill us!\n\nDowling: \"I want everyone to know that when they speak, the rest of the world listens.\"\n\n... there's no next election. This is it! There's no more time for us left!\n\n\"And with Donald Trump, the rest of the world will listen, and they will pay attention. National security is a big issue for me. I'm looking for strength, courage, and chutzpah.\"\n\n... No more time to repeat our mistakes of the Clinton-Obama years. Donald Trump is the agent of change.\n\n\"I want somebody to go in and go toe to toe with the president of North Korea and tell him the way it is and not be told, 'Get on your hands and knees and beg me.'\"\n\n... He will be the leader of the change we need.\n\n\"I don't want to be begging anymore.\" Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani delivers a speech on the first day of the Republican National Convention on July 18, 2016 at the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio. Photo: Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nFormer New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani delivers a speech on the first day of the Republican National Convention on July 18, 2016 at the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nRudolph William Lewis Giuliani did not serve as one of the principal investigators of the 9/11 attacks. He did not kill the man who carried them out. As New York City's mayor on 9/11, Giuliani led the response, the cleanup, and the first phase of rebuilding. He came on the scene as the leader of a wounded city-state and emerged from the ashes a minor Republican statesman. His main role was to speak about the tragedy on TV. His first September 11, 2001, press conference was given while walking down the street, heading downtown less than an hour after Flight 11 crashed into the North Tower. \"People should remain calm,\" he said. He gave two more press conferences that afternoon and evening. On September 23, he appeared at a prayer service at Yankee Stadium alongside Oprah Winfrey, who called him \"America's Mayor.\" On September 24, he went on David Letterman. On October 1, he gave a moving and humane address to the United Nations. On that day, he did not talk about radical Islamic terrorism . Just terrorism - that one word was enough.\n\nHaving established a solid link with 9/11 in the public mind, Giuliani's relationship with the event underwent a shift, from mourner to owner. By 2004, his finances and connections and political prospects much improved, Giuliani was talking about 9/11 as though it were his property, an exotic pet, an exhibit that could be packed up into a suitcase and displayed at his pleasure. He showed it off with a victim's righteousness and a prosecutor's zeal, and started doing some heavy spiritual lifting for the Republican Party. Last week in Cleveland, he extended his proprietary 9/11 halo to Trump, \"a man with a big heart.\" Trump, Giuliani said, had donated money to injured police and firefighters. Trump had done so anonymously, and he wasn't going to be happy with Giuliani for revealing his kindness in public. \"Every time New York suffered a tragedy,\" Giuliani said, \"Donald Trump was there to help.\"\n\nGiuliani had assumed the mayoralty by mastering big-city racial politics. He was the electoral embodiment of Travis Bickle's \"Someday a real rain will come and wash all this scum off the streets\" and Howard Beale, the-mad-as-hell news anchor. Giuliani had no problem with people of other races. His problem was with the panhandlers , the thugs , and the squeegee men. Patrick Moses Dorismond, who was shot by a plainclothes NYPD officer, was an actual altar boy. But to Giuliani (then running against Hillary Clinton for the Senate), he was no altar boy , he was a man with a propensity to violence and a sealed juvenile court record, which Giuliani proceeded to release. An arrest that happened more than 10 years before, when Dorismond was 13 years old, was, to Giuliani, highly relevant. The case of Amadou Diallo, the unarmed immigrant from Guinea who was shot 41 times by plainclothes NYPD, was, meanwhile, unfortunate. All four shooters were acquitted. Some years later, when Giuliani was no longer mayor, one of the officers was promoted.\n\n(And yes, it is worth remembering the thousands of crime victims, disproportionately African-American, who died in New York and other big cities during the crime wave that ran from the mid-1980s through the early 1990s. Crime rates fell in those cities, most dramatically in New York, during Giuliani's 1994-2001 mayoralty. How much credit Giuliani deserves for that life-saving reduction is the subject of much debate. Less debatable is the effect of his \"get tough\" approach on the incarceration rate of black men, the killings of black men by police, and his attempts, in the Dorismond case and others, to turn those dead black men into votes.)\n\nAs for the Muslims, Giuliani said, he would limit his rage to the barbaric terrorists who attacked us ... people and forces who hijacked not just airplanes, but a great religion and turned it into a creed of terrorism dedicated to killing all of us. Those last words are from his previous red-meat speech, delivered on the first day of the 2004 RNC, in New York City. Giuliani didn't want to kill all the Muslims, only the bad ones, the ones who are with the terrorists . He compared the pre-9/11 view of Islamic terrorism to Europe's appeasement of Hitler during the run-up to World War II.\n\nLong before Cruz dreamed aloud about carpet-bombing the Islamic State, Giuliani had taken the semi-sublimated racial animus of the Republican Party's George Wallace wing (\"Stand Up for America\" was Wallace's 1968 slogan) and attached it to a new and more fearsome target, al Qaeda. He used it to frame the country's Bush-era adventures as a kind of war of righteous vengeance. The new war sounded at times like a holy war. Once, George W. Bush used the word \"crusade.\"\n\nOn Monday night, standing on the high altar of MAGA, Giuliani defined America's enemy this way:\n\n\"For the purposes of the media, I did not say all of Islam. I did not say most of Islam. I said Islamic extremist terrorism. You know who you are and we're coming to get you.\"\n\nFor the purposes of the media. Either Giuliani wanted to make it clear that he was only talking about a subset of Islam. Or he wanted to make clear his wish to declare war on all of Islam, and his frustration at not being able to raise this flag in public. I believe that he was doing both, at once. Unlike Trump, Giuliani has a prosecutor's mastery of rhetoric. He knows how to communicate a message and deny it at the same time.\n\nHere is Giuliani on Larry King talking about Iraq during his brief run at the presidency in 2006:\n\nThe whole strategy has to be a strategy of not just pacifying places but holding them, and holding them for some period of time. It reminds me a little, on a much bigger scale, of what I had to do to reduce crime in New York City. We had to not just go into neighborhoods and make them safe, which the city had been doing for years, but the city had been going in there, making them safe, and then leaving. ... I'd take out Saddam Hussein in a second again ... here's what I would change. Do it with more troops. Maybe 150,000.\n\nMaking them safe. We need someone to bring law and order to the neighborhoods .\n\nTrump, who has taken advice from Roger Stone and Paul Manafort, two of Richard Nixon's henchmen, has borrowed from Giuliani's classic obsessions and added illegal immigration to his witch's brew. Trump may not know or care to know that Barack Obama has spent eight years pounding on al Qaeda, not only in Iraq and Afghanistan but also through the use of drones and other covert campaigns in Syria, Somalia, and Yemen. In his two terms, George W. Bush ordered 49 drone strikes against al Qaeda and Taliban-associated targets in the tribal areas of Pakistan. Obama, during his first two years in office, ordered 174. These are facts, but to Trump and Giuliani, they may not matter. After all, what good does killing radical Islamic terrorists do if Obama refuses to call the enemy by its name ?\n\nThe crowd in Cleveland was primed for Giuliani. They howled with pleasure upon hearing from Milwaukee's sheriff, David Clark, that \"blue lives matter.\" The slogan sounded more credible when enunciated by an African-American. Clark has told the people of Milwaukee that obtaining their own firearms is preferable to calling 911, part of \"a duty to protect yourself and your family.\" On Monday, he lumped together Ferguson and Baltimore (mass street protests) with Baton Rouge (the lone-wolf murder of three police officers) as \"a collapse of the social order ... I call it anarchy.\"\n\nThis was Giuliani's task on Monday: Raise the emotional temperature. Melt down the differences that separate the factions. Fuse them into a mass. Political conventions customarily open with red-meat speeches, but providence saw fit to disrupt the opening nights of 2012 (Tampa, Florida) and 2008 (St. Paul, Minnesota) with hurricanes (Isaac, Gustav). The opening night of the RNC's 2004 convention had also featured Rudy Giuliani, at Madison Square Garden, with a presidential run still in his future. \"They heard from us,\" he said, claiming victory in Iraq in Afghanistan.\n\nThe Giuliani of 2016 was more familiar, with less to lose. The climax of his speech came about a minute in, just before the three questions about the whereabouts of America. He was talking about the police and the firemen:\n\n... when they come in to save you. They don't care what color you are! When they come to save your life, they don't ask if you're black or white. They just come! To save you!\n\nSave you from who? Was Giuliani talking about Ferguson, or Baton Rouge, or Dallas, or the World Trade Center, or al Qaeda, or the Islamic State, or Benghazi, or the mother whose son was killed by an undocumented immigrant, or the Islamic State operative who had come in over the porous border with Mexico? (This last scenario has never actually happened.) Giuliani was talking about all of these things, and injecting into each of them the image of two burning towers, and the wall that Trump would build around his republic of Make America Great Again to keep all of them out.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Toxic Nostalgia, From Putin to Trump to the Trucker Convoys\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nWar is reshaping our world. Will we harness that urgency for climate action or succumb to a final, deadly oil and gas boom?\n\nA \"Make America Great Again\" baseball cap rests on the knee of a person at the \"Rally to Protect Our Elections\" event in Phoenix, on July 24, 2021.\n\nNostalgia for empire is what seems to drive Vladimir Putin - that and a desire to overcome the shame of punishing economic shock therapy imposed on Russia at the end of the Cold War. Nostalgia for American \"greatness\" is part of what drives the movement Donald Trump still leads - that and a desire to overcome the shame of having to face the villainy of white supremacy that shaped the founding of the United States and mutilates it still. Nostalgia is also what animates the Canadian truckers who occupied Ottawa for the better part of a month, wielding their red-and-white flags like a conquering army, evoking a simpler time when their consciences were undisturbed by thoughts of the bodies of Indigenous children, whose remains are still being discovered on the grounds of those genocidal institutions that once dared to call themselves \"schools.\"\n\nThis is not the warm and cozy nostalgia of fuzzily remembered childhood pleasures; it's an enraged and annihilating nostalgia that clings to false memories of past glories against all mitigating evidence.\n\nAll these nostalgia-based movements and figures share a longing for something else, something which may seem unrelated but is not. A nostalgia for a time when fossil fuels could be extracted from the earth without uneasy thoughts of mass extinction, or children demanding their right to a future, or Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports, like the one just released yesterday, that reads, in the words of United Nations Secretary General António Guterres, like an \"atlas of human suffering and a damning indictment of failed climate leadership.\" Putin, of course, leads a petrostate, one that has defiantly refused to diversify its economic dependence on oil and gas, despite the devastating effect of the commodity roller coaster on its people and despite the reality of climate change. Trump is obsessed with the easy money that fossil fuels offer and as president made climate denial a signature policy .\n\nThe Canadian truckers, for their part, not only chose idling 18-wheelers and smuggled jerry cans as their protest symbols, but the leadership of the movement is also deeply rooted in the extra-dirty oil of the Alberta tar sands. Before it was the \"freedom convoy,\" many of these same players staged the dress rehearsal known as United We Roll , a 2019 convoy that combined a zealous defense of oil pipelines, opposition to carbon pricing, anti-immigrant xenophobia, and explicit nostalgia for a white, Christian Canada.\n\nThough petrodollars underwrite these players and forces, it's critical to understand that oil is a stand-in for a broader worldview, a cosmology deeply entwined with Manifest Destiny and the Doctrine of Discovery, which ranked human as well as nonhuman life inside a rigid hierarchy, with white Christian men at the top. Oil, in this context, is the symbol of the extractivist mindset: not only a perceived God-given right to keep extracting fossil fuels, but also the right to keep taking whatever they want, leave poison behind, and never look back.\n\nThis is why the fast-moving climate crisis represents not just an economic threat to people invested in the extractive sectors but also a cosmological threat to the people invested in this worldview. Because climate change is the Earth telling us that nothing is free; that the age of (white, male) human \"dominion\" has ended; that there is no such thing as a one-way relationship comprised only of taking; that all actions have reactions. These centuries of digging and spewing are now unleashing forces that make even the sturdiest structures created by industrial societies - coastal cities, highways, oil rigs - look vulnerable and frail. And within the extractivist mindset, that is impossible to accept.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nGiven their common cosmologies, it should come as no surprise that Putin, Trump, and the \"freedom convoys\" are reaching toward one another across disparate geographies and wildly different circumstances. So Trump praises Canada's \"peaceful movement of patriotic truckers, workers, and families protesting for their most basic rights and liberties\"; Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon cheer on Putin while the truckers sport their MAGA hats; Randy Hillier, a member of the Ontario Legislature who is one of the convoy's loudest supporters, declares on Twitter that \"Far more people have & will die from this shot [the Covid vaccines], than in the Russia/Ukraine war.\" And how about the Ontario restaurant that last week put on its daily specials board the announcement that Putin \"is not occupying Ukraine\" but standing up to the Great Reset , the Satanists, and \"fighting against the enslavement of humanity.\"\n\nThese alliances seem deeply weird and unlikely at first. But look a little closer, and it's clear that they are bound together by an attitude toward time, one that clings to an idealized version of the past and steadfastly refuses to face difficult truths about the future. They also share a delight in the exercise of raw power: the 18-wheeler vs. the pedestrian, the shouted manufactured reality vs. the cautious scientific report, the nuclear arsenal vs. the machine gun. This is the energy currently surging in many different spheres, starting wars, attacking seats of government, and defiantly destabilizing our planet's life support systems. This is the ethos at the root of so many democratic crises, geopolitical crises, and the climate crisis: a violent clinging to a toxic past and a refusal to face a more entangled and interrelational future, one bounded by the limits of what people and planet can take. It is a pure expression of what the late bell hooks often described, with a playful wink, as \"imperialist white-supremacist capitalist patriarchy\" - because sometimes all the big guns are needed to describe our world accurately.\n\nA rocket hits a residential building in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Feb. 26, 2022.\n\nThe most urgent political task at hand is to put enough pressure on Putin that he sees his criminal invasion of Ukraine as too great a risk to sustain. But that is only the barest of beginnings. \"There is a brief and rapidly closing window to secure a liveable future on the planet,\" said Hans-Otto Portner, co-chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change working group that organized the landmark report released this week. If there is a uniting political task of our time, it is to provide a comprehensive response to this conflagration of toxic nostalgia. And within a modern world birthed in genocide and dispossession, that requires laying out a vision for a future where we have never been before.\n\nThe leadership of our various countries, with very few exceptions, are nowhere near meeting this challenge. Putin and Trump are backward-facing, nostalgic figures, and they have plenty of company on the hard right. Jair Bolsonaro was elected by playing on nostalgia for Brazil's era of military rule, and the Philippines, alarmingly, is poised to elect Ferdinand Marcos Jr. as its next president, son of the late dictator who pillaged and terrorized his nation through much of the '70s and '80s. But this is not only a right-wing crisis. Many liberal standard bearers are deeply nostalgic figures too, offering as antidotes to surging fascism nothing but warmed-over neoliberalism, openly aligned with the predatory corporate interests - from Big Pharma to big banks - that have shredded living standards. Joe Biden was elected on the comforting promise of a return to pre-Trump normal, never mind that this was the same soil in which Trumpism grew. Justin Trudeau is the younger version of the same impulse: a shallow, attention-economy echo of his father, the late Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau. In 2015, Trudeau Jr.'s first statement on the world stage was \"Canada is back\"; Biden's, five years later, was \"America is back, ready to lead the world.\"\n\nWe will not defeat the forces of toxic nostalgia with these weak doses of marginally less toxic nostalgia. It's not enough to be \"back\"; we are in desperate need of new. The good news is that we know what it looks like to fight the forces enabling imperial aggression, right-wing pseudo-populism, and climate breakdown at the same time. It looks very much like a Green New Deal, a framework to get off fossil fuels by investing in family-supporting unionized jobs doing meaningful work, like building green affordable homes and good schools, starting with the most systematically abandoned and polluted communities first. And that requires moving away from the fantasy of limitless growth and investing in the labor of care and repair .\n\nThe Green New Deal - or the Red, Black, and Green New Deal - is our best hope for building a sturdy multiracial working-class coalition, based on finding common ground across divides. It also happens to be the best way to cut off the petrodollars flowing to people like Putin, since green economies that have beat the addiction to endless growth don't need imported oil and gas. And it's also how we cut off the oxygen to the pseudo-populism of Trump/Carlson/Bannon, whose bases are expanding because they are far better at harnessing the rage directed at Davos elites than the Democrats, whose leaders, for the most part, are those elites.\n\nRussia's invasion underlines the urgency of this kind of green transformation, but it also throws up new challenges. Before Russia's tanks started rolling, we were already hearing that the best way to stop Putin's aggression is to ramp up fossil fuel production in North America. Within hours of the invasion, every planet-torching project that the climate justice movement had managed to block over the past decade was being frantically rushed back onto the table by right-wing politicians and industry-friendly pundits: every canceled oil pipeline, every nixed gas export terminal, every protected fracking field, every Arctic drilling dream. Since Putin's war machine is funded with petrodollars, the solution we are told, is to drill, frack, and ship more of our own.\n\nThis is all a disaster capitalist charade of the kind of I have written about too many times before. First, China will keep buying Russian oil regardless of what happens in the Marcellus Shale or the Alberta tar sands. Second, the timelines are fantastical. There is no such thing as a short-term fossil fuel play. Every one of the projects being flogged as a solution to dependence on Russian fossil fuels would take years to have an impact and, in order for their sunk costs to make financial sense, the projects would need to stay in operation for decades, in defiance of the increasingly desperate warnings we are receiving from the scientific community.\n\nBut of course the push for new fossil projects in North America is not about helping Ukrainians or weakening Putin. The real reason all the old pipe dreams are being dusted off is far more crass: This war has made them vastly more profitable overnight. In the week that Russia invaded Ukraine, the European oil benchmark, Brent crude, reached $105 a barrel, a price not seen since 2014, and it is still hovering above $100 (that's twice what it was at the end of 2020).\n\nBanks and energy companies are desperate to make the most of this price rally, in Texas, Pennsylvania, and Alberta.\n\nAs surely as Putin is determined to reshape Eastern Europe's post-Cold War map, this power play by the fossil fuel sector stands to reshape the energy map. The climate justice movement has won some very important battles over the last decade. It has succeeded in banning fracking in entire countries, states, and provinces; huge pipelines like Keystone XL have been blocked; so have many export terminals and various Arctic drilling forays. Indigenous leadership has played a central role in nearly every fight. And remarkably, as of this week, $40 trillion worth of endowment and pension funds at over 1,500 institutions have committed to some form of fossil fuel divestment, thanks to a decade of dogged divestment organizing.\n\nBut here is a secret our movements often keep even from themselves: Since the price of oil plummeted in 2015, we have been fighting an industry with one hand tied behind its back. That's because the cheaper, easier-to-access oil and gas is mostly depleted in North America, so the pitched battles over new projects have primarily been over unconventional, costlier to extract sources: fossil fuels trapped in shale rock, or under the seabed in the deep ocean, or under Arctic ice, or the semi-solid sludge of the Alberta tar sands. Many of these new fossil fuel frontiers only became profitable after the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003, which sent oil prices soaring. Suddenly, it made economic sense to make those multibillion-dollar investments to extract oil from the deep ocean or to turn Alberta's muddy bitumen into refined oil. The boom years were upon us, with the Financial Times describing the frenzy in tar sands as \"north America's biggest resources boom since the Klondike gold rush.\"\n\nHowever, when the price of oil collapsed in 2015, industry's determination to keep growing at such a frenetic pace wavered. In some cases, investors weren't sure they would earn their money back, which led some majors to pull back from the Arctic and the tar sands. And with profits and stock prices down, divestment organizers were suddenly able to make the case that fossil fuel stocks weren't just immoral, they were a lousy investment, even on capitalism's own terms.\n\nWell, Putin's actions have untied the hand behind Big Oil's back and turned it into a fist.\n\nThis explains the recent wave of attacks on the climate movement and on the handful of Democratic politicians who have advanced science-based climate action. Rep. Tom Reed, a Republican from New York, claimed last week, \"The United States has the energy resources to knock Russia out of the oil and gas market entirely, but we don't use those resources because of President Biden's partisan pandering to the environmental extremists of the Democratic party.\"\n\nThe precise opposite is true. If governments, many of whom ran promising Green New Deal-like policies over the past decade and half, had actually implemented them, Putin would not be able to flout international law and opinion as he has been doing so flagrantly, secure in the belief that he will still have customers for his increasingly profitable hydrocarbons. The underlying crisis we face is not that North American and Western European countries have failed to build out the fossil fuel infrastructure that would allow it to displace Russian oil and gas; it is that all of us - the U.S., Canada, Germany, Japan - are still consuming obscene and untenable amounts of oil and gas, and indeed of energy, period.\n\nWe know the way out of this crisis: Ramp up the infrastructure for renewables, power homes with wind and solar, electrify our transportation systems. And because all energy sources carry ecological costs, we must also reduce demand for energy overall, through greater efficiency, more mass transit, and less wasteful overconsumption. The climate justice movement has been saying this for decades now. The problem is not that political elites have spent too much time listening to so-called environmental extremists, it's that they have hardly listened to us at all.\n\nNow we find ourselves at a strange moment, when a great deal feels up for grabs. BP announced on Sunday that it will sell off its 20 percent stake in Russian oil giant Rosneft, and others are following its lead. That's potentially good news for Ukraine, since pressure on this most critical sector will certainly get Putin's attention. However, we should also be clear that it is likely only happening because BP is planning to take full advantage of the oil and gas frenzy, unleashed by higher prices, in North America and elsewhere. \"BP remains confident in the flexibility and resilience of its financial frame,\" it reassured market watchers in its press release announcing the Rosneft move.\n\nIt's significant too that BP's news came within hours of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz announcing that his country will build two new import terminals to receive shipments of natural gas, further locking in dependence on fossil fuels in the middle of a climate emergency. The terminals had long been opposed by German environmentalists, yet now they are being pushed through under cover of war, presented as the only way of making up for the gas that Scholz had recently announced would not flow through Nord Stream 2, the newly built pipeline running under the Baltic Sea. That move turned a state-of-the-art piece of fossil fuel infrastructure into an \" $11-billion hole in the ground ,\" in the words of The Globe and Mail's European bureau chief, Eric Reguly.\n\nYet it's not only fossil fuel projects that are being killed and revived. \"We are doubling down on renewables,\" Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, announced ahead of Russia's invasion. \"This will increase Europe's strategic independence on energy.\"\n\nThe Sinclair Wyoming Refining Co. oil refinery in Sinclair, Wyo., on Feb. 24, 2022.\n\nWatching these geopolitical chess pieces fly across the board in a matter of days, along with the latest wave of dramatic sanctions against Russian banks and air travel, there are plenty of reasons for dread, including a repeat of measures that punish the poor for the crimes of the rich. But there are flashes of optimism too. What is heartening is less the substance of any individual move than their sheer speed and decisiveness. As in the early months of the pandemic , the response to Russia's invasion should remind us that despite the complexity of our financial and energy systems, it turns out that they can still be transformed by the decisions of mere mortals.\n\nIt's worth pausing over some of the implications. If Germany can abandon an $11 billion pipeline because it's suddenly seen as immoral (it always was), then all fossil fuel infrastructure that violates our right to a stable climate should also be up for debate. If BP can walk away from a 20 percent stake in a Russian oil major, what investment cannot be abandoned if it is premised on the destruction of a habitable planet? And if public money can be announced to build gas terminals in the blink of an eye, then it's not too late to fight for far more solar and wind.\n\nAs Bill McKibben wrote in his excellent newsletter last week, Biden could help in this transformation, using powers only available during times of emergency, by invoking the Defense Production Act to build large numbers of electric heat pumps and shipping them to Europe to mitigate the pain of losing Russian gas. That is the creative spirit we need in this moment. Because if we are building new energy infrastructure - and we must - surely it should be the infrastructure of the future, not more toxic nostalgia.\n\nThere are many lessons we must take from the trembling moment we are living through. About the dangers of allowing nuclear weapons to proliferate unchecked . About the short-sightedness of shaming once great powers. About the grotesque double standards in Western media about which lands, and which lives, are treated as invadable and disposable. About which forced migrations are treated as crises for the people moving, and which are treated as crises for the countries they are moving to. About the willingness of everyday people to fight for lands - and about whose fights for self-determination and territorial integrity are celebrated as heroic, and whose are cast as terrorist. All of these are lessons we must learn from living through this moment of naked history.\n\nAnd we must learn this one as well: It is still possible for humans to change the world we have built when life is on the line, and to do it quickly and dramatically. As we were two years ago when the pandemic was first declared, we are in yet another terrifying but highly malleable moment.\n\nWar is reshaping our world, but so too is the climate emergency. The question is: Will we harness wartime levels of urgency and action to catalyze climate action, making us all safer for decades to come, or will we allow war to add more fuel to a planet already on fire? That challenge was put most sharply recently by Svitlana Krakovska, a Ukrainian scientist who is part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change working group that produced this week's report. Even as her country was under the Kremlin's attack, she reportedly told her scientific colleagues in a virtual meeting that \"Human-induced climate change and the war on Ukraine have the same roots, fossil fuels, and our dependence on them.\"\n\nRussia's outrages in Ukraine should remind us that the corrupting influence of oil and gas lies at the root of virtually every force that is destabilizing our planet. Putin's smug swagger? Brought to you by oil, gas, and nukes. The trucks that occupied Ottawa for a month, harassing residents and filling the air with fumes and inspiring copycat convoys around the word? One of the occupation's leaders showed up in court a few days ago wearing an \"I ♥ Oil and Gas\" sweatshirt. She knows who her sponsors are . Covid-denialism and surging conspiracy culture? Hey, once you have denied climate breakdown, denying pandemics, elections, or pretty much any form of objective reality is a light lift.\n\nAt this late stage in the debate, much of this is well understood. The climate justice movement has won all the arguments for transformational action. What we risk losing, in the fog of war, is our nerve. Because nothing changes the subject like extreme violence, even violence that is being actively subsidized by the soaring price of oil. To prevent that from happening, we could do far worse than to take inspiration from Krakovska, who apparently told her colleagues at the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in that closed-door meeting, \"We will not surrender in Ukraine. And we hope the world will not surrender in building a climate-resilient future.\" Her words so moved her Russian counterpart, eye witnesses reported, that he broke ranks and apologized for the actions of his government - a brief glimpse of a world looking forward, not back.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have?

It turns out that, contrary to Donald Trump's warnings, terrorists weren't coming from Mexico or Syria; they were here in America, and some of them attended his rallies. Trump, of all people, shouldn't be shocked and stunned by the rise of white nationalism and antisemitism in America: he has repeatedly retweeted white supremacist Twitter accounts, accepted campaign donations from white nationalist leaders, picked a white nationalist favorite - Steve Bannon - as his campaign chair and then White House chief strategist, and was officially endorsed by the Ku Klux Klan and was at first reluctant to disavow them. He also tried to rename a U.S. government program designed to counter all violent ideologies so that it focused solely on Islamist and not white nationalist extremism and praised neo Nazis in Charlottesville as \"very fine people.\" On this special episode of Deconstructed, Mehdi Hasan is joined by former Department of Homeland Security senior domestic terrorism analyst Daryl Johnson and Christian Picciolini, a former neo Nazi who left the movement and devoted his life to peace advocacy and deradicalization, to discuss America's descent into far right terror.\n\nChristian Picciolini: When Trump said he was a nationalist, I think that that was the biggest boon for recruitment for white supremacy that we've seen since the film \"The Birth of a Nation\" came out in the early 1900s and caused four million people to join the Klan.\n\n[music interlude]\n\nMehdi Hasan: I'm Mehdi Hasan.

Some of them even attended his rallies. White nationalists, neo-Nazis, domestic terrorists. Call them what you want - personally, I think we should call them the real base of the Donald Trump movement.\n\nAnd on today's show I want to get to the bottom of what's behind this part of his movement, this explosion of white nationalist violence with my guests, former Department of Homeland Security senior domestic terrorism analyst Daryl Johnson who tried to warn us all about the threat posed by white nationalists almost a decade ago, and Christian Picciolini, a former neo-Nazi who left the movement and has devoted his life to peace advocacy and de-radicalization.\n\nDaryl Johnson: This administration has the opportunity to finally kind of quell this heightened state of activity on the part of these white nationalists, and rather than doing that, he's pouring fuel on the fire.\n\nMH: So today on Deconstructed: Is Donald Trump inciting far-right terrorism in the United States?\n\n[music interlude]\n\nMH: There have been some deeply insensitive and frankly, insane statements from the president of the United States over the past few days in the wake of this horrific wave of domestic terrorism. On Friday afternoon, he led his followers in a chant of \"Lock him up\" in reference to Jewish billionaire and Democratic donor George Soros just days after Soros had a pipe bomb mailed to him, allegedly, by a Trump supporter.\n\nDonald Trump: They're called globalists. They like, they like the globe. I like the globe too. I like the globe too but we have to take care of our people. We have to.\n\nCrowd member: Lock him up!\n\nDT: Globalists. (laughs) Lock him up.\n\nMH: On Saturday afternoon, he told his fans that maybe he should have canceled a political event that day. Not because of the massacre at a Jewish synagogue in Pittsburgh that morning, but because he got his hair wet in the rain while commenting on that massacre.\n\nDT: I said, \"maybe I should cancel this arrangement because I have a bad hair day\". And the bad news, somebody said \"Actually it looks better than it usually does.\"\n\nMH: Hilarious, but for me one ludicrous statement stood out in particular above all the others.\n\nDT: Our nation and the world are shocked and stunned by the grief. This was an anti-Semitic act. You wouldn't think this would be possible in this day and age.\n\nMH: Sorry, what? Of all the people who shouldn't be shocked and stunned by this, who shouldn't have assumed it was impossible, is the president of the United States who has done more than any other person to make such attacks possible. And I'm not just talking about his refusal to bring in any kind of gun control measures over the past two years but also his connections to, his ties to the white nationalist hate movement itself.\n\nThis is a president who has repeatedly retweeted white supremacist Twitter accounts; who appointed a white nationalist to be one of his delegates in California; who accepted campaign donations from white nationalist leaders, picked a white nationalist favorite, Steve Bannon, as his campaign chair and then White House chief strategist; who ran anti-Semitic campaign ads; who was officially endorsed by the Ku Klux Klan and was at first reluctant to disavow them; who tried to rename a U.S. government program designed to counter all violent ideologies so that it focused solely on Islamist and not white nationalist extremism; who praised neo-Nazis in Charlottesville as \"very fine people;\" whose chief economic adviser recently hosted a white nationalist at his birthday party; and who as recently as last week was pushing a theory about devious globalists, aka Jews, paying people to bring immigrants and terrorists into the U.S. from Mexico and the Middle East in order to change America. A racist, anti-Semitic conspiracy theory that was embraced in full, I might add, by the alleged killer of those 11 Jewish worshippers in Pittsburgh on Saturday.\n\nAnd look, to be shocked and stunned by anti-Semitism or by far-right violence of any kind is absurd given hate crimes against Jews and against Muslims were at record highs even before these latest attacks. Given also what happened in Charlottesville. Some of in fact us have been warning about the threat posed by white nationalists for a while now.\n\nIn May 2017, I wrote a piece for The Intercept headlined \"The Numbers Don't Lie: White Far-Right Terrorists Pose a Clear Danger to Us All.\" A piece in which I wrote quote: \"Today, the terror threat from far-right white supremacists is the terror threat that dare not speak its name.\" And I got pushback for that, I was accused of trying to downplay the terror threat from Muslims, of trying to deflect attention away from ISIS and onto domestic white terrorists.\n\nPeople didn't want to listen. And they didn't want to listen either back in 2009, almost a decade ago, when Daryl Johnson, then the senior domestic extremism analyst for the Department of Homeland Security was warning about the threat from a resurgent right-wing extremism. Republicans lost their minds, conservative media attacked him and the Obama administration abandoned him. Daryl joins me now here in the studio, as does Christian Picciolini, a former neo-Nazi, author of the recent memoir \"White American Youth: My Descent into America's Most Violent Hate Movement-and How I Got Out\" and he's also the founder of the global intervention network Free Radicals, which tries to get other neo-Nazis out of that movement.\n\nDaryl, Christian, thank you both for joining me on this special episode of Deconstructed. I want to try and answer two main questions in the time we have today. Number one: What role in your view has Donald Trump, his election, his presidency, played in inciting or inspiring domestic terrorism from the far-right? And number two: How do we put the violent genie of white nationalism and far-right extremism back in the bottle, or is it too late?\n\nBut before we get to that let me start by asking you both: What was your reaction when you heard the tragic news on Saturday about the massacre in Pittsburgh? Daryl?\n\nDJ: I mean, it's a terrible, horrific tragedy. Unfortunately, we've had too many of these events over the past 10 years, so it didn't surprise me one bit.\n\nMH: Christian?\n\nCP: Mehdi, I would say the same as Daryl. You know, unfortunately, over the last 20 years, this is something that I've been talking about quite a bit as the rise of you know, far-right extremism. And in fact, since 9/11 more Americans have been killed on U.S. soil by white supremacists and the far-right than by any other foreign or domestic terrorist group combined.\n\nThis is a problem. It's not something that's new to our country. It's something that has been part of our fabric since the beginning; and unfortunately, now, with the power in the administration saying some of the same policy points as these white supremacists believe they feel very emboldened and that's a word we hear quite a bit.\n\nMH: And Christian when you hear the president of the United States saying on Saturday after the Pittsburgh attack \"You wouldn't think this would be possible in this day and age,\" that's either ignorance or dishonesty.\n\nCP: Yeah, you know, maybe a little bit of both. Certainly, it's you know, since America's founding millions of people of color have been killed in the name of white supremacy and even today in our systemic and institutional racism. It exists, you know. When you ask most people-most people of color-about racism, they'll actually talk to you more about systemic racism. And when you talk to white people about racism, it's more about interpersonal racism. And I think you know the idea that white extremists can't be terrorists, or aren't labeled as such, is something that I think that is affecting our society and we don't hold, it doesn't hold the same level of fear and hatred towards the terrorists that are committing these acts when that person has black or brown skin.\n\nMH: Daryl, Christian mentioned how more Americans have been killed on U.S. soil by domestic groups than by \"foreign jihadists.\" There was a study out in September that showed almost two-thirds of the terror attacks in the U.S. last year in 2017 were carried out by right wing extremists. You worked in government, in the Department of Homeland Security - is this a point that is acknowledged by experts in the field within government? Forget the politicians, forget the Republicans in Congress or the president. People, analysts in government, do they acknowledge? Is this accepted?\n\nDJ: Across the board, really not because a lot of the analysts who have focused on international terrorism are totally in the dark when it comes to domestic non-Islamic terrorism. So, I think there's a lot of ignorance out there, misunderstandings, you know. It doesn't help when you have government leaders and administrations that are putting forth the notion that the only form of terrorism are from those with brown skin with funny sounding names who dress differently.\n\nSo, it needs to be acknowledged. It needs to be called out. And one of the things I've been trying to educate the public about is these acts that we often dismiss as you know hate crime, or the act of a crazed gunman, are in fact, ideologically motivated and meet the definition of terrorism.\n\nMH: And they get not called terrorism by the media. And we'll come back to that in a moment. Just on being ignored in government and you know not taken seriously-you of course, produced this report in 2009 for the DHS warning of a resurgent right-wing extremism after the election of the first black president, after a financial crash. Last year, you wrote a piece for the Washington Post saying \"I warned of right-wing violence in 2009, Republicans objected. I was right.\"\n\nTell us what happened in 2009. What did the Republicans do? What did the Obama administration do? Because we hear so much criticism of the Trump administration when it comes to tackling far-right extremism. What did the Obama administration do with your report and with your unit?\n\nDJ: Well, unfortunately, it was a young administration. Janet Napolitano had just been sworn in as Secretary of Homeland Security. The report was published in the very beginning of April of 2008 or 2009. So, she had only been in her position for three months. The Public Affairs Office was just getting up and running with its political appointees.\n\nSo, I think the media backlash from Fox News and then the Congressional backlash from the Republicans really caught the administration off guard. And initially, they tried to defend it but then as the outcry from you know, the conservatives and Republicans grew, they pretty much backed away from it and decided to just cave in to the political pressure.\n\nMH: And within the space of a year according to your Washington Post piece, \"there were no intelligent analysts at DHS working on domestic terrorism threats.\" That's astonishing.\n\nDJ: Yeah, basically we were put under pressure. First, we were reassigned to do other analytical duties. They kind of told us in the interim, this is just going to be a short-term temporary assignment but then as the months drew on and we started seeing the handwriting on the wall that they were not going to reconstitute the effort.\n\nMH: There's a horrible way to be vindicated, isn't it? You're not happy about being proved right. You warn people years ago, even before Trump, and people don't listen to you.\n\nDJ: Yeah, it's very sobering. It's also very frustrating because you know, as an intelligence professional I was trained, you know, to do my job; and I did it to the best of my ability and pretty much because of the political firestorm that ensued the message got lost.\n\nMH: So, conservatives were not happy in 2009, 2010 with what you were saying. Donald Trump becomes president and you have a conservative president and a Republican party that's even more bent on focusing on \"Islamist jihadist threat\" and not focusing on domestic extremist threats.\n\nChristian, your organization at the time \"Life After Hate,\" which you co-founded, which helped neo-Nazis get out of the movement as you did, and we'll come to your story in a moment, but your organization had its funding cut as soon as Donald Trump became president, didn't it?\n\nCP: Yeah, we applied for a grant under the Obama administration. That was part of a DHS Grant and we had won it. We were going to develop an online intervention program to essentially intervene in situations just like the situation in Pittsburgh prior to those events happening. So much radicalization is happening online. And then the administration changed.\n\nWe were patiently waiting for a $400,000 check. And out of the 31 groups that were promised this grant, it came back under Trump's administration that they reassessed the rules and out of the 31 groups, we were the only organization that was rescinded its funding. And interestingly enough, we were the only organization that was completely focused on thwarting white supremacist recruitment.\n\nMH: Wow, so this is not accidental stuff. This is willful. This is intentional. Let me ask you this, as someone who has moved out of the neo-Nazi far-right movement, how important is it to have organizations like \"Free Radicals,\" like \"Life After Hate\" with funding from the government or anyone else providing some support to people who want to leave that movement, who want to leave a life of hate behind?\n\nCP: I think it's critical. We have social services for other parts of our society that are struggling, that may be marginalized. And just like the thousands of foreign fighters who will be coming back from places like Syria in the future, you know, we're facing a situation where we have potentially, you know, hundreds of, thousands of young people who are now part of this white nationalist or alt-right movement who are going to need to find a way, to find support, to leave those types of movements in the future.\n\nYou know, it was very difficult for me to leave the white supremacist movement when I was 23 years old and in '95 because, not because of the ideology. I had questioned the ideology for the eight years that I was involved. What was difficult was leaving that sense of identity, community, and purpose behind. It was all that I had known in my life. And that was the biggest roadblock for me actually disengaging.\n\nMH: And Christian, when you look at someone like Robert Bowers, the alleged shooter in Pittsburgh who has a long history of kind of neo-Nazi like and anti-Semitic and conspiratorial and hateful statements on social media, do you look at him and say wow that's someone potentially, we could have helped?\n\nCP: Absolutely, you know, in fact, most of the people that I work with; and I've worked with you know hundreds to help them disengage, you know, Bowers' story is very typical of the people that I work with: radicalized through online propaganda and conspiracy theories, you know, marginalized through most of their youth, found a sense of identity and community in this movement, and because perhaps they may have known nothing else in their lives and they may have felt powerless, this brings them that power that they need, and when they decide to take it to the next level, and become a lone wolf or to act in the name of their ideology. There are lots of people like that out there.\n\nYou know, at one point in my life, being a fairly well-adjusted kid, there were moments where I was stockpiling weapons and preparing for a race war and encouraging other people to do so. You know, and there are people who gravitate to these movements because part of what the recruiters do is they're looking for vulnerable people that they can get swoop in and promise paradise to, essentially. And that's a common theme not just with white supremacist, but in all types of extremist movements. It's about painting the other as you know, subhuman and evil and that must be eliminated.\n\nMH: So, when we talk about painting the other as evil, let's cut to the chase. What role does the Commander in Chief, the President of the United States Donald Trump play in all of this? This morning Monday morning, he tweeted that, he tweeted \"Another attack on 'the fake news media.' The true enemy of the people\" he called them. He also tweeted about an invasion from this caravan from Honduras and invasion of gang members and very bad people.\n\nThis is what he tweeted after the worst attack on Jews in American history, allegedly by a guy who believed that this caravan was coming to invade us with terrorists and other people who were going to change America. How is that not incitement Daryl Johnson?\n\nDJ: It is incitement and I've been talking about this at least for the past three or four years, about the tone of the rhetoric. Blaming the victims, in this case, by saying \"Well, if you would have had an armed guard in your synagogue, you could have prevented this attack from happening.\"\n\nThat's the wrong answer. He needs to be condemning the ideologies that create these fertile grounds for people to scapegoat and to target other people and to mobilize the violence. He needs to denounce the conspiracy theories rather than perpetuate them. He needs to change his language. Using words such as nationalism, referring to himself as a nationalist.\n\nMH: But he's just proved today, he's not going to do any of that.\n\nDJ: Right, talking about globalism-\n\nMH: If we thought he was going to do any of that after a massacre, he's made it clear Sunday, Monday. He's not going to do that.\n\nDJ: Right and so, what he's doing is these are coded words that are being interpreted by extremists as a green light to go and do their violence against these targets. So, you got to be very careful with the words that you choose and how you're framing it.\n\nI've been extremely disappointed. I think you know, this administration has the opportunity to finally kind of quell this heightened state of activity on the part of these white nationalists and rather than doing that, he's pouring fuel on the fire and causing it to ignite higher.\n\nMH: Daryl, what would you say to a defender of Donald Trump who says \"Hold on, he didn't invent this stuff. This has been around for a while. You yourself were writing a report under Obama in 2009. How can you blame Donald Trump for something that precedes Donald Trump?\" What would you say to them?\n\nDJ: I would say that yes, this vile ideology has existed for decades, but you're main-streaming it. You know, 20 years ago, when I started my analytical career, in order to find out about these conspiracy theories and to find out about white nationalism, you actually had to know somebody. You had to go somewhere. Now-\n\nMH: It's in your face. It's on Fox News, Fox and Friends.\n\nDJ: Right, it's being spoon-fed to you on the internet and the anonymity of your own home.\n\nMH: Christian, you were a neo-Nazi back during the Reagan years, the George Bush Sr. years, the Bill Clinton years. How would you and your then far-right comrades have reacted had Reagan or Bush or Clinton started saying the kind of stuff that Trump has been saying about immigrants and terrorists and globalists and very fine people on both sides?\n\nCP: Well, we would have reacted as though we had permission to be violent, to be vocal about our beliefs. And you know, what it really comes down to is extremist movements feast on our brokenness and fear. Those are the two elements and the primary sources of sustenance for them to thrive. And in fact, their ability rests on you know, their ability to keep those conditions of brokenness and fear going.\n\nSo, not only are they, you know, feeding us with the fuel that we need to be extreme, but they're also creating the conditions that keep us there, and that is the scariest thing to me. Donald Trump is following the playbook of you know, white supremacists in the sense that he's not coming out and saying he's a white supremacist. He's using, you know, dog whistles and policy to reinforce what they believe without, you know, claiming that he is one. So, you know, we're in this time now where we need to decide what America is in the future.\n\nMH: Although in some ways Christian, he's gone beyond dog whistles now. It's more like a foghorn. I mean when he says \"I'm a nationalist. People say you shouldn't say it, but you can call me a nationalist.\" He knows exactly what he's doing. Daryl, you said in your Washington Post piece last year \"Extremists no longer hide anymore,\" referring to this kind of mainstreaming of extremism. In a sense, does that make it easier then if there was a future government or administration that wants to tackle these people? That they're now out in the open-if there was a strategy, if we had a different president who gave a damn about this stuff, would it be easier in a sense to kind of crack down on them, if I can use that phrase?\n\nDJ: I don't think that would be a very easy task. I mean, even if Donald Trump were to stop all of the heated rhetoric and you know the dog whistles and the policies that he's putting forth that's basically playing into these extremists' hands, it's going to take you know months, if not years, for it to deescalate in the population and in these extremist movements.\n\nThat was one of the fears of the Obama administration, I believe, was the fact that they didn't want to crack down on these groups because it would just feed into their greatest fears and paranoia and push more people to violence and radicalization.\n\nMH: Christian, is it too late to put the genie back in the bottle? Is there a way of winning this battle against domestic far-right terrorism, against the ideology that's behind an ideology you once succumbed to, given that for 17 odd years now we've miserably failed to win the battle against \"Islamist or jihadist terrorism?\"\n\nCP: You know, I believe so. I'm hopeful. You know, I've seen more people activated to try and do good today more than I ever have in my life. You know, it really comes down to changing the way our society is. There's certain things that we haven't acknowledged as an American society. We haven't acknowledged that the Holocaust that happened on our own soil 250 years ago where millions of people were killed. We're teaching history different depending on our geography in the United States.\n\nIn the North and I speak to a lot of high school students in the North, you know, we learn about slavery, the Civil War being about slavery, whereas in the South many times when I ask, it's about states' rights or Northern aggression. You know-\n\nMH: You say you're hopeful, Christian. You say you're hopeful. Let me put it this way: are things going to get worse before they get better? That's what it feels like to me with this president.\n\nCP: Yeah, I do think that they're going to get worse before they get better. And I think that the government does have an important role. You know, we're engaged in a code war now. It's not a cold war anymore. We're fighting online propaganda, and conspiracy theories, and foreign actors who are trying to propagate this information so that our own people are fighting against each other. And I think that, you know, cutting off the source at least, from a foreign perspective of all this information coming in, this fake news and propaganda, I think would have a massive impact.\n\nMH: Daryl, do you think Trump and the Republicans and the conservative pundits and Fox News and Breitbart and even parts of the liberal media which have failed so miserably to cover this story properly, failed to use the terrorist word in relation to white guys at home - Do you think they realize exactly what kind of fire they're playing with? What they've been encouraging wittingly or unwittingly in recent years?\n\nDJ: I believe they do. Based on my understanding of, you know, Republican fundraising efforts in the past, especially for the 2008 presidential election. They use a deliberate tactic of dehumanizing Barack Obama. You know, characterizing him as a Muslim, characterizing him as a foreigner, characterizing him as a citizen of another country.\n\nThis was a deliberate strategy. As part of the Republican fundraising efforts leading up to the 2008 election. And so, I think even in past elections, they try to generate fear, paranoia in the hopes of getting those conservative Democrats to swing the vote over into their favor so that they can get leadership into key positions.\n\nCP: And I think it even goes further than that. I think it's you know, policy. It's redlining. It's you know, gerrymandering and things like that that are part of a systemic problem that keep people from voting, is part of the issue as well to maintain power.\n\nMH: Christian, you're an expert on far-right groups. You were in a far-right group. When you look at the modern Republican party-I mean, I'm a British immigrant living in the U.S. I come from an outside perspective. Other conservative parties in the West are not like this one. When you look at the Republican party now as a former member of a far-right group is it fair to call it a far-right party now?\n\nCP: I would say it's very accurate today. At least outwardly and visibly speaking, it's a much more far-right political party than it ever was.\n\nMH: And Daryl just before we finish, just a point you made in your Washington Post piece last year about the difference between the types of terrorism that United States faces right now. One thing I always find interesting is people say \"Well, you can't compare the domestic threat to the 'Islamist threat.' They've brought down the Twin Towers. They've killed far more people.\" But for me, and correct me if I'm wrong, it's much more insidious to have a domestic far-right threat, which has a domestic constituency, which has the support of politicians, prominent members of the media, cable news hosts, which has people willing to justify it, rationalize it in the way we never would about Al-Qaeda or ISIS in the mainstream. Is that fair?\n\nDJ: I think so and plus you have a threat, although it's lower in scale when it comes to the actual violence and the number of people killed, it's persistent. It's happening, you know every month.\n\nMH: There's more of these attacks.\n\nDJ: Yes, and so over time, you know, the damage done and the number of fatalities, you know, is scary. Do we spend all of our resources to protect against an attack that may happen once every 25 years? Or should we have a balanced approach to our threat assessment and combat what's the greatest threat, what's happening most frequently, but also be on guard against that mass-casualty producing attack?\n\nI think a more balanced approach with resources and at the federal level would do much better service than to just focus so much resources and money at an overseas threat that happens, you know once every quarter century.\n\nMH: Christian when you hear the president making these remarks, when you see the stuff that's being trafficked online, how much of this plays into \"radicalization?\" How much is this what attracted people like yourself to the movement in the 80s? When you look at the-you know, a lot of us looking at these guys and wondering, how can there be such hateful people in our midst?\n\nCP: You know, I think that there are people who were already radical but I think for the folks who were on the edge so much of what Trump says is pushing them over that edge. It's solidifying in them what maybe they thought, what they were afraid to say out loud, but now that they feel that there's some agency behind those ideas, you know, they're grasping them. You know, uncles are fighting with, you know, nieces and nephews at family gatherings.\n\nI mean, it's really, it's seeped into every aspect of our society. So, I suspect that and I know, you know, the words that are being said are emboldening people. When Trump said he was a nationalist, I think that that was the biggest boon for recruitment for white supremacy that we've seen since maybe the film \"The Birth of a Nation\" came out and, you know the early 1900s and caused four million people to join the Klan.\n\nI think that it's become so normalized to people who are susceptible to this message that they're grasping at and are becoming far more extreme.\n\nMH: Christian, Daryl, thank you both for joining me on Deconstructed.\n\nCP: Thank you.\n\nDJ: Thank you.\n\n[music interlude]\n\nMH: That was Daryl Johnson, ex-Department of Homeland Security, and Christian Picciolini, ex-neo-Nazi. A fascinating if depressing discussion. You heard Christian say it: things are going to get worse before they get better. Why? Because the president of the United States is busy inciting far-right groups rather than stopping them. And the entire Republican Party, which is more of a white nationalist party these days, than a conventional conservative party, is complicit. Donald Trump didn't invent white nationalism in America but he's given it the biggest boost in living memory, and that too from the bully pulpit of the Oval Office. If that doesn't get you to the polls next week, I don't know what will.\n\nThat's our show. Deconstructed is a production of First Look Media and The Intercept and is distributed by Panoply.

      "text": "Trump's State of the Union Address Reveals His Growing Anxiety Over Encroaching Left-Wing Populism\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nWithout being able to point to policies that have materially improved lives, Trump is forced to argue that his paltry efforts have made America great.\n\nPresident Donald Trump arrives before delivering the State of the Union address at the U.S. Capitol Building on Feb. 5, 2019 in Washington, D.C.\n\nLast night's State of the Union address and rebuttals were a fight over what constitutes \"real America.\" They weren't a rehash of the debate about whether American authenticity is clustered at the coasts or spread out over the heartland. Rather, it was a contest for which politician, party, or movement has the most accurate assessment of what it feels like to be American today.\n\nThis is Trump's home turf, or it used to be. Since he launched his presidential bid in June 2015, he's painted a picture of an America in disarray. \"Our country is in terrible trouble,\" he said back then. \"We don't have victories anymore.\" He evoked Mexicans invading and Chinese people stealing jobs. \"When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo? It doesn't exist, folks. They beat us all the time,\" he said.\n\nThe media at the time hashed and rehashed Trump's remarks, fact checking lies and condemning his racism, laughing all the way . Trump's candidacy was a joke, they said - a clumsy Charybdis of falsehoods and xenophobia that would swallow itself before it caused too much trouble. But of course, those predictions were wrong.\n\nWhat most missed then, but which should be obvious now, is that between his bigoted bromides, Trump was painting a picture of an America that felt more familiar to millions of viewers than anything they'd been served for years.\n\nHe acknowledged that although unemployment numbers were low and declining, the \"real unemployment\" numbers were higher - \"anywhere from 18 to 20 percent.\"\n\n\"Don't believe the 5.6,\" he warned during that first Trump Tower address. \"Don't believe it.\"\n\n\"A lot of people up there can't get jobs,\" he said. Health care costs were going up. We spent relatively more on education, with fewer returns. Deductibles were \"going through the roof.\" Obamacare needed to be replaced with something \"much better for everybody.\" The infrastructure, airports, roads, \"everything\" was like \"a third world country.\" And the thing is, he wasn't all wrong.\n\nHe struck his darkest note on his first day in office, during his inaugural address:\n\nMothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of knowledge; and the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.\n\nTrump was successful in large part because he is impressively adept at diagnosing America's problems. \"Make America Great Again\" is not only a regressive slogan that recalls more prejudiced and unequal historical periods fondly; it's also an acknowledgement that America, as it is, needs improvement. Or as Barack Obama put it, it could be \" more perfect .\" In 2016, the Democratic Party at times lost sight of the fact that making America great was a goal shared by both parties. Instead, it defaulted into \" America is already great , \" offering a platitude which couldn't compete with the reality of unpaid bills and soaring health care costs.\n\nIncreasingly, however, Trump is in a political pickle - one that flows from a promise made during that inaugural address: \" This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.\" Trump's brand is diagnosing America's ills, but as he ages into his incumbency, those ills increasingly manifest on his watch, and he's forced to lean more heavily on new manufactured crises that can't be attributed to his leadership.\n\nAs in his January Oval Office address, Trump's State of the Union remarks were full of inaccurate fearmongering about the border . He criticized the high cost of health care and, in a somewhat unexpected turn, the scourge of childhood cancers and HIV.\n\nBut now it is Trump who must defend his record. It's Trump who feels pressured to make the case that America is already great.\n\nIn the first portion of his remarks, he did exactly that. He celebrated combat veterans from WWII (when America presumably was great) and then lauded American astronauts who are \"once again\" going into space, drawing a rhetorical line between these achievements. He bragged about an \"unprecedented economic boom\" - a boom that started before his presidency and continues despite it - and held up low unemployment numbers as evidence of his leadership prowess.\n\nThe Trump who advised Americans to consider \"real unemployment\" numbers is long gone. In his place stands a man so eager to defend his record that he reported employment statistics, his best Trump card, four different ways so as to magnify the impression of his success: \"5.3 million new jobs\"; \"600,000 new manufacturing jobs\"; blue-collar jobs, growing faster than anyone else thought possible; more people working than at any time during American history. Jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs.\n\nTrump's focus on jobs numbers is understandable given how little else he has to brag about: Cutting more regulations in two years than any other administration had done in four; a transparent greed-driven tax cut for millionaires and billionaires that's growing more difficult to spin as tax season approaches and Americans start to see the consequences on their returns; America becoming the world's No. 1 oil producer at a time when scientific consensus says that oil dependence is a death sentence. The accomplishments enumerated during last night's address were underwhelming at best.\n\nBut what's important to note here is that Trump is facing is the impotence of incumbency. Without being able to point to policies that have materially improved people's lives, he's forced to argue that his paltry efforts have made America great. And given the state of the nation, that's no enviable position to be in.\n\nIn her reply , former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams was able to capitalize on Trump's new posture. To justify his lack of accomplishment, Trump had to invent a twisted fantasy-scape of marauding Mexican murderers, while tiptoeing around his broken promises with vague references to health care costs that didn't directly implicate his attacks on existing health care infrastructure.\n\nBut Abrams was free to fill the role Trump once played so well, accurately identifying America's problems: Voter suppression; farmers hobbled by a tariff war; factories closing; children caged at the border. Even Fox News pundits had to acknowledge : \"She seemed to get more to what people's lives are like in the reality.\" With a diverse crowd standing behind her and a message that gave voice to a broad range of concerns, Abrams won the fight over what America really looks like.\n\nAbrams deftly ran through the panoply of policy issues ignored by Trump, and offered a warm, compassionate alternative to Trump's drowsy teleprompter recital. Our strength as a country, she argued, is our ability to pull together to advance common goals. \" We may come from different sides of the political aisle, but our joint commitment to the ideals of this nation cannot be negotiable.\" Unfortunately, Abrams argued, Republicans have bargained away their commitment to the ideals shared by most Americans. \"Under the current administration, far too many hard-working Americans are falling behind, living paycheck to paycheck, most without labor unions to protect them from even worse harm. The Republican tax bill rigged the system against working people. Rather than bringing back jobs, plants are closing, layoffs are looming, and wages struggle to keep pace with the actual cost of living.\"\n\nHer message was concise and effective: \"With a renewed commitment to social and economic justice, we will create a stronger America together. Because America wins by fighting for our shared values against all enemies, foreign and domestic. That is who we are, and when we do so, never wavering, the state of our union will always be strong.\"\n\nAnd while centrist hacks (and complicit mainstream media outlets ) attempted to construe Sen. Bernie Sanders's State of the Union response as a racially motivated upstaging, his State of the Union response, which he has given for the past two years, was, in fact, a complement to Abrams's successful rebuttal.\n\nWhereas Abrams had only 10 minutes to respond, a limitation intrinsic to the party's official address, Sanders had the space to articulate, in detail, exactly where Trump went wrong. If winning the game is about accurately diagnosing the country's problems, then Bernie came to play.\n\n\"I want to talk to you about the major crisis facing our country that, regrettably, President Trump chose not to discuss,\" began Sanders. America is great again, he offered, appropriating Trump's thesis before flipping it on its head: At least it is \"for the members of his Mar-a-Lago country club.\"\n\n\"For many of President Trump's billionaire friends, the truth is they have never ever had it so good,\" argued Sanders. \"As Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said, 'This country has socialism for the rich, and rugged individualism for the poor.'\" Today, as then, the economy is great for the rich. Twenty-five hedge fund managers on Wall Street made nearly twice as much as all 140,000 kindergarten teachers in America, explained Sanders. Meanwhile, the \"real wages for the average American worker are lower today then they were in 1972 ... 46 years ago.\" If Trump once wanted Americans to focus on \"real wages,\" Sanders was happy to oblige.\n\nSanders adroitly undermined Trump's claim that his leadership resulted in low unemployment numbers, pointing out that job creation tapered off during Trump's first year. He explained that the average worker received a raise of merely $1.60 a week, while \"the three richest people in America saw their wealth increase by more than $68 billion.\" He argued that Trump was right to want to address infrastructure, but wrong to try to privatize our highways - selling them off to the highest bidder for individual gain at the cost of citizens.\n\nSanders painted a clear picture of the winners and losers of the Trump era. Under this administration, Walmart, Pfizer, and other big corporations have paid out big bonuses to their CEOs while laying off employees - many of whom were already struggling to get by with the support of the social safety net. And the Vermont senator called Trump out for vowing to protect that social safety net as he supported cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security.\n\nSanders pointedly highlighted Trump's hypocrisy about violence committed by undocumented immigrants, explaining that they commit less crime than natural-born Americans. He called out Trump for talking about the murder of Americans by an undocumented man in Nevada while staying silent about the deadliest incident of gun violence to ever happen in America, which also took place in Nevada in 2017. Sanders castigated Trump for failing to mention climate change, and for undermining the security of \"Dreamers.\"\n\nBut in the most powerful part of his address, Sanders didn't merely react to Trump. In an ad lib not captured in the official transcripts , Sanders asked the only question that really matters: \"Why don't you do what the American people want you to do rather than what wealthy campaign contributors want?\"\n\nWhat do the American people want? Sanders ran down the stats:\n\n... And on and on and on.\n\nA $15 minimum wage; free public college; government assistance for child care - what Americans want are progressive policies . So, Sanders asked, \"why isn't Congress and the White House doing what the American people want them to do?\"\n\nThe answer is not complicated, he explained in a familiar but still salient refrain. \"The answer has everything to do with the power of the monied interests.\" Greed is destroying the nation, says Sanders, not Mexicans. The 1 percent is the source of American hardship, not the border.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nIn a separate response for the Working Families Party, Mandela Barnes, Wisconsin's new lieutenant governor and a rising progressive star, hit some of the same notes as Sanders, singling out the wealthy few as a barrier to social justice advocacy. \" We need a movement that sees our fights for economic justice, and racial justice, and climate justice, and for a real and reflective democracy as all bound up together,\" he said . \"Our movement seeks not only to change what is possible, but what is expected. We must commit ourselves to an America that works for the many, not the few.\"\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders looks at his notes as he watches the State of the Union address at the U.S. Capitol Building on Feb. 5, 2019 in Washington, D.C.\n\nThere was perhaps no greater testament to the power of Sanders's reframing than the fact that Trump's remarks seemed to anticipate not the official Democratic Party's response, but rather the rhetoric most famously advanced by Sanders and fellow democratic socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\n\" Here, in the United States,\" said Trump, \"we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country. America was founded on liberty and independence - and not government coercion, domination, and control. We are born free, and we will stay free.\"\n\nBut Sanders, who was spotted scribbling notes during Trump's address, was prepared to respond to this line of attack: \" Trump said, 'We are born free, and we will stay free.' Well, I say to President Trump: People are not truly free when they can't afford to go to the doctor when they are sick. People are not truly free when they cannot afford to buy the prescription drugs they desperately need. People are not truly free when they are unable to retire with dignity. People are not truly free when they are exhausted because they are working longer and longer hours for low wages. People are not truly free when they cannot afford a decent place in which to live. People certainly are not free when they cannot afford to feed their families.\"\n\nBy the end of Sanders's remarks, it was clear why Trump felt the need to call out socialism. Genuine, progressive populism - messaging that put society's and people's interests first - is a threat to Trump's oligarchy-dressed-in-populist-clothing. Ocasio-Cortez agrees.\n\n\"I think that he needs to do it because he feels like - he feels himself losing on the issues,\" Ocasio-Cortez told Rachel Maddow following Trump's remarks. \"Every single policy proposal that we have adopted and presented to the American public has been overwhelmingly popular, even some with a majority of Republican voters supporting what we're talking about.\"\n\n\"I think he sees himself losing on the issues, he sees himself losing on the wall in the southern border, and he needs to grasp at an ad hominem attack, and this is his way of doing it. What we need to realize is happening is this is an issue of authoritarian regime versus democracy. In order for him to try to dissuade or throw people off the scent of the trail, he has to really make and confuse the public. And I think that that's exactly what he's trying to do.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez is right; fear tactics and money only go so far. To paraphrase both Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders: They've got money, but we've got people.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "Donald Trump is Spending More on Hats and Other Merchandise Than on Campaign Staff\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nIs Trump's campaign structured more as a publicity tour than a quest for the White House? With almost $2 million spent in July on merchandise -- but just one worker in Ohio -- it appears that may be the case.\n\nSome GOP operatives and other political observers are starting to suspect that Donald Trump's campaign is structured more as a publicity tour than a quest for the White House.\n\nFederal disclosures released this past weekend help make the case that the real estate mogul, at the very least, is not conducting a traditional campaign operation.\n\nThey show, among other things, that Trump's organization spent more money in July on the now-iconic \"Make America Great Again\" red hats, Trump T-shirts, and mugs than on the staff whose job it is to run the campaign.\n\nThe Trump campaign paid more than $1.8 million to two vendors - California-based headwear-maker Cali-Fame and Louisiana's Ace Specialties - for T-shirts, mugs, stickers, and the red hats (which the campaign spent over $400,000 on alone).\n\nCompare that to his spending on staff. In the month of July, Trump spent roughly $921,000 on staff and consultants, about half of what he spent on merchandise bearing his own name and slogans.\n\nThere's also curiously little spending on field staff - ground troops who work to corral votes. In the crucial swing state of Ohio, the Trump campaign at the tail end of July employed a single field staffer: Andrew Coffield , who lists himself as the Southeastern Ohio Regional Representative for the campaign on his LinkedIn page.\n\nThe local Ohio press reports that Trump opened a modest campaign office in the state in early August, although we'll have to wait until next month's federal disclosures to know if his spending in the state has ramped up in any significant way.\n\nThen there is the fact that a significant amount of Trump's campaign spending is going to his own businesses. One analysis of the latest financial disclosures found that the campaign has spent $7.7 million at Trump's companies, around 9 percent of the campaign's total spending. This includes money that went for Trump's private jets, the Trump Tower, and the Mar-a-Lago golf club in Florida.\n\nThen there's the almost nonexistent presence on the advertising airwaves. The Trump campaign has been outspent 17-to-1 by the Clinton campaign; the Republican nominee has spent just $4 million to date on general election advertising compared with Clinton's $68 million.\n\nBy every measure, Trump has little more than a skeleton of a campaign operation, and what little he does have is unusually tilted toward benefiting his own bottom line and publicity.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "Trump the Outsider Outsources His Budget to Insider Think Tank\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nMany of its proposals are lifted straight from the recommendations of an elite ultra-conservative D.C. think tank: the Heritage Foundation.\n\nPresident Trump's budget proposal, released on Thursday, echoes none of the populist, anti-establishment themes of candidate Trump's campaign for higher office. Instead, it calls for a large increase in defense spending while reducing spending for a variety of popular domestic programs.\n\nThat's not surprising considering where those ideas came from. Rather than bringing in new ideas from outside of the Beltway, many of its proposals are lifted straight from the recommendations of an elite ultra-conservative D.C. think tank: the Heritage Foundation.\n\nFounded in 1973, Heritage has served as a sort of a watering hole for the Republican establishment, providing policy papers and staffers for GOP members of Congress and presidential administrations. Its 2015 annual report listed almost $100 million in revenues - drawn from conservative mega-donors and corporations - which it uses to facilitate the spread of its ideas across Washington, D.C.\n\nAnd those ideas have found a home in the Trump administration, which leaned heavily on Heritage advice during the transition period. Many of the White House proposal's ideas are identical to a budget blueprint Heritage drew up last year.\n\nHere are just a few examples:\n\nHeritage is certainly pleased with the outcome - mostly. It put out a statement on Thursday praising the White House budget proposal.\n\n\"President Trump's budget proposal marks a stark contrast from the reckless spending of the past administration. The proposed cuts to non-defense programs, together with executive actions to streamline federal agencies and cut waste, signal that this administration is serious about cutting the bloated Washington bureaucracy down to size,\" it wrote. \"Congress should work with the administration to bring greater accountability to government.\"\n\nThere was just one part the think tank didn't like - it complained that Trump's call for an additional $54 billion in defense spending just isn't big enough: \"President Trump's 2018 defense budget proposal represents a clear commitment to rebuilding the military and a desire to repeal damaging sequestration defense caps. However, this increase is insufficient to begin the much-needed re-building.\"\n\nTop photo: Copies of President Donald Trump's overview of budget priorities for FY2018, titled \"America First: A Budget Blueprint to Make America Great Again,\" are put on display at the Government Publishing Office (GPO) and the Office of Management and Budget, on March 16, 2017, in Washington.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "The Espionage Axe: Donald Trump and the War Against a Free Press\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nFreedom of the Press Foundation's Trevor Timm, organizer Bill Fletcher Jr., and Dr. Krystal Redman are this week's podcast guests.\n\nAnother alleged whistleblower has been charged with espionage. This week on Intercepted: Donald Trump is set to shatter Barack Obama's record of prosecuting journalistic sources under the 1917 Espionage Act. Trevor Timm, executive director of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, talks about the weaponization of this law for use in stopping investigative journalism and the case of Air Force veteran Daniel Hale, who is facing 50 years in prison. Jeremy Scahill tells the story of the prosecution of Socialist leader Eugene Debs in 1918 and its echoes in the modern era. Organizer Bill Fletcher Jr. discusses the Trump administration's intensifying military threats against Iran, the ongoing coup attempt in Venezuela, and offers strategic thoughts on how to view the 2020 Democratic primary field. The anti-choice movement is making its most intense push to abolish Roe v. Wade in years and with Trump's new Supreme Court justices, the threat could become reality. Dr. Krystal Redman, executive director of SPARK Reproductive Justice Now in Georgia, talks about the spate of new laws being implemented in several states that seek to criminalize abortion and women's health care providers.\n\nQueen: I'm the Invisible Man.\n\n\"The Invisible Man\" (1933): He's invisible. That's what's the matter with him. If he gets the rest of them clothes off, we'll never catch him in a thousand years.\n\nDonald J. Trump: There was nobody that was in the history of our country more transparent than me. There has never been anybody so transparent.\n\n\"The Invisible Man\" (1933): Help! Help! He's here. It's the Invisible Man.\n\nDJT: I was transparent. I was totally transparent. But I've been the most transparent president in history.\n\n\"The Invisible Man\" (1933): He's here. The Invisible Man!\n\nDJT: I can't imagine being more transparent. There has never been a president that's been more transparent than me or the Trump administration. I have been the most transparent president in the history of our country by far.\n\n[Music interlude.]\n\nJeremy Scahill: This is Intercepted.\n\n[Music interlude.]\n\nJS: I'm Jeremy Scahill, coming to you from the offices of The Intercept in New York City. And this is episode 93 of Intercepted.\n\nMark Ruffalo [reading Eugene Debs' speech]: For in every age it has been the tyrant, the oppressor and the exploiter who has wrapped himself in the cloak of patriotism or religion or both to deceive and overawe the people.\n\nJS: On June 16, 1918, the prominent Socialist labor leader Eugene Debs delivered a speech in Canton, Ohio. In the speech, Debs argued against U.S. involvement in World War I and he praised activists who had been organizing against the military draft or had been convicted of sedition. At the time, Debs was one of the most prominent socialists in the United States and his speech came on the heels of the Russian Revolution and the rise of global socialist and communist movements. Eugene Debs had run for president four times as of the day of that speech. Here is actor Mark Ruffalo reading part of that speech.\n\nMR [reading Eugene Debs' speech]: The working class who fight all the battles, the working calls who make the supreme sacrifices, the working class who freely shed their blood and furnish their corpses had never yet had a voice in either declaring war or making peace. It is the ruling class that invariably does both. They alone declare war and they alone make peace. Yours not to reason why. Yours but to do and die. That is their motto.\n\nJS: Soon after that speech, Eugene Debs was arrested and he was charged under a new law in the U.S. that had passed just a year earlier. It was called The Espionage Act. Debs and his lawyers argued that his anti-war speech was protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution. And they lost. And Debs was sentenced to ten years in prison. The case eventually went to the U.S. Supreme Court where the justices voted unanimously to uphold the conviction of Eugene Debs. \"I believe in free speech, in war as well as in peace,\" Debs told the jury during his trial. \"If the Espionage Law stands, then the Constitution of the United States is dead.\"\n\nFrom his prison cell, Debs ran for a 5th time for president of the United States on the Socialist Party ticket. He got nearly a million votes, almost three and a half percent - the most ever won by a Socialist at that time. In 1921, President Warren Harding commuted Eugene Debs sentence, but he did not pardon him. Though he did invite Debs to meet him at the White House.\n\nCongress ultimately amended parts of the Espionage Act, but the thrust of the law has remained in effect to this day. Anarchist Emma Goldman was also prosecuted under the act. Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted under the law.\n\nNewscaster: One of the greatest peace-time spy dramas in the nation's history reaches its climax as Julius Rosenberg and Morton Sobell, convicted of revealing atomic secrets to the Russians, entered a federal building in New York to hear their doom. Another of the spy ring, Mrs. Ethel Rosenberg, who with her husband was convicted of actually transmitting the secrets to Russia through Soviet diplomatic channels.\n\nJS: Throughout its history, the Espionage Act has been used as a weapon to attack free speech and dissent. And then decades later came the Pentagon Papers case where the U.S. government charged the whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg under the Espionage Act. He faced 115 years in prison.\n\nDaniel Ellsberg: How can you measure the jeopardy that I'm in whether it's 10 years, 20 years, 115 years, rather ludicrous amounts like that to the penalty that has been paid already by 50,000 American families here and hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese families. It would be absolutely presumptuous of me to pity myself in that context and I certainly don't and I'd be ashamed of myself.\n\nJS: The charges were all dismissed in 1973, mostly because of rampant misconduct and illegal surveillance by the Nixon administration. But it was this model, developed by Nixon's Justice Department that would be passionately adopted decades later as the weapon of choice of President Barack Obama to wage attacks on journalistic sources and journalism.\n\nBarack Obama: Since I've been in office, my attitude has been zero tolerance for these kinds of leaks and speculation.\n\nJS: Obama's Justice Department indicted eight journalistic sources under the Espionage Act, more than all U.S. presidents before him combined. Among these cases was U.S. Army whistleblower Chelsea Manning, former CIA officer Jeffrey Sterling,  National Security Agency whistleblower Thomas Drake, and NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. In some of these cases, people were sentenced to lengthy prison terms. In others, the government ruined the lives of the targets.\n\nDJT: We're going to find the leakers. We're going to find the leakers. They're going to pay a big price for leaking.\n\nJS: Then Donald Trump takes power and immediately begins using the playbook refined and sharpened by his predecessor, President Obama. Donald Trump is now surpassing Obama's eight year record in just over two years in office. The first case Trump brought was against Reality Winner, who was accused of leaking a top secret document to a news organization. That NSA document related to alleged Russian intelligence operations aimed at breaching software systems used in some U.S. voting systems. Then FBI agent Terry Allbury was indicted for allegedly leaking information about FBI surveillance and informant operations to a news organization.\n\nThe government did not name the news organization in these cases, but other media outlets attributed the reporting to The Intercept. And then, last week, came the arrest of another alleged whistleblower, Daniel Everett Hale. The Justice Department is accusing Hale of leaking documents on the global assassination program and drone programs run by the Obama administration. This indictment also does not name a news organization but Trump administration officials - in leaks to news organizations - have claimed that it's The Intercept.\n\nI want to be clear here: Nothing I say here should be understood as discussing the specifics of the Hale case. And The Intercept does not discuss alleged confidential sources whoever they are. But I do want to state the following: Whoever provided documents for The Intercept's reporting on U.S. assassination operations should be viewed as a hero who did a major public service at immense personal risk. This whistleblower provided the most detailed account ever published of what amounts to a secret legal system wherein the president of the United States and his advisors make lists of people to kill, including U.S. citizens who have not been charged with crimes.\n\nThe documents published by The Intercept showed that at times as many as 9 out of 10 people that the U.S. killed in its so-called targeted assassinations were not the intended target. These documents revealed how the watchlisting system has spiraled out of control and how U.S. citizens have no right to know if or why they are on watch lists or kill lists. This was an extremely important and brave moment in the history of the post-9/11 secrecy and mass killing operations and the fight against them. Back in 2015, I discussed this on Democracy Now!.\n\nJS [on Democracy Now!]: Our source is an incredibly principled brave individual and you know, I worry because the government is, this government has been relentless in its pursuit of people of conscience who blow the whistle and has characterized them as traitors and spies and in the process has criminalized the ability to do independent journalism that is meant to hold them accountable, the government accountable without fear that your sources, or in some cases the journalists themselves are going to be put in the cross hairs of the so-called justice system.\n\nJS: We are at an extremely dangerous moment in the history of this country. Donald Trump is using the same rhetoric used by Nazi officials in the 1930s and 40s to attack the press. He has said that he wants to jail journalists who publish stories he doesn't like. And he is wielding the Espionage Act like a chainsaw against journalistic sources. What makes it all so much worse is that it was the Constitutional law scholar and Trump predecessor Barack Obama who teed Trump up, who laid the groundwork, who blazed the trail for this extremely deranged and dangerous man currently occupying 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nBut look at the way these stories are covered in the broader media. With a few notable exceptions, the lack of solidarity or just basic understanding of how dangerous these cases are is just largely absent. Instead there are attacks on the news organizations or the reporters. And for all of the talk of how dangerous Trump is to a free press, why hasn't the Reality Winner case been covered more extensively? Why is a CNN reporter who lost his credentials a national scandal and threatening alleged whistleblowers with 50 years in prison is a non-story? My colleague James Risen knows a lot about the Espionage Act. When he was a reporter at the New York Times, he fought the Bush and Obama administrations for some 7 odd years when they tried to force Jim to testify against an alleged source of his being prosecuted under the Espionage Act. Last week, Jim Risen discussed how many media organizations are covering these cases when he talked to Amy Goodman on Democracy Now!\n\nJames Risen [on Democracy Now!]: It's as if they're joining in with the Justice Department and the prosecutor in hunting down a bank robber or something. And so I think that's a fundamental flaw in the way the press covers these things is that they look at it as a crime rather than as an attack by the Justice Department on the press in the United States which is what this is.\n\nJS: Daniel Everett Hale is facing a half a century in prison for his alleged crime of blowing the whistle on a secret assassination program that regularly resulted in the killing of civilians, including an American teenager. None of this is about espionage. And it should be clear to every journalist in this country, to every person of conscience that what this prosecution is about is threatening anyone who even thinks of leaking, say, a Trump tax return. This is about criminalizing journalism. It is about increasing the secrecy and decreasing the transparency. It is an assault on the very idea of a democratic society. At these moments, silence is complicity. Everyone should care about what happened to Reality Winner and what's happening again to Chelsea Manning and what has happened to Edward Snowden and, yes, Julian Assange. And we should all care what happens to Daniel Everett Hale.\n\nThis is a precedent setting moment, not just legally, but morally. Because this is not the end. This is the beginning and they will eventually come for other news organizations. Or they will scare news outlets from doing high stakes national security reporting. It doesn't matter what you think of any of these individual whistleblowers. It doesn't matter what you think of The Intercept. But it does matter that we all recognize that this is an attack on our basic rights to information about what the U.S. government does in our names and with our tax dollars. It matters that people who blow the whistle on crimes and war crimes be defended and not abandoned or portrayed as violent criminals or traitors. All of us must ask ourselves where we stand. History will remember our answers.\n\nJS: Joining me now is Trevor Timm. He is the executive director of the Freedom of the Press Foundation. Trevor, welcome to Intercepted.\n\nTrevor Timm: Thanks for having me.\n\nJS: Let's just start, your general thoughts about the latest indictment, the indictment of Daniel Everett Hale.\n\nTT: Well, first of all, this is the seventh prosecution of a source of a journalist in just a little over two years in the Trump administration. The Trump administration right now, is on pace to shatter the Obama administration's records for prosecution of journalists' sources. This is a huge threat to press freedom. Even if journalists themselves aren't getting prosecuted, this creates a massive chilling effect across the government bureaucracy when journalism in many cases has never been more important in holding our government to account. The fact that the Trump administration is targeting sources who have allegedly provided journalists with really important documents and stories that have been cited dozens of times by other news organizations, which have forced both the Obama and Trump administration to be more transparent about issues of foreign policy and national security.\n\nThe American public should be quite disturbed that they are taking it to this level and you can almost guarantee that this is not the last leak investigation or the last leak indictment. The Trump administration has talked about how they have dozens of other cases opened and virtually every major news organization in this country likely has sources that are under investigation now and it's possible that surveillance is being done on both the sources and the journalists. And this has far-reaching implications for press freedom in the United States. And I think it should worry everybody.\n\nJS: The charges against Daniel Hale could bring up to 50 years in prison.\n\nTT: Yeah, the Espionage Act is this Draconian statute from literally World War I. So, it's over a hundred years old. It was originally passed by Congress to go after spies and saboteurs.\n\nNewscaster: The Wilson administration under criticism as soft on pro-Germans, seeks and gets tough new laws suppressing freedom of speech and opinion.\n\nTT: And yet in the past few decades has been morphed and warped into this statute that ends up going after the sources of journalists. It was never used for this purpose in its first 50 or 60 years. In fact, the first Espionage Act case was Pentagon Papers whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg who faced over 100 years in jail.\n\nReporter: The latest indictment says, 115-year prison term and a $120,000 fine, the maximum. Are your thoughts still the same that you're willing to accept any consequences?\n\nDE: I have two thoughts about that. I go back to my earlier answer. How can you measure the jeopardy that I'm in whether it's 10 years, 20 years, 115 years, rather ludicrous -\n\nTT: But it's really just been in the past decade or so, which it started with the Bush administration then expanded to the Obama administration and now is really being used as a regular weapon by the Trump administration to go after whistleblowers who come forward to the press. The real disturbing aspect of this law is that it virtually offers no defenses to the alleged sources who are prosecuted.\n\nJS: What do you mean by that?\n\nTT: If you are a source and bring something to a journalist, maybe you think it is showing government corruption or illegality and the U.S. government considers it classified, it may be your only option to go to the press to get some accountability. Yet, when these sources go to trial they're not allowed to talk about the public benefits to these leaks. They're not allowed to argue that actually, this leak did not harm national security at all and it was a huge benefit for the public to know this information. They aren't allowed to talk about their motives for leaking. So you can imagine a whistleblower going to a journalist because they feel the American public wants to know this information. That is far far different than a government official selling information to a foreign adversary for profit yet these things are treated one in the same by the Justice Department. There's a famous story of Daniel Ellsberg when he gets on the stand during the Pentagon papers case, you know him and his lawyer had prepared for months to tell the jury exactly why he came forward with the Pentagon Papers and all the lies he had been seeing from the Nixon and Johnson administration.\n\nDE: Nixon is trying to throw the book at us. He continues to lie. The three areas in which he's lying today, this very day: Number one, he says the war is winding down. He says he hasn't bombed the dikes. That's a blatant lie. The Vietnamese dikes have been bombed.\n\nTT: And his lawyer asked why did you do this? The prosecution objects. The judge quickly sustains the objection and Daniel Ellsberg is sitting there speechless thinking I'm not allowed to tell the jury why I did this and so, this is what has happened with every leak case since. These sources and whistleblowers are not allowed to tell their story to the jury. The only thing that matters is did you have access to information and did you give it to a journalist? And if that's the case, you face decades in jail for some of these charges. And so, it's impossible for these people to get a fair trial. So, what happens is now almost all of these cases in the Trump administration end in plea deals because they basically have their hands tied behind their back. And so this process keeps repeating over and over again where the Trump administration can bring more and more of these cases.\n\nJS: One pattern that I've noticed emerging is that there is virtual silence from many important news organizations on these prosecutions. When Chelsea Manning was put on trial in front of a military court, The New York Times and CNN basically had to be shamed into coming to cover the trial by independent journalists like Alexa O'Brien, Kevin Gosztola, other people who were covering it. And The New York Times was one of the major publishers of Chelsea Manning's leaks through all phases of it: the diplomatic cables, the war logs, etcetera, and they had to sort of be shamed into even covering her trial. And then you have these cases where Reality Winner or Terry Albury or now Daniel Hale and you have this lionization of the Pentagon papers leak now, but those same publications who are happy to engage in the kind of historical celebration of their bravery seem to be completely missing what I think clearly is an absolute assault on journalistic sources and ultimately, journalism.\n\nTT: You're exactly right and it's infuriating and depressing, both the same time. Press freedom, in some cases, this is a good thing, has been in the public eye more than ever in the last two years because Trump is constantly going out there disparaging journalists and talking about how they're the enemy of the people. And while you know taking Trump's tweets and statements all together is a bit alarming this has much more dire consequences for journalists than anything Trump can tweet. He is using the awesome power of the Justice Department to go after journalists sources, to get their communications, in some cases, directly spy on journalists, and it gets barely a mention from a lot of journalists who often claim to care about these issues of press freedom.\n\nJS: It's so transparent and clear that with William Barr as attorney general, the Trump administration has a strategy now that seems aimed at blocking any attempt to leak about this administration. They don't want his tax returns leaked. They want nothing leaked. So, they dig up this case, they dig up from five years ago and clearly the Obama administration had decided not to prosecute it. It's not even that they care so much about what let's say, Daniel Hale did specifically, it does seem to be a weaponization of the Justice Department and these prosecutions aimed at stopping anyone else from leaking because hey, we're going to throw the book at you. You get 50 years in prison if you leak about Trump.\n\nTT: Right, exactly. I mean, you really only have to listen to what Trump says. I mean, you know, everybody is furious when Trump starts tweeting about journalists as enemy of the people. But look what he says around that. He talks about how he is furious with leakers. The FBI and [the] Justice Department have figured out that they can use technology to basically track everything that every government employee does. You know, we talk a lot about surveillance of the American people which is incredibly important, but the government is actually surveilling its own employees much more than anybody else.\n\nAnd when you know, you see these indictments and how they are able to track somebody's every move, what they looked at, what they printed, cameras following them around. It's quite scary, especially when we're dealing with a president as unhinged as Trump. You know, we want journalists talking to these people and journalists are talking to them all the time. So the idea that we should just you know, kind of poo-poo these indictments and use them to kind of take shots at the news organizations or journalists who are involved in them, it's just quite depressing because you know, we're not seeing the forest and the trees here. This is a direct attack on press freedom. We should be up in arms about it.\n\nJS: You read the indictment of Daniel Hale, I assume?\n\nTT: Yes.\n\nJS: Seventeen-page indictment. There have been media organizations that have reported that I am the reporter in question. And that The Intercept is the publication in question. And of course, we're not going to make any comment whatsoever about anything specific regarding this case and it's our general policy to not talk about any confidential or anonymous sources, but based on what the government is alleging in the indictment, what was it exactly that Daniel Hale did or that the government is accusing him of having leaked? What kinds of documents?\n\nTT: So it looks like from the indictment that they are accusing Daniel Hale of leaking to an unnamed news organization and reporter which seems to be The Intercept.\n\nAmy Goodman: In 2015, The Intercept published a special report called The Drone Papers exposing the inner workings of the U.S. military's assassination program in Afghanistan, Yemen and Somalia. The publication's findings were later turned into a book called \"The Assassination Complex: Inside the Government's Secret Drone Warfare Program.\"\n\nTT: And also the investigation into the government's terrorist watch list, which has caused all sorts of controversy over the past 15 or 20 years since 9/11, which has led to dozens of lawsuits where the ACLU in many cases has represented people who have been wrongly put on this list, whether it's the no-fly list or other terrorist watch lists where there is virtually no due process. Everything is kept secret and the people who are affected are kept in the absolute dark. And both of these investigations were incredibly important to understand the vast secretive national security apparatus of the United States and how it is ripping due process rights away from both Americans and people abroad. You know, nobody is arguing that this stuff shouldn't be public and that the government isn't over-classifying information and this isn't information that the American public should have access to.\n\nThese are really important stories. And this is actually, this is what all national security reporters do. They uncover things that the government is doing behind closed doors the American public deserves to know about. I mean, when we think about the classification system virtually everything that the U.S. government does in both the realm of foreign policy and national security, they consider secret. They consider classified and so they can use this Espionage Act as a weapon to wield. Then there's a leak that they don't like, they can go after that source, and then they can feel free to leak information that they so choose that is also considered classified to basically shape the narrative for how people see what the U.S. government is doing. And it's you know, not only just grossly unfair and even un-American to the sources that are affected but it really negatively affects, you know, the hundreds of millions of people in the American public who have no idea what their government is doing.\n\nJS: You know, I also think it's important to remind people how powerful leakers or powerful people who are sloppy with their \"operational security\" are treated. I'm thinking specifically of General David Petraeus who as far as we know was showing sensitive and classified material to someone he was having an affair with and, you know, he got off with barely even a slap on the on the wrist and it hasn't affected his livelihood. Hillary Clinton had a private email server where she had thousands of emails, some of which the government said should have been classified. Nothing, nothing ever happens as a result of that criminally, whatsoever. And then you have Reality Winner doing five years in prison for allegedly leaking one piece of paper about the 2016 elections and attempts by the Russian GRU to probe or cyberattack software systems being used in some states for elections. You have Daniel Hale facing half a century in prison for allegedly blowing the whistle on a global assassination program that existed with a parallel justice system where the president decided who could be killed or who lived on any given day. But that juxtaposition between official leakers, powerful people who do this kind of stuff and then whistleblowers of conscience.\n\nTT: Well, that's why these cases are such a total farce. I mean, think back to the Obama administration. They were claiming up until the very end that large portions of the drone strike program were totally classified, that they would barely talk about it on the record -\n\nJS: Obama's first mention was joking that he was going to send a drone to kill one of the Jonas Brothers if they came near his daughters.\n\nBO: Boys, don't get any ideas. I have two words for you: predator drones. You will never see it coming.\n\n[Crowd laughs.]\n\nTT: Right, they can joke about it but then when there's a lawsuit against them, they claim it's a state secret. Yet we read dozens and dozens of articles at the time about the drone strike program, which a lot of that information, the Obama administration wanted out and so they leaked it to the New York Times. They leaked it to the Washington Post or the Wall Street Journal. These classified leaks are in the newspaper all the time. Same thing goes in the Trump administration. There are hundreds and hundreds of stories in every single major paper that contain classified information. At the same time, it is both incredibly important that newspapers can report on this stuff but it allows the government to essentially use the Espionage Act as this weapon as they see fit. They will let the leaks go that they want out there and then they will attack and prosecute the leakers who leaked things that they didn't want leak, that puts them in a bad light, that shows how they may be potentially killing civilians or engaging in illegal profiling. You can go on and on down the list.\n\nJS: What can ordinary people do and what should journalists be doing in response to the weaponization of the Espionage Act and this assault on journalistic sources in journalism?\n\nTT: As we've seen over the past two years, journalists in some cases have brought this issue of press freedom to the front pages of newspapers. Unfortunately, it has largely been about Trump's rhetoric which again, can be dangerous especially when you take it all together when seeing that he for months and months and months, every day attacking journalists. Yet, you know, we have to understand that this is just rhetoric at the same time. These actions that he is pressuring the Justice Department to take in again, in his public tweets, he is talking about how the Justice Department needs to go after leakers. So we know he wants this. But the second thing the public can do more broadly is talk about the Espionage Act with your member of Congress.\n\nSo far, even though we have known that this has been a huge issue for 10 years now virtually no member of Congress is willing to go after the Espionage Act partly because it's called the Espionage Act. They don't want to touch it with a ten-foot pole. But this law is being used against sources of journalists far more than its being used against actual spies and it is in dire need of reform or repeal. So if there are a brave member or two of Congress out there who can introduce a law that actually separates out the actual spies from these patriotic whistleblowers who are coming forward to inform the American people, it is of dire importance. Because if it keeps going this way, you know, you can imagine a situation as the government surveillance capabilities keep growing that it may be virtually impossible for any journalist to talk to a source without them being immediately outed.\n\nJS: What are some organizations that people could contribute to that support whistleblowers and the defense of whistleblowers?\n\nTT: Well, I'm a little biased but I would encourage everybody to check out Freedom of the Press Foundation where I'm executive director. Our URL is freedom.press. We work on these issues day-to-day. We build technology for journalists to communicate more securely with sources. So, for example Secure Drop which is our whistleblower submission system that we have helped over 70 news organizations install and is in use all the time even here at The Intercept. We also give digital security trainings to journalists so that they can have the tools that they need to figure out how they can communicate more closely with journalists. Because when you look at all these indictments, you can see that the government can paint this incredibly detailed picture of everything a government employee does because they have so many avenues to surveil them.\n\nSo, it's more important than ever. There are several other organizations that support whistleblowers that I would encourage everybody to check out. There's a new one called The Signal Networks, actually, that is looking to not only provide advocacy for whistleblowers, but actually the personal support that they need whether it's legal support, financial support or mental health support. You have to understand that even when these people don't go to jail, you know, there are dozens of investigations that don't go to indictment but these people often are bankrupted by legal fees. They are blacklisted from jobs and their lives can be ruined even if they don't go to jail because the government decided to target them for the crime of informing the American public about an important issue.\n\nJS: Trevor Timm, thanks so much for being with us.\n\nTT: Thanks for having me.\n\nJS: Trevor Timm is executive director of the Freedom of the Press Foundation. I should note that FPF has at times received funding from our parent company First Look Media. You can find Trevor on twitter at Trevor Timm. That has two \"M's.\"\n\nJS: For more than a month, activists have been camped out inside the Venezuelan embassy in Washington D.C. They've called themselves \"embassy protectors\" and they are there in an effort to try to stop the Trump administration from illegally invading what is Venezuelan soil, territory under international law.\n\nMedea Benjamin of Code Pink and other activists from Popular Resistance and ANSWER Coalition are leading the demonstration. Outside the embassy, there have been supporters of self-declared U.S.-backed \"president\" Juan Guaido engaged in a counter-protest.\n\nBrian Becker: The Trump administration acting on behalf of the most aggressive element like John Bolton and Mike Pompeo is engaged in brazen -\n\n[Horn.]\n\nUnknown speaker: So as you can see what's going on is the pro-Maduro side tried to hold a press conference since the pro-Guaido people are here to use sound makers, bang on pots and pans and things to basically try to de-platform them so they can't hold their press conference.\n\nJS: The anti-coup activists have remained in the embassy, even after electricity was cut off last week, water was shut down, and activists have been arrested throughout this action for trying to throw food and supplies to those inside. The very few remaining activists say they have enough supplies to continue their action.\n\nOn Monday, law enforcement began a more overt crackdown to remove the activists. A trespassing notice was posted by the D.C. police, and the chains that kept the doors locked shut were removed. Police came in, and a two-hour standoff ensued. The result was that the activists are, essentially, being allowed to stay. Now zip-ties remain on the doors, and threats from the U.S. government and Guaido-appointed \"ambassador\" to the United States, Carlos Vecchio, are mounting. The remaining days for this protest appear to be numbered, as the activists expect an official U.S. Government order for their eviction to be coming imminently. Earlier this week, the activists released a video message from inside the embassy.\n\nActivist: We are expecting the police to come in and violate the Vienna Convention with their fictional government, their non-government claiming that we should leave. It's an unlawful order and it will be found that way in the future. But we have no choice but to obey an unlawful order and so we are going to be prepared to be arrested. We're not going to leave voluntarily. We came here to protect the embassy. We've been here for 34 days. We would stay longer, if necessary. We hope that this still results in an agreement between Venezuela and the United States to protect this embassy from the fake government, the fake coup, non-government that the U.S. is pushing forward.\n\nJS: As the attempted coup in Venezuela continues to unfold, the Trump administration is further intensifying its military threats against Iran. This is a policy being largely spearheaded by National Security Advisor John Bolton, who spent his career advocating war and regime change in Iran. The New York Times reporting this week that the career Boeing executive- currently acting as the defense secretary - Patrick Shanahan presented plans last week for sending 120,000 U.S. troops to the region \"should Iran attack American forces or accelerate work on nuclear weapons.\" On May 5, Bolton announced that the USS Abraham Lincoln and a bomber task force were being deployed near Iran. The administration claims that it has information \"that Iran was building up its proxy forces' readiness to fight and was preparing them to attack American forces in the region.\" That's according to The New York Times.\n\nNow, in addition to all this, Trump is playing an extremely dangerous economic game with China and with the economic health of the United States and its people, workers, families. But the Boeing executive acting as Trump's defense secretary also suggested this week in an interview with Fox News aboard a plane that he views China as a potential military threat.\n\nBrian Kilmeade: It's hard to avoid China, what they're doing in terms of a military build up. Do you look at China as a threat?\n\nPatrick Shanahan: I don't think we can ignore China any longer.\n\nJS: Joining me now to discuss all of this as well as the fight for the Democratic nomination for president is Bill Fletcher Jr. He is the former president of TransAfrica Forum; a senior scholar with the Institute for Policy Studies; editorial board member of BlackCommentator.com; and Bill has worked in union and labor organizing for many years. Bill, thanks for joining me on Intercepted.\n\nBill Fletcher Jr.: Jeremy, it's great to be back online with you.\n\nJS: How do you see this moment that we're in right now in this country?\n\nBFJ: Many progressive people in the United States misestimated Trump and there were even people that described Trump as a closet peace candidate because they took his isolationist rhetoric too seriously. And what we didn't appreciate was that isolationism is not necessarily progressive and behind isolationism can often hide very nefarious right-wing objectives and that's what I think we're seeing playing out. We're seeing Trump playing to his xenophobic base. When they think make America great again, well, part of that is make America white again, but we have to really understand it is make America \"Leave it to Beaver\" again. That is make it back in the 1950s with the predominance of U.S. power.\n\nSo, these threats are not only dangerous, they're completely irrational. The other part though, Jeremy is that dealing with someone like this, it's frequently hard to determine to what extent they're engaged in bluffing. Because when you look at this man's career in business, it has been a series of bluffing and bullying but this time it may go too far. There could be, let's call it an accident, in the Persian Arabian Gulf. There could be an accident in the Formosa Straits, there could be an accident near Korea that will unleash immense terror.\n\nJS: Who's driving this ship right now?\n\nBFJ: I think on foreign policy, Pompeo and Bolton absolutely. What Pompeo and Bolton, I think appreciate, and I use that word carefully is that they need to play into Trump's macho, his self-image. I don't know that Trump actually wants a war but I think that one of the things that he is set on is readjusting the table. So that's what I think we see in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that he's basically made a decision that he will in essence change the situation so that there is no going back. There is no real possibility for two-state solution because he will put things in place that at least in his mind are irreversible and for Bolton, there's never been a war that Bolton hasn't been ready to start. He doesn't seem to appreciate the consequences and frankly, I think the administration totally mis-analyzes Iran. But I also think that they mis-analyze Venezuela.\n\nJS: Of course, we now have seen this week that the people calling themselves the Embassy Protectors, peace activists, anti-war activists and some journalists were inside of the Venezuelan Embassy.\n\n[Protestors chanting.]\n\nJS: They were largely ejected from the embassy and it seems like the Trump administration is trying to essentially take over what is sovereign territory of Venezuela and hand it to their selected leader, the self-declared president of Venezuela Juan Guaido. What's your analysis of this situation right now with Venezuela and the symbolism of what the administration is doing at the Venezuelan Embassy in Washington D.C.?\n\nBFJ: Well, what they're doing is patently illegal according to international law. They have no right to enter into sovereign territory. But what's important, Jeremy, for the listeners to appreciate is that this is an administration that could care less about international law. They are operating in the mode of The Dirty Harry characters of the 1970s and 80s that Clint Eastwood played. The Dirty Harry character, Harry Callahan would point a .44 magnum at someone and say -\n\nClint Eastwood [as Harry Callahan]: You're thinking did he fire six shots or only five? Now, to tell you the truth, I forgot myself in all this excitement. But being this is a .44 magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world and will blow your head clean off, you could ask yourself the question do I feel lucky?\n\nBFJ: And essentially what Trump has been doing is pointing that .44 magnum at the people of the world and asking at different points do they feel lucky? Their pointing it at Iran. Their pointing it at Venezuela. One of the things that we have in our favor is that within the political class in the United States there is absolutely no consensus in favor of a war with Iran. None. This is not like the lead-up to Iraq. And in this situation, this is when mass movements and pressure on elected officials really can make a difference and it's not just about hitting the send button on our emails. It's about people being in the streets. It's about people doing the kind of work that was done as you mentioned with the Venezuelan Embassy. People showing up to make their presence known and to defend Venezuelan sovereignty. We need to be doing that on a much larger scale.\n\nJS: When you have a situation where a criminal like Bashar al-Assad is in power in Syria and is engaged in mass killing and you also have the United States, Russia, Iran, Hezbollah, Emirates, all playing violent at times mass murderous roles, how as an anti-imperialist, do you approach what the best strategic but also moral position is on conflicts where intellectually and in a real sense, we recognize these aren't good people in charge of that country, but at the same time, our hands are not clean? We are not the legitimate brokers of who should be in power around the world in part based on our long bloody track record of interventions for conquest rather than liberation.\n\nBFJ: So, I think in order to answer the question you first have to start with that one of the problems on the left in the United States and in the west as a whole is that after the end of the Cold War we did not have a paradigm or an analysis to properly deal with a very different global situation. In the absence of that paradigm, what was easiest to do for many people was to retreat into the earlier analysis, to act in essence as if nothing really had changed, that instead of recognizing that we were in a multipolar world with various actors, there was a continued belief in many segments of the left that that wasn't the case, that the U.S. was the only player.\n\nThe second thing was a U.S.-centered or centric view that essentially looked at anywhere that the United States showed up, it obviously had to be the main enemy. And this was the failure to do a real analysis. And that's one of the things that we saw play out in Syria that instead of understanding the growth of a popular democratic movement against Assad and the crushing of that movement that was done by Assad in alliance with Iran, with Russia and Hezbollah, there were too many of us that were searching for what's the United States role in that and assuming that the United States was the major player. And I think that that was a misanalysis.\n\nThe second thing is to understand in looking at a situation, you got to figure out who is the principal enemy? That's not a matter of principle. In other words, it's not that one enemy is always the enemy. If that was the case during World War II, there would have been no united front against Nazi Germany, fascist Italy and fascist Japan. It wouldn't have been possible because clearly you were dealing with powers on the west that had not been very positive, that had played a terrible role in the colonial world, but under specific circumstances, alliances change.\n\nThe third thing is that there's been a reorganization of global capitalism. It's fundamentally different. That we've seen since the 1970s the rise of this sort of transnational capitalist class where the interconnections of capitalists through production and finances is unprecedented and this leads to contradictions that exist within that class and between that class and different nation-state actors. Let's take Venezuela for a second. I've had arguments with people on the left who are suggesting that the criticisms of the Maduro administration, many of which I would argue are quite justifiable, for heavy-handedness, for retreating on many of the promises of the Chavez era, for corruption, etcetera, that these criticisms justify some sort of support for the opposition. And that sort of analysis ignores history. It ignores the historic role of the United States in Latin America. It ignores the issue of basic sovereignty.\n\nEvery situation needs to be understood within this post-Cold War global context. And the second piece, is that we have to look at each situation and understand who are the internal and external players and what role is it? Now, this gets complicated, obviously. Let's just look at Iran for a second. The Iran theocracy is the farthest thing one could imagine from democracy. It is not a democratic administration at all. It is highly repressive, repressive of domestic minority groups, of labor, of women, etcetera. It played a terrible role in Syria. And a very complicated but not very good role in Iraq. Now, in that situation the Trump administration is threatening Iran. Now, do we sit back and say because of these reactionary features in the policy of Iran that we either take a pass on the U.S. threatening of Iran or support it as some people actually did in the lead up to the Iraq War? I'd say no, we have to understand the broader feature here. That one can be adamantly opposed to the Iranian regime while not supporting the jingoistic policies of the United States, the provocative policies to the United States.\n\nJS: Hmm, you know, this is something that I think is also being debated in this Trump moment where you have many of the leading Democrats portraying Trump as the greatest threat to American democratic principles that has ever resided in the White House and, you know, on some issues there, I think it's very clearly true. And then on the other hand, you'll have some Democrats supporting Trump getting sweeping executive powers to spy, record-shattering military budgets, support for the Trump-Bolton position on Venezuela coming from none other than Nancy Pelosi. And I think that there is a concern among people who don't believe that the United States government should be the top of the world that the establishment of both political parties that there is nothing that Trump could do that would be too extreme that would take away support for the solid imperial agenda of the United States. It's crazy making sometimes when you say well what, where is the opposition party?\n\nBFJ: One is that we have to see the consistencies in what Trump is doing with prior administrations and one of those things is treating Latin America and the Caribbean as the sphere of influence of the United States. That is a consistent policy through every administration and so, Trump is going forward with that. I think that we can see since the 1970s in the western world, the decreasing parameters for democracy. The rise of anti-terrorism legislation and restrictions, restrictions on freedom of speech, etcetera. So as neoliberal globalization consolidated, we saw an accompanying growth of authoritarianism across the world.\n\nSo when we look at what's happening now and what you're pointing out that at first glance appears to be this inconsistency of Democrats both embracing and attacking Trump, I think we have to understand the consistency since this rise of neoliberal globalization as a whole but also with regard to U.S. policy in Latin America. Having said that, Trump does represent, in my humble opinion, the greatest threat to constitutional democracy we've faced since Nixon. It's not just him and his administration, but it's the support, encouragement that he's giving to a right-wing populist movement that is becoming better organized and in some cases armed.\n\nThe question that exists within the political class and within the economic elites is at what moment do you put the brakes on this guy? For the Republicans, the answer is pretty simple. You don't. That Trump is a blunt force object that they're using to move a broader agenda. For the Democrats, it ends up being more complicated because many of these Democrats remained silent during the Obama administration, during the Clinton administration's when there were undemocratic moves afoot, at a minimum tolerated and in other cases, actively supported. So there is both this consistency, but there are also these contradictions and it's important for us to play on those contradictions.\n\nJS: Lay out how you think progressives, leftists should be thinking about the upcoming election and the Democratic primary.\n\nBFJ: First thing is that we have to understand that what's at stake in 2020 is not just the presidency. I think we have to look at the entire down-ballot situation. The second thing is that Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are the most progressive and that one of the things that I love about this moment is that this is a great moment for debate. So, this is a time when it's important for progressives to get in and to be actively involved in helping to shape the discussion. We've got to get Trump out in 2020, but there have to be also the building of independent political organizations that are progressive, that are operating both inside and outside of the Democratic party in order to influence all of these elections, Jeremy.\n\nFor a number of years, a segment of the Republican party has been moving a very quiet agenda to advance us to a constitutional convention. That is where the U.S. Constitution can in effect be re-written. Now, once upon a time, many progressives thought that this was just simply a conspiracy fantasy, but it's not. Who controls state legislatures is essential for blocking that. So, we on the left side of the aisle have to be looking at all of these elections and in the primary period, what's great about it is where you really can advance a more progressive agenda that talks about vision, talks about where we need to be going and that's what we need to be doing and it necessitates organization. And we have to figure out how to identify and train the kinds of candidates that really represent the will of working people so that we're not simply encumbered by whoever the Democratic party establishment puts before us.\n\nNow, you know, I will say, Jeremy, that in November 2020, I'm prepared to vote for almost whoever on the Democratic side is running against Trump. Four more years will undoubtedly mean at least two more openings for Trump to appoint people to the Supreme Court. And as it is with the majority, the conservative majority of the Supreme Court, we may be talking what 20-30 years in order to reverse that. So, the presidential elections are going to be critically important and sitting back or voting third party, I would argue is simply not an option at this point. It's not about rational arguments with Trump supporters. Rational arguments are going to make no difference. This is a fight about power. On the Democratic side, it's much more complicated. And although both parties are led by pro-capitalist forces, within the Democratic party, the constituency base is completely different from that of the Republicans.\n\nThe problem though is that the progressive forces are insufficiently organized on the Democratic side and frequently are reluctant or unable to make challenges for power. Episodically, yes, but not in a consistent way and that's what makes it so important that at the level of strategy, we're fighting and building independent political organizations in the states where we're actually making challenges. Joe Biden at the level of the presidential primaries should not get a pass any more than Hillary Clinton should have. We should shy away from this issue of electability and recognize that Trump wasn't supposed to be electable. That electability is something about the nature of the moment, the mass following, how energized people are and levels of organization.\n\nSo, now is not the time for premature compromises and going for the okey-doke. Now is the time to build up our forces in order to advance the progressive agenda and to situate progressives were either it is our candidate that ends up at the top of the ticket and our candidates on the down ballot tickets or that we are in significantly influential roles to help to determine the outcome.\n\nJS: I want to thank you very much, Bill for all the work you've done over the course of your life and also for joining us here on Intercepted.\n\nBFJ: This is a pleasure, Jeremy. Thanks so much for asking me.\n\nJS: Bill Fletcher Jr. is the former president of TransAfrica Forum, a senior scholar with the Institute for Policy Studies, long time labor organizer and activist. He is on Twitter at @BillFletcherJr.\n\nSarah Weddington: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court, the instant case is a direct appeal from a decision of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. The court declared the Texas abortion law to be unconstitutional for two reasons. First, that the law was impermissibly vague and second, that it violated a woman's right to determine to continue or terminate a pregnancy.\n\nNBC News: ...is the decision of the United State Supreme Court, it handed down a historic decision about abortion. The court said in a 7-2 decision that in the first three months of pregnancy, only the woman and her physician may decide whether she may have an abortion.\n\nJS: Attempts to erode and eliminate abortion protections have been unrelenting since the 1973 Supreme Court decision protecting a woman's right to terminate a pregnancy. In the last decade though, about 400 abortion restrictions have been enacted, representing more than a third of all enacted since Roe v. Wade. While many more states are taking steps to protect abortion access, a number of states are passing extreme abortion bans .\n\nAlabama lawmakers would ban the procedure outright. Abortion providers could face f elony charges and up to 99 years in prison. Last week, Georgia passed a similar bill banning abortions as early as six weeks, before many women even know they're pregnant.\n\nJoining me to discuss the implications of the Georgia abortion ban is public health doctor Krystal Redman. She is the executive director of SPARK Reproductive Justice Now an organization defending the full range of family planning options for Georgians.\n\nKrystal Redman, welcome to Intercepted.\n\nKrystal Redman: Absolutely. Thank you for having me.\n\nJS: So last Tuesday, Georgia became the latest state to enact one of these incredibly restrictive abortion laws. Start first by telling us about this bill that passed last week and the implications.\n\nKR: The legislators that pushed this bill were trying to really identify a point of viability which is something that medical professionals do and basically stating that at the point of a heartbeat, that's when a person can no longer receive or seek abortion care services.\n\nMark Strassmann: Georgia's new law shreds the standard set in the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. The U.S. Supreme Court established a woman's right to an abortion until the fetus is viable outside the womb roughly 24 weeks into a pregnancy.\n\nKR: Their definition of when a heartbeat is detected is up to about six weeks when we know at that point, there's no heart. What we're hearing in ultrasound is rhythmic fetal tissue, but it's not a developed heart. So there's all these potential medical concerns when you're speaking specifically about science. Outside of that, other potential implications are the criminalization of not just the person who is pregnant, but also the medical provider. It does not really clarify the difference between a medical abortion and miscarriage meaning if a person was to then have or suffer from a miscarriage is that person now subject to criminalization under the law?\n\nThey made an exception for incest and rape victims. So in that case, if a person suffers through the traumatic experience of their body being violated, now, we're requiring them to report the harm done to their body. We've asked in hearings so if a law enforcement person does not believe this person's story which we know is very common or refuses to report it or what have you because they may accuse this person of just perhaps wanting an abortion. So, like there's all these other types of criminalization that's going to be done to Georgians here that folks are not considering especially in relation to our maternal, child health outcomes as they stand.\n\nJS: Can you describe the existing landscape in Georgia when it comes to access to abortion and reproductive health care in general?\n\nKR: We already have restrictive laws as it pertains to just services in general. But with abortion care services, we have a Woman's Right to Know Act. So, there's already bans put in place that delays a person's ability to access those services as it stands. In addition to the pop up these we call them, crisis pregnancy centers, but they are also known as fake clinics that say that they're here to provide reproductive health services, but they're really put in place to try to deter someone from making that decision about their bodies if it even includes having an abortion. They have no medical license staff. So, there's all these different avenues that are regulating bodies here in Georgia and the government has inserted itself to play in the making of a decision about our own personal bodies and lives.\n\nJS: Is this a backdoor attempt to kind of goad people like you or other supporters of women's reproductive choice into suing so that it goes to an extremely right-wing Supreme Court with the endgame being abolition of Roe v. Wade?\n\nKR: It would be naive of me to think that that's not a strategy. But what we do know is that for every state that has attempted this, they have been sued and has been stopped in the local courts.\n\nDoug Richards: Georgia is one of six states that have passed heartbeat bills. Courts have already struck down two of them. Lawsuits are pending in three more.\n\nKR: Based on what has happened historically with other states that Georgia is any different, I think we will be able to stop this. Of course, we didn't foresee this, what we're going through right now, but I don't think this is a situation where this can carry on to a larger corridor or really just shift the decision of the Supreme Court Roe v. Wade. But our state is very conservative in its policies and its laws so, the hope and the pulse on the ground is that we believe that we'll follow suit after the other states and be able to stop this currently. But again, we are still on the ground. We are still strategizing about other ways to dismantle this, if in fact we're not able to stop it in courts.\n\nJS: And you yourself are a public health doctor and in response to Georgia Governor Brian Kemp signing this bill, you wrote the following: \"It is a forced pregnancy bill that denies a person their right to self-determination and bodily autonomy. This is a critical public health issue and if this ban is put in place, it will become an injurious public health crisis for this state.\" What are the public health implications of this bill?\n\nKR: Well, I would like to give a scenario. So, in Georgia, we have the worst in our nation maternal health outcomes including morbidity outcomes. So, in terms of obesity, in terms of high blood pressure, in terms of birthing outcomes, when carrying a child to term, in terms of all of these different medical implications that a person has just by nature of living in the state of Georgia, it's all high risk. One, we're a state that did not expand Medicaid. So we have folks that fall into the Medicaid gap meaning they don't have any coverage. We have a multitude of different counties here in Georgia that do not have gynecological services and do not have medical services. Some counties that have to travel up to a hundred miles just to receive emergency care services.\n\nSo in addition to that, you have a person that may be underinsured or not insured, who may already have pre-existing medical conditions that they may or may not be aware of because of their limited access to care, who then becomes pregnant and may want to decide an abortion but because of this law - if enacted in January at the top of 2020 - being in place now is being forced into a pregnancy that can cause additional harm to their body and potentially risk their life. This bill does not have any clause to discuss that true living example of a Georgian that what happens to that person then if they choose to decide to have an abortion, what happens to their health care then? So, that's just one scenario of potential health outcomes. But when you think about the landscape of Georgia, we have to think about all of the health outcomes of our state.\n\nJS: Now prior to working at your current organization SPARK, you were at the Georgia Department of Public Health and there you worked on creating a greater health care access for women around the state of Georgia. And ten years ago, Amnesty International, the human rights organization declared a \"maternal health care crisis in the U.S.\" and indicated, Amnesty International did, that Georgia was facing the highest maternal death rate. More recent reports suggest that that rate has not improved and that black women in particular, face alarming rates of maternal mortality and pregnancy complications. What do we know about why maternal mortality rates have risen in general in the U.S. and why these disparities in basic reproductive health care or basic health care for women of color, particularly black women are persisting?\n\nKR: We have to think about the demographics and just the data related to black person's in Georgia. And I won't just say black women because in this legislature, we have made this issue a very cis-centered issue when we know that queer folks, non-binary folks, intersex folks, trans folks also have abortions. Black folks living in Georgia have historically had poorer health care outcomes just because of the nature of their living conditions. You know, we think about social determinants of health and socioeconomic status and how these things directly affect a person's ability to live holistically and have full whole health. You also have to think about systemic ways of oppression that bears down on clearly, like black and brown folks specifically in the southeast.\n\nSo, I think those variables directly play a huge role in health care outcomes in Georgia. As I said before, because all those different dynamics, there's inequitable access to health care as well as inequitable access to health insurance. Now if you don't have access to coverage, how do you get coverage? Like how are you able to take care of your body? How are you able to get the diagnosis that you need to understand what's going on in your body as well as the medication or the treatment necessary for potentially pre-existing medical conditions?\n\nSo, for folks that don't have this access or have limited access to coverage to where they may have an element of coverage but it's too expensive for them to actually go to the doctor because their copay is too much or to actually pick up their prescription because a prescription is $100 plus when they only make $200 to $300 a week and have to live. So those are the dynamics of Georgians, of black Georgians here in the south. And I don't think it's just directly related to just black cis-women having poor health care outcomes. I think you have to look at the whole scale of what's going on in black and brown communities.\n\nJS: What strikes you about the way that abortion and reproductive justice or reproductive health issues are discussed in the broader media, debated in these state legislatures? What and who is missing from the conversation in your view?\n\nKR: I think the people who are centered in this legislation is missing. I think that we have a lot of cis, middle-aged white men having conversations and trying to make decisions about bodies that they are not familiar with, that, you know, they would never be able to carry a child in their body and deliver or become pregnant. But they are leading this narrative and conversation around protecting the lives of children and women in our nation and specifically, in Georgia.\n\nState Sen. PK Martin IV: Arguments about the rights and freedoms of women are compelling and they're not without merit. But they are incomplete and result in injustice and the oppression of the weakest people.\n\nState Rep. Ed Setzler: We've established the child, in utero that has a beating heart is a living distinct person that gets full legal rights under Georgia law.\n\nGov. Brian Kemp: We must protect life at all stages.\n\nKR: The narrative that's missing too is when we're speaking about children, when we're speaking about women, when we're speaking about people in Georgia, we're not thinking about all these other health outcomes that I mentioned before. We're not thinking about children who are in foster care systems that are being abused and under-resourced. When we're speaking about women, we're not speaking about incarcerated women. We're not speaking about how we can implement comprehensive health services behind bars.\n\nWe're not speaking about a multitude of different populations within Georgia. This issue specifically in the south disproportionately affects black folks. I don't see any black folks having these conversations or being brought into the conversation like folks on the ground, folks who have had abortions, folks that are a part of the reproductive health rights and justice movement. This conversation is centered on legislators. It's centered on folks who are creating these policies and laws who never, their lives never intersect here, which is very problematic.\n\nJS: Finally, Dr. Krystal Redman, what can or should people be doing to defend reproductive health care and abortion access and abortion rights? What should people be doing around this country right now?\n\nKR: I urge people to truly get involved at whatever capacity that they have. So, if it's being involved in different direct actions, reaching out to, you know, their local legislators, reaching out to their governor, whatever it may be. Making calls, sending emails, getting other folks galvanized is very important and truly re-engage back into the community so folks can really reactivate that kind of community-built power. Getting connected with advocacy groups such as our group or other groups that are more local to an individual. If you have the means to give financially to organizations that are doing this work on the ground too, as well because of course, with resources builds capacity which builds exposure which builds collective movement and power. So I think those are kind of like the marching orders for folks who may be listening.\n\nJS: Dr. Redman.

      "text": "GOP Platform Doesn't Mention the Word \"Climate\" Once - Even After Hottest Year on Record\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe Trump-led 2024 Republican platform instead calls for an American Iron Dome and the largest deportation operation ever.\n\n2023 was the hottest global year on record; data so far suggests that 2024 will match the trend. This week, more than 130 million Americans are under heat alerts, with numerous cases of death and illness being attributed to the sweltering heat. And amid it all, the 2024 Republican platform does not mention the word \"climate\" once.\n\nThe basic inanity underscores the malign interest driving one of two major American political parties: $300 million of donations to lawmakers from energy and natural resource interest groups (namely, fossil fuel companies) since 1990 - more than double the amount directed to Democrats during that same period.\n\nOn Monday, the Republican National Convention announced its platform, which affirmed that the party is wholly Donald Trump's. \"MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" the 16-page document's headline read .\n\nThe document paid no mind to environmental protection, never mind the 130 million Americans currently trudging through oppressive heat. But it did call to \"BUILD A GREAT IRON DOME MISSILE DEFENSE SHIELD OVER OUR ENTIRE COUNTRY,\" a reference to Israel's U.S.-funded defense system, and to \"CARRY OUT THE LARGEST DEPORTATION OPERATION IN AMERICAN HISTORY.\"\n\nThat the Trump-led, Republican agenda doesn't mention \"climate\" is not surprising. In his first term, the former president overturned some 100 environmental regulations, pulled the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Agreement, and weakened the Environmental Protection Agency. In April, Trump reportedly promised oil tycoons that he would reverse some of Joe Biden's climate policies in exchange for a $1 billion campaign contribution. Meanwhile, three of his Supreme Court justices just helped corporate America get even further off the hook from having to respect environmental regulation by overturning the Chevron doctrine , a decades-old legal precedent that directed courts to defer to federal agencies' interpretation of unambiguous statues.\n\n\"Trump can't mention it because every last one of his policies would make it worse. He's essentially running on heating the planet even more,\" Bill McKibben, environmentalist and founder of climate groups Third Act and 350.org, told The Intercept.\n\nIn an exchange with a young climate activist on the day the GOP's platform was released, Republican Sen. Katie Britt - framed by the party as \"America's mom\" before her memorable \"State of the Union\" response speech - embodied her party's dismissive response to the burning of our planet.\n\nHey @SenKatieBritt , you can run away from climate youth activists but can't escape the reality of climate change. Climate change intensifies extreme weather events. In Alabama, the state you represent, the sea level along the coast might rise 18 inches to 4 feet in the next... pic.twitter.com/ISwQ5mGQJ4\n\n\"Oh you, look at how dishonest that was. You asked if you could take a selfie and now you're asking questions,\" Britt said to a voter who asked her about money she receives from the oil and gas lobby. Britt proceeded to ask what the voter's issue was with \"Big Oil.\"\n\n\"I think that the climate crisis is here and getting worse, and you're being funded by the people who are making that happen,\" the activist said.\n\nThe senator from Alabama responded evasively, seeming to cheer on more toxic drilling. \"Listen, we've got to be not only energy independent, but energy dominant. We do it better than anybody.\"\n\nBritt did not respond to questions about her plan to address climate change and environmental protection, or about the $197,037 she has received from the oil and gas industries since joining Congress in 2022.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nIt's not as if modern Republicans have not engaged with climate. In 2021, Rep. John Curtis, R-Utah, launched the Conservative Climate Caucus in 2021 to educate Republicans on climate policies and legislation. \"Don't be too tough on us, but watch us. I am totally ready to be judged a year from on how much impact we've had on the debate,\" he said at the time of the group's founding.\n\nAs it turns out, the effort, which has received favorable media coverage since its inception, has not had much tangible impact. The group's members have attacked environmental regulations, undermined or simply refused to vote for bills like the Inflation Reduction Act, and taken hundreds of thousands of dollars from the fossil fuel industry.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "Jacobin\n\nLogin\n\nMany of the programs Donald Trump and Elon Musk are slashing are great collective achievements of American society. Those programs show our incredible capacity to achieve a better country and world together.\n\nUS President Donald Trump during a US ambassadors meeting in the Cabinet Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on March 25, 2025. (Shawn Thew / EPA / Bloomberg via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe losses we now face as Americans are dizzying and hard to even track, much less emotionally process - so much so that it's easy to lose track of what's at stake in the fight with oligarchs Elon Musk and Donald Trump: some of the greatest working-class achievements of the twentieth century.\n\nOddly for someone currently laying waste to those achievements, Trump has an instinctive grasp of how much they matter. In his quasi-State of the Union address several weeks ago, rhapsodizing eloquently about the wonders of America, he singled out the Hoover Dam - curious given his cuts to the Bureau of Reclamation, which oversees the dam, and given his clear determination to sabotage the collective accomplishments of New Deal, of which the dam is one.\n\nAnother great wonder of America that Trump mentioned in his speech was the Golden Gate Bridge, another New Deal-era creation. There again, ironies abound: that beautiful and aging bridge has structural problems, and the federal agency that has been monitoring and reporting on those issues, the National Transportation Safety Board, is also facing staff cuts by Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) - raising the alarming possibility that these structural problems could go unaddressed, leaving the bridge at risk of collapse.\n\nSpeaking of great government achievements of the twentieth century, our National Parks System (NPS) - more than eighty-five million acres of land - has long been the envy of much of the world. Even the Chinese government, no slouch at public infrastructure creation, regard s it as a model . Though the specifics vary and many of the NPS cuts have been overruled by courts, Musk and Trump have been significantly slashing staff from the parks.\n\nWe constantly celebrate our great wilderness in America, from legends about the frontier to \"the purple mountains' majesty\" of our national anthem to car ads that panoramically revel in the Western landscape. But the National Parks System is what has kept much of that glorious landscape from being turned into auto dealerships, coal mines, or strip malls, as it all would be if our oligarchs had their way. The National Parks have never been more popular, last year reaching a record high of 331.9 million visitors . We must protect these workers and these lands for the leisure and delight of the working class.\n\nWallace Stegner once called our national parks \"America's best idea.\" You wouldn't know it looking at our current political class, but there's considerable competition for that title.\n\nOur Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is also the envy of the world. It grew out of the government's malaria-prevention efforts during World War II and helped to virtually eliminate malaria, polio, and other illnesses from the United States. The CDC is also responsible for the eradication of smallpox, the only human disease we have completely eliminated.\n\nThe CDC is only one small piece of the massive federal infrastructure of medical research in the United State. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the primary funder of medical research in the United States, supporting cancer research that has saved some 3.8 million people's lives since 1991, and cutting the number of heart attack deaths in half between 1999 and 2020. Every single American benefits from its work.\n\nThe billions in NIH funding to universities support life-saving scientific research, but also help sustain our higher education system - tremendously fragile now and far more privatized and stratified than in most wealthy countries, but still one of the best in the world, unsurpassed by any other country in the variety of subjects offered and the diversity of expertise.\n\nOur K-12 system is free to every American child, and public schools are beloved by millions of Americans who use them. Yet Trump issued an executive order to eliminate the Department of Education. The Environmental Protection Agency has provided robust and popular regulation of our air, water, and ecosystems since its founding by President Richard Nixon; Musk and Trump are decimating it. Social Security, another New Deal program, keeps millions of elderly and disabled people above the poverty line and provides 40 percent of its recipients with their sole income; that agency is in a court battle for its existence in the face of DOGE's efforts to shut it down.\n\nPossibly unsurpassed by any other country is our federal information system. If you've ever tried to get concrete facts on any topic from a European government, you'll appreciate the helpful and brilliant workers at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the National Center for Education Statistics, and countless other agencies that exist just to inform us on how our society is doing so we can figure out how to improve it. All this is on the DOGE chopping block, as are the agencies that oversee and fund libraries, museums, and archives.\n\nThe daily acts of sabotage committed by Musk upon our federal government will cause great misery and suffering; they are wrecking our constitutional system, and not in a good way . But we're also not talking enough about the incredible achievements of our federal government, and the immense services our federal workers have long provided despite a hostile ruling class and a public sector that is notoriously stingy. Americans should be proud of what we've built and recognize that it's worth restoring and expanding.\n\nWe on the Left have often failed to tell the story of what we have. One reason we know there could be socialism in America is that our government and its workers have already built and achieved so much. We are now in this position of having to mourn and protest and try to stop these losses to our public sector, without having properly articulated what that public sector has done and what it is capable of doing.\n\nMany on the Left eschew patriotism. We tend to focus more on what is lacking in our system. We don't celebrate the immense accomplishments of the American public sector but campaign relentlessly on programs that don't yet exist.\n\nWe talk about universal childcare, but we don't say we know that can work because Head Start - under attack by DOGE - is already a great and successful program, producing better long-term educational outcomes for children enrolled in it. (An exception has been Bernie Sanders's call for Medicare for All, which in one phrase conveys the idea that we have much to build on and deserve much more.)\n\nWe talk about free college, but we don't say that we know our system can do this because thirty states already provide free community college, and the federal government already helps more than ten million more students with college tuition - another item potentially on the chopping block with Musk and Trump's attempted elimination of the Department of Education.\n\n\"Make America Great Again,\" Trump has been bellowing at us for more than a decade now. What's wrong with that phrase in and of itself? There is nothing amiss in the idea of American greatness, especially when it's tied to concepts of collective achievement and collective betterment rather than xenophobia, narcissism, and reactionary mean-spiritedness.\n\nNow is the time to talk about what has been great about America, and to defend what its working class has achieved and deserves, against the nihilistic oligarchs who pillage for their own enrichment. Now is the time to argue that it is deeply insulting to all of us to call our government and its workers \"waste\"; rather, our federal government is the foundation for a society in which we build beautiful things and everyone can thrive.\n\nThe Americans fighting back against the Trump/Musk demolition, especially federal workers , are on the front lines of defense against the ruling class's war on the very idea of a collective project. They know that the private sector has no incentive to and fundamentally cannot protect the places we love, educate our children, cure cancer, keep our bridges standing, or keep our elderly out of poverty. Only we the people can do that.\n\nLiza Featherstone is a columnist for Jacobin , a freelance journalist, and the author of Selling Women Short: The Landmark Battle for Workers' Rights at Wal-Mart .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Finish What We Started follows the Right's long march through America's political institutions.\n\nSupporters at a campaign rally for Donald Trump on April 27, 2023, in Manchester, New Hampshire.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nReview of Finish What We Started: The Maga Movement's Ground War to End Democracy by Isaac Arnsdorf (Little, Brown and Company, 2024)\n\nThe Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement around Donald Trump has proven far more successful at capturing both party institutions and mainstream support than both its Tea Party predecessor and Bernie Sanders's \"political revolution.\" Why? That depends on who you ask.\n\nWashington Post reporter Isaac Arnsdorf attempts to partially explain MAGA's recent success in Finish What We Started: The MAGA Movement's Ground War to End Democracy . Arnsdorf's book differs from much of the commentary on Trump in that it focuses squarely on the organizational machinations and ideas of the wider layer that gravitates to him.\n\nFinish What We Started follows a range of mostly low-level MAGA figures as they try to make sense of what is happening in American politics and intervene to influence it. The key focus here is the \"precinct strategy.\" It's a post-2020 blueprint to seize administrative control of local Republican party branches, then continue the process upward. The end goal is to make sure the 2024 election is won by Trump, no matter what happens on the day.\n\nArnsdorf keeps his editorializing to a minimum. He explains at the outset that he chose to focus on relatively minor MAGA leaders \"both because they are representative of thousands, maybe millions more like them, but also because they were in some ways exceptional.\" Those looking for gossip about Trump's inner circle will be disappointed: this is mostly a view of a changed party from the bottom up.\n\nArnsdorf's book serves as a nice companion piece to Ryan Grim 's The Squad: AOC and the Hope of a Political Revolution (2023) or Edward-Isaac Dovere 's Battle for the Soul: Inside the Democrats' Campaigns to Defeat Trump (2021). All three center on the interactions between political newcomers and party bureaucracies. The significance of these encounters is that they have the power to further or foreclose certain broader political possibilities.\n\nThe precinct strategy was dreamed up by an insurance lawyer from Wisconsin named Dan Schultz. It's pretty simple: stack the precincts, get MAGA chairs elected, control the administrative apparatus, purge anyone unsupportive, then refuse to acknowledge wins for non-MAGA candidates.\n\nSchultz's origin story for the plan involves being hazed in military academy and interrogating KGB agents while working in Army Intelligence. Schultz dubiously claims that at a meeting of the Minutemen Civil Defense Corps -  a neo-Nazi group terrorizing people at the US-Mexico border - a young man got up and declared that the real power in America lies with the Republican Party Precinct Committee chairs.\n\nSteve Bannon stumbled upon him in 2013 and Schultz began writing for Breitbart . But it wasn't until 2021, after Bannon began promoting him on War Room , that Schultz's content began to go viral online. Disillusioned MAGA supporters, smarting from their embarrassment after January 6, were open to new ideas. The precinct strategy offered a nice avenue for all involved to avoid embarrassment, feel productive, and engage in a bit of bloodletting.\n\nThe precinct strategy took off across America. It quickly becomes a carnivalesque suburban Cultural Revolution. Sexagenarian MAGA-red guards denounce long-standing precinct chairs as traitors. They begin prosecutory speeches with Merriam-Webster definitions of words like \"endorse,\" purging RINOs (Republican In Name Only) real and perceived with barely concealed libidinal delight. Even old folks' homes become unlikely show trial venues.\n\nFinish What We Started lets a range of MAGA diehards explain their take on the causes of contemporary polarization and what is to be done about it. But this is anticlimactic: most express little more than vague fears and suspicions, and enthusiasm for the precinct strategy.\n\nBannon is the one genuinely famous MAGA figure who features prominently, and he outlines the only developed theory (stolen in part from Bernie Sanders supporter Thomas Frank). Bannon argues that the fallout from 2008's global financial crisis immiserated the working class. \"Haves\" like the Koch brothers were for a time able to use culture war issues to manipulate the \"have-nots\" into electoral action that actually worsened the situation, but this trick has now stopped working.\n\nBannon explains that the Republicans are now really two parties in one: an elite party of big corporate interests and a working-class party of social interests. These interests are irreconcilable. MAGA, according to Bannon, is the working-class majority cohering en masse in their natural place against the pro-trade liberalization billionaires.\n\nThis is a generously focused recap: Arnsdorf also notes that Bannon's take includes mystical ideas about recurring historical epochs, clash of civilizations nonsense, and snippets from 1950s mass movement-focused pop psychology.\n\nBannon's \"analysis\" reads superficially like a structural explanation rooted in social antagonisms. This is intentional. Bannon delights in shocking fellow conservatives by calling himself a Leninist and is familiar enough with key terms to ape a class analysis. This is a fairly transparent ploy: he fully admits here that he thinks a layer of former Sanders supporters are recruitable to the MAGA movement.\n\nArnsdorf's approach in Finish What We Started is to largely let his subjects speak for themselves. This could be problematic, particularly if they were all as smooth as Bannon. It would simply be foolish to take such self-assessments at face value.\n\nFortunately, the rest of the cast inadvertently pokes holes in Bannon's account of the MAGA ascendancy. The sketches here are certainly of people who see themselves as the little guy - or at least on his side. But to call any of them working-class is a stretch. Every second character has started a weird business (of somewhat unclear purpose) in the course of their activism. These aren't exactly the gravediggers of capitalism trying to break their chains. They're more like funeral home owners offering discounts if you sign up today.\n\nThese isolated lawyers, real estate brokers, financial advisors, flag-shirt salesmen, event planners, and ad executives do seem genuinely buoyed by the human connection involved in their MAGA movement experiences. But they are absolutely not experiencing their political awakening as a worker's revolt. And why would they? They're all either general managers or proud owners of small- to medium-sized businesses.\n\nTheir pretty constant discussion of how they're going to be thrown in concentration camps makes more sense the more you get to know them. While they may not explain it exactly like this, theirs is a Taftian worldview in which freedom clearly means their own unrestricted prerogative as business owners to do as they please. They see literally anything else as totalitarian.\n\nAs the November election draws ever closer, political pundits are falling over themselves to make predictions about what a second Donald Trump presidency might look like. Some attempt to read the tea leaves of Trump's rambling speeches. Others commentate Trump's Apprentice -esque search for a vice president. Still more search among Trump's new, allegedly professionalized courtiers for clues as to what moves the once and future MAGA king might make.\n\nArnsdorf has tried something different: a narrative-based sociological study of an organizational strategy. There are certainly lots of memorable vignettes. One of Finish What You Started 's main characters declares that, while she doesn't need the stress and would rather be home watching Yellowstone ,\n\nshe was never giving up on politics. Even when it meant long nights in her windowless office at the Cobb GOP headquarters, with her signed Marjorie Taylor Greene yard sign and her poster mapping out the spiderweb connections between Karl Marx and Barack Obama, titled the AGENDA GRINDING AMERICA DOWN.\n\nUnfortunately, the sociological focus and the title are slightly at odds. The precinct strategy is supposed to be a stepping stone to getting Trump elected and then \"finishing what we started.\" But most of the players involved in this story never even speculate about what Trump might do when elected. Giving his ominous phrase the title spot feels a little cheap.\n\nBannon offers the clearest suggestion about what the phrase might mean: \"Economic nationalism . . . the second term is going to be ten-X more aggressive on the implementation of policy than the first.\" If this just means more tariffs designed to shore up profits and quick wins for Trump's buddies in select US industries , then the day-in and day-out efforts of some of the people featured here could take on a slightly sad dimension.\n\nThen again, these \" infantrymen of the lumpenbourgeoisie\" do spend an awful lot of time trying to swindle each other on the side of their organizing efforts. Characters in Finish What You Started will disappear mid-action, only to appear later and say they've dropped out of politics because their comrades scammed them out of money. Perhaps Bannon is partly right: in Trump's big grift, the shopkeepers have found their natural home.\n\nChris Dite is a teacher and union member.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Subscribe here to get it and unlimited access to our archive.\n\nWeeks into his second presidential term, Donald Trump is moving ahead with what his former confidant Steve Bannon called \" deconstructing the administrative state.\" Led by Elon Musk's advisory task force on government efficiency, this effort has already produced a wave of headlines and controversies.\n\nFar from preserving the status quo, as would befit a \"conservative\" government, the current administration seeks to reshape our future to mirror an idealized past. This peculiar form of \"progress\" grafts cutting-edge technologies of surveillance, information control, and mass murder, along with hefty doses of techno-optimism, onto a nostalgic Christian ethnonationalism. Whether Trumpism is actually fascist or not is beside the point: despite its futuristic trappings, it is less forward-looking than even the stagnant liberal politics it repudiates.\n\nThis mixing of past mythologies with present-day technology has a clear historical precedent. In the mid-1980s, historian of Nazism Jeffrey Herf coined the term \"reactionary modernism,\" which combined \"great enthusiasm for modern technology\" with a \"rejection of the Enlightenment and the values and institutions of liberal democracy.\" Herf showed how reactionary modernists in interwar Germany tarred abstract, intellectual, and profit-focused practices as \"Jewish\" and \"socialist\" while glorifying the tangible, \"spiritual,\" and entrepreneurial. In contrast to \"civilization,\" which they coded as Jewish, proto-Nazi and Nazi thinkers admired \"culture,\" which they believed could only be produced by people of German blood.\n\nToday the Trump administration and its Silicon Valley handmaidens are dusting off the reactionary modernist playbook. The blob of ideas that formed the basis of historical Nazism has, in the intervening century, rolled like a boulder through assorted ideological trash heaps, steadily accumulating material. To Nazism's borrowings from Teutonic legend and Eastern mysticism, today's Silicon Valley far right adduces the Horatio Alger myth, Misesian economics, and puerile science-fiction fantasies freely cribbed from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy or Stranger in a Strange Land .\n\nAs we're quickly learning, the results of this reactionary futurism are chaotic at best. Trump's first act of radical reshaping was to order numerous ( probably illegal ) budget cuts. On January 28, 2.3 million federal employees received an email with the subject line \"Fork in the Road\" that offered eight months of pay and benefits in exchange for their immediate resignation. By February 1, the administration had evidently granted Musk's task force access to \"sensitive Treasury data , including Social Security and Medicare customer payment systems.\" On February 7, forced leave began for thousands of employees of USAID, a foreign aid agency that has cultivated American soft power abroad since 1961. Other government bodies Trump and Musk seek to gut or abolish include the departments of Education and Agriculture , as well as the Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency . The goal is to cut the federal payroll by some 75 percent . Neither Musk nor any other Trump affiliate has indicated where the funds thus \"saved\" will subsequently go.\n\nMany of these measures proceed directly from Project 2025 , which stresses a \"continued alignment between agency leadership and White House priorities.\" Despite its euphemistic language, Project 2025 plainly announced the incoming government's intention to self-immolate. Voters who avoided reading that document or the copious news coverage dedicated to it could also have attended to Musk's promise to cause suffering to all Americans without exception (\"Everyone's going to have to take a haircut\").\n\nOne clue that the nation isn't in for a simple McKinseying - in which a business is asset stripped until it collapses - is the involvement of Musk. His particular brand of \"efficiency\" is supposed to be \"disruptive\" in a way that promotes \"innovation.\" Yet as Twitter's shareholders know all too well, Musk's interventions do not so much propel a company into the radiant capitalist future as pull it back into an unprofitable past . Trump 2.0's program similarly represents not a new golden age but a regression - toward models of disease control, economic growth, and environmental stewardship that other developed nations have long since discarded.\n\nThe very slogan \"Make America Great Again,\" with its telltale final word, \"again,\" suggests that arriving at future utopia will require a reversal of progress. Both Project 2025, with its genteel circumlocutions, and Trump, with his performative crudeness, couch the proposed trajectory in terms of reversing or rolling back or undoing Biden- or Obama-era policies. In 2016, Trump's attempts in this direction were ham-fisted and inefficient. But as of 2025, it looks as though the peeling back will be directed by tech oligarchs with a reputation for getting things done - \"future-oriented\" by definition.\n\nAmong Trump's boosters are self-described \" techno-optimists \" like Marc Andreessen who predict that \"our descendents [sic] will live in the stars.\" Immune to irony, these men are cozying up to the new administration, parlaying their conservative bona fides into lucrative government contracts for OpenAI, Palantir, and SpaceX. But tech's commitment to cost cutting stops at its own front door. The industry's latest innovation, artificial intelligence, consumes water and electricity the way the Ford F-150 consumes fuel.\n\nMAGA exemplifies what literary scholar Svetlana Boym called \" restorative nostalgia ,\" which \"does not think of itself as nostalgia, but rather as truth and tradition.\" By striving to remove entire populations of \"illegals,\" strip away women's bodily autonomy, and reduce sexual minorities to second-class citizens, this administration wishes to return not to 2020 or 2008 but to at least 1932, when Franklin Delano Roosevelt introduced the idea of the New Deal.\n\nOr perhaps even earlier. Even as they champion \"logic and reason,\" Silicon Valley techno-futurists are irrationally mired in the very distant past. Right-wing blogger Curtis Yarvin, an engineer and acolyte of PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel, pines for eighteenth-century Prussian monarchy. Then there is the singularity, a technological point of no return after which artificial intelligence will supposedly reign supreme. First popularized by Ray Kurzweil, the singularity relies on a futuristic imagination of triumphant technology at the same time that it draws deeply on archaic fears about the end of the world. Even on an individual level, the emotional underpinning of singularity theory is not optimism but simple fear of death.\n\nAs for Musk, he has followed many of his chronically online peers in becoming obsessed with ancient Rome. When he challenged Mark Zuckerberg to a cage match for manly tech billionaire supremacy, he dreamed of a livestream in which \"everything in camera frame will be ancient Rome , so nothing modern at all.\" Yet for someone who claims to think about the Roman Empire \" every day ,\" he knows very little about it, instead lightly basting his existing ideology in a vaguely Roman-flavored sauce. To bolster his arguments about \"replacement theory,\" Musk wrongly ascribed the empire's decline to falling birth rates . After his Sieg Heil at Trump's inauguration in January, Musk tried to reframe the gesture as a \"Roman salute\" - convinced, apparently, that ancient Romans really used the greeting (they did not ).\n\nLike its twentieth-century predecessors, today's far right longs for the purported glories of the ancient world, all while fetishizing modern technology. A favorite figure of Weimar-era proto-Nazis was the engineer who allegedly infused his technical prowess with a \"Germanic\" authenticity that hearkened back to the Middle Ages. The promotion of tech entrepreneurship in American culture since 2000 or so follows a similar pattern. Even as the tech sector collapses ( again ), children are encouraged to privilege STEM fields over the \"useless\" arts and humanities, while tech moguls like Musk and the late Steve Jobs are worshiped with almost religious fervor. To be entrepreneurial, we are told, is to be consummately American.\n\nAdherents of today's reactionary modernism disdain anything \"soft\" or \"unfit\" (\"facts don't care about your feelings\"; \"own the libs\"; \"snowflakes\") and aggressively defend \"traditional\" or \"authentic\" values. They tout \"Western civilization\" while pushing the United States toward absolutist monarchy or even feudalism, forms of social organization the West abandoned centuries ago. They champion the Enlightenment without acknowledging that eighteenth-century philosophers like David Hume, Voltaire, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau awakened whole peoples to the possibility that kings aren't necessary and might be overthrown.\n\nThe \"RETVRN\" to which Trump's tech industry friends aspire is not only morally bankrupt but intellectually dishonest. Their efforts to go backward will not help us recover the grandeur of antiquity, though we should expect more atavistic imperialism in the vein of \" annexing Canada .\" With the promised \"dismantling of the administrative state,\" we are witnessing a \"RETVRN\" to a time before the metanarrative of linear progress, to a cyclical, abstract archaism in which the operative noun is \"resource\" and the operative verb \"extraction.\" In this scheme, the past becomes a resource to be mined for politically expedient sound bites, humans mere raw material to be squeezed for man-hours, and the economy a slush fund for kleptocrats.\n\nReactionary modernism helps make sense of Trump's attempted razing of federal agencies and regulatory frameworks. The point is not to foster efficiency or streamline our government as though it were a business, which would be bad enough. Instead Trump and his ministers seek to reconstruct, on the ruins of our imperfect republic, a premodern state where power flows directly from the executive, unencumbered by rule of law or accountability to the electorate.\n\nTo \"RETVRN,\" in this way, is not to reinstate Roman aesthetics or lifestyles but Roman cruelty, to travel back to a time before Immanuel Kant's categorical imperative and France's Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. The revival of reactionary modernism is no harmless political steampunk. It's an attempt to hijack the future by forcing it to repeat the past, just with slightly better gadgets.\n\nBut this era's most important \"RETVRN\" may be to a state of nature. To cancel the few weak gestures our government has made toward acknowledging the humanity of the other, from our vestigial welfare state to investments in public education and environmental regulations to basic respect for minority groups, is to consign us once again to a \"war of all against all.\"\n\nThis article is a preview from the Spring 2025 issue of Jacobin .

Gage Skidmore\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nSince Donald Trump's victory in November, liberals have felt a profound sense of loss. After decades of defining the relevant facts and truths for others, they find themselves in a world that seems to have given up on factuality itself. As an exasperated Huffington Post contributor explained :\n\nThe greatest problem of our future is not political; it is not economic; it is not even rational. It's the battle of fact versus fiction. Sadly, a Trump victory illustrates that we are no longer able to distinguish between the two.\n\nIn \" The Fallacy of Post-Truth ,\" we recommended a healthy dose of skepticism toward this narrative. arguing that liberals who decry our post-factual age are really mourning the end of an era in which their statements of fact and value stood relatively undisputed. The age of truth never existed; the ruling class has always defined what counts as fact and fiction.\n\nBut even if you agree with this point, you might insist that Donald Trump - inaugurated at the half-empty and totally packed Washington Mall on January 20, 2017 - still profoundly threatens scientific fact and ethical truth.\n\nManash Firaq Bhattacharjee, criticizing our work in LA Review of Books , seems to think so:\n\n. . . the authors take their one-sided judgement too far by ignoring the \"fact\" that a fascist onslaught against truth is not a mere advancement of liberal misrepresentation, but its antithesis. A radical assault on democratic values by a fascist regime is not a worsening of liberal pretensions but a radical distortion of social reality and ethical values.\n\nThis argument shares many features with liberal nostalgia: both suggest that a firm affirmation of truth and values will defeat the grifter-in-chief. But if fact-checking and moral outrage couldn't stop the lying pussy-grabber from winning the election, how could they remove him from office?\n\nLiberals' favorite tactic - correcting their opponents on moral, factual, or procedural grounds - not only doesn't work, but it also reveals their strategic incompetence. We can only confront Trumpism once we recognize it as a symptom of American political culture, that must be attacked on a political terrain.\n\nNo doubt, Trump's election marks a rupture with previous administrations. But what kind of rupture? As we argued in the prequel to this text, many of the characteristics of the new \"post-truth era\" have been part of American politics - and all politics - for a long time.\n\nIndeed, the hate now directed toward Donald Trump closely resembles the hatred many progressives felt for Richard Nixon in the early 1970s. Tricky Dick personified all the ills of the United States' political culture: secrecy, lies, wars, and misuse of state power. Because liberals fully identified their political critique with one figure, they were left completely defenseless the day Nixon left office.\n\nPersonifying the problem blocked obvious and important questions: how did American political culture produce someone like Nixon? How did his administration reshape this culture? What would he leave behind? By failing to pose these questions, his opponents left the door open for the militarism, racism, and neoliberalism of our first B-list celebrity president, Ronald Reagan.\n\nTo avoid repeating this mistake, we must see Trump as an aggravating symptom: he reveals something about an underlying illness, while making the disease worse.\n\nTrump's candidacy does not represent a break with American political culture. His perverse appeal came from how he uncovered some of the foundational lies and distortions that underlie contemporary politics. With Trump, we could no longer see corporate-funded candidates as salt-of-the-earth defenders of the forgotten man; we had to recognize the falsity of claims that an impoverished Middle Eastern country posed an existential threat to American safety; we were forced to reckon with the contradiction between the political class's promises of imminent economic prosperity while implementing the neoliberal policies which impoverish millions.\n\nIn this context, Trump appeared to be at least an \"honest liar.\" He would enjoy transgressing ethical norms rather than playing the far less entertaining game of hypocrisy, shame, and guilt.\n\nTrump differs from past presidents not because he lies, bullshits, or engages in morally repulsive acts but because he does so shamelessly. His politics, we imagine, relieves some of his supporters of their sense of shame, as well.\n\nThis shamelessness begins to explain why liberal fact checking, both pre- and post-election, had no impact. What good can come from shaming the shameless?\n\nTrump's surprising success emboldened him to go further, reaching levels of dishonesty and immorality far beyond traditional politicians. But the fact that Trump and his ilk do not acknowledge common standards of truth and ethics does not mean that fact-checking and moralism can stop them.\n\nFact-checking only has power over only simple lies - statements the speaker knows not to be true. People lie for all sorts of reasons: to snatch an opportunity, to avoid extra work, or to cover up inconvenient facts. Paul Ryan's presentation of the Republican health-care plan falls very close to this category.\n\nBut fact-checking has no power against claims unconcerned with their own verifiability or against individuals beyond shame. It cannot correct what philosopher Harry Frankfurt calls \"bullshit\": speech with no regard for truth.\n\nBullshit does not try to replace truth with a lie. Instead, it creates pleasant-sounding landscapes of often-meaningless rhetoric that conform to its audience's preference. This format applies to most of Trump's speeches, but it also permeates American culture, from advertising to televangelism and reality television.\n\nFact-checking does nothing to disabuse people of the myths that structure their worldviews, which are neither factual nor completely fictional. Myths play a central role in people's moral orientation, because they reduce reality's murky struggles into simplified stories of good and evil, greatness and failure. The failure of liberal moralizing to stop Trump has everything to do with the power of myths.\n\nWhile most of Trump's utterances are bullshit, his nonsense is structured around some myths that allow him to project a certain coherence and orientation. This is an important reason for his success.\n\nMyths' power lies in their ability to radically simplify a complex world, helping people understand a chaotic and intelligible system. These stories must align with people's experiences, so myths pick out those pieces of reality that sustain their narrative and values.\n\nMost of Trump's utterances may count as bullshit, but he structures his nonsense around two long-standing narratives that grant his project a certain coherence and orientation.\n\nThe two key tenets central myths of Trumpism are: \"America was once great, but outsiders destroyed it,\" and \"Islam is a threat, and (only) I can protect you.\"\n\nHis opponents could successfully debunk these myths, but his supporters won't abandon a narrative that gives their world coherence without having another framework on hand. Unfortunately, liberal myths are either so weak or so close to Trump's own story that they provided no alternative.\n\nEstablishment liberals have two competing myths that once seemed incontestable: \"America is great\" (which morphed into the slogan \"America is already great\" in response to Trump's \"Make America Great Again\"), and \"America is a force for good in the world.\"\n\nThe collapse of these establishment myths allowed Trump to replace them with his own, reactionary stories, leading many to adopt far-right beliefs in order to orient themselves in the world.\n\nAmericans of color and the working poor have always seen through the myth of the United States' greatness. But while Obama could bring them to the polls by producing hope and promoting change, Clinton offered them nothing.\n\nMeanwhile Trump mobilized many whites for whom the myths had recently turned sour. Thirty years of stagnating wages, crumbling infrastructure, deindustrializing cities, and rising inequality - combined with promises that the rising tide would lift all boats - had tainted the narrative of American exceptionalism for these voters. The final straw came in 2008 when the housing market collapsed and the government bailed out the banks.\n\nThe catastrophic wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as the muddled intervention in Syria undermined the myth that the United States is a force of good in the world. Few outside the Washington bubble believe that lofty ideals - rather than economic and geopolitical interests - drive the ongoing incursions in the Middle East.\n\nAmericans have experienced these seemingly never-ending struggles in the form of body bags returning with children or spouses. Trump at least promised them something in return - grabbing all the oil, keeping America safe, or just getting revenge.\n\nTrump's campaign called bullshit on these establishment myths, and, even though he hasn't brought us any closer to the truth, he provided alternative myths that confirm what a lot of people know already: the United States has sacrificed a large part of its workforce on the altar of finance, free trade, and automation; the war on terror has failed.\n\nTrump the bullshit-artist became an unlikely truth-teller, revealing the lies and guilty disavowals of mainstream politicians. But to win, he had to appeal to broadly accepted myths. If bullshit is improvisation, myths are the structures on which the bullshit artist performs his sketch. The better known those structures are, the more people will follow the improvisation.\n\nAs much as Trump thrives on liberal ideology's collapse, he and his opponents actually agree on a number of points. Trump, mainstream Republicans, and Democrats all believe that the United States must remain preeminent among nations, that benevolent white men founded this country, and that every American citizen is a shareholder in the fortunes of American capitalism.\n\nThese stories promote a version of history that eliminates the role slavery and settler colonialism played in the nation's development and disavows class struggle.\n\nTrump smoothed his entrance into politics by building on voters' experience of authoritarianism in already-existing institutions - the army, the police force, the corporate sector, and the patriarchal family - and on citizens' silent acceptance of profound racism - in the disregard for brown and black lives in domestic and imperial policy as well as in Obama's mass deportation programs. The implicit celebration of capital's \"clarity\" and \"expertise\" over politics' \"messiness\" and \"partisanship\" cannot be divorced from the idea that a supposedly successful businessman could run America better than Congress. Few liberals question these facts.\n\nThese long-standing institutions and policies make Trump's proposals seem like reasonable extensions of current practice, called for by economic and military emergencies - a crisis mentality, we should note, that previous administrations also cultivated. Opponents can only undermine his wall, his deportations, his Muslim ban, and his authoritarianism by attacking the institutions and practices that found them.\n\nLiberal myths cannot lead the struggle against Trump. Most of them no longer mobilize supporters, while others too closely resemble Trump's own beliefs. Indeed, the focus on factuality, civility, and procedure in liberal centrism reveals that the Democratic Party has largely abandoned the struggle over ideas and now attaches itself to the reality of the current institutional setup.\n\nBelief in liberal myths has shattered. With nothing to replace them, centrists draw on a feeble tactical repertoire: from questioning procedure or competence to fact-checking and moral condemnation.\n\nWhile we agree that Trump embodies dishonesty and moral depravity, we believe that judgments about character, morality, and truth stand in the way of what needs to be done.\n\nThe first thing we must understand is that Trump - like Nixon - represents an aggravating symptom of US political culture. Trump the person is not the core problem; the world that made his presidency possible and the changes that will linger after he is gone demand political resistance.\n\nThe liberal refusal to recognize structural racism and diverging class interests has created space for Trumpism. Understanding this entails that we move the struggle against racism beyond diversity management and begin developing economic policies that genuinely benefit working-class people - not just those white working-class voters whom Trump mobilized, but also the white and non-white working-class people whom Hillary failed to mobilize, and the vast number of people who have been disenfranchised, never enfranchised, or simply chose not to vote.\n\nTo form collective interests that include the poor - whatever their background - it is necessary to break with the bipartisan myths of American preeminence, white entitlement, and national shareholder capitalism.\n\nFurther, a movement cannot be built on evidence-based policy speeches delivered by well-mannered politicians, nor can one be built on calls for impeachment or for intervention from the intelligence community. These approaches depoliticize people because they imply that those who created the world in which Trump thrives could get rid of him.\n\nOnce we understand that no one wants to die for technocratic governance, procedural decorum, or the deep state, then we begin to understand the importance of promoting ideas and practices that can bring together broad segments of the population. For all its limitations, the success of the Sanders campaign powerfully demonstrated that such a way forward still exists.\n\nBhattacharjee correctly describes fascism as a \"radical distortion of social reality and ethical values.\" But remember what Walter Sobchak says in The Big Lebowski : \"Say what you want about the tenets of National Socialism, Dude, at least it's an ethos.\" We would add: National Socialism constructed reality rather than simply distorting it.\n\nThe same applies to Trump. The torrent of bullshit and blustering late-night tweet storms still contain the kernels of a coherent ethos, of ideas people can believe in. Trump draws on the power of American liberalism's disavowed dark side; he negates its self-celebratory progressivism. Trump is the United States as we know it, liberated from its sense of shame.\n\nTo fight this reactionary wave, we must construct our own reality, based on ideals and practices of solidarity and economic justice. This politics would promise to free people from shame because it would engage them in the fight against the shameful. This project demands the critique of dearly loved liberal myths and institutions, genuine democratic participation, and real movement building.\n\nAny anti-Trump movement that doesn't reach beyond the president's personal antics will be powerless after he is gone. If Trump were impeached tomorrow, the world would still be stuck with Ryan, Pence, Breitbart , and the Koch brothers. Within and beyond the US our movements must oppose the world that created Trump, not just his revolting personality.\n\nRune Møller Stahl is a PhD candidate in political science at the University of Copenhagen and a former political adviser to the Parliamentary Group of the Red-Green Alliance.\n\nBue Rübner Hansen has a PhD from Queen Mary University.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe old world is dying. We are in a dangerous interregnum - between periods, with several paths to take. With the election of Donald Trump, we have taken steps down a very dark one.\n\nBut to get off it, we cannot return to the path that led us here. We are here precisely because we have gone down that path for so long.\n\nTrump represents a break with many aspects of neoliberalism. His campaign has lurched toward barbarity and promises to replace the whip of the market and the universal worker with fear of difference, nativism, the protection of decaying privilege, and the interests of an aspirational business class that is too weak to complete in global markets.\n\nSuch forces have long been building. But the Democrats, the principal party charged with opposing them, never identified these forces' true cause and failed to formulate appropriate solutions. They chalked it up to a moral failing of individuals - to the irredeemable \"deplorables.\"\n\nLast night's election showcased the full expression of those forces. The ruling class we once knew doesn't rule in quite the same way as it once did. Its ideas no longer hold sway. What exactly will take shape to replace it is yet to be seen.\n\nBut as conservatism is refashioned, American liberalism has come into its own crisis. Liberalism isn't withering away - it is being torn asunder. Its center has fallen out.\n\nThe vacuum that was left behind became a spawning point for ideas that blamed immigrants and others for the economic anxiety and misery neoliberalism brought. But American liberalism had no compelling response, nor solutions to the very real pain so many were feeling. Its coalition eroded as a result. It ignored the widespread decay and kept injecting the diseased body with the same medicine. \"America is already great,\" Hillary Clinton said in response to Donald Trump's signature phrase \"Make America Great Again\" - as if such a response offered any reassurance to the masses of people who hadn't felt such greatness for a long, long time.\n\nIf liberalism is to become an effective counterweight, it can't continue to offer up such lackluster ideas. Electoral coalitions can't be built upon the old technocratic, neoliberal platforms.\n\nIt is not enough to say you believe in and support diversity - we need an active and robust training and jobs program that makes economic security a reality for both workers of color and white workers who are suffering. It's not enough to say you support women's abortion rights - we need a minimum wage that gives poor and working-class women an actual ability to choose whether or not to exercise their rights.\n\nIt's not enough to tinker with health care and drive up prices, as Obamacare has done - we need a universal system. It's not enough to slap the hands of finance after it throws the world into a crisis - we need to fundamentally reorganize how finance works . It's not enough to be satisfied with the current jobs report - people want good jobs, not precarious ones.\n\nTrump tapped into this. We need to as well.\n\nWe should not celebrate the defeat of liberalism before we are on a better path. But we do need to understand it. Liberalism has fallen on its own sword. To defeat the alternative that Trump represents, we can't keep clinging to its dead or dying ideas.\n\nMichael A.

But it's also a political dud, reflecting the low-energy mood that pervades his newly announced presidential campaign.\n\nFormer US president Donald Trump announcing his reelection campaign at the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida, on November 15, 2022.(Alon Skuy / AFP via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\n\"A Massive Fraud [ sic ] of this type and magnitude allows for the termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution,\" Donald Trump wrote on his Twitter-copycat Truth Social page last weekend. He was upset that, in 2020, Twitter managers might have prevented a New York Post story from being posted on the platform. In his view, the platform's overreach invalidates the 2020 election results, which must be reversed by any means necessary.\n\nHis claim that Twitter's election bias necessitates the voiding of the Constitution is overkill even for Trump - and it suggests he is running out of whatever juice has powered his much more effective (if only slightly less unhinged) rhetoric in the past.\n\nJust four months ago, I argued that Donald Trump still posed a serious threat. While it's still too early to count him out, I admit I'm surprised that my article from July seems less accurate now that he has formally announced his reelection campaign. His anti-constitutional kvetching puts him at odds with American capitalists large and small, for whom the Constitution has worked exceedingly well and who form the core of Trump and the GOP's support base. His willingness to repel that base in order to score points on Truth Social suggests that his solipsism may finally be obstructing his path to power.\n\nCapitalists and right-wing activists have never shied away from tenuous interpretations of the Constitution. But, crucially, in doing so they universally present themselves as the Constitution's most enthusiastic supporters, who by their interventions want only to undo liberal misinterpretations of the founding document and restore its original intent .\n\nThis legal and rhetorical strategy allows them to advance their preferred policies without calling into question the United States' legal and historical framework, which, when compared to other countries, has proved remarkably stable, durable, and low-risk in allowing them to maintain their wealth and privileged position in society. They certainly don't want Trump throwing a monkey wrench into it.\n\nMuch of Trump's success came from his ability to sincerely express the Republican voter base's disturbing id and his inability to focus long enough to successfully enact any of his darker fantasies, which might have destabilized the constitutional status quo to a degree unpalatable to the country's elites. On some intuitive level, Trump seemed to understand this all along. \"Make America Great Again\" is just a catchier, more openly assertive version of constitutional originalism. But in calling for the \"termination\" of the Constitution, Trump exposed and undermined his own con.\n\nTrump's entire reelection campaign, announced in mid-November, has been curiously low energy. His focus is trained on increasingly obscure and inscrutable controversies, and his insecurity about hosting Kanye West for dinner, not to mention his mounting legal troubles , have come at the expense of traditional campaign activities such as raising money, hiring staff, or making any effort at all to dissuade rivals or persuade voters.\n\nMaybe at this point Trump is just running because he thinks it will help him avoid prosecution. Maybe he doesn't know what to do now that he doesn't shock us anymore. Or maybe his heart just isn't in it. It certainly seems like if he has to choose, he'd rather prove himself right than win back power.\n\nBen Beckett is an American writer in Vienna.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Don't count him out yet, though.\n\nFormer president Donald Trump speaks at the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida, on November 15, 2022, to announce his 2024 run for the White House. (Alon Skuy / AFP via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nWhen you announce a presidential run, you typically want to establish yourself as the front-runner by having some momentum behind you and demonstrating broad support from within your party. You certainly don't want to do it off a stunning electoral failure you're being widely blamed for, with members of your own party attacking you, and people in your inner circle advising you to delay the announcement.\n\nBut this is Donald Trump we're talking about. Could it have gone any other way?\n\nTrump defiantly announced his 2024 presidential campaign yesterday, a week after a disappointing GOP midterm election performance led his own advisers to urge him to delay the announcement. Having planned to take credit for what he thought would be a Republican landslide that never happened, Trump was in a bind: delay the event, looking weak and tacitly admitting the election didn't go his way, or barrel ahead with it anyway, pissing off the Republican establishment while insisting everything was going great. For anyone who's watched Trump the past six years, there was never any doubt what he'd do.\n\nThe speech was a relatively subdued one by Trump standards, heavy on the teleprompter and mostly free of references to made-up election fraud that have become synonymous with the former president over the past two years (though he did at one point allude to China playing \"a very active role in the 2020 election\"). It seemed a concerted attempt to present a more sober, serious, presidential Trump, after a spate of election-denying candidates in his mold fell short in their races last week, and the GOP's entire underperformance was blamed on his years' worth of efforts to cast doubt on and overturn the 2020 election result. Even so, Trump touted the win record of his endorsees (\"In the primaries, it was 98.6 percent, but they were still trying to blame me\") and took credit for the GOP's wave of victories in Florida, where his leading rival for the GOP nomination had just won reelection by 20 points.\n\nIt was also a far more listless speech, especially compared to the pretty fiery 2015 announcement that started it all. Where that event saw Trump come down a golden escalator to Neil Young's \"Rockin' in the Free World\" and immediately start attacking the various ways other countries, China above all, were taking advantage of a perennially losing United States, this Tuesday saw Trump shuffle up from within the crowd to the patriotic tones of Proud to Be an American , to complain about how the Golden Age he had built over his four years as president had been squandered.\n\nIn Trump's telling, he had spent his presidency as the guarantor of prosperity and economic security for all, stressing that every demographic group had done better under him, only to see his political opponents destroy the economy and the stable order he'd created. Having originally campaigned on restoring an America in decline, it was a neat way to marry the themes that had worked for Trump seven years ago while leap-frogging the awkward fact that he had just recently been president.\n\nSo once more, American greatness had to be restored, this time not because of decades of bad trade deals, corruption, and an out-of-touch elite that didn't care about American workers but because of Joe Biden and the \"radical left lunatics running our country right into the ground.\" Over his four years, Trump said, he had built a strong economy, ensured US energy independence, ended the practice of one-sided trade deals, created a peaceful world, and kept American adversaries in check. But in the less than two years he's been out of office, it had all unraveled, and now Trump was leading a diverse, working-class movement to save the United States from a corrupt establishment and \"radical left Democrats\" out to destroy the country. It was time to make America great again, again.\n\nTrump hit on familiar themes to that end, including a border that had been \"erased,\" a United States being \"invaded by millions upon millions,\" a deluge of \"thousands of pounds of deadly drugs,\" and lamenting the \"bloodsoaked streets of our once-great cities\" (\"How sad\"). He continued attacking the Green New Deal for \"destroying our country\" in a variety of ways, despite the fact that it's never actually been enacted.\n\nBut he also hit on some surprising themes. While touting how he had kept US adversaries under heel, Trump also boasted about his diplomatic efforts and that North Korea stopped launching long-range missiles after he and Kim Jong Un held a summit and developed a relationship. \"That's a good thing, not a bad thing,\" he added. \"It's a good thing. A very good thing actually.\" He likewise had some incongruously kind words for Mexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO): \"A great gentleman, a socialist, but that is okay. You can't have everything.\"\n\nTrump blamed Biden for \"leading us to the brink of nuclear war,\" mixing his criticism of the administration's Ukraine policy with climate denial, contrasting what he cast as a blasé attitude toward nuclear war to panic over climate change, which he falsely said would only come into effect in three hundred years. He also pointed to the fact that he is the first president in decades not to start a new war - which is strictly true, but ignores the fact that he only pulled back at the last minute from starting a pointless one with Iran because Tucker Carlson told him not to. At the same time, he attacked Biden over the Afghanistan withdrawal.\n\nThe statements may be a preview of what will be Trump's campaign strategy, should he win the nomination. So might be a line in the middle of the speech absolving himself of blame for the midterm result. Pointing to criticism of Republicans for faring badly in the midterms, he said that \"much of this blame is correct\" but also warned that voters \"have not yet realized the full extent and gravity of the pain our nation is going through.\" \"They don't quite feel it yet, but they will soon,\" he said ominously. Trump's hopes for a deteriorating economy giving him an election boost may well come true, if economists are correct that the Federal Reserve is pushing the country into a recession .\n\nBut to capitalize on such a scenario, Trump has to win the Republican primary first. And that may be a taller order at this point than anyone anticipated before last week's elections.\n\nThe loyalty Trump's commanded from Republican officials, even ones he openly humiliated and mistreated, stemmed from his perceived electoral strength and the hold he's had over the Republican base. Both have shown signs of slipping for some time, but they've been severely dented by this midterm result, and the knives are already out.\n\nA variety of right-wing commentators , even those like Candace Owens who crawled out of the primordial MAGA ooze, have criticized Trump in the wake of the result. The unflinchingly loyal Mike Pence, left high and dry by Trump during the storming of the Capitol last January, is saying the country will have \"better choices in the future\" than Trump. A number of peeved Republican senators are either withholding their endorsements or outright backing Florida governor Ron DeSantis, who was recently urged to run for president by eighty-six GOP officials in Utah. Longtime advisors and other allies are saying Trump shouldn't run or are considering jumping ship. Even Chris Christie, a hall of famer among the sizable ranks of Trump's most pathetic toadies, has suddenly found the guts to publicly attack Trump .\n\nThere are other reasons he should be worried. A number of polls carried out by the Club for Growth show DeSantis ahead of Trump in Florida, Georgia, Iowa, and New Hampshire, while a YouGov poll has DeSantis ahead nationally. A Texas GOP-commissioned poll has DeSantis leading Trump by ten points in the key state. The Wall Street Journal is warning its readers that Trump is \"most likely to produce a GOP loss and total power for the progressive left.\" Trump hasn't helped himself by lashing out at potential rivals Glenn Youngkin (\"Sounds Chinese, doesn't it?\") and DeSantis in bizarre and self-defeatin g ways. DeSantis recently struck back , telling reporters to \"go check out the scoreboard from last Tuesday night.\"\n\nThere's also the spider's web of investigations and possible prosecutions swirling around Trump, whether over alleged election fraud in Georgia, his mishandling of classified documents, or tax fraud in Manhattan. In the elite-favored US judicial system, Trump is still more likely to escape prosecution than not, but all of this could further hurt his claim to electability come 2024.\n\nThen again, Trump lashing out at anyone and everyone, carrying a load of scandals while the GOP establishment piles on, refusing to admit defeat or back down - we've seen this story before. Anyone with a working memory can recall the umpteen times Trump's 2016 campaign was declared over, that pundits declared this at long last would be the thing he can't come back from, the long list of commentators and politicians who proudly declared their opposition to Trump, only to fall in line anyway. Trump may be down right now, but it's never been a good bet to count him out.\n\nOne thing's for sure: however it goes, the Republican contest is going to be entertaining for a while. After that, it'll be time to worry.\n\nBranko Marcetic is a Jacobin staff writer and the author of Yesterday's Man: The Case Against Joe Biden .

A flock of old and new leaders are rising up, declaring that our best days are behind us and that they are the most qualified to build a better yesterday. Forget about the future, they say, the past is now the place to be - but not everyone is invited.\n\nIn the US, Donald Trump is heading to the White House after famously promising to \"Make America Great Again\" and bring back \"the good old days,\" while proposing a ban on all Muslim immigration to clear the way. In France, Marine Le Pen tops the polls with similar incantations: eulogies on a proud past, blaming \"the Muslim threat\" for its demise. In Russia, Vladimir Putin appeals to the country's historic greatness to attack the LGBTQ community and consolidate his power.\n\nAround the world - from Britain to Turkey to the Philippines - we see variants of the same theme: a nostalgic fervor for a proud past, coupled with a hostility toward \"outsiders.\" Imaginations of this past differ depending on the nation but, ultimately, they amount to the same thing: a phantom homeland with a strong sense of belonging.\n\nOn one level, such nostalgia is nothing new. Mythical memory has always been a pillar of nations, and rose-tinted recollection, the lament for lost times, is as old as memory itself. Asked how their day was, a proverbial Hungarian put it perfectly: \"Oh, you know, things are about average. Not as good as yesterday, better than tomorrow.\"\n\nBut even if nostalgia is a longstanding impulse, its content and prominence on the political stage change over time. Whereas nostalgia began as an individual disease, first diagnosed by a Swiss doctor in the seventeenth century - literally meaning the longing ( algia ) to return home ( nostos ) - and allegedly curable with opium and a trip to the Alps, today, this has been inverted: it is now nostalgia that is offered as the cure to all of our political ailments.\n\nOn the surface, conjuring up a happier past may seem benign. But much of today's nostalgia comes with its own set of noxious side effects. The bonds between those who belong to the remembered time are strengthened - they all feel at home - while for those who do not, their separation becomes all the more pronounced.\n\nOnly through the marginalization of others - foreigners, immigrants, LGBTQ people, all those who \"don't belong\" - can the reactionary nostalgists turn their remembered past into a site of empowerment. To turn back the clock, others must be turned out. With little else to latch on to, excluding others makes their past feel all the more precious, a thing that can truly be claimed as their own.\n\nThis is the dark irony beneath the nativist's angry refrain to the immigrant \"Go back to where you came from\": it is the xenophobe who, more than anyone, wants to go back to where they came from - to an imagined, pure point of origin, a moment in history where their country was a homogenous mass. The racist, like all great nostalgists, is homesick for a home they never had.\n\nThis nostalgia, and its dark underbelly, will be a difficult beast to reckon with. While the future can be fought over and the present is there to take or leave, the past can be - may always be - whatever we want it to be.\n\nNevertheless, understanding the forces propelling nostalgia's political resurgence may help break its toxic spell.\n\nIt's common knowledge that the temptation to look back rises as satisfaction with the present falls and faith in the future fades away. Memories of better times past - real or not - are an easy escape from feelings of insecurity and distance. Today, these feelings are all around us. \"On every level of human life,\" wrote the late Polish sociologist Zygmunt Bauman, \"you have the same situation. Uncertainty.\"\n\nThe main driver of this uncertainty, however, is not multiculturalism or immigration, as the nostalgic nationalists claim. The culprit is much bigger: global, neoliberal capitalism. By subjecting everything in the world to the logic of the market, capitalism creates enormous change in local communities with little to no regard for social cohesion.\n\nNew forms of work, transport, and communication are hurriedly born while others are quickly discarded; new forms of social relation arise, and others become obsolete. Soon the things people have been surrounded by, from black cabs to the post office, from steel factories to coal mines, have disappeared, and their identity along with them. Without any hope of improvement on the horizon - the Bank of England speaks of a \"lost decade\" - suddenly it is the present, not the past, that feels like a foreign country.\n\nIn order to fight nostalgic nationalism, then, it is not enough to strip the past of its halo. More importantly, a sense of hope - of a new, better future to come - must be restored. This is the great challenge for the Left.\n\nSince the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the symbolic death of utopia that it marked, progress has been defined as nothing more than incremental refinements of the neoliberal status quo. While some spoke of the End of History , what we really got was the End of the Future. Capitalism's never-ending newness became a never-ending stretch of the same - and, paradoxically, nostalgia the natural response: the past was the only place left for change.\n\nMany on the Left recognize the need for a new, hopeful alternative. They realize the urgency of formulating and fighting for a socialist politics that doesn't simply draw on the past.\n\nA good start would be to re-emphasize a core injustice that the Left has always rallied against. Economic inequality is the scourge that stares every capitalist society in the face; it is the malady that continues to grow worse and worse, and from which so many other sicknesses spring.\n\nThe statistics are well known: since the economic crash in 2008, the top 1 percent of earners in the US have received 95 percent of the growth in income. In the UK, it only took until January 4 for the average FTSE 100 boss to make as much money as the average worker will earn in the entire year. At the global level, eight men have as much wealth as the poorest 3.6 billion people combined.\n\nThese inequalities are monstrous. They are an affront to basic principles of justice and freedom. Overthrowing the class hierarchies that create them should be at the heart of every left campaign. Economic equality is a forward-facing ideal - inequality has always been with us; nostalgia is not an option. In the absence of such an ideal, people will keep feeding their hearts on past fantasies, not noticing when their hearts grow brutal from the fare.\n\nThe past should be seen as something to learn from and be inspired by; never as something perfect or inherently preferable. When we invoke it with longing, we also invoke the flaws, injustices, struggles, and suffering that always accompanied it. \"Time travel,\" Zadie Smith warns us, \"is a discretionary art: a pleasure trip for some and a horror story for others.\"\n\nOne person's nostalgia is another person's nightmare - and we don't need any more nightmares now.\n\nSamuel Earle is a freelance writer who lives in London.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

      "text": "Trump Didn't Invent \"Make America Great Again\"\n\nAndrew Kelly/Zuma\n\nDid you ever wonder why Donald Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" slogan took such root among the Republican base? Did it symbolize a return to an age when wages were higher and jobs more secure? Or was it coded racial language designed to signal a rollback to a time when people of color (and women) knew their place? In the soul-searching and recrimination among Democrats after Hillary Clinton's defeat, both theories have their champions.\n\nBut a closer look at conservative rhetoric in recent years reveals that \"Make America Great Again\" was not Trump's invention. It evolved from a phrase that became central to the Republican establishment during the Obama years: \"American exceptionalism.\" People often equate the expression with the notion that God made America \" a city upon a hill ,\" in the words of the Puritan colonist John Winthrop. However, as University of California-Berkeley sociology professor Jerome Karabel noted in a 2011 article, this usage only came into vogue after Barack Obama became president. Previously it was mainly used by academics to mean that America is an exception compared with other Western democracies, for better or worse, as illustrated by its top-notch universities or its bare-bones gun control.\n\nPrior to 2008, \"American exceptionalism\" appeared in news articles a handful of times a year, but after Obama was elected the references skyrocketed, largely because of a drumbeat from Republicans. Once the tea party wave made John Boehner speaker of the House in 2010, for example, he summarized the growing consensus among Republicans: Obama had turned his back on the Founding Fathers to the point where he \"refused to talk about American exceptionalism.\" (In fact, in 2009 the president had stated, \"I believe in American exceptionalism.\") The phrase's popularity in GOP talking points-often in attacks on Obama's \"socialist\" policies-paralleled the spread of conspiracy theories about his citizenship and supposed jihadi sympathies .\n\nDefending \"American exceptionalism\" was a theme of Mitt Romney's 2012 campaign; he blasted Obama for supposedly thinking that \"America's just another nation\" destined to become \"a European-style entitlement society.\" Romney's campaign co-chair John Sununu added that Obama should \"learn how to be an American.\" (He later apologized.)\n\nThe 2016 Republican presidential candidates and their surrogates sang the same tune. When Fox News pundit Sean Hannity asked Jeb Bush for his thoughts on exceptionalism, Bush replied , \"I do believe in American exceptionalism,\" unlike Obama, who \"is disrespecting our history and the extraordinary nature of our country.\" Rudy Giuliani was more explicit . \"I do not believe that the president loves America,\" he asserted, suggesting Obama did not think \"we're the most exceptional country in the world.\" During a speech a month later in Selma, Alabama, the president pointed out that the ongoing fight for civil rights is a cornerstone of what makes America exceptional .\n\nTo get more of a quantitative sense of the phrase's evolution, I analyzed the Republican Party platform. All party platforms typically emphasize faith in American greatness, but between 1856 and 2008, the GOP never used the expression \"American exceptionalism\" or even the adjective \"exceptional\" to describe the country. By contrast, the final section of the 2012 Republican platform lambasting the Obama presidency was titled \"American exceptionalism.\" The 2016 platform put the phrase into the first line of its preamble: \"We believe in American exceptionalism.\" The evolution of \"American exceptionalism\" into an anti-Obama rallying cry with nativist overtones evoked earlier appeals to \"states' rights\" to rouse whites resenting the end of segregation .\n\nIn his book Time to Get Tough: Making America #1 Again , Trump, too, framed his agenda as a defense of \"American exceptionalism.\" \"Maybe my biggest beef with Obama is his view that there's nothing special or exceptional about America-that we're no different than any other country.\" Trump later adopted a catchier slogan , \"Make America Great Again,\" but it retained the nativist overtones and racial dog whistles of the first. Paired with Trump's open conspiracy-mongering about Obama's forged birth certificate and supposed Muslim faith, it amplified and dramatized the Republican establishment's slyer assertions about Obama's un-American values.\n\nTrump would eventually abandon dog whistles in favor of blunter race-baiting . What remains to be seen is whether he and the Republican establishment will continue flashing the \"exceptionalism\" signal in the post-Obama years-to paint new opponents as un-American-or whether that language was uniquely deployed to delegitimize the nation's first black president. At the very least, it provided fertile ground for Trumpism.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

Ronald Reagan used the phrase \"let's make America great again\" in his 1980 presidential campaign. \"But he didn't trademark it,\" the Washington Post quotes Trump as saying. A regular businessman, Trump trademarked the phrase in 2012. \"I think I'm somebody that understands marketing,\" he said.\n\nSo, no, \"Make America Great Again\" was not \"made up by\" Trump.

      "text": "Trump Super-PAC Sent Out Bogus Medicare Cancellation Notice to Scare Voters About Kamala Harris\n\nMother Jones; Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post/Getty\n\nIn Arizona , older people recently received a mailer declaring Medicare had been cancelled. It had a big red stamp that proclaimed, \"Medicare Cancellation Notice.\" Also emblazoned on its front was this: \"Warning: Rates are going up & plans are being cancelled. Details enclosed.\" Its return address was the \"Department of Medicare Cancellation, Kamala Harris Administration.\"\n\nThat return address should have been a tip-off that this was not an official notification-along with a scrawled add-on in cursive: \"I hope you can afford to lose your insurance! - Kamala Harris XOXO.\"\n\nIt's hard to know whether any recipient saw this and received a shock, fearing their Medicare was being cut off. But the group that sent out this official-looking piece of campaign literature, Make America Great Again, Inc., a pro-Trump super PAC, was spreading false and misleading information about Medicare and about Harris.\n\nThe backside of the notice claimed that Harris is \"destroying Medicare.\" It said that due to Harris, Medicare premiums were skyrocketing and that she \"has a new plan that would completely liquidate Medicare funds,\" adding, \"All the money you've paid into Medicare will be gone.\" It dramatically asserted, \"Your care [will be] cancelled.\"\n\nNone of this is true. Medicare premiums are not skyrocketing. For instance, the standard monthly Part B premium went from $164.90 in 2023 to $174.70 this year . Harris has no \"new\" plan to \"completely liquidate Medicare funds.\" She recently proposed expanding Medicare to cover long-term, in-home health care and said the program would be paid for by negotiating lower drug prices. She also called for widening Medicare to include hearing and vision benefits.\n\nThe MAGA, Inc. mailer contained footnotes seemingly to back up its outlandish accusation. But they were vague and misleading. They appeared to point to references from years ago when Harris was a supporter of Medicare for All, which is no longer part of her policy agenda.\n\nMAGA, Inc. is the top pro-Trump super PAC. It has raised over $300 million during the 2024 campaign, most of it from Republican billionaires, including  Howard Lutnick, the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald; Paul Singer, a hedge fund manager; Charles Kushner, the father of Jared Kushner and real estate magnate who went to jail for tax evasion and for retaliating against a federal witness (and whom Trump pardoned); and Timothy Mellon, the reclusive heir to the Mellon banking fortune, who has pumped in over $150 million. (Mellon also gave $25 million to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s failed presidential campaign.) MAGA, Inc., according to a memo it released this summer, aims to spend at least $100 million in ads to portray Harris as \"the most radical liberal ever to run for President.\"\n\nMAGA, Inc., since its founding in 2022, has been a critical player in Trumpworld. Its first executive director was Taylor Budowich, a former Trump White House aide, who refused to cooperate with the House January 6 committee and who testified to the grand jury that investigated Trump's alleged swiping of classified documents. He joined the Trump campaign in August. Other staffers have included Steve Cheung , now the Trump campaign's combative spokesperson, and Chris LaCivita , co-manager of Trump's current presidential bid.\n\nMedicare is frequently a hot issue during a presidential campaign, in particular because seniors tend to vote at high rates. Harris' campaign cites her accomplishments regarding Medicare, pointing out that the Biden-Harris administration capped out-of-pocket spending for Medicare beneficiaries and limited the cost of insulin for recipients at $35 a month. It also provided Medicare the authority to negotiate lower prescription drug costs. And Medicare solvency improved during the Biden years.\n\nRepeatedly during the 2024 campaign, Trump has vowed not to cut Social Security or Medicare, though in March he did say in an interview , \"There is a lot you can do in terms of entitlements, in terms of cutting.\" (When he was president, Trump did propose Medicare cuts.) Tax experts have noted that Trump's proposal to exempt taxes on Social Security would lead to Social Security and Medicare receiving $1.6 trillion less in revenue in the next ten years and push each into insolvency sooner. (Project 2025-which Trump has tried to distance himself from-calls for changes in Medicare that would move more recipients into Medicare Advantage plans that are run by private insurance companies, and, according to Fortune , this could increase the financial pressure on Medicare .)\n\nMother Jones contacted MAGA, Inc. and asked if the super PAC intended for the mailer to look like an official notice and if it was concerned a recipient might at first be scared, believing his or her Medicare had been cancelled. It did not respond.\n\nMailers often convey the most scurrilous political attacks. Yet they tend to receive little media attention and routinely escape fact-checking and rebuttal. (As I reported recently , in Michigan, Jewish Republicans mailed out campaign literature accusing Harris, whose husband is Jewish, of being bad for Jews.) So it's unlikely that the seniors who saw this faux notice exclaiming Medicare has been shut down will subsequently receive a counter explaining that Medicare was not cancelled and is not being destroyed by Harris.\n\nPolitical campaigns can be sleazy affairs. But there is something particularly odious about billionaires attempting to frighten Medicare recipients with phony messaging in order to persuade them to vote for a guy who has proposed Medicare cuts and who will shower the wealthy with large tax breaks. But to them, this must seem a solid investment.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "What's Behind Trump's Plan to \"Restore American Beauty\"?\n\nMother Jones; Yuri Gripas/Abaca/Zuma; Getty\n\nWhen I first skimmed through the Republican Party's 2024 policy platform, a 16-page document titled \"MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!,\" much of it read as Trumpian but unsurprising. The platform, which is sprinkled with odd capitalization and an unusually high number of exclamation points, calls for launching the \"largest deportation program in American history,\" stopping \"woke\" government, and ending \"market-distorting restrictions\" on oil, natural gas, and coal. Though I hardly expected them to be , the terms \"climate change,\" \"global warming,\" or \"the environment\" aren't mentioned.\n\nBut there was one section that stood out to me. In a chapter titled, \"Bring Common Sense to Government and Renew the Pillars of American Civilization,\" the plan calls for the restoration of \"American Beauty\":\n\nRepublicans will promote beauty in Public Architecture and preserve our Natural Treasures. We will build cherished symbols of our Nation, and restore genuine Conservation efforts.\n\nThat was it. No elaboration. This, to me, is weird. What, specifically, are \"our National Treasures?\" What does it mean to restore \"genuine\" conservation efforts? And what is \"beauty\" in public architecture? As CNN quipped in its recent annotation of the party's platform, \"It's not clear when or how Republicans feel American beauty ended, but they clearly want to restore it.\" Of all things to rally behind, are Republicans calling for...prettier buildings?\n\nClues from Trump's time in office point to yes, actually. In a December 21, 2020, executive order , then-President Donald Trump praised Greek and Roman architecture for being designed to \"beautify public spaces and inspire civic pride.\" Similarly, classical-style buildings like the Lincoln Memorial, Capitol Building, Supreme Court, and White House, Trump remarked, \"have become iconic symbols of our system of government.\"\n\nBut by the 1950s and 60s, Trump wrote, government buildings became \"undistinguished\" and were seen as \"unappealing,\" tarnished by a Brutalist design aesthetic. He bashed San Francisco's Federal Building as being designed only for architects to appreciate. When the building opened in 2007, San Francisco Chronicle urban design critic John King praised its eco-friendly design, including natural ventilation, writing that it was \"architecture at its provocative best.\" Trump said residents saw it as \"one of the ugliest structures in their city.\" (I used to live in San Francisco. I don't disagree.) To remedy such travesties, Trump directed his administration to embrace classical and traditional architecture that would \"uplift and beautify public spaces, inspire the human spirit, ennoble the United States, and command respect from the general public.\" So the GOP's call to renew the \"pillars of American civilization,\" might literally mean building more pillars.\n\n\"Beauty\" doesn't exist in a vacuum.\n\nBut as some academics noted at the time, the use of classical architecture in the US has a fraught history. Reinhold Martin, an architecture professor at Columbia University, told the New York Times in 2020 that Trump's order, while having no real teeth, was \"an effort to use culture to send coded messages about white supremacy and political hegemony.\" As my former colleague Camille Squires has reported, there is a long, ugly history of pro-slavery Southerners deploying classical architecture to justify their cause. \"Beauty\" doesn't exist in a vacuum.\n\n\"National Treasures,\" meanwhile, could mean all sorts of things. Landmarks? Historic sites? Artifacts? The joy of a human that is Dolly Parton? (Only half kidding.) Again, the Trump administration offers some hints: In an August 2020 announcement celebrating the Great American Outdoors Act, a law granting $9.5 billion for national park maintenance, the White House praised America's national parks as \"our most important national treasures.\" So perhaps that's what the GOP platform means, but I wouldn't count on Trump to follow through on protecting them. A few months after he signed the Great American Outdoors Act, just days after losing the 2020 election, Trump's administration moved to undermine the law .\n\nAs for \"cherished symbols of our Nation\" and \"genuine\" conservation efforts-I have no idea. Does the GOP mean Trump's land conservation efforts (which were largely viewed as greenwashing ), conservation of species, or something else? I couldn't find any mention of these phrases in Trump administration records, and the Trump campaign has yet to respond to my request for clarification. (If they do, I'll be sure to update this post.) Last week, at Trump's order, delegates at the Republican National Convention passed this platform behind closed doors with almost no edits .\n\nBut perhaps the vagueness is the point. Whether intentional or not, by failing to define these terms, the Trump campaign can effectively quell the concerns of many voters who support clean air and water, land conservation, and wildlife protections, while failing to make any real commitments. Of course, without aggressive action at the highest level of government, we risk losing the natural beauty of the country as various environmental crises-climate change, biodiversity loss, ocean acidification, and more-stand to get worse. But hey, at least our buildings will look nice.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Donald Trump Does Not Have a \"Mandate\" for Any of This\n\nSamuel Corum/Pool/CNP/Zuma\n\nIn the 1932 presidential election, Franklin Delano Roosevelt wiped the floor with his Republican rival, Herbert Hoover. He won the Electoral College 472-59, and bested the incumbent with 57 percent of the popular vote. It was a decisive rout at a time of crises-a devastating depression, soaring inequality, rising fascism in Europe-and FDR embraced it, launching his New Deal. \"We do not distrust the future of essential democracy,\" he declared in his inaugural address. \"The people of the United States have not failed. In their need they have registered a mandate that they want direct, vigorous action.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who is doing his best to undo what remains of FDR's legacy, made similar claims in January-and in his address to Congress on Tuesday-of his own, narrow, victory, itself a response to crises ranging from real (inflation, war) to entirely fabricated (an immigrant crime wave, the Big Steal). \"My recent election,\" Trump remarked during his inaugural address, \"is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal and all of these many betrayals that have taken place and to give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy, and, indeed, their freedom.\"\n\nHe was hardly the only one invoking the m-word. \"Trump is back with a big agenda, a mandate-and an axe to grind,\" noted a Politico headline. Management and Budget officials justified their freeze on federal grants and loans based on \"the will of the American people,\" who had given Trump a \"mandate to increase the impact of every federal taxpayer dollar.\" Elon Musk, who has glommed onto Trump like a ravenous limpet, told White House reporters that \"you couldn't ask for a stronger mandate\" to eviscerate the administrative state: \"The people voted for major government reform, and that's what people are going to get.\"\n\nDid they really ? In his speech on Tuesday, Trump claimed-absurdly-that the November election \"was a mandate like has not been seen in many decades.\" In fact, Trump won less than half of the popular vote-which, given the turnout, amounts to less than one-third of registered voters. His margin of victory was the tightest since 2000, the fourth tightest since 1940. Subsequent polling showed solid majorities opposing his tariff plans, birthright citizenship ban, withdrawal from the Paris climate deal, January 6 pardons, and the renaming of the Gulf of Mexico. (People hated that.) Even Trump's own supporters deemed it unacceptable for him to impose loyalty tests on federal workers (58 percent) or to pardon friends or supporters convicted of crimes (57 percent). And this polling came before Trump unleashed Musk and his post-pubescent underlings on federal agencies like a swarm of diseased locusts.\n\n\"In the US, usually claiming a mandate is done when a victory has been particularly large,\" Terry Royed, a political scientist at the University of Alabama and co-editor of the 2019 book, Party Mandates and Democracy , told me via email. \"Trump's popular vote margin was not large.\" And when you consider his Electoral College margin and House and Senate swings, \"Trump didn't do super-well there, either,\" she added.\n\nFDR claimed mandates, too. But unlike Trump, he was reelected by a wide margin and his policies were very popular.\n\nLyndon Johnson in 1964 . Richard Nixon in 1972 . Ronald Reagan in 1984 . Those were big, decisive victories. But mandates ? Marquette University political scientist Julia Azari, who scrutinized more than 1,500 presidential communications for her 2014 book, Delivering the People's Message: The Changing Politics of the Presidential Mandate , questions the entire premise. Take 1964, she says: \"Some people were voting affirmatively for LBJ's agenda, but what really fractured the Republican coalition and led to that landslide was the fear of [Barry] Goldwater and the unpopularity of the things he was saying. And even there, there's a lot to choose from.\"\n\nAzari views mandates as merely a \"construction\"-an idea that has been used by monarchs, dictators, and (small d) democrats alike to justify their power since at least as far back as imperial China, when dynastic kings asserted a \" mandate of Heaven \"-a divine right to rule.\n\nThe Western notion of a mandat -as a command or judicial order- came about amid 16th century upheaval in Europe, as Reformation figures began challenging the hegemony of the Catholic Church. Before then, \"authority and inequality were linked; men of wealth and noble birth were also in charge of exercising the functions of government. The vast bulk of the population was politically irrelevant,\" the late German-American sociologist Reinhard Bendix-who was expelled from secondary school in 1933 for refusing to give the Nazi salute-wrote in his 1978 book, Kings or People . \"After 1500, the rigid bond between authority and inequality loosened.\"\n\nThe first American president to use the mandate concept as a power flex, Azari says, was Andrew Jackson, a Trump favorite. Elected in 1832, Jackson set out to destroy the nation's fledgling central bank , she wrote, \"rationalizing his actions by claiming the president enjoys a special popular endorsement.\" Eighty years later came President Woodrow Wilson, whose racist segregation of the federal workforce is echoed in Trump's DEI purges-and who, in 1908, wrote of a victorious presidential contender, \"Let him once win the admiration and confidence of the country, and no other single force can withstand him, no combination of forces will easily overpower him.\"\n\nPresidents of both parties, including Bill Clinton and Joe Biden , have since touted their electoral results to advance their agendas. But Trump and his minions have taken the claim to outlandish extremes, as if winning an election can empower a president to defy democratic norms, federal law, and the Constitution itself. As if the people had elected a king. (Trump has even hinted of his own mandate from Heaven, declaring, of his fortuitous turn away from the assassin's bullet, \"I was saved by God to make America great again.\")\n\nMandates are typically invoked, Azari has observed, when a president is on the defensive or when he seeks to vastly expand his powers. Both apply to Trump-whose approval ratings in reputable polls have never exceeded 49 percent-but also, interestingly, to FDR, who, frustrated by a conservative Supreme Court striking down some of his New Deal policies, declared his 1936 re-election results a mandate \"to save the Constitution from the Court and the Court from itself.\" The following year, he backed a bill, which failed, that would have let him add six new justices to the court. (Trump's toadies are calling for the impeachment of judges who rule against his executive actions.)\n\nSome within Trump's brain trust are openly supportive of his authoritarian ambitions, viewing the dismantling of government as a counterrevolution against an antidemocratic bureaucracy. \"We are living under FDR's personal monarchy 80 years later-without FDR,\" the billionaire tech investor Marc Andreessen said on a podcast in December.\n\nAndreessen was paraphrasing his \"good friend\" Curtis Yarvin , a self-styled political philosopher of the tech right who has lamented America's \"kinglessness.\" Now, he added, \"you need another FDR-like figure but in reverse...somebody who is actually willing to come in and take the thing by the throat.\"\n\nBut voters, for the most part, did not sign on to wipe out FDR's accomplishments-or Johnson's for that matter. Indeed, unlike Trump, FDR was reelected with an impressive majority. He won 60 percent of the vote, and took every state except Maine and Vermont. Mandates may not be real, Azari emphasizes, but margins matter. \"There was a lot of popular support for the New Deal,\" she told me. \"There's not necessarily a lot of popular support for undercutting the New Deal, undercutting the Great Society, and doing so in a way that has no procedural legitimacy.\"\n\nWill of the people? Hardly. Trump eked out a comeback win and kept himself out of prison-no more, no less.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

Michael Nigro/Pacific Press/ZUMA\n\nThe weather in Washington, DC, has plunged into the 20s, with a 40 percent chance of snow showers-and a 100 percent chance of bumping into someone who voted for Donald Trump. Our DC bureau chief, David Corn, bundled up against the chill and braved the slushy queues to speak with ecstatic Trump supporters who began attending a series of celebrations in the capital Sunday. The events were moved indoors to protect against the extreme cold.\n\nThousands of MAGA faithful packed into the Capital One Arena for an inauguration eve event. David joined the lines.\n\nWhile in line, David interviewed die-hard Trump supporters about their reasons for backing the president-elect. Among them was Andrew Williams, who praised Trump for not being like the other GOP war hawks. But what about Trump's proposed military annexation of Greenland? David asked.\n\nHe also watched-and recapped-Trump's victory rally, which included a long segment about Jesus from a duo of women who call themselves \"Girls Gone Bible.\"\n\nMeanwhile, our video correspondent Garrison Hayes took to the streets to ask Trump supporters what they are looking forward to. Some gave specific answers, such as the erosion of DEI requirements, while others offered vague calls for \"unity.\" One woman shared more ambitious plans: \"I would vote for him to be king,\" she said-perhaps jokingly.

Ironically, some of the very things that Donald Trump is promising to undo in the name of making America great again.\n\nIn the 19th century, the United States was not considered a \"great power\" like Britain, Russia or Austria-Hungary. But somehow it beat all of them to become the dominant global superpower by the second half of the 20th century - to the extent that it's often referred to as the American Century.\n\nHistorians all have their own theories about why this happened, but you can make a strong case for several factors that Trump has promised to roll back if elected to a second term: a fairly open immigration system that provided a steady stream of workers and spurred innovation; a strong and well-funded central government with a professional military and civil service that provided stability ; and an increasingly robust democracy that allowed the country to self-correct when it went astray.\n\nA stable government, immigration and democracy are what made America stronger than its rivals.\n\nLiberal critics of Trump often discuss these topics in terms of values, but I'm not talking about a \"shining city on a hill\" in which America is a beacon of hope for the rest of the world. I mean quite simply that a stable government, immigration and democracy are what made America stronger than its rivals, giving it a vigorous economy, a powerful military and an overall resilience.\n\nConsider immigration. In Trump's telling, immigrants are a drain on American resources, and diversity undermines the country. But in reality, immigrants provide a steady stream of workers who keep the economy humming and spur innovation. Immigrants, who contribute an estimated $2.2 trillion to the economy each year, are more likely to have an advanced degree , get a patent and start a business than native-born Americans. Just under half of the companies on the Fortune 500 in 2023 were founded by immigrants or their children, including Apple, Amazon, Google and Costco.\n\nThat's a powerful advantage that America has over countries that are less welcoming to outsiders.\n\nTrump would undermine that advantage. He has promised to deport millions of undocumented immigrants , end birthright citizenship , reinstate a travel ban on majority Muslim countries , implement \"strong ideological screening\" for immigrants, revoke Temporary Protected Status for some legal migrants and reduce refugee resettlement programs , among other things. The end result would be an America much less friendly to immigrants, and much less likely to benefit from their presence.\n\nBut Trump wouldn't just turn back the clock on immigration. He's also seeking to bring the government back to the 19th century.\n\nTrump's plan to make it easier to fire thousands of federal employees and replace them with loyalists would undo the 1883 reform that ended the spoils system and created the modern, merit-based civil service. His call for ending the federal income tax and funding the government entirely on tariffs would bring us back to the days of unstable government revenue before the 16th Amendment was ratified in 1913. And his desire for military leaders who are loyal to him would undermine the now-professional military that won two world wars in the 20th century.\n\nWhen Trump promised to make America great again, many Republican voters thought he meant the 1980s or maybe the 1950s. But it's increasingly clear he intends to take the country further back than that.\n\nWhen Trump promised to make America great again, many Republican voters thought he meant the 1980s or maybe the 1950s . But it's increasingly clear he intends to take the country further back than that. At a recent town hall, Trump gushed about how in the 1890s America was \"probably the wealthiest it ever was\" ( not true ). His allies dream about bringing back the Comstock Act of 1873 to block access to abortion. He's pledged to take advantage of the Insurrection Act of 1807 to send the military into American cities. And he's talked about reviving the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to speed up deportations.\n\nMeantime, Trump's attacks on the Constitution would take us back before 1789.\n\nTrump has threatened to jail reporters, editors and publishers who won't reveal confidential sources; to revoke broadcast licenses for networks whose coverage he disagrees with; and even to investigate journalists for treason . He's attacked the judges in his civil and criminal trials as well as their families , while saying it should be \"illegal\" to criticize judges he favors. He has said he would be a dictator for his first day in office , called for terminating the Constitution and refused to concede his loss in 2020, leading to a deadly assault on the Capitol.\n\nAgain, set aside for a moment whether these attacks offend your values and consider that they would also weaken America.\n\nA country without journalists ready to share uncomfortable truths, judges unafraid to rule against the wealthy and well connected and politicians willing to cede power when they lose will soon grow sclerotic. Bad ideas will flourish and good ones will be buried. Corruption will grow, adding unnecessary costs and providing poorer services, while businesses will stagnate. Meanwhile, mass deportations will reduce the workforce and tariffs will cause prices to skyrocket. And a military and civil service that cares only about pleasing the president will ignore risks, cover up mistakes and convey false strength.\n\nIf Trump wins a second term, the things that made America great in the 20th century will be unmade, one by one, and the American Century will be over.\n\nRyan Teague Beckwith is a newsletter editor for MSNBC.

He promised an immigration crackdown and targeted diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives , among other things.\n\nRead Trump's full inaugural address below:\n\nThank you very much, everybody. Thank you very, very much. Vice President Vance, Speaker Johnson, Senator Thune, Chief Justice Roberts, justices of the United States Supreme Court, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, President Biden, Vice President Harris, and my fellow citizens.\n\nThe Golden Age of America begins right now. From this day forward, our country will flourish and be respected again all over the world. We will be the envy of every nation, and we will not allow ourselves to be taken advantage of any longer during every single day of the Trump administration. I will, very simply, put America first.\n\nOur sovereignty will be reclaimed. Our safety will be restored. The scales of justice will be rebalanced. The vicious, violent and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department and our government will end and our top priority will be to create a nation that is proud, prosperous and free.\n\nAmerica will soon be greater, stronger and far more exceptional than ever before I return to the presidency, confident and optimistic that we are at the start of a thrilling new era of national success. A tide of change is sweeping the country. Sunlight is pouring over the entire world, and America has the chance to seize this opportunity like never before. But first, we must be honest about the challenges we face. While they are plentiful, they will be annihilated by this great momentum that the world is now witnessing.\n\nIn the United States of America, as we gather today, our government confronts a crisis of trust. For many years, a radical and corrupt establishment has extracted power and wealth from our citizens, while the pillars of our society lay broken and seemingly in complete disrepair. We now have a government that cannot manage even a simple crisis at home, while at the same time stumbling into a continuing catalog of catastrophic events abroad. It fails to protect our magnificent law-abiding American citizens but provides sanctuary and protection for dangerous criminals, many from prisons and mental institutions that have illegally entered our country from all over the world.\n\nWe have a government that has given unlimited funding to the defense of foreign borders but refuses to defend American borders, or, more importantly, its own people. Our country can no longer deliver basic services in times of emergency, as recently shown by the wonderful people of North Carolina being treated so badly and other states who are still suffering from a hurricane that took place many months ago. Or more recently, Los Angeles, where we are watching fires still tragically burn from weeks ago without even a token of defense. They're raging through the houses and communities, even affecting some of the wealthiest and most powerful individuals in our country, some of whom are sitting here right now. They don't have a home any longer. That's interesting, but we can't let this happen. Everyone is unable to do anything about it. That's going to change.\n\nWe have a public health system that does not deliver in times of disaster, yet, more money is spent on it than any country anywhere in the world, and we have an education system that teaches our children to be ashamed of themselves, in many cases, to hate our country, despite the love that we try so desperately to provide to them. All of this will change starting today, and it will change very quickly.\n\nMy recent election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal and all of these many betrayals that have taken place and to give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy, and indeed, their freedom. From this moment on, America's decline is over.\n\nOur liberties and our nation's glorious destiny will no longer be denied, and we will immediately restore the integrity, competency and loyalty of America's government. Over the past eight years, I have been tested and challenged more than any president in our 250-year history, and I've learned a lot along the way. The journey to reclaim our republic has not been an easy one, that I can tell you. Those who wish to stop our cause have tried to take my freedom and indeed to take my life just a few months ago. In a beautiful Pennsylvania field, an assassin's bullet ripped through my ear, but I felt then and believe, even more so now, that my life was saved for a reason. I was saved by God to make America great again.\n\nThat is why, each day, under our administration of American patriots, we will be working to meet every crisis with dignity and power and strength. We will move with purpose and speed to bring back hope, prosperity, safety and peace for citizens of every race, religion, color and creed. For American citizens, January 20, 2025, is Liberation Day.\n\nIt is my hope that our recent presidential election will be remembered as the greatest and most consequential election in the history of our country. As our victory showed, the entire nation is rapidly unifying behind our agenda, with dramatic increases in support from virtually every element of our society: young and old, men and women, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, urban, suburban, rural and, very importantly, we had a powerful win in all seven swing states and the popular vote, we won by millions of people.\n\nTo the Black and Hispanic communities. I want to thank you for the tremendous outpouring of love and trust that you have shown me with your vote. We set records, and I will not forget it. I've heard your voices in the campaign, and I look forward to working with you in the years to come. Today is Martin Luther King Day, and his honor, this will be a great honor, but in his honor, we will strive together to make his dream a reality. We will make his dream come true.\n\nNational unity is now returning to America, and confidence and pride is soaring like never before in everything we do. My administration will be inspired by a strong pursuit of excellence and unrelenting success. We will not forget our country. We will not forget our Constitution, and we will not forget our God. Can't do that.\n\nToday, I will sign a series of historic executive orders. With these actions, we will begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense. It's all about common sense. First, I will declare a national emergency at our southern border.\n\nAll illegal entry will immediately be halted, and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came. We will reinstate my \"Remain in Mexico\" policy.\n\nI will end the practice of catch and release, and I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country.\n\nUnder the orders I sign today, we will also be designating the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. And by invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to U.S. soil, including our cities and inner cities.\n\nAs commander in chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions, and that is exactly what I am going to do. We will do it at a level that nobody has ever seen before. Next, I will direct all members of my Cabinet to marshal the vast powers at their disposal to defeat what was record inflation and rapidly bring down costs and prices.\n\nThe inflation crisis was caused by massive overspending and escalating energy prices, and that is why today I will also declare a national energy emergency. We will drill, baby, drill.\n\nAmerica will be a manufacturing nation once again, and we have something that no other manufacturing nation will ever have: the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on Earth. And we are going to use it. Let me use it. We will bring prices down, fill our strategic reserves up again, right to the top, and export American energy all over the world. We will be a rich nation again, and it is that liquid gold under our feet that will help to do it. With my actions today, we will end the Green New Deal and we will revoke the electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto industry and keeping my sacred pledge to our great American auto workers.\n\nIn other words, you'll be able to buy the car of your choice. We will build automobiles in America again at a rate that nobody could have dreamt possible just a few years ago. And thank you to the auto workers of our nation for your inspiring vote of confidence. We did tremendously with their vote. I will immediately begin the overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers and families. Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens.\n\nFor this purpose, we are establishing the External Revenue Service to collect all tariffs, duties and revenues. It will be massive amounts of money pouring into our treasury coming from foreign sources. The American dream will soon be back and thriving like never before to restore competence and effectiveness to our federal government. My administration will establish the brand new Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nAfter years and years of illegal and unconstitutional federal efforts to restrict free expression, I will also sign an executive order to immediately stop all government censorship and bring back free speech to America.\n\nNever again will the immense power of the state be weaponized to persecute political opponents, something I know something about. We will not allow that to happen. It will not happen again under my leadership. We will restore fair, equal and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law. And we are going to bring law and order back to our cities.\n\nThis week, I will also end the government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private light. We will forge a society that is colorblind and merit-based. As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders: male and female. This week, I will reinstate any service members who were unjustly expelled from our military for objecting to the Covid vaccine mandate with full back pain.\n\nAnd I will sign an order to stop our warriors from being subjected to radical political theories and social experiments while on duty, it's going to end immediately. Our armed forces will be free to focus on their sole mission, defeating America's enemies.\n\nLike in 2017, we will again build the strongest military the world has ever seen. We will measure our success, not only by the battles we win, but also by the wars that we end, and perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into.\n\nMy proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier. That's what I want to be, a peacemaker and a unifier. I'm pleased to say that as of yesterday, one day before I assumed office, the hostages in the Middle East are coming back home to their families.\n\nThank you. America will reclaim its rightful place as the greatest, most powerful, most respected nation on earth, inspiring the awe and admiration of the entire world. A short time from now, we are going to be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, and we will restore the name of a great president, William McKinley, to Mount McKinley, where it should be and where it belongs.\n\nPresident McKinley made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent. He was a natural businessman and gave Teddy Roosevelt the money for many of the great things he did, including the Panama Canal, which has foolishly been given to the country of Panama after the United States.\n\nThe United States - I mean, think of this - spent more money than ever spent on a project before and lost 38,000 lives in the building of the Panama Canal. We have been treated very badly from this foolish gift that should have never been made, and Panama's promise to us has been broken. The purpose of our deal and the spirit of our treaty has been totally violated. American ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form, and that includes the United States Navy. And above all, China is operating the Panama Canal. And we didn't give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and we're taking it back. You. I\n\nAbove all, my message to Americans today is that it is time for us to once again act with courage, vigor and the vitality of history's greatest civilization. So as we liberate our nation, we will lead it to new heights of victory and success. We will not be deterred together. We will end the chronic disease epidemic and keep our children safe, healthy and disease-free.\n\nThe United States will once again consider itself a growing nation, one that increases our wealth, expands our territory, builds our cities, raises our expectations, and carries our flag into new and beautiful horizons. And we will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars, launching American astronauts to plant the stars and stripes on the planet Mars.\n\nThe ambition is the lifeblood of a great nation, and right now, our nation is more ambitious than any other. There's no nation like our nation. Americans are explorers, builders, innovators, entrepreneurs and pioneers. The spirit of the frontier is written into our hearts. The call of the next great adventure resounds from within our souls. Our American ancestors turned a small group of colonies on the edge of a vast continent into a mighty republic of the most extraordinary citizens on earth. No one comes close.\n\nAmericans pushed thousands of miles through a rugged land of untamed wilderness. They crossed deserts, scaled mountains, braved untold dangers, won the Wild West, ended slavery, rescued millions from tyranny, lifted billions from poverty, harnessed electricity, split the atom, launched mankind into the heavens and put the universe of human knowledge into the palm of the human hand. If we work together, there is nothing we cannot do and no dream we cannot achieve. Many people thought it was impossible for me to stage such a historic political comeback. But as you see today, here I am, the American people have spoken.\n\nI stand before you now as proof that you should never believe that something is impossible to do in America. The impossible is what we do best.\n\nFrom New York to Los Angeles, from Philadelphia to Phoenix, from Chicago to Miami, from Houston to right here in Washington, D.C., our country was forged and built by the generations of patriots who gave everything they had for our rights and for our freedom. They were farmers and soldiers, cowboys and factory workers, steel workers and coal miners, police officers and pioneers who pushed onward, marched forward, and let no obstacle defeat their spirit or their pride. Together, they laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, built great highways, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and triumphed over every single challenge that they faced. After all we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the four greatest years in American history. With your help, we will restore America'a promise, and we will rebuild the nation that we love. And we love it so much.\n\nWe are one people, one family and one glorious nation under God. So to every parent who dreams for their child and every child who dreams for their future, I am with you. I will fight for you, and I will win for you. We are going to win like never before.\n\nThank you. In recent years, our nation has suffered greatly, but we are going to bring it back and make it great again, greater than ever before. We will be a nation like no other, full of compassion, courage and exceptionalism. Our power will stop all wars and bring a new spirit of unity to a world that has been angry, violent and totally unpredictable. America will be respected again and admired again, including by people of religion, faith and goodwill. We will be prosperous, we will be proud. We will be strong, and we will win like never before. We will not be conquered, we will not be intimidated, we will not be broken, and we will not fail.\n\nFrom this day on, the United States of America will be a free, sovereign and independent nation. We will stand bravely. We will live proudly. We will dream boldly, and nothing will stand in our way. Because we are Americans, the future is ours, and our Golden Age has just begun. Thank you. God. Bless America. Thank you all.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

Activate your online access\n\nThe new president uses shock and awe to claim a mandate over demoralized Democrats.\n\nIn the run-up to Donald Trump's second inaugural address, his staff leaked a remarkable promise: that in this speech, we would see a kinder, gentler Donald Trump. This benign Trump would mark a change from the notorious \" American carnage \" tirade he delivered in 2017 the first time he was sworn in as president. Trump's \"American carnage\" inaugural painted a dystopian image of America as a nation going to hell in a handbasket due to a corrupt elite that only he could stop. After listening to the speech, George W. Bush reportedly said , \"That was some weird shit.\" For Trump 2.0, aides promised a unity message that would heal a nation divided after a bitter election as well as years of political strife.\n\nAnyone foolish enough to expect a new Trump should probably hand over power of attorney for their finances to their family now. Trump is incapable of either change or comity, so it should have come as no surprise that his second inaugural address was not the promised magnanimous gesture of reconciliation but just a new iteration of \"American carnage.\" Crudeness and repetition are Trump's stock in trade-and have served him well as a huckster and demagogue. In the second address, we heard the same basic underlying message as the first: Under the corrupt elite represented his opponents, America was becoming a hellscape, but with Trump in charge we'll now enjoy a new \"golden age\" of peace and prosperity brought about through an \"America First\" program of immigration crackdown, protectionism, and foreign policy unilateralism.\n\nThe main differences between the two speeches was a matter of tone and emphasis, as well as the overall level of confidence. Trump's 2017 speech was memorably angry. In today's speech, Trump, perhaps suffering from a cold, was much more subdued. In the new inaugural, Trump foregrounded the promise of a new \"golden age of America\" and in general focused more on what he could deliver-while still airing his grievances over his alleged persecution.\n\nIn 2017, Trump was beleaguered even in victory, since he lost the popular vote. In 2025, Trump has much more swagger, thanks not just to a popular vote victory but also the fact that Democrats are not putting up any significant resistance to his policies but abjectly waving the white flag of surrender (seen in the rush of many Democrats in Congress to support the GOP's anti-immigrant Laken Riley Act).\n\nThe New York Times reports that in a meeting last Friday with lawmakers, Trump\n\nsaid the Democrats were damaged, demoralized and disorganized, according to two people in the room. And while he conceded that \"sometimes a wounded animal is the most dangerous,\" he signaled that he wanted to exploit their weakness. It was time to go big.\n\nTrump's speech had the supreme confidence of a leader who knows his rivals are vanquished and licking their wounds. So Trump wasn't shy about claiming a mandate-not just from the voters but from God. About the election results, Trump said, \"As our victory showed, the entire nation is rapidly unifying behind our agenda, with dramatic increases in support from virtually every element of our society: young and old, men and women, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, urban, suburban, rural, and very importantly, we had a powerful win in all seven swing states, and the popular vote we won by millions of people.\"\n\nAs always, Trump was overstating his victory, which was narrow in historical terms (as my colleague John Nichols has documented ). While he did make impressive gains among many traditionally Democratic groups such as African Americans and Latinos, this was only in comparison to the very low rates he and other Republicans have received from these demographics. But Trump is never any mood to be fact-checked-let alone when he is victorious.\n\nIt wasn't just the voters who wanted him back in power, Trump insisted, but also the creator of the universe. Trump said,\n\nJust a few months ago, in that beautiful Pennsylvania field, an assassin's bullet ripped through my ear. But I felt then, and believe even more so now, that my life was saved for a reason. I was saved by God to make America great again.\n\nBelieving that both American voters and the Almighty are on his side, Trump barged forward with his America First agenda, including an especially strong emphasis on nativism. He promised a militarization of the southern border and a sweeping policy of deportation.\n\nElie Mystal\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nFeature / Vincent Bevins\n\nJeet Heer\n\nMore broadly, Trump is calling for nothing less than a return to the 19th-century notion of Manifest Destiny (a term he explicitly used) in the manner of William McKinley (whom he described as \"a great president\").\n\nTrump's version of Manifest Destiny includes not just old-fashioned imperialism (he even promised to take back the Panama Canal) but also a new expansion into the far reaches of space. According to Trump,\n\nThe United States will once again consider itself a growing nation, one that increases our wealth, expands our territory, builds our cities, raises our expectations and carries our flag into new and beautiful horizons. And we will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars, launching American astronauts to plant the stars and stripes on the planet Mars.\n\nTrump's claim to want to unify America is belied by his deeply reactionary politics, which explicitly aims to roll back the social progress made in recent decades by people of color (he called for an end to workplace diversity programs) and sexual minorities (decreeing that under his government federal policy will be that \"there are only two genders\").\n\nTrump's narrow electoral victory doesn't come close to giving him a mandate for the sweeping right-wing politics he's promising. Unfortunately, Trump has judged the moment correctly: As long as Democrats are demoralized, he has a chance to steamroller over them to push his agenda.\n\nThe most important political question Trump's speech raises is whether it will finally shock liberals enough that they will emerge from their funk-and start organizing a proper resistance.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Activate your online access\n\nYou can't make America great again by wrecking the government.\n\nWhat to make of the blur of news, revolutionary rhetoric, panicky fundraising texts, economic indicators, the plunging stock market , and, of course, President Trump's address to a joint session of Congress on March 4, 2025? Are we on the brink of a socioeconomic Armageddon? Or is there-as the great Tallulah Bankhead once said, \"less in this than meets the eye\"?\n\nLeaving aside the buckets called \"culture wars\" and \"foreign policy,\" we may distinguish eight distinct forces at work in Trump's economics. They are (a) the targeted destruction of specific regulatory agencies, (b) random disruptions of the federal civil service, (c) old-fashioned Reaganism, (d) tariffs, (e) migration, (f) energy, (g) the military, and (h) the general effect of rash and unpredictable policymaking-otherwise called uncertainty and chaos.\n\nTargeted destruction. Trump's early days have seen the declared end for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the National Labor Relations Board , crippling blows to the Environmental Protection Agency , and a start to dismantling the Department of Education , among others . These are regulatory and supervisory agencies specifically targeted by longtime adversaries, now empowered. Their demolition ( in whole or part ) is a political gesture that will weaken labor against business, consumers against bankers, and citizens against polluters. However, taken alone these will not have large economic effects in the short run.\n\nIn the longer run, systematic deregulation will degrade economic performance. Not all regulation is effective. But quite distinct from its social and health benefits, effective regulation serves the interests of advanced businesses, including in manufacturing, by forcing old, dirty, and unsafe technologies and low-wage competitors out. Trump's government, like others before it, is-unfortunately for its own declared strategy-in the hands of the reactionary branch of the business elite.\n\nArbitrary disruptions of the civil service occur through blanket measures such as the peremptory dismissal of probationary employees, pressured early retirements, office closings, and downsizing, notably at Veterans' Affairs , the Internal Revenue Service , the Social Security Administration , and other agencies, including the Forest Service and the National Park Service . The effect is to make those agencies less efficient at what they do. If there is a political strategy behind this, it is to deepen public frustration with the federal government, creating a feedback loop that can be exploited later. Over time, degrading the federal government will also degrade economic performance, fostering a race to the bottom as key functions are taken up, in part and inadequately, by state and local governments-or allowed to decay and disappear.\n\nOld-fashioned Reaganism turns up in Trump's budget: to cut spending (mostly Medicaid, if it happens), and cut taxes, while leaving defense alone. These are the most economically significant of Trump's measures-but their effect, relative to Reagan's, is doubtful. Medicaid now covers 90 million Americans; the program is popular, bipartisan, and may be difficult to cut . The Trump tax cuts are highly regressive-but they appear, so far, to be mainly extensions of current tax law that would otherwise expire. The Pentagon budget is already very high, which was not the case in 1981. Reaganomics did spur a strong recovery from the 1982 recession, giving Reagan his reelection boom. Trump's version may not have the same effect this time around.\n\nThe tariffs are the most dramatic of Trump's economic measures, because they lie within his sole discretion, and he can impose or retract them at will. In a simple world-like the one depicted in economics textbooks-they would fall straightforwardly on consumers or producers, and either way they foster import substitution on both sides of the tariff wall. In the real world of complex supply and production chains, they are highly disruptive and could kill the profits of major American firms-a fact that seems to have dawned, a bit late, on the Trump team. So the tariffs on Canada and Mexico were on-off-on and now off again, thanks (most likely) to stiff complaints from the auto makers . With respect to those countries, our largest and closest trading partners, it's possible that the big stick may turn into a weak reed.\n\nNot so with China, where the tariff war is on, and China is biting back . US tariffs on China will force supply chains for many Chinese goods to divert to other Asian countries-a boon, for instance, for Vietnam. China's tariffs will hit American farmers , who sell a large share of their wheat, corn, rice and meat to China. Both sides will adjust. A key consequence may be in the markets for high-end chips and software, as the US moves to restrict or shut down Chinese apps like TikTok, DeepSeek and WeChat, not to mention RedNote. Is this, perchance, the agenda of formerly free-trading oligarchs in the tech sector, suddenly faced with superior competition in their niche?\n\nWe do not yet know where Trump's tariffs will settle; a general high-tariff regime is possible. What would it bring? Higher prices for American consumers, and higher profits for businesses protected by tariff walls. Will it bring back jobs and production to American shores? Probably not. Monopoly power usually brings lower output at higher prices; there is no automatic path from higher profits to competitiveness. If the government wants more (and better) production, it needs extra tools: mandatory investment directives, excess profits taxes, credit allocation and price controls, public purchase and ownership of new factories-and above all competent public supervision of private performance. That is how it was done in the New Deal and in the mobilization for World War II-creating the era of American dominance to which Trump would like to return.\n\nTrump's energy policy is \"drill, baby, drill.\" Here the US does have a big cost advantage, especially in natural gas, over most of the world. Let's also admit that subsidies for renewable energy and electric cars were oversold. And let's overlook the environmental consequences, for a moment. Will Trump deliver a new age of cheap and abundant fossil fuels? Apart from geology itself, drilling depends much less on deregulation than on price. So far, under Trump, the oil price is falling, and so is drilling , which peaked back in 2023. Cheap is possible; cheap and abundant, to fuel an industrial revival? We'll see.\n\nTrump's military program appears twofold: to boom US arms exports to Europe , while reorienting the Pentagon toward Asia and missile defense . Sales of overpriced kit to the Europeans would help the big military contractors and permit the US military to shift missions-toward a world-ending war with China that, let's hope, never happens. Saddling Europe with financial and manpower responsibility for confrontation with Russia would be a disaster for Europe -but one can see how it fits into a US calculus in economic and military terms. A major reset of the US military is long overdue-the bases, ships, and aircraft are all obsolete and would not withstand serious combat. But so far, it appears, Trump appears content to waste real resources on a military whose power is, to a large degree, illusory. This, too, is an obstacle to the economic transformation he purports to seek.\n\nMigration figures large in Trump's rhetoric but only trivially in his economics. At the present pace of deportations (about a thousand per day) a shortage of labor in the low-end services migrants presently perform is unlikely, although fear may keep many away from their present jobs. Even so, American wages will not be restored by a mere shortage of undocumented workers.\n\nJeet Heer\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nBooks & the Arts / Brett Christophers\n\nUncertainty and chaos are the final factors in Trump's operation. The winners, broadly, will be financial speculators with fast fingers and (especially) inside knowledge. Those in position to move quickly in and out of stocks, bonds and real estate-and perhaps even in and out of the dollar from a base in crypto -could be the biggest winners. The apex financial and tech predators, already at Trump's feeding trough, could end up in control of the whole economy. Which may be their goal. Well, no surprise-it's an oligarch's world, is it not?\n\nAnd what do the oligarchs want? Like all feudal lords, they want untrammeled power and insecure, obedient serfs-and for this, the vast social services operation that is the US federal government must be cut back, along with the professional classes who form the modern core of the Democratic Party. The words of Andrew Mellon (as recalled by Herbert Hoover) come to mind: \"Liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate the farmers, liquidate real estate. Purge the rottenness out of the system.... enterprising people will pick up the wrecks from less competent people.\" The problem the oligarchs face, and possibly do not understand, is that they cannot do this, any more now than then, without bringing the economy to ruin-from which recovery will be possible only with the competent government they are now working to destroy.\n\nWill they push that far? For now the budget deficit remains high (about 6 percent of GDP), and this supports economic activity. Firing federal employees saves little money in the large scheme of the economy. Apart from severe Medicaid cuts, there is little in Trump's cost-cutting plans that could reduce deficits by much-a good thing, as that would drive GDP down.\n\nOn the other hand, the Federal Reserve is keeping interest rates up-a bad thing that could be bringing on a recession even now, but given the Fed's failure to slow the economy over three years, it's hard to be sure. The stock market is skittish, to say the least. The New York Times has caught wind of a slowdown and naturally blames Trump -in mainstream journalism, economics and witchcraft are easily confused.\n\nApart from interest rates, perhaps the largest risk is the simple fact that the expansion is getting old. Some shock-a stock crash, a financial crisis, a new war, or a new pandemic-could occur at any time. But a general slowdown in business and household spending, not specifically Trump's fault but aggravated by the chaos and uncertainty in Washington, may be the biggest single threat right now. If that happens, Trump's reaction will tell us just how much pain his team is prepared to allow.\n\nOver the longer term, it is hard for an old progressive, who fought against the forces of deindustrialization and financialization when they took control under Reagan in the early 1980s, not to sympathize with the stated vision of the old man now in charge. But it is one thing to yearn for a vanished past of superior American engineering, industrial strength and technological prowess-and quite another to create the conditions for revival. Handing the economy over to libertarians, monopolists, speculators, and rich reactionaries with big egos will not make America great again.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

(AP Photo / Ross D. Franklin)\n\n\" Low-energy Jeb .\" \" Little Marco .\" \" Lyin' Ted .\" \" Crooked Hillary .\" Give Donald Trump credit. He has a memorable way with insults. His have a way of etching themselves on the brain. And they've garnered media coverage, analysis, and commentary almost beyond imagining. Memorable as they might be, however, they won't be what last of Trump's 2016 election run. That's surely reserved for a single slogan that will sum up his candidacy when it's all over (no matter how it ends). He arrived with it on that Trump Tower escalator in the first moments of his campaign and it now headlines his website, where it's also emblazoned on an array of products from hats to t-shirts . This article originally appeared at TomDispatch.com . To stay on top of important articles like these, sign up to receive the latest updates from TomDispatch.com. You already know which line I mean: \"Make America Great Again!\" With that exclamation point ensuring that you won't miss the hyperbolic, Trumpian nature of its promise to return the country to its former glory days. In it lies the essence of his campaign, of what he's promising his followers and Americans generally-and yet, strangely enough, of all his lines, it's the one most taken for granted, the one that's been given the least thought and analysis. And that's a shame, because it represents something new in our American age. The problem, I suspect, is that what first catches the eye is the phrase \"Make America Great\" and then, of course, the exclamation point, while the single most important word in the slogan, historically speaking, is barely noted: \"again.\" With that \"again,\" Donald Trump crossed a line in American politics that, until his escalator moment, represented a kind of psychological taboo for politicians of any stripe, of either party, including presidents and potential candidates for that position. He is the first American leader or potential leader of recent times not to feel the need or obligation to insist that the United States, the \"sole\" superpower of Planet Earth, is an \"exceptional\" nation, an \"indispensable\" country, or even in an unqualified sense a \"great\" one. His claim is the opposite. That, at present, America is anything but exceptional, indispensable, or great, though he alone could make it \"great again.\" In that claim lies a curiosity that, in a court of law, might be considered an admission of guilt. Yes, it says, if one man is allowed to enter the White House in January 2017, this could be a different country, but-and in this lies the originality of the slogan-it is not great now, and in that admission-that-hasn't-been-seen-as-an-admission lies something new on the American landscape. Donald Trump, in other words, is the first person to run openly and without apology on a platform of American decline. Think about that for a moment. \"Make America Great Again!\" is indeed an admission in the form of a boast. As he tells his audiences repeatedly, America, the formerly great, is today a punching bag for China, Mexico... well, you know the pitch. You don't have to agree with him on the specifics. What's interesting is the overall vision of a country lacking in its former greatness. Perhaps a little history of American greatness and presidents (as well as presidential candidates) is in order here.

Books & the Arts / Brett Christophers This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal \"City Upon a Hill\" Once upon a time, in a distant America, the words \"greatest,\" \"exceptional,\" and \"indispensable\" weren't even part of the political vocabulary. American presidents didn't bother to claim any of them for this country, largely because American wealth and global preeminence were so indisputable. We're talking about the 1950s and early 1960s, the post-World War II and pre-Vietnam \"golden\" years of American power. Despite a certain hysteria about the supposed dangers of domestic communists, few Americans then doubted the singularly unchallengeable power and greatness of the country. It was such a given, in fact, that it was simply too self-evident for presidents to cite, hail, or praise. So if you look, for instance, at the speeches of John F. Kennedy, you won't find them littered with exceptionals, indispensables, or their equivalents. In a pre-inaugural speech he gave in January 1961 on the kind of government he planned to bring to Washington, for instance, he did cite the birth of a \"great republic,\" the United States, and quoted Puritan John Winthrop on the desirability of creating a country that would be \"a city upon a hill\" to the rest of the world, with all of humanity's eyes upon us. In his inaugural address (\"Ask not what your country can do for you...\"), he invoked a kind of unspoken greatness, saying, \"We shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.\" It was then common to speak of the United States with pride as a \"free nation\" (as opposed to the \"enslaved\" ones of the communist bloc) rather than an exceptional one. His only use of \"great\" was to invoke the US- and Soviet Union-led blocs as \"two great and powerful groups of nations.\" Kennedy could even fall back on a certain modesty in describing the US role in the world (that, in those years, from Guatemala to Iran to Cuba, all too often did not carry over into actual policy), saying in one speech, \"we must face the fact that the United States is neither omnipotent or omniscient-that we are only six percent of the world's population-that we cannot impose our will upon the other 94 percent of mankind-that we cannot right every wrong or reverse each adversity-and that therefore there cannot be an American solution to every world problem.\" In that same speech, he typically spoke of America as \"a great power\"-but not \"the greatest power.\" If you didn't grow up in that era, you may not grasp that none of this in any way implied a lack of national self-esteem. Quite the opposite, it implied a deep and abiding confidence in the overwhelming power and presence of this country, a confidence so unshakeable that there was no need to speak of it. LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS Email If you want a pop cultural equivalent for this, consider America's movie heroes of that time, actors like John Wayne and Gary Cooper , whose Westerns and, in the case of Wayne, war movies, were iconic. What's striking when you look back at them from the present moment is this: while neither of those actors was anything but an imposing figure, they were also remarkably ordinary looking. They were in no way over-muscled, nor were they over-armed in the modern fashion. It was only in the years after the Vietnam War, when the country had absorbed what felt like a grim defeat, been wracked by oppositional movements, riots, and assassinations, when a general sense of loss had swept over the polity, that the over-muscled hero, the exceptional killing machine, made the scene. (Think Rambo .) Consider this, then, if you want a definition of decline: When you have to state openly (and repeatedly) what previously had been too obvious to say, you're heading, as the opinion polls always like to phrase it, in the wrong direction ; in other words, once you have to say it, especially in an overemphatic way, you no longer have it. The Reagan Reboot That note of defensiveness first crept into the American political lexicon with the unlikeliest of politicians: Ronald Reagan, the man who seemed like the least defensive, most genial guy on the planet. On this subject at least, think of him as Trumpian before the advent of The Donald, or at least as the man who (thanks to his ad writers) invented the political use of the word \"again.\" It was, after all, employed in 1984 in the seminal ad of his political run for a second term in office. While that bucolic-looking TV commercial was entitled \"Prouder, Stronger, Better,\" its first line ever so memorably went, \"It's morning again in America.\" (\"Why would we ever want to return to where we were less than four short years ago?\") Think of this as part of a post-Vietnam Reagan reboot, a time when the United States in Rambo-esque fashion was quite literally muscling up and over-arming in a major way. Reagan presided over \" the biggest peacetime defense build-up in history \" against what, referencing Star Wars , he called an \"evil empire\"-the Soviet Union. In those years, he also worked to rid the country of what was then termed \"the Vietnam Syndrome\" in part by rebranding that war a \" noble cause .\" In a time when loss and decline were much on the American brain, he dismissed them both, even as he set the country on a path toward the present moment of 1 percent dysfunction in a country that no longer invests fully in its own infrastructure, whose wages are stagnant , whose poor are a growth industry , whose wealth now flows eternally upward in a political environment awash in the money of the ultra-wealthy, and whose over-armed military continues to pursue a path of endless failure in the Greater Middle East. Reagan, who spoke directly about American declinist thinking in his time-\"Let's reject the nonsense that America is doomed to decline\"-was hardly shy about his superlatives when it came to this country. He didn't hesitate to re-channel classic American rhetoric ranging from Winthop's \" shining city upon a hill \" (perhaps cribbed from Kennedy) in his farewell address to Lincolnesque (\"the last best hope of man on Earth\") invocations like \"here in the heartland of America lives the hope of the world\" or \"in a world wracked by hatred, economic crisis, and political tension, America remains mankind's best hope.\" And yet, in the 1980s, there were still limits to what needed to be said about America. Surveying the planet, you didn't yet have to refer to us as the \"greatest\" country of all or as the planet's sole truly \"exceptional\" country. Think of such repeated superlatives of our own moment as defensive markers on the declinist slope. The now commonplace adjective \"indispensable\" as a stand-in for American greatness globally, for instance, didn't even arrive until Bill Clinton's secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, began using it in 1996. It only became an indispensable part of the rhetorical arsenal of American politicians, from President Obama on down, a decade-plus into the 21st century when the country's eerie dispensability (unless you were a junkie for failed states and regional chaos) became ever more apparent. As for the United States being the planet's \"exceptional\" nation, a phrase that now seems indelibly in the American grain and that no president or presidential candidate has avoided, it's surprising how late that entered the presidential lexicon. As John Gans Jr. wrote in The Atlantic in 2011, Obama has talked more about American exceptionalism than Presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush combined: a search on UC Santa Barbara's exhaustive presidential records library finds that no president from 1981 to today uttered the phrase 'American exceptionalism' except Obama. As U.S. News ' Robert Schlesinger wrote, 'American exceptionalism' is not a traditional part of presidential vocabulary. According to Schlesinger's search of public records, Obama is the only president in 82 years to use the term. And yet in recent years it has become a commonplace of Republicans and Democrats alike. In other words, as the country has become politically shakier, the rhetoric about its greatness has only escalated in an American version of \"the lady doth protest too much.\" Such descriptors have become the political equivalent of litmus tests: You couldn't be president or much of anything else without eternally testifying to your unwavering belief in American greatness. This, of course, is the line that Trump crossed in a curiously unnoticed fashion in this election campaign. He did so by initially upping the rhetorical ante, adding that exclamation point (which even Reagan avoided). Yet in the process of being more patriotically correct than thou, he somehow also waded straight into American decline so bluntly that his own audience could hardly miss it (even if his critics did). Think of it as an irony, if you wish, but the ultimate American narcissist, in promoting his own rise, has also openly promoted a version of decline and fall to striking numbers of Americans. For his followers, a major political figure has quit with the defensive BS and started saying it the way it is. Of course, don't furl the flag or shut down those offshore accounts or start writing the complete history of American decline quite yet. After all, the United States still looms \"lone\" on an ever more chaotic planet. Its wealth remains stunning, its economic clout something to behold, its tycoons the envy of the Earth, and its military beyond compare when it comes to how much and how destructively, even if not how successfully . Still, make no mistake about it, Donald Trump is a harbinger , however bizarre, of a new American century in which this country will indeed no longer be (with a bow to Muhammad Ali) \"the Greatest\" or, for all but a shrinking crew, exceptional. So mark your calendars: 2016 is the official year the United States first went public as a declinist power and for that you can thank Donald-or rather Donald!-Trump.\n\nThis article originally appeared at TomDispatch.com .

In those years, he also worked to rid the country of what was then termed \"the Vietnam Syndrome\" in part by rebranding that war a \" noble cause .\" In a time when loss and decline were much on the American brain, he dismissed them both, even as he set the country on a path toward the present moment of 1 percent dysfunction in a country that no longer invests fully in its own infrastructure, whose wages are stagnant , whose poor are a growth industry , whose wealth now flows eternally upward in a political environment awash in the money of the ultra-wealthy, and whose over-armed military continues to pursue a path of endless failure in the Greater Middle East. Reagan, who spoke directly about American declinist thinking in his time-\"Let's reject the nonsense that America is doomed to decline\"-was hardly shy about his superlatives when it came to this country. He didn't hesitate to re-channel classic American rhetoric ranging from Winthop's \" shining city upon a hill \" (perhaps cribbed from Kennedy) in his farewell address to Lincolnesque (\"the last best hope of man on Earth\") invocations like \"here in the heartland of America lives the hope of the world\" or \"in a world wracked by hatred, economic crisis, and political tension, America remains mankind's best hope.\" And yet, in the 1980s, there were still limits to what needed to be said about America. Surveying the planet, you didn't yet have to refer to us as the \"greatest\" country of all or as the planet's sole truly \"exceptional\" country. Think of such repeated superlatives of our own moment as defensive markers on the declinist slope. The now commonplace adjective \"indispensable\" as a stand-in for American greatness globally, for instance, didn't even arrive until Bill Clinton's secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, began using it in 1996. It only became an indispensable part of the rhetorical arsenal of American politicians, from President Obama on down, a decade-plus into the 21st century when the country's eerie dispensability (unless you were a junkie for failed states and regional chaos) became ever more apparent. As for the United States being the planet's \"exceptional\" nation, a phrase that now seems indelibly in the American grain and that no president or presidential candidate has avoided, it's surprising how late that entered the presidential lexicon. As John Gans Jr. wrote in The Atlantic in 2011, Obama has talked more about American exceptionalism than Presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush combined: a search on UC Santa Barbara's exhaustive presidential records library finds that no president from 1981 to today uttered the phrase 'American exceptionalism' except Obama. As U.S. News ' Robert Schlesinger wrote, 'American exceptionalism' is not a traditional part of presidential vocabulary. According to Schlesinger's search of public records, Obama is the only president in 82 years to use the term. And yet in recent years it has become a commonplace of Republicans and Democrats alike. In other words, as the country has become politically shakier, the rhetoric about its greatness has only escalated in an American version of \"the lady doth protest too much.\" Such descriptors have become the political equivalent of litmus tests: You couldn't be president or much of anything else without eternally testifying to your unwavering belief in American greatness. This, of course, is the line that Trump crossed in a curiously unnoticed fashion in this election campaign. He did so by initially upping the rhetorical ante, adding that exclamation point (which even Reagan avoided). Yet in the process of being more patriotically correct than thou, he somehow also waded straight into American decline so bluntly that his own audience could hardly miss it (even if his critics did). Think of it as an irony, if you wish, but the ultimate American narcissist, in promoting his own rise, has also openly promoted a version of decline and fall to striking numbers of Americans. For his followers, a major political figure has quit with the defensive BS and started saying it the way it is. Of course, don't furl the flag or shut down those offshore accounts or start writing the complete history of American decline quite yet. After all, the United States still looms \"lone\" on an ever more chaotic planet. Its wealth remains stunning, its economic clout something to behold, its tycoons the envy of the Earth, and its military beyond compare when it comes to how much and how destructively, even if not how successfully . Still, make no mistake about it, Donald Trump is a harbinger , however bizarre, of a new American century in which this country will indeed no longer be (with a bow to Muhammad Ali) \"the Greatest\" or, for all but a shrinking crew, exceptional. So mark your calendars: 2016 is the official year the United States first went public as a declinist power and for that you can thank Donald-or rather Donald!-Trump.\n\nWith that \"again,\" Donald Trump crossed a line in American politics that, until his escalator moment, represented a kind of psychological taboo for politicians of any stripe, of either party, including presidents and potential candidates for that position. He is the first American leader or potential leader of recent times not to feel the need or obligation to insist that the United States, the \"sole\" superpower of Planet Earth, is an \"exceptional\" nation, an \"indispensable\" country, or even in an unqualified sense a \"great\" one. His claim is the opposite. That, at present, America is anything but exceptional, indispensable, or great, though he alone could make it \"great again.\" In that claim lies a curiosity that, in a court of law, might be considered an admission of guilt. Yes, it says, if one man is allowed to enter the White House in January 2017, this could be a different country, but-and in this lies the originality of the slogan-it is not great now, and in that admission-that-hasn't-been-seen-as-an-admission lies something new on the American landscape. Donald Trump, in other words, is the first person to run openly and without apology on a platform of American decline. Think about that for a moment. \"Make America Great Again!\" is indeed an admission in the form of a boast. As he tells his audiences repeatedly, America, the formerly great, is today a punching bag for China, Mexico... well, you know the pitch. You don't have to agree with him on the specifics. What's interesting is the overall vision of a country lacking in its former greatness. Perhaps a little history of American greatness and presidents (as well as presidential candidates) is in order here.

American presidents didn't bother to claim any of them for this country, largely because American wealth and global preeminence were so indisputable. We're talking about the 1950s and early 1960s, the post-World War II and pre-Vietnam \"golden\" years of American power. Despite a certain hysteria about the supposed dangers of domestic communists, few Americans then doubted the singularly unchallengeable power and greatness of the country. It was such a given, in fact, that it was simply too self-evident for presidents to cite, hail, or praise. So if you look, for instance, at the speeches of John F. Kennedy, you won't find them littered with exceptionals, indispensables, or their equivalents. In a pre-inaugural speech he gave in January 1961 on the kind of government he planned to bring to Washington, for instance, he did cite the birth of a \"great republic,\" the United States, and quoted Puritan John Winthrop on the desirability of creating a country that would be \"a city upon a hill\" to the rest of the world, with all of humanity's eyes upon us. In his inaugural address (\"Ask not what your country can do for you...\"), he invoked a kind of unspoken greatness, saying, \"We shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.\" It was then common to speak of the United States with pride as a \"free nation\" (as opposed to the \"enslaved\" ones of the communist bloc) rather than an exceptional one. His only use of \"great\" was to invoke the US- and Soviet Union-led blocs as \"two great and powerful groups of nations.\" Kennedy could even fall back on a certain modesty in describing the US role in the world (that, in those years, from Guatemala to Iran to Cuba, all too often did not carry over into actual policy), saying in one speech, \"we must face the fact that the United States is neither omnipotent or omniscient-that we are only six percent of the world's population-that we cannot impose our will upon the other 94 percent of mankind-that we cannot right every wrong or reverse each adversity-and that therefore there cannot be an American solution to every world problem.\" In that same speech, he typically spoke of America as \"a great power\"-but not \"the greatest power.\" If you didn't grow up in that era, you may not grasp that none of this in any way implied a lack of national self-esteem. Quite the opposite, it implied a deep and abiding confidence in the overwhelming power and presence of this country, a confidence so unshakeable that there was no need to speak of it. LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS Email If you want a pop cultural equivalent for this, consider America's movie heroes of that time, actors like John Wayne and Gary Cooper , whose Westerns and, in the case of Wayne, war movies, were iconic. What's striking when you look back at them from the present moment is this: while neither of those actors was anything but an imposing figure, they were also remarkably ordinary looking. They were in no way over-muscled, nor were they over-armed in the modern fashion. It was only in the years after the Vietnam War, when the country had absorbed what felt like a grim defeat, been wracked by oppositional movements, riots, and assassinations, when a general sense of loss had swept over the polity, that the over-muscled hero, the exceptional killing machine, made the scene. (Think Rambo .) Consider this, then, if you want a definition of decline: When you have to state openly (and repeatedly) what previously had been too obvious to say, you're heading, as the opinion polls always like to phrase it, in the wrong direction ; in other words, once you have to say it, especially in an overemphatic way, you no longer have it. The Reagan Reboot That note of defensiveness first crept into the American political lexicon with the unlikeliest of politicians: Ronald Reagan, the man who seemed like the least defensive, most genial guy on the planet. On this subject at least, think of him as Trumpian before the advent of The Donald, or at least as the man who (thanks to his ad writers) invented the political use of the word \"again.\" It was, after all, employed in 1984 in the seminal ad of his political run for a second term in office.

While that bucolic-looking TV commercial was entitled \"Prouder, Stronger, Better,\" its first line ever so memorably went, \"It's morning again in America.\" (\"Why would we ever want to return to where we were less than four short years ago?\") Think of this as part of a post-Vietnam Reagan reboot, a time when the United States in Rambo-esque fashion was quite literally muscling up and over-arming in a major way. Reagan presided over \" the biggest peacetime defense build-up in history \" against what, referencing Star Wars , he called an \"evil empire\"-the Soviet Union. In those years, he also worked to rid the country of what was then termed \"the Vietnam Syndrome\" in part by rebranding that war a \" noble cause .\" In a time when loss and decline were much on the American brain, he dismissed them both, even as he set the country on a path toward the present moment of 1 percent dysfunction in a country that no longer invests fully in its own infrastructure, whose wages are stagnant , whose poor are a growth industry , whose wealth now flows eternally upward in a political environment awash in the money of the ultra-wealthy, and whose over-armed military continues to pursue a path of endless failure in the Greater Middle East. Reagan, who spoke directly about American declinist thinking in his time-\"Let's reject the nonsense that America is doomed to decline\"-was hardly shy about his superlatives when it came to this country. He didn't hesitate to re-channel classic American rhetoric ranging from Winthop's \" shining city upon a hill \" (perhaps cribbed from Kennedy) in his farewell address to Lincolnesque (\"the last best hope of man on Earth\") invocations like \"here in the heartland of America lives the hope of the world\" or \"in a world wracked by hatred, economic crisis, and political tension, America remains mankind's best hope.\" And yet, in the 1980s, there were still limits to what needed to be said about America. Surveying the planet, you didn't yet have to refer to us as the \"greatest\" country of all or as the planet's sole truly \"exceptional\" country. Think of such repeated superlatives of our own moment as defensive markers on the declinist slope. The now commonplace adjective \"indispensable\" as a stand-in for American greatness globally, for instance, didn't even arrive until Bill Clinton's secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, began using it in 1996. It only became an indispensable part of the rhetorical arsenal of American politicians, from President Obama on down, a decade-plus into the 21st century when the country's eerie dispensability (unless you were a junkie for failed states and regional chaos) became ever more apparent. As for the United States being the planet's \"exceptional\" nation, a phrase that now seems indelibly in the American grain and that no president or presidential candidate has avoided, it's surprising how late that entered the presidential lexicon. As John Gans Jr. wrote in The Atlantic in 2011, Obama has talked more about American exceptionalism than Presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush combined: a search on UC Santa Barbara's exhaustive presidential records library finds that no president from 1981 to today uttered the phrase 'American exceptionalism' except Obama. As U.S. News ' Robert Schlesinger wrote, 'American exceptionalism' is not a traditional part of presidential vocabulary. According to Schlesinger's search of public records, Obama is the only president in 82 years to use the term. And yet in recent years it has become a commonplace of Republicans and Democrats alike. In other words, as the country has become politically shakier, the rhetoric about its greatness has only escalated in an American version of \"the lady doth protest too much.\" Such descriptors have become the political equivalent of litmus tests: You couldn't be president or much of anything else without eternally testifying to your unwavering belief in American greatness. This, of course, is the line that Trump crossed in a curiously unnoticed fashion in this election campaign. He did so by initially upping the rhetorical ante, adding that exclamation point (which even Reagan avoided). Yet in the process of being more patriotically correct than thou, he somehow also waded straight into American decline so bluntly that his own audience could hardly miss it (even if his critics did). Think of it as an irony, if you wish, but the ultimate American narcissist, in promoting his own rise, has also openly promoted a version of decline and fall to striking numbers of Americans. For his followers, a major political figure has quit with the defensive BS and started saying it the way it is. Of course, don't furl the flag or shut down those offshore accounts or start writing the complete history of American decline quite yet. After all, the United States still looms \"lone\" on an ever more chaotic planet. Its wealth remains stunning, its economic clout something to behold, its tycoons the envy of the Earth, and its military beyond compare when it comes to how much and how destructively, even if not how successfully . Still, make no mistake about it, Donald Trump is a harbinger , however bizarre, of a new American century in which this country will indeed no longer be (with a bow to Muhammad Ali) \"the Greatest\" or, for all but a shrinking crew, exceptional. So mark your calendars: 2016 is the official year the United States first went public as a declinist power and for that you can thank Donald-or rather Donald!-Trump.\n\nJeet Heer\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nBooks & the Arts / Brett Christophers\n\nElie Mystal\n\nJeet Heer\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nBooks & the Arts / Brett Christophers\n\nElie Mystal\n\n\"City Upon a Hill\" Once upon a time, in a distant America, the words \"greatest,\" \"exceptional,\" and \"indispensable\" weren't even part of the political vocabulary. American presidents didn't bother to claim any of them for this country, largely because American wealth and global preeminence were so indisputable. We're talking about the 1950s and early 1960s, the post-World War II and pre-Vietnam \"golden\" years of American power. Despite a certain hysteria about the supposed dangers of domestic communists, few Americans then doubted the singularly unchallengeable power and greatness of the country. It was such a given, in fact, that it was simply too self-evident for presidents to cite, hail, or praise. So if you look, for instance, at the speeches of John F. Kennedy, you won't find them littered with exceptionals, indispensables, or their equivalents. In a pre-inaugural speech he gave in January 1961 on the kind of government he planned to bring to Washington, for instance, he did cite the birth of a \"great republic,\" the United States, and quoted Puritan John Winthrop on the desirability of creating a country that would be \"a city upon a hill\" to the rest of the world, with all of humanity's eyes upon us. In his inaugural address (\"Ask not what your country can do for you...\"), he invoked a kind of unspoken greatness, saying, \"We shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.\" It was then common to speak of the United States with pride as a \"free nation\" (as opposed to the \"enslaved\" ones of the communist bloc) rather than an exceptional one. His only use of \"great\" was to invoke the US- and Soviet Union-led blocs as \"two great and powerful groups of nations.\" Kennedy could even fall back on a certain modesty in describing the US role in the world (that, in those years, from Guatemala to Iran to Cuba, all too often did not carry over into actual policy), saying in one speech, \"we must face the fact that the United States is neither omnipotent or omniscient-that we are only six percent of the world's population-that we cannot impose our will upon the other 94 percent of mankind-that we cannot right every wrong or reverse each adversity-and that therefore there cannot be an American solution to every world problem.\" In that same speech, he typically spoke of America as \"a great power\"-but not \"the greatest power.\" If you didn't grow up in that era, you may not grasp that none of this in any way implied a lack of national self-esteem. Quite the opposite, it implied a deep and abiding confidence in the overwhelming power and presence of this country, a confidence so unshakeable that there was no need to speak of it. LIKE THIS?

What's striking when you look back at them from the present moment is this: while neither of those actors was anything but an imposing figure, they were also remarkably ordinary looking. They were in no way over-muscled, nor were they over-armed in the modern fashion. It was only in the years after the Vietnam War, when the country had absorbed what felt like a grim defeat, been wracked by oppositional movements, riots, and assassinations, when a general sense of loss had swept over the polity, that the over-muscled hero, the exceptional killing machine, made the scene. (Think Rambo .) Consider this, then, if you want a definition of decline: When you have to state openly (and repeatedly) what previously had been too obvious to say, you're heading, as the opinion polls always like to phrase it, in the wrong direction ; in other words, once you have to say it, especially in an overemphatic way, you no longer have it.

So mark your calendars: 2016 is the official year the United States first went public as a declinist power and for that you can thank Donald-or rather Donald!-Trump.\n\nKennedy could even fall back on a certain modesty in describing the US role in the world (that, in those years, from Guatemala to Iran to Cuba, all too often did not carry over into actual policy), saying in one speech, \"we must face the fact that the United States is neither omnipotent or omniscient-that we are only six percent of the world's population-that we cannot impose our will upon the other 94 percent of mankind-that we cannot right every wrong or reverse each adversity-and that therefore there cannot be an American solution to every world problem.\" In that same speech, he typically spoke of America as \"a great power\"-but not \"the greatest power.\" If you didn't grow up in that era, you may not grasp that none of this in any way implied a lack of national self-esteem. Quite the opposite, it implied a deep and abiding confidence in the overwhelming power and presence of this country, a confidence so unshakeable that there was no need to speak of it. LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS Email If you want a pop cultural equivalent for this, consider America's movie heroes of that time, actors like John Wayne and Gary Cooper , whose Westerns and, in the case of Wayne, war movies, were iconic. What's striking when you look back at them from the present moment is this: while neither of those actors was anything but an imposing figure, they were also remarkably ordinary looking. They were in no way over-muscled, nor were they over-armed in the modern fashion. It was only in the years after the Vietnam War, when the country had absorbed what felt like a grim defeat, been wracked by oppositional movements, riots, and assassinations, when a general sense of loss had swept over the polity, that the over-muscled hero, the exceptional killing machine, made the scene. (Think Rambo .) Consider this, then, if you want a definition of decline: When you have to state openly (and repeatedly) what previously had been too obvious to say, you're heading, as the opinion polls always like to phrase it, in the wrong direction ; in other words, once you have to say it, especially in an overemphatic way, you no longer have it. The Reagan Reboot That note of defensiveness first crept into the American political lexicon with the unlikeliest of politicians: Ronald Reagan, the man who seemed like the least defensive, most genial guy on the planet. On this subject at least, think of him as Trumpian before the advent of The Donald, or at least as the man who (thanks to his ad writers) invented the political use of the word \"again.\" It was, after all, employed in 1984 in the seminal ad of his political run for a second term in office. While that bucolic-looking TV commercial was entitled \"Prouder, Stronger, Better,\" its first line ever so memorably went, \"It's morning again in America.\" (\"Why would we ever want to return to where we were less than four short years ago?\") Think of this as part of a post-Vietnam Reagan reboot, a time when the United States in Rambo-esque fashion was quite literally muscling up and over-arming in a major way. Reagan presided over \" the biggest peacetime defense build-up in history \" against what, referencing Star Wars , he called an \"evil empire\"-the Soviet Union. In those years, he also worked to rid the country of what was then termed \"the Vietnam Syndrome\" in part by rebranding that war a \" noble cause .\" In a time when loss and decline were much on the American brain, he dismissed them both, even as he set the country on a path toward the present moment of 1 percent dysfunction in a country that no longer invests fully in its own infrastructure, whose wages are stagnant , whose poor are a growth industry , whose wealth now flows eternally upward in a political environment awash in the money of the ultra-wealthy, and whose over-armed military continues to pursue a path of endless failure in the Greater Middle East. Reagan, who spoke directly about American declinist thinking in his time-\"Let's reject the nonsense that America is doomed to decline\"-was hardly shy about his superlatives when it came to this country. He didn't hesitate to re-channel classic American rhetoric ranging from Winthop's \" shining city upon a hill \" (perhaps cribbed from Kennedy) in his farewell address to Lincolnesque (\"the last best hope of man on Earth\") invocations like \"here in the heartland of America lives the hope of the world\" or \"in a world wracked by hatred, economic crisis, and political tension, America remains mankind's best hope.\" And yet, in the 1980s, there were still limits to what needed to be said about America. Surveying the planet, you didn't yet have to refer to us as the \"greatest\" country of all or as the planet's sole truly \"exceptional\" country. Think of such repeated superlatives of our own moment as defensive markers on the declinist slope. The now commonplace adjective \"indispensable\" as a stand-in for American greatness globally, for instance, didn't even arrive until Bill Clinton's secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, began using it in 1996. It only became an indispensable part of the rhetorical arsenal of American politicians, from President Obama on down, a decade-plus into the 21st century when the country's eerie dispensability (unless you were a junkie for failed states and regional chaos) became ever more apparent. As for the United States being the planet's \"exceptional\" nation, a phrase that now seems indelibly in the American grain and that no president or presidential candidate has avoided, it's surprising how late that entered the presidential lexicon. As John Gans Jr. wrote in The Atlantic in 2011, Obama has talked more about American exceptionalism than Presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush combined: a search on UC Santa Barbara's exhaustive presidential records library finds that no president from 1981 to today uttered the phrase 'American exceptionalism' except Obama. As U.S. News ' Robert Schlesinger wrote, 'American exceptionalism' is not a traditional part of presidential vocabulary. According to Schlesinger's search of public records, Obama is the only president in 82 years to use the term. And yet in recent years it has become a commonplace of Republicans and Democrats alike. In other words, as the country has become politically shakier, the rhetoric about its greatness has only escalated in an American version of \"the lady doth protest too much.\" Such descriptors have become the political equivalent of litmus tests: You couldn't be president or much of anything else without eternally testifying to your unwavering belief in American greatness. This, of course, is the line that Trump crossed in a curiously unnoticed fashion in this election campaign. He did so by initially upping the rhetorical ante, adding that exclamation point (which even Reagan avoided). Yet in the process of being more patriotically correct than thou, he somehow also waded straight into American decline so bluntly that his own audience could hardly miss it (even if his critics did). Think of it as an irony, if you wish, but the ultimate American narcissist, in promoting his own rise, has also openly promoted a version of decline and fall to striking numbers of Americans. For his followers, a major political figure has quit with the defensive BS and started saying it the way it is. Of course, don't furl the flag or shut down those offshore accounts or start writing the complete history of American decline quite yet. After all, the United States still looms \"lone\" on an ever more chaotic planet. Its wealth remains stunning, its economic clout something to behold, its tycoons the envy of the Earth, and its military beyond compare when it comes to how much and how destructively, even if not how successfully .

On this subject at least, think of him as Trumpian before the advent of The Donald, or at least as the man who (thanks to his ad writers) invented the political use of the word \"again.\" It was, after all, employed in 1984 in the seminal ad of his political run for a second term in office. While that bucolic-looking TV commercial was entitled \"Prouder, Stronger, Better,\" its first line ever so memorably went, \"It's morning again in America.\" (\"Why would we ever want to return to where we were less than four short years ago?\") Think of this as part of a post-Vietnam Reagan reboot, a time when the United States in Rambo-esque fashion was quite literally muscling up and over-arming in a major way. Reagan presided over \" the biggest peacetime defense build-up in history \" against what, referencing Star Wars , he called an \"evil empire\"-the Soviet Union. In those years, he also worked to rid the country of what was then termed \"the Vietnam Syndrome\" in part by rebranding that war a \" noble cause .\" In a time when loss and decline were much on the American brain, he dismissed them both, even as he set the country on a path toward the present moment of 1 percent dysfunction in a country that no longer invests fully in its own infrastructure, whose wages are stagnant , whose poor are a growth industry , whose wealth now flows eternally upward in a political environment awash in the money of the ultra-wealthy, and whose over-armed military continues to pursue a path of endless failure in the Greater Middle East. Reagan, who spoke directly about American declinist thinking in his time-\"Let's reject the nonsense that America is doomed to decline\"-was hardly shy about his superlatives when it came to this country. He didn't hesitate to re-channel classic American rhetoric ranging from Winthop's \" shining city upon a hill \" (perhaps cribbed from Kennedy) in his farewell address to Lincolnesque (\"the last best hope of man on Earth\") invocations like \"here in the heartland of America lives the hope of the world\" or \"in a world wracked by hatred, economic crisis, and political tension, America remains mankind's best hope.\" And yet, in the 1980s, there were still limits to what needed to be said about America. Surveying the planet, you didn't yet have to refer to us as the \"greatest\" country of all or as the planet's sole truly \"exceptional\" country. Think of such repeated superlatives of our own moment as defensive markers on the declinist slope. The now commonplace adjective \"indispensable\" as a stand-in for American greatness globally, for instance, didn't even arrive until Bill Clinton's secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, began using it in 1996. It only became an indispensable part of the rhetorical arsenal of American politicians, from President Obama on down, a decade-plus into the 21st century when the country's eerie dispensability (unless you were a junkie for failed states and regional chaos) became ever more apparent. As for the United States being the planet's \"exceptional\" nation, a phrase that now seems indelibly in the American grain and that no president or presidential candidate has avoided, it's surprising how late that entered the presidential lexicon. As John Gans Jr. wrote in The Atlantic in 2011, Obama has talked more about American exceptionalism than Presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush combined: a search on UC Santa Barbara's exhaustive presidential records library finds that no president from 1981 to today uttered the phrase 'American exceptionalism' except Obama. As U.S. News ' Robert Schlesinger wrote, 'American exceptionalism' is not a traditional part of presidential vocabulary. According to Schlesinger's search of public records, Obama is the only president in 82 years to use the term. And yet in recent years it has become a commonplace of Republicans and Democrats alike. In other words, as the country has become politically shakier, the rhetoric about its greatness has only escalated in an American version of \"the lady doth protest too much.\" Such descriptors have become the political equivalent of litmus tests: You couldn't be president or much of anything else without eternally testifying to your unwavering belief in American greatness. This, of course, is the line that Trump crossed in a curiously unnoticed fashion in this election campaign. He did so by initially upping the rhetorical ante, adding that exclamation point (which even Reagan avoided). Yet in the process of being more patriotically correct than thou, he somehow also waded straight into American decline so bluntly that his own audience could hardly miss it (even if his critics did). Think of it as an irony, if you wish, but the ultimate American narcissist, in promoting his own rise, has also openly promoted a version of decline and fall to striking numbers of Americans. For his followers, a major political figure has quit with the defensive BS and started saying it the way it is. Of course, don't furl the flag or shut down those offshore accounts or start writing the complete history of American decline quite yet. After all, the United States still looms \"lone\" on an ever more chaotic planet. Its wealth remains stunning, its economic clout something to behold, its tycoons the envy of the Earth, and its military beyond compare when it comes to how much and how destructively, even if not how successfully .

Activate your online access\n\nBiden wisely passed the torch to someone who can counter the MAGA call.\n\nLike most Americans my age, I still remember exactly what I was doing when I heard the news that John F. Kennedy had been shot. My mother and I were in an elevator at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, where I was being treated for cancer. Although I had no idea at the time (my parents spoke simply of a cyst that had been removed from my neck), I was not expected to survive. The elevator operator, a middle-­aged Black woman who always asked after me, was crying, and when my mother asked what was the matter, she replied, \"They killed the president.\"\n\nAs a 6-year-old, I had a less than perfect grasp of the machinery of our democracy. All I knew about Kennedy was that, like my father, he had two small children. I thought being president was something fathers did, like mowing the lawn or taking out the garbage. So I asked, \"Will they shoot Daddy when he is president?\"\n\nFive years later, when Martin Luther King Jr. was murdered, my teachers were still crying when we returned to school four days later. And I can remember my parents crying when Robert Kennedy was shot.\n\nI was in Maine visiting relatives the day someone tried to assassinate Donald Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania, and my first response was not grief- The Nation is not a Trumpist organ-but fear. Not for the candidate, but for our country, and our politics. The phrase that came irresistibly to mind, at the time and afterward, was Malcolm X's comment that JFK's assassination represented \" the chickens coming home to roost.\"\n\nMao's adage that \"political power grows out of the barrel of a gun\" is of little use in democratic politics, though it may explain part of our country's fetishistic devotion to the Second Amendment. Because in America, what grows out of the barrel of a gun is chaos, and fear, and desperation.\n\nIn the days before Trump was shot, the Democratic Party had been consumed by the question of whether President Biden should step aside. That question has now been settled. On July 21, in an act of patriotism and devotion to duty that should secure his legacy as the most successful single-term president in US history, Joe Biden announced that he would stand down , and speedily endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris. As we went to press, all of Harris's most daunting competitors had followed suit, joining a potential popular front that stretches from the Clintons to Cori Bush and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nYet the shooting-which spared Trump but took the life of Corey Comperatore-has already roiled our politics, burnishing the Republican candidate's sense of impunity and driving some Democrats to despair and defeatism. Like Representative Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Bernie Sanders, we draw a different lesson, namely that the best way to counter the call to Make America Great Again is with a summons to Make America Democratic Again. This means not just the formal democracy of elections-fragile and necessary though that is-but the genuine democracy of a country in which power comes from the mouths of the people; women control their own bodies; workers enjoy security and the fruits of their labor; healthcare, childcare, and higher education are regarded as basic rights; and the food we eat, the air we breathe, and the water we drink are protected by the public, for the public.\n\nThanks in part to her role as the Biden administration's point person on abortion, Harris is a formidable messenger for that summons. But for the millions who have been led-like the mainstream media-to discount the vice president's abilities, Joan Walsh's exclusive profile of Kamala Harris offers a must-read corrective. Equally compelling-and just as essential-are Elie Mystal's anatomy of Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson's emerging jurisprudence, Gabriel Furshong's dispatch from Jon Tester's Senate campaign, Rania Abouzeid's profile of the Palestinian actor and director Mohammad Bakri, and Daniel Judt's radical reenvisioning of workers' education. Oh, and we sent Ethan Iverson to see the Rolling Stones...\n\nAs for our critics, Nawal Arjini reviews Hari Kunzru's new novel, Sarah Chihaya considers Helen Oyeyemi's uncanny fictions, Karrie Jacobs appraises Brooklyn's Dubai, David Klion interrogates John Ganz's argument that it all started in the 1990s, and Aaron Timms samples food TV.

To stay on top of important articles like these, sign up to receive the latest updates from TomDispatch.com .\n\nToday, racism remains a poisonous force in America. Fascism and authoritarianism are on the rise and President Donald Trump is giving voice to such hate, making it state policy and central to his presidential agenda. Recently, he tried to ban birthright citizenship by executive order to limit the number of babies of color born in the United States, though such an act is clearly unconstitutional. Currently, at least two federal judges have blocked Trump's executive orders to redefine birthright citizenship. He has also issued executive orders seeking to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion. He clearly does not want Black, brown, and Asian people to be on an equal footing with whites.\n\nAll his most recent efforts are consistent with his long-standing attempts to limit voting rights for people of color. Trump has voiced the most vicious comments over the years: he says that immigrants are \"poisoning the blood of our country\"; he slammed Haitian migrants for trying to enter the United States by claiming hundreds of thousands of them flowing into the country \"probably have AIDS\"; Haiti, El Salvador, and African lands are \" shithole countries \"; migrants are \" animals \"; and, as he also put it, there has to be \" some form of punishment \" for women who have abortions. Finally, Trump has repeatedly stated his admiration for dictators and strong abusive rulers.\n\nTrump, his enablers in the Republican Party, and his Make America Great Again (MAGA) supporters should really be called Make America White Again (MAWA). He and those groups have generated a blueprint for increasing authoritarianism, racism, and xenophobia. It's crystal clear that this enmity toward Black and Brown people is driven in part by demographic changes in the United States that threaten to place Whites in the minority. On the subject of race, Trump is sensitive only when it comes to discrimination against white people. Recently, he signed an executive order that would protect white South Africans from discrimination and allow them to resettle in the United States.\n\nAs I witness the rise of white supremacy in America (again) and the president's ever-growing list of unconstitutional and illegitimate acts, I remember the segregation and Jim Crow of my youth in the late 1940s, '50s, and '60s. And yet, being a member of the last generation of Black Americans to live under Jim Crow and the culture of racism that accompanied it left me, then, with a certain hope and belief in the future. The history of my generation's efforts to make change lent credence to the idea that all of us have the power to eliminate racism. It's just a question of doing the necessary work.\n\nOn any day of my youth, sitting in our living room in a housing project in Kinston, North Carolina, I could pick up a copy of Jet magazine, Amsterdam News , the Pittsburgh Courier , or Ebony magazine, and the headline would scream something like: \"Another Colored Person Dies on the Highway.\" The reason: a \"whites-only\" hospital wouldn't treat them. This happened with alarming frequency and left me with many visions of Black people bleeding to death on the black tarmac of highways in Alabama, Mississippi, North Carolina, and elsewhere in the South. I imagined loved ones or even myself having an accident and not being able to get treatment because no Black doctors could be located. Mostly, though, I worried about my father because as a professional gambler-his cardplaying was the total source of economic support for our family-he sometimes found himself in remote areas of the Deep South, far from medical facilities that would treat Blacks.\n\nThe most notorious such case occurred in North Carolina when I was 8 years old. On April 1, 1950, Doctor Charles Drew , a Black man who was the internationally famous inventor of the blood bank, was in an auto accident near city of Burlington. The rumor was that Doctor Drew had bled to death because a \"white-only\" hospital wouldn't treat him (though, in fact, he had received a transfusion at an all-white hospital). Black people believed such rumors then because they knew of segregated hospitals that would indeed not treat them. I can still feel the heat of the rage of many Black friends who came to our home and could talk of little else. The fact that segregation was state-sponsored only made such a disregard for human life worse.\n\nSegregation and Jim Crow laws were designed to take from Black people our ability to function as anything but mere appendages of the ruling white society. There were significant attempts to change such laws and locally enforced customs through demonstrations, direct action, litigation, and legislation in the 1950s and 1960s, but they didn't succeed in fully correcting the damage of racism in our society, which, as the Trumpian moment indicates, remains pervasive and unyielding.\n\nBut within the Black community, my family, friends, and many others taught me about life and survival, offering me attention and love. Mr. Peter G. Fuller (and yes, we did use \"mister\" then), a favorite of mine and an older friend of my parents, worked as a farm agent, teaching Black farmers how to grow corn, beets, peas, tobacco, and other produce. He was six feet tall and 66 years old, with a brown complexion, an open, bright-eyed face, bushy eyebrows speckled with grey, and slightly protruding teeth. He walked with a loping gait, always chewing a twig as he worked. When I was with him, he was direct and to the point, talking to me as if I were a grown-up and listening to what I had to say.\n\nLooking back, I still admire Mr. Fuller for his patience. My mother would later tell me that, when I was 6, some adults avoided me because I asked too many questions, but not Mr. Fuller. His wife, Loise, called him \"Peter G\" and he was usually in his garden in the early morning hours just off the road that led to our project. I always knew I could find him there. On the day I have in mind, Mr. Fuller was hitched to a mule that was pulling a plow, the reins on his broad shoulders, his hands on that plow. As he turned over the soil in his large garden, I walked behind him in the space between the plowed rows and asked him questions. He was such a favorite of mine because he had time for children. He never rushed you, listened very closely to your questions, and gave you detailed answers, as in the first talk I remember us having.\n\n\"Mr. Fuller, are you afraid of the mule?\"\n\n\"No,\" he answered smiling, \"this mule is better behaved than most people.\"\n\n\"Mr. Fuller, why don't you say horse?\"\n\n\"Well, Douglas, I believe you call a thing or animal by its rightful name. But that is a good question-a mule is a mule, and a horse is a horse. A mule is part donkey and part horse.\"\n\n\"Really!!\" I exclaimed, this being news to me.\n\n\"That's right, Douglas.\"\n\n\"Mr. Fuller, do you plow with a horse?\"\n\n\"I don't-mules are better work animals than horses.\"\n\n\"Why are you plowing?\"\n\n\"Well, if you want to eat well, it's a good idea.\"\n\n\"You plow to eat?\"\n\n\"Well, you plow so you can turn over the rich soil and plant corn seeds. When the corn grows you eat the corn.\"\n\n\"How did you learn to plow?\"\n\n\"My daddy taught me when I was a boy like you.\" Then he added after a pause, \"It's important to plow to grow stuff, just like school is important to learn things.\"\n\n\"Mr. Fuller, would you teach me how to plow?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course,\" he answered, pulled back on the reins, and shouted, \"Whoa mule! Whoa mule!\" The mule stopped. He then instructed me to stand right behind the plow while he stood behind me. He held the reins in his right hand, lifted me up under his left arm, and placed my hands on the handle of the plow. He made a clicking sound toward the mule and off we went. After a few minutes, the mule slowed down, lifted its tail, and grunted, making a bowel movement. The foul smell hit us in the face. Mr. Fuller and I laughed. He didn't seem to mind the smell of the manure, and when we saw that he was also stepping in it, we stopped to laugh some more.\n\n\"Will it hurt the garden plants?\"\n\n\"No, it will help the plants,\" he answered. \"It's what's called fertilizer. The fertilizer and the nutrients in the soil help the plants to grow. Sometimes we think something is a waste, but it helps us live.\" Mr. Fuller put me down as we talked.\n\n\"How did you learn all this stuff, Mr. Fuller?\" I asked, intrigued and curious.\n\n\"I went to college, but I learned a lot of it from my daddy. College is the place you go to learn things and it is important for colored people.\"\n\nA few years later Mr. Fuller told me he had attended the Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute in Virginia, a school established by white people in 1868 to train Native Americans and Blacks to become teachers and learn trades in agriculture, cabinetmaking, printing, and tailoring. He graduated in agriculture.\n\nOn every visit, after that first talk, Mr. Fuller would make a clicking sound and off we would go to continue plowing until I got tired. Then we'd stop under a shady tree overlooking the garden and discuss what seemed to me like everything in the world. Mr. Fuller always had a lunchbox with a mason jar of water, grapes, an apple, a sandwich, and cake. He always seemed to have food for me, too, and when I asked how come, he responded, \"I just do,\" then adding, \"I thought you might come by to see me.\"\n\nWhen I became more knowledgeable about my place in the world during my teen years, I began to ask Mr. Fuller about his past. Did he remember slavery? \"No,\" he responded with a laugh, \"I am not that old, but my parents were slaves as children-I learned a lot from them, yes, I did.\" He gazed at me intently.\n\nBorn in 1881, in Kinston, North Carolina, he was in his mid-60s when, at 5 and 6 years old, I visited him in his garden plot. So, although he spoke to me of many things, he did not disclose parts of his story that I imagine he thought might frighten me. He left out, in fact, certain fearful, seminal events of his youth that I now know occurred in the nearby city of Wilmington, North Carolina, before he reached the age of 20.\n\nWilmington is a mere 87 miles from Kinston. On November 10, 1898, a mob of 1,500 white supremacists marched into the Black section of town, burned down the Black newspaper office building, and killed up to 100 Black people.\n\nWhite-supremacist-directed violence was increasing there for two significant reasons then: growing Black political power and editorials written by Alex Manly for the local Black newspaper, The Daily Record , condemning miscegenation laws. Manly was on the list of Blacks to be killed that day. However, he had been warned and so escaped a few days prior to the mob violence. Manly had written that it was no worse for a Black man to be intimate with a white woman than for a white man to be intimate with a Black woman. In reaction, the white racist community distributed his editorial widely and used it as a pretext for the mass killing of Blacks that followed.\n\nElie Mystal\n\nJeet Heer\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nMr. Fuller was 17 at the time of those murders. Living in Kinston, he couldn't have escaped the fear and tension. If you were Black and so close to atrocities committed by whites, fear traveled and spread fast.\n\nMr. Fuller was born a few years after Reconstruction (1865-77), the period following the Civil War during which the United States sought to reintegrate the Southern states into the union and deal with the status of Black people. It was also a time when white-supremacist groups like the Ku Klux Klan and White Citizens Councils used extreme violence against Black people to keep them from becoming full citizens, a time when an estimated more than 2,000 Blacks were lynched, the ultimate form of terror.\n\nLike my grandparents during their young adult years, Mr. Fuller, inspired by the lives of Frederick Douglass , Harriet Tubman , and others, began to see glimmers of hope in the views of W.E.B. Du Bois, Marcus Garvey, Carter G. Woodson, the poetry of Paul Lawrence Dunbar, and the exhortations of Ida B. Wells and Mary McLeod Bethune. Activists of that era were developing ideas about community, education, organizing, survival, and being responsible for others that would bode well for future Black generations. The accomplishments of Blacks of that era fed the development of much that was to come in politics, education, and the arts, and remain part of a centuries-long struggle to move this country toward the sort of authentic democracy that Donald Trump stands strongly against.\n\nAs I grew in years and understanding, my memories of talking with Mr. Fuller enabled me to feel far more deeply my closeness to my ancestors and the horrors of slavery that they endured. Donald Trump's most recent acts and his unending attacks on \"diversity\" have only brought such conversations back ever more strongly.\n\nI was born in 1942, only 77 years after the 13th Amendment formally abolished slavery. The recentness of slavery, my unbroken connection to enslaved people through my heritage, being a member of the last generation of Blacks to live and grow to adulthood under segregation and Jim Crow all created in me a feeling of responsibility to the past and to the future. Along with my family, Mr. Fuller was the central person who sparked my dedication to my ancestors and to learning about our collective past.\n\nNow, the xenophobic, bigoted, and cruel policies of the Trump administration are bringing back traumatic memories of American racism and all the nightmares that went with it. Yet the words of the Rev. Martin Luther King-\" the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice \"-continue to inspire me during such dangerous, increasingly dismal times.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts.

None.\n\nDonald Trump at the Republican National Convention on July 21, 2016, in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nThis article originally appeared at TomDispatch.com . To stay on top of important articles like these, sign up to receive the latest updates from TomDispatch.com .\n\nFormer president Donald Trump often finds himself on the defensive against accusations of racism. He regularly denies the charges, distorting his record and resorting to his \"Black friends\" defense, while attempting to throw the allegations back at liberals. However, he never explains why he is the favorite son of the one group in society about whose racial bigotry there can be no debate: avowed racists.\n\nSince Trump emerged as a public political figure, they have been resolute in their loyalty to him. Are Trump's African American allies like Senator Tim Scott or Representative Byron Donalds, or Latino ones like Senator Marco Rubio, truly ignorant of his unapologetically racist champions? Or is their blind ambition to share a ticket with him (or be close to power) simply more important to them?\n\nIn 2016, when Donald Trump first ran for president, just about every self-declared white nationalist, white supremacist, Klansman, neo-Nazi, and fascist in the country supported his candidacy. And that's no exaggeration.\n\nOne of the longest-running white nationalist journals in the United States, American Renaissance , is edited by notorious racist Jared Taylor. In January 2016, during the primary race in Iowa, he circulated a robocall that stated, \"I urge you to vote for Donald Trump because he is the one candidate who points out that we should accept immigrants who are good for America. We don't need Muslims. We need smart, well-educated White people who will assimilate to our culture. Vote Trump.\"\n\nTrump was also cheered on by the Ku Klux Klan's official newspaper, The Crusader , which calls itself the \"Political Voice of White Christian America.\" Though it said that it wasn't necessarily endorsing Trump, its urge to ally with him was all too clear. Under the front-page headline banner \"Make America Great Again,\" Pastor Thomas Robb wrote , \"While Trump wants to make America great again, we have to ask ourselves, 'What made America great in the first place?' The short answer to that is simple. America was great not because of what our forefathers did-but because of who our forefathers were.... America was founded as a White Christian Republic. And as a White Christian Republic it became great.\"\n\nAnd then there was the David Duke crisis. On February 24, 2016, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard Duke stated to his white radio audience, \"Voting against Donald Trump at this point is really treason to your heritage.\" When Trump was later asked on CNN about his support from the then-most-famous racist in the nation, his reply was, \"Well, just so you understand, I don't know anything about David Duke. OK? I don't know anything about what you're even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists. So, I don't know.\" Not exactly an unequivocal denunciation.\n\nAnd not true in the least. Trump, who claims the best brain and greatest memory on earth, suddenly got amnesia when it came to the way he had spoken out against Duke in 1991 when that figure ran for governor of Louisiana, and, in 2000, when Trump rejected affiliation with the Reform Party in part because of its links to Duke. At the time, he called Duke a \"bigot\" and a \"racist.\"\n\nTrump conveniently forgot that past history of his during that CNN interview, as he clearly calculated the nature of his base and where it overlapped with Duke's. After blaming a faulty earpiece (which, curiously enough, seemed to work fine for the rest of the interview) and evidently fearing swift blowback, Trump rejected Duke's support the next day.\n\nDuke, however, was undeterred and continued to back him in an enthusiastic fashion. After the election, he even tweeted , \"Make no mistake about it, our people played a HUGE role in electing Trump!\"\n\nOther racists celebrated as well. At a gathering in Washington, DC, Richard Spencer, leader of the white supremacist alt-right movement, declared : \"Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory!\" He was speaking to a crowd of nearly 200, many of whom responded with Nazi salutes. You won't be surprised to know that they expressed no confusion about what Trump represented.\n\nIn August 2017, within months of being in office, the \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, produced a clear opportunity for Trump to denounce racists, Neo-Nazis, and Klansmen who marched to the chants of \"White lives matter\" and \"Jews will not replace us.\" Instead, unlike nearly every other elected official on the national scene, Democrat or Republican, he flubbed his response. After a press conference or two, where he equivocated and went off-script to wax admiringly about \"very fine people on both sides,\" he ultimately denounced the far-right racists. However, he pointedly agreed with their demand that generated the march in the first place-their objection to the removal of the statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee from a city park. Trump has decried the dismantling of Lee statues on a number of occasions, including in Charlottesville, where he called it \"sad\" and \"so foolish.\"\n\nIn 2020, after four years in office, he arguably received even stronger and more violent support from his far-right and white nationalist backers. Those years included his anti-(non-white-)immigrant fight to \"build the wall\" on the US-Mexican border, his rejection of immigrants from the \" shithole countries \" of the Global South, the aspersions he cast on Black-dominated cities, and his endless racist statements about Black athletes , elected officials , women , and protesters .\n\nThen, of course, during the 2020 election campaign, far-right extremist groups like the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers, the Three Percenters, the Boogaloo Boys, and others-many with openly racist members in their ranks-rallied around Trump and became his frontline soldiers after he lost. He famously told the Proud Boys to \"stand back and stand by,\" but not to stand down. They showed up at most \"Stop the Steal\" events and were front and center during the January 6 insurrection , where Black police officers reported being called the \"n-word.\" Trump now refers to that same crew as \" warriors \" and \" patriots ,\" ignoring the Confederate flags, antisemitic symbols, racial slurs, and nooses that were ubiquitous that day.\n\nIn 2020, some in the racist community were smarter in signaling their support for Trump without formally endorsing him. David Duke , however, once again unabashedly came out for him, while suggesting that disgraced media propagandist and ex-Fox News host Tucker Carlson be added to the ticket as his vice-presidential choice. Carlson seemed like a particularly sensible possibility to Duke because, even while at Fox, he had been a proponent of the \"white replacement theory,\" the argument that undocumented (and even documented) immigrants of color are part of a larger conspiracy by unidentified liberals and Democrats to supplant white Americans and white American culture with something distinctly (and all too literally) darker and more disturbing. Of course, Trump subscribed to that thesis as well.\n\nJeet Heer\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nBooks & the Arts / Brett Christophers\n\nElie Mystal\n\nIn 2024, there is little doubt whom the nation's racists will once again be backing for president. Only recently, Trump spewed lies and misrepresentations at a-yes!-white-dominated gathering in an obscure Black church in Detroit, while denouncing that city as \"hell\" and \"totally corrupt,\" and describing black communities as dangerous and depressed. He did not, however, repeat for that crowd and representatives of the national media present that day his pledge to address so-called anti-white racism or to make it a priority should he become president again. As he said in a Time magazine interview , \"If you look right now, there's absolutely a bias against white [people] and that's a problem.\" He offered no examples of that \"problem,\" but it fit in squarely with the belief of 58 percent of his supporters that \"racial minorities\" are favored over whites in the United States.\n\nTrump also claims that he is a victim of anti-white racism from \"radical vicious, racist prosecutors\" in Georgia, New York, and Washington, DC. They are going after him, he insists, simply because he's a white man and not because he committed any actual crimes.\n\nTrump will undoubtedly continue to claim again and again, all too disingenuously, that \"I don't have a racist bone in my body,\" but the folks who unabashedly support him to the hilt certainly think otherwise. The Trump campaign faces the awkward and inconvenient truth that he has never lost the full-scale support of the nation's most hardcore racists.\n\nAnd no wonder! No matter how often he pretends to be free of bigotry, his racist worldview manifests itself at every turn. In his recent \"debate\" with President Joe Biden, Trump made his usual hateful statements against immigrants (of color) and added that they are \"taking black jobs now and it could be 18. It could be 19 and even 20 million people. They're taking black jobs and they're taking Hispanic jobs and you haven't seen it yet, but you're going to see something that's going to be the worst in our history.\"\n\nBy \"black jobs\" and \"Hispanic jobs,\" of course, he was referring to his belief that only certain kinds of work define those communities. It should be taken for granted that he wasn't referring to engineers, lawyers, office managers, professors, veterinarians, or any positions of a professional or middle-class nature. He sees Black Americans and Latinos as nothing but the lowest-paid, lowest-status workers in America.\n\nIn fact, Trump never has anything genuinely positive to say about the Black community, which he sees-just to start down a list-as crime-ridden, dirty, and rodent-infested. Nor does he ever identify any of the groups or individuals in such communities who are working on solutions to the issues they face. That doesn't fit the view of the former president and many of his followers that communities of color are linked only to dysfunction, decay, and (implicitly) inferiority.\n\nNaturally, Trump was wrong on all counts. First, there is no evidence (and, of course, Trump didn't present any) that immigrants are taking jobs from Black and Latino Americans. As The Washington Post noted , \"The Black unemployment rate remains near historic lows and wage gains are at all-time highs.\" In fact, the lowest Black employment on record occurred under President Biden when, in April 2023, it fell to 4.8 percent.\n\nIn addition, unlike Trump's implication that Black people only occupy low-level manual labor jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , almost half of all African Americans work in professional, management, or office jobs. That would undoubtedly be a revelation to Trump, since in the dozens of businesses he's started, very few Blacks and Latinos are ever found in high-level or professional positions.\n\nRather than let Trump get away with his endless series of canards on race in America, interviewers should ask him some pointed questions that are simply never asked in Trump-friendly or Trump-fearful media venues. Three come to mind: Why do you continue to receive such wholehearted support from avowed racists? What is the \"anti-white racism\" (or \" anti-white feeling \") that you so often talk about and why do you consider it more of an issue than racial discrimination against communities of color? Why should Black voters in Atlanta, Detroit, Milwaukee, and Philadelphia, among other places, vote for someone who spent weeks after the 2020 election desperately attempting to disqualify their votes?\n\nTrump does not deserve a single Black or Hispanic vote. Nada . None. His ongoing gaslighting about his record and his appeal to extremists and racists should doom him to the lowest Black and Hispanic vote support in the last 100 years in election 2024.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

This makes it difficult for him to handle celebratory holidays like Independence Day, which are normally meant to be joyous and unifying events. In the hands of other politicians, Independence Day can be an occasion for somber reflection or for uplifting messages about national achievements. But for Trump, the joy taken in reflecting on America's success has an emotional potency only if it helps him do what he truly loves: attack his enemies. The need to always be aggressive leads to a shrill and bitter nationalism: a furious boasting that offers no satisfaction and leaves a bad taste in the mouth. This was on full display when Trump spoke at Mount Rushmore on Friday night. Half the speech was spent upholding national heroes like George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and Theodore Roosevelt. But the far more energized half was devoted to lashing out at the contemporary left, who were charged with actively working to undermine America's cultural achievement. Stephen Miller, the hard-right White House adviser known for his hostility to immigration, was reportedly the main writer of the speech. It certainly featured Miller's signature touches of bombast and belligerence, most famously displayed in Trump's inaugural address decrying the era of \"American carnage.\" Calling attention to the faces on Rushmore, Trump said , \"Before these figures were immortalized in stone, they were American giants in full flesh and blood, gallant men whose intrepid deeds unleashed the greatest leap of human advancement the world has ever known. Tonight, I will tell you and, most importantly, the youth of our nation, the true stories of these great, great men.\" Trump added, \"We declare that the United States of America is the most just and exceptional nation ever to exist on Earth.\" More From Jeet Heer A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump April 25, 2025 This President Has Many Puppet Masters April 21, 2025 Shawn Fain for President! April 18, 2025 Trump warned that the achievements of these \"American giants\" were now under threat. \"In our schools, our newsrooms, even our corporate boardrooms, there is a new far-left fascism that demands absolute allegiance,\" the president claimed. \"Make no mistake: this left-wing cultural revolution is designed to overthrow the American Revolution. In so doing, they would destroy the very civilization that rescued billions from poverty, disease, violence, and hunger, and that lifted humanity to new heights of achievement, discovery, and progress.\" Trump returned to this theme in his Fourth of July message on the White House lawn, saying , \"We are now in the process of defeating the radical left, the Marxists, the anarchists, the agitators, the looters, and people who in many instances have absolutely no clue what they are doing.\" Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion The Power and Symbolism of Brazil's Landless Workers' Movement The Power and Symbolism of Brazil's Landless Workers' Movement Feature / Vincent Bevins A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion The Power and Symbolism of Brazil's Landless Workers' Movement The Power and Symbolism of Brazil's Landless Workers' Movement Feature / Vincent Bevins A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer These two speeches underscore that Trump intends to run on culture war for the election. In this, he is hardly an innovator. Trump's language is more divisive than most politicians, lacking any magnanimous gestures hinting at broader shared values. Still, his basic message repeats a formula that Republican presidential candidates have used since at least Richard Nixon: The GOP represents the real America of patriots prepared to face down enemies at home and abroad, while the Democrats are the party of those too soft and cosmopolitan to defend the heartland. Current Issue View our current issue This was the strategy behind Nixon's appeal to the \"silent majority\" who believe in law and order, Reagan's call to \"make America great again\" (which Trump merely parroted), and George H.W. Bush's making hay out of flag-burning. Trump is using a pitch that may not have won every election but has worked more often than not over the past 50 years. It would be wrong to discount the genuine appeal this message has for Trump's solid base of roughly 40 percent of the electorate. With the right set of circumstances dragging down Biden and a favorable Electoral College map, Trump could well use culture war to make this a competitive race-and perhaps even win with a minority of the vote as he did in 2016. But there's good reason to think that culture war won't have the same magic as before. Joe Biden is a difficult figure to caricature as a radical leftist eager to tear down George Washington statues. Biden, for good or ill, is very securely nestled in the political center. Demonizing Biden won't get the base riled up as they were against Hillary Clinton, who had a similar political profile to Biden but also embodied female ambition, which unsettled many gender traditionalists. Biden simply isn't a scary figure in the same way. The bigger problem, though, is that Trump is trying to sell the idea of American exceptionalism just when the nation is experiencing more self-doubt than at any time since Watergate and the loss of the Vietnam War. It's becoming increasingly clear that America's handling of Covid-19, which continues to surge, is far worse than that of any other rich country. This reality is undermining the myth of American exceptionalism far more quickly than any critique by radical historians pointing out the flaws of the founding fathers. The recent cases of police violence have further shaken any simple conviction of national virtue. The Black Lives Matter protests in the wake of the George Floyd killing may be the largest mass movement in American history. It's estimated that between 15 million and 26 million Americans participated in the protests (which were also echoed throughout the world). Never in history have more Americans been willing to take to the streets to challenge the racial status quo. Neither the rising pandemic death toll nor the size of protests indicates a country that is ready to bask in its glory. Recent polls reflect this loss of faith. According to a Yahoo News/You Gov poll , \"while about half of Americans (52 percent) believe America was a shining city on a hill when Reagan gave his final speech as president, most Americans (62 percent) say the country is no longer a beacon and a model for the rest of the nations of the world.\" Interestingly, this diminished belief in America as a role model cuts across party lines. Among Democrats, 42 percent said America was a \"shining city on a hill\" in 1989, but only 11 percent say that is true in 2020. Among Republicans, 77 percent said American had been a \"shining city on a hill\" in 1989, but only 30 percent believe that to be true in 2020. This poll points to perhaps the greatest problem Trump faces in his reelection bid. In 2016, Trump ran as the truth-teller who would speak about problems mainstream politicians ignored. Hillary Clinton enabled Trump to play that role by making herself the defender of the status quo, saying on occasion , \"America is already great.\" This allowed Trump to draw on the inchoate anger shared by many Americans who didn't have much faith in Trump's agenda-or any particular affection for his public persona. America's problems have only gotten worse since 2016. This time, it's Trump who is the incumbent, while the stance he's taking in the culture wars makes him a defender of the status quo. But there's no mileage in being the status quo candidate when a majority of the public thinks the nation is deep trouble.\n\nThe need to always be aggressive leads to a shrill and bitter nationalism: a furious boasting that offers no satisfaction and leaves a bad taste in the mouth.

With the right set of circumstances dragging down Biden and a favorable Electoral College map, Trump could well use culture war to make this a competitive race-and perhaps even win with a minority of the vote as he did in 2016. But there's good reason to think that culture war won't have the same magic as before. Joe Biden is a difficult figure to caricature as a radical leftist eager to tear down George Washington statues. Biden, for good or ill, is very securely nestled in the political center. Demonizing Biden won't get the base riled up as they were against Hillary Clinton, who had a similar political profile to Biden but also embodied female ambition, which unsettled many gender traditionalists. Biden simply isn't a scary figure in the same way. The bigger problem, though, is that Trump is trying to sell the idea of American exceptionalism just when the nation is experiencing more self-doubt than at any time since Watergate and the loss of the Vietnam War. It's becoming increasingly clear that America's handling of Covid-19, which continues to surge, is far worse than that of any other rich country. This reality is undermining the myth of American exceptionalism far more quickly than any critique by radical historians pointing out the flaws of the founding fathers. The recent cases of police violence have further shaken any simple conviction of national virtue. The Black Lives Matter protests in the wake of the George Floyd killing may be the largest mass movement in American history. It's estimated that between 15 million and 26 million Americans participated in the protests (which were also echoed throughout the world). Never in history have more Americans been willing to take to the streets to challenge the racial status quo. Neither the rising pandemic death toll nor the size of protests indicates a country that is ready to bask in its glory. Recent polls reflect this loss of faith. According to a Yahoo News/You Gov poll , \"while about half of Americans (52 percent) believe America was a shining city on a hill when Reagan gave his final speech as president, most Americans (62 percent) say the country is no longer a beacon and a model for the rest of the nations of the world.\" Interestingly, this diminished belief in America as a role model cuts across party lines. Among Democrats, 42 percent said America was a \"shining city on a hill\" in 1989, but only 11 percent say that is true in 2020. Among Republicans, 77 percent said American had been a \"shining city on a hill\" in 1989, but only 30 percent believe that to be true in 2020. This poll points to perhaps the greatest problem Trump faces in his reelection bid. In 2016, Trump ran as the truth-teller who would speak about problems mainstream politicians ignored. Hillary Clinton enabled Trump to play that role by making herself the defender of the status quo, saying on occasion , \"America is already great.\" This allowed Trump to draw on the inchoate anger shared by many Americans who didn't have much faith in Trump's agenda-or any particular affection for his public persona. America's problems have only gotten worse since 2016. This time, it's Trump who is the incumbent, while the stance he's taking in the culture wars makes him a defender of the status quo. But there's no mileage in being the status quo candidate when a majority of the public thinks the nation is deep trouble.\n\nTrump returned to this theme in his Fourth of July message on the White House lawn, saying , \"We are now in the process of defeating the radical left, the Marxists, the anarchists, the agitators, the looters, and people who in many instances have absolutely no clue what they are doing.\" Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion The Power and Symbolism of Brazil's Landless Workers' Movement The Power and Symbolism of Brazil's Landless Workers' Movement Feature / Vincent Bevins A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion The Power and Symbolism of Brazil's Landless Workers' Movement The Power and Symbolism of Brazil's Landless Workers' Movement Feature / Vincent Bevins A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer These two speeches underscore that Trump intends to run on culture war for the election.

All that's certain, it seems, is that it will involve the construction of a menacing wall-with a big, beautiful door-on our side of the Rio Grande. And no Muslims. Certainly, \"Make America Great Again\" is as ludicrous a sentiment as the rhetoric behind it is offensive. But as Michael Moore illustrates in his new documentary, there's a kernel of truth in Trump's basic plaint that we, as a nation, can do better. Indeed, Where to Invade Next ought to be seen as an antidote to Trump's odious buffoonery. Where the GOP preaches intolerance and inhumanity, Moore takes us on a tour of nations that treat their citizens with dignity and respect-free gourmet lunches in a working-class French public school, for example, and readily accessible, state-sponsored access to reproductive-health services in Tunisia. Finnish children reap the benefits of the world's best-performing educational system, while spending fewer hours in class and doing less homework than students anywhere else. I could list more, but you-and your neighbor-should really just see the film. It's not man-on-the-moon stuff, and one of the messages of Where to Invade Next is that so-called \"greatness\" is not the answer to America's problems. Rather, competence is where America's path to rejuvenation and progress lies. We're talking about adequate pay and affordable healthcare. Functional schools and equitable criminal justice. The basics. Moore's ultimate flourish is a bit of rhetorical jiu-jitsu on the conservative chestnut that the United States is the world's \"indispensable nation.\" We're not indispensable because we \"kick ass\" in a tanks-and-carriers sort of way-as Moore explains at the beginning of the film, America has not won a war since 1945. Rather, we're indispensable because we think creatively and generously and flexibly. We're problem solvers. Most of the ideas that Moore seeks to claim for America and bring back for Americans  were actually conceived of and first implemented in the United States, and Moore's international interviewees acknowledge as much. Today's America scoffs at \"the people who brought you the weekend,\" but the European labor organizers Moore talks to certainly don't. They're grateful for prior American efforts to ban child labor and to mandate a 40-hour work week. And they're stunned by our current shabby state of affairs. Where to Invade Next is not as explicitly pro-union as, say, Roger and Me , but the film's themes are consistently and appropriately undergirded by a strong pro-labor endoskeleton. In Italy, Moore lingers on Ducati factory workers as they enjoy their two-hour lunch break, then debriefs a middle-class Italian couple on where they've spent-and where they plan to spend-their yearly allowance of eight weeks' paid vacation time. (They can afford to travel in part because their bosses give them a \"13th month\" of pay every December.) And of course, with typical Moore-ian aplomb, the stylish Italian factory owners manage to simultaneously express cool (but not smug) satisfaction about their system and perplexed befuddlement about ours. It's hard not to feel the same way. In Iceland, Moore notes that, unlike here, that nation prosecuted (with the help of a US prosecutor)-and, in some cases, incarcerated-the bankers responsible for Iceland's 2008 economic collapse. What's more, given the deplorable course on which men steered the ship of state, Iceland has largely given the helm to women and boasts the highest score of any nation on the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Index. They recognized a problem, found a solution, and implemented it. Why can't we? Moore's wonderful conceit is that he's bringing these reforms and innovations back to their nation of origin, back to where they can once again do some good for American citizens. It's not terribly nuanced, but it doesn't have to be. Let's forget about making America great.

Gore, including Volodymyr Zelensky and his olive green T-shirt and the appearance (and reappearance) of the white pantsuit.\n\nThe recent visit by Vice President JD Vance, his wife, Usha, and the national security adviser Michael Waltz to the U.S. military base in Greenland may have been met with a cold shoulder, but it did produce at least one hot item.\n\nThe week before the Vances' arrival, Aannguaq Reimer-Johansen, a consultant at KNI, a trading conglomerate in Greenland, posted a photo on his Facebook page of what looked like a bright red MAGA hat. Only, instead of the usual \"Make America Great Again\" in white letters, Mr. Reimer-Johansen's cap read \"Make America Go Away.\"\n\nIt touched a nerve - and not just locally. The hats ended up on \" The Daily Show \" and \" The View. \" Across social media, the general reaction was \" I want one .\" Tina Brown compared it to \"the French Resistance on ice,\" thus connecting the red cap to the \"bonnets rouges\" of the French Revolution.\n\nIt turns out that the very success of the MAGA hat as a symbol of political allegiance - its instant recognizability, even on the small screens of smartphones - has also made it an effective weapon of the opposition, at least internationally. Parody with a point.\n\nThe Greenland hats come in the wake of a Canadian hat protest that began earlier this year in response to President Trump's threats to make Canada the 51st state. That was when Doug Ford , the premier of Ontario, wore a trucker hat that looked like a \" dark MAGA \" hat, only this one bore the words \"Canada Is Not For Sale.\"\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "Making America Great Again Isn't Just About Money and Power\n\nTrump Administration\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nEconomic View\n\nBy Robert J. Shiller\n\n\"Make America Great Again,\" the slogan of President-elect Donald J. Trump's successful election campaign, has been etched in the national consciousness. But it is hard to know what to make of those vague words.\n\nWe don't have a clear definition of \"great,\" for example, or of the historical moment when, presumably, America was truly great. From an economic standpoint, we can't be talking about national wealth, because the country is wealthier than it has ever been: Real per capita household net worth has reached a record high, as Federal Reserve Board data shows.\n\nBut the distribution of wealth has certainly changed: Inequality has widened significantly. Including the effects of taxes and government transfer payments, real incomes for the bottom half of the population increased only 21 percent from 1980 to 2014. That compares with a 194 percent increase for the richest 1 percent, according to a new study by Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman.\n\nThat's why it makes sense that Mr. Trump's call for a return to greatness resonated especially well among non-college-educated workers in Rust Belt states - people who have been hurt as good jobs in their region disappeared. But forcing employers to restore or maintain jobs isn't reasonable, and creating sustainable new jobs is a complex endeavor.\n\nDifficult as job creation may be, making America great surely entails more than that, and it's worth considering just what we should be trying to accomplish. Fortunately, political leaders and scholars have been thinking about national greatness for a very long time, and the answer clearly goes beyond achieving high levels of wealth.\n\nAdam Smith, perhaps the first true economist, gave some answers in \" An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations .\" That treatise is sometimes thought of as a capitalist bible. It is at least partly about the achieving of greatness through the pursuit of wealth in free markets. But Smith didn't believe that money alone assured national stature. He also wrote disapprovingly of the single-minded impulse to secure wealth, saying it was \"the most universal cause of the corruption of our moral sentiments.\" Instead, he emphasized that decent people should seek real achievement - \"not only praise, but praiseworthiness.\"\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Biden Jr. and former Vice President Kamala Harris looked on. \"From this moment on, America's decline is over.\"\n\nFeeling vindicated by voters after impeachments, indictments and conviction on 34 felony counts, Mr. Trump claimed a personal mandate as well as a political one. \"Many people thought it was impossible for me to stage such a historic political comeback,\" he said. \"But as you see today, here I am. The American people have spoken.\"\n\nIndeed, he saw divine intervention in his restoration to the White House, citing his close call during an assassination attempt this summer when a bullet nicked his ear. \"I felt then, and believe even more so now, that my life was saved for a reason,\" he said. \"I was saved by God to make America great again.\"\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Cuomo mocked President Trump's ubiquitous \"Make America Great Again\" campaign slogan on Wednesday, quickly drawing the ire of Republicans from New York to the White House for saying that America \"was never that great.\"\n\n\"We are not going to make America great again. It was never that great,\" Mr. Cuomo said. \"We have not reached greatness. We will reach greatness when every American is fully engaged.\"\n\nMr. Cuomo made the comment at the end of a 20-minute speech that focused heavily on Mr. Trump. The event was ostensibly a bill-signing ceremony for new penalties for sex trafficking in New York.\n\nThe clip was quickly packaged by Republicans, and Marcus Molinaro, the Republican candidate for governor, said that Mr. Cuomo owed the nation an apology. \"America, with its imperfections, has always been great,\" Mr. Molinaro said.\n\nBy late Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump himself waded in, repeating Mr. Cuomo's \"never that great\" quote, in all-capital letters, and adding, \"Can you believe this is the Governor of the Highest Taxed State in the U.S., Andrew Cuomo, having a total meltdown!\"\n\nMr. Trump had traveled to New York on Monday and mocked the possibility that Mr. Cuomo might run for president in 2020, saying the governor had privately told him he wouldn't run against him. \"Oh, please do it,\" Mr. Trump said.\n\nMr. Cuomo's office did not immediately respond to that allegation but the next day the governor said, \"I don't have any personal political conversations\" with the president.\n\nIn his speech on Wednesday, Mr. Cuomo, who is facing a primary challenge from his Democratic rival, Cynthia Nixon, explained that he saw Mr. Trump's slogan as backward looking.\n\n\"He has it on his hat: 'Make America Great Again.' What does that mean? We're going to go back to a time when America was great. Right? 'Great again.' The whole concept is, it's retrospective,\" Mr. Cuomo said. \"When do you want to go back to, Mr. President? What was the great time that you want to take us back to, when America was great?\"\n\nMr. Cuomo went on to suggest that Mr. Trump wanted to return to a time before gay marriage and the women's equality and environmental protection movements and \"before these new immigrants started to come across the border.\"\n\n\"That's when America was great, in his head,\" Mr. Cuomo told the crowd in Manhattan.\n\nA few hours later, after the backlash, the governor's press secretary, Dani Lever, issued a statement. \"The governor believes America is great,\" Ms. Lever clarified, adding that \"maximum greatness\" was still to be achieved.\n\nThe governor's dislike of \"retrospective\" slogans is relatively new.\n\nWhen he ran for governor in 2010, Mr. Cuomo said in his announcement video, \"Together, we can make New York great again.\"\n\nAn earlier version of this article misquoted Gov. Andrew Cuomo. He said, \"We are not going to make America great again,\" not \"We are not going to make America great, America.\"\n\nWhen we learn of a mistake, we acknowledge it with a correction.

Just Not the Way He Thinks.\n\ntranscript\n\n[boink] Donald Trump thinks he's making America great again like this. [honking] A little bit of this. \"Our nation - \" \"Honey, I'm calling ICE.\" Ugh. And this. [applause] It's a throwback to another era, when things were black and mostly white. Not really our idea of great. \"Make America great again.\" But Trump has achieved something significant, and he deserves credit. But it's the same kind of credit Inspector Gadget deserves for unintentionally solving a crime. [groans] All right, hear me out. During Obama's eight years of competent, scandal-free leadership, democracy was very much a spectator sport. In the 2014 midterm elections, Democrats had so much confidence in Obama, they didn't even bother to show up at the polls, turning out the lowest number of voters in 70 years. \"A goddamn disaster for Democrats. They got destroyed.\" Which just so happened to give Republicans the edge to block Obama's Supreme Court pick, Merrick Garland, in 2016. And now, Trump is forcing us to engage in our democracy like many never have before. For instance, contrast their very different reactions to the most mind boggling, only-in-America dilemma - mass shootings. \"(SINGING) Amazing grace ...\" [applause] I mean, he breaks into a pitch-perfect rendition of \"Amazing Grace.\" You can't get better than that. He insisted Congress take action and ban assault-style weapons and high-capacity magazines. He even signed 23 executive actions. And then, nothing changed. Not a single law or reform was made to address our gun crisis. Was our faith in Obama so profound that we forgot to do something ourselves? Enter 45. \"To help secure our schools and tackle the difficult issue of mental health ... \" Trump, with his total lack of actual solutions on our gun crisis, inspired this. [cheering] After years of nothing, Florida raised the legal age for buying a firearm from 18 to 21 and banned bump stocks. Stock prices soared for sports stores that stopped selling assault-style rifles. Even several gun owners destroyed their own weapons for the cause. Where was this urgency after Orlando? San Bernardino? Aurora? Charleston? Sandy Hook? All right, now, before you start ranting about normalization, let me be clear. I have no delusions about the destructive force of a narcissist for president, for reproductive rights, for public schools, for immigrants, for the planet. However, something important and desperately needed is also happening. Americans are taking a stand. And it's much more than guns. Witnessing a self-admitted sexual assaulter win the presidency pushed us over the edge to finally tackle decades of silence around sexism. \"Allegations by numerous women who say the Hollywood mogul - \" \"Harvey Weinstein in handcuffs.\" \"CBS News has suspended our co-host Charlie Rose - \" And the sea change goes beyond calling out gross men. More women than ever are entering politics - nearly 600 in total for 2018. And we've already seen some early primary wins. Oh, and way more people are supporting organizations that are vital to our democracy, like the more than $86 million donated to the A.C.L.U. in 2017, up from the $5 million they received in online donations in 2016. Planned Parenthood donations skyrocketed, reaching 40 times their normal rate in the week after the election. Even local politics hold our attention and make national news. It's the new norm to track court rulings and be informed. People are actually reading and paying for news. So here's the deal. The Democrats appear to be more fired up about the midterms than Republicans, according to this Pew Research study. But we all know what happens when eggs are counted before they hatch. \"The largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period.\" So don't go back to sleep. Don't let this deluge of news and chaos turn into white noise. Stay in the game. And definitely, please, vote in the midterms this November.\n\n15:37\n\n14:16\n\n17:27\n\n2:28\n\n56:32\n\n1:38:38\n\n4:09\n\n1:09:21\n\n2:13\n\n58:56\n\n12:07\n\n1:03:32\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "Trump's Campaign Hat Becomes an Ironic Summer Accessory\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nBy Ashley Parker\n\nAn old-school, wide-brimmed rope hat - some in white and navy, others in red and white - has seemingly become the ironic must-have fashion accessory of the summer.\n\nIt is the \"Make America Great Again\" campaign hat first worn in July by Donald J. Trump in Laredo, Tex., and since spotted on hipsters from Williamsburg, Brooklyn, to the Silver Lake district of Los Angeles and in the football locker of Tom Brady, not to mention on the heads of the hundreds of Trump loyalists at his rallies.\n\n\"I was certainly surprised to the extent it caught on,\" Mr. Trump said in a phone interview last week. \"It's become the hottest fashion item there is.\"\n\nThe hats, in four different designs, are $25 on the Trump campaign website and in Midtown at the store in the Trump Tower, where they promptly sold out.\n\nThe hats' appeal seems to rest partly in their studied outmodedness (think the 2.0 version of the trucker hats repopularized by millennials) and partly in their uncanny ability to capture the current absurdist political moment, with 17 Republicans vying, circuslike, for their party's nomination.\n\n\"I'm at a loss to describe the ironic charm of the hats,\" said Nu Wexler, a public policy spokesman at Twitter who received one as a gift from a colleague. \"It's a huge hat that looks like something you'd wear at a golf club in South Florida in the '80s.\"\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "Octavia Butler's Prescient Vision of a Zealot Elected to \"Make America Great Again\"\n\nOctavia Butler's tenth novel, \" Parable of the Sower ,\" which was\npublished in 1993, opens in Los Angeles in 2024. Global warming has\nbrought drought and rising seawater. The middle class and working poor\nlive in gated neighborhoods, where they fend off the homeless with guns\nand walls. Fresh water is scarce, as valuable as money. Pharmaceutical\ncompanies have created \"smart drugs,\" which boost mental performance,\nand \"pyro,\" a pill that gives those who take it sexual pleasure from\narson. Fires are common. Police services are expensive, though few\npeople trust the police. Public schools are being privatized, as are\nwhole towns. In this atmosphere, a Presidential candidate named\nChristopher Donner is elected based on his promises to dismantle\ngovernment programs and bring back jobs.\n\n\"Parable of the Sower\" unfolds through the journal entries of its\nprotagonist, a fifteen-year-old black girl named Lauren Oya Olamina, who\nlives with her family in one of the walled neighborhoods. \"People have\nchanged the climate of the world,\" she observes. \"Now they're waiting\nfor the old days to come back.\" She places no hope in Donner, whom she\nviews as \"a symbol of the past to hold onto as we're pushed into the\nfuture.\" Instead, she equips herself to survive in that future. She\npractices her aim with BB guns. She collects maps and books on how\nNative Americans used plants. She develops a belief system of her own, a\nDarwinian religion she names Earthseed. When the day comes for her to\nleave her walled enclave, Lauren walks west to the 101 freeway, joining\na river of the poor that is flooding north. It's a dangerous crossing,\nmade more so by a taboo affliction that Lauren was born with,\n\"hyperempathy,\" which causes her to feel the pain of others.\n\nBy writing black female protagonists into science fiction, and bringing\nher acute appraisal of real-world power structures to bear on the\nimaginary worlds she created, Butler became an early pillar of the\nsubgenre and aesthetic known as Afrofuturism. (Kara Walker cites her as\nan inspiration; and, as Hilton Als has pointed out, Butler is the\n\" dominant artistic force \" in Beyoncé's visual album \"Lemonade.\") In the\nongoing contest over which dystopian classic is most applicable to our\ntime, Kellyanne Conway made a strong case for George Orwell's \"Nineteen\nEighty-Four\" when she used the phrase \"alternative facts\" and sent the\nnovel to the top of Amazon's best-seller list. Margaret Atwood's \"The\nHandmaid's Tale\" also experienced a resurgence in sales, and its TV\nadaptation on Hulu inspired protest costumes. But for sheer peculiar\nprescience, Butler's novel and its sequel may be unmatched.\n\nButler was born in 1947, in Pasadena, California, and raised by her\ngrandmother and mother, who worked as a maid. Her father, a shoe\nshiner, died when she was seven. As a child, she often accompanied her\nmother to work at a wealthy Pasadena household, where the help entered\nthrough back doors. In one of Butler's first stories, \"Flash-Silver\nStar,\" which she wrote at the age of eleven, a young girl is picked up\nby a U.F.O. from Mars and taken on a tour of the solar system.\n\nButler ignored the received idea that black people belonged in science\nfiction only if their blackness was crucial to the plot. (In 1979, a\nfellow-science-fiction writer advised Butler that points about race\nmight better be made with extraterrestrials.) As she wrote in a 1980\nessay for the magazine Transmission , titled \"Lost Races of Science\nFiction\": \"No writer who regards blacks as people, human beings, with\nthe usual variety of human concerns, flaws, skills, hopes, etc., would\nhave trouble creating interesting backgrounds and goals for black\ncharacters.\" She later made a habit of explaining, as here to the Times , \"I wrote myself in, since I'm me and I'm here and I'm\nwriting. I can write my own stories and I can write myself in.\"\n\nIn \"Octavia E. Butler: Telling My Stories,\" an exhibition of Butler's\npapers at the Huntington Library, in San Marino, California, which\nruns through August 7th, there is tangible evidence of her outsize resolve.\nOver the decades, as she was writing her most popular novel, \" Kindred ,\"\nand two highly regarded series-her five-part Patternist books and her\nXenogenesis trilogy-Butler was filling personal journals with affirming\nmantras. \"I am a bestselling writer,\" one entry, dated 1975, reads. \"I\nwrite bestselling books.\" She closes: \"So be it! See to it!\" She was\nstill talking to herself in this manner in 1988, even though by then she\nhad won both a Hugo and a Nebula award, science fiction's highest\nhonors. \"I shall be a bestselling writer,\" she writes in a notebook that\nyear. \"So be it! See to it!\"\n\nBy the time she began working on the Parable books, in 1989, Butler was\nin her forties and had written nine novels. The series, she decided,\nwould be her \"If this goes on...\" story. In colorful diagrams, Butler\nextrapolated her vision of a near-future dystopia from what she read in\nthe news, forecasting what kind of collapse might result if the forces\nof late-stage capitalism, climate change, mass incarceration, big\npharma, gun violence, and the tech industry continued unhampered. (\"More\nHispanics,\" she writes in one notebook. \"More High Tech.\") Butler took a\ncyclical view of history. She also thought social progress was\nreversible. As the public sphere became hollowed out, a fear of change\nwould create an opening for retrograde politics. With collapse, racism\nwould become more overt.\n\nThe sequel, \" Parable of the Talents ,\" published in 1998, begins in 2032.\nBy then, various forms of indentured servitude and slavery are common,\nfacilitated by high-tech slave collars. The oppression of women has\nbecome extreme; those who express their opinion, \"nags,\" might have\ntheir tongues cut out. People are addicted not only to designer drugs\nbut also to \"dream masks,\" which generate virtual fantasies as guided\ndreams, allowing wearers to submerge themselves in simpler, happier\nlives. News comes in the form of disks or \"news bullets,\" which \"purport\nto tell us all we need to know in flashy pictures and quick, witty,\nverbal one-two punches. Twenty-five or thirty words are supposed to be\nenough in a news bullet to explain either a war or an unusual set of\nChristmas lights.\" The Donner Administration has written off science,\nbut a more immediate threat lurks: a violent movement is being whipped\nup by a new Presidential candidate, Andrew Steele Jarret, a Texas\nsenator and religious zealot who is running on a platform to \"make\nAmerican great again.\"\n\nIn Butler's prognosis, humans survive through an intricate logic of\ninterdependence. Soon after leaving her family's walled neighborhood,\nLauren discerns that her natural allies are other people of color,\nincluding mixed-race couples, since they are likely to become targets of\nwhite violence. Several of the migrants who join Lauren's pack and the\ncommunity she later establishes, Acorn, turn out to also be \"sharers,\"\nthe term for people with hyperempathy. But Butler is not making a\nsentimental case for the value of empathy. In the day to day of the\nParable books, hyperempathy is a liability that makes moving through the\nworld more complicated and, for tactical reasons, requires those who\nhave it to behave more ruthlessly. When defending herself against\nattackers, Lauren often must shoot or stab to kill, or else risk being\nimmobilized by the pain she inflicts. In one particularly dark\nmanifestation of the syndrome, she is raped and experiences both her own\npain and the pleasure of her rapist.\n\nIn 1995, Butler became the first science-fiction writer to be awarded a\nMacArthur fellowship. The grant, she hoped, would enable her to finish\nfour more books she had planned for the Parable series. But the story,\nshe found, was \"too depressing.\" She changed course and wrote a vampire\nnovel, her last book, \" Fledgling ,\" which came out in 2005. The following\nyear, Butler died unexpectedly, at the age of fifty-eight, when she fell\nand hit her head outside her home, north of Seattle. In her lifetime,\nButler insisted that the Parable series was not intended as an augur.\n\"This was not a book about prophecy,\" she said, of \"Talents,\" in remarks\nshe delivered at M.I.T. \"This was a cautionary tale, although people\nhave told me it was prophecy. All I have to say to that is: I certainly\nhope not.\"\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "The Spectacle of Donald Trump's R.N.C.\n\nSo much of a Trump rally is waiting in a crowd, anticipating his arrival. All week at the Republican National Convention, Trump was present but silent. He sat and observed the proceedings from his \"Make America Great Once Again\" box. Around the Convention, in Milwaukee, I heard speculation that, since Saturday, when a gunman had attempted to assassinate Trump , he was a changed man, or that maybe the blissful smile on his face was from painkillers he was supposedly taking for his ear injury. Reporters were told that Trump would write his own speech-it's \"really coming from the heart,\" a campaign spokesperson said-which he would deliver on Thursday night. On Wednesday, one of Trump's ten grandchildren spoke to the Convention-a gesture toward the next generation, the suggestion of a robust dynasty.\n\nAt the security perimeter between the R.N.C. and the city of Milwaukee, I watched two groups of Secret Service personnel deciding whether they would have to Tase a woman who was taking her clothes off as she whirled toward the fence. \"It seems like she knows exactly the point where she has to stop,\" one of the officers said. They gave her a bottle of water. Police officers from dozens of states had come to Wisconsin to provide Convention security. They crossed bridges over the Milwaukee River, on horseback and on bicycles and on foot, as a police boat patrolled the water below.\n\nInside the Convention center, I stopped at a table where two men were selling a coffee-table book of Trump's tweets from 2009 to 2019 styled as poetry. Chapter headings included \"Loathings\" and \"Amores\"; \"it has a robust glossary,\" one of the men said. A passerby was looking to buy a Trump-branded Bible, but she signed the man's petition to nominate Trump for Poet Laureate anyway. \"He brings wealth and beauty to the country,\" she said. \"All the Democrats, they look like crap.\" On the Convention floor, a delegate asked me for a piece of paper from my notebook, and then folded the white page into an ersatz ear bandage, in solidarity with Trump. Ear cuffs with American flags and the words \"The day we dodged the bullet\" were becoming the new post-assassination brand.\n\nOn the Convention's final night, I stood next to the Wisconsin delegation, whose members were wearing hats in the shape of cheese. Sitting in his box, Trump held his youngest grandchild on his lap. Onstage, Tucker Carlson told the crowd, \"I have never been to a more fun Convention or a Convention with better vibes.\" Trump, he continued, had become \"the leader of this nation\" since the assassination attempt. His project wasn't just to win but to \"return democracy to the United States.\" A man next to me waved a flag in the air, and told me what a special night it was: \"It's like 1984 again.\"\n\nThe sense in the arena that America already belonged to Trump didn't translate into complacency. I ran into a delegate I'd last seen a few months ago, in Florida, where he told me the election would be won in a landslide; since then, the delegate said he had registered twenty-two hundred nonpartisan voters as Republicans. \"Phone-banking, mail-in voting, targeting voters who didn't vote in the midterms-we went from violet to deep red,\" he told me. He pulled out his phone to show me a news story claiming that Biden, who was sick with COVID at his beach house, was preparing to drop out of the race. Hulk Hogan had just taken the stage. \"Let Trumpomania make America great again!\" he screamed, ripping off his shirt.\n\nWhen Trump finally came onto the stage, from behind a curtain that rose up to reveal him, as if he were in \"Chicago,\" it seemed, at first, that we were meeting the new man I'd heard hinted at all week-vulnerable, misty-eyed, leading with love and gratitude. He began with a long soliloquy describing the assassination attempt, which might have been his best rally story yet. (He said he would only tell it only once, instead of adding it to the repertoire; it would be too painful to tell again.) After a while, though, he picked up essentially where he had left off, right before he was shot, at his rally in Pennsylvania. On the Convention screen behind him, Trump projected a chart tracking illegal immigration that he had been looking at when the shooting started, and launched into an hourlong speech that was nearly indistinguishable from his usual campaign fare.\n\nThroughout the week, on the Convention floor, people held up signs that said \" mass deportation now! ,\" a pastor prayed for protection from tyranny, and speakers railed against the \"lawfare jackals\" of the Democratic Party who wanted to jail them. \"We're actually going to go home and miss it,\" Trump said, of the Convention. \"It's about love.\" After he finished, an opera singer performed \"Nessun Dorma,\" the aria from Puccini's \"Turandot,\" as the former President gazed out on the crowd. Thousands of balloons dropped into the arena, and attendees streamed out, balloons popping under their feet. Trump's final imprint on the Convention was the addition of gold balloons to the traditional red, white, and blue. A delegate next to me, in Trump-brand sneakers, was ready to go. \"It was great, but it was a bit long-winded,\" he said. A local minister took the stage in front of the emptying room to offer a closing benediction. \"Hey, time to pray!\" one attendee shouted. Some stayed a minute longer, and then the staff struck the set.\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Joe Biden's This-Is-Not-Normal Speech on the Rising Danger of MAGA Trumpists\n\nIn a speech on Thursday night, billed as a major address about the \"battle for the soul of the nation,\" Joe Biden said the word \"Trump\" only twice. The current President may not have mentioned his predecessor's name much, but Biden's speech, as is the case with the rest of his Presidency, was all about standing against Trump and the unique threat to American democracy that he and his \"Make America Great Again\" supporters pose.\n\n\"Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic,\" Biden said.\n\nThe Republican Party is \"dominated, driven, and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans,\" he said.\n\n\" MAGA Republicans do not respect the Constitution,\" he said.\n\n\" MAGA forces are determined to take the country backwards,\" he said.\n\nThirteen times, in fact, Biden called out the Trumpists who have seized hold of one of America's two great political parties-in just about the most unsparing terms a President has ever used for political opponents. I guess that Biden, subject of endless laments so recently from Democrats who feared he was reluctant to take on the Trump-captive G.O.P. in strong enough terms, is not afraid of going on the attack anymore.\n\nI suspect that few will remember Biden's words on Thursday night, however, as much as they will think of the ominous setting -the front of Philadelphia's Independence Hall at night, with dramatic red floodlights as the backdrop for the President while he spoke in dire terms about the possibility of political violence from the Trumpists who still refuse to concede Trump's 2020 defeat, and who celebrate the violent mob that stormed the Capitol in hopes of overturning it. Just hours before Biden's speech, in fact, Trump himself bragged of giving financial support to some of the insurrectionists who have been charged by the Justice Department, and told an interviewer that he was considering offering blanket pardons to the January 6th defendants, should he be reëlected in 2024.\n\nMAGA Republicans seemed to think that the scary setting for Biden's alarming message was somehow beneficial to them, and they soon began sharing images of the dramatic black-and-neon-red scene. \"I can't believe this is a real photograph,\" J. D. Vance , the Trump-backed Republican nominee for Senate in Ohio, tweeted . \"It depicts the president of our nation, as he took to the airwaves and spoke about his fellow citizens as if they were sewer rats.\" Rick Scott, the Republican Senate campaign chief, tweeted the photo and dismissed Biden as a \"raving lunatic\" who \"attacked half the country tonight.\" Mike Huckabee , the former governor of Arkansas, called it a \"hate speech.\" Over on Fox News, Tucker Carlson was very, very angry about the \"blood-red Nazi background\" and the Marine honor guard in front of Independence Hall, a setting that he termed a \"complete outrage.\" Even before Biden spoke, Kevin McCarthy -the House Minority Leader, whose slavish devotion earned him the sobriquet \"my Kevin\" from Trump-gave a prebuttal , in which he said that the President should \"apologize for slandering tens of millions of Americans as fascists.\"\n\nIn the inverted logic of Trumpworld, theirs is the grievance that matters. They are always the wronged party. Storming the Capitol and defying the will of the voters in 2020 was totally fine. But how dare Joe Biden say such nasty things about them for doing so? These howls of complaint might have been fun to listen to from the folks who routinely savage Biden as a wild-eyed socialist out to destroy freedom itself, if what they themselves were doing to the country were not so deadly serious.\n\nAs an opening act of the fall campaign season, none of this bodes well. The country is clearly in for another period of electioneering in which playing to the fears of one's supporters will be just about all that matters. Democrats are hoping, against history and most of the evidence , to turn the midterm election, once again, into a referendum on Trump, and, in so doing, to save their control over the Senate and maybe even the House. Nothing unites Democrats more than their hatred of Trump , a subject that they feel more passionate about than their support for Biden ; maybe their fear and loathing toward the man of Mar-a-Lago, along with their outrage over the Supreme Court's decision this summer throwing out Roe v. Wade , will be enough to overcome the odds in November. As for Republicans, they surely would prefer to talk about the country's sour mood, high inflation, and wavering economy under Biden, but they remain hooked on Trump-and Trump was never going to make the election about anything but himself. He won't move on from 2020, so they can't move on from 2020.\n\nIn watching the awkward squirming and instant blame-shifting, it can be easy to forget that this is hardly standard-issue campaign rhetoric-from either side. Presidents do not generally accuse the other party of attempting to eviscerate democracy, of defying the rule of law itself. But nor have they had to. \"You can't love your country only when you win,\" Biden said, which is no longer the self-evident fact about America that it used to be.\n\n\"Too much of what is happening today in our country is not normal,\" Biden said, early in his speech, a statement that was both correct and wildly understated. That longing for \"normal\" is something I have heard often expressed in Washington over these past few Trump-dominated years in American politics, with all the former President's bizarre Oval Office rants and his and his followers' willingness to torch even the most long-standing American traditions.\n\nWhat scares me most about this moment is that I remember hearing this lament before-in Vladimir Putin's Russia . Arriving in Moscow a decade after the collapse of the Soviet Union, I often heard Russians I interviewed complaining about the upending of their world, with the attendant economic and social collapse, in ways that were strikingly similar to the complaints of many Americans today. Where we in the West saw Mikhail Gorbachev as a hero who had helped bring an end to decades of Communist tyranny, all too many Russians agreed with Putin that the collapse of the Soviet Union, which Gorbachev helped bring about, was a \" catastrophe .\" What they wanted, many told me, was to live in a \" normal, civilized country .\"\n\nA few days ago, Gorbachev died , at the age of ninety-one, his dream of Russian democracy having long ago perished. Now even American democracy itself is teetering. How telling it is that, when the President of the United States today speaks of threats to the nation, he is warning not about adversaries abroad but the danger within. \"Normal\" never sounded so good. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Donald Trump's Second Coming\n\nThe Republican Convention's finale on Thursday night began, fittingly, with a clown show: Hulk Hogan, shouting in a voice that sounded like a Disney Animatronic version of a pro wrestler giving a political speech. He talked about the \"real Americans\" in the room, \"the Trumpites who are going to be running wild the next four years,\" and the \"gladiators\" who will lead them back to power-Donald Trump and his new running mate, the Ohio senator J. D. Vance. Then he stripped off his jacket, and ripped off his shirt, to reveal a bright-red Trump-Vance 2024 T-shirt, in honor, he said, of the near-death experience that Trump had suffered less than a week earlier. \"I want the world to know that Donald Trump is a real American hero,\" Hogan said. In the imperial red MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN box, just above the convention floor, Trump stood at attention, wearing his signature navy suit and red tie. At the end of Hogan's performance, Trump-convicted felon, front-running Presidential candidate-pumped his fist in the air, the small white bandage on his right ear a reminder of what were, perhaps, the most unbelievable few days I can ever recall in American politics.\n\nTwo hours later, the wounded showman took the stage. Behind him was a full replica of the White House, lit up in red and blue. The former President had not said a word in public since being shot at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday evening. He gave his account of the would-be assassin's bullet coming within a quarter inch of killing him, of the blood he found on his hand, and how he knew he had survived \"because I had God on my side.\" In the hours leading up to Trump's acceptance speech, his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, one of a passel of ascendant Trump family members in the now fully Trumpified G.O.P., insisted that the \"near-death experience\" had changed the ex-President and that a \" softer version\" of Trump would be presented in his Thursday-evening acceptance speech. Various advisers claimed to Politico that the famously non-religious Trump had absorbed a dose of \" humility, in the Biblical sense ,\" as one put it.\n\nAnd sure enough, Trump uncharacteristically opened with lines about \"the grace of almighty God\" and a \"message of confidence, strength, and hope.\" Instead of the \"American carnage\" that he emphasized in his dark Inaugural Address from 2017, which prefigured a chaotic and divisive four years in the White House, he spoke of healing the discord in society. \"I am running to be President for all America,\" he said, a phrase that he generally avoided when he was actually the President. Did he mean it? Was he having a post-traumatic episode?\n\nOnce the sombre formalities were concluded, a more realistic theme, or at least a Trumpier one, presented itself: his definition of \"unity,\" it turned out, was not so much about healing national discord as it was about making sure that the criminal cases pending against him-those terrible \"partisan witch hunts\"-would be ended. A kinder, gentler Trump? Never mind. The speech showed that there is no such thing, any more than there is a kinder, gentler version of the G.O.P. in 2024. One of my enduring memories of this Convention will be the delegates streaming out of the hall on Wednesday evening, many of them carrying pre-printed \" MASS DEPORTATION NOW \" signs as souvenirs. The biggest applause I heard for anyone other than Trump was for Peter Navarro, the defiant former White House adviser who was imprisoned for refusing to testify to Congress about Trump's effort to overturn the 2020 election. Revenge was the theme of Navarro's speech, delivered hours after his release. \"If we don't control our government, their government will control us,\" he warned, darkly. The crowd did not want uplift; like Navarro, like Trump, what it wanted was retribution.\n\nTrump's supposed pivot to the center was silly spin, and yet all week long I marvelled at the collective susceptibility to this narrative, so seductive, so absurd. It's true that the Republican platform, micromanaged by Trump himself, excised controversial, politically inconvenient positions, whether a national abortion ban that has been atop the Party's agenda for decades or the insistence that marriage be strictly defined as between a man and a woman. This was not a sign of moderation, however; those positions have been deleted but not repudiated. The new platform consists of vague slogans -rendered in all caps out of deference to the leader's eccentric typographical preferences. This, too, is telling. The man himself is the policy, which is the perfect reflection of the authoritarian turn in the Republican Party. This part, at least, they are not bothering to hide. Asked by the Times what message the platform's aggressive rewriting sent, Chris LaCivita, a top Trump campaign adviser, did not pretend it signalled a turn toward the center. \"What it says is that the Republican Party is Donald Trump's party,\" he responded . \"Trump has put the imprint, quite frankly, that he should have had in 2016 and 2020 on the Party as a whole in 2024.\"\n\nSoon enough on Thursday night, the audience was back to its comfort zone, booing as Trump criticized \"crazy Nancy Pelosi\" and warned that the hated Democrats were \"destroying our country,\" cheering him on as he demanded the firing of union leaders and rambled about the \"China virus\" and the \"plunder\" of our nation by rapacious foreigners. The second coming of George Herbert Walker Bush this was not. All the Trump standbys were there: the supposed \"invasion\" at the southern border, the \"caravans\" and the illegal alien crime wave, the 2020 election that was stolen from him by Democrats \"who used COVID to cheat,\" the weakness and incompetence of everyone else. The theme of the speech, of the night, of the campaign, was the same theme of Trump's entire life, summed up in the one word that he had shouted in Pennsylvania on Saturday, before he was carried off the stage, bloodied but intact: \"Fight!\"\n\nWhat can you say about a week when the attempted assassination of the once and quite possibly future President was not necessarily the biggest news? On Monday, less than forty-eight hours after the shooting in Pennsylvania, Trump chose as his Veep-in-waiting a thirty-nine-year-old first-term senator from Ohio who once called Trump \"America's Hitler.\" In writing, no less. In any other political moment, a headline for the ages. By Thursday, however, it became clear that the most extraordinary development of the 2024 election thus far was unfolding not inside the Republican convention hall in Milwaukee but among Democratic Party leaders so panicked about Trump's resurgent political fortunes that they were attempting to push aside their own incumbent President. The coup against Joe Biden, should it succeed, would represent something as unprecedented in its own way as the fact that the Republican Party has now formally ratified the decision to stake its future on a deeply unpopular, rapidly aging demagogue who was repudiated by voters only four years ago.\n\nAgainst such a backdrop, with Biden's fate uncertain after his disastrous debate performance three weeks ago and rumors of his imminent exit as abundant as the red Make America Great Again hats on the convention floor, Republicans, for once, seemed almost sublimely confident in their own chances of victory. \"Right now the Democrats are the perfect circular firing squad and we have the run of the field,\" Trump's longtime pollster Tony Fabrizio told a panel convened by the University of Chicago's Institute of Politics, which included the Democratic strategist David Axelrod, one of the loudest voices publicly pushing for Biden to exit, even warning that Democrats risked a \"landslide\" if he does not.\n\nEarlier in the week, many of the Convention speakers eagerly attacked the flailing Biden. Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida who flopped as an alternative to Trump in the primaries, bashed the incumbent's \"Weekend at Bernie's Presidency.\" Senator Tom Cotton, of Arkansas, talked about \"Joe Biden's chaos.\" Much of Vance's speech was framed as an attack on Biden, including the cutting line \"Joe Biden has been a politician in Washington for longer than I've been alive.\" Listening to a litany of Biden's shortcomings, the crowd interrupted with a cheer that had erupted several times during the week: \"Joe Must Go! Joe Must Go! Joe Must Go!\"\n\nIt was a mark of the moment that many Democrats, had they been having their own Convention this week, might have wanted to chant the very same thing.\n\nIn his own speech, Trump seemed to be anticipating that Democrats might just go through with it. He vowed to only use the word \"Biden\" once in his speech, while calling him one of the worst Presidents in history, if not the worst. The rest of his criticism was reserved for the more generic evils of the Biden Administration. Trump's entire campaign theme has been built around defeating Sleepy Joe Biden. He may soon have to pivot. But to whom? Against what?\n\nI have no idea what further disruptions await in this most extraordinary campaign. But listening to Trump talk on and on and on this Thursday evening, more than an hour and a half of strange and untruthful and incoherent freestyle rambling, it was hard to think that America was truly on the brink of reëlecting this man. He may have had a brush with death but he has not been reborn. He is the same Trump, only four years older, angrier, and far, far more incoherent than anyone who has any business being President of the United States. If Biden can't beat him, then surely someone else can-and must. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "In Orlando, Trump Kicks Off His Reëlection Campaign with an Old, Divisive Message\n\nIn a political speech, an emphasis placed on a single word can turn a promise into a threat. \"Republicans believe welfare, schools, hospitals, and public resources should be protected for all Americans,\" Donald Trump said on Tuesday night, as he launched his reëlection campaign at a rally in Orlando. Stress the word \"all\" and that line could almost pass for a statement of inclusion. But, for Trump, it was on \"Americans,\" with the word drawn out-\"Aah- mer -i-cans\"-as if to communicate that his aim is to leave certain people out, including families who are at home in the United States. But then the rhetoric that bracketed those words made his point quite clear. His prior sentence had been a declaration that \"nobody who supports sanctuary cities should be allowed to run for President of the United States,\" though he didn't explain what the instrument for disqualifying such candidates would be. The sentences immediately following sounded like a threat-a follow-up on his tweet, a day earlier, about imminent immigration raids affecting \"millions\" of people in this country. \"And, yes, yes, we are doing things that few others have tried to do,\" Trump said. \"Wait till you see some of the things that you're going to be hearing about over the next few months. We believe our country should be a sanctuary for law-abiding citizens, not for criminal aliens.\"\n\nIt would be worth asking Republican officials if they agree with Trump's definition of their party's creed. The Supreme Court, in 1982, found that children in America have a right to primary- and secondary-school public education, regardless of their or their families' immigration status-though Trump's rhetoric, it's worth noting, would seem to apply to legal non-citizen residents, too. His Administration is already pursuing a policy that would make a family's acceptance of a broad range of public services count against it in application proceedings. According to a report last week in the Times , the prospect that this measure will be put into effect has already led some immigrant parents to withdraw their children-including children who are citizens-from school-based nutrition and health programs. And what else might Trump put in the category of \"public resources\" that will not be protected for those he does not consider Americans?\n\nHis argument, on full display at the rally, is that Democrats don't really care about the well-being of the people whose votes they are trying to get-they have \"utter disdain\" for them, he said. His enemies are the ones \"trying to shred our Constitution and rip our country apart.\" They might attack him, but \"they are really going after you-that's what it's all about,\" he told the crowd. \"They are trying to erase your vote\" and \"to deny you the future that you demand\"-by which he meant a future with Trump. The swamp, he said, \"has been fighting back so viciously and violently.\" Only Trump can be trusted; the media doesn't tell people what's really happening. About Robert Mueller 's report-which established that the Russians attempted to influence the 2016 election but did not establish that the Trump campaign was involved in any criminal conspiracy with them, and which, at the same time, left open the question of whether Trump could be charged with obstruction of justice if he weren't President-Trump said, \"We won.\" He added, in a vague summation, that the business was \"a hoax. A great hoax. Our patriotic movement has been under assault from the first day.\"\n\nOn almost every subject, there was an appeal to populism and resentment, and intimations of seditious plots from within. He'd been elected once, he said, to \"reclaim our government from a permanent political class that enriched itself at your expense.\" His reëlection would be a verdict on \"the un-American conduct of those who try to undermine our great democracy and undermine you.\" And, he warned, \"no matter what label they use, a vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the American Dream.\"\n\nIt's safe to assume that Trump's attacks on his opponents will only escalate and become more personal and bitter, as the Democrats move toward choosing their nominee. (For the time being, there was a reference to \" Sleepy Joe .\") On the issue of abortion, Trump portrayed his opponents as theatrically evil: \"Leading Democrats have even opposed measures to prevent the execution of children after birth.\" (This is a wild distortion of issues and legislation related to late-term abortions.) Not incidentally, he also made this boast: \"I will soon have appointed my one-hundred-and-forty-fifth judge!\" He expressed amazement at how many seats Obama had left open, a subject on which he might consult with Merrick Garland.\n\n\"Four more years! Four more years!\" the crowd cheered-a reminder that this was not just any show but the season première of Trump 2020. (There were also chants of \"lock her up,\" which might be the eternal theme music for this production.) As usual, a selection of local politicians and preferred allies of the moment were on hand in Orlando-\"some really brilliant, tough, wonderful friends who helped me so much: Senators Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, Marco Rubio, of Florida, Rick Scott, of Florida.\" (In 2016, Graham and Rubio, who both ran for President, spoke about Trump in devastating terms; they have come around.) Trump also mentioned some of Florida's congressional representatives, whom he called his \"warriors.\" To make it more of an occasion, he also had with him his son Donald, Jr.; Vice-President Mike Pence and his wife, Karen; and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the departing press secretary, who was called onstage briefly to praise Trump to the skies (and to allow him to drop hints about her possible run for governor of Arkansas, in 2022). The First Lady, Melania Trump, who wafted across the stage in a jumpsuit of \"X-Men\" yellow, introduced her husband.\n\n\"We have a big decision to make,\" Trump told the crowd. It had to do with a replacement for what he described as \"probably and possibly the greatest theme in the history of politics\"-namely, \"Make America Great Again.\" \" MAGA country, right? MAGA ! MAGA !\" How, he asked, could he give it up? The logo alone was priceless! But, as he has at other appearances, he enlisted the crowd in a little test-marketing. What did they think of \"Keep America Great\"? \"Let me just hear by your cheers,\" he said. \"Are you ready?\" As he heard what seemed like a louder cheer for \" KAG ,\" he puckered his lips and nodded, in a caricature of a coach who's just been stunned by a phenom. \"Wow. Ah, I'm sorry, MAGA country, but that wasn't too close. I thought you had it won, and then I heard this cheer-my eardrums will never be the same! 'Keep America Great.' Pretty good.\" Maybe not good enough; a half-hour later, he ended his speech with an entreaty to \"Make America Great Again!\"\n\nSometimes, in deriding his opponents, Trump says something that applies better to his own situation. \"The only thing these corrupt politicians will understand is an earthquake at the ballot box,\" he said. He reminded the crowd that Election Day in 2020 would fall on November 3rd. \"Vote, vote, vote!\" he said. That is an injunction Democrats should remember. Vote, vote, vote. It is, as Trump told the crowd, going to be a \"big, big\" day.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Donald Trump's Inaugural Day of Vindication\n\nThe reëlected President reprised his \"American Carnage\" address, with repeated jabs at America's \"decline\" under Joe Biden, but his central theme, as always, was himself.\n\nDonald Trump's most enduring theme is himself-it always was and always will be. He is the Poet Laureate of self-aggrandizement. Hyperbole is how he lives and breathes. Everything he does is the greatest, the strongest, the boldest. On the eve of his return to the White House, the first ex-President in more than a century to reclaim the office, he promised thousands of red-hatted supporters at a rally in Washington \"the best first day, the biggest first week, and the most extraordinary first hundred days of any Presidency in American history.\" No need to wait for history to render its judgment. Back in November, when he defeated Kamala Harris only four years after being repudiated by the voters, he had declared his comeback win a result of \"the greatest political movement of all time,\" and promised that his second term in office would become \"the golden age of America.\"\n\nTrump, who first gained fame in the nineteen-eighties for erecting a gilded skyscraper bearing his name in New York, returned to the theme of a golden age on Monday, in an Inaugural Address that, again and again, conflated himself and the country he will once again lead. The speech included a remarkable statement-that the Supreme Being had called this noted sinner back to power. \"Over the past eight years, I have been tested and challenged more than any President in our two-hundred-and-fifty-year history,\" Trump claimed-a reference, I suppose, to the two assassination attempts he faced during the 2024 campaign and the multiple legal challenges that eventually made him the first convicted felon ever to be elected President. His conclusion? \"I was saved by God to make America great again.\"\n\nTrump never mentioned his predecessor by name, but he could not have been more pointed about January 20th as \"Liberation Day\" from Joe Biden , a man who, four years ago, promised to return the country to normalcy after Trump's chaotic and dysfunctional first term, but who instead set the stage for Trump's return. The country, on Biden's watch, had suffered \"a horrible betrayal,\" Trump said, and he began his speech lamenting \"America's decline,\" an echo of his famous \"American Carnage\" address from 2017. His catalogue of the previous Administration's failings included everything from immigration policy to an education system that, he claimed, teaches kids \"to hate our country.\" But, as always, Trump's biggest passion was for the things that touched him personally, nothing more so than what he said was Biden's \"vicious, violent, and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department\" against him and his supporters.\n\nTrump's many personal grievances-and his obvious delight in the vindication that his victory represents-are what made this Inauguration so different from any of its predecessors, including his first one, eight years ago. His 2017 Inaugural Address was the shortest recent Inaugural; Monday's was the longest in recent memory, clocking in at twenty-nine minutes. It was overtly partisan and explicitly self-promotional-the marriage of a campaign rally and a State of the Union, with not much more than a token nod to the aspirational rhetoric that is usually the sum total of such speeches. Past Presidents have used the occasion to speak of the better angels of our nature, to banish fear and summon the best of America. Trump offered \"drill, baby, drill,\" and a pledge to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America. Previous Inaugurals have been brief, elegiac, inspirational; Trump's was rambling, incoherent, and blustery. What, in the end, should we think about a speech that essentially threatened war against Panama but never even mentioned the deadly conflict in Europe that he once promised to end in his first twenty-four hours back in power?\n\nIt was always going to be a day of dissonance. But Trump's swearing-in at the Capitol Rotunda, driven indoors by frigid weather, offered certain benefits of clarity-illuminating, among other things, who rates in his second Administration and who does not. The image of America's wealthiest men-Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg-standing in front of Trump's incoming Cabinet, and right behind Trump's own children, was a revealing chart of power in the new Washington. The absence of a cheering throng of Trump's MAGA supporters only reinforced the notion of an emergent and dangerous tech \"oligarchy,\" as Biden warned about last week, in a farewell address filled with barbs at his successor. More traditional powers, such as America's governors, were relegated to the overflow room. Take that, Ron DeSantis.\n\nBut, on Monday, it was Biden as much as Trump who offered a sharp illustration of the day's contradictory messages. Before breakfast, the outgoing President announced that he had preëmptively pardoned many of those atop Trump's list of enemies-such as the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley, who defied Trump, and the members of the House January 6th Committee who investigated him. A couple of hours later, Biden stood on the White House steps to warmly greet the man who had prompted him to take such an unprecedented step. \"Welcome home,\" he said. Less than an hour after that, Biden, a President who had repeatedly chided Trump as a threat to democratic norms, pardoned five of his own family members as his final act in office, an exercise of personal power that made even many of his Democratic allies uncomfortable. It wasn't even noon, and the day felt dizzying.\n\nMost disorienting of all might have been the painful memories conjured by the setting for the ceremony itself, inside the Capitol where, four years and two weeks ago, a violent insurrection of Trump supporters sought to block certification of Biden's victory. Trump did not mention the January 6th rioters in his speech at the rotunda, but, later on Monday, he was preparing to pardon or commute the sentences of many of those who were charged for their role that day, fulfilling a campaign-season pledge to those whom he now calls heroes and martyrs. This, too, was clarifying.\n\nTrump's return to power, in a crime scene born of his own refusal to concede defeat, is, for me at least, the day's unforgettable image, the thing that I'll remember long after his promise to \"end the electric-vehicle mandate,\" which does not exist, or rename an Alaskan mountain peak after his fellow tariff-loving President William McKinley. This is who Trump is. I laughed out loud on Monday morning at the Wall Street Journal's preview of Trump's speech, which promised it would be \"optimistic\" and upbeat. It was not. And yet I am also quite convinced that Trump's followers-that not-quite fifty per cent of the electorate that returned him to power-will soon enough find a way to forgive him, as they did for the unforgivable events of January 6th, when he falls short, as he inevitably must, of his extravagant promises of magical transformation.\n\nThere is still much that we don't know about Trump's next four years, of course, and it would be foolish to issue predictions, given a first term that featured two impeachments, a global pandemic, and the 2020 election he refused to accept. But Trump's own Inaugural Address has shown us that the key fact about his second term is the same as his first-for this President, it's always all about him. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "website": "https://www.newyorker.com",
      "text": "How Donald Trump, the Leader of White Grievance, Gained Among Hispanic Voters\n\nEight years ago, at the dawn of the Donald Trump era, Toni Morrison spoke for many liberals when she described his election as a reaction to the \"collapse of white privilege.\" In an essay called \" Making America White Again ,\" published in this magazine, Morrison argued that in the aftermath of Barack Obama's Presidency many white people felt driven to \"keep alive the perception of white superiority.\" And she lamented \"how eagerly so many white voters-both the poorly educated and the well educated-embraced the shame and fear sowed by Donald Trump.\"\n\nThis vision of Trump as the leader of an aggrieved white America took hold broadly during the early years of his term, boosted by the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, scarcely six months after he took office. Some of the marchers, who objected to the removal of a monument to Robert E. Lee , were carrying Confederate flags, and some were wearing \"Make America Great Again\" hats. After a counter-protester was run over and killed by a man who had praised both Trump and Adolf Hitler, Trump delivered remarks that helped define his Presidency. \"You had some very bad people in that group, but you also had people that were very fine people, on both sides,\" he said. (He also added a qualifying follow-up: \"I'm not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists-because they should be condemned totally.\")\n\nThe idea that Trump was a white nationalist in disguise was horrifying to his opponents, but it was also seductive, because it made him seem like a fringe character, the kind of politician who might inspire a multiracial coalition of decent folks to rise up against him. Especially, perhaps, Latinos, since invective against Hispanic immigration was so central to Trump's 2016 campaign . Instead, in his second run for the Presidency, Trump improved his performance among Hispanic voters: according to a Pew study , he lost that group by thirty-eight points in 2016, but only twenty-one points in 2020. The data seem to suggest that Joe Biden was elected President that year only because Trump underperformed among one group in particular: non-Hispanic whites.\n\nThis week, the notion of Trump as the leader of a distinctively white movement became harder to defend. Although exit-poll data can be unreliable, there are signs that, in his extraordinary comeback, he continued to assemble a coalition that is not unusually white but, rather, unusually nonwhite, by the standards of the recent Republican Party. For instance, Trump became the first Republican in more than a century to win Starr County, along the Mexican border in Texas, which is almost entirely Hispanic; he did similarly well throughout the state's majority-Hispanic border counties. It is possible that Trump also made gains among Black voters, who remain a much more reliable Democratic constituency, but we don't yet have dispositive data. One theory is that Trump does better among non-college-educated voters over all, including nonwhite ones; this argument is consistent with both his popularity among some traditionally non-Republican constituencies and his unpopularity among members of the cultural élite, including some former Republicans .\n\nLink copied\n\nAs the results rolled in on Tuesday night, the racial diversity of the Trump coalition was discussed across the cable-news spectrum. \"What we've heard from both campaigns is that Donald Trump is doing a little bit better with African Americans, especially African American men, than he did last time,\" Jake Tapper said on CNN, a little after ten o'clock, as Democrats were starting to fret. \"It's clear now that Donald Trump has picked up key support among Hispanic voters,\" Michele Norris, of MSNBC, said about an hour later, as the camera showed grave-looking Harris supporters at Howard University. \"Long term, Democrats are going to have to think about-they're losing their coalition,\" Katie Pavlich said on Fox News, at eleven-thirty-seven, by which point Trump's supporters were ready to celebrate.\n\nConsidering the tumult of the past four years, it was striking how little the Presidential candidates talked about race this year, at least explicitly. In this abbreviated campaign, unlike in 2020 , Kamala Harris seemed intent on avoiding the subject. And although, in campaigns past, political arguments about crime have often been interpreted as veiled appeals to racial identity , Trump tends to talk as if most American crime is the fault of immigrant groups-Haitian migrants, perhaps, or Venezuelan gangs. Claims like these are insulting to those immigrant groups, but they are also flattering to a broad range of Americans, who can imagine themselves as part of a diverse country where all the locals are basically well behaved.\n\nLate in the campaign, during a Trump rally at Madison Square Garden, one of his opening acts, the antagonistic comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, threatened to disrupt this state of affairs. He made a joke about Puerto Rico being a \"floating island of garbage,\" which for a time became the campaign's top story. Nicky Jam, a reggaetón star from the island, un-endorsed Trump (\" Puerto Rico se respeta ,\" he said-\"Respect Puerto Rico\"), and Democrats traded hopeful stories about Puerto Rican voters on the mainland who were angrily turning against Trump. But, like so many things that happened during the campaign, this didn't seem to matter much: Osceola, a majority-Hispanic county in Florida with a large Puerto Rican population, swung from a fourteen-point Biden victory in 2020 to a narrow Trump victory this year.\n\nIt's possible, maybe likely, that Trump's second term will bring a new series of statements or policies that reinvigorates our old arguments about racism in America, and that gives fresh ammunition to critics who view him as a white supremacist in disguise, or perhaps not in disguise. It is true, too, that what it means to be white in America has changed over time; perhaps Trump's coalition will help Americans rethink the assumption that \"white\" and \"Hispanic\" are mutually exclusive categories, and will boost a new version of the old white identity. But, as far as we can tell, Trump's America is a place that is more polarized by education than it used to be and less polarized by whiteness and non-whiteness-by race, broadly understood. This switch, if it holds, may be bad for Democrats, at least in the short term. But if one party no longer represents whiteness so specifically, isn't that good for America? ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "The Weird New Normal of Donald Trump in 2024\n\nOn Christmas Day, Donald Trump issued his traditional holiday greeting. Posting on Truth Social, the social-media site created to serve as a platform for both his personal enrichment and his political aggrandizement, he reprised his threats to reclaim the Panama Canal from its current state of being controlled by the country in which it exists, tweaked Canada as America's future \"51st state,\" pushed his plan to purchase Greenland \"for National Security purposes,\" and wished a merry Christmas to the \"Radical Left Lunatics\" he so recently defeated in \"the Greatest Election in the History of Our Country.\" Would it be too 2016 of me to suggest that this is absurd, embarrassing, worrisome stuff? As 2024 ends, the prevailing attitude toward the manic stylings and overheated threats of the once and future President, even among his diehard critics, seems to be more one of purposeful indifference than of explicit resistance; call it surrender or simply resignation to the political reality that Trump, despite it all, is twenty-five days away from returning to the Oval Office.\n\nA year ago, a Trump victory was far from inconceivable-the grimly anti-incumbent mood of the American electorate, and the former President's almost comically easy dispatch of a host of G.O.P. primary challengers who were, for the most part, afraid to criticize him, suggested that it was not only a possible outcome but even a likely one. Yet it is also true that, as 2024 began, Trump's win was far from inevitable-an alternate reality that, like the half of the country that could not countenance his return to office, has been erased from the Trumpian narrative about his \"unprecedented and powerful mandate.\" In the weeks since Election Day, it's been as if Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and all the polite technocratic debates of their polite, technocratic Administration have vanished into the mists of time-were the past four years in Washington all some strange dream sequence, like that entire season of \"Dallas\" back in the nineteen-eighties?\n\nRadical revisionism-by Trump and on his behalf-is a strong contender for the theme of this disruptive year, in which some unique property of political alchemy managed to transform a defeated and disgraced ex-President facing four criminal indictments into a perfectly electable Republican candidate with a quirky communications style, a host of more or less legitimate grievances, and a plan to Make America Great Again by empowering his billionaire sidekicks and rolling back laws, regulations, geopolitical trends, and social norms that he and his voters don't like. Rewriting history, relitigating old fights, plain old revanchism-these worked for Trump in 2024, and it's a safe bet that, along with revenge and retribution, they will be the themes of the new Trump Administration that takes office on January 20th.\n\nWhether it's peremptory attacks on a 1977 Panama Canal treaty whose terms he now wants to reject or the resurrection of nineteenth-century economic protectionism or the fantastical reimagining of the January 6th rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol as innocent martyrs, Trump is a conservative in an entirely different sense than the one we have come to know: he is not a Republican who sticks to the status quo but instead a would-be strongman whose attachment to a past of his own imagining will now, once again, become the country's governing ideology.\n\nEvery year since 2018 , I have written a version of this year-end Letter from Washington. What's striking reading back through them now, on the eve of Trump's return to the White House, is not so much his continued dominance of our politics as it is the consistency of how he has accomplished it-the manic governing by social-media pronouncement, the bizarro news cycles, and the normalizing of what would have previously been considered the politically un-normalizable. Even his targets are remarkably similar year in and year out-the Radical Left Lunatics, windmills, Justin Trudeau. In Trump's 2023 Christmas social-media post, he wished the nation a happy holiday while praying that his enemies \"ROT IN HELL.\" What we have managed to forget about Trump in these past few years would fill entire books about other Presidents. This year-end exercise has been a small effort in trying to remember.\n\nThis strikes me as more important than ever in 2024, after an election year in which tapping into the American capacity for collective forgetting proved to be one of Trump's superpowers. Many of the year's signal events were so dramatic that they don't need much recounting now: Trump's unprecedented criminal trial and his thirty-four felony convictions in a New York state court last May; the incoherent June 27th debate that effectively ended Biden's career; the attempted assassination of Trump as he spoke at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13th, and the remarkable images of him thrusting his fist in the air and mouthing \"Fight!\" immediately after a bullet grazed his ear but spared his life. It was just a few days later that Biden dropped out of the race, reinvigorating Democrats with sudden hope that they might beat Trump, after all-only to have Harris, despite a surge of joyous online memes and more than a billion dollars in campaign contributions, suffer an even bigger defeat to Trump than Hillary Clinton's shocking loss to him in 2016.\n\nEven the subsidiary plotlines of 2024 were epic, from the spectre of the world's richest man leaping around Trump's rallies like an overheated schoolboy to the scorching success of a Republican ad campaign that portrayed America as a dangerous hellscape of invading illegal immigrants, rampant inflation, and intolerant leftists eager to force transgender surgery on your children. Soon after the election, Trump tried to appoint Matt Gaetz as Attorney General, even knowing that the Florida Republican had been investigated by his own congressional colleagues for paying a minor for sex-a choice that resulted in one of the fastest implosions of a  Cabinet selection in modern history.\n\nWe will not soon forget all that. Where Trump benefits more from this failure to remember is in the common practice, among his allies and detractors alike, of disregarding much of what he says and does, whether it is his vow to close the U.S. border and begin the largest mass deportations in American history on the first day of his Presidency, to end the war in Ukraine in twenty-four hours, or to nullify the Constitution's guarantee of birthright citizenship. So that's what I'm most hoping does not get lost in this apathetic moment, when his enemies are averting their gaze and his allies are so confident in the imminent arrival of a MAGA utopia that they have little need to sweat the details. (A new Associated Press / NORC poll, released Thursday, says sixty-five per cent of American adults now feel the need to limit their consumption of news about politics and the government-the Great Tune-Out is real.)\n\nHeading into 2025, I do not believe that warnings about the dangers of an unchecked Trump are overstated. Instead, it is the creeping sense that Trump is entering office largely unopposed that more and more worries me. It is a major warning sign, among many, that the ideological policing of Trump's adversaries as shrill, hysterical, and hypocritical has been so very effective. I am bracing for impact, and not only fearing but expecting the worst.\n\nBut while Trump may now believe himself so powerful that he can rewrite history on his own behalf, it's also fair to anticipate that his past will serve not only as prologue but as precedent for 2025. If neither the American voters nor the Republican Party could stop Trump, his many personal weaknesses just might. Presidents, especially second-term Presidents, often stumble. Many occupants of the White House find themselves bogged down in scandal and infighting, victims of their own overreach, hubris, or just sheer incompetence. This was the story of the first Trump Administration, and there is plenty of reason to believe that it will be what happens in his second term, too. Should one root for the failure of an American President? Half of the country, Trump's half, did this, to great effect, in 2024; in 2025, it will be everybody else's turn. ♦\n\nThe best movies .\n\nThe best jokes .\n\nThe best books .\n\nThe best podcasts .\n\nOur most popular cartoons on Instagram.\n\nThe animals that made it all worth it .\n\nSign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New Yorker .\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "The Trump Campaign Brings Its Angry Tone to the Coronavirus Era\n\nDonald Trump, Jr., the President 's eldest son, thinks that his father is getting a raw deal. In a recent appearance on \"Team Trump Online\"-a nightly video series that serves as a substitute for campaign rallies and often attracts more than a million viewers-he complained that his father is having to wage war against \"the deep-state guys\" and unchecked attacks from \"influencers on the other side.\" He said that each reporter at the White House briefings \"has an agenda, and that is to destroy Donald Trump.\" Joe Biden \"can't remember where he is fifty per cent of the time,\" Trump, Jr., said, but he can count on the \"media lackeys\" who are the \"marketing wing of the Democrat Party.\" The Democrats, he added, are \"becoming the party of socialism and communism.\" That includes Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib-\"you know, the Hamas caucus in Congress.\" As for the COVID -19 outbreak , which has caused more than eighty thousand deaths in the U.S. to date, he said, \"China basically screwed the whole world.\"\n\nVenom and victimization largely define the President's public persona, and the same holds true for the online campaign. Biden became the presumptive Democratic nominee in early March, and the COVID -19 pandemic put a halt to barnstorming a few weeks later, but the rhetoric of Trump's campaign has barely budged. On March 12th, as the coronavirus crisis was taking hold in the United States, it e-mailed its supporters a photograph of Trump, ruddy face fully made up, a flag pin in his lapel, sitting behind the Resolute desk in the Oval Office, looking steely. The e-mail said that there is \"no room for partisanship, and the President is calling on both parties in Congress to unite.\" The very next day, when Trump declared a national emergency, the campaign reverted to form, blasting \"Sleepy Joe\" and \"Crazy Bernie.\" Last weekend, after the Justice Department dropped its charges against Michael Flynn, Trump's former national-security adviser, who had twice pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I., the campaign crowed, in a fund-raising text, \"Justice for Gen Flynn! A WITCH HUNT from day 1! ALL GIFTS TRIPLED TO DRAIN THE SWAMP .\"\n\nAnyone who has attended Trump's rallies, where thousands of fans in MAGA hats whoop and cheer at his insults and diatribes, can attest that the President, ever a showman, knows how to play to his target audiences. And, yet, as Biden edges into the lead in key states, such as Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Florida, pollsters and political strategists are questioning whether Trump's perennial pitch can carry him to victory on November 3rd. His political base is loyal but narrow. When Democrats scored heavily in the suburbs in the 2018 midterms, and captured a majority in the House of Representatives, it was women voters who made the difference. A recent Quinnipiac poll in Florida showed Trump lagging behind Biden among women, and also among two groups that delivered crucial support in 2016: voters over the age of sixty-five and voters who dislike both candidates. When I asked Douglas Schwartz, the director of the Quinnipiac poll, about the survey, he said that Biden does better among both groups on honesty, leadership, and empathy. \"These numbers are a warning sign for his campaign,\" Schwartz said of the President.\n\nThe Trump campaign brags about an army of field organizers, the cell-phone numbers of tens of millions of supporters, and a new app that connects voters to news, virtual events, and volunteer opportunities, from fund-raising to voter registration. Each is a significant upgrade from Trump's 2016 effort, which relied on his outsized personality, his televised rallies, and the power of social media. The current operation, led by Brad Parscale , who ran Trump's successful Facebook marketing campaign in 2016, has raised more than seven hundred and thirty million dollars. In cash-on-hand, Biden lags tens of millions of dollars behind. \"It's not like a campaign of grievance and anger and fear hasn't been a pillar of American politics since there was an American politics,\" Cornell Belcher, a Democratic pollster who worked on Barack Obama's Presidential campaigns, said. \"That's exactly how Trump won.\" Republicans are right to be worried, Belcher added, but even as Trump struggles to expand his base COVID -19 and the plunging economy are making predictions difficult. \"Given that environment, where people are afraid and anxious-and understandably so-can you count out a candidate peddling grievance and fear?\"\n\nIn hundreds of different versions of its standard pitch, Trump's campaign complains, boasts, and beseeches. The President, his surrogates, and the campaign staff spray a familiar buckshot of belittling nicknames and insults at a cast that includes \"Sleepy Joe,\" \"Crazy Bernie,\" and \"Crooked Hillary,\" who were recently joined by \"Cheatin' Obama.\" An e-mail on Monday, targeting Biden, asked supporters to \"show the Left that you REJECT their corrupt candidate,\" while one on Friday called Biden \"a certified CROOK.\" During a recent \"Team Trump Online\" broadcast, Parscale bragged about \"a roll of Hillary Clinton toilet paper that I use every time I'm in a bad mood. I have boxes of it, and I take it into the bathroom, and it's just enjoyable.\"\n\nAnother regular target is the \"Lamestream\" media, the \"enemy of the people,\" ever in cahoots with \"the Radical Left-wing MOB.\" Together, Trump warned in an e-mail earlier this year, these elements are pushing a \"non-stop propaganda campaign of LIES to try and destroy me.\" With nary a mention of his own wealthy backers, Trump slams \"the establishment,\" along with the \"Hollywood elite\" and \"foreign enemies,\" declaring, in one solicitation, \"They all HATE you, and that's why they want to steal your vote. It's US against THEM.\" The April 27th \"Team Trump Online\" session was led by Katrina Pierson, a former Tea Party activist, whose guests included Representative Dan Crenshaw, a military veteran from Texas. She described Barack Obama as a \"faint-hearted\" Commander-in-Chief, while Crenshaw told viewers that Democrats \"will lie through their teeth. They're doing it all the time.\"\n\nIn its texts and e-mails, the campaign seeks donations and valuable voter contact information by offering a steady supply of Trump-branded merchandise, from football jerseys, Christmas ornaments, and doormats to plastic straws, a swipe at liberal locales that have been banning them to help the environment. The offers have continued unabated during the COVID -19 crisis. Last Saturday, the campaign wrote supporters to say Trump knows that recent weeks have been \"extremely difficult for Americans from all across the Nation.\" The e-mail said that the President is grateful for \"your unwavering support\" and wants to do \"something special for you to show how much your loyalty means to him.\" The message continued, \"He's asked us to give you EXCLUSIVE ACCESS to get our Official Trump-Pence Pint Glasses.\" The cost for a set: thirty-one dollars. \"But, we have an extremely limited supply, so we can only hold them until 11:59 PM TONIGHT.\"\n\nI asked David Sable, the former head of the marketing agency Y. & R., to assess the Trump campaign as a marketing effort. \"His base loves it,\" said Sable, who explained that Trump has \"brand power\" derived from what he called the \"brand experience,\" which is part show, part substance. \"The key is to get those people to recruit other people. If you can do that, you're way ahead of the game. That's basically the way the guy operates,\" Sable said. According to Sable, Trump's team, to its credit, \"understands simplicity.\" The \"Make America Great Again\" message, in 2016, was straightforward, and so is the \"Keep America Great\" message in 2020, according to Sable: \"At the end of the day, I've done a great job, I will continue to do a great job, and I will fix this to get back to the great job I was doing.\"\n\nTrump has repeatedly bragged about his Administration's leadership during the pandemic. In April, as governors were shutting down their states and complaining of a slipshod federal response, Trump said his Administration was doing a \"spectacular job .\" He predicted that the economy will take off \"like a rocket ship.\" The message of once and future success is a hallmark of the nightly \"Team Trump Online\" broadcasts, led by surrogates from their homes. On one recent show, hosted by Trump's former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, Representative Matt Gaetz asserted that Americans miss the \"optimism fuelled by the energy of our enthusiastic President.\" On another night, the Reverend Robert Jeffress, a Fox News contributor who leads the First Baptist Church in Dallas, said that Trump had quoted Isaiah 60:2 to faith leaders on Good Friday. Jeffress expressed his gratitude for a President who acknowledges dark times \"but is an optimistic leader who points us to the future.\"\n\nThe campaign is trying to attract African-American voters through a project called \"Black Voices for Trump, which includes a regular online show. \" (\"Text WOKE to 88022.\") The co-chairs of the Voices advisory board are the former pizza executive Herman Cain, who withdrew from the 2012 Presidential race amid sexual-harassment claims, and the Trump-promoting television personalities Lynnette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson, known as Diamond and Silk . In March, they wondered aloud , on their Fox Nation show, whether the COVID -19 death toll was artificially inflated to make Trump look bad; Richardson speculated that the virus was man-made, \"a little deep-state action going on behind the scenes.\" As the Trump campaign opens field offices in black neighborhoods in Detroit, Milwaukee, and Philadelphia, Belcher cautions against dismissing the effort or the choice of surrogates. \"He doesn't need fifteen, sixteen, twenty per cent\" of the black vote, he said of Trump. \"If he takes two or three per cent more than he did in 2016 in most of these battleground states, it positions him really well.\"\n\nThe slogan of last Friday night's \"Team Trump Online\" show , designed to attract young voters, was \"Vote for America's Future.\" Hosted by John Pence , a nephew of the Vice-President, the conversation participants included Benny Johnson, who works for the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA, and Danielle D'Souza Gill, a writer whose commentator father, Dinesh D'Souza, illegally funnelled contributions to a Republican Senate candidate and was pardoned by Trump. Johnson praised protesters in Michigan and California who are \"fighting for liberty\" against \"Orwellian, totalitarian lockdowns.\" Gill, without offering evidence, then targeted Trump's Democratic opponent: \"If we think about Joe Biden, the amount of corruption that we've seen with him, with Hunter Biden. We've seen his sexual-assault allegations, his mental stability, so many things.\" Pence listened and responded, \"So true. I like to think that President Trump made the Republican Party great again by making it unequivocally the party of freedom. As you all said, we love the American dream, we love money, because we want to have a fair shot to pursue our dreams in this country.\"\n\nThe contrast with the Biden campaign's online presence and message could hardly be starker. Although pointed when attacking Trump, the former Vice-President's online pitch is generally quieter, with less frequent offerings and more established surrogates. A recent YouTube program, aimed at military veterans, featured former Secretary of State John Kerry, who offered a detailed critique of Trump's national-security approach, followed by Carlyn Reichel, a policy adviser, who led viewers through Biden's positions. Another online event, called \" S.O.U.L. Saturday Rally ,\" was a forty-five-minute assortment of speeches and video advertisements, which included Biden and his wife, Jill, speaking from his Delaware basement. There was a heavy dose of thanks to first responders and others on the COVID -19 front lines. One video urged supporters to exercise \"kindness, humility, empathy.\" Biden's daughter, Ashley, played a prominent role, ending her remarks by urging viewers to \"stay safe, stay well, and be kind to one another. We are our brother's keeper.\" In the midst of a nerve-jangling pandemic, Biden's team is calculating that voters are seeking steadiness, calm, and compassion. When I asked Mike Gwin, Biden's deputy director of rapid response, about the campaign's understated approach, he replied, \"Americans are tired of the constant chaos and pettiness coming from Trump and the White House.\"\n\nFive unpredictable months ahead of Election Day, it remains to be seen which messages will work with which voters. Robert Orr, a Republican who retired as a North Carolina Supreme Court justice in 2004, is a Trump skeptic who tries to dissuade Republicans from voting to reëlect the President. He believes there are a \"stunning\" number of people who ran for office as Republicans, or who donated to Republican candidates, who are \"disgusted with Trump and where he has dragged the Republican Party, with this negative messaging, with this mean-spirited personality.\" Nor does he think Trump has another gear. \"He simply can't change,\" Orr, said. Until a few years ago, three members of his immediate family, counting his children's spouses, were registered Republicans, three were unaffiliated but tended to vote Republican, and two were registered Democrats. \"I'm the only registered Republican left in the family. I couldn't beg 'em to vote for a Republican,\" he said. \"Not only are they not going to vote for Trump-they're not going to vote for any Republicans. You can't drive as many long-term Republicans into the arms of the Democrats and not be doing something wrong.\"\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Joe Biden, MAGA Democrat\n\nJoe Biden officially kicked off his long-expected 2020 campaign on Thursday with a video featuring footage from the 2017 white supremacist march and counterprotest in Charlottesville, Virginia. In his telling of the origin story of his latest White House bid, the moment President Donald Trump said that there were \" some very fine people on both sides \" of that clash was when Biden realized that \"we are in the battle for the soul of this nation.\"\n\n\"I believe history will look back on four years of this president and all he embraces as an aberrant moment in time,\" Biden says. \"But if we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation-who we are-and I cannot stand by and watch that happen. The core values of this nation, our standing in the world, our very democracy, everything that has made America, America, is at stake.\"\n\nBiden's pitch is many things-emotionally compelling, politically shrewd, and a little presumptuous, among them. But it is one thing above all else: convenient.\n\nBiden is telling many Americans who oppose Trump, particularly white ones, what they want to hear: that Trump's election-like what happened in Virginia the following summer-was an aberration, a tumor that can be surgically excised from the body politic, and not a symptom of an underlying disease that's been present since the nation's birth.\n\nThe desire to reduce American history to a series of individual moments is natural, particularly for a politician, but in this case the oversimplification gives Biden the chance to choose which moments \"made America, America,\" and which can be brushed aside as isolated incidents uncharacteristic of that same \"America.\" And so when images of the women's suffrage and civil rights movements flash on screen, Biden is asking his audience to see that progress as what defines America, rather than the centuries of disenfranchisement based on gender and race that preceded it and the racism and sexism that remain. Consider how Biden chose to begin the video (emphasis mine):\n\nCharlottesville, Virginia, is home to the author of one of the great documents in human history. We know it by heart: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights.\" ... We haven't always lived up to these ideals; Jefferson himself didn't . But we have never before walked away from them.\n\nIn the span of three words, Biden shrugs off Thomas Jefferson's ownership of slaves-and the nation's long embrace of slavery along with it-as a failure to live up to a professed set of ideals, as opposed to the conscious decision to compromise those ideals. Biden's hardly the first politician to don rose-colored glasses when looking upon American history, but few Democrats wear them so regularly as he does today.\n\nAs I've noted before , Biden loves to wax nostalgic about the bipartisan days of yore, seemingly unable to grasp that the friends he made back during his early days in the U.S. Capitol were segregationists like Strom Thurmond and Jesse Helms , or that Congress was so male-dominated when he first arrived that it would take another two decades before women got their own restroom off the Senate floor. It's why Biden praises the late John McCain, defends Vice President Mike Pence, and vouches for Republican congressmen who've spent their careers working to thwart progress. To Biden, public service is a noble act, regardless of what one does with one's power. Trump makes plain the flaw in that logic, and so Biden must write him out of history as somehow un-American.\n\nBiden is asking us to believe that Trump emerged from thin air-to ignore the reality that the Republican Party nominated him, after long exploiting a strategy of racial resentment -and to forget that 63 million Americans ultimately cast their ballots for him. It would be a stretch to say Biden wants to Make America Great Again in the nationalist sense Trump means it. But Biden, like Trump, is holding up the past as an example of where the nation needs to go. He is saying that America has always been great-still will be as long as Trump is denied another four years.\n\nFolks, America's an idea, an idea that's stronger than any army, bigger than any ocean, more powerful than any dictator or tyrant. It gives hope to the most desperate people on earth. It guarantees that everyone is treated with dignity and gives hate no safe harbor. It instills in every person in this country the belief that no matter where you start in life, there's nothing you can't achieve if you work at it. That's what we believe. And above all else, that's what's at stake in this election.\n\nSuch a Pollyannaish view of America is hardly unique to Biden, but it is uniquely helpful to his case when running in a crowded Democratic field. Biden's biggest liability in the primary is his long record on the national stage, much of which looks downright conservative by today's standards. And so Biden needs voters to believe that America before Trump is an America worth returning to-because the America before Trump is also the America that Joe Biden helped build. He spent 36 years in the U.S. Senate, including stints as the powerful chairman of the Foreign Relations and Judiciary committees, and then another eight years by President Barack Obama's side. Biden, then, has been a key contributor to roughly one-fifth of the nation's 243-year political history, a slice of time that has seen remarkable progress but also plenty of setbacks.\n\nIn the 1970s, Biden was a vocal opponent of school integration. In the 1980s, he was a law-and-order drug warrior. In the 1990s, he held the judiciary gavel during the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings and helped pass the draconian Clinton crime bill. In the 2000s, he voted to authorize the invasion of Iraq and to pass bank-friendly bankruptcy reform. Most Americans look back fondly, for good reason, at the Obama administration in which Biden served faithfully, but it wasn't without its flaws: Obama exponentially expanded the use of drones, failed to close Guantánamo Bay, and opted not to prosecute big banks and other bad actors in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, among other shortcomings.\n\nAll of that makes the story of Joe Biden-and the pre-Trump history of modern America-far more complicated than Biden is ready to admit. Biden closed his launch video by urging Americans to \"remember who we are,\" but in reality he's asking us to forget much more. He's offering voters a deal in 2020: Forgive his political sins, and they can ignore the nation's as well.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "A Quick Summary of Why Only White People Want to Make America Great \"Again\"\n\nAndrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nRebecca Traister has a big New York magazine cover story this week about the history and political implications of the United States' increasing population of unmarried women . You should go read the whole thing, which covers the Clinton/Sanders feminist divide (among other subjects) in detail. But there's one point the article makes implicitly, almost as an aside, that grabbed my attention because of what it says about the Republican side of the 2016 race. Here's the excerpt in question (which I first saw on Joel Anderson 's Twitter feed):\n\nThe economic benefits extended to the white middle class, both during the New Deal and in the post-World War II years, did not extend to African-Americans. Social Security, created in 1935, did not apply to either domestic laborers or to agricultural workers. ­Discriminatory hiring practices, the low percentages of black workers in the country's newly strengthened labor unions, and the ­persistent racial wage gap, along with the fact that many colleges barred the admission of black students, meant that returning black servicemen had a far harder time taking advantage of the GI Bill's promise of college education. And the suburbs that bloomed around American cities after the war were built almost entirely for white families.\n\nYou may have heard that the leading Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump, wants to \"Make America great again.\" You might also have heard that Trump's strongest/only supporters come from the white working class . The paragraph above explains why that might be so. The United States, in living memory, was a better/more affordable place for the working class in part because of government retirement benefits, union-friendly laws, federally subsidized home loans, and federally subsidized education. One of the reasons that there was so much of this \" free stuff \" available to white people back in the day is that it wasn't available to nonwhite people . Discrimination meant there were bigger slices of the pie to go around, so to speak, for every white person.\n\nEspecially when compared with other more strikingly abhorrent harms like lynching and water-fountain segregation, this kind of (relatively!) subtle economic discrimination is not part of the story of civil rights in the 20 th century that white Americans learn in school and elsewhere. But it's a pretty good reason why black voters and other nonwhite voters would not want to make America more like it used to be.\n\nNow if we could only figure out how to fit \"the egalitarian economic benefits of the postwar American economy were disproportionately available to white Americans because of officially sanctioned racism\" on a hat.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The MAGA Hat Hat\n\nDonald Trump's strange, seemingly impromptu dance performance isn't the only way his campaign has taken a Dadaist turn as of late-his online store has also started selling a piece of merch that simultaneously doubles as an arresting postmodern commentary on the nature of merch.\n\nWhen I first saw the item, I wanted to share it with my colleagues, but I struggled to describe it: The Trump-Vance 2024 store calls it the \" Little Red MAGA Hat ,\" but it's not actually what that sounds like, which is a smaller, maybe kid-size version of Trump's famous red hats. Rather, it's a white baseball hat featuring an-embroidered, I assume-illustration of those hats. It is, in the same funny way the \"Monster Mash\" is technically a song about a different, unheard song/dance called the Monster Mash ( look it up ), not a MAGA hat but a hat that refers to the concept of MAGA hats. The blog Boing Boing put it perfectly : It's a MAGA hat hat.\n\nThese hats are, I'm sorry to say, hilarious. I don't like it either, but it's true. The gimmick doesn't work nearly as well in T-shirt form, which the campaign is also hawking , but never mind that. The existence of these hats is about the millionth reminder of how funny Trump is despite it all. He shouldn't be. No right-thinking person wants to be laughing at such an evil, disgusting man. And yet, as the saying goes , we feel bad for our country, but this is tremendous content.\n\nStill, the hats seem wholly out of place with the rest of the campaign's merch. Did the ghost of René Magritte drop in to do this one thing? As funny as Trump is, he's not usually clever , and these seem more like something a brainy comedian would bring out as a prop during a late-night show appearance than the blunt ugliness that usually characterizes the Trump campaign. The original MAGA hat is one of the most garish, unattractive objects ever manufactured, and it's hard to believe that the same minds that gave us that could also give us this.\n\nWe might never know whose brainchild these hats were, but we can attempt to ponder what they might actually mean. The hats, with their hat-within-a-hat concept, create a layer of distance between the wearer and the ugliness of Trump's politics-are they for the ironic Trump fan, the type that needs to tell themselves they're better than the other Trump voters? In thinking about the hats, I was reminded of a moment in a recent New York magazine article about the campaign (the article is now controversial for other reasons ) wherein Trump discusses a newly coined nickname for his opponent:\n\n\"Well, I have a name. You saw the new name?\" I had not seen it. \"Kamabla,\" he said. His communications director, Steven Cheung, who had said almost nothing for 57 minutes, piped up to say it too. \"Kamabla.\" Trump nodded. He gave me an expectant look, but I was confused. He repeated it again. \"Kamabla.\"\n\nAs with \"Kamabla,\" I'm not sure anyone at Trump HQ would be able to actually explain why the MAGA hat hats are funny. As with so much of what they do, probably no one thought about it that much. Smaller MAGA hat on a hat. Kamabla. Immigrants eating dogs. Yeah, sure, whatever, let's try it, maybe someone will buy it. It just so happens that, unlike Kamabla, the hats actually work. Can it really be explained? A broken clock is right twice a day; some spaghetti sticks to the wall. But maybe the hats also more revealing than even their originators realize.\n\nThe original MAGA hats date back to the 2016 presidential race, and the \"Make America Great Again\" slogan was about returning to some imagined version of an idyllic America. To the extent that that was ever a coherent idea, these hats deemphasize it. It's no longer about making America great-now it's all about recapturing the rush of 2016. Doesn't it seem like the Trump campaign is nostalgic for those good old days, when they were an upstart, energetic operation whose candidate actually seemed to want to be there? Are these hats a tell that they wish it was eight years ago? Maybe they're even an accidental tribute to an era they know is over, where the MAGA hat is sort of an angel over a heavenly white background: RIP, MAGA? We can only hope-and keep an eye out for the MAGA hat hat hat.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Collective Punishment\n\nPhoto by Russell Cheyne/Reuters,Paneikon\n\nDonald Trump announced his presidential campaign with an ugly tirade against Mexican immigrants-\"They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists.\"-that shot him to the top of the GOP polls. He's been there ever since, despite racism, sexism, and open disrespect for combat veterans. Now, Trump is the center of gravity in the Republican race for president, and his antics affect every candidate, from mainstream picks like Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, to more direct rivals like Scott Walker and Ted Cruz.\n\nOn Monday, his pull got a little stronger. Trump published his first set of proposals, a plan for immigration reform titled in the style of the candidate's signature slogan: \" Immigration Reform That Will Make America Great Again .\" Neither detailed nor precise, it still stands as the most comprehensive immigration plan yet released in the Republican presidential race. And together with Trump as its spokesman, the plan is poised to move the GOP conversation on immigration from simple restrictionism to something more punitive and cruel.\n\nDespite his rhetoric, Trump wouldn't deport unauthorized immigrants en masse. Instead, in line with Mitt Romney's \"self-deportation\" strategy from 2012, he would push \" attrition through enforcement \" to make life intolerable for unauthorized immigrants and their families.\n\nTo start, he would triple the number of immigration enforcement officers, and empower them with greater authority to track down and deport unauthorized immigrants across the country. His White House would ask Congress to defund \"sanctuary cities\" and create a nationwide \"e-verify\" system for employers. He would increase penalties for immigrants who overstay a visa, including criminal prosecution, and he would end \"birthright citizenship,\" a provision of the 14 th Amendment that gives automatic citizenship to anyone born in the United States and its territories. Originally written to overturn the Supreme Court's decision in Dred Scott , it now stands as a testament to American openness. And while Trump doesn't say that he would strip citizenship from the 4.5 million Americans born to unauthorized parents, many of them children, the implication is that he would. If so, it would be, as Ezra Klein notes for Vox , an astonishing act of collective punishment.\n\nAnd it continues. To pay for all of this-including a wall across the southern border of the United States-Trump would seize all remittance payments to Mexico (from both legal and unauthorized immigrants), increase fees on all temporary visas, border crossing cards, and NAFTA worker's visas, and raise tariffs on goods from Mexico. In addition, Trump would limit visas to high-skilled workers, and limit the number of refugees and asylum seekers who come to American shores. The overriding goal, again, is to keep new immigrants out of the country-regardless of status-and punish the ones that are already here.\n\nTrump might be a joke, but his plan is not. If implemented, it would bring tremendous suffering to millions of Americans-native-born, naturalized, or otherwise. But because it speaks to the Republican base-in a new CNN poll , 44 percent of self-described Republicans and Republican-leaning independents agree with Trump on \"illegal immigration\"-it's getting a fair hearing from serious conservatives.\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker said his immigration plan was \" similar \" to Trump's; that he would support building a wall along the Mexican border; and that he would consider \"changing the rules\" on birthright citizenship. Other candidates, like Bobby Jindal and Chris Christie, have echoed Trump's views on birthright citizenship. * Likewise, the editors of National Review called it a \" good start \" that's \"sensible in its basic outline and better in many respects than the ideas presented by his rivals.\"\n\nNearly three years ago, after the 2012 election, Republican leaders urged a new approach for the party on immigration. They urged inclusive rhetoric and policies to match. They didn't get far, and a grassroots backlash killed the GOP plan for reform. Now, with Trump, they've come full circle. Outreach and persuasion is out for good. Antagonism is the new plan.\n\nCorrection, Aug. 20, 2015: Due to an editing error, this article misstated that John Kasich echoed Trump's views on birthright citizenship. He did not. The reference to Kasich has been replaced with a comparison to Bobby Jindal, who did echo those views.

      "text": "What Do Trump Supporters Think About Climate Change? I Went to a Rally and Asked.\n\nRalph Freso/Getty Images\n\nAt the end of his hourlong dialogue Monday with the Washington Post 's editorial board, Donald Trump said \"our biggest form of climate change we should worry about is nuclear weapons.\" As Trumpish climate change howlers go, this was relatively informed and sober-minded. In the past, he has repeatedly called human-caused global warming a \" myth \" and a \" hoax .\" He once suggested that \"global warming was created by and for the Chinese,\" which he now says was just a joke.\n\nTrump lives in an unreality of his own making. But what about his supporters?\n\nOn Saturday, the Republican front-runner visited my town, Tucson, Arizona, so I decided to go out and chat with folks waiting in line to see him. In a dozen or so interviews-which are obviously in no way representative of the national electorate or even of Trump supporters in general-I found many Trump fans who disagree with him on climate.\n\nIf there's one thing I learned from the experience, it's that you absolutely cannot guess a person's views on climate change unless you ask him or her. About half of the respondents in my small sample size seemed to accept mainstream climate science-the climate is changing, and human activity is the primary cause. That might dismay some, but it's more than I was expecting. This was a Trump rally, remember.\n\nMy micro-sample accords with the gradually escalating alarm with which Americans view the issue. A recent Gallup poll found 65 percent of Americans now view human activity as the primary cause of global warming, the highest in Gallup's 16-year history of asking this question, with 40 percent of Republicans now saying they're worried a \"great deal/fair amount\" about the issue.\n\nTake the response of a man in Tucson wearing oversized Mardi Gras beads, flashing sunglasses, and an Uncle Sam hat with a turkey on it. I'd asked him, \"What are your thoughts on climate change?\" His quick response: \"It sucks.\" His companion, Karina Roberts, who was wearing a European football-style scarf with \"UNITED STATES\" in bold letters, went on to give a several-minute-long disquisition on why climate change deserved to be \"up there\" in the national conversation. \"In some ways, [Trump] may not be in line with climate change, which is just so important, but we can only hope that any of the candidates would put that ... on the top of the list, but there's so many things that need to be addressed as well,\" Roberts told me. \"At least, at a minimum, Mr. Trump is being able to do a lot of things without being bought.\" Still, if given the choice between a candidate who was in favor of climate action and one who wasn't, Roberts allowed that it could make the difference on whom to vote for.\n\nAnother attendee, John, seemed to support Trump specifically because he might take bold action on climate change. John told me \"climate change is obviously a topic we need to take incredibly seriously. If we don't take it incredibly seriously, the human race is going to find out really quickly what can happen.\" When asked where Trump fits in, he said, \"Well, Trump just seems like the kind of guy that once he decides what it is that needs to be done, then he'll put his best foot forward and try to accomplish it.\"\n\nOne Trump supporter, Wayne, said climate change has \"definitely been going on for a long time ... we caused it\" and was dismayed that the candidate is \"not as informed as he should be\" on climate. \"The enlightenment of the whole political agenda has to happen,\" he said, before we can expect leaders to break away from their connections to the oil industry that may be steering their views on climate.\n\nOne man, Eric, said he supports Trump for military reasons but seemed resigned to the issue of climate change: \"I don't really know, honestly, that there is much that we can do about that specifically-we've already had so much effect.\"\n\nOthers were more typically in line with views you might expect to encounter at a Trump rally. One man, Craig, when asked his thoughts on climate change, said \"there is none\" and then launched into claims that Al Gore created the threat as a hoax-not to mention that Gore still flies on airplanes. Another man, Ted, told me he thought there was a conspiracy among those who think humans have a strong role in climate change: \"It's questionable if it's even happening. I'm not saying it's not, but I've seen some things that it looks like it might be, but I don't know if it is or not. I like to make my own choices and see things and go from there.\" But he was clear that he didn't think humans were responsible. \"God is in charge of all of this stuff. We can do anything we can, but he could have destroyed us many times around. ... We have to have a balance of the environment and business.\"\n\nOne woman, Nancy, dressed in a neon-yellow shirt with hand-painted letters spelling \"Trump\" on it, was obviously a supporter. She confirmed this to me, interjecting, \"And I'm educated!\" When asked for her thoughts on climate change, she sighed and said, \"You really want to know? It's BS. I don't believe in it. I'm sorry. I just don't. It's been proven it's a bunch of hooey-that's my opinion.\" Feeling adventurous, I decided to follow up, asking if she agreed with Trump's past statements suggesting climate change was a hoax perpetrated by China to wreck our economy. \"Yes, they maneuver the currency, absolutely, 100 percent-and if anyone can deal with them, he's the guy.\"\n\nDespite these examples, most people I talked to seemed to be attending the rally out of a genuine desire to learn more about Trump's positions, though there were some that, of course, already had their minds made up. Take two friends, Lloyd and Nick, who were wearing \"Make America Great Again\" hats but said they were still \"on the fence\" as to whether they support Trump. \"We're here to see where the Trump supporters are at, we're middle ground right now,\" said Lloyd. On climate change, though, Lloyd was more certain: \"I think it's a big money grab, personally.\" His friend agreed: \"There's probably some kind of climate change that's happening, as far as the heat numbers and everything, but I do also agree that some people are taking advantage of that. ... I'm all about saving the environment and recycling and everything, but I feel like some people are really taking advantage of it.\"\n\nThe responses I encountered, even the more scientifically grounded ones, all seemed to reflect some element of the Trumpish mindset. There was the paranoia and the fear that someone foreign is getting one over on America. There was also the notion that, even if Trump says now that climate change is a hoax, he'll come around and fix everything eventually because he's a smart guy who Gets Things Done.\n\nStill, I came away from the experience with a gently buoyed faith in humanity. It was comforting in a weird way to find that Trump's appeal on this issue seems mostly a matter of affect, not policy. At least some of America is still in touch with reality.\n\nRead more Slate coverage of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Donald Trump today sets out to make America great again. But what if it was never great?\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe US has never been great for all of its people.\n\nby German Lopez\n\nInauguration Day is the first day of the Donald Trump presidency, when the celebrity-billionaire-turned-president begins his long promised journey to \"make America great again.\"\n\nDuring the campaign, there was a lot of debate about Trump's slogan. At the Republican convention , Trump and his ilk pushed the idea - with the obvious suggestion that the country was great before. At the Democratic convention , Hillary Clinton, the Obamas, and others argued that America is already great - and Trump could screw it all up.\n\nBut all of this, from the moment Trump uttered his slogan to the retorts by Democrats that followed, overlooked another possibility: America was never great.\n\nYes, this all hinges on how one defines \"great.\" But however you do that, it's hard to parse America's complicated history - particularly with systemic racism, exclusion of and violence against women, and its treatment of Native Americans - with almost any definition of greatness.\n\nThink of it this way: When was America great - for all of its inhabitants?\n\nIt's nearly impossible to give a good answer. No matter what period you think of, there is almost always something absolutely terrible happening. At the time of the country's founding? There was slavery, the ethnic cleansing of Native Americans, and the fact that women couldn't own property or vote. After the Civil War? Lynchings, race riots, and segregation. After World War II? Segregation, then the creation of a punitive justice system that disproportionately punishes minorities. The 1980s to today? The gap between white and black communities is still enormous - essentially the story of two worlds.\n\nThese periods may have been great for white, native-born men. But for everyone else? Not really.\n\nEven Trump, who says he wants to make America great again , can't give a very good answer for when America was great: When the New York Times asked him when the US had a proper balance in terms of its defense footprint and trade, he said , \"If you look back, it really was, there was a period of time when we were developing at the turn of the century which was a pretty wild time for this country and pretty wild in terms of building that machine, that machine was really based on entrepreneurship.\" He later cited the '40s and '50s more broadly as times in which America was in a great place.\n\nAgain, these are periods in which America felt great to white, US-born men. But think of it from the perspective of a black man in the South - forced into violent, impoverished neighborhoods, unable to vote due to discriminatory laws, scared of a sudden death sentence carried out by a mob if he has just one bad interaction with a white person. How could America have possibly been great back then, when so many of its people lived like this?\n\nImagine a country that has engaged in the enslavement of a large group of its people, and freed them only after a bloody civil war, only to oppress them in other ways - through mob killings, withholding their right to vote, segregation into impoverished communities, and a punitive criminal justice system. These big problems have persisted from this country's founding to its modern days. Even if this nation does a lot of other good, can it really make up for any of these crimes to be called \"great\"?\n\nJust try describing a country that knowingly allowed this chain of events, taken from a report by the Equal Justice Initiative , to happen as \"great\":\n\nIn 1904, after Luther Holbert allegedly killed a local white landowner, he and a black woman believed to be his wife were captured by a mob and taken to Doddsville, Mississippi, to be lynched before hundreds of white spectators. Both victims were tied to a tree and forced to hold out their hands while members of the mob methodically chopped off their fingers and distributed them as souvenirs. Next, their ears were cut off. Mr. Holbert was then beaten so severely that his skull was fractured and one of his eyes was left hanging from its socket. Members of the mob used a large corkscrew to bore holes into the victims' bodies and pull out large chunks of \"quivering flesh,\" after which both victims were thrown onto a raging fire and burned. The white men, women, and children present watched the horrific murders while enjoying deviled eggs, lemonade, and whiskey in a picnic-like atmosphere.\n\nOr this:\n\nIn 1889, in Aberdeen, Mississippi, Keith Bowen allegedly tried to enter a room where three white women were sitting; though no further allegation was made against him, Mr. Bowen was lynched by the \"entire (white) neighborhood\" for his \"offense.\" General Lee, a black man, was lynched by a white mob in 1904 for merely knocking on the door of a white woman's house in Reevesville, South Carolina; and in 1912, Thomas Miles was lynched for allegedly inviting a white woman to have a cold drink with him.\n\nOr this:\n\nIn 1940, Jesse Thornton was lynched in Luverne, Alabama, for referring to a white police officer by his name without the title of \"mister.\" In 1919, a white mob in Blakely, Georgia, lynched William Little, a soldier returning from World War I, for refusing to take off his Army uniform. White men lynched Jeff Brown in 1916 in Cedarbluff, Mississippi, for accidentally bumping into a white girl as he ran to catch a train.\n\nWhat's described in these accounts is not merely a few white people getting out of control. It's white vigilante mobs working with their government - which either turned a blind eye or actually helped the mobs - to terrorize black people and rob them of their hopes for safe, free lives. And it happened many, many times: The EJI report found lynchings of black Americans by white mobs in the South claimed nearly 4,000 lives between 1877 and 1950 - and that's only the lynchings we know of in the South. To put that in context, that's close to twice the number of black Americans who were murdered during all of 2014.\n\nIf this happened in any other country, would you be able to consider that nation great, even if it did some good? If you found out that local, state, and national governments in Canada were allowing and aiding lawless mobs in murdering the people of a certain race, would you ever consider Canada a great country?\n\nEven these atrocities are only a small sampling of the systemic racism and sexism that's plagued America for its existence. There was the massive ethnic cleansing of Native Americans - such as the Trail of Tears - from the country's founding through the 19th century. White women couldn't vote across the US until 1920 - and black women, along with black Americans in the South more broadly, didn't really have a guarantee to the right to vote until the Voting Rights Act of 1965 .\n\nDuring World War II, America forcibly put Japanese Americans into internment camps out of racist fears that they were all traitors in the war against Japan. Rape and domestic abuse - crimes in which women are the common victims - weren't treated as serious crimes on a national scale until the 1990s . Consensual gay sex was criminalized in at least some parts of the country until the early 2000s .\n\nThe list could really go on, but you should get the idea.\n\nThese weren't small acts. These were horrific acts of oppression, abuse, and murder. And they happened time and time again in the US. This isn't about a single bad period in American history - it's about the recurring theme of America's story.\n\nEmblematic of this is the \"city upon a hill\" speech that so many Americans first heard of through Ronald Reagan's farewell address , which set up a hopeful vision of the future of America. But as Reagan said, the phrase traces its American origins to John Winthrop's \"Model of Christian Charity\" sermon. As Rebecca Traister explained for New York magazine , this is the man who set the ideal image for America, and yet:\n\nWinthrop was one of our earliest elected leaders, serving 12 years as the governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. A wealthy Englishman, he held Native American slaves, and both of his sons held black slaves; he even helped write the first law in America sanctioning the practice. In 1648, Winthrop also presided over the trial and conviction of the first American woman to be hanged for witchcraft, Margaret Jones, a Puritan midwife.\n\nAs Traister noted, \"This is America, before America was even America.\"\n\nIt is true that America has vastly improved over time. Slavery is gone. Government-sanctioned segregation is (at least in theory) banned. Black Americans and women have the right to vote. Many Americans now look at Japanese internment and the country's treatment of Native Americans with total horror. LGBTQ people are more welcome in America today than just 10 years ago.\n\nThe country has also exerted its economic and military dominance for a global good, establishing a world order that has led to the most peaceful time in human history .\n\nBut for all this, America is still plagued by some very big problems. For one, it doesn't seem like the country has even fully repented for some of its racist crimes. Some still deny that those were truly horrific crimes at all, or downplay how bad they were. For example, after Michelle Obama pointed out at the 2016 Democratic convention that slaves built the White House, Fox News host Bill O'Reilly said that the slaves \"were well-fed and had decent lodgings provided by the government.\" (For more on this sort of thing, read a plantation tour guide's account .)\n\nHow can a country that can't even repent for its past crimes ever rise out of them into greatness?\n\nAs a result, systemic racism is still very much a reality in the US. Black Americans are much more likely to be incarcerated than their white counterparts, and black people get locked up longer than white people for the same crimes. Black Americans are also still effectively forced into neighborhoods that destroy their chances of a life equal to their white peers. Native Americans suffer from similar disparities.\n\nOne statistic that speaks to this: For every 100 black women not in prison, there are only 83 black men, according to a New York Times analysis . This amounts to 1.5 million black men missing from society under the shadow of mass incarceration. They're men who could be workers, fathers, artists, and so on - but are disproportionately locked up by a system that does little, according to research , to effectively fight crime and has made America the world's leader in incarceration .\n\nBut it's not just mass incarceration; the criminal justice system also under and overpolices black neighborhoods. Here is how journalist Jill Leovy described the criminal justice system's treatment of black Americans in her insightful book Ghettoside :\n\nLike the schoolyard bully, our criminal justice system harasses people on small pretexts but is exposed as a coward before murder. It hauls masses of black men through its machinery but fails to protect them from bodily injury and death. It is at once oppressive and inadequate.\n\nSome statistics to this end: In New York City, for instance, 86 percent of 2013 homicides involving a white victim were solved, compared to 45 percent of those involving a black victim, according to an analysis by the New York Daily News. And David Kennedy, a criminologist at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, told Mother Jones that in minority communities, clearance rates for murders and nonfatal shootings can get \"pathetically low. They can easily fall down to single digits.\"\n\nSo on the one hand, you have a criminal justice system that tasks police officers with harassing and brutalizing black people for small crimes - drugs , untaxed cigarettes , failing to signal when changing lanes , and so on. On the other hand, the system turns a blind eye to serious crimes that warrant serious policing attention in black communities. It's a system that at once incriminates black people and fails to keep them and their communities safe.\n\nAll across the country, states are also passing new voting restrictions that appear to target black Americans' ability to vote. A federal court recently ruled against one of these laws, from North Carolina , finding that the law intentionally discriminated after North Carolina's lawyers suggested that the state had to cut some early voting days because black voters benefited too much from them. (This really happened .)\n\nThe systemic disparities go as far as people's personal health. In a recent conversation , David Williams , a public health researcher at Harvard, put the racial gap between white and black life expectancy to me in stark, telling terms:\n\nOne of the ways to think of the racial gap in health is to think of how many black people die prematurely every year who wouldn't die if there were no racial differences in health. The answer to that from a carefully done [2001] scientific study is 96,800 black people die prematurely every year. Divide it by 365 [days], that's 265 people dying prematurely every day. Imagine a jumbo jet - with 265 passengers and crew - crashing at Reagan Washington Airport today, and the same thing happening tomorrow and every day next week and every day next month. That's what we're talking about when we say there are racial disparities in health.\n\nOne catch is the white and black life expectancy has closed since the study Williams cited. Still, a big gap remains, leading to tens of thousands more deaths each year in the US. In America, you are doomed to die younger just because you're black.\n\nThis is only the beginning of the many disparities black people face. There are also many enormous economic gaps between people of different races: According to 2014 data, while white Americans have a median household income of $60,250, black Americans have a median household income nearly half of that - at $35,400.\n\nIs a country that allows significant segments of its population to languish like this - and even sets policies that create these circumstances - really great?\n\nThen there are the disparities between men and women. On average, women make 79 cents for every dollar men make for full-time work. Women still are not proportionally represented in any state or national legislatures. Rape on college campuses is only now beginning to get the serious attention it deserves . Women politicians still get regularly questioned and criticized over how they speak and what they wear . America is the only developed country without paid parental leave, making it exceptionally hard for moms - especially low-wage, single mothers - to raise children and keep a job at the same time.\n\nAgain, is this great?\n\nMuch of this depends on how you define great. For some Americans, particularly white men, America certainly feels great - it's made them generally prosperous and able to live luxurious lives. I would say America has also been great for me - as a Latino immigrant from a relatively wealthy family, it's offered me opportunities that I wouldn't have had in my birth country, Venezuela .\n\nBut America isn't like this for many - this is a country in which people live in poverty, fearful of police , mass incarceration , and gun violence . Trying to leave this out to apply a label like \"great\" to America whitewashes the abhorrent conditions faced by so many of its people. (One question you might have: Is any country great under this definition? I'm honestly not sure, but I don't think so.)\n\nWhat's more, there appears to be a huge segment of the population that in fact wants such disparities to persist.\n\nConsider Donald Trump. This is a man who has said very clearly racist and sexist things - both in the past and on the campaign trail. And yet he won the election. As much as the Clintons and Obamas would like to suggest that Trump's hateful vision isn't the America they know, it's apparently the America that enough Americans were willing to embrace to send Trump to the White House.\n\nObama himself acknowledged this in an interview with Marc Maron : \"The legacy of slavery, Jim Crow, discrimination in almost every institution of our lives - you know, that casts a long shadow. And that's still part of our DNA that's passed on. We're not cured of it.\"\n\nNone of this is to say that America is bad. There is a large gap between bad and great - and America surely falls in between once you add up all its positives and negatives.\n\nCrucially, the country is also bound to get better. As Bill Clinton said in 1993, \"There's nothing wrong with America that can't be fixed by what's right with America.\"\n\nThe US has many historical advantages going for it - its embrace of democracy, its ideal to be a melting pot for the world's races and cultures, its economic and military power, and a world order it helped establish that's led to the most peaceful time in world history. In the future, as the country becomes more diverse , it will likely move in a better direction. It may even become great.\n\nBut to claim the mantle of greatness now, when the US's recent history and current status are plagued by horrific acts of racism, is a step too far. America may be great someday, but it has never been there and is not there just yet.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nA historian on Trump's primal appeal\n\nby Sean Illing\n\nBack in September, I spoke with Mark Lilla, a political theorist and historian of ideas at Columbia University. He had just published a book titled The Shipwrecked Mind , a short meditation on the rise of political reactionaries.\n\nOf all the conversations I've had about this election, the one with Lilla now stands out.\n\nTo the surprise of many, myself included, Donald Trump was elected president of the United States last night, and we have to reckon with that fact.\n\nTrump's appeal isn't reducible to any one thing. But Lilla, more than anyone else, touched on something fundamental, something difficult to measure.\n\nThe thesis of his book was simple enough: For at least two centuries, Western politics has been shaped by the forces of revolution. But the revolutionary fervor has given way to something equally potent, what Lilla calls the reactionary spirit.\n\nLike the revolutionary, the reactionary forsakes the present - only she does it not in defense of some future vision but out of a nostalgia for the past. Such an orientation, Lilla argues, is dangerous because it's fueled by an irrefutable narrative about a lost golden age.\n\nNostalgia is ostensibly about the past, but what animates it is a fear of the present and, perhaps more importantly, the future.\n\nIf Trump supporters have anything in common, it's a vague belief in yesterday. They want to make America great again , which is to say they want to relive what they imagine was a better time, a better world.\n\nThe question is, what is it about the present that they're rejecting? And what was so great about this imagined past? These questions don't admit of easy answers, but there are plenty of clues. Race, no doubt, has a lot to do with it.\n\nHere's what we know: Yesterday, millions of Americans elected a buffoonish dilettante, a man with no ideas, no political experience, and no understanding of the world he wants to lead.\n\nWorse still, he put fascism on the ballot, and half of America's voters said \"Yes.\"\n\nMake no mistake: this is a crisis. Trump's campaign represents a rejection of our democratic norms. The depth of that rejection, and the rage bubbling beneath it, has yet to be understood. But there is no doubt that Trump won on the backs of white, working-class rural voters who responded to his bile and his bigotry and his false promises.\n\nMy conversation with Lilla, re-posted below, helps to clarify what we witnessed yesterday, or at least it helps to clarify one dimension of the Trump phenomenon.\n\nIt was insightful at the time. Today, in the wake of the most cataclysmic political event of my lifetime, it takes on a renewed significance.\n\nThe title of your book is The Shipwrecked Mind . That's a colorful metaphor - what are you getting at?\n\nWell, it's a very old metaphor to think of time as a river. This goes back to ancient mythology. In thinking about that metaphor, I started thinking about what it would be like to feel as though the current of time was passing you by. The idea that somehow you're stuck somewhere while things are moving on and feeling cut off from a place you left, unable to get back to the river and dreaming of either going back or jumping ahead and creating a new and better future.\n\nThat's an old metaphor, but it captures something new or ascendant in our politics. In the book, you say the revolutionary spirit that inspired political movements for nearly two centuries has faded, but the reactionary spirit is very much alive and equally potent. Can you explain?\n\nThe revolutionary spirit was born out of a hope in a particular kind of revolution that would be both predictable and good. It was a means to something better, something transformative. But 20th-century experience seems to have undercut those assumptions.\n\nReactionaries, I argue, are nostalgic. They're thinking about a past that's been lost, and that past is always there. You may lose hope in a particular picture of the future, but you have a picture of the past that's untouchable, which is why I say in the book, \"Hopes can be extinguished but nostalgia is irrefutable.\"\n\nIt's only when revolutionary fervor has us scared that we see this so clearly, but in fact, if you weren't buying into the revolutionary myths of the 19th and 20th century, if you were paying attention and didn't assume that it was going to sweep all things with it, you would have seen that the spirit of reaction was as strong. Certainly in parts of the 19th century, it was much stronger than the spirit of revolution. The 19th-century story in Europe is really about the resistance to the revolution, I think even more than the attempt to fulfill it and defend it.\n\n\"People all over are feeling displaced. ... So it's quite natural that unless there's a picture of the future that is compelling before them, they're going to feel an urge to return to something that they believe is familiar.\"\n\nI'm trying to think about this distinction in the context of our current political drama. What's interesting to me is how little ideology has to do with Trump's popularity. His campaign is largely a negation - of the present, of the direction of the country, of the establishment. That Trump has virtually no solutions or plan for the future seems to be an afterthought to his supporters.\n\nYeah, well, one of the things fueling reactionary thinking and the reactionary mood not only here but in Europe and the developing world, the postcolonial world, is a sense of displacement. The idea that all the changes wrought by a global economy and the Internet and mass migration will undermine our culture. People all over are feeling displaced, and it's an unfamiliar setting. So it's quite natural that unless there's a picture of the future that is compelling before them, they're going to feel an urge to return to something that they believe is familiar.\n\nDo you think people are on some level rejecting a world that they feel has passed them by?\n\nThe things that we read most seem to suggest that. There's a white middle class in this country that certainly feels that way, fairly or not. Why relatively young men who are working in cubicles and earning a decent salary feel that way, I don't know. Certainly just the idea of making America great again is obviously compelling.\n\nWhat makes Trump difficult to fit into or equate with some of the other present and past reactionary movements and leaders is that those leaders succeeded by offering a precise picture of what it would be like either to reconstruct the past or to hop into a future that would overcome the problems of the present though a rebirth of something in the past in a kind of hyper- or postmodern form - fascism, for example, offered that.\n\nTrump's message is: \"Insert your ad here.\" And he's succeeded because of that. What makes him interesting to me in this regard is that revolutionary prophets are always vague on intent. If you go back to the 19th century and look at the utopian socialists like Saint-Simon, they'd labor over details of what the future society would look like - what the cities would look like, how labor would be divided, etc. But the more details you got, the more absurd it looked. All Marx and Engels had to say was, you should be able to fish in the morning and criticize in the afternoon and enjoy dinner in the evening, and that was enough.\n\nTrump, in a way, is being vague like successful revolutionaries have been in the past, and that makes him different from, say, the Taliban on the one hand and fascism on the other. It's the openness of the message, and it's an interesting psychological test of a population whether they respond without things being precise or whether in fact they respond more if things are not precise.\n\nIt's part of the brilliance of his campaign: He's a kind of political Rorschach test. By being so vacuous, people can project whatever they want or need to project onto him.\n\nOf course that assumes that the people we're asking are to be taken seriously. I think something very different is going on, and that is that people just don't give a damn and they don't take seriously the responsibility to be informed about things and to make choices.\n\nThat has something to do with the broader problems in our political system, but it also has to do with the reigning libertarianism in our society, with the selfishness of people who turn away from politics into the cocoon of their private life.\n\nI've been trying to explain to people who don't live here what's going on, and there are two ways of looking at it. One is that the people who are voting for Trump are serious people who have real grievances and we need to understand those grievances in order to respond to them.\n\nThe other idea is these people don't have ideas, they don't have common sense. They've checked out of politics, and their support has to be understood in that way. So there's this big question mark for me in terms of how to understand this phenomenon.\n\nI suspect there's a bit of truth in both of those views. In any event, I want to talk about the major themes of your book. I'm struck by the role of narrative in your broader accounts of revolutionary and reactionary orientations.\n\nThe revolutionary treats the present as a means to some future utopia. The reactionary sees the past in all its splendor and wants to relive it. In both cases, however, it's present experience that seems least important.\n\nOh, I couldn't agree with you more. It's the unwillingness to live within the envelope of what the present gives you. This is what liberalism at its best does: It lowers your expectations for politics; it forces you to take responsibility for mastering what's going on in the present and urges you to think about what is ameliorating problems rather than wiping the slate clean.\n\nWe're creatures built for escape, and we try to escape ourselves psychologically in so many ways, and it's a natural tendency to want to escape the present rather than think it through when there are moments of crisis and dislocation.\n\nIn a previous life, I taught political theory, and I was very taken by Albert Camus's critique of revolutionary ideologies. His objection was that they were totalizing narratives that obscured present experience in dangerous ways. The belief, for example, that history had a direction or some higher meaning led to the justification of crimes in the name of future progress.\n\nYes, and this comes not only from Camus but also from someone like Reinhold Niebuhr, the famous American theologian, who similarly worried about our inability to accept that we're fallen creatures. The revolutionary assumes that we're not fallen creatures, that we're made wicked by virtue of our social conditions. Thus, if we change social conditions, we can improve human nature.\n\nThe debate is really over how fallen human beings are, and to what degrees society can change things. There are all sorts of other things, of course. But the nostalgic reactionary shares the picture of the revolutionary that somehow history has twisted human nature.\n\nWhile the revolutionary thinks that we've yet to become what we were meant to be, the reactionary believes we once were who we're supposed to be and we've departed from our nature.\n\nYou claim that political Islamists, European nationalists, and the American right all tell their ideological children essentially the same tale, which is that there was a moment at which history split and, for whatever reason, things went sideways and human nature and society were corrupted. Can you say a bit more about this grand narrative?\n\nWell, two things. One is that you could tell the story of the shipwreck and say we need to withdraw from political life in a kind of monastic impulse and keep alive the old forms of life pushed away by history. You can treat it as if it's fate.\n\nWhat the reactionary believes is that there was an agent of change, that it was not just fate, and that it's possible to pinpoint exactly who the agents were and exactly the time when history broke in two. Once you do that, you know what kind of enemy you have and you know what your role is as the fading remnant.\n\nIn the modern world, anti-intellectualism is essential to the forces of reaction. Because it's possible to blame all these changes on the articulate class. You then appeal to people who are not articulate, and you make them feel that while they may not be able to argue with their adversaries, they have a kind of preliterate virtue that literacy and intellectual life has robbed them of. Then a kind of holy ignorance emerges, which is a sign that you are the saving remnant.\n\nThis is something very important in American politics. Take something like neoconservatism, which began as a movement of intellectuals trying to essentially hold on to a Roosevelt understanding of liberalism as opposed to a McGovernite ideal of liberalism. There was a sense, after the tumult of the '60s, that you needed a more intellectual effort in order to explain the world and make sense of it.\n\nIt was about becoming more intellectual about these things, but then neoconservatism went through this demonic marriage with populism and suddenly the ordinary American, the ordinary guy, became this fount of wisdom because he's been untouched by these ideas that are corrupting our virtue.\n\nNeoconservatism ties in with another question I had for you. There's a fascinating chapter in the book on Leo Strauss, the intellectual godfather of neoconservatism. Reading it, I couldn't help but think of Nietzsche.\n\nStrauss believed that societies needed an authoritative account of ultimate values in order to legitimate their political institutions. Nietzsche warned at the end of the 19th century that the collapse of metaphysics would lead to a crisis of authority; that our highest values would be exposed as relative and contingent. The result, he argued, would be an era of ideological battles, where political religions would replace traditional religions as competing sources of meaning and order in human life. How does modern reactionary politics fit into this account?\n\nThese are the kinds of stories that are used by reactionaries in order to build up their historical myth. It's a story about a loss of clarity, a loss of moral authority. It's interesting to think about the way both Straussianism and neoconservatism developed through the '60s, through the '70s, through the '80s and the '90s. The first prophecy we heard is that no society can exist if these foundational myths are questioned.\n\nThe problem then became the apocalyptic neoconservatives. It turned out the problem was not that society couldn't go on without these myths; it was that it could. Societies can live without these things, or they can replace one set of fundamental truths with a different one. What bothered neoconservatives is not that society has lost its moral presuppositions, it's that those presuppositions have changed.\n\nSo there came a moment in the late '80s and early '90s when certain neoconservatives threw in the towel and said American society has become hopeless.\n\nDo you buy Strauss's claim that modern liberalism, insofar as it abolishes transcendent standards, was destined to decline into negation and relativism?\n\nNo, because it turns out it doesn't descend into relativism. What you have is a new kind of morality that isn't relativistic so much as more tolerant. This becomes the new dogma. It's not that we've lost an underlying dogma - it simply changed.\n\nThen the question is, what kind of lives are people actually living? Are they living good lives, or aren't they? Are they still public-spirited, or aren't they? Then you can ask serious questions about whether this kind of liberalism as opposed to an earlier kind of liberalism is healthy for individuals or whether it weakens the machine in a sense that people become too privatized and won't do their their duties. It's not that there's no longer a morality. The question is does the morality we have undercut the kinds of commitments required to have a republic.\n\nHow concerned are you about the rise of right-wing populism both here and across Europe? As you know, there are plenty of historical analogues to this, and none of them inspire hope.\n\nI see the populism as a symptom of many things, not the cause. I think what it's revealed is that the party systems that were developed after World War II no longer function. No country knows how to fund political parties anymore because people don't adhere to parties, and that's because the cleavages between the parties no longer match the cleavages that are in society.\n\nSo you have political cleavages and tensions existing below the party structures. The pressing question for me is not what will happen with populism but whether there will be some kind of transformation within the party systems so that they are able again both to respond to some of these concerns and do what parties are supposed to do: build coalitions and consensus and focus on policy solutions.\n\nDo you think the party structure in this country is sufficiently pliable to accommodate or absorb these changes, and if not, what becomes of it?\n\nWell, we're going to find out. After the election, win or lose, the Trump phenomenon has really put the ball in the court of the right. There's talk of starting new parties. There are talks about how to recapture the GOP. There's clearly going to be a fight to decide the future of the party. Who knows what becomes of that.\n\nThe other fact to recognize and to see in Trump's success is that people want to hear that the government is going to respond to some of the problems that they're having, and that requires a new kind of thinking.\n\nYou may be right about the need for a new kind of thinking, but I'm not sanguine about what that would look like or whether our system can adapt quickly enough. More than anything else, people have lost faith in the authority of governing institutions, and that's a very dangerous place to be.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

      "text": "How \"America First\" ruined the \"American dream\"\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nAuthor Sarah Churchwell on the entangled history of America's most loaded phrases.\n\nby Sean Illing\n\n\"From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this moment on, it's going to be America First.\"\n\nThat's how President Donald Trump summed up his governing philosophy during his inaugural address last January. The phrase \"America First\" has been a feature of Trump's rhetorical shtick since he began campaigning for the White House, but the phrase itself has a long and troubling backstory.\n\nSarah Churchwell is a professor of American literature and humanities at the University of London, and the author of new book titled Behold, America . It's a timely survey of two of the most loaded phrases in the American lexicon: \"America First\" and \"American dream,\" and how they've evolved in opposition to each other.\n\nIn this interview, we discuss that evolution and what these century-old slogans have meant to the people who have co-opted them. Language matters, Churchwell argues, and the words we use carry their own historical baggage, whether we're aware of it or not.\n\nIn the case of America First, that history is dark but also deeply instructive. And in the case of the American dream, it's a history that needs to be understood afresh if we want to reclaim it's original meaning.\n\nA lightly edited transcript of our conversation follows.\n\nLet's start with \"America First,\" a phrase our current president has frequently used to sum up his worldview. Where does this phrase come from?\n\nIt was a Republican campaign slogan in the 1880s, which means it appeared much earlier than most people think. But it didn't become a national catchphrase until President Woodrow Wilson used it in 1915. He was using it to try to keep America out of the first World War. But he was kind of doing a tap dance, because he wanted to placate the isolationists, although he was himself an internationalist.\n\nSo Wilson was using America First as a way to maneuver his way through a political minefield by saying America would be first to lead the world, and that it should stay neutral so it could pick up the pieces in Europe after the war. It was ostensibly about maintaining neutrality in the name of leadership.\n\nBut then the phrase gets taken up in the name of isolationism almost instantly, and it is quickly connected with other ideas that were also on the rise at the time, especially the rise of the Ku Klux Klan. It became linked to anti-immigration movements, and sympathizers of fascism, and was popularized by Charles Lindbergh, the famous American pilot who lead the \"America First Committee\" - a group of some 800,000 Americans who wanted to keep us out of WWII.\n\n\"Trump represents a strain of American thinking that goes back a long, long way\"\n\nSo it began as an antiwar isolationist slogan, and then morphed into an explicitly xenophobic and fascist slogan?\n\nYeah, and it happened pretty predictably. If you're in an anti-immigrant and xenophobic debate, then \"America First\" will kind of magnetically accrue those anti-immigrant sentiments. Put America first, native-born people first. It connects back to the nativism of the 1840s and 1850s, and it sounds broadly anti-immigrant. In a moment where people were very concerned about waves of immigration, which was a big motivating force for the KKK, it was only natural that America First would become a rallying cry for nativists and racists.\n\nTo be clear, who did the America First-ers want to keep out?\n\nAnybody who's not white, not Protestant, not what they saw as a native-born American, an old-style American. And that was their notion of what America was supposed to be.\n\nSo America First did have very strong resonances with ideals like \"Make America Great Again,\" which was a phrase that they nearly echoed as well. The idea then, as now, was that the true version of America is the America that looks like me, the American fantasy I imagine existed before it was diluted with other races and other people.\n\nAmerica First spoke directly and powerfully to that segment of white America that felt they were losing their power, their dominance. It was a way of saying me first, only my version of America should be allowed to have any sway here.\n\nYou have to remember, too, that there was this notion at the time of \"100 percent American,\" which meant 100 percent Anglo Saxon blood. And that coincided with the so-called one-drop rule, which was an old racist rule in America in which one drop of black blood made someone legally black and therefore subject to slavery or Jim Crow or miscegenation laws . So all of these ideas were used interchangeably, and they folded neatly into the America First movement.\n\nI want to pivot to this idea of the \"American dream,\" which intersects with the America First movement.\n\nSo the American dream, as initially conceived, was very much rooted in a working-class social democratic aspiration for equality and upward mobility, but you describe how this notion was gradually co-opted and turned upside down. What happened?\n\nWe associate this phrase with ideas of free market capitalism and with conversations on the right about individual opportunity and liberty and all this small government stuff.\n\nBut when you search for the origins of the phrase \"American dream,\" it turns out it emerged on the progressive left to argue the opposite side of the case - to say that unchecked capitalism and huge increases in private wealth would destroy the American dream of opportunity, because of inequality.\n\nThe meaning of the phrase started to change after WWII. The newfound emphasis on individual economic liberty was in tension with the idea of justice for all, and this became more of a problem as economic inequality increased and the spoils of capitalism were restricted to a privileged few later in the century.\n\nSo what we had was a series of debates as the country tried to keep liberty and justice in some kind of uneasy equilibrium, but ultimately the emphasis on individual liberty and free market capitalism trumped everything else.\n\nIn the book, you talk about how these two phrases, \"America First\" and the \"American dream,\" naturally collided and came to represent the struggle between liberal democracy and authoritarian fascism.\n\nWell, the collision was inevitable, especially when America First shifted from an isolationist slogan to an explicitly nativist, white nationalist slogan.\n\nEarly on, the American dream was being used all the way up to WWII as a way to describe not free market capitalism, but the rights of everybody within a democratic society, and the dreams of America for fairness and self-government. Those ideas were bound to collide with the America First movement.\n\nWhat I found so interesting was that people were speaking of the American dream as a concept that had racial equality built into it, that was inimical to anti-Semitism and other kinds of bigotries or racial prejudices, as early as the 1930s.\n\nMost people would say that we first started to have a conversation about social justice related to the American dream with Martin Luther King in 1963, but people were arguing this from at least as early as the 1930s, and saying if this anti-Semitic America First thing starts to take hold, it will be the death of the American dream. Racial injustice would be the death of the American dream.\n\nWhen you hear President Donald Trump declare the American dream dead and promise to put America first, what do you think?\n\nI think it would be good if we all read more history. Trump's version of the American dream is a cartoon version from the 1950s, when guys like him had it really good, even better than today. But other people are pushing back, and saying you can't dominate everybody, and Trump feeds into this resentment and he has unleashed it as well as anyone.\n\nAnd when he says he's going to put America first, he specifically means this vision of America first. His advisors know this stuff. Steve Bannon knows this stuff. Bannon has read history, and he uses phrases like \" economic nationalism \" which were also associated with America First in the 1920s. It's not a coincidence.\n\nThey chose the phrase \"America First\" pretty late in the campaign, and it seem pretty deliberate. Donald Trump didn't stumble on it. One of the things I talk about in the book is that Trump was very well aware of what it meant, at least in the 1990s when he talked about it in relation to Pat Buchanan's campaign , and called Buchanan an anti-Semite and said that he was using the phrase to curry favor with the right-wing wacko nut jobs, which he obviously decided was a good tactic in 2016.\n\n\"America First spoke directly and powerfully to that segment of white America that felt they were losing their power, their dominance\"\n\nTrump personifies one side of the moral and political tension this book describes, and maybe that's the most important fact about his political existence - that there is nothing new about him or what he represents, that he is simply the latest expression of a core feature of the American psyche.\n\nI totally agree with that. Indeed, I wanted this book to make that very point. Trump represents a strain of American thinking that goes back a long, long way, and the debate we're having now about what kind of country we want to live in, and who has the right to be here, is hardly new.\n\nWe've always been divided and we've also been divided along exactly these lines. And at that moment, the side that wants America to go backward, to include fewer people, is in the ascendancy, and it's important that we recognize that and realize that we've been here before, and that nothing is inevitable.\n\nIf knowledge of history is truly emancipatory, and I think it is, what does knowledge of this history - the history of America First and the American dream - emancipate us from?\n\nWell, it emancipated me from the belief that the American dream was always what we say it is today. It used to be so much bigger, so much more inclusive, and the version we inherited isn't the original version or the most inspiring or just version. It reminded me that our aspirations can be bigger and better, and that the story of America can always change.\n\nKnowing history also has a way of clarifying the fight you're in. It's important to know what America First means and what it represents, because that's what we're up against right now, and it's a very old fight. So in a way, it's liberating to know that, to know that the struggle is ongoing and has to be continually waged.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

      "text": "President Trump's inauguration speech, annotated\n\nShortly after taking the oath to become the 45th president of the United States, Donald Trump delivered an inaugural address to hundreds of thousands of onlookers in Washington.\n\nThe speech, which aired on C-SPAN and every major broadcast and cable news network, sought to rally the nation behind an \"America-first\" populist vision. Here is a full transcript of that speech, with annotations from reporters across the Vox.com newsroom.\n\nChief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans, and people of the world, thank you.\n\nWe, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and restore its promise for all of our people. Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come.\n\nWe will face challenges. We will confront hardships, but we will get the job done. Every four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power. And we are grateful to President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition. They have been magnificent. Thank you.\n\nToday's ceremony however, has very special meaning, because today, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another, but we are transferring power from Washington, DC, and giving it back to you, the people.\n\nFor too long, [thoseÂ in politics] have reaped the rewards of government while people have borne the cost. Washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth.\n\nPoliticians prospered, but the jobs left and the factories closed . The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country. Their victories have not been your victories. Their triumphs have not been your triumphs and while they celebrated in our nation's capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.\n\nThis line clearly speaks to how many people feel, but in reality there are more people employed in the United States in January 2017 than at any previous time in American history, and inflation-adjusted wages are higher than they have ever been.\n\nMatthew Yglesias , @mattyglesias\n\nThat all changes starting right here and right now, because this moment is your moment. It belongs to you. It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America. This is your day. This is your celebration. And this, the United States of America, is your country.\n\nBecause what truly matters is not what truly controls our government but whether our government is controlled by the people. January 20, 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again.\n\nThe forgotten men and women of our country Â will be forgotten no longer. Everyone is listening to you now. You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement, the likes of which the world has never seen before.\n\nTrump only uses the word âwomenâ twice, once here and once in reference to the âmen and women of our military.â Both references are to âmen and women.â He also mentions âMothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner citiesâ (and âinner citiesâ has been a problematic phrase Â for Trump when it comes to race relations). Either way, itâs interesting that he never specifically talks about womenâs issues after a campaign that was so strongly defined by gender on both sides.\n\nEmily Crockett , @emilycrockett\n\nAt the center of this movement is a crucial conviction, that a nation exists to serve its citizens. Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families,Â and good jobs for themselves. These are just and reasonable demands of righteous people and a righteous public. But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists.\n\nMothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities , rusted-out factories, scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation , an education system flush with cash but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge\n\nTwo things worth noting here. Trump often paints a blighted picture of poverty in âinner cities,â but there are more poor people in American suburbs Â than in urban centers. And Trumpâs proposed policies are far more likely to worsen poverty , including among children, than improve it.\n\nLibby Nelson , @libbyanelson\n\nThis is a clear expression of Trump's economic nostalgia and promises of a very particular type of renewal, but it's more evocative than it is true, in a macro sense. There are certainly rusted-out factories in America, but the United States has never enjoyed larger manufacturing output than it does today.\n\nJim Tankersley , @jimtankersley\n\nThe United States spends more per student Â than nearly all developed countries (although most public schools probably wouldnât describe themselves as âflush with cash,â given that many teachers have to crowdfund Â books and supplies for their classrooms). As for âdeprived of all knowledge,â American studentsâ scores on international tests Â arenât great compared with other developed countries â about average on math and science, below average in math â but itâs a bit harsh to say they know nothing.\n\nLibby Nelson , @libbyanelson\n\nÂ And the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential. This American carnage Â stops right here and stops right now.\n\nâAmerican carnageâ is the early favorite as âline of the speech.â\n\nJim Tankersley , @jimtankersley\n\nWe are one nation,Â and their pain is our pain. Their dreams are our dreams,Â and their success will be our success. We share one heart, one home,Â and one glorious destiny.\n\nThe oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans.\n\nFor many decades, we have enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry, subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military.\n\nTrump is in a literal sense correct Â here: Under the Obama administration, the Pentagonâs budget and the size of the armed forces have both shrunk. But Trump ignores that some of those cuts came because of Republican-mandated spending limits, while others were the natural result of Obama winding down the long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nYochi Dreazen , @yochidreazen\n\nWe have defended other nations' borders while refusing to defend our own , and spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.\n\nThe federal government hasn't \"refused\" to defend the US/Mexico border; to the contrary . But some Border Patrol agents were so frustrated by Obama's policies that they became unwilling to apprehend immigrants crossing the border. They've been some of Trump's strongest supporters, and he promises to give them free rein .\n\nDara Lind , @DLind\n\nÂ Interestingly, Trump is recycling what had been a Democratic talking point during the George W. Bush administration. Half of what Trump is saying is correct in a literal sense: The US is estimated Â to have spent roughly $5 trillion on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. But the latter half makes an unfair linkage; money is fungible, and the Bush and Obama administrations could have chosen to spend that money here at home (or to have borrowed and spent other money on such projects); they chose not to.\n\nYochi Dreazen , @yochidreazen\n\nWe've made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon. One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores with not even a thought about the millions and millions of American workers that were left behind. The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world.\n\nBut that is the past, and now we are looking only to the future. We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital and in every hall of power. From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this day forward, it's going to be only America first, America first .\n\nâAmerica Firstâ got its start as an isolationist slogan among Americans who resisted entry into World War II for a host of reasons. But it became associated with virulent anti-Semites as war approached and was almost taboo in American politics for two generations. Trump is determined to bring it back.\n\nLibby Nelson , @libbyanelson\n\nEvery decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families. We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs.\n\nProtection will lead to great prosperity and strength. Â I will fight for you with every breath in my body. And I will never ever let you down.\n\nThereâs no doubt that opening the doors to foreign imports has been detrimental to the interests of some Americans who lost jobs in import-competing industries. This negative impact seems to have been concentrated in a handful of swing states and may have given Trump the White House . But only a relatively small number of Americans work in manufacturing, and many of those who do work in manufacturing sectors like airplanes and capital goods where the United States is a net exporter. A serious round of trade protectionism risks simply turning the politics of imports on its head â substantial gains for a geographically concentrated minority of Americans while most people suffer from higher prices and reduced competition.\n\nMatthew Yglesias , @mattyglesias\n\nAmerica will start winning again, winning like never before. We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams. We will build new roads and highways and bridges and airports and tunnels and railways all across our wonderful nation. Â We will get our people off of welfare and back to work,rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor.\n\nAt the moment, Trumpâs main infrastructure plan Â focuses on giving private investors tax credits for building things like new toll highways. Experts tend to think the plan is inadequate Â for addressing many of Americaâs most pressing infrastructure needs, but it seems unlikely that the GOP Congress is going to authorize massive new transportation spending.\n\nBrad Plumer , @bradplumer\n\nWe will follow two simple rules: Buy American and hire American.\n\nWe will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world, but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first. We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example. We will shine for everyone to follow. We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones and reform the world against radical Islamic terrorism , which we will eradicate from the face of the Earth.\n\nHere, Trump is managing to offer both reassuring and deeply alarming words in a single sentence. Trump has questioned the value of NATO and the US alliances with countries like South Korea and Japan, deeply worrying longstanding US allies in Europe and Asia. Trump is trying to at least somewhat allay those fears. But the second half is far more problematic. No senior military or intelligence officials believe that Islamist terror can be âeradicatedâ; the best-case scenario is that measures are taken to reduce the ability of groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS to mount attacks in Europe and the US. Thatâs a tall order, however. And even if those efforts were somehow successful â again, a near impossibility â the US would have no way of preventing them from carrying out attacks in the Middle East, Afghanistan, Pakistan, or other Muslim-majority countries where they enjoy at least a small amount of popular support.\n\nYochi Dreazen , @yochidreazen\n\nTrump here is fulfilling Â a campaign promise Â to refer to major terror threats to America as âradical Islamic terrorismâ rather than in religiously neutral terms, like President Obama (and President George W. Bush before him) preferred. Obama has long argued that religious framing of that nature could backfire and alienate potential Muslim allies the US needs in its war on terror. But Trump and others on the right argued that Obama was failing to accurately define the nature of the threat as they saw it.\n\nAndrew Prokop , @awprokop\n\nAt the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other. When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice. The Bible tells us how good and pleasant it is when God's people live together in unity. We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly , but always pursue solidarity.\n\nThis is a nice sentiment, but thereâs a long tradition of white Americans questioning whether nonwhite Americans can really love their country , and Trump himself has a well-documented Â history of prejudice based on both race and gender .\n\nLibby Nelson , @libbyanelson\n\nOne singular and notable facet of Trumpâs campaign was how much he lied .\n\nLibby Nelson , @libbyanelson\n\nWhen America is united, America is totally unstoppable.\n\nThere should be no fear. We are protected,Â and we will always be protected. We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement. And most importantly, we will be protected by God.\n\nFinally, we must think big and dream even bigger. In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long it is striving. We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action , constantly complaining but never doing anything about it. The time for empty talk is over.\n\nâAll talk, no actionâ is an insult Trump has applied to a lot of politicians, but most recently he used it to refer to Rep. John Lewis Â â an insult that led dozens of Democrats to skip Trumpâs inauguration Â in support of the civil rights hero.\n\nLibby Nelson , @libbyanelson\n\nNow arrives the hour of action. Do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done. No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America. We will not fail. Our country will thrive and prosper again. We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease Â and harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow.\n\nTrump seems to be promising here to battle the ravages of viral health threats. This may be tricky given that his plans for public health, at the moment, amount to job creation. As he said in his health care reform position statement, âThe best social program has always been a job â and taking care of our economy will go a long way towards reducing our dependence on public health programs.â With the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, his party will also kill the Â Prevention and Public Health Fund , which was designed to bolster funding for the prevention and response to outbreaks like Ebola and Zika, among other public health efforts.\n\nJulia Belluz , @juliaoftoronto\n\nA new national pride will stir ourselves, lift our sights,Â and heal our divisions. It's time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget, that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots. We all enjoy the same glorious freedoms. Â And we all salute the same great American flag.\n\nFor the most part, President Trump didnât pick sides about who, exactly, needed to âopen their hearts.â But this tips his hand: The question of whether black and brown Americans really do enjoy the same freedoms as white ones (say, in voting rights Â or the criminal justice system ) is very much an open one. By talking about Americans as individuals who are all alike and all share the same opportunities, Trump is playing into the idea that racism is no longer a problem in American life and anyone who believes otherwise is just playing the victim.\n\nDara Lind , @DLind\n\nAnd whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the wind-swept plains of Nebraska, they look at the same night sky . They fill their heart with the same dreams and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty creator.\n\nThis is meant as a unifying rhetorical flourish, so Trump can be granted a bit of poetic license Â â but light pollution means the skies over the Nebraskan plains and urban centers like Detroit actually look very different .\n\nLibby Nelson , @libbyanelson\n\nSo to all Americans, in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, from ocean to ocean, hear these words: you will never be ignored again.\n\nYour voice, your hopes,Â and your dreams will define our American destiny. And your courage, goodness,Â and love will forever guide us along the way.\n\nTogether, we will make America strong again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again.\n\nAnd yes, together, we will make America great again.\n\nThank you. God bless you.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nby Matthew Yglesias\n\nDonald Trump is not a subtle man, and the first night of the 2016 Republican National Convention reflected that lack of subtlety. Though the theme was \"make America safe again,\" the first two speakers on Monday evening weren't military veterans, law enforcement professionals, crime victims, or politicians. They were C-list celebrities Willie Robertson from Duck Dynasty and Scott Baio from Charles in Charge and Happy Days , and they were there to make the subtext of Trump's campaign into text.\n\nRobertson did start out with a little subtext, saying, \"If you're a cop risking your life to keep us safe at home, Donald Trump will have your back,\" implying that Barack Obama doesn't. But then he made it text. Praising Trump as a guy who tells it like it is, he concluded by saying, \"It may not always be politically correct, but when your father is Phil Robertson you're used to that.\"\n\nThe crowd cheered.\n\nIf you're not a Duck Dynasty fanatic or a connoisseur of obscure political controversies, you may not have picked up the reference. But the issue is that in an infamous 2013 interview , Phil Robertson, Willie Robertson's father, compared homosexuality to terrorism (he also said it's \"illogical\"), that African-Americans were \"singing and happy\" under Jim Crow in the South, and that the Shinto religion is comparable to Nazism. He was roundly criticized for these statements, and rightly so, because they are repugnant things to say.\n\nWillie Robertson doesn't know anything about crime control, counterterrorism, or foreign policy. He was up there to press the case that the United States was beset by a dangerous tide of political correctness that was obscuring the important, honest commentary of folks like Donald Trump and his dad.\n\nUp next came Scott Baio who also started out with a little taste of subtext by explaining that being an American \"doesn't mean getting free stuff.\"\n\nBut then he, too, made it text concluding with the following stirring call: \"Let's make America great again, and lets make America America again.\"\n\nThis is exactly what Trump has been saying but not quite saying this whole campaign. Not that Barack Obama's policies have led to an increase in Americans being killed by terrorists (more died under George W. Bush) or to an increase in the murder rate (it's gone down) but to a loss of American identity. That the old America - the one before black presidents and same-sex marriage and political correctness - was the real America, and the new more tolerant and more open America is inauthentically American.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nShe alluded to President Trump in an emotional speech remembering her father.\n\nby Andrew Prokop\n\nIn an emotional eulogy sharing her memories and love for her father Saturday, Meghan McCain made sure to make her opinions on President Donald Trump very clear.\n\nJohn McCain \"was a great man,\" she said. \"We gather here to mourn the passing of American greatness - the real thing, not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly, nor the opportunistic appropriation of those who lived lives of comfort and privilege while he suffered and served.\"\n\nIt was an obvious reference to President Trump, whose campaign slogan is \"Make America Great Again,\" and who got four draft deferments to avoid serving in the Vietnam War.\n\nLater, Meghan McCain was even clearer: \"The America of John McCain is generous and welcoming and bold. She is resourceful and confident and secure. She meets her responsibilities. She speaks quietly because she is strong. America does not boast because she has no need. The America of John McCain has no need to be made great again because America was always great.\" Applause followed.\n\nThe speech was delivered at the Washington National Cathedral front of three former presidents, many current and former members of Congress, and a plethora of other political elites. The McCains did not invite President Trump to the service.\n\n\"John McCain was not defined by prison, by the navy, by the Senate, by the Republican party or any one of the deeds in his life,\" Meghan McCain said. \"John McCain was defined by love.\"\n\nA rush transcript of her eulogy follows.\n\n\"The world is a fine place and worth the fighting for and I hate, very much, to leave it.\" When Ernest Hemingway's Robert Jordan at the close of For Whom the Bell Tolls lies wounded and waiting for his last fight, these are his final thoughts.\n\nMy father had every reason to think the world was an awful place. My father had every reason to think the world was not worth fighting for. My father had every reason to think the world was worth leaving. He did not think those things.\n\nLike the hero of his favorite book, John McCain took the opposite view. He had to have a lot of luck to have had such a good life. I am here before you saying the words I have never wanted to say, giving this speech I've never wanted to give, feeling the loss I have never wanted to feel. My father is gone.\n\nJohn McCain III was many things. He was a sailor, and aviator, a husband, a warrior, a prisoner. He was a hero, a congressman, a Senator, a nominee for president of the United States.\n\nThese are the titles of a life that has been well lived. They are not the greatest of his titles nor the most important of his roles. He was a great man. We gather here to mourn the passing of American greatness - the real thing, not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly, nor the opportunistic appropriation of those who lived lives of comfort and privilege while he suffered and served.\n\nHe was a great fire who burned bright. In the past few days, my family have heard from so many Americans who stood in the warmth and light of his fire and illuminated what is best. We are grateful to them because they are grateful to him. A few have resented that fire, for the light it cast upon them. For the truth it revealed about their character. But my father never cared what they thought and even that small number still have the opportunity, as long as they draw breath, to live up to the example of John McCain.\n\nMy father was a great man. He was a great warrior. He was a great American. I admired him for these things but I loved him because he was a great father. My father knew what it was like to grow up in the shadow of greatness. He did just as his father had done before him, he was the son of a great admiral who was also the son of a great admiral. When it came time for the third John Sidney McCain, to become a man, he had no choice, in his eyes. He walked in those same paths. He had to become a sailor, to go to war, he to have his shot at becoming a great admiral as they also had done.\n\nThe paths of his father and grandfather led my father directly to the harrowing hell of the Hanoi Hilton. This is where they showed his character, his patriotism, his faith in the worst circumstances. This is where all the biographies, campaign literature and public remembrances say he showed character, patriotism, faith and endurance in the worst of possible circumstances. This is where we learned who John McCain truly was. All of that is true except for the last part. Today, I want to share with you what I found out. It was not in the Hanoi Hilton. It was not in a cockpit of a jet. It was not on the campaign trail. He was in those places but the best of him was somewhere else. The best of John McCain, the greatest of his titles and the most important of his roles was as a father.\n\nImagine the warrior, the knight of the skies, gently caring his little girl to bed. Imagine the dashing aviator who took his his aircraft hurdling off pitching decks in the South China Seas kissing the hurt when I skinned my knee. Imagine the distinguished statesman who counselled presidents and the powerful singing with his little girl in Oak Creek during a rainstorm to \"Singing in the Rain.\" Imagine the Senator taking his daughter out of school because he believed I would learn more about America at the town halls he held. Imagine the elderly veteran of four and government whose wisdom and courage were sought by distinguished men, with his eyes shining as happiness as he gave his blessing for his grown daughter's marriage.\n\nYou all have to imagine that. I don't have to because I lived it all. I know who he was. I know what defined him. I got to see it every single day of my blessed life.\n\nJohn McCain was not defined by prison, why the navy, by the Senate, by the Republican party or any one of the deeds in his life. John McCain was defined by love. Several of you have crossed swords with him or found yourselves on the receiving ends of his famous temper or or were at a cross purposes to him on nearly everything are right at this moment doing your best to stay stone faced. Don't. You know if John McCain were in your shoes here today he would be using some salty word he used in the Navy while my mother jabbed him in embarrassment. He would stop talking but he would keep grinning. She was the only one who could do that.\n\nOn their first date, when he did not know what sort of woman she was, he recited a Robert Service poem to her called \"The Cremation of Sam McGee\" about an Alaskan prospector who welcomes his creation as the only way to get warm in the icy north. \"There are strange things done in the midnight sun by the men who moil for gold / The arctic trails have their secret tales that would make your blood run cold.\" He had learned it in Hanoi. A prisoner in the next cell had rapped it out in code over and over again during the long years of captivity - my father figured if she would sit through that and appreciate the dark humor that had seen him through so many of years of imprisonment, she just might sit with him through a lifetime. And she did.\n\nJohn McCain was defined by love. This love of my father for my mother was the most lasting of them all. Let me tell you what love meant to John McCain and to me. His love was the love of a father who mentors as much as he comforts. He was endlessly present for us and though we did not always understand it, he was always teaching. He did not expect us to be like him. His ambitions for us unmoored from any worldly achievement was to be better than him, armed with his wisdom and informed by his experiences, long before we were old enough to have assembled our own.\n\nAs a girl I did not appreciate what I most fully appreciate now, how he suffered and how he bore it with the stoic silence which was once the mark of an American man. I came to appreciate it when he demanded it of me. I was a small girl thrown from a horse and crying from a busted collarbone. My dad picked me up and took me to the doctor and got me all fixed up. He immediately took me back home and made me get back on that same horse. I was furious at him as a child but how I love him for it now.\n\nMy father knew pain and suffering with an intimacy and immediacy most of us are blessed never to have endured. He was shot down, he was crippled, he was beaten, he was tortured, he was starved, and he was humiliated. That pain never left him. The cruelty of his Communist captors would ensure he would never raise his arms above his head for the rest of his life. Yet he survived. Yet he endured. Yet he triumphed. There was this man who had been through all that with a little girl who simply did not want to get back on her horse. He could have sat me down and told me all of that and made me feel small because my complaint was nothing next to his pain and memories. Instead he made me feel loved. He said in his quiet voice that spoke with authority and meant you had best obey, get back on the horse. I did. Because I was a little girl, I resented it. Now, I look back on that time and see the expression on his face when I climbed back up and rode again, and I see the pride in his eyes as he said \"Nothing is going to break you.\"\n\nFor the rest of my life, whenever I fall down, I would get back up. Whenever I am hurt, I drive on. When I am brought low, I rise. That is not because I am uniquely virtuous or strong or resilient. It is simply because my father, John McCain, was.\n\nWhen my father got sick, when I asked him what he wanted me to do with this eulogy, he said, \"Show them how tough you are.\" That is what love meant to John McCain. Love for my father meant caring for the nation entrusted to him.\n\nMy father, the true son of his father and grandfather, was born into a sense of the heart and character of American greatness and was convinced of the need to defend it with ferocity and faith. John McCain was born in a distant and now vanquished outpost of American power. He understood America as a sacred trust. He understood our republic demands responsibilities even before it defends its rights. He knew navigating the line between good and evil was often difficult but always simple.\n\nHe grasped our purpose and meaning was rooted in a missionary's responsibility stretching back centuries. Just as the first Americans looked upon a new world full of potential for a grand experiment and freedom self-government, so do their descendants have a responsibility to defend the old world from its worst self. The America of John McCain is the America of the revolution: fighters with no stomach for the summer soldier and the sunshine patriot making the world anew with the bells of liberty.\n\nThe America of John McCain is the America of Abraham Lincoln: fulfilling the promise of the Declaration of Independence that all men are created equal and suffering greatly to see it through. The America of John McCain is the America of the boys who rushed the colors in every war across three centuries, knowing that in them is the life of the republic. And particularly those by their daring, as Ronald Reagan said, gave up their chance at being husbands and fathers and grandfathers and gave up their chance to be revered old men. The America of John McCain is, yes, the America of Vietnam, fighting the fight even in the most forlorn cause, even in the most grim circumstances, even in the most distant and hostile corner of the world, standing even defeat for the life and liberty of other people in other lands.\n\nThe America of John McCain is generous and welcoming and bold. She is resourceful and confident and secure. She meets her responsibilities. She speaks quietly because she is strong. America does not boast because she has no need to. The America of John McCain has no need to be made great again because America was always great. [applause]\n\nThat fervent faith. That proven devotion. That abiding love. That is what drove my father from the fiery skies above the Red River Delta to the brink of the presidency itself. Love defined my father. As a young man, he wondered if he would measure up to his distinguished lineage.\n\nI miss him so badly. I want to tell him he did. I take small comfort in this. Somewhere in the great beyond where warriors go, there are two admirals meeting their much loved son. They're telling him he's the greatest among them.\n\nDad, I love you. I always have. All that I am, all that I hope, all that I dream is grounded in what you taught me. You loved me and you showed me what love must be. An ancient Greek historian wrote the image of great men is woven in the stuff of other men's lives. Dad your greatness is woven into my life.\n\nIt is woven into my mother's life. It it is woven into my sister's life and woven into my brothers' lives. It is woven into the life and liberty of the country you sacrificed so much to defend. I know you're not perfect. We live in an era where we knock down old American heroes for all their imperfections, when no leader wants to admit to fault or failure. You were an exception and gave us an ideal to strive for.\n\nLook, I know you can see this gathering here in this cathedral. The nation is here to remember you. Like so many other heroes, you leave us draped in the flag you love. You defended it. You sacrificed it. You have always honored it. It is good to remember that we are Americans. We don't put our heroes on pedestals just to remember them. We raise them up because we want to emulate their virtues. This is how we honor them and this is how we will honor you.\n\nMy father is gone. My father is gone. And my sorrow is immense. I know his life and I know it was great because it was good. And as much as I hate to see him go, I do know how it ended. I know that on the afternoon of August 25, in front of Oak Creek in Cornville Arizona, surrounded by the family he loved so much, an old man shook off the scars of battle one last time and arose a new man, to pilot one last flight - up and up and up, busting clouds left and right, straight on through to the kingdom of Heaven. And he slipped the earthly bonds, put out his hand and touched the face of God.\n\nI love you, Dad.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nDon't judge tariffs on how Trump is using them.\n\nby Abdallah Fayyad\n\nSince President Donald Trump announced a slate of new tariffs on about 90 countries last week, global financial markets have tumbled. False reports about a potential pause in tariffs gave Wall Street a brief moment of false hope on Monday, but the White House has only doubled down, threatening to add more tariffs on China. Economists have also raised the alarm, projecting that Trump's tariffs have increased the odds of a recession .\n\nThis is just the latest update to tariff policies that have already caused a good deal of whiplash since Trump took office in January. He threatened to impose tariffs on Colombia and canceled his plan to do so all in a single day. He rolled out a tariff plan for Canada and Mexico, only to postpone implementing it shortly after some tariffs went into effect. And he's been threatening both allies and adversaries with broad and aggressive tariffs for reasons ranging from cracking down on fentanyl to closing a TikTok deal .\n\nTo be clear, Trump's tariff proposals are bad policy: They are far too broad, haphazard, and have confusing rationales .\n\nBut tariffs are not fundamentally unwise. \"The reality is that tariffs can be, and have been, effective policy tools for promoting industrial development when they're done in a targeted strategic way and when they are matched with other complementary policies,\" said Adam Hersh , a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute.\n\nSo what would good tariff policies actually look like?\n\nA tariff is a tax that's imposed on goods imported from other countries. Oftentimes, the cost is passed on to consumers because companies will raise their prices to offset the tax.\n\nOne of the biggest reasons countries would be interested in levying a tariff is to protect domestic industries from unfair competition. Take the example of Chinese steel. China, which heavily subsidizes its steel industry , produces more than half of the world's steel. Because demand for steel within China has not kept pace with supply, Chinese steel has become much cheaper, potentially selling at a loss in international markets.\n\nThat makes it extremely difficult for steel manufacturers elsewhere to compete, which has prompted governments to respond. Last year, the Biden administration implemented tariffs aimed at curbing imports of Chinese steel in order to protect US manufacturers.\n\nAnother example of unfair competition comes from countries with bad labor standards and very low wages. If, for example, Chinese products are cheaper than American products in part because of extremely low labor costs, the US shouldn't respond by lowering wages to keep local companies competitive. Instead of a race to the bottom, the US can respond by imposing tariffs on certain Chinese products. That allows American companies to pay their workers well without having to sacrifice their competitiveness in the market.\n\nTariffs work best when they are tailored to a specific problem. \"We have to start by making strategic choices about, 'What are the industries that are important to support with public policy?'\" Hersh said. \"That could be for a national security reason, it could be for an economic reason, it could be because of broader social goals like fighting the climate crisis.\"\n\nOther times, a country might be interested in propping up a certain sector to make the supply chain more stable. If the United States is too reliant on other countries to provide certain goods, it can be caught in a crisis when supply chains are disrupted.\n\nThis was \"a lesson learned painfully during the COVID-19 pandemic when everyone was scrambling to source personal protective equipment (PPE), respirators, and critical medicines unavailable domestically at the necessary scale,\" Hersh wrote in an article with Josh Bivens , the chief economist at the Economic Policy Institute. Tariffs, in other words, can help ensure that there isn't a monopoly over crucial imports so that supply chains aren't completely disrupted in the event of war or, as we learned in 2020, a pandemic.\n\nOn his first day back in the White House, Trump announced that he would try to build a whole new agency called the \"External Revenue Service\" to collect taxes on imports. \"His goal is very simple: to abolish the Internal Revenue Service and let all the outsiders pay,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Fox News in February .\n\nBut while tariffs were a main source of revenue for the US government before it introduced federal income taxes in 1913, Trump's supposed plan to replace the IRS with an External Revenue Service is a terrible idea. For starters, tariffs essentially act as a flat tax on spending, which ultimately puts a higher burden on lower-income consumers. It's also impossible for tariffs to raise nearly as much money as income tax.\n\nThis strategy also highlights why Trump's tariff proposals are so poorly planned: He simultaneously wants to raise a significant amount of money from tariffs while also pledging to get rid of tariffs if other countries agree to his terms.\n\nTrump's tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada, for example, were placed in part, he says , to stop fentanyl from flowing into the United States. So what would happen if those countries end up meeting Trump's demands? If Trump's plan is just to raise revenue, then clearly he wouldn't want to come to an agreement with those countries. If his plan is to curb fentanyl, then he clearly doesn't want tariffs to be a permanent source of revenue.\n\n\"The Trump administration has not been targeted or strategic. They have so many different rationales for why they're pursuing tariffs, not all of them have to do with industrial revitalization,\" Hersh said.\n\nThe broad-based approach is also expected to be seriously disruptive, spiking prices on all kinds of products all at once. Even Trump seemed to suggest that would be the case. \"WILL THERE BE SOME PAIN? YES, MAYBE (AND MAYBE NOT!),\" Trump posted on Truth Social , his social media platform. \"BUT WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AND IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID.\"\n\nAnother problem is that Trump seemingly believes that tariffs can stand on their own. But tariffs in and of themselves are not a solution. To be effective at protecting American companies and jobs, tariffs should be coupled with other policies that help spur investments.\n\nTrump has proposed repealing the CHIPS and Science Act , which former President Joe Biden signed into law in 2022. The law invested tens of billions of dollars in America's semiconductor industry by subsidizing companies that want to build new manufacturing facilities in the United States and by funding research and development.\n\nIf Trump is actually interested in using tariffs productively, he should start by first figuring out what his policy objectives actually are. He could also turn to his predecessor for answers. The Biden administration's approach to propping up the semiconductor industry, for example, was to impose some tariffs in addition to the CHIPS Act, using tariffs as just one tool of many to support industry growth. Trump, by contrast, wants to just rely on tariffs without committing to long-term investments. That won't deliver the same goal.\n\nUltimately, it's important to remember that just because Trump's approach to tariffs is bombastic and unpredictable, that shouldn't necessarily be a reflection on tariffs more broadly. At the end of the day, tariffs exist for a reason, and, if implemented well, they can be a beneficial tool to shore up jobs, promote better wages, and advance national interests. \"We can't judge the tool,\" Hersh said, \"by the craftsman that is mishandling it.\"\n\nUpdate, April 8, 6 am ET : This story was originally published on April 2 and has been updated with the latest on Trump's tariffs.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nNice country you got here. Shame if something should happen to it.\n\nby Ezra Klein\n\n\"Make America great again.\" Donald Trump's campaign slogan implies its critique. Isn't America great already?\n\nApparently not. In recent days, though, Trump's distaste for America has come clearer. His frontal assault on the basic legitimacy of the country's presidential election is more than a rationalization - it's a tell, a revealed preference, a window into how little regard Trump has for the country he seeks to lead.\n\nAmerica is great. And one of the reasons it's great is that it has a long history of peaceful, predictable transitions of power. We venerate George Washington for stepping down at a time when his countrymen would have made him king. The Constitution was amended to ensure no leader, no matter how beloved, could hold the White House for more than eight years.\n\nThe tradition is so strong that in 2000, Al Gore conceded the presidency, even though he won more votes than the victor and only lost Florida, if he lost Florida, because of a confusing butterfly ballot. The end of his campaign came through a Supreme Court decision, not a full and fair recount. He could have contested the outcome. But he didn't.\n\nGore loved America. He believed it great, and thus worth protecting. \"Let there be no doubt,\" he said, \"while I strongly disagree with the court's decision, I accept it. I accept the finality of this outcome which will be ratified next Monday in the Electoral College. And tonight, for the sake of our unity as a people and the strength of our democracy, I offer my concession.\"\n\nThis spirit isn't just noble; it's essential for democracies to survive. \"Graceful concessions by losing candidates constitute a sort of glue that holds the polity together, providing a cohesion that is lacking in less-well-established democracies,\" writes Shaun Bowler, a political scientist at UC Riverside, and co-author of Losers' Consent: Elections and Democratic Legitimacy .\n\n\"Graceful concession\" does not appear to be the direction Trump is going. \"Hillary Clinton should have been prosecuted and should be in jail,\" he tweeted on Saturday. \"Instead she is running for president in what looks like a rigged election.\"\n\nRepublicans tried to cover for him. Oh, he just means the media is biased, his supporters said. He doesn't mean the election is literally being rigged .\n\n\"The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary,\" Trump clarified on Sunday, \"but also at many polling places - SAD.\"\n\nSo much for that.\n\nThe election isn't being rigged. And the worst the media is doing to Trump is covering the things he has said, and the things he has done. Trump's problem isn't a conspiracy - it's himself . But that's almost beside the point.\n\nTrump is pouring gasoline atop the foundation of America's democracy and playing with a match. His promise to make America great again is backed by a threat to burn it down. There's much to be said about that, but the simplest point is that it's fundamentally unpatriotic. It shows how little Trump understands, or values, what America has built.\n\nIn his endorsement of anyone-but-Trump, Scott Alexander touches on Trump's disinterest in America's political institutions. \"If your goal is to replace the current systems with better ones, then destroying the current system is 1 percent of the work, and building the better ones is 99 percent of it,\" he writes. \"Throughout history, dozens of movements have doomed entire civilizations by focusing on the 'destroying the current system' step and expecting the 'build a better one' step to happen on its own. That never works .\"\n\nTrump has now gone further than this, though. I have some sympathy for the utopians who dedicate their lives to building the better system, even if they overestimate their chances of success. At this point, though, Trump is simply an arsonist. Sure, he would like to build a better system. But if he's denied the chance, he's just as happy torching this one out of spite. You wouldn't do that if you valued what this country is, if you took seriously how rare its sustained political success has been.\n\n\"Make America great again\" was Trump's campaign slogan, but his closing argument is grimmer: Nice country you got here. Shame if something should happen to it.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

      "text": "Trump holds 'Make America Great Again Victory Rally' on inauguration eve\n\nThe campaign-style rally in Washington mirrors one at Madison Square Garden.\n\nOn the eve of his inauguration, President-elect Donald Trump energized his supporters, laying out the goals of his second administration, thanking the allies that helped him achieve his victory, while giving hints at the legislative agenda he is going to immediately seek to achieve.\n\n\"We won. We won,\" Trump opened Sunday as the Capital One Arena filled with cheers.\n\nTaking a victory lap ahead of being sworn in on Monday, Trump said he will usher in a new era.\n\n\"I'm thrilled to be back with so many friends, supporters, and true American patriots on the eve of taking back our country. That's what we're going to do. Take back our country,\" he said. \"Tomorrow at noon, the curtain closes on four long years of American decline, and we begin a brand-new day of American strength and prosperity, dignity and pride.\"\n\n\"Once and for all, we're going to end the reign of a failed and corrupt political establishment in Washington, a failed administration. We're not going to take it anymore,\" promised Trump.\n\n\"We're going to bring back law and order to our cities. We're going to restore patriotism to our schools, get radical left woke ideologies the hell out of our military and out of our government. And we are going to make America great again.\"\n\nTrump told the audience that they were standing on the verge of four historic years, hyping them up ahead of inauguration festivities on Monday.\n\n\"We put America first and it all starts tomorrow. When I raise my hand on the Bible to be sworn as your - we'll be sworn in tomorrow. We're all going to be sworn in together. That's the way I look at it. It's not, it's you, greatest of all time. So, we will be sworn in tomorrow. I'll be representing you as your 47th president of the United States .\"\n\nThe Sunday rally was one of numerous festivities planned to celebrate Trump's second inauguration, along with fireworks Saturday night at his Virginia golf club and exclusive receptions and dinners.\n\nAt the same time, it's a move to highlight the major role big arena rallies have played in all three of Trump's presidential bids to galvanize his supporters and to carry that campaign spirit into his second-term presidency.\n\nTrump, promising the \"best 100 days,\" quipped about the amount of executive orders he will be signing tomorrow \"to set our country on the proper course.\"\n\n\"Starting tomorrow, I will act with historic speed and strength and fix every single crisis facing our country. We have to do it.\"\n\nTrump went on to talk about how he didn't want to take advice from his advisers who told him to spread out his executive orders.\n\n\"Somebody said yesterday, 'Sir, don't sign so many in one day. Let's do it over a period of weeks.' I said, 'Like hell we're going to do it over weeks. We're going to sign them at the beginning.'\"\n\nPart of the change Trump talked about included his intention to pardon Jan. 6 rioters.\n\n\"Tomorrow, everybody in this very large arena will be very happy with my decision on the J6 hostages. Very happy. I think you'll be very, very happy. I would say about 99.9% in this beautiful arena,\" he said.\n\nHe also focused on immigration, previewing the series of executive orders he is set to sign on Monday. Trump said it would be justice for the victims who have experienced violence at the hands of undocumented immigrants.\n\n\"The border security measures I will outline in my inaugural address tomorrow will be the most aggressive, sweeping effort to restore our borders the world has ever seen,\" he said. \"You know, we had the best, safest border in the history of our country.\"\n\n\"By the time the sun sets tomorrow evening, the invasion of our borders will have come to a halt and all the illegal border trespassers will, in some form or another, be on their way back home,\" he promised.\n\nTrump also took credit for \"saving\" TikTok -- despite the fact that he sought to ban the popular social media app during his first term in office -- reiterating what he said earlier Sunday in a Truth Social post that he was looking at a joint venture between China and the U.S.\n\n\"I said, 'I'll approve, but let the United States of America own 50% of TikTok.' I'm approving on behalf of the United States,\" he said. \"So, they'll have a partner, the United States, and they'll have a lot of bidders. And the United States will do what we call a joint venture. And there's no risk. We're not putting up any money.\"\n\n\"So, whether you like TikTok or not, we're going to make a lot of money,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump also briefly mentioned the three hostages released as part of a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas, praising the work of Steve Witkoff, his special envoy to the Middle East.\n\n\"I got to get myself a negotiator. We have to get a good negotiator. A lot of guys are knowledgeable, but they can't negotiate. They don't have the personality or whatever. And Steve does. And Steve's a great negotiator, very successful guy. But he's our new special envoy to the Middle East for helping reach this great breakthrough. And, really couldn't have been done without Steve.\"\n\nTrump celebrated his Cabinet nominees, offering praise to each of them line by line.\n\nNotably, the only person he brought up on stage was Elon Musk and his son X. He did not bring up Vice President-elect JD Vance, who was expected to speak but didn't.\n\n\"Vance has been extraordinary, and he's got an unbelievable wife. The second lady of the United States, Usha Vance. So, Usha, thank you very much. Beautiful couple of great people.\"\n\nTrump closed his victory rally bringing his supporters with him along for the ride saying, \"Tomorrow, we will all be sworn in together.\"\n\nTrump also promised that he would declassify the assassination files of former President John F. Kenney, his brother Robert Kennedy, and Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\n\n\"As the first step toward restoring transparency and accountability to government, we will also reverse the overclassification of government documents and in the coming days, we are going to make public remaining records relating to the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, his brother Robert Kennedy, as well as Doctor Martin Luther King Jr. and other topics of great public interest.\"\n\nExiting the stage, Trump bopped around to a live performance of the Village People's \"Y.M.C.A.\" and performed his signature dance here and there as the group performed.\n\nThe rally features performances by several other celebrities featured during Trump's 2024 presidential campaign, including country singer-songwriter Lee Greenwood, whose signature song \"God Bless the U.S.A.\" has served as Trump's rally walkout song throughout his campaign.\n\nLongtime Trump supporter and rock musician Kid Rock, country musician Billy Ray Cyrus and Liberty University's Praise Choir also performed.\n\nOn Monday, Trump and his supporters are expected to once again gather at Capital One Arena, which is expected to serve as an overflow venue with the inauguration festivities moved to a much smaller space inside the U.S. Capitol Rotunda due to frigid weather.\n\nTrump on his social media platform touted a \"live viewing\" of his inauguration at the arena on Monday, and promised to join the crowd after he is sworn in.\n\n\"Everyone will be safe, everyone will be happy, and we will, together, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" Trump wrote.\n\nAlso Monday, following the swearing-in ceremony at the U.S. Capitol Rotunda and the inaugural parade moved to the Capital One Arena, three inauguration balls -- the Commander in Chief Ball, the Liberty Inaugural Ball and the Starlight Ball, all attended by Trump -- are set to conclude the inaugural festivities.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Trump nominee to be top general denies wearing MAGA hat\n\nDonald Trump appeared to make that MAGA hat claim a year ago.\n\nRetired Lt. Gen. Dan \"Razin\" Caine, President Donald Trump's nominee to be the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, denied on Tuesday that he has ever worn a \"Make America Great Again\" hat or any other type of political merchandise.\n\nIn at least one retelling of Caine and Trump's first meeting in Iraq in 2018, the president has seemed to indicate Caine was wearing a red MAGA hat, something that would not be allowed under military rules.\n\nThe question was posed by some senators at Caine's confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\n\"Let me start off by asking about some hyperbole that may have been out there in the press,\" Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., said at the start of Tuesday's hearing. \"Gen. Caine, did you wear a MAGA hat in front of the president?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" he responded.\n\nHe provided the same answer when asked by Wicker, \"Did you wear a MAGA hat at any time?\"\n\nAnd when pressed by Wicker, Caine said, \"Sir, for 34 years, I've upheld my oath of office and my commitment to my commission, and I have never worn any political merchandise.\"\n\nWhen Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., the ranking member on the committee, followed up with the same line of questioning, Caine answered, \"As I mentioned to the chairman, for 34 years, I've upheld my oath of office and in the responsibilities of my commission.\n\n\"I think I went back and listened to those tapes, and I think the president was actually talking about somebody else,\" Caine said. \"And I've never worn any political merchandise or said anything to that effect.\"\n\nTrump's story about how he first met Caine has evolved over the years since he first mentioned Caine during remarks at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February 2019, shortly after his trip to Iraq the previous year.\n\nTrump has repeatedly given Caine credit for ending the war against the Islamic State and in his first recounting of their meeting noted how Caine became memorable to him for saying that ISIS could be destroyed in weeks by quickly striking strongly at its last remaining pieces of territory in Syria, something Trump said his advisers in Washington argued could still take years.\n\nIn that first retelling, Trump jokingly focused on how he was struck by the general's call sign \"Razin,\" asking if it was a reference to the raisin fruit.\n\nTrump continued to tell a version of that story over the years, but at last year's CPAC, where he again brought up that first encounter with Caine, the president appeared to state that Caine was wearing a red MAGA hat at the time.\n\nHowever, it was unclear if Trump was referring to Caine or to a sergeant because in the transcript of those remarks, he first mentioned meeting Caine, whom he referred to as general and asked his name.\n\nThen, according to the transcript, Trump appeared to ask a sergeant his name, who in turn told him, according to Trump, \"Yes, sir. I love you, sir. I think you're great, sir. I'll kill for you, sir.\"\n\nThen he puts on a \"Make America Great Again\" hat, as did hundreds of other service members in Trump's retelling.\n\n\"And they're not supposed to do this, but they all put on the 'Make America Great Again' hat, right? Not supposed to do it. I said, you're not supposed to do that. You know that. They said, 'It's OK, sir. We don't care,'\" Trump said.\n\nThe wearing of political merchandise by military service members is not allowed as it is a tenet of an apolitical military.\n\nCaine deflected most questions about the reported use of the Signal app by senior Trump national security officials prior to the U.S. airstrikes against the Houthis in Yemen, noting that the committee's senior leaders have asked for an investigation.\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., questioned Caine about whether he believes any classified information was shared on the Signal chat, specifically regarding the timing of the target and other operational details.\n\n\"Senator, I didn't see the original CONOP,\" Caine responded. However, he added, \"I think we should always preserve the element of surprise, and that is a key and essential thing we owe our warfighters.\"\n\nGillibrand also pressed Caine on what he would have done if he had been on the text chain.\n\n\"I wasn't,\" Caine clarified, calling the messages a \"political, partisan chain.\"\n\nGillibrand pushed back on that characterization, stating, \"It had the head of intelligence, the head of the CIA, our secretary of defense, and the president's top national security advisers.\"\n\nShe continued, \"I can't imagine that if a subordinate of yours shared that type of military information, they wouldn't be fired. Would they not?\"\n\nCaine withheld comment, stating he would wait for the determination of an investigation.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

But it could go up to $20 if we had to make them in the U.S. and embroider them here,\" Lassoff said.\n\nLassoff said a few Chinese manufacturers recently notified his company that they were \"nervous\" about the potential impact of these tariffs and, in the future, may charge more money per order.\n\n\"There might be a limited quantity [of hats] in the future. We're trying to make sure we have enough hats in stock now, so if things change, we're prepared,\" he said.\n\nThe U.S. Trade Representative's office did not respond to ABC News' request for comment.\n\nWhile IncredibleGifts isn't affiliated with the Trump campaign, Lassoff said the company has sold \"a few 100,000 MAGA hats\" since Trump announced his candidacy in June 2015.\n\n\"They're our hottest item,\" he said of the classic red hats with embroidered white lettering.\n\nAmy Lee, manager of The Hat Depot, a New Jersey-based company that also sells the unofficial MAGA hats, said the hats are a big product for her company as well.\n\n\"They're a bestseller,\" she said, adding that her company sells these hats in different colors and typically receives \"20 orders a day\" of the red hats alone.\n\nBut Lee said manufacturers in China haven't yet reached out to The Hat Depot about the possible impact of these tariffs.\n\n\"We buy our hats from China for $3, and we sell them for $14,\" she told ABC News, adding that the Chinese factory \"does everything\" from manufacturing to embroidery.\n\nMoving forward, Lassoff said his company is \"thinking about\" importing goods from Vietnam to avoid the proposed tariffs.\n\n\"I think they would be negative for any business selling goods from China,\" he said. He attributes the difficulty of manufacturing goods in the US to \"taxes and regulations and safety issues\" that he says makes it hard to run a business.\n\nLassoff said he also hopes big online retailers like Amazon and Walmart will lobby against the proposed tariffs on behalf of smaller companies that use their platforms.\n\n\"Our company is way too small to do anything,\" he said.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

For Meta, in particular, this is the first time they've donated to a presidential inauguration, while Apple, Amazon, Google and Microsoft have contributed to past presidential inaugurations.\n\nTrump's inaugural committee has also received major donations from the cryptocurrency industry, including $5 million from Ripple, $2 million from Robinhood, and $1 million from Coinbase, sources told ABC News.

      "text": "Trump has made millions hawking merchandise. Now he could face conflicts of interest\n\nThe president-elect has made millions licensing his name and image for profit.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Donald Trump hawked apparel and keepsakes promoting his presidential bid in what experts ABC spoke with characterized as an unprecedented effort to commoditize his political platform .\n\nNow, after his triumph at the polls, the president-elect is again seeking to cash in on his personal brand with a fresh line of goods, from a pair of $299 \"Trump Landslide\" boots to a $69.99 special inaugural edition of his God Bless the USA Bible.\n\nAs the former president prepares to return to the Oval Office, experts warned that the opaque structure of the companies that produce these items could create fresh conflicts of interest for Trump -- with few public details about who Trump is in business with and how much he profits.\n\n\"We've never seen a president merchandise like this,\" said Jordan Libowitz, a vice president at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a nonprofit watchdog group. \"Tracking partners is very difficult unless they come forward, and there's no way to know for sure.\"\n\nCompared to his $3 billion stake in his social media company and his multimillion-dollar buildings, Trump's licensing deals comprise only a fraction of his portfolio -- but his opaque deals can be ethical \"black boxes\" that escape outside scrutiny according to Libowitz.\n\nWithout knowing who the president-elect is in business with, it's impossible to know if he might use the power of his office to help his bottom line or benefit his business partners or whoever is contributing money to him, Libowitz said.\n\nTrump has entered into the licensing agreements through two companies -- CIC Ventures LLC and CIC Digital LLC -- that are fully owned by The Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust. According to a 2023 financial disclosure, Trump made more than $7 million though CIC Digital LLC, which entered a licensee agreement for the sale of nonfungible tokens or NFTs.\n\nTrump used CIC Ventures LLC to make more than $5 million through bible and book sales, and information is not yet public about how much Trump has made from other deals like his watches and shoes.\n\nThose companies quickly launched new items following Trump's electoral victory. Trump Sneakers unveiled a full line of \"Trump Won\" footwear, including a gold pair of low-top sneakers for $499. Trump Coins unveiled a one-ounce \"Victory Gold Medallion\" -- with the president-elect's face and signature pressed in solid gold -- for $3,645.47, a thousand-dollar upcharge compared to the price of an ounce of gold. And Trump Watches unveiled a \"Victory Collection\" priced between $599 and $1,299.\n\n\"Donald Trump proved his greatest skill was as a salesman, selling mostly junk products, and he hasn't stopped,\" said Robert Weissman, co-president of the progressive watchdog group Public Citizen.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump announced a new plan to sell electric and acoustic guitars with a company called \"Trump Guitars.\"\n\nThe instruments -- which include the phrase \"Make America Great Again\" in pearl inlay -- start at $1,250. A limited version of the guitars signed by Trump is on sale for $11,250. Details about where the guitars are made and how much profit, if any, Trump makes from the sales, were not immediately available, and Trump Guitars did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nItems like Trump sneakers and watches are distinct from the merchandise Trump sells through his campaign website, which offers everything from Make America Great Again hats to Christmas ornaments. The profit from those purchases goes toward Trump's joint fundraising committee, which is subject to rigorous reporting requirements for political contributions.\n\nBut the external companies that Trump licenses to sell his other items aren't subject to oversight. It's an approach that Trump has taken for decades: Making money from his brand by selling everything from steaks to vodka with limited involvement, by outsourcing the design, production, and distribution of the goods under license to separate companies, about which little is often known.\n\nFor someone in power, like the president, that arrangement can create \"areas of potential concern,\" according to Weissman.\n\nDetails about the terms of Trump's agreements with the merchandise companies -- such as JBCZ Group LLC for his coins or TheBestWatchesonEarth LLC for his watches -- are not public, and the LLCs are registered in states that offer few details about the companies' ownership.\n\nSome of Trump's merchandise -- such as his NFTs or watches -- also sell for wildly high prices that create an avenue for individuals, including potentially foreign actors, to channel money to Trump, according to Libowitz. Trump Watches is currently offering a \"Trump Victory Tourbillon\" watch for $100,000.\n\n\"That kind of seems like it is a way to put money directly in his pockets,\" said Libowitz, who believes the watch is likely worth a fraction of its asking price. \"It's an opportunity to give money directly to him and let him know that.\"\n\nTrump Watches, Trump Coins, Trump Sneakers, and God Bless The USA Bible did not respond to ABC News' request for comment, and nor did a spokesperson for Trump's transition team.\n\nWhen Trump entered the White House in 2017, he resigned as the trustee of Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust and passed control to his sons and a business partner to avoid potential conflicts of interest. The setup allowed Trump to still profit from his businesses while relinquishing control of day-to-day operations and decisions.\n\nWhile he regained control of the Trust when he left office in 2021, it's expected that he'll again hand over control when he returns to office in January -- although experts say the arrangement is unlikely to shed additional light on his licensing deals.\n\n\"He's not constrained by any norms or regulations,\" said Weissman. \"He'll disclose what he wants to disclose.\"\n\nAnd with Trump's presidency two months away, watchdog groups worry that weak enforcement of ethics rules could become pervasive throughout the federal government if Trump doesn't set a strong example.\n\n\"This kind of thing trickles down,\" said Scott Amey, general counsel at the nonprofit Project on Government Accountability. \"It would be great to lead from the top.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Trump holds 'Make America Great Again Victory Rally' on inauguration eve\n\nThe campaign-style rally in Washington mirrors one at Madison Square Garden.\n\nOn the eve of his inauguration, President-elect Donald Trump energized his supporters, laying out the goals of his second administration, thanking the allies that helped him achieve his victory, while giving hints at the legislative agenda he is going to immediately seek to achieve.\n\n\"We won. We won,\" Trump opened Sunday as the Capital One Arena filled with cheers.\n\nTaking a victory lap ahead of being sworn in on Monday, Trump said he will usher in a new era.\n\n\"I'm thrilled to be back with so many friends, supporters, and true American patriots on the eve of taking back our country. That's what we're going to do. Take back our country,\" he said. \"Tomorrow at noon, the curtain closes on four long years of American decline, and we begin a brand-new day of American strength and prosperity, dignity and pride.\"\n\n\"Once and for all, we're going to end the reign of a failed and corrupt political establishment in Washington, a failed administration. We're not going to take it anymore,\" promised Trump.\n\n\"We're going to bring back law and order to our cities. We're going to restore patriotism to our schools, get radical left woke ideologies the hell out of our military and out of our government. And we are going to make America great again.\"\n\nTrump told the audience that they were standing on the verge of four historic years, hyping them up ahead of inauguration festivities on Monday.\n\n\"We put America first and it all starts tomorrow. When I raise my hand on the Bible to be sworn as your - we'll be sworn in tomorrow. We're all going to be sworn in together. That's the way I look at it. It's not, it's you, greatest of all time. So, we will be sworn in tomorrow. I'll be representing you as your 47th president of the United States .\"\n\nThe Sunday rally was one of numerous festivities planned to celebrate Trump's second inauguration, along with fireworks Saturday night at his Virginia golf club and exclusive receptions and dinners.\n\nAt the same time, it's a move to highlight the major role big arena rallies have played in all three of Trump's presidential bids to galvanize his supporters and to carry that campaign spirit into his second-term presidency.\n\nTrump, promising the \"best 100 days,\" quipped about the amount of executive orders he will be signing tomorrow \"to set our country on the proper course.\"\n\n\"Starting tomorrow, I will act with historic speed and strength and fix every single crisis facing our country. We have to do it.\"\n\nTrump went on to talk about how he didn't want to take advice from his advisers who told him to spread out his executive orders.\n\n\"Somebody said yesterday, 'Sir, don't sign so many in one day. Let's do it over a period of weeks.' I said, 'Like hell we're going to do it over weeks. We're going to sign them at the beginning.'\"\n\nPart of the change Trump talked about included his intention to pardon Jan. 6 rioters.\n\n\"Tomorrow, everybody in this very large arena will be very happy with my decision on the J6 hostages. Very happy. I think you'll be very, very happy. I would say about 99.9% in this beautiful arena,\" he said.\n\nHe also focused on immigration, previewing the series of executive orders he is set to sign on Monday. Trump said it would be justice for the victims who have experienced violence at the hands of undocumented immigrants.\n\n\"The border security measures I will outline in my inaugural address tomorrow will be the most aggressive, sweeping effort to restore our borders the world has ever seen,\" he said. \"You know, we had the best, safest border in the history of our country.\"\n\n\"By the time the sun sets tomorrow evening, the invasion of our borders will have come to a halt and all the illegal border trespassers will, in some form or another, be on their way back home,\" he promised.\n\nTrump also took credit for \"saving\" TikTok -- despite the fact that he sought to ban the popular social media app during his first term in office -- reiterating what he said earlier Sunday in a Truth Social post that he was looking at a joint venture between China and the U.S.\n\n\"I said, 'I'll approve, but let the United States of America own 50% of TikTok.' I'm approving on behalf of the United States,\" he said. \"So, they'll have a partner, the United States, and they'll have a lot of bidders. And the United States will do what we call a joint venture. And there's no risk. We're not putting up any money.\"\n\n\"So, whether you like TikTok or not, we're going to make a lot of money,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump also briefly mentioned the three hostages released as part of a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas, praising the work of Steve Witkoff, his special envoy to the Middle East.\n\n\"I got to get myself a negotiator. We have to get a good negotiator. A lot of guys are knowledgeable, but they can't negotiate. They don't have the personality or whatever. And Steve does. And Steve's a great negotiator, very successful guy. But he's our new special envoy to the Middle East for helping reach this great breakthrough. And, really couldn't have been done without Steve.\"\n\nTrump celebrated his Cabinet nominees, offering praise to each of them line by line.\n\nNotably, the only person he brought up on stage was Elon Musk and his son X. He did not bring up Vice President-elect JD Vance, who was expected to speak but didn't.\n\n\"Vance has been extraordinary, and he's got an unbelievable wife. The second lady of the United States, Usha Vance. So, Usha, thank you very much. Beautiful couple of great people.\"\n\nTrump closed his victory rally bringing his supporters with him along for the ride saying, \"Tomorrow, we will all be sworn in together.\"\n\nTrump also promised that he would declassify the assassination files of former President John F. Kenney, his brother Robert Kennedy, and Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\n\n\"As the first step toward restoring transparency and accountability to government, we will also reverse the overclassification of government documents and in the coming days, we are going to make public remaining records relating to the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, his brother Robert Kennedy, as well as Doctor Martin Luther King Jr. and other topics of great public interest.\"\n\nExiting the stage, Trump bopped around to a live performance of the Village People's \"Y.M.C.A.\" and performed his signature dance here and there as the group performed.\n\nThe rally features performances by several other celebrities featured during Trump's 2024 presidential campaign, including country singer-songwriter Lee Greenwood, whose signature song \"God Bless the U.S.A.\" has served as Trump's rally walkout song throughout his campaign.\n\nLongtime Trump supporter and rock musician Kid Rock, country musician Billy Ray Cyrus and Liberty University's Praise Choir also performed.\n\nOn Monday, Trump and his supporters are expected to once again gather at Capital One Arena, which is expected to serve as an overflow venue with the inauguration festivities moved to a much smaller space inside the U.S. Capitol Rotunda due to frigid weather.\n\nTrump on his social media platform touted a \"live viewing\" of his inauguration at the arena on Monday, and promised to join the crowd after he is sworn in.\n\n\"Everyone will be safe, everyone will be happy, and we will, together, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" Trump wrote.\n\nAlso Monday, following the swearing-in ceremony at the U.S. Capitol Rotunda and the inaugural parade moved to the Capital One Arena, three inauguration balls -- the Commander in Chief Ball, the Liberty Inaugural Ball and the Starlight Ball, all attended by Trump -- are set to conclude the inaugural festivities.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\"\n\nEarlier this week, Mr. Trump unveiled two new tariffs - a 10% universal duty on all U.S. imports and so-called reciprocal tariffs applied to imports from about 90 nations. He said they would revitalize American manufacturing, create jobs and generate federal revenue.\n\nCountries targeted by Mr. Trump for higher tariffs are due to go into effect on Wednesday. Those include assessments as high as 50% for Lesotho, 49% for Cambodia and 47% for Madagascar.\n\nThe tariff announcement was the latest and perhaps boldest manifestation of Mr. Trump's second term and sent global markets plummeting.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell 6% Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 5.5% and the Nasdaq composite dropped 5.8% - ending the worst week financial markets have had since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMr. Trump said on Truth Social on Saturday that China has been negatively impacted by tariffs \"much harder than the USA, not even close.\"\n\nMr. Trump has warned other countries not to retaliate to the barrage of levies on U.S. imports. Ignoring that advice, China on Friday said it will impose a 34% tariff on imports of all U.S. products starting April 10.\n\nAt his golf course in Jupiter, Florida, the president was spotted in his motorcade reading a tabloid article about China's response to U.S. tariffs.\n\n\"They, and many other nations, have treated us unsustainably badly,\" Mr. Trump said on Truth Social. \"We have been the dumb and helpless \"whipping post,\" but not any longer.\"\n\n© 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

Gen. Dan Caine donned a MAGA hat as proof of loyalty, but Caine told the Senate Armed Services committee on Tuesday that never happened. Mr. Trump may have been speaking about someone else, Caine said.\n\n\"For 34 years, I've upheld my oath of office and the responsibilities of my commission,\" Caine said. \"I went back and listened to those tapes and I think the president was actually talking about somebody else and I've never worn any political merchandise or said anything to that effect.\"\n\nAt the 2024 Conservative Political Action Committee conference, Mr. Trump recounted meeting Caine and a sergeant in Iraq. He then recounted that one of them said, \"'I love you, sir. I think you're great, sir. I'll kill for you, sir.'\" and then they put on Make America Great Again hats. \"You're not allowed to do that, but they did it.\"\n\nCaine told senators during his confirmation hearing that he has never worn a MAGA hat.\n\nMr. Trump tapped Caine in the same social media post in which he fired Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr . who was less than two years into his four-year term as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nCaine is an unconventional pick in part because he retired last year and is a three-star general nominated to a role that requires previous service in a four star position such as one of the joint chiefs or combatant commanders. The president can waive this requirement, according to U.S. code .\n\nMr. Trump, in announcing Caine's nomination said, \"Alongside Secretary Pete Hegseth , General Caine and our military will restore peace through strength, put America First, and rebuild our military.\"\n\nCaine faced questions throughout the hearing about the Signal chat in which Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth shared operational details about strikes in Yemen.\n\n\"We should always preserve, we should always preserve the element of surprise and that should translate across every information domain and format, and never put our war fighters, uh, in any harm's way,\" Caine said.\n\nHe also said he has always put \"proper information in the proper channels\" during his career.\n\nWhen asked further about the chat, he said he wanted to withhold comment since the leaders of the Senate Armed Services Committee have requested an investigation into the signal chat.\n\nBefore his nomination to be chairman, Caine most recently served as the director of special programs for the Pentagon's Special Access Program Central Office. As an F-16 pilot, he logged more than 2,800 hours, including more than 150 combat hours.\n\nEditor's note: This story has been edited to better reflect Mr. Trump's 2024 comments.\n\nEleanor Watson is a CBS News multi-platform reporter and producer covering the Pentagon.\n\n© 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

William Howell, professor of American politics at the University of Chicago, joins CBS News to examine the challenges facing American democracy.\n\nNearly a year after the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, a CBS News poll found the country is still divided over what happened. Nikole Killion has more.\n\nCongressman Adam Schiff, who is on the House January 6 committee, said on \"Face the Nation\" that a focal point of their investigation is what role former President Trump played in the events of that day.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi's spokesperson says the Justice Department has received the criminal contempt referral for former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. Despite handing over thousands of pages of documents, the House voted to hold him in contempt for refusing to testify.

      "text": "Read the full transcript of Trump's inauguration speech\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  January 20, 2025 / 3:34 PM EST / CBS News\n\nWashington - President Trump delivered his second inaugural address Monday, vowing a \"revolution of common sense\" and announcing \"we are at the start of a thrilling new era of national success.\"\n\nIn the 30-minute speech in the Capitol Rotunda, he promised a \"tide of change\" and salvation from what he said was the \"decline\" brought on by the policies of his predecessor, former President Joe Biden.\n\nTo that end, he's expected to sign about 200 executive orders, actions and proclamations following his address.\n\n\"The golden age of America begins right now,\" Mr. Trump said. \"From this day forward, our country will flourish and be respected again all over the world.\"\n\nHere is the full transcript of Mr. Trump's second inaugural address, provided by the Associated Press.\n\nVice President Vance, Speaker Johnson, Senator Thune, Chief Justice Roberts, justices of the United States Supreme Court, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, President Biden, Vice President Harris and my fellow citizens:\n\nThe golden age of America begins right now. From this day forward, our country will flourish and be respected again all over the world. We will be the envy of every nation. And we will not allow ourselves to be taken advantage of any longer.\n\nDuring every single day of the Trump administration, I will, very simply, put America first. Our sovereignty will be reclaimed. Our safety will be restored. The scales of justice will be rebalanced. The vicious, violent and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department and our government will end. And our top priority will be to create a nation that is proud and prosperous and free.\n\nAmerica will soon be greater, stronger, and far more exceptional than ever before. I return to the presidency confident and optimistic that we are at the start of a thrilling new era of national success. A tide of change is sweeping the country. Sunlight is pouring over the entire world, and America has the chance to seize this opportunity like never before.\n\nBut first, we must be honest about the challenges we face. While they are plentiful, they will be annihilated by this great momentum that the world is now witnessing and the United States of America. As we gather today, our government confronts a crisis of trust. For many years, the radical and corrupt establishment has extracted power and wealth from our citizens. While the pillars of our society lay broken and seemingly in complete disrepair, we now have a government that cannot manage even a simple crisis at home while at the same time stumbling into a continuing catalog of catastrophic events abroad.\n\nIt fails to protect our magnificent, law-abiding American citizens but provides sanctuary and protection for dangerous criminals, many from prisons and mental institutions that have illegally entered our country from all over the world. We have a government that has given unlimited funding to the defense of foreign borders but refuses to defend American borders, or more importantly, its own people.\n\nOur country can no longer deliver basic services in times of emergency, as recently shown by the wonderful people of North Carolina, who've been treated so badly. And other states who are still suffering from a hurricane that took place many months ago. Or more recently, Los Angeles, where we are watching fires still tragically burn from weeks ago without even a token of defense. They're raging through the houses and communities, even affecting some of the wealthiest and most powerful individuals in our country, some of whom are sitting here right now. They don't have a home any longer. That's interesting.\n\nBut we can't let this happen. Everyone is unable to do anything about it. That's going to change. We have a public health system that does not deliver in times of disaster, yet more money is spent on it than any country anywhere in the world. And we have an education system that teaches our children to be ashamed of themselves, in many cases to hate our country despite the love that we try so desperately to provide to them. All of this will change starting today and will change very quickly.\n\nOur recent election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal, and all of these many betrayals that have taken place, and to give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy and indeed their freedom. From this moment on, America's decline is over.\n\nOur liberties and our nation's glorious destiny will no longer be denied and we will immediately restore the integrity, competency and loyalty of America's government. Over the past eight years, I have been tested and challenged more than any president in our 250-year history, and I've learned a lot along the way. The journey to reclaim our Republic has not been an easy one, that I can tell you. Those who wish to stop our cause have tried to take my freedom and indeed to take my life. Just a few months ago, in a beautiful Pennsylvania field, an assassin's bullet ripped through my ear. But I felt then, and believe even more so now, that my life was saved for a reason. I was saved by God to make America great again.\n\nThat is why each day under our administration of American patriots, we will be working to meet every crisis with dignity and power and strength. We will move with purpose and speed to bring back hope, prosperity, safety and peace for citizens of every race, religion, color and creed. For American citizens, Jan. 20, 2025, is Liberation Day.\n\nIt is my hope that our recent presidential election will be remembered as the greatest and most consequential election in the history of our country. As our victory showed, the entire nation is rapidly unifying behind our agenda with dramatic increases in support from virtually every element of our society. Young and old, men and women, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, urban, suburban and rural. And, very importantly, we had a powerful win in all seven swing states and the popular vote. We won by millions of people.\n\nTo the Black and Hispanic communities, I want to thank you for the tremendous outpouring of love and trust that you have shown me with your vote. We set records, and I will not forget it. I've heard your voices in the campaign, and I look forward to working with you in the years to come.\n\nToday is Martin Luther King Day and his honor - this will be a great honor - but in his honor, we will strive together to make his dream a reality. We will make his dream come true.\n\nNational unity is now returning to America and confidence and pride is soaring like never before. In everything we do my administration will be inspired by a strong pursuit of excellence and unrelenting success. We will not forget our country. We will not forget our Constitution. And we will not forget our God.\n\nToday, I will sign a series of historic executive orders. With these actions, we will begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense. It's all about common sense. First, I will declare a national emergency at our southern border. All illegal entry will immediately be halted. And we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came. We will reinstate my remain in Mexico policy. I will end the practice of catch and release. And I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country. Under the orders I sign today we will also be designating the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. And by invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to U.S. soil, including our cities and inner cities.\n\nAs commander in chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions. And that is exactly what I am going to do. We will do it at a level that nobody has ever seen before. Next, I will direct all members of my cabinet to marshal the vast powers at their disposal to defeat what was record inflation and rapidly bring down costs and prices. The inflation crisis was caused by massive overspending and escalating energy prices. And that is why today I will also declare a national energy emergency. We will drill, baby, drill.\n\nAmerica will be a manufacturing nation once again, and we have something that no other manufacturing nation will ever have: the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on Earth. And we are going to use it. We will bring prices down, fill our strategic reserves up again, right to the top, and export American energy all over the world. We will be a rich nation again. And it is that liquid gold under our feet that will help to do it.\n\nWith my actions today, we will end the Green New Deal and we will revoke the electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto industry and keeping my sacred pledge to our great American autoworkers. In other words, you'll be able to buy the car of your choice. We will build automobiles in America again at a rate that nobody could have dreamt possible just a few years ago. And thank you to the auto workers of our nation for your inspiring vote of confidence. We did tremendously with their vote.\n\nI will immediately begin the overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers and families. Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens. For this purpose, we are establishing the External Revenue Service to collect all tariffs, duties and revenues. It will be massive amounts of money pouring into our treasury coming from foreign sources.\n\nThe American Dream will soon be back and thriving like never before. To restore confidence and effectiveness to our federal government, my administration will establish the brand new Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nAfter years and years of illegal and unconstitutional federal efforts to restrict free expression, I will also sign an executive order to immediately stop all government censorship and bring back free speech to America. Never again will the immense power of the state be weaponized to persecute political opponents. Something I know something about. We will not allow that to happen. It will not happen again. Under my leadership, we will restore fair, equal and impartial justice under the Constitution and the rule of law. And we are going to bring law and order back to our cities.\n\nThis week, I will also end the government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life. We will forge a society that is colorblind and merit based. As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female. This week I will reinstate any service members who were unjustly expelled from the military for objecting to the Covid vaccine mandate with full back pay. And I will sign an order to stop our warriors from being subjected to radical political theories and social experiments while on duty. It's going to end immediately. Our armed forces will be free to focus on their sole mission-defeating America's enemies. Like in 2017, we will again build the strongest military the world has ever seen.\n\nWe will measure our success not only by the battles we win but also by the wars that we end. And, perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into. My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier. That's what I want to be. A peacemaker and a unifier. I'm pleased to say that, as of yesterday, one day before I assumed office, the hostages in the Middle East are coming back home to their families.\n\nAmerica will reclaim its rightful place as the greatest, most powerful, most respected nation on earth, inspiring the awe and admiration of the entire world. A short time from now, we are going to be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. And we will restore the name of the great President William McKinley to Mount McKinley, where it should be and where it belongs. President McKinley made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent.\n\nHe was a natural businessman and gave Teddy Roosevelt the money for many of the great things he did, including the Panama Canal, which has foolishly been given to the country of Panama after the United States - the United States, I mean, think of this, spent more money than ever spent on a project before and lost 38,000 lives in the building of the Panama Canal. We have been treated very badly from this foolish gift that should have never been made. And Panama's promise to us has been broken. The purpose of our deal and the spirit of our treaty has been totally violated. American ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form, and that includes the United States Navy. And above all, China is operating the Panama Canal. And we didn't give it to China, we gave it to Panama, and we're taking it back.\n\nAbove all, my message to Americans today is that it is time for us to once again act with courage, vigor and the vitality of history's greatest civilization. So as we liberate our nation, we will lead it to new heights of victory and success. We will not be deterred. Together, we will end the chronic disease epidemic and keep our children safe, healthy and disease free. The United States will once again consider itself a growing nation, one that increases our wealth, expands our territory, builds our cities, raises our expectations and carries our flag into new and beautiful horizons. And we will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars, launching American astronauts to plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars.\n\nAnd it's the lifeblood of a great nation. And, right now, our nation is more ambitious than any other. There's no nation like our nation. Americans are explorers, builders, innovators, entrepreneurs and pioneers. The spirit of the frontier is written into our hearts. The call of the next great adventure resounds from within our souls. Our American ancestors turned a small group of colonies on the edge of a vast continent into a mighty republic of the most extraordinary citizens on Earth. No one comes close. Americans pushed thousands of miles through a rugged land of untamed wilderness. They crossed deserts, scaled mountains, braved untold dangers, won the Wild West, ended slavery, rescued millions from tyranny, lifted millions from poverty, harnessed electricity, split the atom, launched mankind into the heavens and put the universe of human knowledge into the palm of the human hand. If we work together, there is nothing we cannot do and no dream we cannot achieve.\n\nMany people thought it was impossible for me to stage such a historic political comeback. But as you see today, here I am. The American people have spoken. I stand before you now as proof that you should never believe that something is impossible to do. In America, the impossible is what we do best. From New York to Los Angeles, from Philadelphia to Phoenix, from Chicago to Miami, from Houston to right here in Washington, D.C., our country was forged and built by the generations of patriots who gave everything they had for our rights and for our freedom. They were farmers and soldiers, cowboys and factory workers, steel workers and coal miners, police officers and pioneers who pushed onward, marched forward and let no obstacle defeat their spirit or their pride. Together they laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, built great highways, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and triumphed over every single challenge that they faced.\n\nAfter all we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the four greatest years in American history. With your help, we will restore an American promise and we will rebuild the nation that we love. And we love it so much. We are one people, one family and one glorious nation under God. So to every parent who dreams for their child and every child to dreams for their future: I am with you, I will fight for you and I will win for you. And we're going to win like never before.\n\nIn recent years, our nation has suffered greatly. But we are going to bring it back and make it great again. Greater than ever before. We will be a nation like no other. Full of compassion, courage and exceptionalism. Our power will stop all wars and bring a new spirit of unity to a world that has been angry, violent, and totally unpredictable.\n\nAmerica will be respected again and admired again, including by people of religion, faith and goodwill. We will be prosperous. We will be proud. We will be strong and we will win like never before. We will not be conquered. We will not be intimidated. We will not be broken. And we will not fail.\n\nFrom this day on, the United States of America will be a free, sovereign and independent nation. We will stand bravely. We will live proudly. We will dream boldly, and nothing will stand in our way. Because we are Americans. The future is ours. And our golden age has just begun.\n\nThank you. God bless America. Thank you all. Thank you.\n\nMelissa Quinn is a politics reporter for CBSNews.com. She has written for outlets including the Washington Examiner, Daily Signal and Alexandria Times.

      "text": "Highlights from Trump's speech to a 2025 joint session of Congress\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  March 5, 2025 / 1:57 PM EST / CBS News\n\nThe president's speech lasted about 1 hour and 40 minutes, including pauses for clapping, applause and other reactions.\n\nThat makes it the longest address to a joint session of Congress since at least 1964, including State of the Union speeches, according to The American Presidency Project by the University of California, Santa Barbara.\n\nThe president ended his speech with an optimistic vision for the future.\n\n\"We are going to create the highest quality of life, build the highest quality of life, build the safest and wealthiest and healthiest and most vital communities anywhere in the world,\" he said. \"We are going to conquer the vast frontiers of science and we are going to lead humanity into space and plant the American flag on the planet Mars and even far beyond.\"\n\nHe continued: \"And through it all, we are going to rediscover the unstoppable power of the American spirit. And we are going to renew [the] unlimited promise of the American dream. Every single day, we will stand up and we will fight, fight, fight for the country our citizens believe in and for the country our people deserve. My fellow Americans, get ready for an incredible future because the golden age of America has only just begun. It will be like nothing that has ever been seen before. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America.\"\n\nMr. Trump honored the family of Corey Comperatore, a firefighter who was killed during the assassination attempt against Mr. Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, last year.\n\n\"Gunfire rang out, and a sick and deranged assassin unloaded eight bullets from his sniper's perch into a crowd of many thousands of people,\" the president said. \"My life was saved by a fraction of an inch, but some were not so lucky.\"\n\nThe president said Comperatore was \"a firefighter, a veteran, a Christian, a husband, a devoted father, and above all, a protector\" who, when the sound of gunshots rang out, \"knew instantly what it was and what to do.\"\n\n\"He threw himself on top of his wife and daughters, and shielded them from the bullets with his own body,\" the president said, while noting that Comperatore's wife and daughters were in the gallery.\n\n\"Corey is looking down on his three beautiful ladies right now and he is cheering you on,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Corey was taken from us much too soon, but his destiny was to leave us all with a shining example of the selflessness devotion of a true American patriot.\"\n\nThe president added that he believes his life was saved in Butler that day \"for a very good reason.\"\n\n\"I was saved by God to make America great again, I believe that,\" he said, reiterating a line he said in his inaugural address.\n\nThe president recalled the 13 American service members killed during a suicide bombing at the airport in Kabul during the 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan, calling the withdrawal under the Biden administration \"disastrous and incompetent.\"\n\n\"Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country,\" he said.\n\nMr. Trump then said he was pleased to announce that his administration has \"just apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity, and he is right now on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice.\"\n\nHe credited the government of Pakistan for helping to arrest \"this monster.\"\n\nMr. Trump, who has suggested using military force or coercion to gain control of Greenland, had a message for the Denmark-owned territory.\n\n\"I also have a message tonight for the incredible people of Greenland,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We strongly support your right to determine your own future, and if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America.\"\n\nMr. Trump said the territory is important to U.S. national security and that his administration is \"working with everybody involved to try and get it.\"\n\n\"And I think we're going to get it, one way or the other,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We're going to get it. We will keep you safe, we will make you rich, and together, we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before. It's a very small population, but very, very large piece of land, and very, very important for military security.\"\n\nRecent polling in Greenland showed 85% of residents did not support becoming part of the United States.\n\nThe president called on Congress to fund a \"Golden Dome missile defense shield,\" similar to Israel's.\n\n\"As commander in chief, my focus is on building the most powerful military of the future,\" Mr. Trump said. \"As a first step, I'm asking Congress to fund a state-of-the-art Golden Dome missile defense shield to protect our homeland. All made in the USA.\"\n\nHe added: \"Other places have it. And the United States should have it too, right?\"\n\nThe president called on Congress \"to pass a bill permanently banning and criminalizing sex changes on children and forever ending the lie that any child is trapped in the wrong body.\"\n\n\"This is a big lie,\" he said. \"And our message to every child in America is that you are perfect, exactly the way God made you.\"\n\nMr. Trump's message is an extension of the anti-transgender policies he vowed to enact during the campaign.\n\nIn February, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to ban transgender girls and women from competing on female sports teams. Schools not in compliance jeopardize any federal funding they receive. The order also affects U.S. visa policies for athletes who travel to the country to compete in the Olympics or other sporting events.\n\nMr. Trump signed another executive order in January to halt federal funding for providers of gender-affirming care for transgender people under the age of 19. The order put restrictions on puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgical procedures. Two federal judges have blocked the order.\n\nIn a touching moment, the president highlighted a 13-year-old boy in the gallery who he said was diagnosed with cancer and \"truly loves our police.\"\n\n\"His name is DJ Daniel, he is 13 years old, and he has always dreamed of becoming a police officer,\" Mr. Trump said.\n\nDaniel waved and held up his hands in the shape of a heart before being hoisted up by his father to see the chamber.\n\nThe president said Daniel suffered from brain cancer and had once been given five months to live. Now, more than six years later, Mr. Trump said Daniel and his father have \"been on a quest to make his dream come true - and DJ has been sworn in as an honorary law enforcement officer.\"\n\nMr. Trump then instructed the director of the U.S. Secret Service to officially make Daniel an agent, to cheers from the chamber.\n\nMr. Trump previously signed an executive order encouraging the U.S. attorney general to push for the death penalty for anyone who murders a police officer. On Tuesday night, he called on Congress to make that executive order a law.\n\n\"I've already signed an executive order requiring a mandatory death penalty for anyone who murders a police officer,\" the president said. \"And tonight, I'm asking Congress to pass that policy into permanent law.\"\n\nThe executive order the president signed doesn't require the death penalty, but it does call on the attorney general, wherever possible consistent with law, to seek the death penalty for every federal capital crime involving the murder of a law enforcement officer.\n\nMr. Trump said law enforcement deserves \"support, protection and respect,\" though he issued sweeping pardons for those convicted or facing charges of assaulting police officers during the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n\"We're also, once again, giving our police officers the support, protection and respect they so dearly deserve. They have to get it. They have such a hard, dangerous job, but we're going to make it less dangerous,\" Mr. Trump said. \"The problem is, the bad guys don't respect the law, but they're starting to respect it, and they soon will respect it.\"\n\nHours after he was sworn into office in January, Mr. Trump granted clemency to about 1,500 defendants who had been convicted of crimes related to the attack on the Capitol, including those who were convicted of violent and serious crimes. More than 140 police officers were injured during the attack.\n\nThe president also directed the Justice Department to end all pending cases connected to the riot.\n\nOne day after announcing new investments in the U.S. by a Taiwanese semiconductor company, the president called on Congress to \"get rid of\" the CHIPS and Science Act , which was enacted under the Biden administration. The law is intended to boost semiconductor chip manufacturing in the U.S., both for economic and national security reasons.\n\nThe bill had significant bipartisan support when it passed in 2022.\n\n\"You should get rid of the CHIP Act, and whatever's left over, Mr. Speaker, you should use it to reduce debt, or any other reason you want to,\" Mr. Trump said.\n\nThe president touted his administration's work to address border security and immigration so far, celebrating what he called \"the most sweeping border and immigration crackdown in American history.\"\n\n\"The media and our friends in the Democrat Party kept saying, 'We needed new legislation, we must have legislation to secure the border,'\" Mr. Trump said. \"But it turns out all we needed was a new president.\"\n\nThe president thanked his border czar Tom Homan and Homeland Security Secretary Krisi Noem for their work so far. And he honored Laken Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student who was murdered by an immigrant in the U.S. illegally whose story became a rallying cry for Republicans on the campaign trail, declaring that \"America will never ever forget\" her. Riley's mother and sister were seated in the gallery.\n\nMr. Trump also shared the story of a 12-year-old girl who he said was killed by immigrants in the U.S. illegally. He addressed her mother in the gallery and highlighted an order he said he signed earlier to rename a wildlife refuge in her daughter's name. The president displayed the order, holding it up to applause from Republicans.\n\nThroughout the speech, a number of Democratic lawmakers have been holding up signs with slogans like \"Musk Steals,\" \"Save Medicaid,\" \"Protect Veterans\" and \"False.\" Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan has a whiteboard that she has used to respond to Mr. Trump in real time:\n\nThe president made his case for his reciprocal tariffs, which will commence April 2. He wants to impose the same tariff on imports from foreign countries as those nations impose on U.S. exports.\n\n\"If you don't make your product in America, however, under the Trump administration, you will pay a tariff, and in some cases, a rather large one,\" he said. \"Other countries have used tariffs against us for decades and now it's our turn to start using them against those other countries. On average, the European Union, China, Brazil, India, Mexico and Canada - have you heard of them? - and countless other nations charge us tremendously higher tariffs than we charge them. It's very unfair.\n\n\"India charges us auto tariffs higher than 100%,\" he continued. \"China's average tariff on our products is twice what we charge them. And South Korea's average tariff is four times higher. Think of that. Four times higher. And we give so much help militarily and in so many other ways to South Korea but that's what happens. This is happening by friend and foe. The system is not fair to the United States and never was.\n\n\"April 2, reciprocal tariffs kick in, and whatever they tariff us, other countries, we will tariff them,\" the president said. \"That's reciprocal. Back and forth. Whatever they tax us, we will tax them.\"\n\nMr. Trump praised American farmers, insisting the tariffs targeting imports from Canada and Mexico will benefit them.\n\n\"I love the farmer, who will now be selling into our whole market, the USA, because nobody is going to be able to compete with you,\" he said. \"Because those goods that come in from other companies and countries, they're really, really in a bad position in so many different ways. They're uninspected. They may be very dirty and disgusting. And they come in and they pour in and they hurt our American farmers.\"\n\nMr. Trump said he wants to make interest payments on car loans tax deductible, \"but only if the car is made in America.\"\n\n\"By the way, we're going to have growth in the auto industry like nobody's ever seen,\" he said. \"Plants are opening up all over the place. Deals are being made.\"\n\nHe said that his policies would allow the U.S. auto industry to \"absolutely boom.\"\n\nMr. Trump said last month that he could impose hefty tariffs on automobile imports, but would have more to say in early April. At the time, he said that the tariffs could be \"in the neighborhood of 25%.\"\n\n\"Already numerous car companies have announced that they will be building massive automobile plants in America,\" he said.\n\nThe president urged Congress, especially Democrats, to vote for tax cuts for \"everybody.\"\n\n\"The next phase of our plan to deliver the greatest economy in history is for this Congress to pass tax cuts for everybody,\" he said, referring to the House GOP's budget plan. \"They're in there, they're waiting for you to vote.\"\n\n\"And I'm sure that the people on my right, I don't mean the Republican right but my right right here, I'm sure you're going to vote for those tax cuts,\" the president told Democratic members. \"Because otherwise, I don't believe that people will ever vote you into office. So I'm doing a big favor by telling you that.\"\n\nMr. Trump said they're \"seeking permanent income tax cuts all across the board,\" which would carry a price tag of at least $4.5 trillion over the next decade.\n\nThe president also called on Congress to eliminate taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security benefits.\n\nMr. Trump claimed he would soon balance the budget, but he has endorsed a plan by Republicans in Congress to extend tax cuts and enact spending reductions that would add trillions to the nation's budget deficit.\n\n\"In the near future, I want to do what has not been done in 24 years, balance the federal budget,\" Mr. Trump said.\n\nLast week, the House narrowly adopted a budget proposal that paves the way for implementing Mr. Trump's border security, defense and energy priorities. Mr. Trump has dubbed it a \"big, beautiful bill.\"\n\nThe House Republican resolution instructs committees to craft legislation that would cut $4.5 trillion in taxes and at least $1.5 trillion in spending over the next 10 years, while raising the debt ceiling by $4 trillion.\n\nThe president said his administration is preparing a \" gold card \" that would allow foreigners to pay $5 million to be placed on a pathway to citizenship, and said it would go on sale \"very, very soon.\" Administration officials have said they won't discriminate based on country of origin, but candidates will be vetted.\n\n\"For $5 million, we will allow the most successful job creating people from all over the world to buy a path to U.S. citizenship,\" he said. \"It's like the green card, but better and more sophisticated. These people will have to pay tax in our country.\"\n\n\"They'll also be taking people out of colleges and paying for them so that we can keep them in our country instead of having them being forced out,\" he added. \"They're going to pay a lot of money and we're going to reduce our debt with that money.\"\n\nMr. Trump, who has overseen a dramatic overhaul of the federal government, touted the changes that have been directed by Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.\n\n\"Perhaps you've heard of it,\" Mr. Trump said as he mentioned the task force. \"Perhaps.\"\n\nMr. Trump said Musk, who is in attendance, has been \"working very hard.\"\n\n\"He didn't need this. He didn't need this,\" he said. \"We appreciate it.\"\n\nThe president then listed various programs, particularly foreign aid-related programs, that his administration has terminated and claimed that the task force has found billions in fraud and waste.\n\n\"By slashing all of the fraud, waste and theft we can find, we will defeat inflation, bring down mortgage rates, lower car payments and grocery prices, protect our seniors and put more money in the pockets of American families,\" Mr. Trump said.\n\nThe president falsely claimed that DOGE has found \"hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud.\" DOGE claims on its website that it has saved $105 billion by slashing contracts and finding fraud. But as of Monday, the data DOGE has made available only itemizes a total of $8.86 billion in canceled federal contracts, and CBS News found this data contains numerous errors and often overstates the amount that was saved.\n\nThe president acknowledged that Americans are hurting from inflation and blamed former President Joe Biden for higher prices.\n\n\"Among my very highest priorities is to rescue our economy and get dramatic and immediate relief to working families,\" he said. \"As you know, we inherited from the last administration an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare. Their policies drove up energy prices, pushed up grocery costs and drove the necessities of life out of reach for millions and millions of Americans.\"\n\nMr. Trump said he's fighting to reverse inflation, the same day his tariffs went into effect that economists predict will contribute to higher prices.\n\n\"As president, I'm fighting every day to reverse this damage and make America affordable again,\" the president said to applause from Republicans.\n\nThe president then blamed Biden for the price of eggs , which has continued to skyrocket under Mr. Trump as bird flu spreads.\n\n\"Joe Biden especially let the price of eggs get out of control,\" he said. \"The egg price is out of control, and we're working hard to get it back down.\"\n\nMr. Trump listed off the litany of executive orders and other changes he's made in the first six weeks since the start of his second term, including renaming the Gulf of Mexico as the \"Gulf of America,\" banning transgender women from playing in girls and women's sports and making English the official language of the U.S.\n\n\"Our country will be woke no longer,\" he said, adding that workers should be hired based on \"skill and competence, not race and gender.\"\n\n\"We've ended the tyranny of so called 'Diversity, Equity and Inclusion' policies all across the entire federal government and indeed the private sector and our military,\" Mr. Trump said.\n\nThe president touted his administration's swift deportations of illegal immigrants, saying Democrats seated in the chamber should celebrate what he is doing.\n\n\"This is my fifth such speech to Congress,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And once again I look at the Democrats in front of me and I realize there is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy or to make them stand or smile or applaud. Nothing I can do.\"\n\nHe continued: \"I could find a cure to the most devastating disease, a disease that would wipe out entire nations, or announce the answers to the greatest economy in history, or the stoppage of crime to the lowest levels ever recorded. And these people sitting right here will not clap, will not stand, and certainly will not cheer for these astronomical achievements. They won't do it, no matter what. Five times I've been up here. It's very sad, and it just shouldn't be this way.\"\n\nDemocratic Rep. Al Green of Texas was escorted from the chamber after he heckled the speech and refused to comply with directions to be quiet and sit.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson warned raucous Democrats to be quiet before Green was escorted out.\n\n\"Members are directed to uphold and maintain decorum in the house and to cease any further disruptions. That's your warning,\" Johnson said. \"Members are engaging in willful and continuing breach of decorum, and the chair is prepared to direct the sergeant at arms to restore order to the joint session.\"\n\nWhen Green declined to take his seat as Johnson asked, Johnson directed the sergeant at arms to restore order and \"remove this gentleman from the chamber.\"\n\nThe president quickly touted his election victory, but was met with jeers and boos from Democrats.\n\n\"The presidential election of Nov. 5 was a mandate like has not been seen in many decades,\" Mr. Trump said, noting that he won all seven battleground states.\n\n\"We won the popular vote by big numbers and won counties in our country,\" Mr. Trump said, as Democratic Rep. Al Green of Texas rose to interrupt him. Republicans quickly stood, coming to the president's support with chants of \"USA.\"\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson rose and instructed the chamber to maintain decorum.\n\nAfter greeting Johnson, Vance, the first lady and Congress, the president began his address.\n\n\"America is back,\" the president said, to applause and chants of \"USA, USA.\"\n\n\"Six weeks ago I stood beneath the dome of this capitol and proclaimed the dawn of the golden age of America. From that moment on it has been nothing but swift and unrelenting action to usher in the greatest and most successful era in the history of our country. We have accomplished more in 43 days than most administrations accomplished in four years or eight years, and we are just getting started,\" he said.\n\nMr. Trump entered the House chamber at 9:13 p.m. as Republican lawmakers applauded. Members of Congress lined the aisle to shake hands with Mr. Trump as he made his way to the dais.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana and Vice President JD Vance are seated behind the lectern where Mr. Trump will deliver the speech. First lady Melania Trump and members of the Cabinet took their seats before Mr. Trump's entrance.\n\nMany Democratic women in Congress are wearing bright pink in a display of defiance against the president.\n\nRep. Teresa Leger Fernández of New Mexico, who leads the Democratic Women's Caucus, told Time magazine that the color signifies \"our protest of Trump's policies which are negatively impacting women and families.\"\n\n\"Pink is a color of power and protest,\" she told the magazine. \"It's time to rev up the opposition and come at Trump loud and clear.\"\n\nThe 96-member group spoke about their opposition to the president outside the U.S. Capitol prior to the address on Tuesday, where Leger Fernández asserted, \"Women cannot afford Trump.\"\n\nRead more here .\n\nThe following Supreme Court justices are attending the president's speech, and entered the chamber before Mr. Trump was introduced:\n\nJustices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Sonya Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson are not in attendance.\n\nMr. Trump's motorcade arrived at the Capitol at 8:40 p.m., accompanied by first lady Melania Trump.\n\nBillionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk was in the president's motorcade, although not in the same vehicle.\n\nMoments earlier, Vice President JD Vance arrived at the Capitol, shaking the hands of the senators who not long ago were his colleagues.\n\nDoug Collins, the secretary of veterans affairs, is tonight's \"designated survivor,\" the member of the president's Cabinet who is not attending the speech. The practice, which originated in the Cold War, calls for an official in the presidential line of succession to stay away from the proceedings in case a catastrophe strikes the House chamber.\n\nRead more here .\n\nThe Constitution says the president shall, \"from time to time,\" give a report on the \"State of the Union\" to Congress. This speech typically takes place in January or February, and gives presidents the opportunity to tout their accomplishments over the past year and lay out their agenda for the months ahead.\n\nSince Mr. Trump has only been in office for six weeks and a day, his address is not technically considered a State of the Union. Rather, it's known as a joint address to Congress. But it will look and sound much like a State of the Union, with the president addressing lawmakers from the House chamber, and Speaker Mike Johnson and Vice President JD Vance seated behind him.\n\nMr. Trump is expected to address what he views as his accomplishments so far before discussing the economy, immigration and foreign policy.\n\nKathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital, based in Washington, D.C.\n\nCopyright ©2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "text": "Trumpâs 2025 joint session address, fact checked and annotated\n\nBy Zachary B. Wolf and Curt Merrill , CNN\n\nPublished March 5, 2025\n\nAmericans are reeling from the early weeks of Trump 2.0, and President Donald Trump got a prime-time chance to explain the fast and furious start to his return to power in an address to a joint session of Congress.\n\nHe made the case for the trade wars heâs started with Canada and Mexico, defended his effort with Elon Musk to downsize and remake American government, and faced loud opposition and heckling from Democrats, one of whom was removed from the chamber.\n\nRead Trumpâs speech, annotated with context and fact checks, below.\n\nSee more details about topics of Trumpâs address\n\nThank you very much. Thank you very much. It's a great honor. Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker Johnson, Vice President Vance , the first lady of the United States, the members of the United States Congress. Thank you very much. And to my fellow citizens, America is back.\n\nJohnson and Vance behind Trump are a visual representation of the hold Republicans have on Washington. Their House and Senate majorities are small, but they control every branch of power at the moment.\n\nSix weeks ago, I stood beneath the dome of this Capitol and proclaimed the dawn of the golden age of America. From that moment on, it has been nothing but swift and unrelenting action to usher in the greatest and most successful era in the history of our country.\n\nIt sure has been swift and unrelenting. Agree with it or not, but Trump, working with Elon Musk at his Department of Government Efficiency, has set the pace to completely remake the US government and redefine the place of the US in the world order.\n\nWe have accomplished more in 43 days than most administrations accomplished in four years, or eight years , and we are just getting started.\n\nTrump will always say heâs accomplished more than anyone. Heâs got a way to go to catch presidents like FDR.\n\nI return to this chamber tonight to report that America's momentum is back. Our spirit is back, our pride is back, our confidence is back, and the American dream is surging bigger and better than ever before.\n\nThe American dream is unstoppable, and our country is on the verge of a comeback the likes of which the world has never witnessed and perhaps will never witness again. There's never been anything like it.\n\nThe presidential election of November 5 was a mandate like has not been seen in many decades . We won all seven swing states, giving us an electoral college victory of 312 votes.\n\nHe can claim a mandate, having won the popular vote , but itâs by no means historic. Rep. Al Green rose to yell at Trump when he said this and was shouted down by Republicans yelling âUSA.â\n\nWe won the popular vote by big numbers and won counties in our country 2,700 to 525 â on a map that reads almost completely red for Republican.\n\nNow, for the first time in modern history, more Americans believe that our country is headed in the right direction than the wrong direction. In fact, it's an astonishing record: 27-point swing â the most ever.\n\nActually, a CNN Poll conducted by SSRS and released this week found that just 39% of Americans said the country was moving in the right direction, compared with 45% who said it was moving in the wrong direction. Thatâs a drop from when Trump started his first term.\n\nLikewise, small-business optimism saw its single largest one-month gain ever recorded , a 41-point jump.\n\nFrom CNNâs Daniel Dale: This claim needs context. If Trump was referring to the commonly cited NFIB Small Business Optimism Index, his claim about a 41-point increase appears to be a reference to one component â the percentage of small-business owners expecting the economy to improve. That measure did soar a net 41 percentage points from pre-election October to post-election November. Trump didnât mention that the total index then declined in January , to a level that is still high but lower than it was under Trump in September 2020 and October 2020 â less than five years ago.\n\n[interruption, Texas Rep. Al Green removed from chamber]\n\nJohnson warns Rep. Green by name before the sergeant at arms walks down the aisle and escorts him out of the chamber. Green, by the way, was among the first lawmakers calling for Trumpâs impeachment during his first term, and has again called for Trump to be impeached even though he just recently took office.\n\nOver the past six weeks, I have signed nearly 100 executive orders and taken more than 400 executive actions â a record â to restore common sense, safety, optimism and wealth all across our wonderful land. The people elected me to do the job, and I'm doing it.\n\nIt is an epic pace of executive orders. Some are more consequential than others. Track them all, sorted by general topic, here .\n\nIn fact, it has been stated by many that the first month of our presidency â it's our presidency â is the most successful in the history of our nation. And what makes it even more impressive is that, do you know No. 2 is? George Washington . How about that? I don't know about that list. But we'll take it.\n\nItâs not clear who stated Trumpâs presidency has been second only to George Washingtonâs in terms of success. Trump has now said it. Heâs compared himself to George Washington before.\n\nWithin hours of taking the oath of office, I declared a national emergency on our southern border, and I deployed the US military and border patrol to repel the invasion of our country. And what a job they've done. As a result, illegal border crossings last month were by far the lowest ever recorded. Ever.\n\nFrom CNNâs Daniel Dale and Devan Cole: Trump claimed that, since taking office again, he has already achieved the lowest number of illegal border crossings âever recorded.â Thatâs false. He could have accurately said the number of Border Patrol apprehensions at the southern border in February â the first full month of his second term â is the lowest in many decades, at least if itâs true that the number was 8,326, as he claimed on social media before the speech. But official federal statistics show there were fewer Border Patrol encounters with migrants at the southwest border in some of the months of the early 1960s.\n\nThey heard my words and they chose not to come â much easier that way. In comparison, under Joe Biden, the worst president in American history, there were hundreds of thousands of illegal crossings a month, and virtually all of them, including murderers, drug dealers, gang members and people from mental institutions and insane asylums , were released into our country. Who would want to do that?\n\nFrom CNNâs Daniel Dale and Haley Britzky: There is no evidence for the presidentâs claim, which Trumpâs own presidential campaign was unable to corroborate. (The campaign was unable to provide any evidence even for his narrower claim that South American countries in particular were emptying their mental health facilities to somehow dump patients upon the US.)\n\nThis is my fifth such speech to Congress, and once again, I looked at the Democrats in front of me, and I realize there is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy or to make them stand or smile or applaud â nothing I can do.\n\nAs Trump says Democrats will never stand and applaud him, cameras show some of them holding small signs that say things like, âMusk stealsâ and âfalse.â\n\nI could find a cure to the most devastating disease, a disease that would wipe out entire nations, or announce the answers to the greatest economy in history, or the stoppage of crime to the lowest levels ever recorded. And these people sitting right here will not clap, will not stand and certainly will not cheer for these astronomical achievements. They won't do it no matter what. Five times I've been up here. It's very sad, and it just shouldn't be this way.\n\nSo Democrats sitting before me, for just this one night, why not join us in celebrating so many incredible wins for America. For the good of our nation, let's work together, and let's truly make America great again.\n\nA hallmark of Trumpâs politics is that whenever he is in charge, he says things are great. And whenever Democrats are in charge, he says they are horrible.\n\nEvery day, my administration is fighting to deliver the change America needs, to bring a future that America deserves, and we're doing it. This is a time for big dreams and bold action. Upon taking office, I imposed an immediate freeze on all federal hiring, a freeze on all new federal regulations and a freeze on all foreign aid.\n\nI terminated the ridiculous green new scam. I withdrew from the unfair Paris Climate Accord, which was costing us trillions of dollars that other countries were not paying. I withdrew from the corrupt World Health Organization. And I also withdrew from the anti-American UN Human Rights Council.\n\nFrom CNNâs Ella Nilsen: This claim is inaccurate. Former President Joe Biden pledged to pay $11.4 billion per year toward international climate financing upon taking office. However, the US contribution to a global finance goal ended up being far lower because Congress appropriated less money than Bidenâs goal. Bidenâs State Department announced it had allocated $5.8 billion to international climate finance by 2022. US climate finance contributions have never reached trillions of dollars.\n\nTrump did indeed remove the US from international agreements and groups. He also removed the US from the Paris Climate Agreement during his first term. But Biden put the US back in.\n\nWe ended all of Biden's environmental restrictions that were making our country far less safe and totally unaffordable. And, importantly, we ended the last administration's insane electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto workers and companies from economic destruction.\n\nFrom CNNâs Bryan Mena: There has never been a federal mandate prohibiting Americans from buying gasoline-powered cars, which he claimed existed in his inaugural address. During the Biden administration, legislation was passed to support electric vehicles. Trump signed an executive order shortly after taking office in January seeking to reverse that. However, eliminating those policies may require congressional action.\n\nTo unshackle our economy, I have directed that for every one new regulation, 10 old regulations must be eliminated, just like I did in my very successful first term. And in that first term, we set records on ending unnecessary rules and regulations like no other president had done before.\n\nWe ordered all federal workers to return to the office. They will either show up for work in person or be removed from their job.\n\nMore than half of federal workers were already working from the office full- or part-time when Trump took office, but his requirement has been cited as an effort to cull the federal workforce.\n\nAnd we've ended weaponized government, where, as an example, a sitting president is allowed to viciously prosecute his political opponent, like me . How did that work out? Not too good. Not too good.\n\nFrom CNNâs Daniel Dale and Devan Cole: Thatâs false. Trumpâs two federal indictments were brought by a special counsel, Jack Smith. Smith was appointed in November 2022 by Attorney General Merrick Garland, a Biden appointee â but that is not proof that Biden was involved in the prosecution effort, much less that Biden personally ordered the indictments.\n\nAnd I've stopped all government censorship and brought back free speech in America. It's back.\n\nAnd two days ago, I signed an order making English the official language of the United States of America.\n\nThe English as a national language and Gulf of America efforts can be tied together with a very clear racial overtone.\n\nI renamed the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America. And likewise, I renamed, for a great president, William McKinley, Mount McKinley, again. Beautiful Alaska, we love Alaska.\n\nWe've ended the tyranny of so-called diversity, equity and inclusion policies all across the entire federal government, and indeed the private sector, and our military . And our country will be woke no longer.\n\nThe anti-diversity initiatives are visible in the chamber. Trump removed Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Charles Q. Brown, a Black man; and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth fired Admiral Lisa Franchetti, the chief of the Navy and first woman to serve on the Joint Chiefs, whom Hegseth had described as a âDEI hire.â\n\nWe believe that whether you are a doctor, an accountant, a lawyer or an air traffic controller, you should be hired and promoted based on skill and competence, not race or gender. Very important.\n\nYou should be hired based on merit, and the Supreme Court, in a brave and very powerful decision has allowed us to do so. Thank you. Thank you very much.\n\nWe have removed the poison of critical race theory from our public schools and I signed an order making it the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders: male and female.\n\nI also signed an executive order to ban men from playing in women's sports.\n\nThree years ago, Payton McNabb was an all-star high school athlete â one of the best â preparing for a future in college sports. But when her girlsâ volleyball match was invaded by a male, he smashed the ball so hard in Payton's face, causing traumatic brain injury, partially paralyzing her right side and ending her athletic career. It was a shot like she's never seen before. She's never seen anything like it. Payton is here tonight in the gallery, and Peyton, from now on, schools will kick the men off the girlsâ team or they will lose all federal funding.\n\nAnd if you really want to see numbers, just take a look at what happened in the women's boxing, weightlifting, track and field, swimming or cycling, where a male recently finished a long distance race five hours and 14 minutes ahead of a woman for a new record by five hours. Broke the record by five hours. It's demeaning for women, and it's very bad for our country. We're not going to put up with it any longer.\n\nWhat I've just described is only a small fraction of the common sense revolution that is now, because of us, sweeping the entire world. Common sense has become a common theme , and we will never go back. Never, ever going to let that happen.\n\nAs CNNâs John King said , ââCommon senseâ is a Trump term for what others would call culture war: English as the official language, Gulf of America, Mount McKinley, transgender issues and so on. It plays well with his base, but those issues don't lower prices at the grocery store, so when he got there ... it is all blame Biden.â\n\nAmong my very highest priorities is to rescue our economy and get dramatic and immediate relief to working families . As you know, we inherited from the last administration an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare.\n\nTrump may soon face criticism over inflation. The price of eggs has risen, in part because of avian flu , and he has imposed tariffs on goods from Mexico, Canada and China.\n\nTheir policies drove up energy prices, pushed up grocery costs and drove the necessities of life out of reach for millions and millions of Americans â they've never had anything like it.\n\nWe suffered the worst inflation in 48 years, but perhaps even in the history of our country â they're not sure. As president, I'm fighting every day to reverse this damage and make America affordable again.\n\nJoe Biden, especially, let the price of eggs get out of control . The egg price is out of control, and we're working hard to get it back down.\n\nFrom CNNâs Piper Hudspeth Blackburn, Elisabeth Buchwald and Vanessa Yurkevich: The avian flu has caused egg prices to rise because the United States Department of Agriculture requires the culling of entire flocks to stop the spread if the virus is detected. Itâs a practice that occurred during the Biden administration, but also one that is continuing under Trump as the virus continues to infect flocks nationwide. When Biden took office, the average price of a carton of a dozen grade A eggs across US cities was $1.47, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data . By the time Biden left office in January, a carton of eggs cost $4.95 on average, a 2.7% increase from a year prior. Due to short supply, egg prices are projected to increase by 41.1% this year, according to the USDAâs food outlook as of February 25.\n\nSecretary, do a good job on that. You inherited a total mess from the previous administration. Do a good job.\n\nA major focus of our fight to defeat inflation is rapidly reducing the cost of energy. The previous administration cut the number of new oil and gas leases by 95 percent, slowed pipeline construction to a halt and closed more than 100 power plants. We are opening up many of those power plants right now.\n\nAnd frankly, we have never seen anything like it. That's why, on my first day in office, I declared a national energy emergency.\n\nAs you've heard me say many times, we have more liquid gold under our feet than any nation on earth, by far. And now I've fully authorized the most talented team ever assembled to go and get it. It's called drill , baby, drill.\n\nAll oil is not the same. CNNâs Ella Nilsen and Amy OâKruk explained in a recent story how much of what the US can get at home might not help lower gas prices.\n\nMy administration is also working on a gigantic natural gas pipeline in Alaska â among the largest in the world â where Japan, South Korea and other nations want to be our partner with investments of trillions of dollars each. There's never been anything like that one. It will be truly spectacular. It's all set to go, the permitting is gotten. And later this week, I will also take historic action to dramatically expand production of critical minerals and rare earths here in the USA.\n\nTo further combat inflation, we will not only be reducing the cost of energy, but will be ending the flagrant waste of taxpayer dollars.\n\nAnd to that end, I have created the brand-new Department of Government Efficiency, DOGE. Perhaps you've heard of it. Perhaps.\n\nWhich is headed by Elon Musk , who is in the gallery tonight. Thank you Elon, you're working very hard. He didn't need this. He didn't need this. Thank you very much. We appreciate it.\n\nIs DOGE headed by Elon Musk? There have been conflicting reports.\n\nEverybody here, even this side, appreciates it, I believe. They just don't want to admit that.\n\nDemocrats have been criticized by Trump and others for not embracing Muskâs cuts, which Republicans describe as eliminating waste and fraud. But Democrats have also not been included in the process.\n\nJust listen to some of the appalling waste we have already identified. $22 billion from HHS to provide free housing and cars for illegal aliens. $45 million for diversity, equity and inclusion scholarships in Burma. $40 million to improve the social and economic inclusion of sedentary migrants. Nobody knows what that is. $8 million to promote LGBTQI+ in the African nation of Lesotho, which nobody has ever heard of. $60 million for indigenous peoples and Afro Colombian empowerment in Central America â $60 million. $8 million for making mice transgender. This is real. $32 million for a left-wing propaganda operation in Moldova. $10 million for male circumcision in Mozambique. $20 million for the Arab Sesame Street in the Middle East. It's a program â $20 million for a program. $1.9 billion to recently created decarbonization of homes committee headed up â and we know she's involved â just at the last moment, the money was passed over â by a woman named Stacey Abrams. Have you ever heard of her?\n\nFrom CNNâs Deidre McPhillips: Trumpâs claim is false. Between the 2021 and 2022 fiscal years, the National Institutes of Health awarded a total of $477,121 to three projects that involved administering feminizing hormone therapy to monkeys to understand how it may affect their immune system and make them more susceptible to HIV. Itâs not clear where the $8 million figure came from or why Trump referenced studies in mice instead of monkeys.\n\nA $3.5 million consulting contract for lavish fish monitoring. $1.5 million for voter confidence in Liberia, $14 million for social cohesion in Mali. $59 million for illegal alien hotel rooms in New York City.\n\nIt has been difficult to confirm the details on many of these programs. DOGE has a very simple website that is not much more than a version of the groupâs feed on Muskâs X social media platform.\n\n$250 thousand to increase vegan local climate action innovation in Zambia. $42 million for social and behavior change in Uganda. $14 million for improving public procurement in Serbia. $47 million for improving learning outcomes in Asia . Asia is doing very well with learning. Know what we're doing, we should use it ourselves.\n\nMost of what Trump mentioned is spending on foreign aid, although it is a fraction â around 1% â of the annual budget .\n\nAnd $101 million for DEI contracts at the Department of Education â the most ever paid, nothing even like it.\n\nUnder the Trump administration, all of these scams â and there are far worse, but I didn't think it was appropriate to talk about them, they're so bad. Many more have been found out and exposed and swiftly terminated by a group of very intelligent, mostly young people, headed up by Elon We appreciate it. We found hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud.\n\nFrom CNNâs Casey Tolan: This figure, which is uncorroborated, needs context. Musk and other Trump allies have claimed DOGEâs work is aimed at targeting waste, fraud and abuse. But DOGE has not released evidence that the contracts it has canceled were fraudulent. And at least some of the cuts have been reversed amid criticism.\n\nAnd we've taken back the money and reduced our debt to fight inflation and other things. Taking back a lot of that money, we got it just in time. This is just the beginning. The Government Accountability Office, a federal government office, has estimated annual fraud of over $500 million in our nation , and we are working very hard to stop it. We're going to.\n\nHereâs that GAO report . Itâs a little more complicated than Trump suggests. There are distinct concepts â âimproper paymentsâ and âfraudâ â that need to be considered.\n\nWe're also identifying shocking levels of incompetence and probable fraud in the Social Security program for our seniors, and that our seniors and people that we love rely on. Believe it or not, government databases list 4.7 million Social Security numbers from people aged 100 to 109 years old .\n\nFrom CNNâs Tami Luhby and Daniel Dale: The vast majority of these people do not have dates of death listed in Social Securityâs database. But that doesnât mean they are actually receiving monthly benefits. Public data from the Social Security Administration shows that about 89,000 people age 99 or over were receiving Social Security benefits in December 2024, not even close to the millions Trump invoked.\n\nIt lists 3.6 million people from ages 110 to 119. I don't know any of them. I know some people that are rather elderly, but not quite that elderly. 3.47 million people from ages 120 to 129. 3.9 million people from ages 130 to 139. 3.5 million people from ages 140 to 149, and money is being paid to many of them, and we're searching right now. In fact, Pam, good luck, good luck. You're going to find it .\n\nTrump has promised not to cut Social Security, but clearly feels that eliminating fraud is not a cut. He will need to prove there is fraud, and heâs asking Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute some people.\n\nBut a lot of money is paid out to people, because it just keeps getting paid and paid, and nobody does, and it really hurts Social Security. It hurts our country. 1.3 million people from ages 150 to 159, and over 130,000 people, according to the Social Security databases, are age over 160 years old. We have a healthier country than I thought, Bobby.\n\nIncluding, to finish, 1,039 people between the ages of 220 and 229; one person between the age of 240 and 249; and one person is listed at 360 years of age, more than 100 years â more than 100 years older than our country. But we're gonna find out where that money's going, and it's not going to be pretty.\n\nBy slashing all of the fraud, waste and theft we can find, we will defeat inflation, bring down mortgage rates, lower car payments and grocery prices, protect our seniors and put more money in the pockets of American families.\n\nAnd today, interest rates took a beautiful drop â big, beautiful drop â it's about time. And in the near future, I want to do what has not been done in 24 years: balance the federal budget â we're going to balance it.\n\nWith that goal in mind, we have developed in great detail what we are calling the gold card, which goes on sale very, very soon. For $5 million we will allow the most successful, job-creating people from all over the world to buy a path to US citizenship . It's like the green card, but better and more sophisticated.\n\nTrump made his political name promising mass deportations of undocumented immigrants from mostly poor countries. Here heâs inviting the wealthy to buy access to the US.\n\nAnd these people will have to pay tax in our country. They won't have to pay tax from where they came. The money that they've made, you wouldn't want to do that, but they have to pay tax, create jobs.\n\nThey'll also be taking people out of colleges and paying for them so that we can keep them in our country, instead of having them being forced out â No. 1 at the top school, as an example â being forced out and not being allowed to stay and create tremendous numbers of jobs and great success for a company out there.\n\nSo while we take out the criminals, killers, traffickers and child predators who are allowed to enter our country under the open border policy of these people, the Democrats, the Biden administration â the open border, insane policies that you've allowed to destroy our country â we will now bring in brilliant, hard working job creating people. They're going to pay a lot of money, and we're going to reduce our debt with that money.\n\nAmericans have given us a mandate for bold and profound change. For nearly 100 years, the federal bureaucracy has grown until it has crushed our freedoms , ballooned our deficits and held back America's potential in every possible way.\n\nThe last president who oversaw a budget surplus was Bill Clinton, who did it with major prodding from Republicans in Congress. Recent annual budget deficits have been more than $1 trillion, although those included emergency spending and Trumpâs first-term tax cuts.\n\nThe nation founded by pioneers and risk-takers now drowns under millions and millions of pages of regulations and debt. Approvals that should take 10 days to get, instead take 10 years, 15 years and even 20 years before you're rejected. Meanwhile, we have hundreds of thousands of federal workers who have not been showing up to work. My administration will reclaim power from this unaccountable bureaucracy, and we will restore true democracy to America again.\n\nAnd any federal bureaucrat who resists this change will be removed from office immediately. Because we are draining the swamp â it's very simple â and the days of rule by unelected bureaucrats are over.\n\nAnd the next phase of our plan to deliver the greatest economy in history is for this Congress to pass tax cuts for everybody. They're in there. They're waiting for you to vote. And I'm sure that the people on my right â I don't mean the Republican right, but my right right here â I'm sure you're going to vote for those tax cuts, because otherwise I don't believe the people will ever vote you into office, so I'm doing you a big favor by telling you that. But I know this group is going to be voting for the tax cut.\n\nIt's a very, very big part of our plan. We had tremendous success in our first term with it â a very big part of our plan. We're seeking permanent income tax cuts all across the board, and to get urgently needed relief to Americans hit especially hard by inflation, I'm calling for no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on Social Security benefits for our great seniors.\n\nOne reason Trump needs to cut government spending is to pay for these additional tax cuts he has promised.\n\nAnd I also want to make interest payments on car loans tax-deductible, but only if the car is made in America.\n\nBy the way, we're gonna have growth in the auto industry like nobody's ever seen â plants are opening up all over the place, deals are being made â never seen. That's a combination of the election win and tariffs. It's a beautiful word, isn't it? That, along with our other policies, will allow our auto industry to absolutely boom. It's going to boom. Spoke to the majors today, all three, the top people, and they're so excited. In fact, already, numerous car companies have announced that they will be building massive automobile plants in America, with Honda just announcing a new plant in Indiana, one of the largest anywhere in the world.\n\nHonda announced it will produce the hybrid Civic in Indiana in order to avoid Trumpâs tariffs on Mexico, according to Reuters.\n\nAnd this has taken place since our great victory on November 5, a date which will hopefully go down as one of the most important in the history of our country.\n\nIn addition, as part of our tax cuts, we want to cut taxes on domestic production and all manufacturing, and just as we did before, we will provide 100% expensing. It will be retroactive to January 20, 2025, and it was one of the main reasons why our tax cuts were so successful in our first term, giving us the most successful economy in the history of our country. First term, we had a great first term.\n\nIf you don't make your product in America, however, under the Trump administration, you will pay a tariff, and in some cases a rather large one. Other countries have used tariffs against us for decades, and now it's our turn to start using them against those other countries.\n\nDuring the campaign Trump frequently talked about his love for the word tariff. Here he seems to be explaining it to Americans.\n\nOn average, the European Union, China, Brazil, India, Mexico and Canada â have you heard of them? â and countless other nations charge us tremendously higher tariffs than we charge them. It's very unfair. India charges us auto tariffs higher than 100%. China's average tariff on our products is twice what we charge them, and South Korea's average tariff is four times higher. Think of that, four times higher â and we give so much help militarily and so many other ways to South Korea. But that's what happens. This is happening by friend and foe. The system is not fair to the United States. It never was.\n\nThis is the meatiest portion of the speech so far. Trump is trying to build support for his tariffs, which alarm many Americans and also alarmed the stock market , which dropped this week.\n\nAnd so on April 2 â I wanted to make it April 1, but I didn't want to be accused of April Fool's Day. That's what â that's not â just one day was cost us a lot of money. But we're going to do it in April. I'm a very superstitious person. April 2, reciprocal tariffs kick in , and whatever they tariff us, other countries, we will tariff them. That's reciprocal, back and forth. Whatever they tax us, we will tax them.\n\nOr, perhaps this means countries have a little less than a month to negotiate.\n\nIf they do nonmonetary tariffs to keep us out of their market, then we will do nonmonetary barriers to keep them out of our market. There's a lot of that, too, they don't even allow us in their market. We will take in trillions and trillions of dollars and create jobs like we have never seen before . I did it with China, and I did it with others, and the Biden administration couldn't do anything about it because it was so much money. They couldn't do anything about it. We have been ripped off for decades by nearly every country on Earth, and we will not let that happen any longer.\n\nFrom CNNâs Daniel Dale and Tami Luhby: Trumpâs claim needs context. Tariffs are paid by US importers, not foreign exporters, and itâs easy to find specific examples of companies that passed along the cost of the tariffs to US consumers.\n\nMuch has been said over the last three months about Mexico and Canada, but we have very large deficits with both of them. But even more importantly, they've allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens and many very young, beautiful people â destroying families. Nobody's ever seen anything like it. They are, in effect, receiving subsidies of hundreds of billions of dollars. We pay subsidies to Canada and to Mexico of hundreds of billions of dollars, and the United States will not be doing that any longer. We're not going to do it any longer.\n\nThanks to our America-first policies we're putting into place, we have had $1.7 trillion of new investment in America in just the past few weeks. The combination of the election and our economic policies that people of SoftBank, one of the most brilliant anywhere in the world, announced a $200 billion investment. OpenAI and Oracle â Larry Ellison â announced $500 billion investment, which they wouldn't have done if Kamala had won. Apple announced $500 billion investment â Tim Cook called me, he said, âI cannot spend it fast enough.â It's going to be much higher than that, I believe. They'll be building their plants here instead of in China. And just yesterday, Taiwan Semiconductor, the biggest in the world, most powerful in the world, has a tremendous amount â 97% â of the market, announced a $165 billion investment to build the most powerful chips on Earth, right here in the USA.\n\nAnd we're not giving them any money. Your CHIPS Act is a horrible, horrible thing . We give hundreds of billions of dollars, and it doesn't mean a thing. They take our money and they don't spend it. All that meant to them. We're giving them no money. All that was important to them was they didn't want to pay the tariffs, so they came and they're building, and many other companies are coming. We don't have to give them money. We just want to protect our businesses and our people. And they will come because they wonât have to pay tariffs if they build in America. So it's very amazing. You should get rid of the CHIPS Act, and whatever's left over, Mr. Speaker, you should use it to reduce debt, or any other reason you want to.\n\nThe CHIP S A ct, which was intended to build up a domestic semiconductor industry, was passed with bipartisan majorities in the House and Senate, and signed by Biden into law. Trumpâs administration has been working to cancel some contracts.\n\nOur new trade policy will also be great for the American farmer â I love the farmer â who will now be selling into our home market, the USA, because nobody is going to be able to compete with you, because those goods that come in from other countries and companies. They're really, really in a bad position in so many different ways. They're uninspected. They may be very dirty and disgusting, and they come in and they pour in and they hurt our American farmers.\n\nFarmers â or people in rural America â are part of Trumpâs base of support. But they will be among those hurt most by his trade war.\n\nThe tariffs will go on agricultural product coming into America and our farmers, starting on April 2 â it may be a little bit of an adjustment period . We had that before, when I made the deal with China, $50 billion of purchases, and I said, just bear with me. And they did. They did. Probably have to bear with me again, and this will be even better. That was great. The problem with it was that Biden didn't enforce it. He didn't enforce it. $50 billion of purchases, and we were doing great, but Biden did not enforce it, and it hurt our farmers, but our farmers are going to have a field day right now. So to our farmers, have a lot of fun. I love you, too. I love you, too.\n\nAnd I have also imposed a 25% tariff on foreign aluminum, copper, lumber and steel, because, if we don't have, as an example, steel and lots of other things, we don't have a military, and frankly, we just won't have a country very long.\n\nHere today is a proud American steel worker, fantastic person from Decatur, Alabama. Jeff Denard has been working at the same steel plant for 27 years in a job that has allowed him to serve as the captain of his local volunteer fire department, raise seven children with his beautiful wife, Nicole, and over the years, provide a loving home for more than 40 foster children. So great job.\n\nHats off to Jeff.\n\nThank you, Jeff. Stories like Jeff's remind us that tariffs are not just about protecting American jobs, they're about protecting the soul of our country. Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again. And it's happening, and it will happen rather quickly. There'll be a little disturbance. We're okay with that. It won't be much.\n\nEconomists arenât so sure the disturbance will be so âlittleâ from these tariffs. They could impact everyday Americans to the tune of $1,200 per year, and thatâs before the reciprocal tariffs Trump promised in this speech.\n\nAnd look, and look where Biden took us. Very low, the lowest we've ever been. Jeff, I want to thank you very much. And I also want to recognize another person who has devoted herself to foster care, community. She works so hard on it. You're a very loving person, our magnificent first lady of the United States.\n\nMelania's work has yielded incredible results, helping prepare our nation's future leaders as they enter the workforce. Our first lady is joined by two impressive young women, very impressive: Haley Ferguson, who benefited from the first lady's Fostering the Future initiative, and is poised to complete her education and become a teacher; and Elliston Berry, who became a victim of an illicit deepfake image produced by a peer . With Elliston's help, the Senate just passed the Take It Down Act, and â this is so important. Thank you very much, John Thune. Thank you, John. Thank you all very much.\n\nDeepfakes are a major problem .\n\nAnd thank you to John Thune and the Senate, great job, to criminalize the publication of such images online â just a terrible, terrible thing â and once it passes the House, I look forward to signing that bill into law. Thank you. And I'm going to use that bill for myself, too, if you don't mind. Because nobody gets treated worse than I do online. Nobody.\n\nThat's great. Thank you very much to the Senate. Thank you.\n\nBut if we truly care about protecting Americans' children, no step is more crucial than securing America's borders. Over the past four years, 21 million people poured into the United States. Many of them were murderers, human traffickers, gang members and other criminals from the streets of dangerous cities all throughout the world. Because of Joe Biden's insane and very dangerous open border policies, they are now strongly embedded in our country, but we are getting them out and getting them out fast.\n\nItâs surprising that Trump waited this long into the speech to talk about his deportation efforts. His administration has struggled to work as fast as Trump would like. In fact, the pace of deportation flight s so far has not been much different from that under Biden in 2024, according to data analyzed by CNNâs Priscilla Alvarez and RenÃ©e Rigdon.\n\nAnd I want to thank Tom Homan, and Kristi, I want to thank you. And Paul of Border Patrol, I want to thank you. What a job they've all done. Everybody, Border Patrol, ICE. Well, law enforcement in general is incredible. We have to take care of our law enforcement.\n\nLast year, a brilliant 22-year-old nursing student named Laken Riley â the best in her class, admired by everybody â went out for a jog on the campus of the University of Georgia. That morning, Laken was viciously attacked, assaulted, beaten, brutalized and horrifically murdered. Laken was stolen from us by a savage illegal alien gang member who was arrested while trespassing across Biden's open southern border, and then sent loose into the United States under the heartless policies of that failed administration â it was indeed a failed administration. He had then been arrested and released in a Democrat run sanctuary city â a disaster â before ending the life of this beautiful young angel. With us this evening, are Laken's beloved mother, Allyson, and her sister, Lauren.\n\nRileyâs death was a major campaign issue for Republicans, and passing the Laken Riley Act , which requires certain migrants to be detained when accused of a crime, was a major victory for Trump and Republicans.\n\nLast year, I told Laken's grieving parents that we would ensure their daughter would not have died in vain. That's why the very first bill I signed into law as your 47th president mandates the detention of all dangerous criminal aliens who threaten public safety. It's very strong, powerful act.\n\nIt's called the Laken Riley Act, so Allyson and Lauren, America will never ever forget our beautiful Laken Hope Riley.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nSince taking office, my administration has launched the most sweeping border and immigration crackdown in American history, and we quickly achieved the lowest numbers of illegal border crossers ever recorded. Thank you.\n\nThe media and our friends in the Democrat party kept saying, \"We needed new legislation. We must have legislation to secure the border,\" but it turned out that all we really needed was a new president.\n\nJoe Biden didn't just open our borders. He flew illegal aliens over them to overwhelm our schools, hospitals and communities throughout the country. Entire towns like Aurora, Colorado, and Springfield, Ohio, buckled under the weight of the migrant occupation and corruption, like nobody's ever seen before â beautiful towns destroyed. Now, just as I promised in my inaugural address, we are achieving the great liberation of America.\n\nSpringfield is the place where Trump and Vance falsely insisted Haitian refugees were eating dogs and cats. It wasnât true .\n\nBut there still is much work to be done. Here tonight is a woman I have gotten to know, Alexis Nungaray, from Houston. Wonderful woman. Last year, Alexis' 12-year-old daughter, her precious Jocelyn, walked to a nearby convenience store. She was kidnapped, tied up, assaulted for two hours under a bridge and horrifically murdered. Arrested and charged with this heinous crime are two illegal alien monsters from Venezuela, released into America by the last administration through their ridiculous open border. The death of this beautiful 12-year-old girl and the agony of her mother and family touched our entire nation greatly .\n\nJocelyn Nungarayâs death was also a campaign issue.\n\nAlexis, I promised that we would always remember your daughter, your magnificent daughter. Earlier tonight, I signed an order keeping my word to you. One thing I have learned about Jocelyn is that she loved animals so much â she loved nature. Across Galveston Bay from where Jocelyn lived in Houston, you will find a magnificent National Wildlife Refuge; a pristine, peaceful, 34,000-acre sanctuary for all of God's creatures, on the edge of the Gulf of America. Alexis, moments ago, I formally renamed that refuge in loving memory of your beautiful daughter, Jocelyn. So Mr. Vice President, if you would, may I have the order? Thank you very much.\n\nTrumpâs signing of an order during the joint address to Congress seems like it must be a first.\n\nAll three savages charged with Jocelyn and Laken's murders were members of the Venezuelan prison gang â the toughest gang, they say, in the world â known as Tren de Aragua. Two weeks ago, I officially designated this gang, along with MS-13 and the bloodthirsty Mexican drug cartels, as foreign terrorist organizations.\n\nThey are now officially in the same category as ISIS, and that's not good for them.\n\nCountless thousands of these terrorists were welcomed into the US by the Biden administration, but now every last one will be rounded up and forcibly removed from our country, or if they're too dangerous, put in jails standing trial in this country because we don't want them to come back ever.\n\nWith us this evening is a warrior on the front lines of that battle, Border Patrol agent Roberto Ortiz â great guy. In January, Roberto and another agent were patrolling by the Rio Grande, near an area known as Cartel Island â doesn't sound too nice to me â when heavily armed gunmen started shooting at them. Roberto saw that his partner was totally exposed, in great danger and he leapt into action, returning fire and and providing crucial seconds for his fellow agent to seek safety â and just barely. I have some of the prints of that event, and it was not good. Agent Ortiz, we salute you for your great courage and for your line of fire that you took and for the bravery that you showed, we honor you and we will always honor you. Thank you, Roberto, very much.\n\nThere was a major standing ovation for Ortiz, who teared up.\n\nAnd I actually got to know him on my many calls to the border. He's a great, great gentleman. The territory to the immediate south of our border is now dominated entirely by criminal cartels that murder, rape, torture and exercise total control. They have total control over a whole nation, posing a great threat to our national security. The cartels are waging war on America, and it's time for America to wage war on the cartels, which we are doing.\n\nFive nights ago, Mexican authorities, because of our tariff policies being imposed on them â think of this â handed over to us, 29 of the biggest cartel leaders in their country . That has never happened before. They want to make us happy. First time ever.\n\nLearn more about Rafael Caro Quintero and the 28 other alleged criminals extradited to the US from Mexico.\n\nBut we need Mexico and Canada to do much more than they've done. They have to stop the fentanyl and drugs pouring into the USA. They're going to stop it.\n\nTrump has overstated the amount of fentanyl coming into the US from Canada. It is a fraction of what authorities seize.\n\nI have sent Congress a detailed funding request laying out exactly how we will eliminate these threats to protect our homeland and complete the largest deportation operation in American history â larger even than current record-holder President Dwight D . Eisenhower, a moderate man, but someone who believed very strongly in borders.\n\nTrump is referring to Eisenhowerâs horribly named â Operation Wetback .â\n\nAmericans expect Congress to send me this funding without delay so I can sign it into law. So Mr. Speaker, John Thune, both of you, I hope you're going to be able to do that. Mr. Speaker, thank you. Mr. Leader, thank you. Thank you very much. And let's get it to me, I'll sign it so fast, you won't even believe it.\n\nRepublicans will have to coalesce around a government spending bill to deliver this funding to Trump. They have an extremely small majority in the House and Democrats are unlikely to help them.\n\nAnd as we reclaim our sovereignty, we must also bring back law and order to our cities and towns. In recent years our justice system has been turned upside down by radical left lunatics. Many jurisdictions virtually seized, enforcing the law against dangerous repeat offenders while weaponizing law enforcement against political opponents like me. My administration has acted swiftly and decisively to restore fair, equal and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law, starting at the FBI and the DOJ. Pam, good luck. Kash, wherever you may be, good luck. Good luck.\n\nTrumpâs first-term FBI Director, Chris Wray, had years left on his 10-year term, but Trump made clear he wanted Patel for the job. Patel, a conspiracy theorist , was among Trumpâs more controversial nominees.\n\nThey've already started very strong. They're going to do a fantastic job. You're going to be very proud of them. We're also, once again, giving our police officers the support, protection and respect they so dearly deserve â they have to get it. They have such a hard, dangerous job, but we're going to make it less dangerous. The problem is, the bad guys don't respect the law, but they're starting to respect it, and they soon will respect it.\n\nRepublicans generally support police, but Trumpâs pardon of January 6 rioters who attacked Capitol Police complicates that.\n\nThis also includes our great fire departments throughout the country. Our firemen and women are unbelievable people, and we'll never forget them. And besides that, they voted for me in record numbers so I have no choice.\n\nOne year ago this month, 31-year-old New York police officer Jonathan Diller â unbelievably wonderful person and a great officer â was gunned down at a traffic stop on Long Island. I went to this funeral. The vicious criminal charged with his murder had 21 prior arrests, and they were rough arrests, he was a real bad one. The thug in the seat next to him had 14 prior arrests and went by the name of Killer. He was Killer. He killed other people, they say, a lot of them. I attended officer Diller's service, and when I met his wife and 1-year-old son, Ryan, it was very inspirational, actually. His widow's name is Stephanie, and she is here tonight. Stephanie, thank you very much, Stephanie.\n\nStephanie, we're going to make sure that Ryan knows his dad was a true hero, New York's finest, and we're going to get these cold-blooded killers and repeat offenders off our streets, and we're going to do it fast. Got to stop it. They get out with 28 arrests. They push people into subway trains. They hit people over the head â back of the head â with baseball bats. We got to get them out of here. I've already signed an executive order requiring a mandatory death penalty for anyone who murders a police officer, and tonight I'm asking Congress to pass that policy into permanent law.\n\nI'm also asking for a new crime bill, getting tough on repeat offenders while enhancing protections for America's police officers so they can do their jobs without fear of their lives being totally destroyed. They don't want to be killed. We're not going to let them be killed.\n\nJoining us at the gallery tonight is a young man who truly loves our police. His name is DJ Daniel, he is 13 years old, and he has always dreamed of becoming a police officer.\n\nDJ was dressed in a police uniform and was held up to applause.\n\nBut in 2018, DJ was diagnosed with brain cancer. The doctors gave him five months, at most, to live. That was more than six years ago. Since that time, DJ and his dad have been on a quest to make his dream come true, and DJ has been sworn in as an honorary law enforcement officer â actually a number of times. Peace. The police love him. The police departments love them. And tonight, DJ, we're going to do you the biggest honor of them all. I am asking our new Secret Service director, Sean Curran, to officially make you an agent of the United States Secret Service .\n\nIt was a touching moment when DJ hugged the Secret Service director. Trump has elevated the showmanship associated with guests at these presidential addresses.\n\nThank you, DJ. DJ's doctors believe his cancer likely came from a chemical he was exposed to when he was younger. Since 1975, rates of child cancer have increased by more than 40 percent. Reversing this trend is one of the top priorities for our new Presidential Commission to Make America Healthy Again, chaired by our new secretary of health and human services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nWith the name Kennedy, you would have thought everybody over here would have been cheering. How quickly they forget.\n\nOur goal is to get toxins out of our environment, poisons out of our food supply, and keep our children healthy and strong. As an example, not long ago â and you can't even believe these numbers â one in 10,000 children had autism, one in 10,000, and now it's one in 36. There's something wrong â one in 36, think of that â so we're going to find out what it is. And there's nobody better than Bobby and all of the people that are working with you, you have the best, to figure out what is going on. Okay, Bobby? Good luck. It's a very important job. Thank you.\n\nKennedy, of course, has questioned whether vaccines are to blame, although that theory has been debunked. As HHS secretary, he has said he wants to see more evidence about vaccines. Trumpâs portrayal of the rise in autism rates is also distorted .\n\nMy administration is also working to protect our children from toxic ideologies in our schools. A few years ago, January Littlejohn and her husband discovered that their daughter's school had secretly socially transitioned their 13-year-old little girl. Teachers and administrators conspired to deceive January and her husband, while encouraging her daughter to use a new name and pronouns â they/them pronouns actually â all without telling January, who is here tonight and is now a courageous advocate against this form of child abuse. January, thank you.\n\nStories like this are why, shortly after taking office, I signed an executive order banning public schools from indoctrinating our children with transgender ideology.\n\nI also signed an order to cut off all taxpayer funding to any institution that engages in the sexual mutilation of our youth.\n\nAnd now I want Congress to pass a bill permanently banning and criminalizing sex changes on children, and forever ending the lie that any child is trapped in the wrong body. This is a big lie.\n\nThis type of law would likely not be able to pass through the Senate as long as the filibuster exists.\n\nAnd our message to every child in America is that you are perfect, exactly the way God made you.\n\nBecause we're getting wokeness out of our schools and out of our military , and it's already out, and it's out of our society. We don't want it. Wokeness is troubled. Wokeness is bad. It's gone. It's gone. And we feel so much better for it, don't we? Don't we feel better?\n\nAs Trump says âwokenessâ is gone from the military, the camera panned to top generals, all of whom are now White men.\n\nOur service members won't be activists and ideologues. They will be fighters and warriors. They will fight for our country. And Pete, congratulations. Secretary of defense, congratulations. And he's not big into the woke movement, I can tell you. I know him well.\n\nI am pleased to report that in January, the US Army had its single best recruiting month in 15 years, and that all armed services are having among the best recruiting results ever in the history of our services. What a difference.\n\nAnd you know it was just a few months ago, where the results were exactly the opposite; we couldn't recruit anywhere. We couldn't recruit. Now having the best results just about that we've ever had, what a tremendous turnaround. It's really a beautiful thing to see people love our country again. It's very simple. They love our country and they love being in our military again. So it's a great thing. And thank you very much. Great job.\n\nWe're joined tonight by a young man, Jason Hartley, who knows the weight of that call of duty. Jason's father, grandfather and great-grandfather all wore the uniform. Jason tragically lost his dad, who was also a Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputy, when he was just a boy, and now he wants to carry on the family legacy of service. Jason is a senior in high school, a six-letter varsity athlete â a really good athlete, they say; a brilliant student with a 4.46 â that's good â GPA. And his greatest dream is to attend the US Military Academy at West Point.\n\nAnd Jason, that's a very big deal getting in, that's a hard one to get into, but I'm pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted. You will soon be joining the Corps of Cadets.\n\nThat makes Jasonâs year, clearly. Getting into West Point is hard!\n\nJason, you're going to be on the long gray line, Jason. As commander in chief, my focus is on building the most powerful military of the future. As a first step, I'm asking Congress to fund a state-of-the-art golden dome missile defense shield to protect our homeland, all made in the USA.\n\nRonald Reagan wanted to do it long ago, but the technology just wasn't there, not even close. But now we have the technology. It's incredible, actually. And other places, they have it. Israel has it, other places have it. And the United States should have it, too, right? Tim, right? They should have it too. So I want to thank you â but it's a very, very important â this is a very dangerous world, we should have it. We want to be protected and we're going to protect our citizens like never before.\n\nOne major difference between Israel and the US is size. CNN recently reported on the effort to make a missile defense shield over Guam, which is facing obstacles.\n\nTo boost our defense-industrial base, we are also going to resurrect the American shipbuilding industry, including commercial shipbuilding and military shipbuilding.\n\nAnd for that purpose, I am announcing tonight that we will create a new office of shipbuilding in the White House and offer special tax incentives to bring this industry home to America, where it belongs. We used to make so many ships. We don't make them anymore very much, but we're going to make them very fast, very soon. It will have a huge impact. To further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we've already started doing it.\n\nJust today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals.\n\nBlackRock is the company buying ports on either side of the canal from Hong Kong.\n\nThe Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others, but others could use it. But it was built at tremendous cost of American blood and treasure â 38,000 workers died building the Panama canal . They died of malaria. They died of snake bites and mosquitoes â not a nice place to work. They paid them very highly to go there, knowing there was a 25 percent chance that they would die. The most expensive project also that was ever built in our country's history, if you bring it up to modern-day costs.\n\nFrom CNNâs Daniel Dale: Trump repeated his false claim that 38,000 Americans died during the building of the Panama Canal. That figure is not even close to true, experts on the canalâs construction say.\n\nIt was given away by the Carter administration for $1. But that agreement has been violated very severely. We didn't give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and we're taking it back.\n\nAnd we have Marco Rubio in charge. Good luck, Marco. Now we know who to blame if anything goes wrong. Now, Marco has been amazing and he's going to do a great job. Think of it â he got 100 votes. You know, he was approved with actually 99, but the 100th was this gentleman â and I feel very certain â so let's assume he got 100 votes. And I'm either very, very happy about that or I'm very concerned about it. But he's already proven â I mean, he's a great gentleman. He's respected by everybody. And we appreciate your voting for Marco. He's going to do a fantastic job.\n\nThank you. Thank you. He's doing a great job. Great job.\n\nAnd I also have a message tonight for the incredible people of Greenland. We strongly support your right to determine your own future. And if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America. We need Greenland for national security and even international security. And we're working with everybody involved to try and get it.\n\nIf Trump obtains Greenland and the Panama Canal, it will signal a new period of American expansion , something that has not occurred since the early 20th century.\n\nBut we need it really for international world security. And I think we're going to get it. One way or the other, we're going to get it. We will keep you safe. We will make you rich, and together we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before. It's a very small population, but a very, very large piece of land and very, very important for military security.\n\nWhat Greenlanders want is an open question. CNNâs Donie OâSullivan traveled there in February to talk to residents about joining the US.\n\nAmerica is once again standing strong against the forces of radical Islamic terrorism. Three and a half years ago, ISIS terrorists killed 13 American service members and countless others in the Abbey Gate bombing during the disastrous and incompetent withdrawal from Afghanistan . Not that they were withdrawing, it was the way they withdrew. Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country.\n\nFamilies of some of the service members killed at Abbey Gate have been major backers of Trump. They appeared with him at the Republican National Convention.\n\nTonight, I am pleased to announce that we have just apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity, and he is right now on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice.\n\nAnd I want to thank especially the government of Pakistan for helping arrest this monster. This was a very momentous day for those 13 families, who I actually got to know very well, most of them, whose children were murdered and the many people that were so badly â over 42 people so badly injured on that fateful day in Afghanistan. What a horrible day. Such incompetence was shown that when Putin saw what happened, I guess he said, \"Wow, maybe this is my chance.\"\" That's how bad it was. Should have never happened. Grossly incompetent people.\n\nI spoke to many of the parents and loved ones and they're all in our hearts tonight. Just spoke to them on the phone. We had a big call. Every one of them called and everybody was on the line and they did nothing but cry with happiness. They were very happy. As happy as you can be under those circumstances. Their child, brother, sister, son, daughter, was killed for no reason whatsoever.\n\nIn the Middle East we're bringing back our hostages from Gaza. In my first term, we achieved one of the most groundbreaking peace agreements in generations, the Abraham Accords. And now we're going to build on that foundation to create a more peaceful and prosperous future for the entire region.\n\nInterestingly, Trump did not mention his controversial and seriously out - of - the - box idea to displace Palestinians and turn Gaza into a sort of R iviera.\n\nA lot of things are happening in the Middle East. People havenât been talking about that so much lately, with everything going on, with Ukraine and Russia. But a lot of things are happening in the Middle East â it's a rough neighborhood, actually.\n\nI'm also working tirelessly to end the savage conflict in Ukraine. Millions of Ukrainians and Russians have been needlessly killed or wounded in this horrific and brutal conflict, with no end in sight. The United States has sent hundreds of billions of dollars to support Ukraine's defense, with no security, with no energy.\n\nDo you want to keep it going for another five years? Yeah, yeah, you would say â Pocahontas says \"yes.\"\n\nâPocahontasâ is Trumpâs insulting nickname for Sen. Elizabeth Warren. She applauded at his comment.\n\nTwo thousand people are being killed every single week â more than that. They're Russian young people, they're Ukrainian young people. They're not Americans, but I want it to stop. Meanwhile, Europe has sadly spent more money buying Russian oil and gas than they have spent on defending Ukraine, by far. Think of that. They've spent more buying Russian oil and gas than they have defending. And we've spent perhaps $350 billion , like taking candy from a baby, that's what happened. And they've spent $100 billion. What a difference that is. And we have an ocean separating us. And they don't. But we're getting along very well with them, and lots of good things are happening.\n\nTrump keeps using the $350 billion figure, but the US has actually spent much less than that. Also, the US has spent less than Europe, according to the Kiel Institute, which has tracked Ukraine aid.\n\nBiden has authorized more money in this fight than Europe has spent by billions and billions of dollars. It's hard to believe that they wouldn't have stopped it and said at some point, come on, let's equalize. You got to be equal to us. But that didn't happen.\n\nEarlier today, I received an important letter from President Zelensky of Ukraine . The letter reads, \"Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer.\" \"Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians,\" he said. \"My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to get a peace that lasts. We do really value how much America has done to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty and independence. Regarding the agreement on minerals and security, Ukraine is ready to sign it at any time that is convenient for you.\"\n\nTrump yelled at Zelensky in the Oval Office less than a week ago; this week, he paused US military aid to Ukraine. Trump has clearly pivoted toward Russia and away from Europe, but news of Zelenskyâs letter is a major development.\n\nI appreciate that he sent this letter, just got it a little while ago. Simultaneously, we've had serious discussions with Russia and have received strong signals that they are ready for peace. Wouldn't that be beautiful? Wouldn't that be beautiful?\n\nIt's time to stop this madness. It's time to halt the killing. It's time to end this senseless war. If you want to end wars, you have to talk to both sides.\n\nNearly four years ago, amid rising tensions, a history teacher named Marc Fogel was detained in Russia and sentenced to 14 years in a penal colony. Rough stuff.\n\nThe US released a Russian money launderer in exchange for Fogel .\n\nThe previous administration barely lifted a finger to help him. They knew he was innocent, but they had no idea where to begin. But last summer I promised his 95-year-old mother, Malphine, that we would bring her boy safely back home. After 22 days in office, I did just that, and they are here tonight.\n\nTo Marc and his great mom, we are delighted to have you safe and sound and with us.\n\nAs fate would have it, Marc Fogel was born in a small rural town â in Butler, Pennsylvania. Have you heard of it? Where his mother has lived for the past 78 years. I just happened to go there last July 13th for a rally. That was not pleasant.\n\nAnd that is where I met his beautiful mom right before I walked onto that stage.\n\nAnd I told her I would not forget what she said about her son. And I never did, did I? Never forgot.\n\nLess than 10 minutes later, at that same rally, gunfire rang out and a sick and deranged assassin unloaded eight bullets from his sniper's perch into a crowd of many thousands of people.\n\nMy life was saved by a fraction of an inch , but some were not so lucky.\n\nThe story of Trumpâs near-assassination is incredible.\n\nCorey Comperatore was a firefighter, a veteran, a Christian, a husband, a devoted father, and above all, a protector.\n\nWhen the sound of gunshots pierced the air, it was a horrible sound. Corey knew instantly what it was and what to do. He threw himself on top of his wife and daughters and shielded them from the bullets with his own body.\n\nCorey was hit really hard. You know the story from there. He sacrificed his life to save theirs. Two others, very fine people, were also seriously hit, but thankfully, with the help of two great country doctors â we thought they were gone, and they were saved, so those doctors had great talent â weâre joined by Corey's wife, Helen, who was his high school sweetheart, and their two beloved daughters, Allyson and Kaylee.\n\nThank you.\n\nTo Helen, Allyson and Kaylee, Corey is looking down on his three beautiful ladies right now and he is cheering you on. He loves you. He is cheering you on. Corey was taken from us much too soon, but his destiny was to leave us all with a shining example of the selfless devotion of a true American patriot.\n\nIt was love like Corey's that built our country, and itâs love like Corey's that is going to make our country more majestic than ever before. I believe that my life was saved that day in Butler for a very good reason. I was saved by God to make America great again. I believe that.\n\nMany of his supporters agree that he survived through divine intervention.\n\nThank you. Thank you. Thank you.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nFrom the patriots of Lexington and Concord to the heroes of Gettysburg and Normandy; from the warriors who crossed the Delaware to the trailblazers who climbed the Rockies; and from the legends who soared at Kitty Hawk to the astronauts who touched the moon, Americans have always been the people who defied all odds, transcended all dangers, made the most extraordinary sacrifices, and did whatever it took to defend our children, our country, and our freedom.\n\nAnd as we have seen in this chamber tonight, that same strength, faith, love and spirit is still alive and thriving in the hearts of the American people.\n\nTrump veers away from the insults, division and campaign speech language he dished out earlier in the speech to end on an inspiring note.\n\nDespite the best efforts of those who would try to censor us, silence us, break us, destroy us, Americans are today a proud, free, sovereign and independent nation that will always be free, and we will fight for it till death.\n\nWe will never let anything happen to our beloved country because we are a country of doers, dreamers, fighters and survivors.\n\nOur ancestors crossed a vast ocean, strode into the unknown wilderness, and carved their fortunes from the rock and soil of a perilous and very dangerous frontier.\n\nThey chased our destiny across a boundless continent.\n\nThey built the railroads, laid the highways, and graced the world with American marvels like the Empire State Building, the mighty Hoover Dam, and the towering Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nThey lit the world with electricity, broke free of the force of gravity, fired up the engines of American industry, vanquished the communists, fascists and Marxists all over the world, and gave us countless modern wonders sculpted out of iron, glass and steel.\n\nWe stand on the shoulders of these pioneers who won and built the modern age.\n\nThese workers who poured their sweat into the skylines of our cities.\n\nThese warriors who shed their blood on fields of battle and gave everything they had for our rights and for our freedom.\n\nNow it is our time to take up the righteous cause of American liberty. And it is our turn to take America's destiny into our own hands and begin the most thrilling days in the history of our country.\n\nThis will be our greatest era. With God's help over the next four years, we are going to lead this nation even higher.\n\nAnd we are going to forge the freest, most advanced, most dynamic and most dominant civilization ever to exist on the face of this Earth.\n\nWe are going to create the highest quality of life, build the safest and wealthiest and healthiest and most vital communities anywhere in the world.\n\nWe are going to conquer the vast frontiers of science, and we are going to lead humanity into space and plant the American flag on the planet Mars , and even far beyond.\n\nWhen he said Mars, there was a yell of approval. Elon Musk? Trumpâs first term was marked by an effort to return to the moon. Musk would prefer to focus on Mars .\n\nAnd through it all, we are going to rediscover the unstoppable power of the American spirit. And we are going to renew unlimited promise of the American dream. Every single day we will stand up and we will fight, fight, fight for the country our citizens believe in, and for the country our people deserve.\n\nMy fellow Americans, get ready for an incredible future because the golden age of America has only just begun.\n\nIt will be like nothing that has ever been seen before. Thank you. God bless you and God bless America."

      "text": "Trumpâs inaugural address, annotated and fact-checked\n\nBy Zachary B. Wolf and Curt Merrill , CNN\n\nPublished January 20, 2025\n\nPresident Donald Trump completed his incredible comeback by delivering his second inaugural address in the rotunda of the US Capitol. Before closing with a pledge to bind the nation and unify Americans, he borrowed lines from his campaign speeches and he promised broad changes in US government, to guard against an invasion at the southern border and to rename the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nHereâs Trumpâs second inaugural address with context and with multiple fact checks from CNNâs Fact Check team .\n\nThank you. Thank you very much, everybody. Well, thank you very, very much.\n\nVice President Vance, Speaker Johnson, Senator Thune, Chief Justice Roberts, justices of the United States Supreme Court, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, President Biden, Vice President Harris, and my fellow citizens:\n\nThe golden age of America begins right now. From this day forward, our country will flourish and be respected again all over the world. We will be the envy of every nation, and we will not allow ourselves to be taken advantage of any longer.\n\nDuring every single day of the Trump administration, I will, very simply, put America first.\n\nTrump has a second chance to deliver on his promise to âMake America Great Again.â He argues that him simply taking office is a step in the right direction.\n\nOur sovereignty will be reclaimed. Our safety will be restored. The scales of justice will be rebalanced.\n\nThis is a clear reference to the US-Mexico border. Trump has promised to quickly address immigration with executive orders now that he is in office.\n\nThe vicious, violent and unfair weaponization of the justice department and our government will end . And our top priority will be to create a nation that is proud, prosperous and free. America will soon be greater, stronger, and far more exceptional than ever before.\n\nThe speech begins with nods to the previous Biden administration, which Trump accused of using the Justice Department against him. Democrats argue that independent prosecutors and grand juries brought the charges against Trump; those cases have since dismissed .\n\nI return to the presidency confident and optimistic that we are at the start of a thrilling new era of national success. A tide of change is sweeping the country. Sunlight is pouring over the entire world. And America has the chance to seize this opportunity like never before.\n\nBut first, we must be honest about the challenges we face. While they are plentiful, they will be annihilated by this great momentum that the world is now witnessing in the United States of America.\n\nAs we gather today, our government confronts a crisis of trust . For many years, a radical and corrupt establishment has extracted power and wealth from our citizens, while the pillars of our society lay broken and seemingly in complete disrepair.\n\nThe drop of confidence and trust of US government institutions is undeniable and evident in polling. This discontent extends across both parties, but is especially true among Republicans .\n\nTrump has promised to completely reform and remake elements of the federal government, with his plan for a Department of Government Efficiency . This message echoes what he said in his first inaugural address. These words sound similar to things Trump might say at a campaign rally, but in the Rotunda, they are being delivered in a strict monotone.\n\nWe now have a government that cannot manage even a simple crisis at home, while at the same time stumbling into a continuing catalog of catastrophic events abroad.\n\nIt fails to protect our magnificent, law abiding American citizens, but provides sanctuary and protection for dangerous criminals, many from prisons and mental institutions, that have illegally entered our country from all over the world.\n\nCongress is currently considering legislation that would provide for the detention of migrants accused of theft of burglary. It could be the first law passed this session.\n\nTrump delivered a softer version of his standard rally claim that foreign governments are deliberately emptying prisons and mental institutions to send people to the US as migrants.\n\nWe have a government that has given unlimited funding to the defense of foreign borders, but refuses to defend American borders or, more importantly, its own people.\n\nOur country can no longer deliver basic services in times of emergency, as recently shown by the wonderful people of North Carolinaâbeen treated so badly . And other states who are still suffering from a hurricane that took place many months ago.\n\nOr more recently, Los Angeles, where we are watching fires still tragically burn from weeks ago without even a token of defense. They're raging through the houses and communities, even affecting some of the wealthiest and most powerful individuals in our country, some of whom are sitting here right now. They don't have a home any longer. That's interesting. But we can't let this happen. Everyone is unable to do anything about it. That's going to change.\n\nFlooding in North Carolina, hurricanes in Florida and wildfires in Los Angeles have led to bipartisan criticism of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA.\n\nScientists say climate change has contributed to more frequent natural disasters, but Trump, who does not believe in the climate crisis, does not mention it here.\n\nWe have a public health system that does not deliver in times of disaster, yet more money is spent on it than any country anywhere in the world.\n\nAnd we have an education system that teaches our children to be ashamed of themselves , in many cases to hate our country despite the love that we try so desperately to provide to them.\n\nFrustration with public education and diversity efforts in the public education system have been a motivating factor for Republicans. The federal government does not generally dictate local education curricula, though it does, through the Department of Education, provide funds to schools and districts. Trump has proposed axing the department .\n\nAll of this will change starting today, and it will change very quickly.\n\nMy recent election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal, and all of these many betrayals, that have taken place, and to give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy, and indeed, their freedom.\n\nFrom this moment on, America's decline is over.\n\nOur liberties and our nation's glorious destiny will no longer be denied, and we will immediately restore the integrity, competency and loyalty of America's government.\n\nOver the past eight years, I have been tested and challenged more than any president in our 250-year history. And I've learned a lot along the way. The journey to reclaim our republic has not been an easy one, that I can tell you.\n\nTrump has certainly faced challenges. But wartime presidents like Franklin D. Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln or the multiple presidents who were assassinated might disagree with him.\n\nThose who wish to stop our cause have tried to take my freedom, and indeed to take my life. Just a few months ago, in a beautiful Pennsylvania field, an assassin's bullet ripped through my ear. But I felt then, and believe even more so now, that my life was saved for a reason: I was saved by God to make America great again.\n\nThank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.\n\nTrump is equating the American justice system with an attempted assassin, who died at the scene of the attempt and whose motives may never be known.\n\nTrump has never been seen as the most religious of presidents, but he and his followers see divine intervention in the fact that he survived an assassinâs bullet in Pennsylvania last summer.\n\nThat is why each day under our administration of American patriots, we will be working to meet every crisis with dignity and power and strength. We will move with purpose and speed to bring back hope, prosperity, safety and peace for citizens of every race, religion, color and creed.\n\nFor American citizens, January 20, 2025, is liberation day.\n\nThis is wartime language. Trump suggests Americans have been under siege until today.\n\nIt is my hope that our recent presidential election will be remembered as the greatest and most consequential election in the history of our country.\n\nAs our victory showed, the entire nation is rapidly unifying behind our agenda with dramatic increases in support from virtually every element of our society â young and old, men and women, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, urban, suburban, rural â and very importantly, we had a powerful win in all seven swing states. And the popular vote we won by millions of people.\n\nIn a CNN poll , a majority 55% said they approved of the way heâs handing the transition. Thatâs a much stronger position than in 2017, but this is also his moment of peak power. History suggests these approval ratings will fall at least somewhat. Itâs also worth remembering that while Trump did win the national vote and made inroads across many of the groups he mentioned, he did not win 50% of the vote in November.\n\nTo the Black and Hispanic communities, I want to thank you for the tremendous outpouring of love and trust that you have shown me with your vote. We set records and I will not forget it. I've heard your voices in the campaign and I look forward to working with you in the years to come.\n\nToday is Martin Luther King Day and his honor â this will be a great honor â but in his honor, we will strive together to make his dream a reality . We will make his dream come true.\n\nMartin Luther King Jr.âs â I H ave a Dream â speech envisioned equality. Trump is also promising to end government programs to promote diversity and inclusion.\n\nThank you. Thank you.\n\nNational unity is now returning to America, and confidence and pride is soaring like never before. In everything we do, my administration will be inspired by a strong pursuit of excellence and unrelenting success.\n\nWe will not forget our country. We will not forget our Constitution. And we will not forget our God . We can't do that.\n\nTrump places the Constitution, which does not mention the word âGod,â in the same breath as faith in a higher power.\n\nRelated article: How Trump will test the Constitution\n\nToday, I will sign a series of historic executive orders. With these actions, we will begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense. It's all about common sense.\n\nFirst, I will declare a national emergency at our southern border. All illegal entry will immediately be halted. And we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came.\n\nThis is an action likely to get broad bipartisan agreement.\n\nWe will reinstate my remain in Mexico policy. I will end the practice of catch and release . And I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country.\n\nâCatch and releaseâ is the policy by which migrants can be released into the country while they are awaiting an immigration hearing. Where and how the United States could keep detained migrants is not clear. Some Trump aides have talked about the need for mass detention camps.\n\nDoes he mean sending active duty troops or the National Guard? These are important distinctions.\n\nUnder the orders I sign today, we will also be designating the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. And by invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 , I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to US soil, including our cities and inner cities.\n\nTrump considered this action during his first term. It could add additional strain to the US relationship with Mexico and create difficulties for American companies doing business in Mexico.\n\nRead more about the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 , which is meant to guard against invasion by a foreign nation or government. Trumpâs effort is likely to face a court battle.\n\nAs commander in chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions, and that is exactly what I am going to do. We will do it at a level that nobody has ever seen before.\n\nNext, I will direct all members of my cabinet to marshal the vast powers at their disposal to defeat what was record inflation , and rapidly bring down costs and prices. The inflation crisis was caused by massive overspending and escalating energy prices , and that is why today I will also declare a national energy emergency. We will drill, baby, drill.\n\nTrump falsely claimed the US experienced ârecord inflationâ during the Biden administration. Trump could fairly say the US inflation rate hit a 40-year high in June 2022, when it was 9.1%, but that was not close to the all-time record of 23.7%, set in 1920 . (And the rate has since plummeted. The most recent available inflation rate at the time Trump spoke here was 2.9% in December .)\n\nObjectively speaking, the inflation crisis was also caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, which began during Trumpâs first term.\n\nThereâs little difference between Trumpâs second inaugural address and the stump speech he often delivered on the campaign trail.\n\nAmerica will be a manufacturing nation once again, and we have something that no other manufacturing nation will ever have: the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on Earth. And we are going to use it.\n\nThe United States is already producing more oil than any country in history.\n\nWe will bring prices down, fill our strategic reserves up again, right to the top, and export American energy all over the world. We will be a rich nation again, and it is that liquid gold under our feet that will help to do it.\n\nWith my actions today, we will end the Green New Deal and we will revoke the electric vehicle mandate , saving our auto industry and keeping my sacred pledge to our great American auto workers.\n\nThe Green New Deal was never enacted, but Democrats pushed through legislation to address climate change as part of the Inflation Reduction Act . By electric vehicle mandate , Trump is referring to tailpipe rules meant to boost EVs, but not require them.\n\nIn other words, you'll be able to buy the car of your choice. We will build automobiles in America again at a rate that nobody could have dreamt possible just a few years ago. And thank you to the auto workers of our nation for your inspiring vote of confidence. We did tremendously with their vote.\n\nI will immediately begin the overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers and families.\n\nInstead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff, and tax, foreign countries to enrich our citizens.\n\nTariffs imposed by the US government are paid by US importers, not foreign countries, and itâs easy to find specific examples of companies that passed along the cost of the tariffs to US consumers. Study after study , including one from the federal governmentâs bipartisan US International Trade Commission , found that Americans bore almost the entire cost of Trumpâs tariffs on Chinese products in his first term. â From CNNâs Alicia Wallace and Daniel Dale\n\nFor this purpose, we are establishing the External Revenue Service to collect all tariffs, duties and revenues. It will be massive amounts of money pouring into our treasury, coming from foreign sources.\n\nâ¦As opposed to the Internal Revenue Service, which collects income taxes from American citizens.\n\nThe American dream will soon be back and thriving like never before. To restore competence and effectiveness to our federal government. My administration will establish the brand new Department of Government Efficiency .\n\nThis is not an official government agency, created through law, but an advisory panel led by Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and Ohio tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nAfter years and years of illegal and unconstitutional federal efforts to restrict free expression, I will also sign an executive order to immediately stop all government censorship and bring back free speech to America.\n\nFree speech is a main issue for Republicans at the moment. Trump could be referring to social media companies. He could be referring to TikTok, which needs to find a US owner in order to continue operation in this country. It could also be a reference to efforts and perhaps overreach by the Biden administration to control the spread of misinformation online during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nNever again will the immense power of the state be weaponized to persecute political opponents â something I know something about . We will not allow that to happen. It will not happen again. Under my leadership, we will restore fair, equal and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law. And we are going to bring law and order back to our cities.\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump had promised to go after his political enemies, naming several Democrats. Many were issued last-minute preemptive pardons by Biden, as were members of his family.\n\nThis week I will also end the government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life. We will forge a society that is colorblind and merit based.\n\nAs of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female.\n\nOpposing trans rights, particularly in the area of womenâs sports, has been a major promise of Republicans.\n\nThis week, I will reinstate any service members who were unjustly expelled from our military for objecting to the Covid vaccine mandate, with full back pay.\n\nThis pledge could affect more than 8,000 veterans, but Biden already offered these service members reinstatement as part of a 2024 defense authorization bill.\n\nAnd I will sign an order to stop our warriors from being subjected to radical political theories and social experiments while on duty. It's going to end immediately. Our armed forces will be freed to focus on their sole mission: defeating America's enemies.\n\nLike in 2017, we will again build the strongest military the world has ever seen. We will measure our success not only by the battles we win, but also by the wars that we end, and perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into.\n\nMy proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier. That's what I want to be: a peacemaker and a unifier.\n\nTrump has promised to end Russiaâs war on Ukraine, but that could require Ukraine ceding some of the ground Russia claimed with its invasion.\n\nI'm pleased to say that as of yesterday, one day before I assumed office, the hostages in the Middle East are coming back home to their families.\n\nBoth the Biden and incoming Trump administrations worked to secure the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel.\n\nThank you.\n\nAmerica will reclaim its rightful place as the greatest, most powerful, most respected nation on Earth, inspiring the awe and admiration of the entire world.\n\nA short time from now, we are going to be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America , and we will restore the name of a great president, William McKinley, to Mount McKinley , where it should be and where it belongs.\n\nThe body of water to the south of the US has been referred to as the Gulf of Mexico for hundreds of years. When Trump said this, former Secretary of State and political opponent Hillary Clinton could be seen laughing in surprise behind him.\n\nIt was President Barack Obama, working with Republicans in Alaska, who changed the mountainâs name. Republican senators from Alaska counseled Trump not to change the mountainâs name in 2017.\n\nPresident McKinley made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent. He was a natural businessman and gave Teddy Roosevelt the money for many of the great things he did, including the Panama Canal, which has foolishly been given to the country of Panama after the United StatesâThe United States, I mean, think of thisâspent more money than ever spent on a project before, and lost 38,000 lives in the building of the Panama Canal.\n\nThe McKinley tariffs were imposed when McKinley was a lawmaker in Congress. McKinley later turned against tariffs as a popular president before he was assassinated.\n\nWe have been treated very badly from this foolish gift that should have never been made. And Panama's promise to us has been broken. The purpose of our deal and the spirit of our treaty has been totally violated.\n\nAmerican ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form, and that includes the United States Navy. And above all, China is operating the Panama Canal. And we didn't give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and we're taking it back.\n\nTrumpâs focus on reclaiming the Panama Canal in recent weeks has come as something of a surprise. He once owned property in Panama. The canal was given to Panama during the Carter administration, decades after the United States completed construction on it.\n\nAnd above all, my message to Americans today is that it is time for us to once again act with courage, vigor and the vitality of history's greatest civilization . So as we liberate our nation, we will lead it to new heights of victory and success. We will not be deterred.\n\nBringing back the idea of American exceptionalism! Trump is already selling his administration as a âGolden Ageâ in US history.\n\nTogether, we will end the chronic disease epidemic and keep our children safe, healthy and disease free.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., the vaccine skeptic and advocate for healthier food whom Trump has tapped to lead the Health and Human Services Department, made addressing the âchronic disease epidemicâ a major thrust of his presidential campaign before he dropped out and endorsed Trump.\n\nThe United States will once again consider itself a growing nation; one that increases our wealth, expands our territory, builds our cities, raises our expectations and carries our flag into new and beautiful horizons.\n\nAnd we will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars, launching American astronauts to plant the stars and stripes on the planet Mars.\n\nMusk, the SpaceX CEO who helped bankroll Trumpâs 2024 campaign, could be seen cheering these words and giving a thumbs up near Trump.\n\nAmbition is the lifeblood of a great nation, and right now, our nation is more ambitious than any other. There's no nation like our nation. Americans are explorers, builders, innovators, entrepreneurs and pioneers.\n\nThe spirit of the frontier is written into our hearts. The call of the next great adventure resounds from within our souls.\n\nThis kind of uplifting prose is more common in an inaugural address.\n\nOur American ancestors turned a small group of colonies on the edge of a vast continent into a mighty republic of the most extraordinary citizens on Earth. No one comes close.\n\nAmericans pushed thousands of miles through a rugged land of untamed wilderness. They crossed deserts, scaled mountains, braved untold dangers, won the wild west, ended slavery, rescued millions from tyranny, lifted billions from poverty, harnessed electricity, split the atom, launched mankind into the heavens and put the universe of human knowledge into the palm of the human hand.\n\nIf we work together, there is nothing we cannot do and no dream we cannot achieve.\n\nMany people thought it was impossible for me to stage such a historic political comeback. But as you see today, here I amâthe American people have spoken.\n\nI stand before you now as proof that you should never believe that something is impossible to do. In America, the impossible is what we do best.\n\nTrumpâs comeback â from twice-impeached and disgraced former president in the wake of January 6, 2021, to assassination survivor and winner of the popular vote in 2024 â is nothing short of miraculous.\n\nFrom New York to Los Angeles, from Philadelphia to Phoenix, from Chicago to Miami, from Houston to right here in Washington, D.C., our country was forged and built by the generations of patriots who gave everything they had for our rights and for our freedom.\n\nThey were farmers and soldiers, cowboys and factory workers, steelworkers and coal miners, police officers and pioneers who pushed onward and marched forward and let no obstacle defeat their spirit or their pride. Together they laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, built great highways, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and triumphed over every single challenge that they faced.\n\nAfter all we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the four greatest years in American history . With your help, we will restore America's promise. And we will rebuild the nation that we love, and we love it so much.\n\nLetâs hope so! Although Trump will claim they are the greatest years no matter what happens.\n\nWe are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. So to every parent who dreams for their child and every child who dreams for their future: I am with you, I will fight for you and I will win for you . We are going to win like never before.\n\nHereâs the message of unity.\n\nThank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\n\nIn recent years, our nation has suffered greatly, but we are going to bring it back and make it great againâgreater than ever before. We will be a nation like no other: full of compassion, courage and compassion, courage and exceptionalism. Our power will stop all wars and bring a new spirit of unity to a world that has been angry, violent, and totally unpredictable.\n\nThis is an interesting argument from a president who has promised a nationalist and America First foreign policy and who has questioned international organizations.\n\nAmerica will be respected again and admired again, including by people of religion, faith, and goodwill.\n\nWe will be prosperous. We will be proud. We will be strong and we will win like never before.\n\nWe will not be conquered. We will not be intimidated. We will not be broken. And we will not fail.\n\nFrom this day on, the United States of America will be a free, sovereign and independent nation.\n\nWe will stand bravely. We will live proudly. We will dream boldly. And nothing will stand in our way because we are Americans. The future is ours, and our golden age has just begun.\n\nThank you. God bless America."

      "text": "Trump aide says tariffs will raise $6 trillion, which would be largest tax hike in US history\n\nMarkets\n\nHot Stocks\n\nFear & Greed Index\n\nLatest Market News\n\nHot Stocks\n\nFollow:\n\nWhite House aide Peter Navarro said Sunday that he expects President Donald Trump's tariffs to bring in $6 trillion in revenue in the next decade, which could amount to the largest tax hike in US history.\n\nEven when adjusting for inflation, that amount would be triple the tax increase put in place in 1942 to pay the cost of fighting World War II.\n\nNavarro, Trump's senior counselor for trade and manufacturing, insists it's not a tax increase but a tax cut - echoing the Trump administration's repeated belief that tariffs will be paid not by American consumers but by businesses in other countries or the countries themselves.\n\n\"The message is that tariffs are tax cuts, tariffs are jobs, tariffs are national security,\" Navarro said on Fox News Sunday. \"Tariffs are great for America. They will make America great again.\"\n\nBut most economists say US-imposed tariffs are paid by American businesses and consumers in the form of higher prices on imported goods, not paid by foreigners.\n\nTrump plans to announce additional tariffs on Wednesday, which he has dubbed \" Liberation Day ,\" on all manner of imported goods as retaliation for what he sees as unfair barriers to US exports to other countries. Trump has already announced tariffs on all goods from China, Mexico and Canada, and this week a 25% tariff on all imported cars is set to take effect.\n\nNavarro said the tariffs will set the stage for tax cuts to be passed by Congress later this year, But the tariff revenue figures that Navarro quoted would be a huge tax increase for Americans in the short term, if they happen.\n\nThe non-auto tariffs alone \"are going to raise about $600 billion (a year), about $6 trillion over a 10-year period,\" Navarro said. Cars, he said, would add another $100 billion annually.\n\nIt's not clear how Navarro calculated this $700 billion annual figure, since the details of these tariffs have yet to be fully disclosed. It's also not clear, and perhaps unlikely, that Americans will continue to buy as many imported goods if prices are hiked due to the cost of the tariffs.\n\nTo reach Navarro's estimate, it would take a 25% tariff on virtually all $3.3 trillion in goods imported by US businesses and consumers in 2024. And that's not going to happen.\n\nCanadian energy imports will be hit with a 10% tariff, not 25%, and Canada is the largest source of the nation's petroleum imports. Chinese goods mostly will have a 20% tariff. In addition, Trump has said not all goods would be hit by tariffs - only goods from countries that have what the administration considers to have \"unfair\" trade policies towards the United States.\n\nWhat's more, Trump's on-again-off-again approach to tariffs so far means the effective rate may not be able to bring in $700 billion regardless. Timeframes for levying them may be delayed, and some countries may reach deals with the Trump administration to eliminate tariffs, for example.\n\nPlus, the $6 trillion figure implies that Americans wouldn't change their purchasing behavior. That's exactly what the tariffs are intended to do: Get consumers to buy American (and get foreign and multinational businesses to shift production to new US factories).\n\nSo at this stage, it's simply not possible to know exactly how much revenue America will bring in from tariffs.\n\nBut even if Navarro's proposed figure is hugely inflated, the cost of tariffs on a dollar basis is still likely to represent a huge tax increase unlike anything seen in US history.\n\nOn a percentage basis, the 1942 tax bill that raised money to fight World War II is the largest tax increase in US history, according to a 2006 analysis by the Treasury Department . That raised $10 billion a year in 1942, or $200 billion today when adjusted for inflation.\n\nHowever, at the time, that tax increase was a much larger share of the nation's gross domestic product, the broad measure of the nation's economic activity. It equaled about 5% of 1942's GDP according to the Treasury Department analysis; today, $600 billion would be only about 2% of current GDP.\n\nOn a dollar basis, the largest previous increase - not adjusted for inflation - is the Affordable Care Act. Also known as Obamacare , the ACA was passed in 2009 and at that time was projected to raise tax revenue by $486 billion.\n\nBut that was over a 10-year period - less in a decade than Navarro is predicting Trump's tariffs will raise in one year. What's more: One of those increases in taxes under the ACA, a penalty on those Americans who didn't get health insurance, was later repealed by Congress, reducing the tax impact of that law.\n\nCritics of the Trump administration's tariff plans say they will create tremendous cost increases for American consumers and will be a drag on the economy.\n\n\"That is a tax,\" said Sen. Mark Warner in an interview on Fox immediately after Navarro's appearance. \"That money doesn't come falling out of the sky. That money comes because (the price of) these products will go up, Americans will pay more. We're talking a $700 billion tax,\" he said, adding the $100 billion that Navarro says auto-specific tariffs will raise in the first year.\n\n\"It insults the intelligence of the American people when he's saying the government is going to collect $700 billion a year,\" he said, \"and somehow that's not going to show up in costs.\"\n\nThe auto industry has been a major focus for the Trump administration in its strategy to increase tariffs.\n\n\"We're going to raise about $100 billion with the auto tariffs alone,\" Navarro predicted Sunday.\n\nRelated article How Trump's car tariffs will impact Americans, in 3 charts\n\nIn addition to the 25% tariff on all imported cars announced last week and scheduled to take effect this week, Trump has said he plans soon to impose additional tariffs on imported auto parts, which are used in every car built at a US assembly plant.\n\nNavarro said the administration then plans to provide tax credits to people who buy \"American\" cars. He did not specify what car purchases would qualify for such a tax credit. No car built at a US auto assembly plant is made with only American parts. Most depend on imported parts for more than half of their content.\n\nAlthough Navarro says these levies will force automakers to s﻿hift production to US plants and create jobs here, experts and auto industry executives say that change would take years to accomplish, if it happens at all. In the meantime, US auto jobs could be lost .\n\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS. US market indices are shown in real time, except for the S&P 500 which is refreshed every two minutes.

      "text": "Why Trump's MAGA hats have become a potent symbol of racism\n\nEditor's Note: Issac Bailey was the 2016 James K. Batten Professor of Public Policy at Davidson College. He was a 2014 Harvard University Nieman fellow and is the author of \" My Brother Moochie: Regaining Dignity in the Midst of Crime, Poverty, and Racism in the American South \" (Other Press). Follow him on Twitter: @ijbailey . The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author; view more opinion articles on CNN.\n\nIt matters that they wore \"Make America Great Again\" hats.\n\nI'm talking about those high school kids in the video that went viral over the weekend , the one that showed the young men laughing and jeering while an older American Indian man drummed and sang. It seemed at first to be an obvious case of white bros acting shamefully, but then another, longer video showed the same encounter with more context and new characters - a racist fringe group of black men, who identify as members of the Hebrew Israelites, and who seemed to have been the main provokers of tension and aggression.\n\nThis twist in the story gave the whole country a case of interpretive whiplash, feeding frenzied new rounds of argument over who the real victims were, and who was being disgraceful to whom.\n\nBut that's a pointless debate. Based on independent reporting, those students should share in the blame, despite their denials stating they were innocent bystanders.\n\nThe Native American protester could have inadvertently made things worse even if he was sincerely trying to calm things. The Hebrew Israelites hurled insults at just about everyone who crossed their path. We can even ask why there weren't more adult chaperones to counsel those students to do the only sensible thing: shut up and walk away. That would have shown real courage and wisdom.\n\nHave at it. Choose whichever facts that will fuel your outrage. But I won't get involved in that because the debate threatens to obscure a broader, more important truth, that we are living through what feels like a \"back to the back of the bus\" moment for many people of color.\n\nThat's why those MAGA hats matter.\n\nRelated video Troops' signed hats may violate military rule\n\nThat's why it matters that they were young white men representing the Christian faith supposedly for a march to emphasis the sanctity of all life - while wearing those hats.\n\nIt matters that this occurred under a President who won his office by openly spouting bigoted rhetoric, who kicked off his campaign saying Mexican immigrants were rapists and bringing crime, after spending several years spreading the bigoted conspiracy that the first black President wasn't fully American, and who defended white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, as good people.\n\nThat context cannot be divorced from the image of the MAGA hat any more than the Confederate flag can be divorced from the brutality of chattel slavery. And yet, every Donald Trump apologist will try to say otherwise - that it's just a hat, or that it is worn by different people for different reasons. How do I know? Because I've listened to similar excuses in my native South Carolina about those who wear or fly the Confederate flag. They do so to honor their ancestors, I've been told, or to embrace Southern heritage, or because they are exercising their First Amendment rights.\n\nThe MAGA hat, like the Confederate flag, wouldn't elicit outraged reactions if it were only a piece of cloth that harkened back to bygone days never to be relived. But it isn't. It is a signifier for those who believe America was great during some point in the past they dare not name, knowing if they do, it would reveal a time when it was worse for people of color. When was America \"great\"? When millions of black people were slaves? When hundreds of thousands of black men were sold to US companies via convict leasing ? Maybe during the heart of Jim Crow, the height of lynching, or when black people struggling with drug addictions were viewed as criminals to be controlled, not fellow human beings needing help?\n\nRelated article LZ: The tricky lesson of MAGA hat confrontation\n\nThe Confederate flag wouldn't elicit such outrage if that flag didn't fly on statehouse lawns and in statehouse buildings and in other public spaces for so many decades, even into the 21st century. But it did, and does. That MAGA hat wouldn't elicit such outrage if Trump were just a man who used bigotry for his own ends, and a reality TV star instead of President of the United States. But he is President of the United States.\n\nThat truth was underscored by this past weekend's events, which seemed to have begun with a verbal confrontation between white students from a Southern Christian school and a small group of black men most Americans never heard of. The difference between the two: those students represented the demographic that most strongly supports Trump - a man who had the power to essentially steal people's children at the border without knowing whether they would ever be returned to their families   - while the group of black protesters constituted literal street preachers shouting into the wind.\n\nThere's no way to sensibly defend the Hebrew Israelites. Their ugliness fanned the flames that became a storm this past weekend. Still, there's an important element to the relative power represented by the Hebrew Israelites and the students from that mostly-white Catholic high school. Only one of them supports a man who has both spouted hate-filled language and has the power to roll back Obama-era oversight of law enforcement to curtail police brutality and unwanted shootings - and that's the one those students chose to proudly align with.\n\nThat matters.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "How the Trump hat became an icon\n\nThey were everywhere on Inauguration Day.\n\nBright red hats emblazoned with the words \"Make America Great Again\" dominated the crowd celebrating in front of the Capitol. The hats were a powerful reminder of the dramatic change in power about to unfold in Washington and became prized possessions for some of Trump's supporters.\n\nMark Stroman bought five hats from a street vendor for friends back home in Los Angeles, acknowledging the political divide the apparel represented.\n\n\"I think that they brought some divisiveness,\" Stroman said. \"They made a great divide between Democrats and Republicans but I think they made people pay attention, they made people wake up.\"\n\nCampaign swag is easy to dismiss, but Trump's hat captured how his candidacy disrupted and divided the country. Like many things in Trump's campaign, it's hard to conclude there was a grand strategy that led to its success. But its connection with voters - for good or bad - is undeniable.\n\nHere's the story of how the hat became one of the most powerful symbols in modern American politics.\n\nThere were no marketing experts or design research involved in the initial idea for the hat, according to former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski.\n\n\"I think somebody actually sent us a sample,\" Lewandowski told CNN. \"They brought that sample to Donald Trump and he said, 'I like it, let's tweak this, let's do it differently.'\"\n\nRelated article Two very different meanings for two brightly colored hats\n\nLewandowski said they tried out different prototypes, different size fonts and styles before they landed on a keeper. After that, the hats were kept on Trump's plane at all times.\n\nIt was a little more than a month after he announced his candidacy that Trump first donned the hat in public at a campaign event. When he made a much-publicized trip to Laredo, Texas, in July 2015 to visit the US-Mexico border, the hot weather necessitated a more casual look than his usual suit and tie.\n\n\"Just for the sweat factor and other things, he chose to wear the hat,\" Lewandowski said.\n\nAt the time, Trump was caught up in a tornado of controversy, from questioning Sen. John McCain's status as a war hero to speculation about running as a third-party candidate and a Border Patrol union backing out of the visit at the last moment.\n\nA crush of reporters waited for Trump in the small terminal of the airport when Trump's plane touched down.\n\n\"He came around the corner and we all went, 'Oh!,' CNN's Chief Political Correspondent Dana Bash, who covered the event, remembered. \"I really remember it vividly because it was like, 'Oh, of course, he's the master marketer. Why wouldn't he put it on a hat?'\"\n\nTrump briefly visited the border, and talked to the cameras three separate times, holding forth on his signature issue of immigration. In every shot, his brand was impossible to miss.\n\nBash was also surprised to notice Trump was wearing white golf shoes, eliciting a \"crunch crunch\" noise as he walked out to a podium.\n\nThe hat itself may have been a fluke, but the slogan had a deeper history with Trump.\n\nHe started using the phrase as far back as 2011. It took on new meaning for Trump, however, in the wake of Mitt Romney's defeat in 2012. In both style and substance, Trump felt Romney failed to project a positive vision of American strength. Just six days after that election, Trump signed paperwork to trademark the phrase \"Make America Great Again.\"\n\n\"He was in that chair - that iconic chair he has in his office on the 26th floor of Trump Tower - and he looked up and he said, 'My slogan is going to be Make American Great Again,'\" Sam Nunberg, a former campaign aide who helped lay the groundwork for Trump's run, told CNN. \"He looked up at the ceiling with a smirk on his face, and he said, 'And watch, everybody's going to love it.' He was right.\"\n\nTrump's opponent, Hillary Clinton, criticized the slogan as harkening back to an abstract time in American history, calling it a \"cruel fantasy.\" The phrase has been used in the past by Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and even Clinton's husband, Bill Clinton.\n\nBut in the history books, the slogan will belong to Trump.\n\nTrademark applications typically take a long time to process. Trump didn't receive the \"Make America Great Again\" trademark until July 2015, just in time for the trip to Laredo.\n\n\"It's just a disruptive technology,\" Lewandowski told CNN of the campaign hats. \"People who weren't involved in politics, that didn't have a political background, wanted to show their support for something different and their way to do that was to buy hats.\"\n\nThe hats are sold in a range of colors, but Trump has shown an affinity for the red hat, as well as the white hat and a camo-style hat with orange font.\n\nTrump was struck by the ubiquity of the hats, from rallies in rural America to formal GOP donor dinners, Lewandowski says. And yet, for all its resonance with supporters, the design almost seemed like an afterthought.\n\n\"It was un-designed,\" Lindsey Ballant, a designer and adjunct professor at the Maryland College of Art, told CNN. \"It didn't represent what one thinks of when you think of traditional politics in terms of visual messaging, and that's essentially what Trump was as well.\"\n\nThe type is default, Times New Roman, the color design is basic, and the style, sitting oddly high on the head with a slender rope stretching across the front, matches the hats Trump has long worn on his golf courses.\n\n\"In contrast, Hillary's campaign was incredibly thought out. It was elaborate. There was a whole system driven around the simplicity and the beauty of the logo mark,\" Ballant says of Trump's opponent's campaign.\n\nTrump's campaign knew they wanted to capitalize on the popularity of the hat, spending more than $2.8 million on hats from Los Angeles-based company Cali-fame, even as political operatives mocked them.\n\n\"It invited attacks from the left in a way that fit right into what I think the Trump campaign and the Trump organization wanted, which is a clash of those two political civilizations that they believed worked in their favor,\" Republican strategist and CNN contributor Kevin Madden said.\n\nLewandowski said it wasn't easy to find a US company to produce the hats. They sell for $20-$30 and cheaper knock-offs from countries like China and Bangladesh are common.\n\n\"Mr. Trump signs a lot of hats and he knows the difference,\" Lewandowsi told CNN. \"He'd say to me, 'You know, out of 10 hats I signed, eight of them are one of the knock-offs.' He's like, 'How do we get those guys?'\"\n\nCali-fame produces the hats now sold on Trump's website, and the ones seen on his head, but Trump's campaign also bought some hats from companies like Ace Specialties LLC and Maxim Advertising, according to finance reports.\n\nIf one wanders into the small store in the basement of Trump Tower, there is a corner devoted to campaign swag, featuring the classic hat as well as new versions unveiled after the election. The cashier there is careful to turn away any potential buyers who are not US citizens, as a purchase of the hat is considered a campaign contribution for Trump's re-election.\n\nThe hats are a physical connection between Trump and many of his rural and working class supporters, but they also continue to be a target for anti-Trump sentiment, from the many parodies of the hat, to protesters burning one at the inauguration.\n\nNo matter what emotion it inspires, the hat, once described by The New York Times as an \"ironic summer accessory,\" has cemented its place in history. Both a red and white hat sat near the stage, enclosed in glass, at Trump's election night party.\n\n\"If I were ever going to design a Trump presidential library, and somebody said what's the artifact you most want, I would say the original hat of Donald Trump's under glass,\" presidential Douglas Brinkley told CNN. \"The whole campaign can be summed up in his collected Twitters, and that ball cap.\"\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Trump was saying 'Make America Great Again' long before he claims he thought it up\n\nTrump told the Washington Post he coined his famous slogan the day after the 2012 election.\n\nTrump used the phrase as early as December 2011.\n\nIn an interview published Wednesday with the Washington Post, President-elect Donald Trump explained how he thought up and ultimately settled on his now famous campaign slogan, \"Make America Great Again.\"\n\nThe phrase, Trump told the Post, came to him the day after 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney lost the election, while he was sitting in Trump tower mulling a presidential bid of his own. Trump liked the phrase so much, he instructed his lawyers to trademark it.\n\nTrump did indeed seek trademark rights to the term less than a week later, but Trump's history with the phrase goes back much further than the days following the 2012 election.\n\nIn December of 2011, Trump bowed out of moderating a Republican presidential forum sponsored by Newsmax, saying in a statement he was not ready to rule out running as an independent candidate after The Apprentice ended in May 2012.\n\nHis choice of words? \"I must leave all of my options open because, above all else, we must make America great again,\" Trump said.\n\nThe next month, on New Year's Day 2012, reports surfaced of a group of Trump's supporters who had filed for an independent party to appear on the Texas ballot - laying the groundwork for a potential Trump presidential bid.\n\nThe party's name? \"Make America Great Again Party.\"\n\nTrump then took to the airwaves, appearing on Fox News three times over two days. In the interviews, he acknowledged how much he liked the name.\n\nDuring an appearance on Jan. 2, 2012 on Fox and Friends, Trump was asked what he knew about the 'Make America Great Again' Party.\n\n\"Well I just heard about it, in fact, I heard about it on your show, and frankly I think it's a great name 'Make America Great,' because that's what it is all about, making America great,\" Trump replied.\n\nA day later, on On the Record , host Greta Van Susteren again asked him about the \"Make America Great Again\" Party.\n\n\"Well, I do love the name, I think the name of party is fantastic, because that really is what it is all about. America soon will not be great,\" said Trump. \"A lot of people would say right now it is not great.'\n\nThat same day, speaking with Neil Cavuto on Fox Business, Trump once again expressed how much he liked the party name.\n\n\"We could make America great... that's the name of the party that they filed for, and that's the name of the group 'Make America Great.' What a great name for a party, cause that's what it is all about. We have to take this country back. We have to make it great again.\"\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

The hats were a powerful reminder of the dramatic change in power about to unfold in Washington and became prized possessions for some of Trump's supporters.\n\nMark Stroman bought five hats from a street vendor for friends back home in Los Angeles, acknowledging the political divide the apparel represented.\n\n\"I think that they brought some divisiveness,\" Stroman said. \"They made a great divide between Democrats and Republicans but I think they made people pay attention, they made people wake up.\"\n\nCampaign swag is easy to dismiss, but Trump's hat captured how his candidacy disrupted and divided the country. Like many things in Trump's campaign, it's hard to conclude there was a grand strategy that led to its success. But its connection with voters - for good or bad - is undeniable.\n\nHere's the story of how the hat became one of the most powerful symbols in modern American politics.\n\nThere were no marketing experts or design research involved in the initial idea for the hat, according to former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski.\n\n\"I think somebody actually sent us a sample,\" Lewandowski told CNN. \"They brought that sample to Donald Trump and he said, 'I like it, let's tweak this, let's do it differently.'\"\n\nRelated article Two very different meanings for two brightly colored hats\n\nLewandowski said they tried out different prototypes, different size fonts and styles before they landed on a keeper. After that, the hats were kept on Trump's plane at all times.\n\nIt was a little more than a month after he announced his candidacy that Trump first donned the hat in public at a campaign event. When he made a much-publicized trip to Laredo, Texas, in July 2015 to visit the US-Mexico border, the hot weather necessitated a more casual look than his usual suit and tie.\n\n\"Just for the sweat factor and other things, he chose to wear the hat,\" Lewandowski said.\n\nAt the time, Trump was caught up in a tornado of controversy, from questioning Sen. John McCain's status as a war hero to speculation about running as a third-party candidate and a Border Patrol union backing out of the visit at the last moment.\n\nA crush of reporters waited for Trump in the small terminal of the airport when Trump's plane touched down.\n\n\"He came around the corner and we all went, 'Oh!,' CNN's Chief Political Correspondent Dana Bash, who covered the event, remembered. \"I really remember it vividly because it was like, 'Oh, of course, he's the master marketer. Why wouldn't he put it on a hat?'\"\n\nTrump briefly visited the border, and talked to the cameras three separate times, holding forth on his signature issue of immigration. In every shot, his brand was impossible to miss.\n\nBash was also surprised to notice Trump was wearing white golf shoes, eliciting a \"crunch crunch\" noise as he walked out to a podium.\n\nThe hat itself may have been a fluke, but the slogan had a deeper history with Trump.\n\nHe started using the phrase as far back as 2011. It took on new meaning for Trump, however, in the wake of Mitt Romney's defeat in 2012. In both style and substance, Trump felt Romney failed to project a positive vision of American strength. Just six days after that election, Trump signed paperwork to trademark the phrase \"Make America Great Again.\"\n\n\"He was in that chair - that iconic chair he has in his office on the 26th floor of Trump Tower - and he looked up and he said, 'My slogan is going to be Make American Great Again,'\" Sam Nunberg, a former campaign aide who helped lay the groundwork for Trump's run, told CNN. \"He looked up at the ceiling with a smirk on his face, and he said, 'And watch, everybody's going to love it.' He was right.\"\n\nTrump's opponent, Hillary Clinton, criticized the slogan as harkening back to an abstract time in American history, calling it a \"cruel fantasy.\" The phrase has been used in the past by Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and even Clinton's husband, Bill Clinton.\n\nBut in the history books, the slogan will belong to Trump.\n\nTrademark applications typically take a long time to process. Trump didn't receive the \"Make America Great Again\" trademark until July 2015, just in time for the trip to Laredo.\n\n\"It's just a disruptive technology,\" Lewandowski told CNN of the campaign hats. \"People who weren't involved in politics, that didn't have a political background, wanted to show their support for something different and their way to do that was to buy hats.\"\n\nThe hats are sold in a range of colors, but Trump has shown an affinity for the red hat, as well as the white hat and a camo-style hat with orange font.\n\nTrump was struck by the ubiquity of the hats, from rallies in rural America to formal GOP donor dinners, Lewandowski says. And yet, for all its resonance with supporters, the design almost seemed like an afterthought.\n\n\"It was un-designed,\" Lindsey Ballant, a designer and adjunct professor at the Maryland College of Art, told CNN. \"It didn't represent what one thinks of when you think of traditional politics in terms of visual messaging, and that's essentially what Trump was as well.\"\n\nThe type is default, Times New Roman, the color design is basic, and the style, sitting oddly high on the head with a slender rope stretching across the front, matches the hats Trump has long worn on his golf courses.\n\n\"In contrast, Hillary's campaign was incredibly thought out. It was elaborate. There was a whole system driven around the simplicity and the beauty of the logo mark,\" Ballant says of Trump's opponent's campaign.\n\nTrump's campaign knew they wanted to capitalize on the popularity of the hat, spending more than $2.8 million on hats from Los Angeles-based company Cali-fame, even as political operatives mocked them.\n\n\"It invited attacks from the left in a way that fit right into what I think the Trump campaign and the Trump organization wanted, which is a clash of those two political civilizations that they believed worked in their favor,\" Republican strategist and CNN contributor Kevin Madden said.\n\nLewandowski said it wasn't easy to find a US company to produce the hats. They sell for $20-$30 and cheaper knock-offs from countries like China and Bangladesh are common.\n\n\"Mr. Trump signs a lot of hats and he knows the difference,\" Lewandowsi told CNN. \"He'd say to me, 'You know, out of 10 hats I signed, eight of them are one of the knock-offs.' He's like, 'How do we get those guys?'\"\n\nCali-fame produces the hats now sold on Trump's website, and the ones seen on his head, but Trump's campaign also bought some hats from companies like Ace Specialties LLC and Maxim Advertising, according to finance reports.\n\nIf one wanders into the small store in the basement of Trump Tower, there is a corner devoted to campaign swag, featuring the classic hat as well as new versions unveiled after the election. The cashier there is careful to turn away any potential buyers who are not US citizens, as a purchase of the hat is considered a campaign contribution for Trump's re-election.\n\nThe hats are a physical connection between Trump and many of his rural and working class supporters, but they also continue to be a target for anti-Trump sentiment, from the many parodies of the hat, to protesters burning one at the inauguration.\n\nNo matter what emotion it inspires, the hat, once described by The New York Times as an \"ironic summer accessory,\" has cemented its place in history. Both a red and white hat sat near the stage, enclosed in glass, at Trump's election night party.\n\n\"If I were ever going to design a Trump presidential library, and somebody said what's the artifact you most want, I would say the original hat of Donald Trump's under glass,\" presidential Douglas Brinkley told CNN. \"The whole campaign can be summed up in his collected Twitters, and that ball cap.\"\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

But Trump also took delight in pointing out something else about this rarefied group of companies.\n\nThe first initial of each company's stock ticker creates the MAGA acronym, Trump's famous campaign slogan that stands for 'Make America Great Again.'\n\nIn this case, as Trump pointed out, MAGA stands for Microsoft, Apple, Google and Amazon.\n\nHe even had prepared a special sign, titled \"The trillion $ club,\" that displayed the properly arranged names of the four companies for the benefit of the assembled reporters and guests.\n\nMicrosoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Apple have performed extremely well on the stock market this year, generating about 67% of the S&P 500's year-to-date returns.\n\nAn astute reader might note that G in Trump's MAGA club should technically be an A, for Alphabet, the name of Google's parent company. But Alphabet's stock ticker is GOOGL, and Wall Street's custom is to use a G to refer to Alphabet/Google whenever a catchy stock grouping is coined, such as FAANG, or Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google.\n\nFacebook and Netflix didn't make the cut for Trump's trillion's club, and they have a long way to go. Facebook's market cap is only $591 billion while Netflix's is a relatively paltry $164 billion.\n\nTrump touted the four tech companies even as his administration has publicly feuded with several of them. Amazon, whose CEO Jeff Bezos is also the owner of the Washington Post newspaper, has been a particular target of Trump's ire.\n\nAnd hours before Trump's MAGA moment on Tuesday, federal antitrust regulators announced plans to review past acquisitions by the largest tech companies, including all the members of Trump's trillion's club.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Elon Musk says 'Make Europe Great Again' as he continues his push into European politics\n\nElon Musk continues to champion right-wing politics in Europe.\n\nMusk shared an X post on Saturday that invoked President-elect Donald Trump's world-famous campaign slogan, \"Make America Great Again.\"\n\n\"From MAGA to MEGA: Make Europe Great Again!\" the tech billionaire wrote.\n\nIn a separate post, Musk said, \"So many people in Europe lack hope for the future or think Europe is 'bad' in some way. Pervasive pessimism. This will lead to the end of Europe. Therefore, it must change.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Musk did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nMusk has previously promoted right-wing political parties and agendas in Europe, including in a December 2024 op-ed in a prominent German newspaper. The op-ed called the Alternative for Germany party - or AfD - the \"last spark of hope for this country.\"\n\n\"The AfD advocates a controlled immigration policy that gives priority to integration and the preservation of German culture and security. This is not about xenophobia, but about ensuring that Germany does not lose its identity in the pursuit of globalization,\" Musk wrote. \"A nation must preserve its core values and cultural heritage to remain strong and united.\"\n\nThat same month, Musk called German Chancellor Olaf Scholz an \"incompetent fool\" on X and suggested he should resign.\n\nMusk owns a Tesla Gigafactory near Berlin, which has been the source of local tension. Last year, a clash between police and protestors, who said the factory's expansion would deplete local forests and water resources, broke out .\n\nThomas Zittel, a politics professor at Goethe University Frankfurt, told Business Insider that Musk's \"motivation to comment on German party politics may be driven by his own experiences during the construction\" of the factory. He added that there was \"probably too much bureaucracy and regulation for his taste.\"\n\n\"After all, he thinks in terms of disruption,\" Zittel said.\n\nMusk has also waded into UK politics. Earlier this month, he advocated on X for the release of Tommy Robinson , a far-right English agitator. Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, breached a court order not to repeat false claims about a refugee from Syria and was jailed last year. Robinson was sued for defamation over the claims.\n\nFive days later, Musk shared a poll on X asking if America should \"liberate the people of Britain from their tyrannical government.\"\n\nMusk's comments have drawn criticism from political leaders across Europe .\n\nScholz responded to Musk's op-ed during an interview this month. \"There are many people on social media who want to attract attention with strong slogans,\" he said. \"The rule is: Don't feed the troll.\"\n\nUK Prime Minister Keir Starmer also discussed Musk during a speech without naming him this month. \"Those who are spreading lies and misinformation as far and as wide as possible are not interested in victims - they're interested in themselves,\" Starmer said.\n\nJump to"

In short, there's nothing groundbreaking about the hat's design as is, but that's not to say its success was an accident.\n\nIt represented a foil of Trump's political opponents, and this simplicity was stark in the face of his opponent Hillary Clinton's highly orchestrated campaign.\n\n\"In contrast, Hillary's campaign was incredibly thought out. It was elaborate. There was a whole system driven around the simplicity and the beauty of the logo mark,\" Ballant told CNN .\n\nIt seems the simplicity of the hat is what cemented it in the minds of both supporters and detractors alike. The hats were undoubtedly a success, as the Trump campaign bought $2.8 million in hats from the main Los Angeles-based manufacturer, according to CNN's review of campaign documents, and that doesn't even count the large number of knock-off hats produced.\n\nIt certainly had some type of strong appeal, even to Trump's opponents. Groups who didn't support Trump's campaign put their own versions out, like the Human Rights Campaign's \"Make America LGBTQ again\" hat in blue.\n\nThere was even a period in 2015 before Trump's candidacy seemed like it would be successful when the hats were worn ironically in the hippest enclaves of liberal cities, according to the New York Times .\n\nJump to"

The victim sustained minor injuries and declined medical attention,\" said the prosecutor's office in their statement.\n\nA law enforcement source told NBC affiliate News 4 that the alleged attack happened at the ShopRite grocery store on Elizabeth Avenue.\n\nProsecutor's office information officer Jeanne Trillhaase told INSIDER that police plan to release more information later on Wednesday.\n\nMonday's alleged attack is not the first time that MAGA slogan-branded clothing has sparked confrontation.\n\nIn January, a group of students, some wearing MAGA caps, from a Catholic high school in Kentucky were filmed in a tense encounter with a group of Native American protesters in Washington DC.\n\nEarlier in February Rosiane Santos was charged with disorderly conduct after allegedly knocking a MAGA-slogan hat off a man in Massachusetts restaurant, according to CBS affiliate WBZ .\n\nA 16-year-old Trump supporter in Texas last June posted a video of himself being insulted by a man who then threw a soft drink at him and took his MAGA cap from him in a burger restaurant in San Antonio. The man, Kino Jimenez, was subsequently charged with theft .\n\nIn a tweet, the president's son, Donald Trump Jr., described the June attack as \" disgusting and a disgrace.\"\n\n\"No one should feel unsafe supporting their President,\" he added.\n\nFollow INSIDER on Facebook .\n\nJump to"

His slogan was \"Make America Great Again,\" but the lasting image of his term - rioters assaulting the U.S. Capitol and the country's republican form of governance, in his name - was anything but great.\n\nThe failed coup - if it was organized enough to call it that - concluded a presidency that often used Orwellian tools of Newspeak and Doublethink to communicate.\n\n\"This mob was fed lies,\" Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said Tuesday. \"They were provoked by the president and other powerful people.\"\n\nTrump's lies, told up until the end in service of accumulating and maintaining power, were so conspicuous and dangerous that he was booted from the very social media sites that had built his base.\n\nJulian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University, said Trump shook the foundations of the country over four years.\n\n\"He proudly led a radicalized Republican Party and exposed just how extreme the party had become in pursuit of partisan power,\" Zelizer said by email. \"In doing so, he stressed and strained our democratic institutions unlike any other president in recent history, breaking crucial norms of governance and giving legitimacy to extremist voices in our polity.\"\n\nTrump aides have circulated lists of what they say are his achievements in recent days, and the soon-to-be-former president will surely declare his presidency the greatest of all time for years to come. Most Americans say they disagree.\n\nA PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll released Tuesday found that only 16 percent of all adults, and 33 percent of Republicans, think Trump will be remembered as one of the best presidents of all time. Forty-seven percent of adults said his would be seen as one of the worst presidencies ever, including 13 percent of Republicans.\n\nFor most Americans - even in an era of deep and angry partisan division - the human effects of Trump's actions have been too obvious to ignore despite his use of the bully pulpit to distract from his struggles. More than 400,000 people have died of the coronavirus in the U.S. on his watch - after he said the disease would kill only tens of thousands and then just disappear - and medical experts say quicker and more effective leadership from the White House could have done more to contain the spread of the pandemic.\n\nLike most presidents, Trump promised to unify the country. But he proved unable to work across the aisle in Congress. Aside from emergency spending to counter the catastrophic economic and public health effects of the disease - and the trade deal with Mexico and Canada - his policy achievements were limited to actions he could take without Congress' cooperation. That was particularly true after Democrats took control of the House in the 2018 midterm elections, creating a roadblock for his most extreme proposals.\n\nIt may be hard to remember, but he shut down the government for a record 35 days at the end of 2018 and the start of 2019. Trump said he was \"proud\" to \"take the mantle\" of closing large parts of the federal government as he tried unsuccessfully to force Congress to give him money to build his proposed wall on the Mexico border.\n\nUntil his supporters laid siege to the Capitol, that was the clearest evidence of his inability and unwillingness to work with Congress.\n\nStill, as Zelizer noted, Trump was able to put in place stringent immigration restrictions, pass a tax cut when Republicans held both chambers of Congress early in his term, roll back regulations on industry and fill the federal judiciary with conservatives.\n\n\"He advanced core conservative goals,\" Zelizer said.\n\nFrom a historical perspective, Trump's legacy will be marked by a record he set at the end of his term: He was the only president ever impeached twice by the House, and he lost the highest number of his own party's members ever in the second impeachment vote. Ten House Republicans voted to ask the Senate to ban him from holding federal office in the future.\n\nHis first impeachment, which ended in acquittal by the Senate in February, revolved around his withholding of $400 million in congressionally appropriated aid to Ukraine as he tried to get the country to announce an investigation into Joe Biden and Biden's son Hunter. In other words, he was impeached once for using the power of his office to try to help his re-election campaign and a second time for sending a mob to the Capitol to prevent his defeat at the ballot box.\n\nHe will relinquish power against his will, in a cloud of disgrace uncommon to presidents, having failed to deliver on his most often repeated and loudly pronounced promises and in an ongoing state of denial about the nature of the pandemic and his legitimate defeat at the ballot box.\n\n\"He, in every respect, was unworthy to be president,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told MSNBC's Joy Reid in an interview broadcast Tuesday.\n\n\"It's not 'lessons learned,'\" Pelosi said of Trump, \"because it was so evident all along what a disgrace he was.\"\n\nJonathan Allen is a senior national politics reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Just 24% of Americans have positive views of the movement, while 45% voice negative views.\n\nThese numbers come as President Joe Biden made Trump - and his movement - the centerpiece of his re-election launch video on Tuesday.\n\nBiden in his video that \"MAGA extremists are lining up to take those bedrock freedoms away.\" Biden and his fellow Democrats often use the term \"MAGA\" as a catch-all to describe pro-Trump Republicans who embrace the former president's more extreme positions, including his false claims that the 2020 election was stolen.\n\nA slight majority of Republicans - 52% - view the MAGA movement positively, as well as 53% of those who define themselves as conservative.\n\nIndependents also rated the movement negatively, with just 12% viewing it positively, while 45% say they have negative views of the movement.\n\nThe movement received net-positive ratings across only a few political and demographic groups, finding support among those who make up the Republican base, including Americans who are white, less educated and live in rural areas.\n\nMore than a third of rural Americans have positive views of the movement, the highest of any geographic subgroup. And the movement received its highest mark from white Americans, with a 29% positive rating, of any racial subgroup.\n\nMen over the age of 50 were evenly split, with 36% voicing positive views and 37% voicing negative views. And a combined 58% of those with a high school degree or less and those who attended technical or vocational schools view the movement positively.\n\nOn the flip side, the movement received its highest negative ratings from groups that make up the Democratic base: the higher educated, younger people, people of color, particularly Black people, and those who define themselves as liberals.\n\nThe NBC News poll was conducted April 14-18 of 1,000 adults - including 861 reached by cell phone - and it has an overall margin of error of plus-minus 3.1 percentage points.\n\nBridget Bowman is a national political reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "The Symbol Of The MAGA Hat\n\nWashington Post fashion critic Robin Givhan tells NPR's Michel Martin that the MAGA (Make America Great Again) hat is not a fashion statement as much as a statement of identity.\n\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST: OK. Let's talk some more about the hat. You know which one I'm talking about - the red Make America Great Again hat, the MAGA hat. Why is the hat such a big deal? Washington Post fashion and culture critic Robin Givhan has been thinking about that. And she's with us now in our studios in Washington, D.C. Welcome back. Thanks so much for joining us. ROBIN GIVHAN: Thank you. MARTIN: You wrote a whole column about the MAGA hat. You said that the Make America Great Again hat is not a statement of policy anymore. It's a declaration of identity. So, first of all, why do you say that? And what is that identity? GIVHAN: Well, I mean, I think the MAGA hat, you know, did start out as a - you know, as sort of innocuous political swag. And then it came to represent, you know, the Trump administration, the Trump campaign. And people who were wearing it I think were, at that point, focused on various policy ideas, whether it was tax cuts or a point of view when it comes to foreign policy or immigration. But I think what happened is that the hat was essentially kidnapped, weaponized by Charlottesville and by white supremacists and by the violence that went on in some of those rallies by a minority of people at those rallies. But that hat came to I think, in the broader culture, start to represent a lot of really dark forces. And it has come to represent, also, this idea of making America great again as in, oh, it once was great in some distant past. And things happened to make it less great. MARTIN: So political figures have used fashion to make statements before, like Hillary Clinton had the blue pantsuits that then became the white pantsuits because that's something that the suffragists wore. And even though Barack Obama wasn't really known for his fashion, I mean, there were symbols associated with him that people made into fashion. Like, the Shepard Fairey \"Hope\" poster was a thing for a while... GIVHAN: Right. MARTIN: Is it your contention that this is at a different level, it has some broader cultural meaning apart from the political figure itself? GIVHAN: Yeah. I mean, I do think it's different from those things because - the groups and attitudes and sensibilities and moods that it's associated with. And I think, you know, there is this notion that simply because you put on the hat means that, you know, you are all these terrible things. And I don't necessarily think that is the case. And I don't think most people presume that to be the case. But I do think that there's this sense that if you put on that hat, you are knowingly shrouding yourself in something that has all of these dark connotations and, in knowingly doing that, that implies that you're OK with it. MARTIN: Is that symbolism, in your view, equally understood by those who wear it and by those who receive it or see it? GIVHAN: Sometimes not, sometimes it does. I mean, you know, I think, you know, you can look back in - at much darker periods in history, you know? And there are those who might argue that, oh, I'm wearing this because I'm a history buff. But the broader culture at large knows what it means, historically. MARTIN: Well, you draw the analogy to the Confederate flag. GIVHAN: Right. MARTIN: I mean, you say that - in your column, you say that to wear a MAGA hat is to wrap oneself in a Confederate flag, which you also see as a provocation. Now, along those same lines, there are plenty of people who will say, no, it's not. It's a reflection of history. It's a reflection of Southern heritage. It's not meant to be provocative or racist. And to that, would you say, are these people just not willing to be honest about what they're trying to say? GIVHAN: Yeah, I would say that. I mean, I think that if you are making this argument that it is purely a matter of celebrating history, then you have to I believe also recognize the full breadth of that history. And so you can't wear something like a Confederate flag or wave a Confederate flag and say that it only represents this tiny sliver of history when, in fact, there is this really broad history, the bulk of which is pretty negative, at least for a pretty large group of people of color, that, you know - you have to recognize that that is part of the story that you're telling. MARTIN: So tell me a little bit more about what reaction you're getting to the column. GIVHAN: Yeah. I mean, I would say that the reaction is as polarizing as the hat is. The people who agreed with the column are very vocal in expressing that. And then there are people who simply say that, oh, you're reading way too much into the hat, or you, in fact, are a racist because this is what you see in that hat. But I would say that the ones who are perhaps most eloquent in their - the defense of the hat really are the ones who are saying the dark terrible things that you described, do not reflect what's in my heart, do not reflect how I feel about immigrants or how I feel about women, you know? They still feel that the hat is representative of something that goes directly to how they think their government should be run. And, you know, and I say to them that, yes, I understand what your intent is. My argument is that that benign intent has been drowned out, overwhelmed, eradicated by quite a malignant intent. MARTIN: Well, it proves your point, once again, that fashion isn't just fashion. Fashion is communication and culture, right? GIVHAN: Yeah. And it's not simply what you are trying to communicate. It's also - you know, fashion is connected to the broader culture, and all of those outside forces change the meaning of what you wear.

So, first of all, why do you say that? And what is that identity? GIVHAN: Well, I mean, I think the MAGA hat, you know, did start out as a - you know, as sort of innocuous political swag. And then it came to represent, you know, the Trump administration, the Trump campaign. And people who were wearing it I think were, at that point, focused on various policy ideas, whether it was tax cuts or a point of view when it comes to foreign policy or immigration. But I think what happened is that the hat was essentially kidnapped, weaponized by Charlottesville and by white supremacists and by the violence that went on in some of those rallies by a minority of people at those rallies. But that hat came to I think, in the broader culture, start to represent a lot of really dark forces. And it has come to represent, also, this idea of making America great again as in, oh, it once was great in some distant past. And things happened to make it less great. MARTIN: So political figures have used fashion to make statements before, like Hillary Clinton had the blue pantsuits that then became the white pantsuits because that's something that the suffragists wore. And even though Barack Obama wasn't really known for his fashion, I mean, there were symbols associated with him that people made into fashion. Like, the Shepard Fairey \"Hope\" poster was a thing for a while... GIVHAN: Right. MARTIN: Is it your contention that this is at a different level, it has some broader cultural meaning apart from the political figure itself? GIVHAN: Yeah. I mean, I do think it's different from those things because - the groups and attitudes and sensibilities and moods that it's associated with. And I think, you know, there is this notion that simply because you put on the hat means that, you know, you are all these terrible things. And I don't necessarily think that is the case. And I don't think most people presume that to be the case. But I do think that there's this sense that if you put on that hat, you are knowingly shrouding yourself in something that has all of these dark connotations and, in knowingly doing that, that implies that you're OK with it. MARTIN: Is that symbolism, in your view, equally understood by those who wear it and by those who receive it or see it? GIVHAN: Sometimes not, sometimes it does. I mean, you know, I think, you know, you can look back in - at much darker periods in history, you know? And there are those who might argue that, oh, I'm wearing this because I'm a history buff. But the broader culture at large knows what it means, historically. MARTIN: Well, you draw the analogy to the Confederate flag. GIVHAN: Right. MARTIN: I mean, you say that - in your column, you say that to wear a MAGA hat is to wrap oneself in a Confederate flag, which you also see as a provocation. Now, along those same lines, there are plenty of people who will say, no, it's not. It's a reflection of history. It's a reflection of Southern heritage. It's not meant to be provocative or racist. And to that, would you say, are these people just not willing to be honest about what they're trying to say? GIVHAN: Yeah, I would say that. I mean, I think that if you are making this argument that it is purely a matter of celebrating history, then you have to I believe also recognize the full breadth of that history. And so you can't wear something like a Confederate flag or wave a Confederate flag and say that it only represents this tiny sliver of history when, in fact, there is this really broad history, the bulk of which is pretty negative, at least for a pretty large group of people of color, that, you know - you have to recognize that that is part of the story that you're telling. MARTIN: So tell me a little bit more about what reaction you're getting to the column. GIVHAN: Yeah. I mean, I would say that the reaction is as polarizing as the hat is. The people who agreed with the column are very vocal in expressing that. And then there are people who simply say that, oh, you're reading way too much into the hat, or you, in fact, are a racist because this is what you see in that hat. But I would say that the ones who are perhaps most eloquent in their - the defense of the hat really are the ones who are saying the dark terrible things that you described, do not reflect what's in my heart, do not reflect how I feel about immigrants or how I feel about women, you know? They still feel that the hat is representative of something that goes directly to how they think their government should be run. And, you know, and I say to them that, yes, I understand what your intent is. My argument is that that benign intent has been drowned out, overwhelmed, eradicated by quite a malignant intent. MARTIN: Well, it proves your point, once again, that fashion isn't just fashion. Fashion is communication and culture, right? GIVHAN: Yeah. And it's not simply what you are trying to communicate. It's also - you know, fashion is connected to the broader culture, and all of those outside forces change the meaning of what you wear. MARTIN: That's Washington Post fashion and culture critic Robin Givhan, the Pulitzer Prize-winner joining us in our studios in Washington, D.C. Thank you so much for joining us. GIVHAN: Pleasure.

You know which one I'm talking about - the red Make America Great Again hat, the MAGA hat. Why is the hat such a big deal?

And then there are people who simply say that, oh, you're reading way too much into the hat, or you, in fact, are a racist because this is what you see in that hat. But I would say that the ones who are perhaps most eloquent in their - the defense of the hat really are the ones who are saying the dark terrible things that you described, do not reflect what's in my heart, do not reflect how I feel about immigrants or how I feel about women, you know? They still feel that the hat is representative of something that goes directly to how they think their government should be run. And, you know, and I say to them that, yes, I understand what your intent is. My argument is that that benign intent has been drowned out, overwhelmed, eradicated by quite a malignant intent. MARTIN: Well, it proves your point, once again, that fashion isn't just fashion. Fashion is communication and culture, right? GIVHAN: Yeah. And it's not simply what you are trying to communicate. It's also - you know, fashion is connected to the broader culture, and all of those outside forces change the meaning of what you wear. MARTIN: That's Washington Post fashion and culture critic Robin Givhan, the Pulitzer Prize-winner joining us in our studios in Washington, D.C. Thank you so much for joining us. GIVHAN: Pleasure.

And then it came to represent, you know, the Trump administration, the Trump campaign. And people who were wearing it I think were, at that point, focused on various policy ideas, whether it was tax cuts or a point of view when it comes to foreign policy or immigration. But I think what happened is that the hat was essentially kidnapped, weaponized by Charlottesville and by white supremacists and by the violence that went on in some of those rallies by a minority of people at those rallies. But that hat came to I think, in the broader culture, start to represent a lot of really dark forces. And it has come to represent, also, this idea of making America great again as in, oh, it once was great in some distant past. And things happened to make it less great. MARTIN: So political figures have used fashion to make statements before, like Hillary Clinton had the blue pantsuits that then became the white pantsuits because that's something that the suffragists wore. And even though Barack Obama wasn't really known for his fashion, I mean, there were symbols associated with him that people made into fashion. Like, the Shepard Fairey \"Hope\" poster was a thing for a while... GIVHAN: Right. MARTIN: Is it your contention that this is at a different level, it has some broader cultural meaning apart from the political figure itself? GIVHAN: Yeah. I mean, I do think it's different from those things because - the groups and attitudes and sensibilities and moods that it's associated with. And I think, you know, there is this notion that simply because you put on the hat means that, you know, you are all these terrible things. And I don't necessarily think that is the case. And I don't think most people presume that to be the case. But I do think that there's this sense that if you put on that hat, you are knowingly shrouding yourself in something that has all of these dark connotations and, in knowingly doing that, that implies that you're OK with it. MARTIN: Is that symbolism, in your view, equally understood by those who wear it and by those who receive it or see it? GIVHAN: Sometimes not, sometimes it does. I mean, you know, I think, you know, you can look back in - at much darker periods in history, you know? And there are those who might argue that, oh, I'm wearing this because I'm a history buff. But the broader culture at large knows what it means, historically. MARTIN: Well, you draw the analogy to the Confederate flag. GIVHAN: Right. MARTIN: I mean, you say that - in your column, you say that to wear a MAGA hat is to wrap oneself in a Confederate flag, which you also see as a provocation. Now, along those same lines, there are plenty of people who will say, no, it's not. It's a reflection of history. It's a reflection of Southern heritage. It's not meant to be provocative or racist. And to that, would you say, are these people just not willing to be honest about what they're trying to say? GIVHAN: Yeah, I would say that. I mean, I think that if you are making this argument that it is purely a matter of celebrating history, then you have to I believe also recognize the full breadth of that history. And so you can't wear something like a Confederate flag or wave a Confederate flag and say that it only represents this tiny sliver of history when, in fact, there is this really broad history, the bulk of which is pretty negative, at least for a pretty large group of people of color, that, you know - you have to recognize that that is part of the story that you're telling.

And to that, would you say, are these people just not willing to be honest about what they're trying to say? GIVHAN: Yeah, I would say that. I mean, I think that if you are making this argument that it is purely a matter of celebrating history, then you have to I believe also recognize the full breadth of that history. And so you can't wear something like a Confederate flag or wave a Confederate flag and say that it only represents this tiny sliver of history when, in fact, there is this really broad history, the bulk of which is pretty negative, at least for a pretty large group of people of color, that, you know - you have to recognize that that is part of the story that you're telling. MARTIN: So tell me a little bit more about what reaction you're getting to the column. GIVHAN: Yeah. I mean, I would say that the reaction is as polarizing as the hat is. The people who agreed with the column are very vocal in expressing that. And then there are people who simply say that, oh, you're reading way too much into the hat, or you, in fact, are a racist because this is what you see in that hat. But I would say that the ones who are perhaps most eloquent in their - the defense of the hat really are the ones who are saying the dark terrible things that you described, do not reflect what's in my heart, do not reflect how I feel about immigrants or how I feel about women, you know? They still feel that the hat is representative of something that goes directly to how they think their government should be run. And, you know, and I say to them that, yes, I understand what your intent is. My argument is that that benign intent has been drowned out, overwhelmed, eradicated by quite a malignant intent. MARTIN: Well, it proves your point, once again, that fashion isn't just fashion. Fashion is communication and culture, right? GIVHAN: Yeah. And it's not simply what you are trying to communicate. It's also - you know, fashion is connected to the broader culture, and all of those outside forces change the meaning of what you wear. MARTIN: That's Washington Post fashion and culture critic Robin Givhan, the Pulitzer Prize-winner joining us in our studios in Washington, D.C. Thank you so much for joining us. GIVHAN: Pleasure.

MARTIN: Is it your contention that this is at a different level, it has some broader cultural meaning apart from the political figure itself? GIVHAN: Yeah. I mean, I do think it's different from those things because - the groups and attitudes and sensibilities and moods that it's associated with. And I think, you know, there is this notion that simply because you put on the hat means that, you know, you are all these terrible things. And I don't necessarily think that is the case. And I don't think most people presume that to be the case. But I do think that there's this sense that if you put on that hat, you are knowingly shrouding yourself in something that has all of these dark connotations and, in knowingly doing that, that implies that you're OK with it. MARTIN: Is that symbolism, in your view, equally understood by those who wear it and by those who receive it or see it? GIVHAN: Sometimes not, sometimes it does. I mean, you know, I think, you know, you can look back in - at much darker periods in history, you know? And there are those who might argue that, oh, I'm wearing this because I'm a history buff. But the broader culture at large knows what it means, historically. MARTIN: Well, you draw the analogy to the Confederate flag. GIVHAN: Right.

It's also - you know, fashion is connected to the broader culture, and all of those outside forces change the meaning of what you wear. MARTIN: That's Washington Post fashion and culture critic Robin Givhan, the Pulitzer Prize-winner joining us in our studios in Washington, D.C. Thank you so much for joining us. GIVHAN: Pleasure.

The authoritative record of NPR's programming is the audio record.\n\nGIVHAN: Sometimes not, sometimes it does. I mean, you know, I think, you know, you can look back in - at much darker periods in history, you know? And there are those who might argue that, oh, I'm wearing this because I'm a history buff. But the broader culture at large knows what it means, historically. MARTIN: Well, you draw the analogy to the Confederate flag. GIVHAN: Right. MARTIN: I mean, you say that - in your column, you say that to wear a MAGA hat is to wrap oneself in a Confederate flag, which you also see as a provocation. Now, along those same lines, there are plenty of people who will say, no, it's not. It's a reflection of history. It's a reflection of Southern heritage. It's not meant to be provocative or racist. And to that, would you say, are these people just not willing to be honest about what they're trying to say? GIVHAN: Yeah, I would say that. I mean, I think that if you are making this argument that it is purely a matter of celebrating history, then you have to I believe also recognize the full breadth of that history. And so you can't wear something like a Confederate flag or wave a Confederate flag and say that it only represents this tiny sliver of history when, in fact, there is this really broad history, the bulk of which is pretty negative, at least for a pretty large group of people of color, that, you know - you have to recognize that that is part of the story that you're telling. MARTIN: So tell me a little bit more about what reaction you're getting to the column. GIVHAN: Yeah. I mean, I would say that the reaction is as polarizing as the hat is. The people who agreed with the column are very vocal in expressing that. And then there are people who simply say that, oh, you're reading way too much into the hat, or you, in fact, are a racist because this is what you see in that hat. But I would say that the ones who are perhaps most eloquent in their - the defense of the hat really are the ones who are saying the dark terrible things that you described, do not reflect what's in my heart, do not reflect how I feel about immigrants or how I feel about women, you know? They still feel that the hat is representative of something that goes directly to how they think their government should be run. And, you know, and I say to them that, yes, I understand what your intent is. My argument is that that benign intent has been drowned out, overwhelmed, eradicated by quite a malignant intent.

They still feel that the hat is representative of something that goes directly to how they think their government should be run. And, you know, and I say to them that, yes, I understand what your intent is. My argument is that that benign intent has been drowned out, overwhelmed, eradicated by quite a malignant intent.

      "text": "6 things Trump says at his rallies and what they really mean\n\nBy\n\nClayton Kincade\n\nFormer President Donald Trump gives the keynote address at Turning Point Action's \"The People's Convention\" on June 15, 2024, in Detroit, Mich. Bill Pugliano/Getty Images hide caption\n\nFormer President Donald Trump loves acronyms, but his catchphrases have become increasingly varied. These new slogans often package massive policy proposals and talking points into a couple of words - and Trump often uses them with little context.\n\nThese sayings offer a glimpse into the former president's goals and priorities this election year.\n\nHere are six of Trump's most common catchphrases and where they come from:\n\nTrump still falsely maintains that Democrats stole the presidential election in 2020 through voter fraud. However, Trump is now promoting mail-in ballots and voter registration, both of which he criticized Democrats for in 2020, in order to make his margins \"Too Big to Rig.\"\n\nTrump lost the 2020 election in margins in the thousands in several crucial swing states, but he believes that Democrats cannot \"rig\" the 2024 election if enough Republicans show up to the ballot box in November. Proven instances of election fraud are rare in U.S. elections.\n\nThe \"Too Big to Rig\" phrase now takes up prime real estate on political signs at Trump's rallies, a reminder to his fiercely loyal supporters of the importance of voting.\n\nA supporter waves a sign in support of Former President Donald Trump at Dream City Church in Phoenix, Ariz., on Thursday, June 6, 2024. Caitlin O'Hara for NPR hide caption\n\nUsed in conjunction with \"Too Big to Rig,\" \"Swamp the Vote\" calls for Trump supporters to vote en masse.\n\nThe initiative, officially titled Swamp the Vote USA, encourages voters to vote absentee, by mail, early in person, or on Election Day.\n\n\"If we swamp them, they can't cheat, it just doesn't work out,\" Trump said in a June 4 video posted to his account on Truth Social, Trump's social media website.\n\n\"Swamp\" is a particularly notorious term for Trump, who ran in 2016 on the campaign promise of \"Draining the Swamp\" of special interests in the federal government. The word in a political context often references the belief that Washington is corrupt with old money, lobbying and term-limit schemes.\n\nTrump did not invent this term, but he has started to revive its relevance in recent months. Former Republican vice presidential candidate and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin popularized \"Drill, Baby, Drill\" on the 2008 campaign trail with her then-running mate, the late Arizona Sen. John McCain, as a way to promote pro-oil drilling and fracking policies.\n\nTrump has started to use the term more frequently in public appearances, but his use dates back to at least 2022. Trump claims that if elected, he will cut energy prices in half, doing so through expanding domestic fracking and oil measures.\n\nHowever, companies set production levels based on market forces, not presidential orders. Efforts to influence production are not guaranteed to succeed: Trump tried and failed to prop up the U.S. coal industry for example.\n\nTrump announced at a June 9 rally that if reelected president, he would attempt to end taxes on tips for those in the service industry. \"Those people that have jobs in restaurants, whatever the job may be, a tipping job, we're not going after for taxes anymore,\" Trump said at the rally.\n\nService workers are required by federal law to report tip earnings on their tax forms, which are then taxed as normal income. Trump would need Congress to act in order to change the practice.\n\nTrump has since made several posts on Truth Social with the moniker.\n\nTrump has faced numerous inquiries, trials and criminal probes, ranging from the Jan. 6 insurrection to hush money to the alleged mishandling of classified documents. In each case, Trump maintains that he is not guilty, but he was recently convicted on 34 felony counts by a jury in his New York hush money trial.\n\nTrump falsely claims that these trials are a \"witch hunt\" by the Biden administration. While the Justice Department oversees the Jan. 6 and classified documents cases, state justice officials handle the others. In the federal cases, the Justice Department maintains its independence from the White House.\n\n\"Never Surrender\" comes from the idea that Trump will not surrender, either in court or metaphorically, to his political adversaries. Trump has vowed to not let these trials drag him down, instead making them a cornerstone of his reelection campaign.\n\nThe phrase occupies an entire themed section on his web store, complete with greyscale T-shirts, mugs and hats, many of which showcase his mugshot from his indictment in the Georgia election case.\n\nA \"never surrender\" Trump poster and an American flag are waved in front of Federal Court on May 30, 2024, in New York. David Dee Delgado/Getty Images hide caption\n\nTrump forever altered the political landscape of the modern Republican party during the 2016 election with the renaissance of the Reagan-era trademark slogan \"Make America Great Again\" (MAGA), which Trump still uses in spades. However, the phrase also includes an important tail-end that has appeared since 2016.\n\nTrump often ends promotional videos and appearances by saying \"Make America Greater than Ever Before.\" \"Again\" marks a return to a past standard, while \"ever before\" implies reaching new heights. With this phrase, Trump wants to convince voters that a second presidential term would usher in a level of social and economic prosperity that America has never seen.\n\nIt is certainly the case that Trump has more material to pull from than \"ever before.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

He'll deliver his main convention speech from the same location on Thursday. Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images hide caption\n\nPresident Trump speaks on the South Lawn of the White House, accompanied by First Lady Melania Trump, on July 4. He'll deliver his main convention speech from the same location on Thursday.\n\nThe last three American presidents all won reelection, and they all knew voters would reward them, not for their accomplishments, but for their future plans.\n\nBill Clinton promised to build a \"bridge to the 21st century\" in 1996. George W. Bush offered safety and prosperity in 2004, built on conservative economic and national security policies. For Barack Obama in 2012, it was all about protecting the middle class as the country continued recovering from the Great Recession.\n\nAt this week's Republican National Convention , President Trump will get a chance to not only remind voters why he thinks Joe Biden would be a disaster in the White House, but also lay out his own vision for the future. So far, he hasn't been very specific about what it is.\n\nLike most incumbents, the president's second-term agenda would be a continuation of his first, and Trump wants to rewind to the moment right before the pandemic began when he says the economy was the best in history.\n\nVice President Mike Pence has doubled down on the back to the future vision as he punctuates speeches with a familiar tagline: \"We are going to make America great again, again.\"\n\nWhen Trump does talk about it, it's always superlative. At a press conference earlier this month, he said , \"If stupid people aren't elected next year, we're going to have one of the greatest years we've ever had.\"\n\n\"It is remarkable how little he has talked about what a second Trump term would look like,\" said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist. \"It's a totally blank slate right now, which is really unusual for anyone running for president, let alone somebody who's been there for four years.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign insists that will change at the convention.\n\n\"The president certainly has a very powerful and forward-looking agenda for the future,\" said Steve Cortes, senior adviser for strategy with the Trump campaign. \"And President Trump believes ... he has the track record to prove that he knows how to create the conditions for a soaring economy, particularly for working-class Americans.\"\n\nThe heart of the agenda, according to Cortes, is economic nationalism - rebuilding prosperity through more deregulation, more tax cuts and more \"America first\" trade deals.\n\nBut Cortes acknowledged that Trump doesn't always focus on those goals.\n\n\"He says a heck of a lot. So sure, at times he's made the case better than other times,\" he said. \"As far as messaging, though, that's incumbent upon me and my colleagues at the campaign to do our job of messaging it to the American people and convincing the president to really stay on message.\"\n\nIt's not every day that a top campaign official admits his candidate is undisciplined, but that's just who Trump is. His economic agenda is mainly a mainstream conservative one, but it gets overshadowed by the rest of his rhetoric, including racist appeals around Confederate monuments, attacks on immigrants and low-income housing and an embrace of wacky conspiracy theories.\n\n\"He is defined in some ways by all of the stylistic critiques that people have of him personally: confrontations, saying whatever's on your mind, tweeting it at all times of the day,\" said Republican strategist Josh Holmes, a former top aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.\n\n\"It's a double-edged sword,\" said Holmes. \"On the one hand, you don't get into the deeper policy issues that I think would have wide appeal across the American electorate. But on the other hand, he talks about whatever it is that he wants to talk about every day.\"\n\nAnd that's for better or for worse, according to Holmes.\n\nMarc Thiessen, a former George W. Bush speechwriter, disagrees and says Trump's core supporters have no trouble understanding what the vision is, and it's exactly what got him elected in 2016.\n\n\"His vision is to finally deliver for the forgotten Americans. The Democrats took them for granted and the Republicans ignored them, and Donald Trump came in and said, 'I'm going to fight for them,' \" Thiessen said. \"They said, 'Yeah, we're hurting in this trade war with China, and we're hurting because of the pandemic. He hasn't brought the jobs back, but he's fighting for us. And I get what he's doing, and we want to reelect him.' So he's got that loyal base because it's the first time they feel that anybody in Washington is speaking for them.\"\n\nThat fierce devotion explains one of the mysteries of this campaign: With more than 175,000 deaths from the coronavirus pandemic and unemployment above 10%, Trump's approval ratings have not collapsed.\n\nStill, Trump's base alone isn't big enough to win the election , and this week is his chance to expand it, according to Conant.\n\n\"What he really needs to do is lay out a compelling agenda for the second term that can bring in people who don't like his tweets, don't like the way he's handled the pandemic, but do like what he's outlining he would do in a second term, especially compared to a more liberal vision coming from Joe Biden,\" he said.\n\nLoading...\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Mario Tama/Getty Images hide caption\n\nFormer President Donald Trump tosses a MAGA hat to the crowd before speaking at a rally in Florence, Ariz., in January.\n\nA little more than a dozen years ago, a new movement erupted in American politics calling itself \"the Tea Party.\" In the midterm elections of 2010, that movement remade Congress and helped the Republican Party to a decade of dominance in electing the legislatures of roughly 30 states.\n\nThe phrase \"Tea Party\" has since faded from the scene. The congressional caucus that went by that name has been largely inactive for years. But the political ferment and fervor once associated with that label have grown more intense as they were reshaped by former President Donald Trump.\n\nToday, the populist energy within the Republican Party goes by the name he gave it: MAGA (Make America Great Again). And its influence on the 2022 midterms seems destined to track that of the Tea Party surge in 2010.\n\nThere is one difference between then and now that could alter that trajectory. The Tea Party was driven largely by hostility to former President Obama. It never had a singular leader of its own whose brand was a driving force in itself - for good or ill. The current MAGA movement is essentially defined by Trump. Its future, short-term and long, will depend largely on his.\n\nGiven all we know about Trump, that sword could be extremely sharp on both edges on Election Day.\n\nThe Tea Party name was both a slogan (Taxed Enough Already) and a feisty reference to the legendary Boston Tea Party of 1773. In grade school we all saw pictures of colonial anti-tax activists tossing tea from a cargo ship in Boston harbor, a prelude to the American Revolution.\n\nThe colonial protesters' Don't Tread on Me flag from that period was often seen among the signs waved by protestors on Washington's National Mall in the spring of 2009. The crowds grew and spread to state capitals and converged on town hall meetings that members of Congress held back home.\n\nDemonstrators gather to protest taxes and economic stimulus spending on Apr. 15, 2009 in Santa Monica, Calif. David McNew/Getty Images hide caption\n\nDemonstrators gather to protest taxes and economic stimulus spending on Apr. 15, 2009 in Santa Monica, Calif.\n\nAt the outset, they were primarily protesting the tax and spending plans of the new administration under President Barack Obama. But signs at rallies also targeted gun control and abortion, and some depicted Obama with a slice of watermelon for a mouth. Soon enough, the movement found its focus in the health care reforms known as Obamacare.\n\nSome in the Tea Party movement also cast doubt on Obama's legitimacy as president, insisting he had been born in Africa. Although that particular theory was thoroughly disproven, it retained its appeal and its power to rouse rowdy crowds. It also merged well with the issue of Obamacare, and the combination formed the basis for the emerging candidacy of Trump, who would also add the promise of a wall across the entire U.S.-Mexican border.\n\nTrump had been known as a high-stakes, high-risk Manhattan businessman and flamboyant media personality. He had been a Democrat before flirting with a third-party presidential bid in 2000. Then he turned up at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February 2011.\n\nThe Tea Party movement was then nearing its second birthday and riding high. The Tea Party Caucus had formed in Congress with 52 members the previous summer, reflecting the popularity of the label in the wake of the 2010 midterms. In those critical elections, robust Republican turnout (and lackluster Democratic turnout) helped the party capture more than 60 seats in the U.S. House - the most the GOP had flipped in one election since 1938.\n\nRepublicans also captured six governorships (for a total of 29) and increased the number of state legislative chambers they controlled from 36 to 60. Obama called it \"a shellacking.\"\n\nBut the 2010 beatdown had one missing piece. While Republicans romped in many Senate races that year - winning 24 of the 37 on the ballot and gaining 6 seats - they fell short of winning a majority in that chamber. While Tea Party turnout helped the party outpoll Democrats for the Senate by 2 million votes nationally, it wasn't quite enough.\n\nIn 2012, with Obama winning a second term as president, Republicans held their majority in the House but again struggled in the Senate races. Democrats won 23 of the 31 Senate seats on that year's ballot, including two in particular the GOP had counted on winning.\n\nOne was the Indiana seat of longtime incumbent Republican Richard Lugar. Lugar was shocked by a Tea Party challenger, Richard Mourdock, who got 60% in the primary. But in a debate that fall, Mourdock defended his opposition to abortion even in cases of rape by saying such a pregnancy was still \"something God intended.\" He lost to a Democrat that fall.\n\nAnother seat Republicans had expected to win was in Missouri, where incumbent Claire McCaskill was considered the most vulnerable Democratic senator of the cycle. The crowded Republican primary was won by Todd Akin, a member of the Tea Party Caucus in Congress, who in a debate with McCaskill said this about a pregnancy following a rape : \"If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to shut that whole thing down.\" McCaskill wound up winning reelection easily.\n\nIn the 2014 cycle, Obama was no longer on the ballot to juice Democratic turnout. But he was still in office, and that spurred Republican turnout. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell saw his opportunity to end eight years of minority status and put a heavy thumb on the scale in that year's Republican primaries. His direction of party resources to the mainstream nominees he preferred put him at odds with Tea Party enthusiasts in several contests.\n\nMilitary veterans, Tea Party activists and Republicans gather in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 13, 2013 to rally for the reopening of national memorials and against then-President Barack Obama during a government shutdown.

(Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images)\n\nMcConnell's picks won, and in the fall they beat the Democrats in two thirds of the races, gaining nine seats and installing McConnell as majority leader. As majority leader, he blocked one Supreme Court nominee (by Obama in 2016) and oversaw the confirmation of three nominated by Trump.\n\nTrump was never a conventional Republican, as McConnell would be the first to say. Trump did not try to claim the mantle of previous Republican presidents. He did not woo the Republicans' party elites or major donors. He had no previous government experience and regarded that as an asset. He never really claimed the Tea Party label, but as he became increasingly visible as a candidate during Obama's second term, he co-opted much of the Tea Party agenda and schedule of grievances.\n\nHe also borrowed a slogan from Ronald Reagan's presidential campaigns (\"Let's Make America Great Again\") trimming the first word for brevity and punch. The four-letter acronym was soon emblazoned on a million campaign hats and regularly added to Trump's messages on Twitter. His followers embraced it.\n\nTrump has now been out of office for 16 months, but MAGA marches on. Like the Tea Party rising in the first two years of Obama's presidency, MAGA has thrived as Democratic President Joe Biden has struggled. Inflation is at a 40-year high, and the country is in a restive mood.\n\nBiden has fallen 16 percentage points in the Gallup measure of presidential approval, just as Obama had fallen by about 20 at a comparable point in 2010 ( Obama had started at 67% approval, Biden at 57% ).\n\nThroughout that year, the Tea Party positioned itself to spearhead the new majority GOP in the next Congress. MAGA is doing much the same now. But just as the Tea Party then was a force in House races that sometimes misfired on the statewide stage, MAGA is likely to be tested in 2022 and beyond.\n\nCandidates who had Trump's endorsement have won important primaries for the Senate in swing states such as Ohio and North Carolina. The former was especially notable, as many of the state's establishment Republicans had stuck with one of their own, Josh Mandel, while Trump jumped in for the right-wing firebrand J.D. Vance .\n\nIn North Carolina, where former governor Pat McCrory was running for the GOP Senate nod, the primary winner is Trump-backed and lesser-known Rep. Ted Budd , who has refused to say whether Biden is the legitimate president.\n\nPennsylvania's primary showed both the power of Trump's endorsement and its potential unintended consequences. For the Senate, Trump strongly endorsed the celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz, snubbing a hedge fund billionaire who had served in the George W. Bush administration. That race appears to be headed for a statewide recount .\n\nEven more eye-catching was Trump's choice in the Pennsylvania governor's race. Former Rep. Lou Barletta, a loyal Trump supporter, was in the hunt, but Trump opted for Doug Mastriano, a retired colonel and state legislator who was actively involved in trying to overturn Biden's win in the state last fall.\n\nMastriano was in the angry crowd outside the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, when rioters entered the House and Senate chambers attempting to overturn the election. He has been subpoenaed by the House committee investigating that attack.\n\nHe has also been an outspoken foe of all abortions. The memory of what happened to Mourdock and Akin, caught out on the issue of abortion, is especially meaningful at this moment.\n\nTotal bans are now the legislative agenda in some states, and could be part of the GOP's congressional agenda next year if they are in charge and the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade as expected this summer.\n\nThe issue of abortion access might help Democrats address their perennial problem with turnout in midterm elections. The same might be true of Trump's sure-to-be-visible role in many campaigns this fall.\n\nTrump offers a backstop for Republicans in some races, but he also poses a risk. Most Republicans want the 2022 elections to be about inflation and federal mandates. Trump's role risks making them instead a referendum on him and his baseless insistence he won an election he lost.\n\nHow the Trump factor will play out may vary from state to state. But we can expect him to be, as ever, a magnet for media attention. He will instantly nationalize contests on which he concentrates. He will summon the us-versus-them reflex in voters across the political spectrum.\n\nPerhaps the mere presence of Trump in the fall will be enough to bolster weaker GOP nominees and even save the Mourdocks and Akins of 2022. But there remains the possibility that the Jan. 6th investigation or developments elsewhere will make Trump more of an albatross for his party. It would indeed be an irony if he ultimately saved Biden from a shellacking of his own.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "Donald Trump's Been Saying The Same Thing For 30 Years\n\nBy\n\nDon Gonyea\n\n,\n\nDomenico Montanaro\n\nDonald Trump interviewed on Larry King Live on Oct, 7, 1999. Trump said he had formed an exploratory committee to help him determine whether he could win the White House as a Reform Party candidate. Marty Lederhandler/AP hide caption\n\nDonald Trump interviewed on Larry King Live on Oct, 7, 1999. Trump said he had formed an exploratory committee to help him determine whether he could win the White House as a Reform Party candidate.\n\nFor decades, Donald Trump both toyed with and coyly denied any interest in pursuing the presidency - until his expectation-shattering campaign of the 2016 election.\n\nBut if you go back and watch old clips - and by old, we mean decades-old - you hear a young Donald Trump sounding very much like the current Trump. Common themes include his view that trade wasn't fair, that the world has long laughed at America and countries have taken advantage of U.S. generosity while refusing to pay their \"fair share\" for all the U.S. does globally.\n\nTrump does something else in these interviews. Talking to Playboy magazine in 1990, for example, he accurately predicts where his strongest support would come from should he ever decide to run for office - the working class.\n\nHere's journalist Glenn Plaskin, who wrote the Playboy story, recalling what Trump said when asked who would support him for the White House: \"When I walk down the street, those cabbies start yelling out their window. ... The working guy would elect me; they like me.\"\n\nHere are six clips of Trump from the 1980s and '90s that make the point:\n\n1. 1987, CNN's Larry King:\n\nA 41-year-old Donald Trump said of leadership and trade:\n\n\"I was tired, and I think a lot of other people are tired of watching other people ripping off the United States. This is a great country. They laugh at us. Behind our backs, they laugh at us because of our own stupidity. Our leaders - what we have, we have a Persian Gulf situation today. ... Billions and billions are paid getting oil for Japan, and they are paying nothing for it, essentially they're paying nothing for it.\"\n\nMore:\n\n\"I believe it's very important that you have free trade, but we don't have free trade right now.\"\n\nAnd Trump even leveled a cryptic allegation against former New York Mayor Ed Koch:\n\n\"I think, probably, over the next period of time, something's going to come out where he will not be the mayor of the city of New York hopefully much longer.\"\n\nThe New York Times noted in Koch's obituary in 2013 that he \"was a bachelor who lived for politics. Perhaps inevitably there were rumors, some promoted by his enemies, that he was gay. But no proof was offered, and, except for two affirmations in radio interviews that he was heterosexual, he responded to the rumors with silence or a rebuke. 'Whether I am straight or gay or bisexual is nobody's business but mine,' he wrote in 'Citizen Koch,' his 1992 autobiography.\"\n\nTrump told King that he accepted an invitation to appear in New Hampshire, understanding full well what that would imply to his potential desire to run for president.\n\n2. 1988, Oprah:\n\nBack then, Trump was critical of Japan, and this criticism echoes the way he talks today about NATO. He told Oprah Winfrey:\n\n\"I'd make our allies pay their fair share.\"\n\nHe took a hard line with the Middle East, saying:\n\n\"Kuwait, they live like kings. The poorest person in Kuwait, they live like kings. And yet they're not paying. We make it possible for them to sell their oil. Why aren't they paying us 25 percent of what they're making? It's a joke.\"\n\nAsked if he'd run for president, Trump said:\n\n\"I just probably wouldn't do it, Oprah. I probably wouldn't, but I do get tired of seeing what's happening with this country, and if it got so bad, I would never want to rule it out totally, because I really am tired of seeing what's happening with this country, how we're really making other people live like kings, and we're not.\"\n\nMore about a presidential run and winning. He even uses his signature \"believe me:\"\n\n\"I think I'd win. I tell you what, I wouldn't go in to lose. I've never gone in to lose in my life. And if I did decide to do it, I think I would be inclined - I would say, I would have a hell of a chance of winning, because I think people - I don't know how your audience feels, but I think people are tired of seeing the United States ripped off. And I can't promise you everything, but I can tell you one thing, this country would make one hell of a lot of money from those people that for 25 years have taken advantage. It wouldn't be the way it's been, believe me.\"\n\n3. 1988, Letterman :\n\nHere he spoke to Letterman just after the presidential election. He said he thought Bush would win and thinks he'll do a good job. But he again used Japan as his punching bag in talking about trade deficits and made the U.S. ally into an economic boogeyman:\n\n\"We are living in very precarious times. If you look at what certain countries are doing to this country, such as Japan. I mean, they've totally taken advantage of the country. ... I'm talking about the [trade] deficits. They come and they talk about free trade. They dump the cars and the VCRs and everything else. We defend Japan for virtually nothing, which is hard to believe. So when I see all that I get very nervous, but I think George Bush is going to do a great job, and he's going to straighten - hopefully - he'll straighten it out.\"\n\nLetterman then wondered aloud whether there was \"any way a guy like you could go broke.\" The crowd gave a huge laugh, and Trump said he would like to think he could weather any storm. But little did he - or Letterman - know that just three years later , Trump would file his first of four bankruptcies over two decades. That was for his hotel and casino in Atlantic City, N.J., the Taj Mahal, which Trump touted on the show as a project he was building that he believed would be a \"tremendous success.\"\n\nTrump continued to flirt with the idea of running for president down the road, despite denying he would. Trump seems to preview a version of what would eventually become his 2016 \"Make America Great Again\" campaign slogan.\n\n\"I'm not sure you want to see the United States become a winner. Do you want to see the United States become a winner, David?\"\n\nLetterman shot back:\n\n\"The United States is and always has been a winner for my money, Don.\"\n\n4. 1990, Playboy magazine: Take a look at this March 1990 Playboy interview. Lots of politics in here, including Trump's response to a question about how he'd handle an international crisis, perhaps involving nuclear weapons:\n\n\"And how would President Trump handle it? \"He would believe very strongly in extreme military strength. He wouldn't trust anyone. He wouldn't trust the Russians; he wouldn't trust our allies; he'd have a huge military arsenal, perfect it, understand it. Part of the problem is that we're defending some of the wealthiest countries in the world for nothing. ... We're being laughed at around the world.\"\n\nIn many of these clips, the \"Vintage Trump\" is the \"Current Trump.\"\n\nHe's a future candidate floating a future campaign slogan - and maybe an inaugural address.\n\n5. 1999, Larry King:\n\nAs he came to do during the 2016 campaign, Trump touted the polls. But he also echoed the dichotomy of Trump - a frustration with some in the media, but also the understanding that he needs them; he used King's show to break news.\n\nFirst, the frustration:\n\n\"All that's happening now is people are coming out with polls. It was sort of interesting, the one sort of negative poll I had was on Newsweek , and they put me on the cover, so I said, how could you write a poll, how could you do a poll like this, and I'm on the cover of Newsweek ? And, you know, it was just one of those things. But the polls have been unbelievable.\"\n\nBut then right after that...\n\n\"So I am going to form a presidential exploratory committee, I might as well announce that on your show, everyone else does. But I'll be forming that, effective, I believe, tomorrow, and we'll see. We're going to take a very good, strong look at it.\"\n\nAnd there was the trademark bombast:\n\n\"I have a lot to lose, Larry. I'm the biggest developer in New York, by far. I'm doing more, as you know from being here, a lot. I'm doing more than any - I'm building 90-story buildings all over the place, and we're just doing a lot, and we're doing great. The city's the hottest city, and I'm the hottest developer in the hottest city in the world right now.\"\n\nBut also the foundation of an outsider message, critical of politicians:\n\n\"Other guys, you know, they run. Pat Buchanan, what is he --, you know, he's not giving up anything. What's he doing? And, politicians when they run, they run from one office to another; it's the same thing, they answer different calls. I'm giving up a lot if I decide to run.\"\n\nBuchanan was running for the Reform Party nomination - the same one Ross Perot had in 1992 and 1996. Trump, master of the insult, showed his ability to go for the low blow against a potential opponent:\n\n\"I believe I can get the Reform Party nomination. I don't even think it would be that tough, it's going to be Buchanan. And I think he just blew himself up with the book, and his love affair with Adolf Hitler.\"\n\nTrump said the priority for his exploratory committee was to take a hard look at whether he could actually win the presidency as the Reform Party candidate, not just compete. He never climbed out of single digits in head-to-heads against George W. Bush and Al Gore, and Trump eventually dropped his bid.\n\nTrump also spelled out some of his philosophy with King. He said that, even though he's a Republican, he's pretty \"liberal\" on social issues, notably health care. He said he believes, in fact, in \"universal health care\" and agreed that it was an \"entitlement from birth.\"\n\n\"I'm quite liberal, and getting much more liberal, on health care and other things. I really say, what's the purpose of a country if you're not going to have defense and health care. If you can't take care of your sick in the country, forget it. It's all over. I mean, it's no good. So I'm very liberal when it comes to health care. I believe in universal health care. I believe in whatever it takes to make people well and better.\"\n\nRemember when Trump told the Washington Post recently that his goal was \"insurance for everybody?\" It's something other Republicans have been trying to walk back - and Trump remains a wild card.\n\nTrump also had lots of criticism for both parties:\n\n\"I think that nobody's really hitting it right. The Democrats are too far left. ... The Republicans are too far right. I don't think anybody's hitting the chord. Not the chord that I want to hear and not the chord that other people want to hear.\"\n\nTrump talked about Ronald Reagan as a president who had a certain \"style and class,\" which he called a \"really big part of being president.\" But he also hinted at when he thought the country was great - under Eisenhower in the 1950s, which happens to be when he was a child:\n\n\"Eisenhower, I don't see him too much on lists of great, great presidents, but it was a nice time in the country. The country had a prestige, and he had a certain, you know, demeanor. He was a quality, class act. There are certain people who have that.\"\n\nTrump also knocked NAFTA and U.S. trade policies:\n\n\"I'm not an isolationist. What I am, though, is - I think that you have to be treated fairly by other countries. If other countries aren't going to treat you fairly, Larry, I think that those countries should be --, they should suffer the consequences.\"\n\nTrump argued:\n\n\"We could reduce taxes and take care of health care, and it would be beautiful, and you'd have plenty of money left over.\"\n\nHe hinted at his potential constituency later on - \"workers:\"\n\n\"The workers are the ones that really like me. I've often said, the rich people hate me, and the workers love me. Now, the rich people that know me, like me, but the rich people that don't know me, they truly dislike me.\"\n\nTrump also said he believes in one term as president:\n\n\"I do like the concept of one term, I want to run one term, and I want to do the right job - straighten out Social Security, get the trade deficits in order and lower taxes.\"\n\nHe has not made that pledge during this campaign.\n\nHarking back to that 1988 Oprah Winfrey interview, Trump told King that \"Oprah would be my first choice\" for vice president.\n\nNot quite Mike Pence, so ... some things change.\n\n6. 1999, Trump on NBC's Meet the Press with Tim Russert:\n\nTrump echoed some of the same sentiments from his appearance on Larry King, said he was serious about running. But he also addressed dating various women, that his second wife, Marla Maples, came out against him running. And Trump defended his past statements about women and his companies' bankruptcies.\n\nHe also saber-rattled on North Korea, seeming to advocate for preemptive action. Trump said the most important issue facing the country was controlling the \"nuclear problem,\" otherwise the economy won't matter so much.\n\nAnd Trump struck a familiar tone on immigration:\n\n\"Too many people are flowing into the country,\" he said, \"and we have to take care of our own first.\"\n\nBut Trump has clearly changed on some issues, notably abortion. Back then, he said he was \"very pro-choice.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images hide caption\n\nDonald Trump has made hats embroidered with the phrase \"Make America Great Again\" - an icon of his campaign and frequent giveaway item during his rallies.\n\nDonald Trump has run his presidential campaign by his own rules, and he's blown past traditional candidates, playing by the old rules, in the process.\n\nWhen it comes to building a campaign, Trump is investing in the kinds of traditional infrastructure that are important to turning out voters. He's also investing heavily in something that has been key to his success in business - branding.\n\nSpending patterns from the last quarter on swag (hats, T-shirts, buttons, etc.) and events (venues, sound, lighting, etc.). This does not include spending by superPACs that support specific candidates. Source: Federal Election Commission hide caption\n\nThat was at play during a recent campaign rally in Jacksonville, Fla. Like all candidates, Trump tried to connect with the audience. No one else would try it the way Trump did last weekend.\n\nAfter wild cheering, and his exclamation, \"What a group of people!\" he told this anecdote: \"I had a casino boat built here. It did great. We sold it. Made a lotta money. So I love Jacksonville.\"\n\nPoliticians don't usually brag about making money, but Trump isn't running the usual political campaign. He's doing branding, and the brand is Donald Trump.\n\nBrad Van Auken, a branding strategy consultant in Rochester, N.Y., said in an interview that Trump's message is to reinforce his image.\n\nVan Auken described that image: \"You know it's successful, it's risk-taking but it's combative. He's not afraid to offend. He is a fighter. He's entertaining. He's confident.\"\n\nConsultants can use a branding checklist, Van Auken said. \"It actually measures the five drivers of customers' insisting on the brand, and the No. 1 driver is awareness.\"\n\nAnd by now, Trump's name recognition is sky high. He has been a celebrity since the 1980s, doing real estate deals, casinos, marriages and reality TV shows. Trump claims his brand as a sizable chunk of his net worth.\n\n\"If you've heard the saying that any kind of publicity is good publicity, that's largely true,\" Van Auken said.\n\nVan Auken said the No. 2 driver of brand insistence is \"relevant differentiation\" - the differences audiences perceive between brands and how much those differences matter.\n\nJeb Bush's campaign spent 1/1,000th of the money Donald Trump spent on campaign swag in the third quarter of 2015. Charles Krupa/AP hide caption\n\nJeb Bush's campaign spent 1/1,000th of the money Donald Trump spent on campaign swag in the third quarter of 2015.\n\nTrump's \"relevant differentiation\" from other candidates can be teased out of the campaign's spending reports. He doesn't spend - doesn't need to spend, he says - on media consultants, TV ads or pollsters.\n\nThe Trump campaign declined requests for comment for this story.\n\nIt spends plenty of cash for events starring Donald Trump. In the third quarter, it reported outlays exceeding $356,000 for venues and event production. Another $10,000 went for \"event staging consulting.\"\n\nAt those events, Trump doesn't talk like a politician.\n\n\"You're gonna have so many wins, they're gonna be pouring out of your ears,\" he told a crowd Monday in Atkinson, N.H. \"You're gonna get tired of winning. You're gonna say, Mr. President, let's have a loss. This is getting boring. And I'm gonna say, no, I won't do that.\"\n\nMeredith Post, a brand strategist in Cincinnati, told NPR that Trump is a disrupter in the presidential politics market. Asked to name a disrupter in commercial markets, she said, \"There's a lot of disruptive brands out there. One that comes to mind is Axe\" - a Unilever company that sells grooming products to guys from their tweens to early 20s.\n\nLike Trump, Axe specializes in going where others won't. In an ad for a hair product, two teenage girls talk excitedly: \"Smell my finger.\" \"Who is that?\" It's Greg.\" At which point, the self-assured Greg walks by, his hair slightly mussed.\n\nDisruptive brands \"have an irreverent tone of voice that goes back to what they promise, what the experience will be like. And something that is unapologetic,\" Post said.\n\nShe cited Trump's trademarked slogan, \"Make America Great Again.\"\n\n\"Just because the fact he added on the 'again' on at the end, it spins it to act like America hasn't been great. And he's going to bring us back,\" Post said.\n\nIn the third quarter, Trump's campaign spent more than $912,000 on hats, T-shirts, banners, yard signs and decals emblazoned with Make America Great Again.\n\nHe often tosses the hats out to the crowd at rallies, but Trump's website also sells them at $20 to $30 apiece. Those purchases count as campaign contributions.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Nic Antaya/Getty Images hide caption\n\nFormer President Donald Trump speaks during a rally on May 1 at Avflight Saginaw in Freeland, Mich.\n\nIn 2024, a Donald Trump campaign speech is many things: a forum to air grievances against his opponents and ongoing criminal proceedings, a safe space to test his popularity among supporters and a lengthy stream of consciousness responding to political news of the day.\n\nA Trump speech also gives insight on how he would govern in a second term if he wins the election this November.\n\nThe former president's campaign events are surreal to experience: all-day affairs that are equal parts religious revival and massive pep rallies, powered by an infamous musical playlist that runs for hours before he speaks.\n\nIt's an eclectic mix of songs that reflects Trump's personal tastes, ranging from Elton John's \"Tiny Dancer\" to music from Phantom of the Opera to Village People's \"Y.M.C.A.,\" culminating with Lee Greenwood's country classic \"God Bless The U.S.A.\" as he walks on stage to thunderous applause.\n\nIt's also helpful to think of what Trump says at these events as its own curated playlist: never the same topics in the same order, heavy on the greatest hits but with plenty of space left for new tracks that riff on what's popular.\n\nPlenty of Trump's speech is tied to where he is, who he's talking to and how it fits in the political moment.\n\nPicture this: it's the night before the first presidential primary contest, so Trump's remarks in Indianola, Iowa, feature diss tracks against top rivals Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis, plus crowd pleasing mentions of tariffs and increased access to ethanol, both topics important to Iowa's farmers.\n\nBut there's also plenty of typical Trumpian fare that could've been delivered anywhere:\n\n\"These caucuses are your personal chance to score the ultimate victory over all of the liars, cheaters, thugs, perverts, frauds, crooks, freaks, creeps, and other quite nice people,\" Trump said.\n\nIt can be hard for even seasoned observers to track what's new or notable in his speeches. The run time is often more than an hour and can switch tone and topics at random.\n\nDonald Trump's campaign speeches feature familiar attacks against opponents like Joe Biden, plus one off riffs on his policy proposals. Scott Olson/Getty Images hide caption\n\nDonald Trump's campaign speeches feature familiar attacks against opponents like Joe Biden, plus one off riffs on his policy proposals.\n\nStill, there are common threads, including attacks against the array of criminal charges against him, as prosecutors allege everything from election interference to business fraud to mishandling classified documents.\n\nFor example, in 15 major speeches reviewed by NPR from this year, Trump says his indictments far outpace the reputation of a notorious gangster: Al Capone - or, as Trump affectionately refers to him, \"Alphonse.\"\n\n\"This was the roughest, meanest gangster in history,\" Trump said at the Black Conservative Federation's gala in Columbia, S.C., earlier this year. \"I've been indicted more than Alphonse Capone, Scarface. If he had dinner with you, and if he didn't like the tone of your voice, he would kill you that night. You would never see your family again. You were dead.\"\n\nAt that February event, Trump also mused that his indictments help him appeal to Black voters.\n\nThe tone and tenor of Trump's campaign speeches have taken a darker turn in 2024, like in Dayton, Ohio, where he warned of a \"bloodbath\" for the auto industry if he loses the election. Scott Olson/Getty Images hide caption\n\nThe tone and tenor of Trump's campaign speeches have taken a darker turn in 2024, like in Dayton, Ohio, where he warned of a \"bloodbath\" for the auto industry if he loses the election.\n\nTrump's 2024 campaign speeches have many commonalities - like verses that mock President Joe Biden's age, appearance, activities and actions as president.\n\n\"I mean the guy can't put two sentences together, he can't find the stairs to a platform,\" Trump said in Richmond, Va.\n\nThere's also unique riffs that raise eyebrows and make headlines, like the time in Conway, S.C., where Trump said he wouldn't defend some NATO allies against Russia .\n\n\"If we don't pay and we're attacked by Russia, will you protect us?\" Trump said another NATO leader asked him one time. \"'No, I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want.'\"\n\nThen, in Dayton, Ohio, Trump warned his defeat could be terrible for the automotive industry.\n\n\"If I don't get elected, it's going to be a bloodbath for the whole ... that's going to be the least of it,\" Trump said. \"It's going to be a bloodbath for the country. That'll be the least of it.\"\n\nAs the year has progressed, Trump's rallies have taken a darker, more defiant tone, and his \"greatest hits\" are increasingly hitting back at groups that he feels have wronged him, or aren't on board with the \"Make America Great Again\" vision.\n\nIn North Carolina and Virginia, Pennsylvania and Nevada to hear Trump tell it, there will be no America unless he is in charge and Biden is vanquished.\n\n\"He's a demented tyrant who is trying to destroy our democracy,\" Trump said of the president in Schnecksville, Pa.\n\nIn Las Vegas, Trump told a roaring crowd to think of the 10 worst presidents in American history.\n\n\"They would not have done near the destruction to our country as Crooked Joe Biden and the Biden administration have done,\" he said.\n\n\"He's destroying our country,\" Trump said, echoing his remarks in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe hostile phrasing around the promise to implement hardline policies like mass deportations - and expanding the powers of the presidency to punish opponents - is a feature, not a bug, of Trump's campaign message.\n\nIt's a message that says the stakes are too high to ignore.\n\n\"We will fight for America like no one has ever fought before,\" he intoned in Greensboro, N.C., as an instrumental with ties to the QAnon movement played underneath. \"2024 is our final battle.\"\n\nWhile no two rallies are exactly the same, the final notes of a Trump speech are like a catchy political earworm as he vows to make America powerful, wealthy, strong, proud and safe once more, ending with his signature promise to \"Make America great again.\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump and attorney Susan Necheles attend his trial at the Manhattan Criminal court, Tuesday. Less than a week after a pair of campaign rallies, Trump is mandated to be back in court almost everyday, making the Manhattan courtroom his campaign trail stop of necessity. Win MacNamee/AP hide caption\n\nFormer President Donald Trump and attorney Susan Necheles attend his trial at the Manhattan Criminal court, Tuesday. Less than a week after a pair of campaign rallies, Trump is mandated to be back in court almost everyday, making the Manhattan courtroom his campaign trail stop of necessity.\n\nTrump's last two rallies last week were held on the only day of the week his New York trial was not in session. But, in his first stop, he largely avoided talking about that trial that has kept him off the campaign trail .\n\nIn front of his biggest fans once again, Trump's verbal playlist in Waukesha, Wis., featured comedic asides, like telling a protester to \"Go home to mom!\"\n\nBetween his usual comments about closing the southern border, deporting migrants and claiming global conflict would cease if he was in charge, Trump made inflammatory remarks about Palestinian refugees that garnered little media attention .\n\n\"Under no circumstances shall we bring thousands of refugees from Hamas-controlled terrorist epicenters like Gaza to America,\" he said.\n\nTrump reiterated support for a travel ban from Muslim-majority countries, and implied an influx of migrants to the U.S. would lead to a terrorist attack similar to the Oct. 7 attack in Israel.\n\n\"We do not need a jihad in the United States of America,\" he added to cheers from the crowd.\n\nA few hours later, Trump curated a different vibe in Freeland, Mich., making no mention of Gaza. He did, however, give significant airtime to his criminal proceedings and how much they cramped his campaign style.\n\n\"As you know, I have come here today from New York City where I'm being forced to sit for days on end in a kangaroo courtroom with a corrupt and conflicted judge enduring a Biden sideshow trial,\" he said.\n\nAnd because it's the Trump show, that applause line was soon followed by a familiar refrain.\n\n\"Has anyone ever heard of Al Capone? Scarface!\" he quipped.\n\nUntil the New York hush money trial has wrapped, Trump's main act will be headlining the inside (and outside) of a Manhattan courtroom.\n\nHe'll take his show on the road again Saturday in New Jersey, where you can expect familiar tunes, both verbal and musical, like the Sam and Dave song \"Hold On, I'm Comin'\" that typically ends his rallies.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "As Harris inches ahead, the cavalry comes to Trump's aid on the airwaves\n\nDomenico Montanaro\n\nAllies of former President Donald Trump stepped up their ad spending after Vice President Harris entered the race for president. Rebecca Noble/Getty Images hide caption\n\nWith polls showing former President Donald Trump slipping behind Vice President Harris in multiple states, Trump's allies are stepping on the gas to try to make up ground, according to a new NPR analysis of ad data provided in partnership with the ad-tracking firm AdImpact.\n\nTrump's campaign and outside groups supporting him - call them Team Trump - are now outspending Team Harris in four of the seven swing states. That represents a sharp turnaround from earlier in the campaign when President Biden was dominating the airwaves.\n\nTrump's campaign has said a spending surge was always in the plans for around the time of both political conventions. But the increase includes states like North Carolina that previously leaned in Trump's direction. Trump's allies spent little there before Harris entered the race. New investments there show how things have moved.\n\nPennsylvania is, by far, the state with the most significant ad spending in the past month, with almost $100 million in total. That figure is 54% more than the next closest state, Michigan.\n\nAll included, however, when considering national advertising and nonstate-specific digital advertising, Team Harris has outspent Team Trump in the past month by more than $50 million - $246.3 million to $192 million.\n\nThat's largely because of Harris' spending during the Olympics as well as her domination online. On digital, Team Harris has spent about $72 million compared with Trump's $16 million. Younger voters take in more of their information online, and they certainly represent a critical piece of Harris' potential base.\n\nLoading...\n\nOverall, so far since the beginning of this presidential cycle, more than $1.6 billion has either been spent on ads that have already run or been booked through Election Day. Democrats have spent $882 million to Republicans' $721 million.\n\nAbout $1.2 billion has been spent on ads that have run already, with the parties about evenly divided.\n\nViews were not solidified about Harris when she entered the race. So it's perhaps not surprising then that the most run ads have all been about trying to define who she is.\n\nIn total, the top five most aired ads in the past month have been all about Harris and add up to nearly $100 million.\n\nDemocrats are putting forward gauzy ads focused on her biography.\n\nThe ad that has aired the most - more than 45,000 times - is from Harris' campaign and is heavy on her background. It echoes her convention speech, portraying her as growing up working class, saying she was raised by her mom and pointing out that she worked at McDonald's. It then pivots to health care and housing costs while criticizing Trump for his tax cuts that it says skewed toward benefiting the wealthy.\n\nThe ad with the most money behind it - $25 million - is an anti-Harris ad from a super PAC supporting Trump, Make America Great Again Inc. It attacks her on her record on handling immigrants in the U.S. illegally, during her time as a prosecutor.\n\nBut a charge in the ad, while it has a kernel of truth, is misleading . Her office convicted Edwin Ramos, a member of the MS-13 gang, for the murder of a father and two sons. Ramos is now serving three consecutive life sentences. Following through on a campaign promise, Harris did not seek the death penalty, a decision that conservatives have criticized .\n\nThe ad also alleges that Harris \"let\" Ramos \"go\" on another crime before he committed the murders. The facts on this are complicated. Ramos had been pulled over for illegally tinted windows and no front license plate. The passenger in the car, Erik Lopez, got out and ran. Police saw Lopez toss a gun into a gutter. Both men were arrested. But Harris did not bring charges against Ramos because, as the San Francisco Chronicle reported per Harris' office, \"there was no evidence that Ramos had known that Lopez had a gun.\"\n\nDespite his immigration status, Ramos was not turned over to federal authorities because of San Francisco's policy of being a \"sanctuary city.\" But at the time, Harris opposed the city's policy of not turning juveniles in the country illegally over to federal authorities. Ironically, she had to contend with criticism from the left on this in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "Elon Musk has given $75 million, so far, to put Donald Trump back in the White House\n\nBy\n\nEric McDaniel\n\nTesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk listens as Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event in Butler, Pa., on Oct. 5. Alex Brandon/AP hide caption\n\nElon Musk is now a Republican mega-donor.\n\nMusk, estimated to be the world's richest person, was the sole donor to the political action committee he created, America PAC, a group that spent about $72 million to support Donald Trump's reelection bid between July and September, according to a new quarterly filing with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nMusk's $75 million in giving was among several big fundraising hauls disclosed Tuesday in filings with the FEC. The filings show Musk joined other prominent Silicon Valley figures in supporting Trump, including the venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, who each donated $2.5 million to a super PAC aligned with the former president. (Horowitz has since said that he will make a \" significant donation \" to support Harris.)\n\nSince its launch in May, Musk's super PAC has quickly emerged as a key piece of the effort to return Trump to the White House, working to turn out the vote in key swing states. Musk endorsed Trump in July following the failed assassination attempt against the former president, and has gone on to become a vocal supporter. Earlier this month, the billionaire head of Tesla and SpaceX even appeared on stage with Trump when he returned to the site of the assassination attempt.\n\nOutside of Silicon Valley, Miriam Adelson, a long-time power-player in Republican politics alongside her late husband, casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, has funded her Preserve America super PAC to the tune of $100 million so far this year.\n\nRailroad heir Timothy Mellon is this cycle's largest individual donor. He contributed $125 million to the Make America Great Again super PAC earlier this year.\n\nDespite the glut of money in the outside Republican groups, the groups most closely connected to Trump's campaign have failed to match Vice President Harris' fundraising numbers. Trump 47, which faces fewer rules than super PACs and shoulders a great deal of his campaign expenses , raised $145 million this summer.\n\nVice President Harris' comparable joint fundraising group, the Harris Victory Fund, raised $633 million during the same time period.\n\nHer allied super PAC, known as Future Forward, has raised $175 million this calendar year, which includes time when President Biden was on the ticket.\n\nThe group's largest individual supporters are Mike Bloomberg, who has contributed $19 million, and LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman, who gave $10 million.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "The Government Donald Trump Left Behind\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nDonald Trump was elected president in 2016 following a campaign of pledges to build a wall along the border with Mexico, repeal and replace his predecessor's signature health care legislation, \"drain the swamp\" of special interests in Washington, D.C., and cut through the federal government's bureaucracy, all to \"Make America Great Again.\"\n\nTrump ultimately fell short on many of his signature promises, but his administration's successes in cutting taxes, rolling back regulations and reshaping the judiciary will cast a long shadow, with the national debt reaching historic highs, weakened federal agencies and conservative judges who will remain in position for decades.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has begun undoing some inherited policies via executive orders, yet much of what the new administration ultimately hopes to achieve cannot be accomplished by presidential fiat. Like Trump when he was reversing Obama-era regulations, Biden will need cooperation from Congress, including compromises with at least some Republicans in the Senate, to enact significant swaths of his agenda, and he faces a ticking clock to undo some of Trump's \" midnight\" rules .\n\nHere are some of the most important ways Trump changed Washington and the federal government:\n\nFrom the start of his term, Trump staffed his administration with lobbyists - hundreds of them, by our count - some of whom remain in career positions . He signed an executive order on ethics that was supposed to bar his political appointees from lobbying their former agencies for five years after they left government, though ProPublica found in 2018 that the order was not being enforced . Then, one of his final acts as president was to rescind that order, calling into question whether the swamp was drained or if Trump had built a yacht club along its murky waters.\n\nTrump's deregulatory successes left some federal agencies understaffed , underfunded and unable to function properly , as demonstrated by his administration's botched response to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic . Even if Biden is able to restaff and Congress allocates the money to restore slashed budgets, it will take years to reverse rules put in place by Trump.\n\nBiden has set about trying to reverse at least some of Trump's actions that rolled back the rights of LGBTQ Americans , like the military's ban on transgender service members , and a 2020 \"conscience rule\" that helped to shield federally funded health care providers who refused to provide services on religious or moral grounds.\n\nThe new administration will almost certainly have to employ one of the tools Trump used to halt or undo former President Barack Obama's regulations: a little-known law called the Congressional Review Act.\n\nThe law, passed in 1996 by a GOP majority in the House, which was led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, gave Congress the ability to pass a simple resolution of disapproval and thereby reject any new major regulation implemented by a president. It also permanently prevents these voided regulations from being resurrected in any similar form without a subsequent act of Congress. In the two decades after it was enacted, the CRA was only used successfully once.\n\nThen came Trump.\n\nHis 2016 election resulted in a flood of regulatory rollbacks - 15 in the first year of his term alone.\n\nNow that the Congressional Review Act has been established as a political power tool, Biden and a Democratic-led House and Senate will likely use it to repeal as many of the Trump administration's midnight regulations as they possibly can in the limited window of time available to them.\n\nProPublica tracked more than 75 such regulations from Trump's final months in office, at least 50 of which were finalized before Biden's inauguration.\n\nAmong federal institutions, the judicial branch will remain in Trump's shadow the longest. The one-term president was responsible for installing more than 225 federal judges and three Supreme Court justices to lifetime appointments. A ProPublica analysis highlighted the relative youth of Trump's judicial appointments. Given the age of many of these judges, they are likely to remain in their positions for 30 years or more before retiring.\n\nThe Senate's then-majority leader, Mitch McConnell, handed Trump a gift by refusing to hold hearings in 2016 for Obama's nominee to fill a Supreme Court vacancy. In April 2017, that seat was filled by Neil Gorsuch, who, at age 49, was the youngest justice on the court.\n\nThe subsequent appointments of Brett Kavanaugh (53 when confirmed) and Amy Coney Barrett (47 when confirmed) made clear Trump's goal of placing young, deeply conservative justices into lifetime appointments.\n\nAccording to a ProPublica analysis , all three Trump-appointed justices could remain with the court until 2050 or beyond by simply staying through or slightly beyond the average age of retirement for the court.\n\nTrump's relative success with Supreme Court nominations was only part of the GOP strategy to remake the federal courts. McConnell and Republican leadership deliberately held back on confirming Obama's judge nominations in hopes of the White House changing parties after 2016. In his last two years in office, Obama only saw two of his appellate nominees confirmed to the bench. By contrast, Trump seated a cavalcade of judges during his term - 19 appeals court spots and nearly 50 U.S. district court judges in 2018 alone.\n\nIn one four-year term, Trump placed 54 judges in federal appellate courts, and seated 174 district court judges. By contrast, Obama and former President George W. Bush seated 55 and 62 appellate judges, respectively, over the course of their eight-year stays in office.\n\nFollowing the death of liberal Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 2020, the issue of \"packing the court\" by adding more justices became a talking point for both progressives who supported the idea and for Trump, who claimed Biden would use the strategy to change the court's ideological balance. However, Biden has not publicly supported this idea, and it would be unlikely to succeed in Congress.\n\nThe Constitution prescribes no specific number of justices for the Supreme Court, which over the years has had as few as six justices and as many as 10. The current nine-justice court was established in 1869, though there have been multiple proposals to expand the court, most notably in 1937, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt made a failed plan to expand the Supreme Court to as many as 15 justices.\n\nThe Democrats' win of both Georgia Senate seats in January means Biden should be able to fill vacancies in the judiciary, with Republicans unable to block hearings and Vice President Kamala Harris acting as the tiebreaker for any 50-50 confirmation votes. However, finding nominees that satisfy all 48 Democrats and the 2 independents who caucus with them may prove to be a challenge.\n\nThere is also the question of how many Supreme Court seats Biden will have the opportunity to fill. Stephen Breyer is the only justice currently above the typical retirement age. Justice Clarence Thomas, the longest tenured of the nine, is 72. According to the ProPublica analysis, if he stays on the bench through typical retirement age, he would remain in place through 2029.\n\nLong-tenured district and appellate court judges who meet specific age and experience requirements can declare \"senior\" status, which allows for their seats to be filled by the president while they continue working. There are currently dozens of judges eligible for this designation. On Inauguration Day, District Court Judge Victoria Roberts of Michigan's Eastern District announced her intention to transition into senior status. It remains to be seen how many others will choose this path.\n\nEven though Trump began his term with Republicans in control of both chambers, the GOP was unable to pass major bills on issues like immigration and abortion because it couldn't get the 60 votes it needed to end debate in the Senate and get to a final vote. The two signature Trump legislative efforts - on health care and tax cuts - were expedited by using the budget reconciliation process, which limits what can be put into the legislation but means the bill is not subject to a cloture vote.\n\nIn his public remarks, Trump sold the Republicans' 2017 tax reforms as mainly benefiting the middle class and creating jobs.\n\nYet the new tax law's cap on deductions for state and local taxes, along with the elimination of some mortgage deductions, resulted in a trillion-dollar drop in overall home values nationwide - \"a very big deal to families whose biggest financial asset is the equity they have in their homes,\" wrote ProPublica's Allan Sloan .\n\nProPublica has reported on a number of ways in which the 2017 tax cuts benefited America's wealthiest, including some Trump appointees . Similarly, the plan's Opportunity Zone tax breaks, which were purportedly intended to spur investment in lower-income neighborhoods, have repeatedly gone to billionaire investors and developers for projects that were not new or are of dubious value, like a Florida superyacht marina .\n\nRead More\n\nCritics warned the cuts would raise the national debt, which then stood at around $20 trillion. Trump insisted otherwise, telling Fox News' Sean Hannity in 2018 that when the bill \"really kicks in, we'll start paying off that debt like it's water.\"\n\nDespite Trump's pledge that the revenue lost from the tax cuts would be recouped by tariffs and increased productivity, the national debt continued to rise, even before the COVID-19 pandemic. The $1.563 trillion budget deficit from 2019 was higher than it had been in all but one year under the Obama administration, which spent $1.652 trillion in 2010 in an effort to end the economic downturn that resulted from the crash of the housing market. More than a year after signing the tax law, Trump's own White House referred to the then-$22 trillion national debt as a \"grave threat to our economic and societal prosperity.\"\n\nThen the coronavirus hit, requiring trillions of additional dollars in spending to keep Americans working, fed and in their homes. As of Dec. 31, 2020, the national debt stood at $27.75 trillion, up 39% from $19.95 trillion four years earlier and at its highest level relative to our economy since the end of World War II.\n\nDuring the 2020 campaign, Biden proposed income tax increases on individuals earning more than $400,000 annually, repealing the cap on state and local tax deductions, and raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, splitting the difference between Trump's level and the 35% rate that was in place before 2017.\n\nAs experts have noted , the new president may face an uphill battle trying to sell any tax hike while the economy remains troubled. While the Democratic Party now controls both chambers of Congress, Biden cannot afford even a single defector in the Senate if he hopes to succeed there. Additionally, Biden hopes to push through a $1.9 trillion stimulus package in the early part of 2021 , which will further inflate the debt.\n\nOn the day of his inauguration in 2017, Trump signed Executive Order 13765 , instructing the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the heads of other relevant federal bodies to try to \"waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation\" of any part of the Affordable Care Act if they deemed that it \"would impose a fiscal burden on any State or a cost, fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden on individuals, families, healthcare providers, health insurers, patients, recipients of healthcare services, purchasers of health insurance, or makers of medical devices, products, or medications.\"\n\nThe order was a clear indication of the administration's determination to undermine Obamacare, which had helped an estimated 20 million people get health insurance during its first two years .\n\nWhile the House passed its version of a health care plan, dubbed the American Health Care Act, in May 2017, what followed was a series of failed attempts to craft a Senate version of the bill. The process came to an end in July 2017 with the Health Care Freedom Act, dubbed a \"skinny repeal\" bill with no real replacement plan. That too failed in the Senate, when Sen. John McCain of Arizona, with a now-famous thumbs-down gesture, joined fellow Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine and all Democrats in voting \"no.\"\n\nThe closest Trump would come to repealing the ACA came later in 2017, when - as part of the Republican tax bill - he effectively negated the individual mandate, which required individuals to carry a minimum level of healthcare coverage or face an annual penalty of up to $695; the tax bill reduced the amount of that penalty to $0. The Trump administration also cut back on marketing for the ACA's open enrollment periods and expanded the availability of short-term limited-duration insurance policies , which are generally less expensive than those that meet ACA requirements but offer fewer protections, particularly for preexisting conditions . Despite repeated promises from the president that a true ACA replacement was in the offing, it never materialized .\n\nThough Obama's legislation remains on the books, its initial surge in coverage numbers began to reverse itself after 2017. According to a 2020 Kaiser Family Foundation report , there were 28.9 million uninsured nonelderly Americans by the end of 2019, an increase of 2.2 million since the beginning of 2017, with the number expected to continue rising in 2020 due to the historic levels of unemployment resulting from pandemic-related layoffs and closings.\n\nIn addition to resulting in more uninsured Americans, the Obamacare repeal campaign set the tone of bluster, partisanship and misinformation that would come to define many aspects of the Trump years. As ProPublica reported in May 2017, backers of the repeal legislation had engaged in a campaign of inaccurate information, misleading euphemisms and a curated online discussion bubble in which members of Congress blocked critical comments from their constituents.\n\nBiden and the new Democratic-led Congress could reinstate the individual mandate, but financial penalties for uninsured Americans will be difficult for the White House and legislators to sell to a public living through mass unemployment. Rather, as part of his $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package , the new president hopes to maintain insurance rolls by increasing the value of the Premium Tax Credit - a refundable credit that helps eligible taxpayers afford insurance coverage - so that their net cost of insurance premiums is no more than 8.5% of an individual's yearly income.\n\nThe new White House will face pressure from within its own party as progressive Democrats push to replace traditional insurance plans with a single-payer \"Medicare for All\" plan. Support for this concept is increasing among the general public. According to a September 2020 report from Pew Research , 63% of Americans support at least some mix of government and private insurance plans, up 4 percentage points from the previous year. Support for a single national government program was up 6 percentage points year-over-year, rising from 30% to 36%. During the campaign, Biden did not push for a Medicare for All plan, but rather for expansion of the ACA marketplace via the \"public option,\" meaning government-run insurance plans that would compete with private insurers.\n\nIn early 2018, with nothing to show for his campaign promises and no indication that Mexico wanted any involvement in funding the border wall, Trump floated to then-Defense Secretary James Mattis the idea of using money earmarked for the armed forces to build it.\n\nIt would be nearly a year before Trump moved forward with this plan, setting off a slew of legal challenges, some involving the Supreme Court . Opponents said Trump did not have the authority to reallocate billions of congressionally appropriated military funds. The standoff over money for the wall resulted in the longest shutdown in U.S. government history . Congress, now with a Democratic majority in the House, eventually agreed to give Trump part of what he requested, but with some restrictions. The president was also allowed to use billions that had previously been allocated for the military's counter-narcotics efforts.\n\nAfter construction on the wall finally began in earnest, a ProPublica/Texas Tribune investigation found that costs for the structure were running significantly higher than expected. For example, the Army Corps of Engineers issued two contracts worth $788 million for construction of one 83-mile stretch of wall. In less than a year, the value of those contracts increased by more than $1 billion. Within a year, after the length of the wall segments in those contracts was extended by 63% to 135 miles, the total cost more than tripled to $3 billion. ProPublica and the Tribune found multiple instances where the value of border wall contracts was increased through the use of supplemental contracts without any competitive bidding.\n\nRead More\n\nWhile more than 400 miles of wall were constructed by the end of Trump's term, only about 80 miles involved building a barrier where none had existed before, according to news reports . The Washington Post reported that Biden may be obligated to build more than 200 additional miles of wall.\n\nOn his first day in office, Biden issued an executive order describing the wall as a \"waste of money that diverts attention from genuine threats to our homeland security.\" The order pauses construction and spending on the wall \"to the extent permitted by law,\" leaving open the possibility that construction could continue or that money will continue to be spent on the project. Our investigation confirmed that some wall contracts come with hefty termination fees. One agreement stipulates a cancellation fee of nearly $15 million.\n\nThe legacy of the Trump administration will be one of erosion , both of norms and of trust in government. Arguably the strongest example is Trump's yearslong campaign to convince the American people that their elections are not secure.\n\nTrump became president by winning the electoral college in 2016, but he repeatedly insisted without evidence that he'd only lost the popular vote to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton because of widespread election fraud.\n\n\"I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally,\" Trump tweeted on Nov. 27, 2016, despite all evidence to the contrary . The next day, he added, \"Serious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California - so why isn't the media reporting on this? Serious bias - big problem!\" Again, his claims were not backed up by the facts .\n\nHis zeal for the voter fraud myth did not cool after taking office. A May 11, 2017, executive order created the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity to investigate, among other things, issues \"that could lead to improper voter registrations and improper voting, including fraudulent voter registrations and fraudulent voting.\"\n\nIn the end, the commission only met three times before Trump summarily dissolved it in January 2018, amid internecine legal squabbles and other troubles. Though the administration said the Department of Homeland Security would continue the commission's work, the Trump White House never unearthed any actual evidence of substantial voter fraud.\n\nThe commission was a failure, but it thrust members like Hans von Spakovsky into the spotlight. Von Spakovsky, a prominent purveyor of discredited voter fraud claims, would go on to become a central figure in some Republican efforts to restrict mail-in and early voting during the 2020 election.\n\nAs Trump and his surrogates stoked unfounded fears of dead people and undocumented migrants voting, Americans grew concerned about interference in elections. A Gallup poll released in early 2020 found that nearly 3 in 5 Americans no longer had confidence in the election process, an inversion from only a decade earlier when that same poll found that almost 3 in 5 Americans were confident in the integrity of their elections.\n\nWith the 2020 election drawing near, Trump preemptively claimed that if he lost on Election Day it would have to be the result of fraud.\n\n\"The Democrats are also trying to rig the election by sending tens of millions of ballots using the China virus as the excuse for allowing people not to go to the polls,\" Trump said during a June 2020 campaign event in Phoenix, Arizona. He later predicted, \"This will be, in my opinion, the most corrupt election in the history of our country, and we cannot let this happen.\"\n\nThe volume of ominous statements from Trump soared in the weeks leading up to the November election. According to The Washington Post's tally of Trump's false and misleading claims, the president made more than 1,500 such statements about the election between July 1 and Nov. 2, 2020.\n\nEven after Trump's legal team and his unofficial legal supporters failed more than 60 times to convince courts to overturn election results in multiple states, and after the Jan. 6 Stop the Steal rally escalated into an insurrection at the Capitol that left at least five people dead, a large number of Americans still believe in the fiction of a stolen election.\n\nAccording to a CNN/SSRS poll taken after the violence at the Capitol, 32% of Americans said they think Biden did not legitimately win the election. Nearly one-quarter of all respondents believe there is \"solid evidence\" that Biden actually lost. Three-quarters of Republican respondents said they had little or no confidence that elections reflect the will of American voters.\n\nThe 2020 election will not be the end of outrageous voter fraud myths. The longer-term effect is only just being seen, as state legislatures around the country reconvene for their new sessions, with a number of Republican-led assemblies already moving to restrict or repeal efforts to make voting easier.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, where most Republican lawmakers supported expanded mail-in voting even before the COVID-19 pandemic, the state Senate voted on its first day back to create a special committee to investigate election reforms .\n\n\"Far too many residents of Pennsylvania are questioning the validity of their votes or have doubt that the process was conducted fairly, securely and produced accurate results,\" state Sen. Jake Corman, who had voted for the 2019 election reforms , said about the commission in December. His statement echoed an argument similar to that made by U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz on Jan. 6 , only minutes before insurrectionists breached the Capitol.\n\nRead More\n\nSimilarly, Minnesota state Sen. Scott Newman, a Republican, recently introduced a bill to require photo identification from voters. Like Corman, he did not cite any evidence of specific fraud that would merit ID checks, just stated that \"millions of American citizens believe there was widespread fraud during the last election, and their loss of faith in the integrity of our election system alone justifies incorporating photo ID into our voting system.\"\n\nFiled under -\n\nChris Morran is ProPublica's audience editor for news, social and weekends.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

But as with much of what Parscale has claimed about his work and life, that's not the full story. This is.\n\nby Peter Elkind with Doris Burke\n\nThis article was co-published with Texas Monthly.\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nOn the evening of May 30, Brad Parscale, the campaign manager of Donald J. Trump for President Inc., gave a speech to a gathering of the faithful. Parscale is a striking figure: 6-foot-8, with a trademark Viking beard and a penchant for bombast. He was a phenom of the 2016 election, rising, in a matter of months, from an anonymous web designer in San Antonio to the Trump campaign's reputed digital savior. Parscale has become a frequent warmup act at Trump rallies and a prized attraction in GOP fundraising circles.\n\nOn this occasion, he was speaking to the Miami Young Republicans. Parscale regaled the audience with his litany of Trump's achievements, according to a recording of the speech (provided by Palm Beach Post reporter Christine Stapleton). He warned of the \"crazy socialist Democrats\" who want to \"slaughter\" babies in the third trimester; admit \"all of South America\" to the U.S. through open borders; and render jet-fueled planes illegal and \"farming cows\" extinct. \"I don't know about you guys,\" Parscale told them. \"I really like steak.\"\n\nParscale then turned to his own rhetorical question: \"How the heck did you get from East Topeka, Kansas, 43 years old, to become the right-hand man to the Trump family?\" That's a truly remarkable tale, although much, as it turns out, is not quite as Parscale describes it.\n\nSubscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\nIn the speech, Parscale painted his own life story as a testament to the need for Trump. He served up a vivid account of facing crushing personal and professional setbacks (\"I was down and out\") before launching a business on a shoestring, then prospering through hard work and self-reliance. He is evidence of the American dream, Parscale declared. His life, he said, shows \"why we all need to go out and fight for the president. So that all of our kids can have that same possibility to have that dream happen for them.\"\n\nIn fact, Parscale's accounts of his life and his work for the president comprise a classic Trumpian tale: They're a combination of hyperbole, half-truths and the occasional fiction. Indeed, Parscale shares more than one trait with his most important client. He has embraced political beliefs not in evidence before the 2016 campaign. Like Trump, he has adapted to opportunities as they arose. And like Trump, Parscale is largely unencumbered by the concerns for consistency and accuracy that are the hobgoblins of smaller minds. \"When I give a speech, I tell it like a story,\" Parscale says when asked about his biographical embellishments and errors. \"My story is my story.\"\n\nConsider what Parscale has said about his own compensation this campaign season. He has repeatedly emphasized that he is refusing to take the customary cut of the campaign's digital ad spending. \"I felt like as campaign manager it would seem not very ethical and very good of myself to pay myself a percentage of my decisions,\" Parscale told CNN earlier this year. Instead, he said, he is accepting a relative pittance for his efforts: an annual \"retainer\" of $300,000, plus unspecified bonuses. \"I wanted to set a high mark,\" he told Breitbart News. As he put it: \"I don't do this for a percentage. I do this for my country and for President Trump.\"\n\nBut that wasn't the full story. Parscale's no-commissions policy did not apply when the client was the Republican National Committee, whose main mission, at least when it comes to employing Parscale's firm, is reelecting Trump. That work represented $18 million in billings for Parscale Strategy since he was named 2020 campaign manager, dwarfing the $4.8 million his companies have received directly from Trump committees.\n\nIn an interview for this article, Parscale confirmed he was taking commissions on the portions of the $18 million that was used to buy advertising, but he declined to discuss specifics. Parscale said he saw no conflict of interest because the party was making the decisions. \"That's the RNC's money,\" he said. \"If they call me tomorrow and say, 'We're not spending any more money on this,' there's nothing I can do.\"\n\nParscale then changed his position following that interview and two articles in other publications that examined Parscale's compensation . The RNC told ProPublica and Texas Monthly in early September that, at Parscale's request, it would no longer purchase digital ads through his firms. \"Going forward, all RNC digital buys will be made directly to the host sites,\" party spokesman Mike Reed says. \"This is to ensure complete transparency and to give Democrats and the press no way to mislead and wrongly accuse anyone of impropriety.\"\n\nParscale and his fees have attracted an unusual amount of attention, but they're only part of the story. He has also spearheaded what appears to be the Trump campaign's takeover of the RNC to the benefit of the president - and the seeming detriment of other Republican candidates. Other presidents have consolidated control over their party; similar criticisms were made of Barack Obama. But the extent of Trump's takeover is unprecedented, according to experts. They say it inflicted damage on Republican congressional candidates in the 2018 elections, and could do so again in 2020.\n\nOne previously unreported example: Since Trump's election in 2016, critical \"voter scores\" - sophisticated polling-based analytics that the RNC provides to party committees and candidates - have conspicuously omitted an essential detail for any down-ballot race: how voters in specific states and congressional districts feel about Trump. Republican insiders believe these analytics are being withheld to try and prevent GOP candidates from publicly distancing themselves from the president or leaking unfavorable results that embarrass Trump.\n\n\"They don't want you to know if it isn't good,\" says former RNC chairman Michael Steele, a vocal Trump critic. \"There's a lot of data they're sitting on that they're not sharing.\" Steele adds that today, \"the RNC is not an independent actor; the RNC is now a part of the Trump campaign. The question now isn't, 'What do you need?' The question is, 'Do you support Donald Trump?'\"\n\nIn both power and money, the 2020 Trump campaign dwarfs the 2016 incarnation. \"You have less than a handful of people who now control the entire ecosystem\" of the Republican Party, says one prominent former RNC official, and Parscale is one of that handful. A big part of his sway stems from the massive quantities of money he raises. Parscale sits atop a juggernaut that reported gathering $108 million just in the second quarter this year and that is well on its way to becoming what he claims will be America's first billion-dollar campaign.\n\nAll of which raises the ultimate question for Parscale: He won big in 2016 as an upstart among a small band of political insurgents. Can he win again in 2020 as the captain of an operation so big and established that one operative refers to it as the \"Death Star\"?\n\nIn political terms, Brad Parscale was a nobody before his association with Trump. In the span of just a few years, he has reinvented himself, transforming from an apolitical digital geek - building local websites in T-shirts and cargo shorts for a small San Antonio company - into a hyperpartisan president's raging avatar, bestriding the national stage in Ermenegildo Zegna suits.\n\n\"He was not that guy three years ago,\" says John Dickson, a principal of Denim Group, a prominent San Antonio cybersecurity firm, who met Parscale during the 14 years Parscale worked in that city. \"He was not a bomb-thrower or an ideologue. He was a savvy business guy, a hustler.\"\n\nIndeed, before Trump, Parscale's Twitter feed was far more Deep Nerd than Deep State - exchanges of coding tips and bro talk. He almost never weighed in on politics. Back then, his Twitter targets weren't Bernie and Biden, but Luby's and Chipotle, for falling short on his culinary expectations (\"sad there are no standards on how much you get in a salad...\").\n\nParscale and his parents say he adapted so quickly to meeting Trump's needs because his own father is very much like him: impatient, unfiltered and larger-than-life.\n\n\"I'm not a silver-spoon-type person,\" Dwight Parscale declares during a three-hour conversation in the 19th Hole restaurant at Club at Sonterra, the San Antonio country club where he holds court many mornings. \"I worked my ass off all my life, and I didn't know any other way. ... Am I worth over a million bucks? Yes. But that's not that much today. I've never considered myself rich.\"\n\nDwight Parscale, 73, was a lawyer but says he abandoned the profession around age 50 after an unfriendly local judge handed down an \"outrageous\" opinion, prompting him to announce to friends, \"I'm going to beat the crap out of him!\" He adds, \"I finally calmed down and went home and told my wife I'm not going to practice law anymore.\"\n\nAside from Dwight Parscale's legal practice, he and his wife, Rita, operated a string of businesses over the years, sometimes three at once. They included a swimming pool company, a scuba shop, real estate enterprises, restaurants and a Western-themed nightclub featuring a mechanical bull imported from Fort Worth.\n\nBrad Parscale has spoken of a modest upbringing, describing himself as a \"farm boy from Kansas.\" In fact, he grew up on a suburban cul-de-sac. He attended Topeka-area public schools, where he was a good student and a basketball star. A frustrating college sports career, ended by injuries to his leg and back, took him to four schools. He graduated from Trinity University in San Antonio in 1999, majoring in international business and economics. (He regularly describes it, incorrectly, as an Ivy League school.)\n\nDwight Parscale, meanwhile, had become the CEO of a Topeka technology company, NewTek, and moved its headquarters to San Antonio before a falling-out with the founder that ended in litigation. The Parscales then relocated to Southern California, where Dwight Parscale became the CEO of a small 3D animation software company called Electric Image.\n\nBrad Parscale went to work for his dad after college, becoming sales manager for Electric Image at a salary of $95,000. Rita Parscale helped manage the company's books. By the fall of 2001, the Parscales say, they were trying to sell to private investors when the deal, and their business, collapsed amid the economic swoon that followed 9/11.\n\nIn his Miami speech, Parscale said he had \"just had my first child, married\" when he moved out to California, along with \"an adopted son,\" before the failure of Electric Image and the loss of his job, \"within a few months\" of the 2001 World Trade Center attacks, sent him reeling. \"In a year of that, I lost my wife. Not died - separated. ... We got divorced, ended back in Texas.\"\n\nIn fact, Parscale wasn't married then, much less divorced. He had become a father in July 1999, at age 23, just weeks after graduating from college. The mother was a 22-year-old woman he'd met while she was working at a San Antonio tanning salon he patronized; she had a son from a previous relationship.\n\nCourt records show that the two didn't marry until March 2003, three years and eight months after their daughter was born. Parscale filed for divorce in August 2004. The split wasn't finalized until October 2007, when he was 31. Parscale never adopted his first wife's son.\n\nElectric Image's failure is also more complex than he has portrayed it. The company filed for bankruptcy in August 2002, declaring $188,453 in assets and nearly $2 million in debt, including $100,068 owed to the IRS for unpaid withholding taxes.\n\nParscale and his parents improperly transferred company funds and assets to themselves, according to a lawsuit against the three family members filed by a U.S. bankruptcy trustee, a claim disputed by the family. Exhibits in the case show checks, all signed by Rita Parscale in August 2003, for $33,000 paid to Dwight Parscale, $4,800 to Rita Parscale and $6,200 to Brad Parscale. According to the bankruptcy trustee's filings, Dwight Parscale had taken the company's business records \"to the garbage dump\" before the family left California and returned to Texas.\n\nThe trustee also accused the Parscales of improperly transferring Electric Image assets for use by a new company in San Antonio, EI Technology Group, which later listed Brad Parscale as CEO. (He continued selling software through EI for years until 2009.)\n\nThe matter was finally settled in 2006, with the Parscales agreeing to repay a portion of the disputed funds. \"We paid out of our pocket $86,000,\" Rita Parscale says. She calls the claims of misappropriation \"a bunch of baloney.\"\n\nBack in San Antonio, Brad Parscale became a website developer, incorporating in October 2005 what became Parscale Media. He has repeatedly spun a memorable origin tale. He said he started the business with his last $500, seeking clients by approaching them in the tech aisle at a local Borders bookstore.\n\n\"Life is amazing,\" he wrote in a May 2016 tweet. \"My first day I had $500 to my name and tapped shoulders for work. No one knew me.\" In 2017, he tweeted from a speech in Monaco about delivering \"my story of starting with $500.\" In its online biography promoting him for paid speeches (fee range $25,000 to $40,000), the speaker's bureau representing Parscale repeats that \"he invested his last $500 in Parscale Media.\"\n\nParscale may have started his business in late 2005 with $500. But it's unlikely it was his last $500. Courthouse records show that Parscale, who had begun investing in rental properties, owned three San Antonio homes at the time (each carried a mortgage).\n\nThere was no question about the business's early struggles. In 2008, Parscale's operation was sandwiched between a car wash and a tattoo parlor and smack in the flight path of the San Antonio airport. \"Every time you had a meeting in there,\" recalls Ryan Kelly, a San Antonio digital marketing consultant who worked closely with Parscale, \"you'd feel like a plane was going to fly right through the office.\"\n\nFrom the start, Parscale displayed qualities that would serve him well with Trump. He was a great salesman. He was a quick study and intensely loyal to his customers. And he worked like a maniac.\n\nIn San Antonio, Parscale built a volume business. He did fast, inexpensive work for small enterprises like Dury's Gun Shop, Quest Plumbing and D&D Farm and Ranch. He pitched clients by day, often making cold calls, and cranked out websites at night. On the side, he sold his own software add-ons to website developers.\n\nAt the start, Parscale knew little about digital marketing and even less about design. But he recognized his limitations. Says Natalie Silva, a San Antonio marketing consultant who worked with Parscale for two years starting in 2007: \"He was the type of guy who would oversell capabilities and then figure it out - 'well, I'll go find someone.' He would bring in the people he needed to do the things he couldn't do.\"\n\nBy 2009, Parscale Media, on its website, claimed a staff of seven and pitched Parscale as \"a true pioneer of the industry\" with \"over 13 years of professional web experience.\" (That would date back to 1996, his sophomore year in college.) It also trumpeted \"prestigious\" Top 10 web designer awards \"as seen in\" Forbes and Texas Monthly magazines. In fact, both citations were paid marketing promotions, published as advertisements in the two publications.\n\nAs his reputation grew, Parscale sometimes found himself paired on projects with a San Antonio graphic and web designer named Jill Giles, who'd run her own small firm since 1984. Giles handled the projects' look and branding strategy; Parscale did the under-the-hood work.\n\nThe two could not have been more different. Giles was 20 years older, a tiny, soft-spoken woman with blond curls and refined taste; a committed Democrat, she socialized with urban liberals. Parscale was a red-headed giant with a booming voice who lived in the suburbs. He dressed, Giles later joked to friends, \"like a German tourist,\" wearing T-shirts, shorts and sandals with socks to work. (Giles declined to be quoted.)\n\nBut in an age when businesses built their reputations and brands online, marrying design and tech skills made sense. They formed Giles-Parscale Inc. in July 2011. They set up shop inside the walled compound Giles owned on the edge of downtown, building out separate, industrial-chic structures for the design and digital teams.\n\nAfflicted with chronic back pain from his basketball injuries, Parscale presided over his domain from an unusually tall standing desk; on difficult days, he sometimes conducted business stretched out on the floor.\n\nWith Parscale leading the sales effort, Giles-Parscale won prestigious new contracts. Dickson, the San Antonio tech businessman, saw Parscale dazzle the executive committee of the San Antonio Economic Development Foundation, winning its website and digital work. \"He's like Don Draper. He's a great pitchman,\" says Dickson. \"There are just so few who can walk in, pick up the vibe in the room and say the right thing.\"\n\nIt was just nine months after the merger, in April 2012, that Parscale got his first opportunity to work for the Trump Organization. Asked to bid on designing a website for Trump International Realty, Parscale - eager to land the legendarily cheap celebrity client - won the job with an outrageously low bid of $10,000.\n\nIn his Miami speech, Parscale described the Trump Organization call as coming at a moment when he was still struggling. \"At this point,\" he said, \"I have six employees. ... I'm living in an $80,000 house, driving a Dodge Charger.\" In fact, in 2012, Giles-Parscale had a staff of 30. Parscale lived in a $500,000 home with a swimming pool on a golf course and drove a Lexus.\n\nParscale simply \"made up\" his $10,000 price for the initial 2012 work, he later told The Washington Post , with the aim of hooking the Trumps as a client: \"I recognized that I was a nobody in San Antonio, but working for the Trumps would be everything.\"\n\nGiles-Parscale soon became the go-to choice for other Trump work: the Trump Winery website, Melania Trump's skin care products website; the Eric Trump Foundation website (Parscale did the latter work for free).\n\nIn November 2013, Eric Trump, in Texas for an event, stopped by Giles-Parscale with his future wife to meet the family's webmaster. Parscale took them out for a steak dinner afterward, then promoted the visit on Twitter : \"Hung out with \\@EricTrump & his fiancé today. Truly was honored to have their time. One #supercool couple.\"\n\nParscale insisted that Giles-Parscale made \"a lot of money\" from the Trump businesses. \"Over the next five years,\" reported the Post, \"the Trump Organization sent hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of website-related work to Parscale.\"\n\nA knowledgeable Giles-Parscale colleague says that's not true. \"We always lost money on the Trump commercial stuff. Brad wanted it so bad he would bid it ridiculously cheap. He would say, 'Oh no, this is going to lead to a lot of other work.'... We all knew that we should have been charging more money for it.\"\n\nWhat came next is widely known: In February 2015, the Trumps asked Parscale to craft a simple landing page for the presidential exploratory committee. Parscale did it for $1,500, completing the work on his laptop at home over a weekend. He got another call in June and agreed to build the Trump presidential campaign's website for $10,000.\n\nJill Giles was mortified. A lifelong Democrat, she told friends she found Trump's candidacy \"repellant,\" and she didn't want her firm to have anything to do with it. But Parscale reassured his partner: \"Nothing will come of this. This isn't going to last long.\"\n\nIndeed, 10 days after Trump announced his candidacy for president, Parscale met two top local Republicans for lunch. But he wasn't there to chat about the race for the White House. Parscale wanted their support as he considered running for a seat on the San Antonio City Council. Says one of the lunch participants, Robert Stovall, then the Bexar County Republican chairman: \"He was very serious about it.\"\n\nThe two men told Parscale they couldn't back him. The seat's conservative incumbent was likely to run one last time in 2017. They didn't want Parscale to challenge him. Throughout the conversation, Stovall says, one thing was clear: \"Brad didn't think the announcement of Trump running for president was going to be a long-term thing. Everyone was just chuckling about it.\"\n\nAfter Trump's upset victory in 2016, Parscale would receive acclaim for his central role in a campaign whose intensive, targeted use of social media was without precedent. But it was nondigital skills that proved essential to Parscale's ascent: learning to navigate the cutthroat culture of Trump's political world. \"He's a rare survivor of Trump 1.0,\" notes Kurt Luidhardt, co-founder of Prosper Group, a political consulting firm that worked on the 2016 campaign. \"That's a big feat to pull off.\"\n\nNot that there weren't some close calls for Parscale. The first came in late 2015, when an array of technical problems and lapses dogged the Trump website. Volunteer data wasn't getting promptly downloaded. State campaign offices weren't listed. And the website sometimes functioned poorly or crashed, hitting a low point in early December.\n\n\"Today was insane,\" Parscale wrote his bosses on Dec. 7, 2015, a day on which traffic spiked as hackers tried to overwhelm the website with a so-called distributed denial of service attack. His email's recipients included Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, political director Michael Glassner and communications chief Hope Hicks. \"About 4 p.m. CST time the traffic on the website increased by about 700,000x the normal traffic...The site has become very unresponsive because it is designed to do 200-300K people a day, not a million in a few minutes.\"\n\n\"I can build to handle these numbers,\" Parscale added, \"but at this time I have not spent the cost to make it work this large...I am sorry for the problems today, these numbers were just insane high fast.\"\n\nGlassner conferred by email with Matt Braynard, the campaign's data chief. The two men had been discussing the website problems for weeks. Glassner asked if the day's traffic would have been a problem if another company ran the Trump website. His email's subject line: \"Transition away from Brad.\"\n\n\"My suspicion was the answer was no,\" Braynard replied, \"but I've confirmed\" that the crash wouldn't have happened if another firm was running the site. He promised to quickly \"compose a summary of reasons why I believe we should transition.\"\n\nBut before he could do so, Glassner ended the discussion. \"We're going to stick with Brad,\" he emailed the next day. Glassner later explained the reason simply: \"Brad is considered family.\" (Braynard departed the campaign himself a few months later and now runs a nonprofit seeking to register conservative voters.)\n\nParscale had cultivated a crucial relationship with Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, who had taken a special interest in the campaign's digital efforts. Kushner became his most essential ally, enlisting Parscale as his proxy. Parscale understood a fundamental rule of life of Trump's world: The family's favor meant everything. \"He focused on the kids,\" says estranged Trump adviser Omarosa Manigault Newman, who met Parscale during the campaign. \"Once the kids like you, you're in with Trump.\"\n\nParscale regularly announced his interactions with various Trumps and assiduously flattered them. His Twitter profile today proclaims: \"Proud to work for America's best POTUS.\" He has described Trump as \"like a second father to me\" and recently proclaimed the family \"a dynasty that will last for decades.\" In tweets, he has called the Trumps \" the most amazing family \" and pronounced Kushner \" a great leader \" and \" a genius. Also the nicest guy ever. \"\n\nIn 2016, several factors conspired to elevate Parscale's role. One was the Trump campaign's raging distrust of the usual suspects from the GOP's political \"swamp,\" including both Washington operatives and the Republican National Committee.\n\nTrump also harbored contempt for conventional political practices. With his universal name recognition and domination of media headlines, Trump, who had pledged to bankroll his own primary campaign, had neither the need nor the desire to spend heavily on TV ads. That opened the door to a low-cost alternative in Parscale's sweet spot: Facebook.\n\nWith Kushner's backing and a small budget, Parscale began crafting Facebook ads directed at voters in key primary states. He'd also built a website page to sell \"Make America Great Again\" gear, which became a profit center for the campaign.\n\nThrough the end of 2015, the Trump campaign had paid Giles-Parscale just $39,000, mostly for \"website development,\" according to Federal Election Commission filings. By February 2016, his firm was receiving monthly six-figure sums for \"digital consulting.\" In June, he was named the campaign's digital director.\n\nBack in San Antonio, Parscale's work for Trump had roiled his firm. At the start, Parscale had managed the website from home on his laptop. But as his duties grew, he began tapping Giles-Parscale staff for help, recruiting a few designers after first asking, \"You got a problem with Trump?\"\n\nAt the start, Parscale had portrayed the Trump work as just another contract, telling a San Antonio reporter: \"We don't have a say in his views. We are just a mechanism for his delivery.\" Giles held to the view that he was, as ever, going overboard to please his client. \"I think he would have been equally enthusiastic if he were doing it for Hillary,\" she told friends.\n\nBy the spring primaries, it became impossible to pretend the work wasn't affecting Giles-Parscale. Campaign operatives were appearing regularly in the office. \"Nobody in their right mind thought it would go very far,\" Giles explained to friends months later. \"It was kind of scope creep. One day you wake up and say, 'Holy shit, how did this happen?'\"\n\nGiles finally told Parscale he needed to take the Trump work elsewhere. In early June, after it was clear that Trump had locked up the GOP nomination, Parscale secured office space on the third floor of a building near the San Antonio airport. He announced plans to hire a general election digital team of as many as a hundred staffers. With that, Parscale largely abandoned Giles-Parscale.\n\nAs Parscale assumed his new role as the Republican nominee's digital chief, he faced a big question: Now what do we do? He'd never helped run anything approaching the scale and complexity of a presidential campaign.\n\nAt that stage, most presidential nominees would already have dozens of experienced digital operatives on board. Clinton had more than a hundred. Trump had just one data staffer in New York and no data infrastructure. \"He had to scale from two people to national in 30 seconds,\" says Bill Skelly, a veteran RNC data consultant who worked with the 2016 campaign.\n\nParscale frantically began conferring with an array of consultants, seeking their advice. He was open about how much he didn't know and bombarded everyone with questions.\n\nWith Trump now the certain nominee, his campaign and the Republican National Committee - warily viewed as a haven of \"Never Trumpers\" - had forged an uneasy alliance. The RNC dispatched about a dozen staff members to San Antonio: experts in political strategy, email fundraising, data and digital marketing.\n\nConflict soon erupted over power and money. In June 2016, the most immediate flashpoint was the joint fundraising agreement Trump had signed with the RNC, as was customary for the party's presidential nominee. It provided for fundraising emails to go out in the name of the candidate, seeking donations of $200 or less.\n\nAll the funds were to flow into a joint committee, to be split 80-20 between the campaign and the party, and the two sides were to share the valuable donor data the emails generated. Trump clearly needed the help. He hadn't done any email fundraising during the primaries, and, as of June 1, he had just $1.3 million in his campaign coffers, compared with Clinton's $42 million.\n\nYet Trump was refusing to cooperate with the RNC, which wanted both its promised money and the donor lists. Trump's campaign, relying on private firms, finally dispatched his first fundraising letter on June 21, but it was a disaster. Although the campaign reported raising about $3 million in one day, more than half of the emails were caught in spam filters. Trump-haters had also slipped in prank addresses, generating embarrassing publicity about the campaign seeking illegal donations from members of the Australian, British and Icelandic parliaments.\n\nThe letter also directed all resulting donations to the Trump campaign rather than to the joint committee. RNC officials were furious. They wanted their promised cut - and control over the entire fundraising apparatus. \"There was a lot of real angst happening at that moment about Brad,\" recalls one GOP operative on the scene.\n\nThe RNC decided to play hardball. Ahead of the July 4 holiday weekend, it ordered all the RNC staffers working in San Antonio for Trump - more than a dozen - to leave. A former senior RNC official recalls the committee's digital director, Gerrit Lansing, explaining what happened this way: \"I pulled everyone out. They don't know what the fuck they're doing down there.\" Lansing told the RNC official he had even suggested to RNC chief of staff Katie Walsh that he would quit if Parscale wasn't fired.\n\nLansing declined to comment on the record about this episode. Walsh says \"there was a negotiation. ... I don't accept the premise that there was any sort of conflict.\"\n\nParscale arrived at his new offices on Friday, July 1, to find the place virtually empty. The lone RNC staffer who remained in town was Gary Coby, director of digital advertising, who had quickly gained Parscale's trust.\n\nCoby later stood by as Parscale phoned Kushner, effectively pleading for his job. \"He just kind of humbled himself to Jared,\" Coby recalls. \"He said: 'Obviously it's your guys' call. But I'll do anything for the candidate and the family. ... I love this family. ... Whatever you guys decide, you can count on me for anything you need or want.'\" Adds Coby, \"He was making his case as if his role was in jeopardy.\"\n\nParscale managed to keep his job - and to broker peace between the campaign and the RNC. Unlike much of Trump's inner circle, which viewed the GOP as the enemy, Parscale recognized that the party possessed critical political infrastructure that was impossible for Trump's makeshift team to replicate. As Parscale puts it: \"When I showed up at the RNC for my first meeting, I expected them to be my enemy. I was told that by many in Trump world. But I learned very quickly that for everyone to be successful, we need to be working hand in hand.\"\n\nBy the middle of the following week, Parscale and his bosses had signed on to a deal with the RNC. The Trump campaign would get all the proceeds from text message appeals and ads on social media sites like Facebook, YouTube, Google and Twitter. All donations from email fundraising - a bigger pot - would be split, though the RNC would cover all the costs. The RNC would run the joint email program and get access to Trump's growing donor file.\n\nNotes one campaign adviser: \"I've always thought that was the moment when Brad realized if I play nice with these people, they're going to play nice with me. And he's maintained that ever since. I am convinced to this day Brad is who he is because he made peace with the RNC. At every point since then, the benefit of that arrangement has been reinforced. He's navigated all the levers of power very effectively. Honestly, I think that's what he's best at.\"\n\nAny collaboration with the Trumps, of course, required support from the family, and Parscale worked to ensure that too. After the RNC fundraising showdown, he urged Kushner to sign off on joining forces with the RNC on the digital front. Parscale also met Eric Trump in Washington for a tour of the Trump International Hotel construction site, dirtying his suit before attending a high-level briefing at RNC headquarters on the party's plans for the campaign's ground game. Parscale then backed that plan during a three-hour Acela train trip with Eric to Manhattan and convinced him to support the plan, too. \"That's the day we all got married,\" Parscale says of the campaign and the RNC.\n\nAfter the 2016 election, much was written about the Trump campaign's use of new Facebook tools to \"microtarget\" voters, sophisticated data analytics and rapid-fire testing of thousands of campaign ad permutations. Parscale was hailed as an innovative \"genius,\" an impression he encouraged. \"I understood early that Facebook was how Donald Trump was going to win,\" he told Lesley Stahl, of \"60 Minutes,\" in 2017. \"Twitter is how he talked to the people. Facebook was going to be how he won.\"\n\nParscale also claimed that after being given broad new responsibilities late in the race, he'd spotted critical voter shifts and \"changed all the budgets around\" in the campaign's final days. He says he diverted \"every nickel and dime\" from hopeless Virginia and sure-win Ohio into advertising in Michigan and Wisconsin, where Trump notched narrow upsets.\n\n\"If you don't know what you're talking about, you think he's a 21st-century Steve Jobs,\" says a Republican consultant who knows Parscale. \"He's not an asshole. He's kind of a huckster. But he's smart enough to realize he's a huckster.\"\n\nParscale's true gift wasn't deploying new, cutting-edge uses for technology. It was skillful management: cobbling together and empowering a fast-moving, opportunistic digital team staffed by experts from the RNC, commercial ad placement firms and social media companies, which flew about a dozen employees into San Antonio to work alongside Parscale's team. At Parscale's direction, the digital operation carried out an unprecedented tilt toward social media, for which the Trump campaign spent nearly half its media budget.\n\nParscale's all-in approach toward Facebook was perfectly suited to his unique candidate. \"The key to digital success is bottling lightning, and with Donald Trump, the lightning strikes every five minutes,\" says Wesley Donehue, CEO of Push Digital, who worked on Marco Rubio's failed bid for the 2016 presidential nomination. \"You will never be able to replicate any digital strategy you had for Donald Trump for any other candidate or any corporation because there is no other Donald Trump.\"\n\nAcademics and political strategists say digital ads don't do much to persuade voters to switch candidates. They're aimed primarily at raising money, firing up the base and suppressing turnout among opposition voters - which perfectly matched Trump's needs.\n\nIn large part, Parscale's approach was a matter of necessity. In 2016, Trump was anathema to the GOP's traditional wealthy donors. But small-dollar contributors - \"the Army of Trump,\" Parscale would later call them - loved him. Trump's supporters were uniquely responsive to donation appeals on social media; his celebrity and gut-level appeal commanded eyeballs. \"The hardest thing in digital advertising is getting people's attention,\" says Coby. \"You got a cheat code with Trump.\"\n\nTrump's online and email fundraising generated a record $239 million in small-dollar donations, far more than Hillary Clinton's and more than two-thirds of his donation total, according to the nonpartisan Campaign Finance Institute. This made Trump competitive in a race where he was outspent nearly 2 to 1.\n\nParscale's growing role remained pretty much a secret for weeks into the general election race. But in mid-August, a new FEC filing was about to reveal that Giles-Parscale, an obscure San Antonio firm, had become the campaign's biggest vendor, receiving $12.5 million to date. That prompted Wired to run a quick, flattering profile of him. Trump, according to a former RNC official, soon began referring to Parscale as \"my $10 Million Man.\"\n\nBy the October FEC filing, that figure had multiplied. Giles-Parscale had received more than $20 million in the previous month, on its way to a jaw-dropping final $94 million tally from the Trump committees. After Trump read media reports spotlighting Parscale's most recent take, he erupted. Making a rare descent to the campaign's makeshift offices in Trump Tower, he cornered his digital director in the kitchen and flew into a spitting rage, screaming, \"Where the fuck is my money?\"\n\nParscale told Trump that the vast majority was simply passed through his firm and went toward buying ads. After salaries and various consulting fees, he insisted, he'd received only a small percentage - far below what's typical - as profit. Deputy campaign manager Dave Bossie, who had jumped between the two men, backed Parscale's story. According to two witnesses, the confrontation ended when Kellyanne Conway sneezed on Trump, distracting him from his fury.\n\nInside the walls of Giles-Parscale, Hillary Clinton's concession speech, on the morning after Election Day, was met with tears. For months, many at the firm had clung to a hope: Trump would surely lose; Parscale would come back. Everything would go back to the way it was.\n\nEarly in 2016, Parscale appeared to be putting down roots in San Antonio. In January, he and his second wife had spent $801,456 on a new 6,145-square-foot home in a gated country-club community near his parents. But after Trump's victory, he wasn't about to go back to selling websites. His partner, Giles, was just as eager to part ways.\n\nThe two partners agreed: Parscale, the hot commodity, would take the lead in seeking a buyer who could run the digital business. In the meantime, he was busy taking victory laps, attending election post-mortems at Harvard and in Silicon Valley, giving a speech in Monaco and sitting for interviews. He'd assigned a copywriter who had worked on the Trump campaign to write a Wikipedia profile for him.\n\nOn Aug. 1, 2017, the sale of Giles-Parscale was announced, to a company called CloudCommerce Inc. The commercial marketing business would become Parscale Digital. The design side would be renamed Giles Design Bureau. The political work - along with Parscale himself - would move to Florida as an independent company called Parscale Strategy.\n\nA press release described the deal as a $9 million all-stock purchase of Parscale's business. Parscale was also to receive $1 million in cash for his web hosting company, become the face of the parent company and receive a seat on the board. Giles got stock options, along with rent for use of her building and about $700,000 cash.\n\nIn reality, in selling to CloudCommerce, an obscure California penny-stock company, Parscale had jumped into a mess of his own making. For starters, his stock would be worth $9 million only if the shares rose exponentially. And the company, as Trump might say, was a doozy.\n\nCloudCommerce had lost money for seven straight years, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings, prompting its accountants to voice \"substantial doubt\" about its ability to remain \"a going concern.\" In the days before the acquisition was announced, its stock was trading at less than a penny.\n\nThe company had a distinctly dodgy past. A former CEO and a second executive had pleaded guilty to federal fraud charges in a scheme to pump up the price of the company's shares. Its current CEO had once filed for personal bankruptcy. CloudCommerce, whose leadership had vowed to rapidly grow the enterprise enough to uplist it onto a major exchange, had changed names and business strategies three times, while seeking to entice acquisition targets, as one email put it, with the prospect of \"riding the tidal wave\" of company shares \"to early retirement.\" (CloudCommerce did not respond to requests for comment.)\n\nAfter the sale, Parscale began deploying his digital-marketing tactics on a new product: himself.\n\nOn Aug. 8, he tweeted about a 500% spike in CloudCommerce's share price , from less than a penny to 5 cents, that had greeted the announcement.\n\nMuch like Trump, CloudCommerce and its new marquee player worked to lure business by creating a premium brand that would convey the value of his personal magic. They called it \"the Parscale Effect.\" Digital ads for Parscale Strategy's website, which featured juddering images of Parscale and admiring media headlines (\"Donald Trump's Michael Bay\"), declared: \"Brad Parscale shaped the 2016 presidential election with a data driven digital strategy to influence action. Find out how the Parscale Effect can transform your business.\"\n\nParscale approached political contacts, asking if they'd want to sell their firms in exchange for CloudCommerce stock, according to two people with direct knowledge. At least two turned him down. One recalls Parscale's pitch: \"He told me he was going to list CloudCommerce on Nasdaq, and we were all going to be really rich.\"\n\nParscale's political success intrigued some high-profile clients. In mid-2017, Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks, hired Parscale for a \"sales analytics\" project, to see if he could help sell basketball tickets. \"I figure, we'll see if what he does can make a difference. ... I'm a big believer that when it comes to data, you don't take sides. You look to see results,\" says Cuban, a reality TV star who has toyed with running for president. In the end, Parscale's impact was \"in line with what we did with other advanced metrics companies,\" says Cuban. \"It helped, but wasn't anything dramatic.\"\n\nParscale was hired to boost ticket sales for \"Only the Brave,\" a Hollywood movie about an elite Arizona firefighting team. He retained a Trump surrogate, Marcus Luttrell, a former Navy SEAL and war hero who was depicted in the movie \"Lone Survivor,\" to endorse the film, according to Variety, and Parscale promoted the movie on Twitter without disclosing he'd been paid to do so: \"A film about real American heroes. Risked it all to save others. Can't wait to honor these men by watching the movie! #onlythebrave #maga\"\n\nUltimately, CloudCommerce was unable to successfully exploit Parscale's commercial business, which largely went on hiatus as Parscale turned back to politics. CloudCommerce continues to lose money and bleed cash. The company's SEC filings now list Parscale's role as Trump's campaign manager as a \"risk factor,\" citing the president's unpopularity with some employees and customers.\n\n\"Brad thought if he got on board and applied some of his techniques, a penny stock becomes a dollar stock and $1 million becomes $100 million,\" says Jeremy Sloan, a San Antonio lawyer who represented Parscale in the CloudCommerce deal and has known him for a decade. \"I remember telling him: 'Dude, you're taking a risk here - selling your whole company, all these assets you're selling for stock. If you go from one penny to $3, that's great. But if you go from one to zero, that $9 million headline turns into $90,000.'\"\n\nAs of Sept. 9, CloudCommerce shares were trading for less than a cent.\n\nParscale's efforts to monetize his role in Trump's victory met with more success in the political world.\n\nTrump pioneered the nonstop presidential campaign, filing for reelection on the day of his inauguration, and Parscale positioned himself to capitalize on it. He incorporated Parscale Strategy, his political-consulting business, just 10 days later. Although Parscale lacked a formal campaign title until being named campaign manager in February 2018, he never stopped working for Trump - or getting paid for it.\n\nDuring the 14 months before Parscale's selection, his firms received more than $13 million. The money came from three different Trump campaign committees, the RNC, the presidential inaugural committee, a pro-Trump super PAC and a \"dark money\" organization. Parscale unsuccessfully sought work from at least two other GOP campaign committees.\n\nParscale simultaneously served as a co-founder of and senior adviser to America First Policies, a pro-Trump \"dark money\" group, and its sibling, the super PAC America First Action, which quickly became a paid refuge for Trump campaign veterans. The two groups are allowed to raise unlimited sums but are legally barred from coordinating with the campaign. Activist group Common Cause claims, in complaints to the FEC and the Justice Department, that the two groups have illegally coordinated with the Trump campaign. The complaints are still pending. (A spokesperson for America First declined to comment.)\n\nUp through his appointment as Trump's campaign manager on Feb. 27, 2018, the two America First groups paid Parscale's firm more than $3.5 million for \"media advocacy,\" website services and work in congressional special-election campaigns. Days after his appointment, America First ceased paying Parscale Strategy, presumably to avoid running afoul of laws barring the super PAC from coordinating with Trump's campaign.\n\nInstead, America First Action soon began making payments for similar services to a new entity, incorporated in Delaware on March 2, called Red State Data & Digital. Parscale told ProPublica and Texas Monthly that he formed Red State to allow his employees to continue working for America First while he distanced himself from the group. Parscale didn't mention that one of the employees was his wife, a fact subsequently revealed by CNN. Red State Data & Digital has received $923,201 from America First Action.\n\nRed State represents Parscale's attempt to channel those funds to a legally separate entity. \"The lawyers suggested it for firewall purposes so it would have its own billing,\" says Parscale. \"It was legally recommended to me. I don't even see the bills. I have employees that work for them, and they are firewalled from me.\"\n\nSuch maneuvers are part of \"a really troubling trend\" - a \"fig leaf\" - to form campaign vendors that are \"legally distinct but practically inseparable\" from a campaign, says Adav Noti, former associate general counsel for the FEC, who is now senior director for the nonprofit Campaign Legal Center. \"One serves the super PAC, one serves the campaign, but they're run by the same people. You can firewall off staff people, but you can't firewall your own brain. I would be very skeptical about that. Candidates and their advisers are not supposed to be coming in any contact with soft money.\"\n\nIn 2016, Parscale, out of necessity, ceded much of the Trump campaign's digital operations to the RNC. For the 2020 election, the tables are turned: Trump's reelection campaign has effectively taken over the party organization.\n\nThe tone was set early at the top, with the installation of Ronna McDaniel, a fierce Trump loyalist, as RNC chair. But with Parscale's help, Trump's control over the committee has gone deeper. The group's willingness to do Trump's bidding has extended to its handling of voter data, for which Parscale has helped empower two former RNC chiefs of staff (who happen to be married to each other), Katie Walsh and Mike Shields. They're the winners in an intraparty struggle that has shifted power, money and staff from the RNC to the party's private repository of voter information, called the Data Trust. Parscale was named to the Data Trust board in May 2017.\n\nThe changes have degraded the GOP's data operation, which is critical for winning elections, according to critics, including Bill Skelly, a longtime Republican data consultant no longer doing RNC work, and Jesse Kamzol, an RNC data director who was ousted in mid-2017.  They believe out-of-date and incomplete information in the party-supplied voter files, used for voter contact and turnout efforts, contributed to the GOP's poor performance in the 2018 midterms.\n\nOne example: sophisticated RNC voter score projections for Rep. John Culberson, a nine-term incumbent defending a suburban Houston seat held by Republicans for a half-century, showed Culberson winning his race handily, with a 56% to 35% margin among likely voters 11 weeks before Election Day, documents reviewed by ProPublica show. Other polls during this period consistently showed Culberson and Democrat Lizzie Fletcher in a far closer race. Culberson ultimately lost 52.5% to 47.5%.\n\nFormer RNC data experts blame such problems on poor data \"hygiene,\" the tedious work of keeping the files accurate and current. Says one: \"They're getting wrong addresses, wrong phone numbers, wrong emails. ... They're not updating it. They're building voter files and political data sets. It's not a technical thing; it's kind of an art. Imagine you suddenly went from having a bunch of Picassos and Monets. Then you go to someone who can finger-paint.\"\n\nShields, who served as a senior adviser to the Data Trust until July 31, says all changes occurred \"with the full knowledge of the Trump campaign and Brad.\" He adamantly denies any systemic problems. He and RNC officials defend the quality of the data and blame the criticism on a \"small pocket\" of political operatives who have lost business in the Trump era. Skelly denies any such motivation, saying, \"It is right to continue to innovate and look for change, but not for its own sake.\"\n\nMore conspicuously, since Trump's election, the RNC - at his campaign's direction - has excluded critical \"voter scores\" on the president from the analytics it routinely provides to GOP candidates and committees nationwide, with the aim of electing down-ballot Republicans.\n\nRepublican consultants say the Trump information is being withheld for two reasons: to discourage candidates from distancing themselves from the president, and to avoid embarrassing him with poor results that might leak. But they say its concealment harms other Republicans, forcing them to campaign without it or pay to get the information elsewhere.\n\nIndeed, RNC \"voter score\" documents from 2018 include a wealth of voter information for a given district, including attitudes toward the major parties, state elected officials, local candidates, critical issues and even Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. There is no data on Trump. To the contrary, according to one GOP expert, 2016 Trump information previously made available was conspicuously withheld starting in mid-2017.\n\n\"There has been a major decision to lock down the Trump voter scores,\" says a former national GOP data official, who was repeatedly blocked from obtaining the information. He calls this \"Trump-first mentality\" at the RNC \"outside the norm\" and a \"major hindrance\" to the success of down-ballot candidates.\n\nAccording to RNC documents, the scores are used to guide an array of campaign efforts, including field programs, fundraising, digital advertising and communications. Says a former RNC data officer: \"It's definitely hurting the party not to release that information. I wish we could have handed it over.\"\n\nCurrent and former party officials from two major battleground states confirm that the RNC refused their repeated requests for Trump data. \"What voters in our state think about Donald Trump matters,\" says the executive director for one state. \"There are people who loved our governor but were turned off by the president. We deliver different messages to people who need to be convinced to come out to our side. How are we supposed to run campaigns if we're flying blind on thinking about the president?\"\n\nWhen asked about this, Walsh, who serves as a senior adviser to the RNC, embraces the proposition that the committee now - properly - does the president's bidding. Because Trump effectively paid for the voter data by raising money for the RNC, according to this view, his campaign was fully entitled to withhold it even from other Republicans. \"I don't think most campaigns give their data out to other campaigns for free,\" Walsh says. \"So I don't see why the president would be expected to. That's all data work done by the RNC, and the head of the party is the president. So it's his data.\"\n\nSays one veteran GOP consultant: \"They should just put 'TRUMP' signs in front of the Republican National Committee building now, just like every other building he's got.\"\n\nThe 2020 Trump campaign could not be more different from 2016. Parscale has been methodically assembling a political war machine, largely along traditional lines. He has created a large-dollar fundraising network; begun training sessions for field recruits; and established outreach groups for African Americans, women and Hispanics. (In 2016, the campaign didn't even translate its website into Spanish.) Parscale has also spent tens of millions building contact files of Trump donors and supporters, harvested from responses to Facebook ads and rally sign-ups.\n\nParscale's life feels a lot bigger-scale these days, too. He now lives in a $2.4-million home on the Intracoastal Waterway in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. He now drives a Ferrari and a BMW X6. Since his star turn on \"60 Minutes,\" Parscale has become a recognizable conservative political celebrity. He has 361,000 Twitter followers, up from 3,793 just three years ago.\n\nParscale has assumed the role of Trump's troll-in-chief, backing his boss's boasts and false claims; generating ads playing to voters' fears; twisting the knife on the president's opponents; and caricaturing Democrats' policies. Recently, the Trump campaign circulated an ad on Facebook claiming that every Democratic presidential candidate would eliminate private health insurance. As a website called Popular Information first pointed out , the ad included a photo of five candidates raising their hands affirmatively at their June 27 debate, but it omitted the fact that they were responding to a different question. When I asked him about the ad, Parscale ignored the false photo and displayed some Trumpian defiance. \"Make no mistake,\" he says. \"All Democrats from Bernie to Biden will eliminate private insurance either outright or as a consequence of the public option crowding out private insurance.\"\n\nParscale seems to revel in the combat - at least part of the time. \"I barely leave the house,\" he says. \"We don't even go to dinner any more. We eat in. It's not worth it anymore.\" The world is now divided among fans who want to pose with him for a selfie and antagonists who'd rather throw things at him. In that way, as in so many others, he has come to resemble his boss.\n\nCorrection, Sept. 11, 2019: This story originally misidentified where the firefighting team that is the subject of the movie \"Only the Brave\" is from.

      "text": "ProPublica logo\n\nAs promised, President Trump kept it short, and largely avoided lofty language.\n\nby Richard Tofel\n\nAhead of President Donald Trump's inaugural address , it seemed no one knew exactly what to expect.\n\nToday was clearly an occasion for the use of the teleprompters that Trump used to mock his predecessor for employing. But, with the prepared text scrolling before him, would Trump offer the sobriety of his speech after meeting the Mexican president last August, or that of Election Night - or the bellicosity of his Convention acceptance speech? Sobriety won the day.\n\nBut the speech was much more than sober. It largely lacked lofty language, but contained a full-throated populist vision, delivered with confidence, and signaled this from the start in one of its most memorable lines: \"Today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another, but we are transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the people.\" This might be heard to echo Ronald Reagan's 1981 statement that \"government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem,\" but that would actually miss Trump's point: The speech did not oppose government - it opposed the governors.\n\nPerhaps the most striking element of the speech is how positive it remained throughout. Yes, it painted a dark vision of the state of the country today, accentuating the negative in this respect as almost all presidents who succeed a person of the other party do. But the blame for these ills was cast only on two domestic players: an undefined \"Establishment\" and, most tellingly, \"Washington\" and \"politicians,\" implicitly of both parties, \"who are all talk and no action constantly complaining but never doing anything about it.\"\n\nTrump once again, as at his Convention, made a presumably conscious play for Franklin Roosevelt's \"forgotten man\" of 1932. \"The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. Everyone is listening to you now,\" Trump declared. But while some on the right have tried to recast this phrase and return it to the meaning of William Graham Sumner, who used it first in 1918 to refer to taxpayers forced to pay for reforms, Trump made no such allusions. Government must be part of the solution to his promises, if only because those promises are being made by the new head of the government.\n\nAnd therein lies the great risk of the speech. The new president pledged today to rid the country of the problems of drugs, crime, inner city poverty and closed factories, and to launch an ambitious program of infrastructure spending. He pledged to \"eradicate completely from the face of the earth\" what he predictably called \"radical Islamic terrorism.\" None of these promises are likely to be literally fulfilled. Trump's pledge to \"never, ever let you down\" seems a dangerous echo of Jimmy Carter, who said the same thing, and received 40 percent of the vote when he ran for re-election. The question then will be whether enough has been done to avoid popular disappointment.\n\nAs President-elect Donald Trump picks his top officials, we're laying out the best accountability reporting on each. Read the story.\n\nIncoming President Donald Trump's business deals span the globe. We asked the Trump Organization about each of these deals. Read the story.\n\nA striking contrast in the speech was that between its pleas for domestic unity - Trump twice called for racial tolerance - and international division. On the latter score, it is worth comparing this from John Kennedy exactly 56 years ago, \"we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty,\" with this from Trump today: \"Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families. We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs.\"\n\nOther questions ahead of today's speech went more to style than to substance. Would Trump be gracious and thank his predecessor, as each new president since Carter in 1977 has done? He did. Would he be afflicted by the nervous sniffling of his debate performances (and the Mexican speech), or display the self-confidence that made those exceptions stand out? He sniffled a bit, but not nearly as much as in the debates - he seemed much more confident today than he did then.\n\nOne of the few things Trump and his aides said about the speech in advance was that it would be short. In the event, it was. The President clocked in at 1,454 words. That compares with 1,366 words in JFK's inaugural address - the most memorable of the modern era. It is far longer than FDR's fourth inaugural, which, at 573 words, was the shortest modern address - and nowhere near Washington's second inaugural, in 1793, which set an enduring record for brevity at 136 words. But it was considerably shorter than Barack Obama's largely unmemorable first inaugural address (everyone, it seems, remembers the day, but, unusually for Obama, very little of what was said); that speech ran 2,409 words.\n\nOne thing was entirely predictable: how the speech would end. Anyone paying any attention at all for the last 18 months should have known its last point would be a call to \"Make America Great Again.\"\n\nRichard Tofel\n\nRichard Tofel was the founding general manager of ProPublica from 2007-2012, and served as president from January 2013-September 2021.\n\nGet our investigations delivered to your inbox with the Big Story newsletter.\n\nCreative Commons License (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0)\n\nThank you for your interest in republishing this story.

      "text": "Texts Show Kimberly Guilfoyle Bragged About Raising Millions for Rally That Fueled Capitol Riot\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nKimberly Guilfoyle, a top fundraiser for former President Donald Trump and the girlfriend of his son Donald Trump Jr., boasted to a GOP operative that she had raised $3 million for the rally that helped fuel the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.\n\nIn a series of text messages sent on Jan. 4 to Katrina Pierson, the White House liaison to the event, Guilfoyle detailed her fundraising efforts and supported a push to get far-right speakers on the stage alongside Trump for the rally, which sought to overturn the election of President Joe Biden.\n\nGuilfoyle's texts, reviewed by ProPublica, represent the strongest indication yet that members of the Trump family circle were directly involved in the financing and organization of the rally. The attack on the Capitol that followed it left five dead and scores injured.\n\nA House select committee investigating the events of Jan. 6 has subpoenaed more than 30 Trump allies for testimony and documents, including Pierson and Caroline Wren, a former deputy to Guilfoyle. But Guilfoyle herself has so far not received any official scrutiny from Congress.\n\nGuilfoyle's attorney, Joe Tacopina, denied that Guilfoyle had anything to do with fundraising or approving speakers. He said the text from Guilfoyle \"did not relate to the Save America rally\" on Jan. 6 and the \"content of the message itself\" was \"inaccurate\" and \"taken out of context.\" He did not respond to additional questions asking about the accuracy and context of the message.\n\nReached by phone, Pierson declined to comment.\n\nThe text messages show that Guilfoyle expressed specific concerns that she might not be allowed to speak on stage at the Jan. 6 rally. Pierson responded that Trump himself set the speaking lineup and that it was limited to people he selected, including some of his children and Amy Kremer, a grassroots activist who organized the event.\n\nGuilfoyle replied that she only wanted to introduce Trump Jr. and had \"raised so much money for this.\"\n\n\"Literally one of my donors Julie at 3 million,\" she added.\n\nGuilfoyle was referring to Julie Jenkins Fancelli, a Publix supermarket heir who Guilfoyle had developed a professional relationship with during the campaign.\n\nUntil now, Wren has been the only person identified as having worked with Fancelli. As ProPublica reported last month, Wren also boasted in private conversations with colleagues of raising $3 million for the events of Jan. 6.\n\nIt remains unclear whether that amount was really raised and, if so, how the majority of it was spent. Some of the money raised from Fancelli flowed to dark money groups that supported the rally, according to wire transfers described to ProPublica, planning documents and interviews with insiders.\n\nIn a statement from her attorney, Wren acknowledged helping to produce the rally but did not provide further details about her role in fundraising.\n\n\"To Ms. Wren's knowledge, Kimberly Guilfoyle had no involvement in raising funds for any events on January 6th,\" the statement said. \"They were both present at a peaceful rally with hundreds of thousands of Americans who were in DC to lawfully exercise their first amendment rights, a primary pillar of American democracy.\"\n\nThe texts between Guilfoyle and Pierson and interviews with Trump officials also suggest that Guilfoyle attempted to influence the lineup of speakers scheduled to appear at the event.\n\nOn the night of Jan. 5, Trump Jr., Guilfoyle and Wren attended an event at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, where Trump donors mingled with prominent figures in the movement to overturn the election, according to interviews and social media posts from attendees.\n\nAround the time of that event, Wren called rally staff and urged them to allow speaking roles for Ali Alexander, a far-right provocateur and leader of the Stop the Steal movement; Roger Stone, a former Trump advisor; and conspiracy theorist and InfoWars leader Alex Jones, according to a former campaign official who was told details of the call by people who listened to it.\n\nTrump aides had already deemed the men too radical to go on stage, worrying they might embarrass the president.\n\nDuring the call, Guilfoyle voiced her support for the controversial speakers, the former campaign official was told. She also specifically demanded that Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who had sued to challenge election results in four other states, address the crowd. Alexander later said on a newscast that he also received a call from Guilfoyle that same evening.\n\nTacopina, Guilfoyle's lawyer, said she did not urge staffers to change the speakers. \"Your contention that Ms. Guilfoyle approved a speaking list for January 6th is patently false,\" he wrote. He threatened to \"aggressively pursue all legal remedies available\" against ProPublica.\n\nBut the texts show Guilfoyle and Pierson talking about a \"leaked\" speaking list - an apparent reference to an article about the Jan. 6 rally published by the conservative news website Breitbart the day before.\n\nThat list included Alexander, Stone and Paxton, among others.\n\n\"All I know is that someone leaked a list of 'speakers' that the WH had not seen or approved,\" Pierson wrote. \"I've never had so much interference.\"\n\nGuilfoyle responded: \"Yea and this the list we approved.\"\n\nTacopina did not answer further questions about what Guilfoyle meant in the text where she said \"we\" had approved a speaking list.\n\nUntangling the relationship between Guilfoyle, Wren and Fancelli is key to understanding the financing of the events of Jan. 6.\n\nIn January 2020, Guilfoyle was appointed national chair of the Trump Victory finance committee, a leading fundraising vehicle for Trump's reelection campaign. She brought Wren on as her deputy.\n\nGuilfoyle, through her relationship with Trump Jr., had access to the family and a certain star power that appealed to donors. Wren, by all accounts a relentless, high-energy worker, brought fundraising expertise and a Rolodex of wealthy Republicans willing to invest handsomely to keep Trump in office. The duo ultimately brought in tens of millions of dollars toward Trump's reelection.\n\nThe pair focused primarily on ramping up the campaign's \"bundling\" program, a method of fundraising that relies on volunteers collecting money from their personal networks.\n\nFancelli, a reclusive member of one of the country's richest families , was one of those volunteers, according to interviews and internal Trump Victory records. Splitting her time between Florida and Italy, Fancelli raised at least $72,000 from her friends and family.\n\nShe stood out to Wren and Guilfoyle, who in 2020 considered her for a role as Florida state co-chair for the bundling program, according to an internal Trump Victory planning document reviewed by ProPublica. The document highlighted Fancelli as a person Guilfoyle should contact personally.\n\nTacopina said Guilfoyle had never seen any such document \"nor is aware of its supposed existence.\"\n\nOn or just before July 14, 2020, Guilfoyle called Fancelli directly, according to a different set of  text messages reviewed by ProPublica. The next day, Fancelli made her largest federal political contribution to date, according to campaign finance records: $250,000 to Trump Victory.\n\nBy election night, she had chipped in $565,000 more, records show.\n\nTacopina did not address the July 2020 phone call in his statement and did not respond to questions about Guilfoyle's relationship with Fancelli. Fancelli did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAfter the election, Wren became the main fundraising consultant for a newly formed super PAC run by two of Trump Jr.'s closest aides. The super PAC, called \"Save the US Senate PAC,\" placed ads starring Trump Jr. in which he encouraged Georgians to vote Republican in the bitterly contested runoff elections that would result in Democratic control of the Senate.\n\nThat PAC was primarily funded by LJ Management Services Inc., a company closely linked to Fancelli's family foundation. It gave $800,000 to the PAC in several installments, records show.\n\nIn late December, Wren became involved in the rally preparations for Jan. 6.\n\nWren told multiple organizers interviewed by ProPublica that she was carrying out the wishes of the Trump family. Some believed her and feared that defying her would upset the Trumps. Others suspected she was exaggerating.\n\n\"Caroline kept talking about her connections to Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle,\" said Cindy Chafian, a rally organizer who told ProPublica she was put in touch with Wren and Fancelli by Alex Jones. \"I thought she was full of crap.\"\n\nAs ProPublica previously reported , Wren told Dustin Stockton, another rally organizer, that she had raised $3 million for Jan. 6 and \"parked\" funds with three Republican dark money groups supporting the rally.\n\nIn one case, Wren routed roughly $150,000 from Fancelli to the Republican Attorneys General Association's Rule of Law Defense Fund, which then purchased a robocall instructing Trump supporters to come to Washington and march on the Capitol after the president's speech. The robocall was purchased in order to satisfy the conditions of the donation, a person familiar with the transaction told ProPublica.\n\nProPublica also reported that Wren had pressured rally organizers to allow Jones and other far-right leaders to speak on stage before the president. The effort grew so intense and volatile that on the morning of Jan. 6, a senior White House official suggested rally organizers call the U.S. Park Police on Wren to have her escorted off the Ellipse. Officers arrived but took no action. Wren has previously declined to comment on the incident.\n\nAround the same time, Guilfoyle sat with Trump and other members of his inner circle in the Oval Office and discussed the growing throngs outside, according to The Washington Post. \"They're just reflecting the will of the people,\" she reportedly told the president. \"This is the will of the people.\"\n\nOn stage later that morning, Guilfoyle gave a rousing speech introducing Trump Jr. \"We will not allow the liberals and the Democrats to steal our dream or steal our elections,\" Guilfoyle told the crowd.\n\nTrump Jr. then exhorted the crowd to send a message to the Republican members of Congress who \"did nothing to stop the steal.\"\n\nTrump Jr. did not respond to an emailed request for comment.\n\nJones and Alexander left the rally early. Wren escorted the men away from the White House as they prepared to lead the march on the Capitol.\n\nAs the Capitol plunged into chaos later that day - police officers outnumbered and overrun, lawmakers huddled behind makeshift bunkers, tear gas enshrouding the building - Guilfoyle boarded a private jet.\n\nRead More\n\nShe was off to Florida with at least two major Trump donors, Nebraska gubernatorial candidate Charles Herbster and California entrepreneur Richard Kofoed, who had chartered the jet. The plane left Dulles International Airport at 3:47 p.m., according to aviation records. It dropped Herbster off on Florida's Amelia Island before heading for West Palm Beach. Wren listed both Kofoed and Herbster as her VIPs for the rally in planning documents. Planning documents show Cassidy Kofoed, Richard Kofoed's 23-year-old daughter, also worked with Wren on preparations for Jan. 6.\n\nHerbster confirmed that he was on board the plane with Guilfoyle. Richard and Cassidy Kofoed did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn response to questions about the flight, Tacopina said that Guilfoyle lived with Kofoed and his wife at a rented property in Mar-a-Lago from approximately December 2020 through July 2021.\n\nGuilfoyle has continued her role as a major Trump fundraiser. In October, she was put at the helm of Trump's super PAC, called Make America Great Again, Again!\n\nDo You Have a Tip for ProPublica? Help Us Do Journalism.\n\nGot a story we should hear?

      "text": "ProPublica logo\n\nA top Federal Election Commission official, whose division regulates campaign cash, has shown support for President Trump and has close ties to his 2016 campaign attorney, Don McGahn. Experts said the actions raise questions about impartiality.\n\nby Mike Spies and Jake Pearson\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nDebbie Chacona oversees the division of the Federal Election Commission that serves as the first line of defense against illegal flows of cash in political campaigns. Its dozens of analysts sift through billions of dollars of reported contributions and expenditures, searching for any that violate the law. The work of Chacona, a civil servant, is guided by a strict ethics code and long-standing norms that employees avoid any public actions that might suggest partisan leanings.\n\nBut Chacona's open support of President Donald Trump and her close ties to a former Republican FEC commissioner, Donald McGahn, who went on to become the 2016 Trump campaign's top lawyer, have raised questions among agency employees and prompted at least one formal complaint. Chacona, a veteran agency staffer who has run the FEC's Reports Analysis Division, or RAD, since 2010, has made her partisan allegiance clear in a series of public Facebook posts that include a photo of her family gathered around a \"Make America Great Again\" sign while attending Trump's January 2017 inauguration.\n\nSubscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\nThe public display of partisanship bewildered some FEC staffers, according to a former agency employee. For decades, the agency expressly banned employees from engaging in such partisanship, a cultural ethos that has stuck even after those rules were relaxed in 2011. Chacona's duties included discerning whether the inaugural committee's disclosures of donor information appeared to contain any \"serious violations\" of the law, an FEC procedures manual states.\n\nTyler Culberson, who worked under Chacona as a senior campaign finance analyst from 2010 to 2015, told ProPublica that staffers were trained to never betray political preferences that could call into question their division's \"neutrality.\"\n\n\"Any public display of support or opposition to any candidate, campaign, anything on the federal level - we didn't do it,\" Culberson said. \"When you are regulating partisan committees, the display of partisanship suggests the possibility of preferential treatment to that committee or candidate. So the mere appearance of it is problematic.\"\n\nThe inaugural committee, a nonprofit distinct from Trump's presidential campaign, filed its initial 510-page report in April 2017, detailing a record-breaking $107 million raised from more than 1,000 contributors. Within two weeks , a news story and then a watchdog complaint filed with the FEC highlighted a host of misidentified and shady donations. Several months later, when the committee amended its filing to address the issues, Chacona ultimately signed off on it, records show. But the updated report continues to list donors whose addresses don't exist in public records. The committee has had other problems too: State prosecutors have accused it of spending lavishly on Trump properties , and federal investigators subpoenaed the nonprofit for donor records in an effort to track down any illegal contributions made by foreign nationals.\n\nSeparately, emails and other records obtained by ProPublica show Chacona had frequent, friendly interactions on matters professional and personal with McGahn. The two worked together at the agency from 2008 through September 2013, when McGahn briefly entered private practice then went to work in 2015 as counsel for Trump's presidential campaign. After the election, he served as White House counsel.\n\nChacona did not respond to requests for comment. McGahn said, \"I don't comment on nonsense.\"\n\nOver the course of McGahn's FEC tenure, concerns over his ties with Chacona were relayed through official agency channels: at least one colleague complained directly to Chacona's supervisor that her closeness to the attorney could undermine the agency's nonpartisan credibility, and the relationship was the backdrop for a 2011 inspector general report that was shared with commissioners.\n\nThe emails between Chacona and McGahn , obtained by ProPublica through the Freedom of Information Act, show that Chacona sought McGahn's advice on fine points of campaign finance law and regulation, and engaged in derogatory exchanges about Ellen Weintraub, a Democratic FEC commissioner, and Fred Wertheimer, one of the country's leading advocates for campaign finance reform. Democracy 21, Wertheimer's nonprofit, helped file the FEC complaint against Trump's inaugural committee.\n\nLarry Noble, a former FEC general counsel who served in Republican and Democratic administrations, told ProPublica that an official in Chacona's position must be \"fair\" to all commissioners, and that expressing negative views to a commissioner about someone with business before the agency \"raises questions about whether the person will get a fair shake.\"\n\nNoble added that, overall, it's \"inappropriate for the head of a division to have such a relationship with just one commissioner. It makes you wonder in what ways she's steered RAD toward that ideological view in both subtle and obvious ways - what kind of things the division went after, and what kinds of things it didn't.\"\n\nChacona's division provides the public's only window into how money is spent and raised on elections. She manages a staff of 70 employees, a portion of whom flag irregular contributions and potential spending violations that can prompt audits, civil penalties and, in rare cases, criminal prosecutions.\n\nCulberson said that Chacona is \"ultimately the one who will say, 'We're not going to question this; we are going to question this.' There is a level of putting her finger on the scale if she wanted to.\"\n\nIt is unclear whether the Trump campaign has received favorable treatment from Chacona. The FEC declined to address detailed questions from ProPublica, including whether Chacona and McGahn communicated about campaign finance issues during the 2016 election cycle, interactions that would introduce the prospect of favoritism.\n\nAnn Ravel, a Democrat who served on the commission, said Chacona's show of support for the president and the emails detailing her consultations with McGahn warrant an internal investigation to determine if there was any wrongdoing.\n\n\"You assume everything Debbie is saying is based solely on her expertise and knowledge,\" she said. \"At the very least, she should never, at any point, be involved in any decisions relating to Trump.\"\n\nChacona's contacts with McGahn may have run afoul of a government ethics regulation meant to address circumstances in which close relationships can call into question an employee's decision-making, said Kathleen Clark, a government ethics expert at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis. That rule requires that employees get approval from a designated agency official in cases where a \"reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts\" might question the federal employee's \"impartiality.\"\n\nMcGahn is not involved in the president's 2020 campaign, according to Tim Murtaugh, the campaign's communications director. He is now a partner at Jones Day, a Washington, D.C., law firm that has been paid millions of dollars this cycle by the campaign.\n\nMurtaugh declined to say whether the campaign was aware of McGahn and Chacona's relationship in 2016, if the two were in touch over disclosure filings that year or if the campaign is in communication with Chacona now.\n\nThe tenure of McGahn, appointed to the FEC by President George W. Bush, was punctuated by discord between Republican and Democratic commissioners. Known as pugnacious and relentlessly partisan, McGahn led the agency's GOP wing as it regularly pushed back on campaign finance regulation. Votes on possible violations often resulted in a 3-3 deadlock as commissioners split along party lines, a lasting legacy that has earned him the reputation as one of the panel's most influential members of all time.\n\nThe acrimonious dynamic was exacerbated by the Supreme Court's controversial 2010 Citizens United decision, which laid the foundation for removing essentially all limits on corporate and nonprofit election spending, as well as lifting restrictions on individual contributions to political action committees.\n\nAs elections were flooded with far more money than ever before, the importance of Chacona's division grew.\n\nIn this uncharted regulatory terrain, she looked to McGahn for guidance.\n\n\"Wondering if a Super PAC that contributes to another Super PAC is still held to the contribution limit,\" Chacona asked McGahn in the summer of 2012, her email including a smiley face. \"Your thoughts please.\"\n\n\"No limit,\" he responded.\n\nPart of the exchange is redacted, so it's unclear where Chacona landed on the matter, but in her final response to him she said that \"I even thought of some of what you said on my own (probably from reading all of your stuff over the years).\"\n\nThe trove of emails shows that she shared McGahn's negative view of those who saw Citizens United as a potential danger to democracy.\n\nIn early 2010, Chacona and McGahn privately mocked Wertheimer, whose watchdog group, Democracy 21, often files FEC complaints. In a press release, Wertheimer contended that the Citizens United decision was \"out of touch with the American people.\"\n\nChacona forwarded the quote to McGahn, wondering if Wertheimer \"ever talked with anyone outside the beltway about this stuff,\" because, she said, \"they pretty much don't have a clue.\" Chacona concluded, \"Sounds like he's the one out of touch,\" ending the sentence with another smiley face.\n\nMcGahn replied that Wertheimer has \"zero intellectual honesty, and will say anything about anyone.\"\n\nThe contempt extended to Weintraub. In one 2011 exchange, the two discussed a Politico article that quoted Weintraub as saying she considered the Republican panelists \"colleagues\" and \"not pals,\" prompting Chacona to ask, with her customary smiley face, \"How broken up are you that Ellen doesn't consider you a pal?\"\n\nChacona told McGahn, who was quoted in the story deriding \"superficial compromise,\" that he came across as \"sensible and sincere.\"\n\nMcGahn responded that to Weintraub a deadlocked commission vote is \"a failure to give guidance, but [to] everyone else, it's a green light.\"\n\nA year later, early in what would become a more than $2 billion presidential contest between Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama - then the most expensive race in American history - Chacona and McGahn were critical of journalists scrutinizing FEC disclosure reports. She wrote to him decrying a \"media frenzy\" over the issue. McGahn characterized the intense interest as \"disclosuremania.\"\n\nThe emails show Chacona held McGahn in high regard. \"As usual, you schooled me,\" she wrote in one exchange about the Supreme Court and campaign finance. In an email about disclosure rules, she told him, \"I should know by now you are always a step (or 2, 3, 4...) ahead.\"\n\nChacona's closeness to McGahn prompted at least one top FEC official to complain to Chacona's supervisor, Patricia Orrock, about the appearance of a potential conflict of interest that could jeopardize the agency's integrity.\n\nLynn Fraser, who retired in May 2017 as the head of the FEC's Alternative Dispute Resolution program, told ProPublica that she was troubled by interactions between the RAD official and the commissioner, which she described as \"a bit too cozy.\"\n\nFraser said she spoke up because the appearance that the head of RAD had a personal or political bias for McGahn, a staunch Republican, could hurt the division's promise of neutrality and might unintentionally influence RAD analysts worried about challenging a boss with a clear point of view.\n\n\"Conflicts of interest are tricky little things because sometimes people don't even realize they have a conflict, they don't perceive it as such,\" Fraser added. \"And that's actually more dangerous. It can color your worldview without you even being really aware of it. And Don was persuasive. He's really smart. And he knows campaign finance.\"\n\nIn a closed door meeting, while McGahn was still a commissioner, Fraser said she asked Orrock to explain to Chacona that her relationship with the commissioner \"looks really bad.\"\n\n\"It's the appearance of impropriety that starts raising peoples' concerns,\" Fraser said she remembers telling Orrock, who remains Chacona's supervisor. \"I got the assumption, and that's all it was, that she would say something to Debbie.\"\n\nIt's not clear whether Orrock, who did not respond to a request for comment, ever talked with Chacona.\n\nFraser's concerns did not come in a vacuum. In 2011, Chacona's husband, Marcus, lodged a complaint with the FEC's inspector general. The complaint included allegations that he had received anonymous calls relating to his wife and McGahn.\n\n\"The nature of this contact is to apparently alert me about the nature of their relationship and they expressed that it is more than professional,\" he wrote.\n\nThe resulting report , which was shared with commissioners, was unable to determine who was behind the calls because Marcus Chacona, who declined to comment, stopped cooperating and refused to turn over his phone records.\n\nAlmost as soon as Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20, 2017, reporters noted the crowd size at the event was smaller than it was for Obama's first inauguration in 2009. The accurate assessment touched off days of blustery pushback from the White House, which took on the media over its inaugural coverage. Chacona posted an image on Facebook of the event showing a packed crowd on the National Mall. \"Here's a real picture from yesterday,\" she wrote.\n\nBut while the dispute played out publicly, more significant problems faced the 58th Presidential Inaugural Committee.\n\nThe nonprofit group had raised more than double what Obama's inaugural committee collected in 2009, and the FEC required it to account for its donors. When Trump's committee filed its initial FEC disclosure form in April 2017, the Huffington Post created a public spreadsheet to crowdsource its effort to vet the names, companies and addresses.\n\nWithin days, the news outlet detailed hundreds of reporting mistakes, such as obscuring the true buyer of inaugural tickets and disclosing inaccurate donor addresses.\n\nA week after the story was published, Wertheimer's Democracy 21 and other watchdog groups filed a formal FEC complaint , arguing that inaugural officials had recklessly filed reports \"they knew or should have known did not include required information.\"\n\nTrump's committee amended its filing to address some problems and asserted that the complaint raised mostly \"technical reporting issues\" and should be dismissed. To support its argument, the committee noted that RAD had sent both of Obama's inaugural committees formal requests for more information - inquiries the Obama committees satisfied by amending their filings.\n\nThe FEC general counsel sided with Trump's committee in an October 2017 report and recommended the commission dismiss the complaint. While acknowledging that \"we do not know the full extent of the Inaugural Committee's inaccurate reporting,\" the report concluded that the Trump committee had made \"analogous errors\" to those of Obama. \"We do not believe it is an efficient use of Commission resources to pursue this matter,\" it said.\n\nIn a footnote, the report explicitly states that Chacona had \"discretion\" over the Trump committee's amended report, and that RAD chose not to formally request more information.\n\nPotential funding cuts for NOAA and its research partners threaten irreparable harm not only to climate research but to American safety, competitiveness, and national security.\n\nYears later, the Trump inaugural has still not resolved all of its reporting problems, and the committee continues to list donors with questionable addresses, according to an examination by CNBC. One $25,000 donation, for example, came from a Singapore address that does not appear in public records. It is illegal for an inaugural to accept donations from a foreign national, but in its report, the Trump committee asserted that the donor was an American citizen. An additional $100,000 came from a contributor whose Anaheim, California, address also could not be verified. Both discrepancies were confirmed by ProPublica.\n\nAn inaugural committee spokesman said that if \"additional corrections\" to its report \"are ever required, they will be addressed.\" He also said that McGahn played no role in responding to Democracy 21's complaint.\n\nWertheimer, who had been ridiculed by McGahn and Chacona years earlier, told ProPublica that he \"can't see any reasonable explanation\" for why RAD hasn't asked the inaugural committee to resolve these discrepancies.

      "text": "Inspector General Urges Ethics Review at Federal Election Commission Following ProPublica Report\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nThe inspector general for the Federal Election Commission is calling on the agency to review its ethics policies and internal controls after a ProPublica investigation last year revealed that a senior manager openly supported Donald Trump and maintained a close relationship with a Republican attorney who went on to serve as the 2016 Trump campaign's top lawyer.\n\nThe report by ProPublica raised questions about the impartiality of the FEC official, Debbie Chacona, a civil servant who oversees the unit responsible for keeping unlawful contributions out of U.S. political campaigns. The division's staffers are supposed to adhere to a strict ethics code and forgo any public partisan activities because such actions could imply preferential treatment for a candidate or party and jeopardize the commission's credibility.\n\nIn its findings , the inspector general said Chacona, head of the FEC's Reports Analysis Division, or RAD, did not improperly intervene in a review of the Trump inaugural committee's fundraising and acted \"consistent with relevant law and policy\" by allowing career analysts to handle the filings.\n\nBut the inspector general said \"it is important to address the ethical principle that federal employees should avoid even the appearance of impropriety.\" It added that the FEC's \"unique mission raises heightened concerns when allegations of personal or political bias are raised against FEC senior personnel that could undermine the public's confidence in the agency\" and recommended the commission \"evaluate the current agency policies on ethical behavior and update them, as may be appropriate.\"\n\nChacona displayed her support for Trump in Facebook posts, including one in which she posed with her family around a \"Make America Great Again\" sign at Trump's January 2017 inaugural. Separately, emails obtained by ProPublica showed that she also consulted regularly on matters personal and professional with the Republican lawyer, Donald McGahn, when he was an FEC commissioner from 2008 to September 2013.\n\nAfter Trump's election, the fundraising practices of his inaugural committee prompted complaints that the FEC failed to properly examine contributions. As head of RAD, Chacona signed off on amended filings by the committee intended to address some of those complaints even though the revised reports continued to list problematic donations, including ones from donors whose addresses didn't exist in public records.\n\nThe 300-employee FEC is an independent regulatory agency that was created by Congress to enforce campaign finance law. It is headed by six presidentially appointed commissioners, four of whom must vote together for the agency to take any official action, a requirement that was meant to bolster nonpartisan compromise but has resulted in chronic gridlock.\n\nThe inspector general also took issue with the way the FEC regulates presidential inaugural committees, which are nonprofit entities separate from campaign committees. Trump's inaugural committee raised a record-breaking $107 million from more than 1,000 contributors. Its initial disclosure report was 510 pages.\n\nThe inspector general found that unlike with campaign committees, FEC policy confers \"broad, subjective discretion to the RAD senior manager to determine what potential violations of law warrant further inquiry\" when it comes to inaugural committees. It called such a standard \"ill-defined and subjective,\" cautioning that it could create \"a reasonable likelihood of inconsistent results and arbitrary or capricious application (in fact or appearance).\"\n\nThe inspector general also said that unlike political committees, which file their reports to the FEC electronically, inaugural committee disclosure reports are filed on paper to the commission and then manually reviewed by agency staffers - a system the inspector general said was \"antiquated and lacks adequate internal controls.\"\n\nAsked what the agency has done to address the appearance of a conflict of interest at RAD and whether the agency planned on adopting any of the inspector general recommendations, an FEC spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nMcGahn, who was appointed White House counsel after serving as the Trump campaign's top lawyer, now heads the government regulations group at the law firm Jones Day. He did not respond to messages seeking comment; in a response for the earlier ProPublica story, he said he doesn't comment on \"nonsense.\" Chacona did not respond to a message seeking comment. A spokesperson for Trump's inaugural committee didn't return a message seeking comment.\n\nThe inspector general said that it interviewed FEC lawyers and RAD staffers, and that it obtained and reviewed agency records to conduct its inquiry. Commissioners were notified of the investigators' findings at the end of July.\n\nWith its unprecedented haul and its questionable outlays, Trump's inaugural committee drew swift attention from journalists and regulators. The Washington, D.C., attorney general has sued the committee, accusing it of enriching the Trump family business by spending lavishly at Trump-owned properties, claims the committee has denied in court papers. Separately, federal prosecutors subpoenaed the committee's donor records as part of an inquiry into illegal contributions made by foreign nationals.\n\nRead More\n\nBoth inaugural and political committees are prohibited from accepting contributions from foreign nationals. But Trump's inaugural committee included in its disclosure reports donations from contributors outside the U.S., and RAD relied on the word of the committee that the donors were indeed U.S. citizens, the inspector general report found. Investigators took issue with that practice. They noted that RAD's policy of accepting a committee's \"self-certification\" wasn't memorialized in any policy, and they recommended that the division set a threshold when such a contribution would trigger further inquiry to independently verify the source of the money.\n\nFred Wertheimer, whose advocacy group Democracy 21 helped file a 2017 FEC complaint against Trump's inaugural committee, which the agency's general counsel later dismissed , said the head of RAD should have recused herself from overseeing the committee's filings.\n\n\"In my view Ms. Chacona had a clear appearance of conflict and never should've gone anywhere near the inaugural committee's report,\" said Wertheimer, who was derided by Chacona and McGahn in the email exchanges obtained by ProPublica.\n\nFiled under -\n\nI'm an investigative reporter covering the intersection of business and government.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

Thompson , ProPublica, Ali Winston and Darwin BondGraham for ProPublica\n\nTracking Hate Crimes and Bias Incidents\n\nIt was about 10 a.m. on Aug. 12 when the melee erupted just north of Emancipation Park in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nAbout two dozen white supremacists - many equipped with helmets and wooden shields - were battling with a handful of counter-protesters, most of them African American. One white man dove into the violence with particular zeal. Using his fists and feet, the man attacked one person after another.\n\nThe street fighter was in Virginia on that August morning for the \"Unite the Right\" rally, the largest public gathering of white supremacists in a generation, a chaotic and bloody event that would culminate, a few hours later, in the killing of 32-year-old Heather Heyer, who was there to protest the racist rally.\n\nThe violence in Charlottesville became national news. President Donald Trump's response to it - he asserted there were \"some very fine people on both sides\" of the events that day - set off a wave of condemnations, from his allies as well as his critics.\n\nBut for many Americans, conservatives as well as liberals, there was shock and confusion at the sight of bands of white men bearing torches, chanting racist slogans and embracing the heroes of the Confederacy: Who were they? What are their numbers and aims?\n\nThere is, of course, no single answer. Some who were there that weekend in Charlottesville are hardened racists involved with long-running organizations like the League of the South. Many are fresh converts to white supremacist organizing, young people attracted to nativist and anti-Muslim ideas circulated on social media by leaders of the so-called alt-right, the newest branch of the white power movement. Some are paranoid characters thrilled to traffic in the symbols and coded language of vast global conspiracy theories. Others are sophisticated provocateurs who see the current political moment as a chance to push a \"white agenda,\" with angry positions on immigration, diversity and economic isolationism.\n\nProPublica spent weeks examining one distinctive group at the center of the violence in Charlottesville: an organization called the Rise Above Movement, one of whose members was the white man dispensing beatings near Emancipation Park Aug. 12.\n\nThe group, based in Southern California, claims more than 50 members and a singular purpose: physically attacking its ideological foes. RAM's members spend weekends training in boxing and other martial arts, and they have boasted publicly of their violence during protests in Huntington Beach, San Bernardino and Berkeley. Many of the altercations have been captured on video, and its members are not hard to spot.\n\nIndeed, ProPublica has identified the group's core members and interviewed one of its leaders at length. The man in the Charlottesville attacks - filmed by a documentary crew working with ProPublica - is 24-year-old Ben Daley, who runs a Southern California tree-trimming business.\n\nMany of the organization's core members, including Daley, have serious criminal histories, according to interviews and a review of court records. Before joining RAM, several members spent time in jail or state prison on serious felony charges including assault, robbery, and gun and knife offenses. Daley did seven days in jail for carrying a concealed snub-nosed revolver. Another RAM member served a prison term for stabbing a Latino man five times in a 2009 gang assault.\n\n\"Fundamentally, RAM operates like an alt-right street-fighting club,\" said Oren Segal, director of the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism.\n\nDespite their prior records, and open boasting of current violence, RAM has seemingly drawn little notice from law enforcement. Four episodes of violence documented by ProPublica resulted in only a single arrest - and in that case prosecutors declined to go forward. Law enforcement officials in the four cities - Charlottesville, Huntington Beach, San Bernardino and Berkeley - either would not comment about RAM or said they had too little evidence or too few resources to seriously investigate the group's members.\n\nIn Virginia, two months after the deadly events in Charlottesville, Corinne Geller, a spokeswoman for the Virginia State Police, would not say if the police had identified RAM as a dangerous group.\n\n\"We're not going to be releasing the names of the groups that we believe were present that day in Charlottesville,\" she said. Investigators, she added, are still \"reviewing footage\" from the event.\n\nLaw enforcement has a mixed record when it comes to anticipating and confronting the challenge of white supremacist violence.\n\nOften working undercover at great personal risk, federal investigators have successfully disrupted dozens of racist terror attacks. In the last year, agents have captured three Kansas men planning to bomb a mosque and an apartment complex inhabited largely by Somali immigrants, arrested a white supremacist in South Carolina as he plotted a \"big scale\" attack, and investigated a neo-Nazi cell that allegedly intended to blow up a nuclear power plant.\n\nBut there have also been failures. During the past five years, white supremacists, some of them members of gangs or organized political groups, have murdered at least 22 people, according to the Global Terrorism Database and news reports. And some government insiders say the intelligence services and federal law enforcement agencies have largely shifted their attention away from far-right threats in the years since 9/11, choosing instead to focus heavily on Islamic radicals, who are seen by some to pose a more immediate danger.\n\nState and local police have struggled to respond effectively to the recent resurgence in racist political organizing. Police in Sacramento were caught unprepared in June 2016 when neo-Nazis and anti-fascist counter-protesters, or \"antifa,\" armed with knives and improvised weapons, clashed outside the California State Capitol during a rally. Ten people were sent to the hospital with stab wounds.\n\nTaking a different tack, Gov. Rick Scott of Florida took the aggressive step of declaring a state of emergency in the run-up to this week's appearance by Richard Spencer, a white supremacist scheduled to speak in Gainesville.\n\nMichael German is a former FBI agent who during his career infiltrated a Nazi skinhead gang and militia organizations. German, now a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, said he is worried that law enforcement doesn't comprehend the threat posed by this latest iteration of the white supremacist movement.\n\nPolice and federal agents, in his view, are \"looking at this whole thing so narrowly, as two groups clashing at a protest.\"\n\nIn reality, German said, \"it is organized criminal activity.\"\n\nOne of the first people known to have been targeted by RAM was a journalist working for OC Weekly, an irreverent liberal publication based in Orange County, California.\n\nThe date was March 25, and writer Frank John Tristan was covering a Make America Great Again rally in Huntington Beach. The event, which had drawn more than 2,000 Trump supporters, marked what seems to have been RAM's public debut. About a dozen RAM fighters showed up, with members carrying an anti-Semitic sign and a massive banner emblazoned with the words \"Defend America.\"\n\nThe march also drew a small contingent of anti-Trump protesters, including some militant antifa activists, and some people intent on physically blocking the procession as it moved along the Pacific Coast Highway. Before long, the scene turned violent and brawls between the political foes swept across the beach.\n\nTristan and two OC Weekly colleagues, photographers Julie Leopo and Brian Feinzimer, wound up in the conflict.\n\n\"The Trump supporters felt empowered to ridicule and intimidate me,\" Leopo recalled in an OC Weekly article . \"I kept shooting despite the insults and just as I was about to click the shutter on my camera, I looked up and locked eyes with a white woman carrying a flag.\"\n\nThe woman struck Leopo and Feinzimer with the flagpole. A man shoved Feinzimer, sending him reeling. Tristan intervened, trying to calm the situation.\n\nThat's when two men attacked him. One was a RAM member who charged at Tristan and began punching him in the face. The other assailant, who wasn't a RAM fighter, grabbed Tristan's sweatshirt and hit him with a series of punches.\n\nTristan was staggered. Someone standing nearby fired off a thick stream of pepper spray, and Tristan's beating ended. Then RAM members fanned out and began fighting with other people.\n\nAnother RAM member confronted a masked counter-protester, grabbed the man, and threw him into the sand. From there he pummeled the counter-protester with his fist and elbow. Captured on video and shared through social media, the spectacle became a meme of the so-called alt-right.\n\nIn the days after the mayhem, Tristan spent hours studying shaky smartphone videos and scrolling through social media posts trying to identify the men who attacked him. He concluded that a 21-year-old man named Tyler Laube was the RAM member who struck him. Laube appears with his face uncovered in several group photographs of RAM from their training sessions in an Orange County park and at the Huntington Beach rally.\n\nProPublica was unable to contact Laube, but court records show he has had many entanglements with the law in recent years.\n\nHe has been convicted of fighting with a paramedic at a supermarket, illegally possessing a switchblade, disturbing the peace, and DUI, according to Los Angeles County court files. In 2015, Laube pleaded no contest to felony robbery charges - prosecutors said he partnered with another man to rob a 7-Eleven and another convenience store at gunpoint. While in jail before trial, Laube told a detective that he'd gone to a Hollywood strip club and gotten high on Xanax - the potent, often-abused prescription benzodiazepine - before acting as the wheelman in the robberies, which occurred early in the morning in Redondo Beach, according to court transcripts.\n\nLaube, court records indicate, was on probation on the day he allegedly assaulted Tristan.\n\nIn the six months since the violent rally, state parks police have opened no criminal case in connection with the assault on Tristan and made no arrests. It is unclear how much of the abundant photographic evidence and video footage the authorities have reviewed, if any.\n\nCapt. Kevin Pearsall, a regional superintendent with the parks police, says his officers can't act because they've received no complaint from Tristan. However, former OC Weekly editor Gustavo Arellano says he's repeatedly contacted parks police via phone and email in hopes of getting them to investigate. Parks police documents and internal emails obtained by ProPublica show that Arellano has reached out to police brass and that detectives are aware of the assault on Tristan.\n\nArellano said since the assault not a single law enforcement agency or official had contacted him about the alleged perpetrators.\n\n\"We know their identities,\" said Arellano, who supervised Tristan and the other journalists until recently, when he left the paper amid staff cuts. \"But what good is the truth when the law doesn't give a shit?\"\n\nNo charges have been brought against the people who attacked Leopo and Feinzimer, either, though Pearsall says those incidents have been examined by police. According to Pearsall, his agency, which is tasked with maintaining order in California's vast network of parks and recreational areas, doesn't have the resources to carry out extensive investigations and must turn to outside police forces for assistance in such cases.\n\nMost of the time, the young men of the Rise Above Movement, nearly all of them in their 20s, look perfectly innocuous: close-cropped hair, clean-shaven faces, T-shirts and jeans.\n\nBut for public events, RAM has developed its own menacing signature look, with members often wearing skull masks and goggles to ward off pepper spray. At times, RAM fighters have tied American flag bandannas around their faces to conceal their identities.\n\nA RAM recruiting video posted to YouTube and Vimeo highlights the organization's violent raison d'être, cutting between choppy footage of RAM members brawling at public events and carefully shot scenes of them sharpening their boxing skills and doing push-ups during group workout sessions.\n\nThere is an entire ecosystem of low-budget white supremacist media outlets - websites, blogs, forums, podcasts, YouTube channels and the like - and RAM members have been hailed as heroes on some of these platforms.\n\n\"They kicked the shit out of people in Berkeley. It was great,\" said a host on a racist podcast called Locker Room Talk. \"They like to go to rallies and beat up Communists.\" YouTube talker James Allsup saluted RAM members as the embodiment of the ideal American man.\n\nThe group portrays itself as a defense force for a Western civilization under assault by Jews, Muslims and brown-skinned immigrants from south of the Rio Grande. The RAM logo features a medieval sword with a cross on the pommel - a symbol of the crusades - and an evergreen tree. On T-shirts they wear while training, the logo appears above three words, \"courage, identity, virtue.\" At rallies, members have waved red-and-white crusader flags and carried signs saying \"Rapefugees Not Welcome\" and \"Da Goyim Know,\" an anti-Semitic slogan meant to highlight a supposed conspiracy by Jews to control the globe and subjugate non-Jews. One RAM banner, which depicts knights on horseback chasing after Muslims, reads \"Islamists Out!\"\n\nA ProPublica reporter recently met at a restaurant in Orange County with a man who says he's a leader of the organization. This man, who appears frequently in the videos of RAM members fighting, would only agree to talk openly about the group's origins and intentions if we didn't reveal his name. No other RAM members or associates would speak to us.\n\nRAM, the leader said, came together organically. It started when he encountered a few other guys with similar political beliefs, including two active duty U.S. Marines, while exercising at different gyms in Southern California. They all liked Trump but didn't think his agenda went far enough.\n\nThe men began hanging out. Their numbers grew. Many came from rough backgrounds - they'd been strung out on drugs or spent time behind bars - and currently labored at tough blue-collar jobs. Soon they had a name and a mission: They would physically take on the foes of the far-right.\n\nThe RAM leader claims his organization isn't racist and complains he doesn't even know what the word \"racism\" means.\n\n\"We're proud of our identity,\" he said before launching into a long list of grievances. Whites, he said, are ignored by politicians, taught to be ashamed by leftist academics, and marginalized and driven from the workforce by economic globalization. Young white men, he said, are drawn to the extreme right \"because there is no other option for them. They're disenfranchised.\"\n\nThis intense sense of victimization is widespread among figures involved in the so-called alt-right.\n\n\"I wouldn't say I'm a fascist,\" the RAM leader continued, though he acknowledged that his worldview is close. He said he's trying to create a \"conservative counter-culture\" as an antidote to the \"complete degeneracy\" of contemporary American life and \"the left-wing ideology that's poisoning the youth.\"\n\nIn the leader's eyes, \"your life should be dedicated to God and country and your people.\"\n\nWhile the RAM leader insists the group isn't racist, on social media channels, its members regularly espouse blatantly anti-Semitic and racist views.\n\nBen Daley has used his Facebook page to bash \"Mark Zuckerberg and his Facebook Jew police\" for taking down his \"anti Muslim posts\"; to suggest that African Americans are \"shit\" and that former President Obama is a leech; and to cheer the fatal shooting of a black man. \"Good riddance,\" he wrote. The Facebook page of another member, Robert Boman, is laden with anti-Semitic graphics, including an illustration glorifying the Nazi SS and a cartoon depicting African Americans and Muslims as rabid dogs controlled by Jews. (Court and prison records show Boman served 18 months in prison for a 2013 robbery in Torrance.)\n\nThe group has drawn recruits from the ranks of the Hammerskin Nation, the country's largest Nazi skinhead gang, which has been tied to at least nine murders in four states, including a 2012 massacre at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin.\n\nAt the ADL, Segal said law enforcement agencies are struggling to keep up with RAM and the scores of other extremist outfits that have emerged in recent years. Skillful use of social media and the broader internet has allowed some of these organizations to metastasize quickly into formidable operations. And whatever connection, if any, Trump has to their rise, the groups don't hesitate to invoke his presidency as validation for their belief systems.\n\n\"There are so many new faces,\" Segal said. \"It creates a challenge for law enforcement.\"\n\nTwo veteran Southern California detectives who spoke to ProPublica were not familiar with RAM before our reporters brought the organization to their attention. After reviewing photos and videos of RAM in action, as well the social media pages of its members, the investigators said they were concerned by what they saw. The group, they said, seems to have ties to white supremacist gangsters known to law enforcement, a propensity for violence, and a desire to grow their numbers.\n\nThe detectives spoke to ProPublica anonymously in order to freely discuss intelligence on white extremists and street gangs.\n\nEarlier this year, on April 15, about a dozen RAM members traveled from Southern California to Berkeley. The group was met there by a fan: Vincent James Foxx, a 31-year-old video blogger and livestreamer with a fondness for white supremacists and radical right-wing politics.\n\nFoxx, a father of three who runs a growing media operation called The Red Elephants, had become RAM's unofficial propagandist. After the Huntington Beach brawls, which he attended and filmed, Foxx put together a nearly 10-minute video glorifying the group's fighting abilities and uploaded it to YouTube, where it has garnered 174,000 views to date.\n\nFoxx and RAM were sure another Trump rally in one of the most liberal cities in America would provide an opportunity for violence.\n\nTwo earlier political events in Berkeley had turned ugly, with crowds of left- and right-wing activists engaging in running street battles. Police seized knives, baseball bats, axe handles, nail-studded boards and other weapons during the previous clashes. Few were predicting that the April event, scheduled for Berkeley's Civic Center Park, would be peaceful. This is what RAM had been training for.\n\nFor Foxx's part, he would be shadowing the group. He knew where the action would be.\n\nWhen leftist counter-protesters showed up to express their contempt for the president and his supporters, RAM, fighting as a pack, chased them down and attacked them - stomping, punching, kicking. Video shows Ben Daley pounding on a man who is trapped on the ground and kicking other opponents. In one incident, Daley and RAM member Robert Rundo manhandled a journalist, Shane Bauer of Mother Jones, shoving him and yelling at him \"Get the fuck out of here! ... Fake news!\"\n\nAt times RAM fought alongside an ally, Nathan Damigo, a former Marine and founder of Identity Evropa, a prominent white supremacist organization; Damigo wound up punching a female antifa member in the face, an act that would become one of the enduring images of the day's havoc.\n\nFoxx wasn't just documenting the violence at the rally - he was inciting it.  On video Foxx posted to YouTube, he can be heard repeatedly encouraging RAM members and others to assault people. \"Get that fucking cuck!\" he screamed when a RAM member and four or five other men grabbed a counter-protester and began beating him. \"Charge!\" Foxx yelled as a mob of right-wingers went on the offensive.\n\nReached via email, Foxx declined to be interviewed for this story.\n\nAt 11:45 a.m. that morning in Berkeley, police arrested Rundo, a 27-year-old boxer who lives in the beach town of San Clemente, for assaulting an officer and resisting arrest. \"Oh shit ... that's one of our guys,\" Foxx said as officers handcuffed Rundo, who was wearing a tight gray-and-black athletic shirt and a skull mask. Prosecutors would later decide not to bring charges.\n\n\"We reviewed it over the summer in July and declined to file charges,\" said Teresa Drenick, an Alameda County deputy district attorney. \"We determined we didn't have enough evidence to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n\nAnother violent incident in Rundo's past was far more clear-cut. In 2009, in Queens, New York, where Rundo had grown up, he confronted two Latino men in a store. Flanked by several other men, Rundo chased his victims into the street where one of them tripped and fell to the pavement. Prosecutors charged Rundo with pouncing on the man and stabbing him in the right hand, right elbow, left arm, chest and neck, according to court records. In a sworn statement the investigating New York Police Department detective noted that the entire episode was documented by surveillance video and that Rundo's comrades used \"some sort of club\" to bludgeon the stabbing victim and his friend.\n\nRundo, who was 19 at the time, struck a plea deal, admitting his guilt in exchange for a sentence of two years in state prison on gang assault charges. He served about 20 months of his term, prison data shows.\n\nAs a detective in the 109th Precinct, Francis Johnston helped to build the case against Rundo in 2009. Johnston, who is now retired, remembers Rundo as a hard character - \"a bit of an asshole\" - with a strong dislike for law enforcement. While police were eager to question Rundo's accomplices, they were never able to identify them - and Rundo never gave up their names.\n\nAt the Berkeley rally, RAM certainly wasn't the only violent element on the scene - antifa cadres hurled bottles and other projectiles and instigated a number of melees. But throughout the day, interviews and video show, RAM was perhaps the most effective and disciplined group as the fighting dragged on for hours. At least 11 people were injured in the violence, with seven going to local hospitals for treatment, including a stabbing victim, according to local officials.\n\n\"From the second we got there it was just chaos,\" said the RAM leader. \"People like to say we're Nazis and stuff, but all the people we've beaten up are white college kids.\"\n\nGerman, the former FBI agent now with the Brennan Center in New York, says he was shocked by the news reports he was seeing online about Berkeley. He thought: This isn't a riot. It's basically low-level political warfare in the streets of an American city . German, who studies national security and civil liberties at the Brennan Center, said he couldn't believe law enforcement was allowing the two sides to battle it out with each other for hours with minimal intervention.\n\n\"The protests in Berkeley really caught my attention,\" he said. \"This should not be happening.\"\n\nIn his view, police and federal agents should be focusing on RAM and similar organizations.\n\n\"This is black and white,\" German said. \"There are certainly people exercising First Amendment rights at these demonstrations. However, these people are in the middle of brawls and open about it - they're posting images of violence and communicating their intent to commit violence. It's very different than someone exercising their right to stand on a stage and preach their ideology.\"\n\nIn June, RAM made its way to San Bernardino for a protest by Act for America, a controversial group that urges legislators to pass bills banning Islamic sharia law in the U.S. Act for America, which says its goal is to \"protect and preserve American culture and to keep this nation safe,\" has been labeled a \"hate group\" by the Southern Poverty Law Center, which has highlighted its ties to Billy Roper, a veteran white supremacist organizer.\n\nIn San Bernardino, the RAM forces included at least two members of the Hammerskin Nation, a loosely structured but highly aggressive Nazi skinhead gang with chapters across the U.S. and in Europe.\n\nProPublica identified the men as Hammerskin members by reviewing video footage, photos, social media channels and court files.\n\n\"California has the largest racist skinhead population in the U.S., predominantly based in Southern California,\" Joanna Mendelson, a researcher at the ADL, testified at a recent California state Senate hearing. \"Adherents have their own unique subculture and are dedicated to furthering Hitlerian ideology.\"\n\nThe gangs, she noted, range from a few members to a few hundred members, and have been responsible for some of the country's \"most violent hate crimes.\"\n\nOne of the Hammerskins who has trained with RAM and appeared with them at rallies is Matthew Branstetter, a 25-year-old Huntington Beach resident. In April 2011, Branstetter and an accomplice beat a Jewish man unconscious and robbed him in an Orange County park. Branstetter was convicted of aggravated assault with a hate crime enhancement, and sent to prison for 20 months.\n\nWhile the San Bernardino march, which attracted about 300 people, was nominally a protest against sharia law, it quickly devolved into an opportunity for protesters to mock Muslims and deride their faith. One man carried a sign that said \"Islam is not an American religion.\" Another wore a shirt that said \"Muhammed was a Homo.\"\n\nDemonized as immigrants. Mistaken for Muslims. For more than a century, Sikhs in the U.S. have faced suspicion and violence.\n\nA smaller crowd of counter-protesters also turned out to condemn what they saw as racism and Islamophobia. Police tried to keep the two groups separated, corralling them on opposite sides of a street. But that didn't stop RAM, which brought about 15 members to the event. The group's members crossed the street and began beating counter-protesters, eventually running many of them off.\n\nIn a video from the scene, RAM members boast about their actions. \"We physically removed 'em,\" said Daley. \"We chased 'em down the block, smashed up their car,\" added Rundo, describing an incident in which RAM forces shattered the rear window of a car driven by counter-protesters.\n\nSan Bernardino police did not respond to requests seeking comment.\n\nRundo also said, on video, that RAM members are \"fans\" of a white supremacist slogan called the \"14 Words.\" The slogan was authored by David Lane while he was serving a 190-year sentence in federal prison for his role in the murder of Jewish talk show host Alan Berg and a series of armored car robberies that netted more than $4 million, money that Lane and his co-conspirators planned to use to fund a race war.\n\nLane wrote: \"We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.\"\n\nLane's message has been enthusiastically adopted as a call-to-arms by the current generation of right-wing radicals, many of whom believe that America's ongoing demographic transformation is rapidly pushing whites towards extinction. The only answer, they believe, is an uprising.\n\nWhat happened in Charlottesville last August looked a lot like an uprising, and RAM was right in the middle of it.\n\n\"You will not replace us! Jews will not replace us!\" yelled Daley and another RAM member, Tom Gillen, as they stood before a statue of Thomas Jefferson on the campus of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. It was the night of Aug. 11. The men held torches. They were surrounded by hundreds of young white men, all of them shouting the same words.\n\nBoth of the Californians were known to law enforcement in Los Angeles County. Gillen, a surfer and 23-year-old native of Torrance, had been jailed in 2014 for possessing an illegal handgun - someone had grinded off the serial number on the gun, making it untraceable. Police seized the weapon, destroyed it and barred Gillen from owning any other guns.\n\nGillen, like other RAM members, would not speak to ProPublica.\n\nDaley had been arrested on a gun charge that same year. He was convicted of illegally carrying a concealed snub-nose .357 Magnum revolver and sentenced to seven days in jail. Police also discovered an array of bullets in his pickup truck, including .38-caliber ammunition and .223 rifle rounds, the latter used in bolt-action hunting rifles and military-style assault weapons.\n\nIn a brief text message, Daley declined to comment on his arrest or his activities with RAM. He did, however, say that he had signed up for the U.S. military and would be going through basic training shortly.\n\nThat night in Charlottesville, Daley and Gillen clashed violently with a handful of college students who'd gathered at the Jefferson statue holding a banner denouncing racism.  RAM and the white supremacists quickly prevailed, and drove the students off the campus and into the night. Charlottesville police did little to intervene as the conflict unfolded.\n\nWhooping and giving straight-arm Nazi salutes, white supremacists began to celebrate their victory. Some chanted the words \"blood and soil,\" an old Third Reich slogan.\n\nThe violence would continue - and escalate dramatically - the next morning as racists from around the country gathered around a monument to Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee for the \"Unite the Right\" rally. And once again RAM members were at the heart of the fighting.\n\nCharlottesville police declined to comment about RAM.\n\nToday, according to the anonymous RAM leader interviewed by ProPublica, his organization is \"trying to stay away from rallies.\" RAM's next moves, he explained, are confidential.\n\nOren Segal of the ADL said RAM could prove durable or fizzle out in a matter of months. It's too soon to tell. But in both their short-term menace and their uncertain long-term future, Segal said RAM is quite representative of what he called the \"new alt-right youth brigades.\"\n\nThe self-described alt-right \"really wants to strike while the iron is hot,\" he said. \"They believe that now is the time to go from online to the real world. And frankly, the street fighting element very much fits this narrative.\"\n\nAli Winston is a reporting fellow with The Investigative Fund at The Nation Institute and covers criminal justice and surveillance.

      "text": "Trump promises âgolden ageâ in second inaugural address\n\nSign up for Semafor Americana: An insiderâs guide to American power. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nPresident Donald Trump began his second term on Monday with the promise of a new âgolden ageâ at an inauguration with public attendance restricted due to the cold â but prime seats reserved for some of the worldâs wealthiest men.\n\nTrumpâs inaugural address, delivered in the Capitol Rotunda after the ceremony moved indoors in frigid temperatures, highlighted a series of executive orders on immigration, energy and the federal government that he plans to sign immediately. But some of his most telling remarks came as he addressed a favorite topic: himself, and his stunning rise back to power.\n\nHe promised a comeback for the nation that he would lead from the perspective of being âtested and challenged moreâ than any of his predecessors.\n\nâI was saved by God to make America great again,â Trump said, bringing the crowd to its feet with a reference to last summerâs failed assassination attempt against him.\n\nFormer President Joe Biden stayed in his seat during that ovation. Biden also stayed seated as the new president detailed how heâd unwind four years of Democratic policies, declaring a ânational emergency at our Southern borderâ and an energy emergency that would include an end to electric vehicle mandates and aspects of the progressive âGreen New Deal.â\n\nAmericaâs problems, Trump said, would be âannihilatedâ by the âgreat momentumâ begun by his victory in November.\n\nAmong the campaign promises that Trump is immediately instituting are pledges to roll back LGBTQ protections and DEI initiatives. Other promises were partly fulfilled with his first set of executive orders, including a new âexternal revenue serviceâ that would collect revenue from tariffs on imported goods that he has vowed but not yet imposed.\n\nCriticizing the natural disaster response of local and federal governments in his speech, Trump said that it had even harmed some of the âwealthiest and most powerful people in our country, some of whom are sitting here right now.â\n\nIt was a conspicuous nod to the billionaires who have worked to win his favor and showed up in person on Monday, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg â and of course, Tesla CEO-turned government cost-cutting adviser Elon Musk.\n\nTrump also said he would work to end the nationâs âchronic disease epidemic,â a cause that he has adopted since former presidential rival Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. endorsed him and ultimately became his nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nRepublicans have already worked quickly to implement Trumpâs agenda, which is expected to be filled out with further executive orders in the coming days. The Senate is expected to confirm Marco Rubio as Secretary of State on Monday, but the rest of Trumpâs Cabinet will have to wait; negotiations are ongoing to approve some other national security picks.\n\nAfter the formal address, other Republicans and inaugural guests who were seated in the Capitol Visitor Center got a different, but also familiar, side of Trump â 30 minutes of remarks with no teleprompter.\n\nAfter joking that heâd given House Speaker Mike Johnson a âmajority of almost nothing,â Trump criticized the January 6 committee, repeated the false claim that the 2020 election was stolen from him, and suggested that he could have won California if voters had been required to show ID.\n\nIn this article:\n\nUnlike eight years ago, when Democrats made a show of boycotting or otherwise resisting Trumpâs inauguration, they tried to ignore this one.\n\nSome attended the peaceful transfer of power in person, hopeful that they could work with the new president on a few key issues.\n\nâI am showing up for our Constitution today and for the office, not for the man,â Vermont Rep. Becca Balint told Semafor. âIn a healthy democracy, we donât just go to the inauguration when our candidate wins.â\n\nOthers skipped it, spending Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day in their districts, and explained why on social media: âI donât celebrate rapists,â said New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nâI will not be surety to this change,â said Tennessee Rep. Steve Cohen, who said that he was watching the transition from democracy to âautocracyâ from Memphis. âMaya Angelou said when somebody shows you who they are, believe them. Trump has shown us who he is.â\n\nAnd quite a few Democrats winced as Biden greeted Trump at the White House by telling him âwelcome homeâ â a jarring show of courtesy from an outgoing president whoâd warned that Trump and his allies ârepresent extremism that threatens the very foundations of our Republic.â\n\nTrump is just the second president to win non-consecutive terms. Itâs a quirk with some surprising benefits.\n\nEight years ago, Trump inherited a country with 4.8% unemployment, low interest rates, and no inflation; he promised to âbring back jobsâ and end the âAmerican carnageâ of crime and poverty. He took the stage on Monday with unemployment at 4.1%, inflation below its post-pandemic heights, and a ceasefire in the Israel-Gaza war that dominated the last year of Bidenâs presidency. (Trump announced the deal before Biden did, though both the outgoing and incoming teams had worked on it.)\n\nSimply put, Trump got a double boost from his Democratic predecessors.\n\nIn 2017, both parties were still uncertain about how Trump would handle the job â whether its scale and power would change him, and which rally rhetoric would turn into tangible policies. This time around, he spoke more confidently, making promises directly from his campaign stump speech and the post-election period.\n\nSome of those rhetorical flourishes were the quirky stuff that has endeared Trump to his base; I donât think many Democrats woke up on Nov. 6 expecting to hear Trump talk about restoring William McKinleyâs name to the nationâs biggest mountain.\n\nBroadly speaking, neither party is wondering how Trump will treat the Oval Office. Heâs the leader of a Republican Party that has re-built its agenda around him, and the media that was so skeptical of his ambitions in the first term is more beleaguered than ever.\n\nBurgess Everett and Kadia Goba contributed.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

      "text": "Republicans revisit Trumpâs foreign policy as he pushes US power overseas\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nPresident Donald Trumpâs foreign policy is having an identity crisis: Does âAmerica Firstâ mean avoiding overseas engagements â or pursuing them when they further US interests?\n\nTrump forged an image during his 2016 run that leaned against foreign intervention, stating that he opposed the Iraq war and US involvement in Libya ( despite evidence ). His more recent vows to pursue US control of Greenland, the Panama Canal, Canada and Gaza are hinting at a geopolitical brand thatâs closer to 19th-century âmanifest destiny.â\n\nOnly a few Republicans are publicly acknowledging the tension. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., posted on X after Trumpâs proposal to take over Gaza that âI thought we voted for America First,â adding on Wednesday that âwe should not have any American presence in Gaza.â\n\nAnd one of the partyâs more iconoclastic conservatives countered that Trumpâs doctrine was never complete non-interventionism.\n\nâI think, if youâre looking toward MAGA and populism, if youâre trying to find a consistent ideology, it wonât be there,â Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., told Semafor. âTheyâre not ideologues.â\n\nRepublicans are preparing to significantly boost defense spending in Trumpâs second term, as they did during his first term. For most of them, thatâs compatible with the presidentâs stated disinterest in military commitments â as is Trumpâs pursuit of greater US power overseas, to benefit national and economic security.\n\nTrump âtakes great pride in the fact that heâs kept us from really being engaged in war,â said Rep. Rich McCormick, R-Ga.\n\nMcCormick described Trumpâs Gaza ownership talk as less of a direct play and more of a strategy to put Hamas on notice about permanently ending its conflict with Israel: âItâs showing Hamas, if you donât come to the table and create peace, thereâs gonna be trouble.â\n\nTrumpâs national security advisor, former Rep. Michael Waltz, made a similar point on Wednesday. The president, Waltz told CBS, is ânot seeing any realistic solutionsâ for rebuilding Gaza after its devastation during the war with Israel.\n\nSuggesting âbold, fresh, new ideasâ like a US-controlled Gaza, Waltz added, is designed âto bring the entire region to come with their own solutions.â\n\nStill, Trumpâs Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff faced a myriad of questions about Trumpâs remarks that the US could take over Gaza during a Wednesday lunch with GOP senators. Senate Republicans made clear to Witkoff they donât support that action or spending money to rebuild Gaza, according to attendees.\n\nSome left the meeting with lingering questions on what exactly the plan is.\n\nIn this article:\n\nBefore he floated a US takeover of Gaza, which would require displacing and relocating an estimated 2 million-plus Palestinians, Trump suggested retaking control of the Panama Canal, making Canada the 51st state and claiming the Danish territory of Greenland for the US.\n\nRepublican lawmakers raced to support him on some of those diplomatically risky goals, introducing legislation to support taking the canal back from Panama and to âMake Greenland Great Againâ by purchasing the land from Denmark.\n\nTrumpâs suggestion to take Gaza is drawing more heat from Republicans than those gestures. Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said Trumpâs talk of asserting US control over the Panama Canal âisnât really about intervention,â but admitted his âantenna went upâ after he learned of Trumpâs proposal to take over Gaza.\n\nPaul predicted Wednesday that Trumpâs team would âclarify that heâs not actually for troops in Gaza.â (White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Wednesday that Trump âhas not committed to [troops in the region] yet.â)\n\nHowever, some of Trumpâs closest allies in Congress defended his interest in Gaza. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Brian Mast, R-Fla., told Semafor it amounted to âintervening in Americaâs national security, which is what weâre tasked with doing.â\n\nâThe Middle East is part of Americaâs national security interest,â Mast added. âI donât think Rand Paul would say otherwise, that it isnât. I donât think he would say Israel isnât part of our national security apparatus.â\n\nRep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., a MAGA stalwart and military veteran, attempted to draw a line between Trumpâs diplomatic tough talk and the further step of committing US troops overseas.\n\nâThereâs an appetite for the American people to expand our message, but do it in a peaceful fashion,â she told Semafor.\n\nTrump himself alluded to the dissonant goals at the heart of his foreign policy in his second inaugural address last month, saying that the US âwill measure our success not only by the battles we win but also by the wars that we end â and perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into.â\n\nTrumpâs allies point to ongoing tariff-related negotiations with Canada and Mexico as recent proof that he gets results from threatening a bigger show of US might overseas. So itâs not unreasonable to see his suggestions that the US take over Greenland and Gaza as merely the deployment of strategy that worked for him in business.\n\nâIt really is his way of playing chess when other people are playing checkers,â as one close Hill partner, Ohio Rep. Max Miller, told me.\n\nBut things may change if a head of state ever calls Trumpâs bluff loud enough to bring military involvement closer to potential reality. Trump would then have to clearly define his focus on non-interventionism when it comes to Pentagon resources.\n\nRep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, has called for the use of military force against drug cartels in Mexico; for broader reasons, heâs occasionally dismissed as a neoconservative by some of Trumpâs online backers.\n\nBut Crenshaw said the president has similar views on foreign policy to his own.: âI can defend President Trumpâs general attitude and philosophy on peace and strength, because heâs not a non-interventionist,â he told Semafor.\n\nâMake America Great Again ââmeans leading the world so that America benefits,â Crenshaw added. âSo Trump has actually always been on the same page with people like me.â\n\nBurgess Everett contributed.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Americana\n\nTHE SCENE\n\nTuesdayâs primary guaranteed a Trump-Biden rematch. Thursday nightâs State of the Union showed how the current president would fight it â more liberal populism, more contempt for the MAGA movement, and a strategic retreat on immigration.\n\nâNot since President Lincoln and the Civil War have freedom and democracy been under assault at home as they are today,â Biden said, connecting Trumpâs 2020 election denial to his refusal to commit to defending NATO allies from Russia.\n\nOn policy, Biden again attacked Republicans for blocking a border security bill, looking to neutralize one of their best-polling issues. And he repeatedly accused them of trying to roll back middle class benefits to free up cash for wealthy Americansâ priorities.\n\nâYou guys donât want another $2 trillion tax cut?â President Joe Biden said, baiting the Republican side of the room by saying that the party wanted to keep tax cuts for the rich and inflate the deficit. âI kind of thought thatâs what your plan was.â\n\nDAVIDâS VIEW\n\nAn election-year State of the Union is always a campaign speech, whether or not D.C. tastemakers and norms-lovers like it. Biden delivered his after a GOP primary that had been wrapped up with record speed, and Super Tuesday primaries that had, with very few exceptions, advanced the most pro-Trump, pro-MAGA candidates available to voters. The newest crop of Republican nominees gave Democrats confidence his message would translate up and down the ballot come November.\n\nIn North Carolina, Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson easily won the partyâs gubernatorial nomination, and giddy Democrats cracked open their file of his bizarre and alienating speeches . In Texas, judges and state legislators whoâd crossed Attorney Gen. Ken Paxton lost most of their races â often after former President Donald Trump endorsed their opponents, a favor for an ally whoâd tried to overturn the 2020 election and survived an impeachment over corruption accusations last year.\n\nâThey are the extreme of the extreme,â said Abhi Rahman, a spokesman for the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, which believes that MAGA candidates can help Democrats flip more seats and reduce GOP supermajorities in the states. âTheyâre eating the people who were the extremists.â\n\nThe emerging Democratic strategy is two-fold. One: They need to counteract âTrump amnesia,â the catchall term for voters forgetting aspects of his presidency that they hated in real time. The top of Bidenâs remarks, invoking the Jan. 6 riots and how Republicans had memory-holed them, was part of that.\n\nOutside of Californiaâs central valley, where the House GOPâs super PAC spent money to help Rep. David Valadao beat a challenger who attacked his vote for Trumpâs post-Jan. 6 impeachment, the party was nominating MAGA candidates who kept insisting that the 2020 election was stolen. As Trump locked up the nomination this week, Arizona U.S. Senate candidate Kari Lake was picking up support from GOP leaders, ensuring that the swing stateâs Republican ticket would be led by two candidates whoâd lost it.\n\nâThey just donât really align with the voters of Arizona,â said Arizona Rep. Ruben Gallego, who got a break in his race against Lake this week when independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema opted not to run again. âShe scared the hell out of people last cycle, and she has not gotten any better. Look at how sheâs treated the McCain family, or how she just treated Nikki Haley on her way out.â\n\nThe second part of the strategy looks forward â a people-versus-the-powerful message, portraying Trump as a catspaw for right-wing economic interests.\n\nâI wish there was more coverage of the Trump record of tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy,â said North Carolina Rep. Wiley Nickel, a Democrat leaving the House this year after Republicans re-drew the stateâs map and made his seat unwinnable. âThatâs their record. If Republicans have unified government, Social Security and Medicare will be on the chopping block.â\n\nBiden worked that angle on Thursday, repeatedly, calling out United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain in the gallery and highlighting the GOPâs least popular economic policies. As Semaforâs Shelby Talcott reports, the campaign is increasingly focusing on Project 2025, the Heritage Foundationâs compendium of policy and personnel advice for the next Republican president. Hillary Clintonâs unsuccessful 2016 campaign separated Trump from the rest of the GOP, citing then-House Speaker Paul Ryan as a character witness. Biden is binding them together.\n\nTHE VIEW FROM REPUBLICANS\n\nThe GOP rebuttal started with in-house heckling, and continued with Alabama Sen. Katie Britt, whose official response mostly got panned on style. It was far heavier on immigration than economics, with mentions of high prices but no reference to tax rates. âHis reckless spending dug our economy into a hole and sent the cost of living through the roof,â said Britt, blaming Biden for âsoaring mortgage rates and sky-high childcare costs.â\n\nNOTABLE\n\nHawaii. The âuncommittedâ protest campaign put up its best numbers yet in Wednesdayâs caucuses, grabbing 29% of the vote and seven of 22 available delegates. As in Michigan and Minnesota, a campaign to maximize the non-Biden vote and send a message about Gaza came together quickly. Democratic rules start assigning delegates to any candidate or ballot option that gets 15% of the vote, statewide and in congressional districts. âUncommittedâ now has 20 delegates â 11 in Minnesota, two in Michigan â of the 1,634 assigned in primaries so far.\n\nMake America Great Again, Inc., âJugular.â On Feb. 16, the president made short remarks on the death of Alexei Nalvany, pausing awkwardly after he quoted Trumpâs riff that Russia could do âwhatever the hellâ it wanted if NATO members didnât contribute more to their defense. âI guess I should clear my mind here a little bit and not say what Iâm really thinking,â he said. That quote makes up a third of the Trump super PACâs ad, which got plenty of earned media by running on cable before the State of the Union. Minutes into his speech, Biden attacked Trump over the same quote.\n\nTammy Baldwin for Senate, âAmerican Jobs.â The first ad from Wisconsinâs Democratic senator centers on the Made America Act, both its content (requiring American-made steel for infrastructure projects) and its bipartisan support: âShe got President Trump to sign her Made in America bill, and then she got President Biden to make it permanent.â\n\nReproductive Freedom for All Freedom Fund, âSenate IVF Response.â The abortion rights group formerly known as NARAL is running this ad in six swing House seats, recapping the days since the Alabama Supreme Court halted IVF treatments in the state by ruling that a frozen embryo had a right to life. The GOPâs objection to Senate Democratsâ IVF carve-out bill means âtheyâre coming after IVF.â\n\nOn Tuesday, 19% of Minnesota Democrats picked âuncommittedâ over  Biden, and 29% of Republicans picked Haley over Trump. Right now, the Haley voters are less interested in party unity. Nineteen percent of Republicans who werenât supporting Trump in the primary say they support Biden, while just 6% of Democrats who didnât support Biden say theyâre now supporting Trump. Between a quarter and a fifth of voters who rejected the likely nominees say they support another, unnamed candidate, but no other names were tested, in a state where itâs relatively easy for third parties to get ballot access.\n\nThe fight for Bob Menendezâs Senate seat hasnât had much to do with Menendez himself. He has until March 25 to file for the seat, which he hasnât done yet; he hasnât competed in the roughhouse county convention fights between First Lady Tammy Murphy and Rep. Andy Kim. The larger context is that New Jersey Democrats want him to go away. Seventy-five percent of all New Jersey adults believe that the senatorâs probably guilty of the corruption heâs charged with, including 74% of Democrats; fifty-nine percent of Democrats want him to resign. The last time the senator faced legal trouble, Gov. Chris Christie would have been allowed to pick his replacement. With party control no longer an issue, partisan support for Menendez has imploded.\n\nWhite House. For both major parties, the biggest surprise on Thursday was Joe Biden responding to Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene as he called on Congress to tighten border security.\n\nâIâd be a winnerâ¦not really,â said Biden, stumbling over the prepared line âitâd be a winner for America.â Greene shouted âLaken Riley,â the name of a 22-year old nursing student whose alleged killer entered the United States illegally in 2022. Biden slowly reached for one of the LAKEN RILEY buttons that Greene and other House conservatives wore to the speech.\n\nâLincoln â Lincoln Riley, an innocent young woman who was killed by an illegal,â said Biden, tripping over the victimâs unfamiliar name. âThatâs right. But how many thousands of people have been killed by legals?â He looked up at the public gallery, where Rileyâs parents werenât sitting â they had passed on an invitation offered by another House conservatives. âTo her parents, I say, my heart goes out to you, having lost children myself. I understand.â\n\nBiden was quickly rebuked by multiple Latino members of Congress, for using language â âillegalâ â that had been banished from the partyâs lexicon. âHe should have said âundocumented,ââ Rep. Nancy Pelosi told CNN, âbut itâs not a big thing, okay?â\n\nSenate. California Rep. Katie Porter ran third in Californiaâs top-two primary on Tuesday, then angered fellow Democrats with a word they stopped using after 2020 â ârig.â In social media posts on Wednesday, Porter attributed her loss to âan onslaught of billionaires spending millions to rig this election.â On Thursday, she explained that âriggedâ meant âmanipulated by dishonest means,â referring to super PACs that ran ads against her, one of them funded by the crypto industry.\n\nâThank you, Katie Porter, for giving Fairshake credit for your loss,â a spokeswoman for the PAC told the New York Times. Rep. Adam Schiff, who got his preferred match-up with Republican former baseball player Steve Garvey, told Fox 11 that Porter had never called to concede the race.\n\nHouse. Former New York Rep. George Santos filed to run against one of the Republicans who ousted him last year, making it official while he watched the State of the Union from inside the House chamber. (Being expelled by his colleagues did not end his lifetime floor privileges.) âI look forward to debating him on the issues and on his weak record as a Republican,â he said of Rep. Nick LaLota, who represents the Suffolk County-based 1st Congressional District. In a statement, LaLota said heâd âled the chargeâ to remove Santos and would happily beat him again; his district is significantly more Republican-leaning than the seat Santos flipped in 2022.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, as Nikki Haley ended her presidential campaign, Robert Schwartz was racing the clock. Heâd stayed up late calculating how many votes Haley had won on super Tuesday; his super PAC, Primary Pivot, was about to relaunch as Haley Voters for Biden. He barely had time to finish the announcement. âIt was a much shorter speech than I anticipated,â Schwartz told Americana. But he had his new mission â instead of convincing Democrats to temporarily become pro-Haley Republicans, heâd be urging hundreds of thousands of swing state Haley supporters to vote for the president. This is an edited transcript of the conversation.\n\nAmericana: What did you make of Haleyâs speech, ending her campaign? Was it helpful?\n\nRobert Schwartz: Weâre pleased that she followed this through to Super Tuesday, despite the writing on the wall. She exposed some real fissures in the Republican Party. In our communication with Haley voters, across the political spectrum, there was a deep kind of anger and resentment towards the way Trump and MAGA treated them.\n\nNikki Haley is probably, eventually, going to endorse Trump. But as we saw from the statistics coming out of Iowa, and South Carolina, and even North Carolina, just because Nikki Haley will eventually support Donald Trump, that doesnât mean her supporters will go with her. This is an effort, from people who supported Nikki Haley, to guide as many of them as possible toward the candidate that respects democracy â even if they may disagree with him politically.\n\nAmericana: What makes you think sheâll eventually endorse Trump?\n\nRobert Schwartz: She didnât talk about Biden winning over her voters. She talked about how sheâs always been a Republican, and how itâs the job of Donald Trump to win over her voters. I think that indicates where her loyalty lies. She started by talking about the threat of socialism, which sounds like sheâll eventually attack Joe Biden and the Democrats for being socialists. When she says, âweâve got a country to save,â sheâs not necessarily talking about saving our democracy. Sheâs talking about saving our country from the path that itâs currently on. If she wants to be in the conversation in 2028, ultimately, itâs good for her to be seen as a loyal Republican. But weâd love it if she doesnât endorse him.\n\nAmericana: What resources are you starting this effort with, in terms of mailing lists, money â basic campaign tools?\n\nRobert Schwartz: We started Primary Pivot with no money, but of the original $1 million that we raised, we have a significant amount that was set aside for Georgia, if she stayed in. We can spend that elsewhere. Weâd reached out to voters in nine different states and sent 2.1 million mailers and text messages to over 1.1 million unique individuals, many in Michigan, North Carolina, and Georgia. Weâve already been aggressively reaching out to these people. We bought voter files in all of these states, and we focused on people who had voted in a previous Democratic primary. If they ended up voting in the Republican primary, they almost definitely voted for Nikki Haley.\n\nAmericana: How do you communicate with them for the next eight months?\n\nRobert Schwartz: We really see three groups of voters. The first group is Biden supporters who pulled a Republican ballot. We can reconfirm their support, but they should be Biden supporters in November anyway â we donât need to aggressively recruit them. The second group of voters that we targeted was the Biden skeptics, the ones that thought he was too old, the ones in New Hampshire that were considering Dean Phillips. Those are people we and the Biden campaign will have to aggressively court.\n\nThe third group of voters, which is going to be the most important and the most difficult to reach, is conservative, Republican Haley supporters. We call them the genuine Haley supporters. Many of those people have not previously voted in the Democratic primary. We are going to hyper focus on them, and we have a number of Republicans and former Republicans on our staff that will kind of flip our message away from âyou may disagree with Nikki Haley on abortion or climate, but at least she respects democracyâ¦â to âyou may disagree with Joe Biden on abortion and climate change, but at least he respects democracy.â Weâll emphasize the foreign policy issues that Biden and Haley agree on.\n\nAmericana: Did Haley herself do enough to win over these anti-Trump, pro-democracy voters? I met some people who were tempted to support her, but stopped themselves, because she said sheâd pardon Trump.\n\nRobert Schwartz: If Nikki Haley had gone the full Chris Christie route, or the full Liz Cheney route, which was where many Democrats wanted her to go, I think the results would have been obvious. We wanted Nikki Haley to win the nomination, not just make a point. So, we felt that she strategically navigated those issues in a way that allowed her to not tank her support among conservative voters, who are now going to be essential in building a broad Biden coalition. I do think there are questions as to whether her campaign would have survived as long as it did without our efforts to bring in independent and left-of-center voters.\n\nAmericana: What did you make of the Biden campaignâs reaction to her leaving the race?\n\nRobert Schwartz: It was a great first step. There have been all these outreach efforts by the Biden campaign to reach these uncommitted voters in Michigan. There were about 100,000 uncommitted voters in Michigan â but there were 300,000 Haley voters. Those uncommitted voters donât have anywhere else to go, except to stay home and throw the election to somebody they absolutely despise. Haley voters are incredibly important in places like Michigan, and North Carolina, and Georgia and the Biden campaign should be aggressively courting them, and we expect they will be doing the same type of voter outreach that we are, but with a different message.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

Read it now .\n\nWEST PALM BEACH, Fla. â Former US President Donald Trump claimed victory in Tuesdayâs election, saying he and his campaign âovercame obstacles that nobody thought possible,â marking a remarkable return to power for the former American leader.\n\nâI want to thank the American people for the extraordinary honorâ of returning to the White House, he said in remarks at the Palm Beach County Convention Center, flanked by his wife, Melania, his children, and his running mate, JD Vance, as well as Vanceâs wife. âAmerica has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate.â\n\nâThis will truly be the golden age of America,â Trump added. âThis is a magnificent victory for the American people that will allow us to make America great again.â\n\nThough his win has not been officially confirmed by all US networks, Fox News has projected his victory, and the ex-president remains on track to return to the White House. Vice President Kamala Harrisâ campaign co-chair Cedric Richmond told her supporters that she would not be speaking this evening, and she hasnât conceded the race.\n\nTeam Trump, buoyed by their internal data, went into Election Day feeling cautiously optimistic â even as the superstitious nature of the team had them triple checking the good polling numbers. As the night went on, campaign aides only became more bullish, with some predicting fairly early on that Trump could sweep all seven battleground states.\n\nTrump spent much of his evening at an exclusive Mar-a-Lago event, surrounded by his top campaign aides and supporters, including Elon Musk and Dana White. Trumpâs team kept him updated on the race as he sat in the ballroom, while his vice presidential pick, JD Vance, spent part of his evening in a room upstairs with his aides watching results roll in.\n\nA post mortem hasnât been fully fleshed out, but Trump campaign aides were quick to point out that concerns over things like Trumpâs ground game and the joke about Puerto Rico that a comedian made at his Madison Square Garden rally appeared overblown by parts of the media and Democrats. One aide argued that Harris ran too much on âintangibleâ issues like the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the US Capitol, when voters were far more concerned about the economy.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Thursday portrayed former President Donald Trump and his supporters as a threat to government institutions and the Constitution itself, eviscerating his likely opponent in the 2024 general election for disparaging top military officials and for his plans to exert more control over the entire federal bureaucracy.\n\nâTodayâs Republican Party is driven and intimidated by MAGA Republican extremists,â Biden said in an address from Tempe, Ariz., referring to Trumpâs popular âMake America Great Againâ slogan. He described Trump â who he referred to as the âdefeated former presidentâ â as a âthreat to the brick and mortar of our federal government institutionsâ and the âcharacter of our nation.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nBiden explicitly referred to proposals by Trump and other GOP candidates to exert more power over the federal government. Trump has often waged against the âdeep stateâ and in the waning days of his administration issued an executive order called âSchedule Fâ that aimed to do away with many civil servants. (Biden eventually reversed the order when he took office.)\n\nGOP contender Vivek Ramaswamy has also laid out plans to get rid of the FBI, ATF, the Education Department and other key agencies. The Heritage Foundation has launched a multi-million dollar project to staff the next Republican administration and whittle back the administrative state.\n\nâMAGA extremists proclaim support for law enforcement only to say, âwe must destroy the FBI,ââ Biden said.\n\nDuring his speech Thursday, Biden also honored the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., announcing funding for a new library named after his longtime friend.\n\nThis was the fourth speech that Biden has given to highlight what he says are grave threats to American democracy, and it was perhaps his most forceful and direct confrontation of Trump yet, as the two head toward a likely rematch in the 2024 election.\n\nAt one point, Biden read a quote from one of Trumpâs posts on Truth Social suggesting outgoing Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark Milley would have faced punishment by âdeathâ over calls he made to a Chinese general.\n\nâAlthough I donât believe even a majority of Republicans think that, the silence is deafening,â Biden said.\n\nHis remarks crystalized Democratsâ strategy to repeat their messaging from the 2022 midterms that branded Republican candidates as âextreme MAGAâ and warned of the threat Trump poses to democracy by invoking the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\nBut Biden reoriented the argument on Thursday, also taking on explicit proposals from Trump and other GOP candidates.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Republicans insist they could eventually restrain Trump and Musk\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nAside from Matt Gaetz, the Republican Congress is showing very little interest in checking President Donald Trumpâs power right now.\n\nOver the past 24 hours, a handful of once-reluctant Republicans approved of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Tulsi Gabbardâs bids to join Trumpâs Cabinet. On top of the mild GOP complaints about the dismantling of the US Agency for International Development and freeze on government spending, free-trading Republicans who warned against a potential trade war with Canada and Mexico are giving Trump plenty of latitude in that area.\n\nWith little threat of the GOP Congress stepping in to restrain it, Trump â and Elon Musk, empowered with significant authority to reshape the federal government â have staged a dizzying show of executive-branch dominance over the federal legislature.\n\nTrumpâs ability to wield power to start his second term has prompted increasingly loud charges from Democrats that Republicans are too afraid to stand up to him. Itâs a line that Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., is likely to hear for two more years as he prepares for a reelection bid on the front lines of 2026âs battle for the Senate.\n\nTillis is throwing the charge right back at Democrats, accusing them of being pliant for former President Joe Biden.\n\nâIn the last Democratic administration, which [nominees] did they even raise a concern [about]? Zero. Like, zero. So itâs disingenuous. Itâs the same old, tired playbook,â Tillis told Semafor when asked about the idea that heâs rolling over for Trump.\n\nHe contended that there will eventually be red lines that the Republican Congress wonât permit Trump to cross, âwhether itâs on nominees, or whether itâs on policy. I can see things where Musk â heâs coming up with good ideas â he could go too far. We could say, âGreat idea. It doesnât work in a public institution.ââ\n\nIt hasnât come to that yet. And Republicans are plainly sensitive to the idea that they are letting legislative power atrophy after charging Democrats with the same misdeed during the presidencies of Biden and Barack Obama.\n\nSen. Todd Young, R-Ind., even spoke to Trump directly about Gabbardâs nomination as director of national intelligence, but told reporters Trump wasnât trying to twist his arm. Young said Trump told him Gabbardâs vote was âimportant, but he said, âYou know what, Todd, weâre going to work together on all kinds of other things to Make America Great Again.ââ\n\nRepublicansâ attitudes may change if voters sour on Trump, but thus far the president has had wide latitude to remodel government. Heâs sparked frustration from moderate Republicans like Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins but little protest from party leaders.\n\nStill, Tillis isnât the only senior Republican to insist that they will not let Musk or the executive branch further infringe on Congressâs vaunted power of the purse.\n\nâWe do have to really make sure that the spending and the appropriation and the power of the purse remains with the House and Senate,â said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va. âAny encroachment on that, I think we should, as a body, stand up and resist.â\n\nRepublicans already concede they will likely need to push through legislation to finalize changes to USAID. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., told Semafor that Republicans are quietly critical of undercutting foreign aid development programs but âare afraid to say it. Theyâre afraid of retribution.â\n\nâIâm surprised that so many people here who have supported foreign assistance programs now suddenly are willing to let them be cut off, to the detriment of security,â said Shaheen, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee. âThese are not like turning off a light switch that you can shut it down and start it again.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nGaetzâs implosion last year led Democrats â and even some Republicans â to believe that Trumpâs crop of unconventional nominees could be forced into withdrawal or defeated. Yet the pugilistic president, his extremely online base and GOP leaders teamed up to advance every other nominee in that group.\n\nOne of them, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, is already confirmed; Gabbard and Kennedy are on the goal line to get there. Gaetz remains the only scuttled Trump Cabinet pick.\n\nYoung plainly struggled with his vote on Gabbard. He required written assurances from her on the possibility of pardoning Edward Snowden and her views on US surveillance power before moving ahead. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., a doctor, was open about his reservations about Kennedyâs vaccine skepticism; he voted for Kennedy just as Trump mused online about vaccinesâ effect on autism.\n\nTillis said he and Cassidy are both âindependentâ and âprepared to offer up our concernsâ about nominees. He warned that Kennedy would âregret itâ if he took major steps against vaccines.\n\nBoth Cassidy and Young credited Vice President JD Vance with helping them get answers from nominees. And both have crossed Trump in the past â Young declined to endorse him last year, and Cassidy voted to convict him in the 2021 impeachment trial.\n\nStill, one ally of Trump and Kennedy said Cassidy was always seen within the administration as a yes in the end.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Trump will support Cassidy in 2026, or at least stay neutral.\n\nThe Senate minority leader told Semafor in a recent interview that he thinks Republicans will eventually be more comfortable working with Democrats on things that Trump may not totally love.\n\nâItâs going to take a little while. Because right now theyâre all afraid of Trump. Trump is going to have less power and less clout six months from now because of screwups like the OMB one,â Schumer said, referring to a blunt budget freeze that the administration revoked last week.\n\nTrumpâs power on Capitol Hill is stronger than it was in 2017, and heâs using every bit of that extra clout. Many of his Republican skeptics are no longer in Congress, and longtime GOP lawmakers see little upside to battling with him at this early date.\n\nThe biggest early question mark is Musk: If he starts targeting popular government programs, heâll likely face pushback from the GOP. But his initial forays have provoked little response from Republicans so far.\n\nShelby Talcott contributed to this report.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Trump PAC likely committed felonies, Wisconsin ethics panel finds\n\nInsights from The Guardian, The New York Times, and Politico\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nAn ethics panel in Wisconsin has recommended felony charges against a fundraising arm of former President Donald Trumpâs reelection campaign, alleging it sought to circumvent campaign finance laws in an attempt to unseat a top GOP lawmaker in the state.\n\nThe bipartisan panel alleged that Trumpâs team skirted campaign finance laws with a scheme they said was intended to hurt the reelection chances of Wisconsinâs Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, after he refused to back Trumpâs attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nThe Wisconsin Ethics Commission said it found probable cause that Trumpâs Save America committee â as well as several state and local Republican officials â committed felonies, recommending that district attorneys look into the allegations and prosecute them. Itâs rare for such panels to pursue serious charges, according to The Washington Post.\n\nThe panel alleged that during a 2022 primary for the Wisconsin Assembly in which Vos was running, the Trump PAC donated to county parties, which illegally steered the money to support Vosâs primary challenger. While individuals can only give a maximum of $1,000 to individual candidates, there is no cap on donations to political parties.\n\nIf district attorneys donât act on the panelâs recommendation within 60 days, the Wisconsin panel can refer the request for prosecution to the stateâs Attorney General, Josh Kaul. At least one DA told The Post she would make a decision quickly.\n\nVos â by all accounts a loyal conservative who used his time as Speaker to consolidate Republican power â fell out of favor with the party after refusing to embrace Trumpâs claim that he won the 2020 election in Wisconsin, and not President Joe Biden.\n\nâ[Vosâs] unwillingness to cross that line has turned him into a pariah on the far right ...an enemy of Trump and a symbol of the current state of the Republican party where loyalty to Trump is the key litmus test,â The Guardian reported.\n\nThe Speaker, whose split with Trump made him the subject of a recall effort, said he was not surprised by the move to oust him, saying that âthe people involved cannot seem to get over any election in which their preferred candidate doesnât win.â\n\nSave America is racking up millions in legal bills for Trump, Politico reported, â underscoring how his legal woes continue to suck up resources in an election year.â The group, which has become the primary entity for paying Trumpâs legal bills, reported $4.8 million in new bills in January alone. It spent nearly $50 million on legal fees in 2023.\n\nâThe legal costs, which are expected to grow as Trump faces four criminal indictments, are likely to be a drag on his reelection effortâs finances,â Bloomberg reported. If he keeps spending at this rate, the outlet noted, heâll run out of money that can be used for legal fees by midyear.\n\nA new super PAC supporting Trump has âalready created friction within Mr. Trumpâs broader orbit,â The New York Times reported, because multiple super PACs create the potential for clashing messaging. The group, Right for America, could be a bit late to the party, The Times said. The main Super PAC supporting Trump, Make America Great Again Inc., has been at work for months already.\n\nAxios called the new PAC an outlet for Republican donors â looking for splashy ways to give .â But some in Trumpâs orbit told the website they have âserious concerns that a vehicle of such strategic importance â with a potentially huge amount of money â will be in the hands of people who havenât run a similar-sized enterprise.â\n\nSign up for Semafor principals\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives."

Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nThere were no cameras in the Miami courthouse where Donald Trump turned himself in on Tuesday, leaving cable news stuck cycling through legal analysts as not much happened outside.\n\nSo Trump gave them something to watch: After pleading ânot guiltyâ to 37 felony counts, he made a surprise visit to famed Cuban restaurant Versailles. Supporters took pictures with him, prayed over him, and even sang âHappy Birthdayâ for his 77th (âsome birthday,â he joked).\n\nOn CNN, Jake Tapper asked the network to cut away . âHeâs trying to turn it into a spectacle and into a campaign ad,â the host said.Â\n\nIn this article:\n\nHe was right âÂ and it was a smart move. On Fox News, which has featured plenty of dour legal takes as well, viewers were suddenly treated to a leader triumphantly surrounded by his fans.\n\nThe episode was a preview of where this all is going: The Trump campaign and his legal defense are essentially one and the same.\n\nIf there was any doubt, he cleared it up with a rally at Bedminster late that night that stuck to his established playbook.\n\nHe conceded nothing: âI did everything right and they indicted me!â he shouted.\n\nHe promised retaliation: A âreal special prosecutorâ to investigate Biden and his family, undercutting the Republicans defending him as part of a high-minded stand against the appearance of a partisan Justice Department.\n\nAnd he went on the attack against his top opponent: âraging lunaticâ Jack Smith.\n\nTrump, who said Smith âlooks like a thugâ and specializes in âpolitical hit jobs,â cited his work on a corruption case against former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell that the Supreme Court overturned in a landmark ruling. His approach was all but indistinguishable from the treatment he gave various presidential rivals, right down to targeting Smithâs wife.\n\nThe closest Trump came to directly acknowledging the seriousness of the charges heâs facing was a riff on the Espionage Act, which he said âhas been used to go after traitors and spiesâ and should not apply to him (the relevant charges are not about spying and donât need to be, though there are critics of the broader law in that regard).\n\nBy the end of the speech, the line between his presidential and legal campaign had disappeared entirely: âOn November 5, 2024, justice will be done, we will take back our country, and we will make America great again,â he said.\n\nThere are risks to this approach. Trumpâs words can and will be used against him in a court of law, and potentially undercut his lawyersâ strategy (though they vetted his speech, an aide said). He received a reminder of that on Tuesday, when a judge allowed E. Jean Carroll to amend her defamation lawsuit âÂ which already resulted in a $5 million jury decision against him âÂ to include his more recent comments lashing out at her.\n\nBut Trumpâs also not a normal defendant. He can win the White House and pardon himself. He can bully his rivals into promising to do the same âÂ one of them, Vivek Ramaswamy, has already done so, while Nikki Haley, who has criticized Trumpâs conduct, said she was âinclined in favorâ of a pardon given her discomfort at the idea of a jailed former president. He can hope the judge he personally appointed, who was excoriated by a circuit court that determined she lent him special treatment in prior rulings, is also uneasy with trying him like a typical accused felon.\n\nFinally, Trump can also hope that the case heâs making daily â that heâs a victim of a partisan witch hunt â seeps into the public, where the court has to find jurors who somehow arenât tainted by the news surrounding the most famous and polarizing figure in the country. Those restaurant-goers watching him work the crowd? Any one of them could end up in a jury pool.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Trump promises âgolden ageâ in second inaugural address\n\nSign up for Semafor Americana: An insiderâs guide to American power. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nPresident Donald Trump began his second term on Monday with the promise of a new âgolden ageâ at an inauguration with public attendance restricted due to the cold â but prime seats reserved for some of the worldâs wealthiest men.\n\nTrumpâs inaugural address, delivered in the Capitol Rotunda after the ceremony moved indoors in frigid temperatures, highlighted a series of executive orders on immigration, energy and the federal government that he plans to sign immediately. But some of his most telling remarks came as he addressed a favorite topic: himself, and his stunning rise back to power.\n\nHe promised a comeback for the nation that he would lead from the perspective of being âtested and challenged moreâ than any of his predecessors.\n\nâI was saved by God to make America great again,â Trump said, bringing the crowd to its feet with a reference to last summerâs failed assassination attempt against him.\n\nFormer President Joe Biden stayed in his seat during that ovation. Biden also stayed seated as the new president detailed how heâd unwind four years of Democratic policies, declaring a ânational emergency at our Southern borderâ and an energy emergency that would include an end to electric vehicle mandates and aspects of the progressive âGreen New Deal.â\n\nAmericaâs problems, Trump said, would be âannihilatedâ by the âgreat momentumâ begun by his victory in November.\n\nAmong the campaign promises that Trump is immediately instituting are pledges to roll back LGBTQ protections and DEI initiatives. Other promises were partly fulfilled with his first set of executive orders, including a new âexternal revenue serviceâ that would collect revenue from tariffs on imported goods that he has vowed but not yet imposed.\n\nCriticizing the natural disaster response of local and federal governments in his speech, Trump said that it had even harmed some of the âwealthiest and most powerful people in our country, some of whom are sitting here right now.â\n\nIt was a conspicuous nod to the billionaires who have worked to win his favor and showed up in person on Monday, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg â and of course, Tesla CEO-turned government cost-cutting adviser Elon Musk.\n\nTrump also said he would work to end the nationâs âchronic disease epidemic,â a cause that he has adopted since former presidential rival Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. endorsed him and ultimately became his nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nRepublicans have already worked quickly to implement Trumpâs agenda, which is expected to be filled out with further executive orders in the coming days. The Senate is expected to confirm Marco Rubio as Secretary of State on Monday, but the rest of Trumpâs Cabinet will have to wait; negotiations are ongoing to approve some other national security picks.\n\nAfter the formal address, other Republicans and inaugural guests who were seated in the Capitol Visitor Center got a different, but also familiar, side of Trump â 30 minutes of remarks with no teleprompter.\n\nAfter joking that heâd given House Speaker Mike Johnson a âmajority of almost nothing,â Trump criticized the January 6 committee, repeated the false claim that the 2020 election was stolen from him, and suggested that he could have won California if voters had been required to show ID.\n\nIn this article:\n\nUnlike eight years ago, when Democrats made a show of boycotting or otherwise resisting Trumpâs inauguration, they tried to ignore this one.\n\nSome attended the peaceful transfer of power in person, hopeful that they could work with the new president on a few key issues.\n\nâI am showing up for our Constitution today and for the office, not for the man,â Vermont Rep. Becca Balint told Semafor. âIn a healthy democracy, we donât just go to the inauguration when our candidate wins.â\n\nOthers skipped it, spending Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day in their districts, and explained why on social media: âI donât celebrate rapists,â said New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nâI will not be surety to this change,â said Tennessee Rep. Steve Cohen, who said that he was watching the transition from democracy to âautocracyâ from Memphis. âMaya Angelou said when somebody shows you who they are, believe them. Trump has shown us who he is.â\n\nAnd quite a few Democrats winced as Biden greeted Trump at the White House by telling him âwelcome homeâ â a jarring show of courtesy from an outgoing president whoâd warned that Trump and his allies ârepresent extremism that threatens the very foundations of our Republic.â\n\nTrump is just the second president to win non-consecutive terms. Itâs a quirk with some surprising benefits.\n\nEight years ago, Trump inherited a country with 4.8% unemployment, low interest rates, and no inflation; he promised to âbring back jobsâ and end the âAmerican carnageâ of crime and poverty. He took the stage on Monday with unemployment at 4.1%, inflation below its post-pandemic heights, and a ceasefire in the Israel-Gaza war that dominated the last year of Bidenâs presidency. (Trump announced the deal before Biden did, though both the outgoing and incoming teams had worked on it.)\n\nSimply put, Trump got a double boost from his Democratic predecessors.\n\nIn 2017, both parties were still uncertain about how Trump would handle the job â whether its scale and power would change him, and which rally rhetoric would turn into tangible policies. This time around, he spoke more confidently, making promises directly from his campaign stump speech and the post-election period.\n\nSome of those rhetorical flourishes were the quirky stuff that has endeared Trump to his base; I donât think many Democrats woke up on Nov. 6 expecting to hear Trump talk about restoring William McKinleyâs name to the nationâs biggest mountain.\n\nBroadly speaking, neither party is wondering how Trump will treat the Oval Office. Heâs the leader of a Republican Party that has re-built its agenda around him, and the media that was so skeptical of his ambitions in the first term is more beleaguered than ever.\n\nBurgess Everett and Kadia Goba contributed.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

      "text": "America Should Never Be 'Great Again'\n\nP resident Donald Trump is different. Unlike any of his forty-four predecessors, he does not even pretend to care about constitutional rules or official protocols. He has no need for facts or norms. And in his drive to \" Make America Great Again ,\" he discards not just the balance of power within our government, but also the deeper balance between our two major myths about what made America great in the first place.\n\nIn the end, that might be a good thing.\n\nThe first of those stories tells us that America's greatness comes from its pioneer spirit, and that making society nicer will weaken the nation and embolden its foes. It centers on the frontier, and began with the seventeenth-century Puritans, who saw themselves as children of light, struggling to claim property and bring piety to the \"dark wilderness.\" A century later, the Protestant Ulstermen, who had already displaced the people of northern Ireland, seized native lands from Pennsylvania to Georgia. They did so believing that they were the tip of civilization's spear and that the blood they shed washed away their sins. Around 1800, the French Revolution made the United States seem like the only moral country on Earth. Then Andrew Jackson, a slave-owner and businessman of Ulster background, told Americans that they were not just free but also chosen to take more property from new frontiers. Of course, this is a story about white people, and it lingers like a poison in our body politic.\n\nThe second story focuses instead on the U.S. Constitution as the starting point for a more lawful society. Among its adherents was Abraham Lincoln, who began his career by condemning the Jacksonians' wars to expand slavery. (Lincoln was more cautious in attacking slavery itself, which the Constitution implicitly supported.) In this narrative, the Constitution keeps us free by holding our leaders within the law and then expanding it to new groups of Americans, including the non-white victims of the pioneers. Thus President Obama, a Lincoln admirer, urged Americans to \"perfect\" the Union once again, to carry on the work that the Founders began.\n\nFor much of our history, these two narratives fed off each other. The Jackson myth told us that we were already good and lawful, and thus entitled to conquer and expand; the Lincoln tradition cautioned that we had to remain good and lawful by honoring the Constitution. Together they gave Americans a deep sense of innocence - of original virtue and pure intentions, of heroic pasts that held all the answers.\n\nBut that ended on January 20, 2017. Now that America's innocent self-image helped him win, Trump has no more use for the country's ideals. The only model he has for the nation is the man in his mirror, who does whatever he wants just because he can. He has driven the frontier approach off its constitutional rails, declaring open season on anyone who does not look and think like he does: Most Americans, as it turns out - along with the rest of the world.\n\nThe American myth is at a crossroads. Our old stories will not save us. We need a new way to understand ourselves, a more honest account of our troubled past to help us face our troubling future.\n\nThis narrative should note that the frontier was a grim and guilty place, dominated by scoundrels and speculators, and that most people much preferred to live in safe, stable communities. Our new story would also give due credit to the Founders' design, while recognizing that it was only one of many plans to come out of the Revolution. Far from a blueprint for democracy, the Constitution kept real power away from ordinary people while protecting wealthy investors and slave-owners. It had nothing to do with human rights or social equality. In short, our new story would admit that much of our democracy has grown despite the rules and myths of the Founders and the frontier, not because of them.\n\nFreed of those rules and myths, we could finally learn from our own past and from other democracies. We would recognize that constitutions change because nations change. (The French, for their part, are on their fifth republic.) No longer insisting that we have all the answers, we would be less eager to use our war machine and to spend so much of our wealth upon it. More aware of our own sins, we would feel less driven to avenge them abroad.\n\nMore profoundly, we could see each other as flawed and vulnerable members of the same society, as civic brothers and sisters who are equally American. No longer dazed by frontier mythologies or blocked by Constitutional rules, we could think boldly and practically about a happier, more caring nation - one based on a new Bill of Rights, perhaps, or even on a new Constitution.\n\nWhy not guarantee every single American good health care and schooling, simply because they are American? Why beg faceless corporations to keep jobs here when we could directly employ everyone who wants to make their community greener, safer, more efficient or simply more pleasant? For that matter, why insist that we must always work harder, when most of us want a better balance between work, family and friends? Why tear open new frontiers, when we can take better care of what we already have?\n\nAs another Founder once noted, the Earth belongs to the living. Letting go of our mighty fictions is the first step in remembering that.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "Read the Transcript of Trump's 2025 Speech to Congress Here\n\nP resident Donald Trump addressed a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night, his first such speech of his second term.\n\nHe faced hecklers and Democratic protests as he discussed his agenda , touted his accomplishments , defended his foreign policy dealings , and demeaned his opponents .\n\nThe following transcript was prepared and provided to TIME by Rev , using AI-powered software, and it was reviewed and edited for accuracy by TIME staff.\n\n***\n\nThank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. It's a great honor. Thank you very much.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaker Johnson, Vice President Vance, the First Lady of the United States, members of the United States Congress-thank you very much. And to my fellow citizens:\n\nAmerica is back.\n\n[Republicans chant: USA! USA!]\n\nSix weeks ago, I stood beneath the dome of this Capitol and proclaimed the dawn of the \"Golden Age of America.\" From that moment on, it has been nothing but swift and unrelenting action to usher in the greatest and most successful era in the history of our country. We have accomplished more in 43 days than most administrations accomplished in four years-or eight years, and we are just getting started.\n\nThank you.\n\nI return to this chamber tonight to report that America's momentum is back. Our spirit is back, our pride is back, our confidence is back, and the American dream is surging bigger and better than ever before.\n\nThe American dream is unstoppable, and our country is on the verge of a comeback, the likes of which the world has never witnessed, and perhaps will never witness again. There's never been anything like it. The presidential election of November 5th was a mandate, like has not been seen in many decades. We won all seven swing states, giving us an electoral college victory of 312 votes. We won the popular vote by big numbers and won counties in our country-\n\n[ Republicans chant: USA! USA! ]\n\n-and won counties in our country, 2,700 to 525, on a map that reads almost completely red for Republican. Now for the first time in modern history, more Americans believe that our country is headed in the right direction than the wrong direction. In fact, it's an astonishing record, 27 point swing-the most ever.\n\nLikewise, small business optimism saw its single largest one month gain ever recorded: a 41-point jump.\n\n[ House Speaker Mike Johnson interjects to call out Rep. Al Green (D-Texas), who has repeatedly interrupted Trump's speech . Green is escorted out afterwards. ]\n\n[ Johnson: Mr. President, you may continue. ]\n\nThank you.\n\nOver the past six weeks, I have signed nearly 100 Executive Orders and taken more than 400 executive actions-a record to restore common sense, safety, optimism and wealth all across our wonderful land. The people elected me to do the job, and I'm doing it. In fact, it has been stated by many that the first month of our presidency-it's our presidency-is the most successful in the history of our nation. By many. And what makes it even more impressive is that, do you know who number two is? George Washington. How about that? How about it? I don't know about that list, but we'll take it.\n\nWithin hours of taking the oath of office, I declared a national emergency on our southern border, and I deployed the U.S. military and border patrol to repel the invasion of our country. And what a job they've done. As a result, illegal border crossings last month were by far the lowest ever recorded-ever. They heard my words and they chose not to come. Much easier that way, in comparison under Joe Biden, the worst President in American history, there were hundreds of thousands of illegal crossings a month. And virtually all of them, including murderers, drug dealers, gang members and people from mental institutions and insane asylums, were released into our country. Who would want to do that?\n\nThis is my fifth such speech to Congress, and once again, I look at the Democrats in front of me and I realize there is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy or to make them stand or smile or applaud, nothing I can do. I could find a cure to the most devastating disease-a disease that would wipe out entire nations-or announce the answers to the greatest economy in history, or the stoppage of crime to the lowest levels ever recorded. And these people sitting right here will not clap, will not stand and certainly will not cheer for these astronomical achievements. They won't do it no matter what. Five-five times I've been up here, it's very sad, and it just shouldn't be this way.\n\nSo Democrats sitting before me, for just this one night, why not join us in celebrating so many incredible wins for America, for the good of our nation, let's work together and let's truly make America great again.\n\nEvery day, my administration is fighting to deliver the change America needs to bring a future that America deserves, and we're doing it. This is a time for big dreams and bold action. Upon taking office, I imposed an immediate freeze on all federal hiring, a freeze on all new federal regulations and a freeze on all foreign aid.\n\nI terminated the ridiculous Green New Scam. I withdrew from the unfair Paris Climate Accord, which was costing us trillions of dollars that other countries were not paying. I withdrew from the corrupt World Health Organization, and I also withdrew from the anti-American U.N. Human Rights Council. We ended all of Biden's environmental restrictions that were making our country far less safe and totally unaffordable. And importantly, we ended the last administration's insane electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto workers and companies from economic destruction.\n\nTo unshackle our economy, I have directed that for every one new regulation, 10 old regulations must be eliminated, just like I did in my very successful first day. And in that first term, we set records on ending unnecessary rules and regulations like no other President had done before. We ordered all federal workers to return to the office-they will either show up for work in person or be removed from their job. And we have ended weaponized government, where, as an example, a sitting President is allowed to viciously prosecute his political opponent-like me. How did that work out? Not too good. Not too good.\n\nAnd I have stopped all government censorship and brought back free speech in America. It's back.\n\nAnd two days ago, I signed an order making English the official language of the United States of America. I renamed the Gulf of Mexico the \"Gulf of America.\" And likewise, I renamed-for a great President, William McKinley, Mount McKinley again. Beautiful Alaska, we love Alaska.\n\nWe've ended the tyranny of so-called \"diversity, equity and inclusion\" policies all across the entire federal government and indeed the private sector and our military. And our country will be woke no longer. We believe that, whether you are a doctor, an accountant, a lawyer or an air traffic controller, you should be hired and promoted based on skill and competence-not race or gender. Very important. You should be hired based on merit, and the Supreme Court, in a brave and very powerful decision, has allowed us to do so. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank\n\nyou.\n\nWe have removed the poison of critical race theory from our public schools. And I signed an order making it the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders: male and female.\n\nI also signed an Executive Order to ban men from playing in women's sports. Three years ago, Payton McNabb was an all-star high school athlete, one of the best, preparing for a future in college sports. But when her girls volleyball match was invaded by a male, he smashed the ball so hard in Payton's face, causing traumatic brain injury, partially paralyzing her right side and ending her athletic career. It was a shot like she's never seen before. She's never seen anything like it. Payton is here tonight in the gallery, and Payton, from now on, schools will kick the men off the girls team, or they will lose all federal funding.\n\nAnd if you really want to see numbers, just take a look at what happened in the woman's boxing, weight lifting, track and field, swimming or cycling, where a male recently finished a long distance race five hours and 14 minutes ahead of a woman for a new record. By five hours. Broke the record by five hours. It's demeaning for women, and it's very bad for our country. We're not going to put up with it any longer.\n\nWhat I have just described is only a small fraction of the common sense revolution that is now-because of us-sweeping the entire world. Common sense has become a common theme, and we will never go back. Never, ever going to let that happen.\n\nAmong my very highest priorities is to rescue our economy and get dramatic and immediate relief to working families. As you know, we inherited from the last administration an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare. Their policies drove up energy prices, pushed up grocery costs, and drove the necessities of life out of reach for millions and millions of Americans. They've-never had anything like it. We suffered the worst inflation in 48 years, but perhaps even in the history of our country, they're not sure. As President, I'm fighting every day to reverse this damage and make America affordable again. Joe Biden, especially, let the price of eggs get out of control-the egg prices, out of control. And we're working hard to get it back down. Secretary, do a good job on that. You inherited a total mess from the previous Administration. Do a good job.\n\nA major focus of our fight to defeat inflation is rapidly reducing the cost of energy. The previous administration cut the number of new oil and gas leases by 95%, slowed pipeline construction to a halt, and closed more than 100 power plants. We are opening up many of those power plants right now.\n\nAnd frankly, we have never seen anything like it. That's why, on my first day in office, I declared a National Energy emergency. As you've heard me say many times, we have more liquid gold under our feet than any nation on earth, and by far. And now I fully authorize the most talented team ever assembled to go and get it. It's called \"Drill, Baby, Drill.\"\n\nMy administration is also working on a gigantic natural gas pipeline in Alaska, among the largest in the world, where Japan, South Korea and other nations want to be our partner, with investments of trillions of dollars each. There's never been anything like that one. It will be truly spectacular. It's all set to go. The permitting is gotten, and later this week, I will also take historic action to dramatically expand production of critical minerals and rare earths here in the USA.\n\nTo further combat inflation, we will not only be reducing the cost of energy, but we'll be ending the flagrant waste of taxpayer dollars. And to that end, I have created the brand new Department of Government Efficiency-DOGE. Perhaps you've heard of it, perhaps. Which is headed by Elon Musk, who is in the gallery tonight.\n\nThank you, Elon. He's working very hard. He didn't need this. He didn't need this. Thank you very much. We appreciate it. Everybody here, even this side [pointing to Democrats in the chamber] , appreciates it, I believe. They just don't want to admit that.\n\nJust listen to some of the appalling waste we have already identified: $22 billion from HHS to provide free housing and cars for illegal aliens. $45 million for diversity, equity and inclusion scholarships in Burma. $40 million to improve the social and economic inclusion of sedentary migrants. Nobody knows what that is. $8 million to promote LGBTQI+ in the African nation of Lesotho, which nobody has ever heard of, $60 million for indigenous peoples and Afro-Colombian empowerment in Central America. $60 million. $8 million for making mice transgender. This is real. $32 million for a left-wing propaganda operation in Moldova. $10 million for male circumcision in Mozambique. $20 million for the Arab Sesame Street in the Middle East. It's a program. $20 million for a program. $1.9 billion to recently-created decarbonization of homes committee headed up, and we know she's involved, just at the last moment, the money was passed over by a woman named Stacey Abrams. Have you ever heard of her? A $3.5 million consulting contract for lavish fish monitoring. $1.5 billion for voter confidence in Liberia, $14 million for social cohesion in Mali, $59 million for illegal alien hotel rooms in New York City. He's a real estate developer. He's done very well. $250,000 to increase vegan local climate action innovation in Zambia, $42 million for social and behavior change in Uganda, $14 million for improving public procurement in Serbia, $47 million for improving learning outcomes in Asia. Asia is doing very well with learning. You know what we're doing? We should use it ourselves. And $101 million for DEI contracts at the Department of Education, the most ever paid, nothing even like it. Under the Trump Administration, all of these scams-and there are far worse, but I didn't think it was appropriate to talk about them, they're so bad-many more have been found out and exposed and swiftly terminated by a group of very intelligent, mostly young people, headed up by Elon. We appreciate it. We found hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud. And we've taken back the money and reduced our debt to fight inflation and other things. Taken back a lot of that money, we got it just in time.\n\nThis is just the beginning. The Government Accountability Office, a federal government office, has estimated annual fraud of over $500 billion in our nation, and we are working very hard to stop it. We're going to. We're also identifying shocking levels of incompetence and probable fraud in the Social Security program for our seniors, and that our seniors and people that we love rely on. Believe it or not, government databases list 4.7 million Social Security members from people aged 100 to 109 years old. It lists 3.6 million people from ages 110 to 119. I don't know any of them-I know some people that are rather elderly, but not quite that elderly. 3.47 million people from ages 120 to 129. 3.9 million people from ages 130 to 139. 3.5 million people from ages 140 to 149. And money is being paid to many of them, and we're searching right now. In fact, Pam [Bondi], good luck, good luck. You're going to find it. But a lot of money is paid out to people because it just keeps getting paid and paid, and nobody does. And it really hurts Social Security and hurts our country. 1.3 million people from ages 150 to 159. And over 130,000 people, according to the Social Security databases, are aged over 160 years old. We have a healthier country than I thought, Bobby [Kennedy Jr.].\n\nIncluding-to finish-1039 people between the ages of 220 and 229. One person between the age of 240 and 249 and one person is listed at 360 years of age-more than 100 years, more than 100 years older than our country. But we're going to find out where that money is going, and it's not going to be pretty. By slashing all of the fraud, waste and theft we can find, we will defeat inflation, bring down mortgage rates, lower car payments and grocery prices, protect our seniors and put more money in the pockets of American families.\n\nAnd today, interest rates took a beautiful drop. Big, beautiful drop. It's about time. And in the near future, I want to do what has not been done in 24 years: balance the federal budget. We're going to balance it.\n\nWith that goal in mind, we have developed in great detail what we are calling the \"gold card\" which goes on sale very, very soon. For $5 million, we will allow the most successful job-creating people from all over the world to buy a path to U.S. citizenship. It's like the green card, but better and more sophisticated. And these people will have to pay tax in our country. They won't have to pay tax from where they came. The money that they've made. You wouldn't want to do that. But they have to pay tax, create jobs. They'll also be taking people out of colleges and paying for them so that we can keep them in our country, instead of having them be-being forced out. Number one at the top school as an example, being forced out and not being allowed to stay and create tremendous numbers of jobs in great success for a company out there.\n\nSo while we take out the criminals, killers, traffickers and child predators who are allowed to enter our country under the open-border policy of these people, the Democrats, the Biden Administration, the open border, insane policies that you've allowed to destroy our country, we will now bring in brilliant, hardworking, job-creating people. They're going to pay a lot of money, and we're going to reduce our debt with that money.\n\nAmericans have given us a mandate for bold and profound change. For nearly 100 years, the federal bureaucracy has grown until it has crushed our freedoms, ballooned our deficits and held back America's potential in every possible way. The nation founded by pioneers and risktakers now drowns under millions and millions of pages of regulations and debt. Approvals that should take 10 days to get instead, take 10 years, 15 years and even 20 years before you reject it. Meanwhile, we have hundreds of thousands of federal workers who have not been showing up to work. My administration will reclaim power from this unaccountable bureaucracy, and we will restore true democracy to America again.\n\nAnd any federal bureaucrat who resists this change will be removed from office immediately, because we are draining the swamp. It's very simple. And the days of rule by unelected bureaucrats are over.\n\nAnd the next phase of our plan to deliver the greatest economy in history is for this Congress to pass tax cuts for everybody. They're in there. They're waiting for you to vote. And I'm sure that the people on my right, I don't mean the Republican right, but my right, right here [ points to Democrats ], I'm sure you're going to vote for those tax cuts. Because otherwise, I don't believe the people will ever vote you into office. So I'm doing a big favor by telling you that. But I know this group is going to be voting for the tax.\n\nThank you. It's a very, very big part of our plan. We had tremendous success in our first term with it. A very big part of our plan. We're seeking permanent income tax cuts all across the board, and to get urgently needed relief to Americans hit especially hard by inflation. I'm calling for no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on Social Security benefits for our great seniors. And I also want to make interest payments on car loans tax-deductible, but only if the car is made in America.\n\nAnd by the way, we're gonna have growth in the auto industry like nobody's ever seen. Plants are opening up all over the place. Deals are being made, never seen. That's a combination of the election win and tariffs. It's a beautiful word, isn't it? That along with our other policies will allow our auto industry to absolutely boom. It's gonna boom. Spoke to the majors today, all three, the top people and they're so excited. In fact, already, numerous car companies have announced that they will be building massive automobile plants in America with Honda just announcing a new plant in Indiana, one of the largest anywhere in the world.\n\nAnd this has taken place since our great victory on November 5th, a date which will hopefully go down as one of the most important in the history of our country. In addition, as part of our tax cuts, we want to cut taxes on domestic production and all manufacturing. And just as we did before, we will provide 100% expensing. It will be retroactive to January 20th, 2025. And it was one of the main reasons why our tax cuts were so successful in our first term, giving us the most successful economy in the history of our country. First term. We had a great first term.\n\nIf you don't make your product in America, however, under the Trump Administration, you'll pay a tariff and in some cases, a rather large one. Other countries have used tariffs against us for decades, and now it's our turn to start using them against those other countries. On average, the European Union, China, Brazil, India, Mexico, and Canada-have you heard of them?-and countless other nations charge us tremendously higher tariffs than we charge them. It's very unfair. India charges us auto tariffs higher than 100%. China's average tariff on our products is twice what we charge them. And South Korea's average tariff is four times higher. Think of that: four times higher. And we give so much help militarily and in so many other ways to South Korea. But that's what happens. This is happening by friend and foe. This system is not fair to the United States and never was. And so on April 2nd-I wanted to make it April 1st, but I didn't want to be accused of April Fool's Day. That's what that's not. Just one day was... Cost us a lot of money, but we're going to do it in April. I'm a very superstitious person. April 2nd, reciprocal tariffs kick in and whatever they tariff us, other countries, we will tariff them. That's reciprocal-back and forth. Whatever they tax us, we will tax them.\n\nIf they do non-monetary tariffs to keep us out of their market, then we will do non-monetary barriers to keep them out of our market. There's a lot of that too. They don't even allow us in their market. We will take in trillions and trillions of dollars and create jobs like we have never seen before. I did it with China and I did it with others and the Biden Administration couldn't do anything about it because it was so much money. They couldn't do anything about it. We have been ripped off for decades by nearly every country on earth. And we will not let that happen any longer.\n\nMuch has been said over the last three months about Mexico and Canada, but we have very large deficits with both of them. But even more importantly, they've allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens and many very young, beautiful people, destroying families. Nobody's ever seen anything like it. They are in effect receiving subsidies of hundreds of billions of dollars. We pay subsidies to Canada and to Mexico of hundreds of billions of dollars. And the United States will not be doing that any longer. We're not gonna do it any longer.\n\nThanks to our \"America First\" policies we're putting into place. We have had $1.7 trillion of new investment in America in just the past few weeks. The combination of the election, and our economic policies-that people of SoftBank, one of the most brilliant anywhere in the world, announced a $200-billion investment. OpenAI and Oracle Larry Ellison announced $500 billion investment, which they wouldn't have done if Kamala [Harris] had won. Apple announced $500-billion investment. Tim Cook called me, he said I cannot spend it fast enough. It's gonna be much higher than that I believe. They'll be building their plants here instead of in China. And just yesterday, Taiwan Semiconductor-the biggest in the world, most powerful in the world, has a tremendous amount, 97% of the market-announced a $165-billion investment to build the most powerful chips on Earth right here in the USA.\n\nAnd we're not giving them any money. [ To Democrats ] Your CHIPS Act is a horrible, horrible thing. We give hundreds of billions of dollars and it doesn't mean a thing. They take our money and they don't spend it. All that meant to them-we're giving them no money. All that was important to them was they didn't want to pay the tariffs. So they came and they're building and many other companies are coming. We don't have to give them money. We just wanna protect our businesses and our people and they will come because they won't have to pay tariffs if they build in America. So it's very amazing. You should get rid of the CHIP Act and whatever's left over, Mr. Speaker, you should use it to reduce debt or any other reason you want to.\n\nOur new trade policy will also be great for the American farmer. I love the farmer, who will now be selling into our home market, the USA, because nobody is gonna be able to compete with you. Because there's goods that come in from other company-countries and companies. They're un-really, really in a bad position in so many different ways. They're uninspected. They may be very dirty and disgusting and they come in and they pour in and they hurt our American farmers. The tariffs will go on agricultural product coming into America and our, our farmers starting on April 2nd-it may be a little bit of an adjustment period. We had that before when I made the deal with China. $50 billion of purchases. And I said, \"Just bear with me.\" And they did. They did. Probably have to bear with me again and this will be even better. That was great. The problem with it was that Biden didn't enforce it. He didn't enforce it. $50 billion of purchases. And we were doing great, but Biden did not enforce it. And it hurt our farmers. But our farmers are gonna have a field day right now. So to our farmers, have a lot of fun. I love you too. I love you too. It's all gonna happen.\n\nAnd I have also imposed a 25% tariff on foreign aluminum, copper, lumber, and steel. Because if we don't have, as an example, steel, and lots of other things, we don't have a military and frankly won't have-we just won't have a country very long. Here today is a proud American steel worker, fantastic person from Decatur, Alabama. Jeff Denard has been working at the same steel plant for 27 years in a job that has allowed him to serve as the captain of his local volunteer fire department, raised seven children with his beautiful wife, Nicole, and over the years provide a loving home for more than 40 foster children. So great Jeff. Thank you Jeff. Thank you Jeff.\n\nStories like Jeff's remind us that tariffs are not just about protecting American jobs, they're about protecting the soul of our country. Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again. And it's happening and it will happen rather quickly. There'll be a little disturbance, but we are okay with that. It won't be much. [ To Democrats responding in audience ] No, you're not. Oh. And look-and look where Biden took us. Very low, the lowest we've ever been. Jeff, I want to thank you very much.\n\nAnd I also wanna recognize another person who has devoted herself to foster care community. She worked so hard on it. A very loving person, our magnificent First Lady of the United States. Melania's work has yielded incredible results, helping prepare our nation's future leaders as they enter the workforce. Our First Lady is joined by two impressive young women, very impressive. Haley Ferguson, who benefited from the First Lady's Fostering the Future initiative and is poised to complete her education and become a teacher. And Elliston Berry, who became a victim of an illicit deep fake image produced by a peer. With Elliston's help, the Senate just passed the Take It Down Act. And this is so important. Thank you very much, John. John Thune. Thank you. Stand up John. Thank you John. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you. And thank you to John Thune and the Senate. Great job to criminalize the publication of such images online. It's terrible... terrible thing. And once it passes the House, I look forward to signing that bill into law. Thank you. And I'm gonna use that bill for myself too, if you don't mind. 'Cause nobody gets treated worse than I do online-nobody. That's great. Thank you very much to the Senate. Thank you.\n\nBut if we truly care about protecting Americans' children, no step is more crucial than securing America's borders. Over the past four years, 21 million people poured into the United States. Many of them were murderers, human traffickers, gang members, and other criminals from the streets of dangerous cities all throughout the world 'cause of Joe Biden's insane and very dangerous open border policies. They're now strongly embedded in our country, but we are getting them out and getting them out fast. And I wanna thank Tom Homan and Kristi [Noem], I wanna thank you and Paul [Perez] of Border Patrol. I want to thank you. What a job they've all done. Everybody. Border Patrol, ICE, law enforcement in general is incredible. We have to take care of our law enforcement. Have to.\n\nLast year, a brilliant 22-year-old nursing student named Laken Riley, the best in her class, admired by everybody, went out for a jog on the campus of the University of Georgia. That morning, Laken was viciously attacked, assaulted, beaten, brutalized, and horrifically murdered. Laken was stolen from us by a savage, illegal alien gang member who was arrested while trespassing across Biden's open southern border and then set loose into the United States under the heartless policies of that failed administration. It was indeed a failed administration. He had then been arrested and released in a Democrat-run sanctuary city, a disaster, before ending the life of this beautiful young angel. With us this evening, our Laken's beloved mother Allyson and her sister Lauren. Last year, I told Laken's grieving parents that we would ensure their daughter would not have died in vain. That's why the very first bill I signed into law as your 47th President, mandates the detention of all dangerous criminal aliens who threaten public safety. It's a very strong, powerful act. It's called the Laken Riley Act. So Allyson and Lauren, America will never ever forget our beautiful Laken Hope Riley. Thank you very much.\n\nSince taking office, my administration has launched the most sweeping border and immigration crackdown in American history. And we quickly achieved the lowest numbers of illegal border crosses ever recorded. Thank you. The media and our friends in the Democrat party kept saying we needed new legislation, we must have legislation to secure the border. But it turned out that all we really needed was a new President.\n\nThank you. Joe Biden didn't just open our borders-he flew illegal aliens over them to overwhelm our schools, hospitals and communities throughout the country. Entire towns like Aurora, Colorado, and Springfield, Ohio buckled under the weight of the migrant occupation and corruption like nobody's ever seen before. Beautiful towns destroyed. Now just as I promised in my inaugural address, we are achieving the great liberation of America. But there still is much work to be done.\n\nHere tonight is a woman I have gotten to know: Alexis Nungaray from Houston. Wonderful woman. Last June, Alexis's 12-year-old daughter, her precious Jocelyn, walked to a nearby convenience store. She was kidnapped, tied up, assaulted for two hours under a bridge and horrifically murdered. Arrested, and charged with this heinous crime are two illegal alien monsters from Venezuela released into America by the last administration through their ridiculous open border. The death of this beautiful 12-year-old girl and the agony of her mother and family touched our entire nation greatly.\n\nAlexis, I promised that we would always remember your daughter, your magnificent daughter. And earlier tonight I signed an order keeping my word to you. One thing I have learned about Jocelyn is that she loved animals so much. She loved nature. Across Galveston Bay, from where Jocelyn lived in Houston, you'll find a magnificent national wildlife refuge, a pristine, peaceful 34,000-acre sanctuary for all of God's creatures on the edge of the \"Gulf of America.\" Alexis, moments ago, I formally renamed that refuge in loving memory of your beautiful daughter Jocelyn. So Mr. Vice President, if you would, may I have the order. [ shows the Executive Order to Congress. ]\n\nThank you very much. All three savages charged with Jocelyn and Laken's murders were members of the Venezuelan prison gang, the toughest gang, they say, in the world known as Tren de Aragua . Two weeks ago I officially designated this gang along with MS-13 and the blood-thirsty Mexican drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. They are now officially in the same category as ISIS and that's not good for them. Countless thousands of these terrorists were welcomed into the U.S. by the Biden Administration, but now every last one will be rounded up and forcibly removed from our country. Or if they're too dangerous, put in jails standing trial in this country-'cause we don't want them to come back ever.\n\nWith us this evening is a warrior on the frontlines of that battle: Border Patrol agent Roberto Ortiz. Great guy. In January, Roberto and another agent were patrolling by the Rio Grande near an area known as Cartel Island. Doesn't sound too nice to me. When heavily armed gunmen started shooting at them, Roberto saw that his partner was totally exposed, great danger, and he leapt into action returning fire and providing crucial seconds for his fellow agent to seek safety just and just barely. I have some of the prints of that event and it was not good. Agent Ortiz, we salute you for your great courage and uh, for your line of fire that you took and for the bravery that you showed, we honor you and we will always honor you. Thank you, Roberto, very much. Thank you Roberto. And I actually got to know him on my many calls to the border. He's a great, great gentleman.\n\nThe territory to the immediate south of our border is now dominated entirely by criminal cartels that murder, rape, torture, and exercise total control. They have total control over a whole nation, posing a grave threat to our national security. The cartels are waging war in America and it's time for America to wage war on the cartels, which we're doing.\n\nFive nights ago, Mexican authorities, because of our tariff policies being imposed on them-think of this-handed over to us 29 of the biggest cartel leaders in their country. That has never happened before. They wanna make us happy. First time ever. But we need Mexico and Canada to do much more than they've done. And they have to stop the fentanyl and drugs pouring into the USA, they're gonna stop it. I have sent Congress a detailed funding request laying out exactly how we will eliminate these threats to protect our homeland and complete the largest deportation operation in American history, larger even than current record holder President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a moderate man, but someone who believed very strongly in borders. Americans expect Congress to send me this funding without delay so I can sign it into law. So Mr. Speaker, John Thune, both of you, I-I hope you're gonna be able to do that. Mr. Speaker, thank you. Mr. Leader, thank you. Thank you very much and let's get it to me. I'll sign it so fast, you won't even believe it.\n\nAnd as we reclaim our sovereignty, we must also bring back law and order to our cities and towns. In recent years, our justice system has been turned upside down by radical left lunatics, many jurisdictions virtually seized, enforcing the law against dangerous repeat offenders while weaponizing law enforcement against political opponents like me. My administration has acted swiftly and decisively to restore fair, equal, and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law, starting at the FBI and the DOJ. Pam, good luck. Kash [Patel], wherever you may be. Good luck. Good luck, Pam Bondi. Good luck. So important. Gonna do a great job. Kash, thank you. Thank you, Kash. They've already started very strong. They're going to do a fantastic job. You're gonna be very proud of them.\n\nWe're also, once again, giving our police officers the support, protection and respect they so dearly deserve. They have to get it. They have such a hard, dangerous job, but we're gonna make it less dangerous. The problem is the bad guys don't respect the law, but they're starting to respect it and they soon will respect it. This also includes our great fire departments throughout the country. Our firemen and women are unbelievable people and I will never forget them. And besides that, they voted for me in record numbers so I have no choice.\n\nOne year ago this month, 31-year-old New York police officer, Jonathan Diller, unbelievably wonderful person and a great officer, was gunned down at a traffic stop on Long Island. I went to his funeral. The vicious criminal charged with his murder, had 21 prior arrests-and they were rough arrests too. He was a real bad one-The thug in the seat next to him had 14 prior arrests and went by the name of Killer. He was \"Killer.\" He killed other people, they say, a lot of them. I attended Officer Diller's service and when I met his wife and 1-year-old son Ryan, it was very inspirational actually. His widow's name is Stephanie and she is here tonight. Stephanie, thank you very much, Stephanie. Thank you.\n\nStephanie, we're going to make sure that Ryan knows his dad was a true hero-New York's finest. And we are going to get these cold-blooded killers and repeat offenders off our streets. And we're gonna do it fast. Gotta stop it. They get out with 28 arrests, they push people into subway trains, they hit people over the head, back of the head with baseball bats. We gotta get 'em outta here. I have already signed an Executive Order requiring a mandatory death penalty for anyone who murders a police officer. And tonight I'm asking Congress to pass that policy into permanent law.\n\nI'm also asking for a new crime bill getting tough on repeat offenders while enhancing protections for America's police officers so they can do their jobs without fear of their lives being totally destroyed. They don't wanna be killed. We're not gonna let 'em be killed. [ Uproar in audience ]\n\nJoining us in the gallery tonight is a young man who truly loves our police. His name is DJ Daniel. He is 13 years old and he has always dreamed of becoming a police officer. But in 2018, DJ was diagnosed with brain cancer. The doctors gave him five months at most to live. That was more than six years ago. Since that time, DJ and his dad have been on a quest to make his dream come true. And DJ has been sworn in as an honorary law enforcer-officer, actually a number of times. The police love him. The police departments love him. And tonight DJ, we're going to do you the biggest honor of them all. I am asking our new Secret Service director, Sean Curran, to officially make you an agent of the United States Secret Service.\n\n[ Chamber chants: DJ! DJ! ]\n\nThank you DJ. DJ's doctors believe his cancer likely came from a chemical he was exposed to when he was younger. Since 1975, rates of child cancer have increased by more than 40%. Reversing this trend is one of the top priorities for our new presidential commission to make America healthy again chaired by our new Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. With the name Kennedy, you would've thought everybody over here [ pointing to Democrats ] would've been cheering. How quickly they forget. Our goal is to get toxins out of our environment, poisons out of our food supply, and keep our children healthy and strong. As an example, not long ago, and you can't even believe these numbers, one in 10,000 children had autism-one in 10,000-and now it's one in 36. There's something wrong. One in 36, think of that. So we're gonna find out what it is. And there's nobody better than Bobby and all of the people that are working with you. You have the best two, uh, figure out what is going on. Okay, Bobby, good luck. It's a very important job. Thank you. Good job.\n\nThank you. My administration is also working to protect our children from toxic ideologies in our schools. A few years ago, January Littlejohn and her husband discovered that their daughter's school had secretly socially transitioned their 13-year-old little girl. Teachers and administrators conspired to deceive January and her husband while encouraging their daughter to use a new name and pronouns. \"They/them\" pronoun, actually, all without telling January, who is here tonight and is now a courageous advocate against this form of child abuse. January, thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Stories like this are why shortly after taking office, I signed an Executive Order banning public schools from indoctrinating our children with transgender ideology. I also signed an order to cut off all taxpayer funding to any institution that engages in the sexual mutilation of our youth. And now I want Congress to pass a bill permanently banning and criminalizing sex changes on children-and forever ending the lie that any child is trapped in the wrong body. This is a big lie.\n\nAnd our message to every child in America is that you are perfect, exactly the way God made you.\n\n'Cause we're getting wokeness out of our schools and out of our military, and it's already out and it's out of our society. We don't want it. Wokeness is trouble. Wokeness is bad. It's gone. It's gone. And we feel so much better for it. Don't we? Don't we feel better? Our service members won't be activists and ideologues-they will be fighters and warriors. They will fight for our country. And Pete, congratulations, Secretary of Defense, congratulations. And he's not big into the woke movement, I can tell you. I know him well. I am pleased to report that in January the U.S. Army had its single best recruiting month in 15 years. And that all armed services are having among the best recruiting results ever in the history of our services. What a difference.\n\nAnd you know, it was just a few months ago where the results were exactly the opposite. We couldn't recruit anywhere. We couldn't recruit. Now we're having the best results, just about that we've ever had. What a tremendous turnaround. It's really a beautiful thing to see. People love our country again. It's very simple. They love our country and they love being in our military again. So it's a great thing. And thank you very much. Great job.\n\nWe're joined tonight by a young man, Jason Hartley, who knows the weight of that call of duty. Jason's father, grandfather, and great-grandfather all wore the uniform. Jason tragically lost his dad, who was also a Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputy when he was just a boy. And now he wants to carry on the family legacy of service. Jason is a senior in high school, a six letter varsity athlete, a really good athlete-they say, a brilliant student with a 4.46-that's good-GPA. And his greatest dream is to attend the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. And Ja-Jason, that's a very big deal getting in, that's a hard one to get into, but I'm pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted. You'll soon be joining the Corps of Cadets. Thank you Jason. You're gonna be on the long gray line. Jason.\n\nAs Commander-in-Chief, my focus is on building the most powerful military of the future. As a first step, I'm asking Congress to fund a state-of-the-art Golden Dome Missile Defense Shield to protect our homeland-all made in the USA.\n\nAnd Ronald Reagan wanted to do it long ago, but the technology just wasn't there. Not even close. But now we have the technology, it's incredible actually. And other places, ha, they have it. Israel has it, other places have it. And the United States should have it too, right, Tim? Right? They should have it too. So I want to thank you, but it's a very, very important-this is a very dangerous world. We should have it. We want to be protected and we're going to protect our citizens like never before.\n\nTo boost our defense industrial base, we are also going to resurrect the American ship building industry, including commercial ship building and military ship building. And for that purpose, I'm announcing tonight that we will create a new office of ship building in the White House and offer special tax incentives to bring this industry home to America where it belongs. We used to make so many ships, we don't make 'em any more very much, but we're gonna make them very fast very soon. It will have a huge impact.\n\nTo further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal. And we've already started doing it. Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal, and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals. The Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others, but others could use it. But it was built at tremendous cost of American blood and treasure-38,000 workers died building the Panama Canal. They died of malaria, they died of snake bites and mosquitoes. Not a nice place to work. They paid them very highly to go there, knowing there was a 25% chance that they would die. The most expensive project, also, that was ever built in our country's history, if you bring it up to modern day costs. It was given away by the Carter administration for $1. But that agreement has been violated very severely. We didn't give it to China, we gave it to Panama, and we're taking it back.\n\nAnd we have Marco Rubio in charge. Good luck, Marco. Now, we know who to blame if anything goes wrong. No, Marco's been amazing and he's gonna do a great job. Think of it. He got a hundred votes. You know, he was approved with actually 99, but the 100th was this gentleman [ points to Vice President J.D. Vance ] and I feel very certain. So let's assume he got a hundred votes. And I'm either very, very happy about that or I'm very concerned about it. But he's already proven-I mean, he's a great gentleman. He's respected by everybody. And we appreciate you voting for Marco. He's gonna do a fantastic job. Thank you. Thank you. He's doing a great job. Great job.\n\nAnd I also have a message tonight for the incredible people of Greenland: we strongly support your right to determine your own future. And if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America. We need Greenland for national security and even international security. And we're working with everybody involved to try and get it. But we need it, really, for international world security. And I think we're gonna get it-one way or the other, we're gonna get it. We will keep you safe, we will make you rich, and together, we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before. It's a very small population, but very, very large piece of land and very, very important for military security.\n\nAmerica is once again standing strong against the forces of radical Islamic terrorism. Three and a half years ago, ISIS terrorists killed 13 American service members and countless others in the Abbey Gate bombing during the disastrous and incompetent withdrawal from Afghanistan. Not that they were withdrawing, it was the way they withdrew-perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country. Tonight, I am pleased to announce that we have just apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity. And he is right now on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice.\n\nAnd I want to thank especially the government of Pakistan for helping arrest this monster. This was a very momentous day for those 13 families who I actually got to know very well-most of them. Whose children were murdered, and the many people that were so badly-over 42 people so badly injured on that fateful day in Afghanistan. What a horrible day. Such incompetence was shown, that when Putin saw what happened, I guess he said, \"Wow, maybe this is my chance.\" That's how bad it was. Should have never happened. Grossly incompetent people. I spoke to many of the parents and loved ones and they're all in our hearts tonight. Just spoke to 'em on the phone. We had a big call, every one of them called and everybody was on the line and they did nothing but cry with happiness. They were very happy, as happy as you can be under those circumstances. Their child, brother, sister, son, daughter was killed for no reason whatsoever.\n\nIn the Middle East, we're bringing back our hostages from Gaza. In my first term, we achieved one of the most groundbreaking peace agreements in generations, the Abraham Accords, and now we're going to build on that foundation to create a more peaceful and prosperous future for the entire region. A lot of things are happening in the Middle East. People have been talking about that so much lately with everything going on with Ukraine and Russia. But a lot of things are happening in the Middle East. Rough neighborhood, actually.\n\nI'm also working tirelessly to end the savage conflict in Ukraine. Millions of Ukrainians and Russians have been needlessly killed or wounded in this horrific and brutal conflict with no end in sight. The United States has sent hundreds of billions of dollars to support Ukraine's defense with no security, with no anything. Do you want to keep it going for another five years? Yeah. Yeah. You, you would say. Pocahontas says yes.\n\nTwo thousand people are being killed every single week. More than that. They're Russian young people. They're Ukrainian young people. They're not Americans. But I want it to stop. Meanwhile, Europe has sadly spent more money buying Russian oil and gas than they have spent on defending Ukraine by far. Think of that. They've spent more buying Russian oil and gas than they have defending, and we've spent perhaps $350 billion-like taking candy from a baby, that's what happened-and they've spent $100 billion. What a difference that is. And we have an ocean separating us and they don't. But we're getting along very well with them and lots of good things are happening.\n\nBiden has authorized more money in this fight than Europe has spent by billions and billions of dollars. It's hard to believe that they wouldn't have stopped it and said at some point. \"Come on, let's equalize. You gotta be equal to us.\" But that didn't happen. Earlier today. I received an important letter from President Zelensky of Ukraine. The letter reads, \"Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians.\" He said, \"My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to get a peace that lasts. We do really value how much America has done to help Ukraine, maintained its sovereignty and independence. Regarding the agreement on minerals and security, Ukraine is ready to sign it at any time that is convenient for you.\" I appreciate that he sent this letter. Just got it a little while ago.\n\nSimultaneously, we've had serious discussions with Russia and have received strong signals that they are ready for peace. Wouldn't that be beautiful? Wouldn't that be beautiful? Wouldn't that be beautiful?\n\nIt's time to stop this madness. It's time to halt the killing. It's time to end the senseless war. If you want to end wars, you have to talk to both sides. Nearly four years ago, amid rising tensions, a history teacher named Marc Fogel was detained in Russia and sentenced to 14 years in a penal colony. Rough stuff. The previous administration barely lifted a finger to help him. They knew he was innocent, but they had no idea where to begin. But last summer, I promised his 95-year-old mother, Malphine, that we would bring her boy safely back home. After 22 days in office, I did just that, and they are here tonight. To Marc and his great mom, we are delighted to have you safe and sound and with us.\n\nAs fate would have it, Marc Fogel was born in a small rural town in Butler, Pennsylvania-Have you heard of it?-Where his mother has lived for the past 78 years. I just happened to go there last July 13th for a rally. That was not pleasant. And that is where I met his beautiful mom right before I walked onto that stage. And I told her I would not forget what she said about her son. And I never did, did I, never forgot. Less than 10 minutes later, at that same rally, gunfire rang out and a sick and deranged assassin unloaded eight bullets from his sniper's perch into a crowd of many thousands of people. My life was saved by a fraction of an inch, but some were not so lucky.\n\nCorey Comperatore was a firefighter, a veteran, a Christian, a husband, a devoted father, and above all, a protector. When the sound of gunshots pierced the air-was a horrible sound-Corey knew instantly what it was and what to do. He threw himself on top of his wife and daughters and shielded them from the bullets with his own body. Corey was hit really hard. You know the story from there: he sacrificed his life to save theirs. Two others, very fine people, were also seriously hit. But thankfully, with the help of two great country doctors, we thought they were gone and they were saved. So those doctors had great talent. We're joined by Corey's wife, Helen, who was his high school sweetheart, and their two beloved daughters, Allyson and Kaylee. Thank you.\n\nTo Helen, Allyson and Kaylee, Corey is looking down on his three beautiful ladies right now, and he's cheering you on. He loves you. He's cheering you on. Corey was taken from us much too soon, but his destiny was to leave us all with a shining example of the selfless devotion of a true American patriot. It was love like Corey's that built our country and it's love like Corey's that is going to make our country more majestic than ever before. I believe that my life was saved that day in Butler for a very good reason. I was saved by God to make America great again. I believe that. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.\n\nFrom the patriots of Lexington and Concord to the heroes of Gettysburg and Normandy, from the warriors who crossed the Delaware to the trailblazers who climbed the Rockies, and from the legends who soared at Kitty Hawk to the astronauts who touched the moon, Americans have always been the people who defied all arts, transcended all dangers, made the most extraordinary sacrifices, and did whatever it took to defend our children, our country, and our freedom. And as we have seen in this chamber tonight, that same strength, faith, love, and spirit is still alive and thriving in the hearts of the American people. Despite the best efforts of those who would try to censor us, silence us, break us, destroy us, Americans are today a proud, free, sovereign, and independent nation that will always be free and we will fight for it till death. We will never let anything happen to our beloved country.\n\n'Cause we are a country of doers, dreamers, fighters, and survivors. Our ancestors crossed a vast ocean, strode into the unknown wilderness, and carve their fortunes from the rock and soil of a perilous and very dangerous frontier. They chased our destiny across a boundless continent. They built the railroads, laid the highways, and graced the world with American marvels like the Empire State Building, the mighty Hoover Dam and the towering Golden Gate Bridge. They lit the world with electricity, broke free of the force of gravity, fired up the engines of American industry, vanquished the Communists, fascists and Marxists all over the world, and gave us countless modern wonders sculpted out of iron, glass, and steel. We stand on the shoulders of these pioneers who won and built the modern age, these workers who poured their sweat into the skylines of our cities, these warriors who shed their blood on fields of battle and gave everything they had for our rights and for our freedom.\n\nNow it is our time to take up the righteous cause of American liberty, and it is our turn to take America's destiny into our own hands and begin the most thrilling days in the history of our country. This will be our greatest era.\n\nWith God's help over the next four years, we are going to lead this nation even higher and we are going to forge the freest, most advanced, most dynamic, and most dominant civilization ever to exist on the face of this earth. We are going to create the highest quality of life, build the safest and wealthiest and healthiest and most vital communities anywhere in the world. We are going to conquer the vast frontiers of science, and we are going to lead humanity into space and plant the American flag on the planet Mars and even far beyond.

      "text": "'Make America High Again' and 279 Other Ways People Are Ripping Off Trump's Campaign Slogan\n\nO n Nov. 19, 2012 - two weeks after Mitt Romney lost the presidential election to Barack Obama - a non-profit named Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. submitted a trademark application for the phrase \"Make America Great Again.\" According to the Washington Post , Trump says he dreamt up the phrase the day after Romney's loss , unaware that Ronald Reagan had used a nearly identical slogan in 1980.\n\nSince Trump submitted that trademark, which was approved, there have been at least 280 applications for phrases resembling his core campaign slogan - everything from \"Make America Sane Again\" to \"Make Our Planet Great Again,\" both of which are pending approval. All told, 42 have been approved, 64 rejected or withdrawn, and the rest are awaiting a verdict from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. You can browse through them all below:\n\nAbout half of the applications take the form of \"Make [Something] Great Again\" while most of the rest take the form \"Make America [Some Adjective] Again.\" A final 35 modify both variables, such as \"Make Austin Weird Again\" or \"Make Hip-Hop Timeless Again.\"\n\nWhether or not he realized Reagan's campaign had originated the phrase , Trump is not the first person to riff on Reagan's \"Let's Make America Great Again.\" There are two similar trademark applications that predate his by nearly a decade. One is the Mars, Inc. trademark of \"Make Lunch a Meal Again,\" submitted on March 3, 2003, and the other is the phrase \"Make Me Glo Again,\" a sticker that reminds aquarium owners to change the lights, submitted on June 17, 2004. Neither trademark is currently active. In some cases, the applicant submits a screenshot of the product they wish to sell, such as the following:\n\nWhile he claims to have invented the phrase, Trump has very rarely attempted to prevent others from improvising on it. There are only two instances in which his organization has opposed an attempt to copyright the exact same phrase, one of which they abandoned, allowing a trademark to go through for \"Make America Great Again\" lighters .\n\nWhen one submits a trademark application, it is assigned an examining attorney who looks for any conflict, including a search of existing, active trademarks and a basic Google search, says trademark expert Josh Gerben of the Gerben Law Firm . \"If they find a particular name or phrase is a popular meme, they can deny the application for failing to function as a trademark,\" he said. The standard for whether an application is approved, Gerben said, is \"whether the consumer would be confused about the source of the product.\"\n\nThe examiners \"are not taking any overly aggressive approach here,\" Gerben said of the improvisations on \"Make America Great Again.\" To his point, most of the rejected applications were nullified by failures on the part of the applicant to cooperate with the bureaucracy in a timely fashion. Still, there's some inconsistency in whether the examining attorney allows a similar phrase to go through. One attempt to trademark \"Make America America Again \" was rejected for its similarity to Trump's slogan, while a brand of cheese graters with the moniker \"Make America Grate Again\" appears to be poised for approval .\n\nMeanwhile, Gerben notes that it is not permissible to trademark a phrase that references a living person, leading to many rejected applications for phrases like \"Dudes for Donald.\"\n\nDesign by Robin Muccari\n\nWrite to Chris Wilson at chris.wilson@time.com"

      "text": "A Defiant Donald Trump Enters the Arena for Another Fight\n\nD onald Trump stood alone on a long stage in the white-and-gold ballroom at Mar-a-Lago, hands gripping both sides of the lectern, head tilted to one side. An aide had slapped the freshly minted blue sign onto the stand shortly before he took the stage: TRUMP. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 2024.\n\n\"This is an elegant night, an elegant place,\" Trump reflected, face arranged in a disapproving frown. Too elegant, he hinted, for the vulgar things he might have liked to say, the things he was really thinking. \"I am not going to use the word fake news ,\" he said. \"We're going to keep it very elegant.\"\n\nSay what you will about Donald Trump, the man is not a quitter, even when nearly everyone might wish him to be. His advisers had counseled him not to make this speech-not while his party was still licking its wounds from the last disappointing election, not while the GOP was still trying to win one last Senate runoff in Georgia. So eager was Trump to be a candidate again that he nearly pulled the trigger before last Tuesday's midterms. The sun had long since set by the time he took the stage, palm fronds waving invisibly in the humid dark outside the Florida-rococo auditorium, to make his anticlimactic announcement: that he would seek the presidency for the third time.\n\nHe did so with an air of joyless near-resignation, jaw clenched, glaring at the teleprompters as if they'd done him some unforgivable wrong. Just two years after he'd departed the White House, the country, he said, was in terrible shape. \"Under our leadership, we were a great and glorious nation-something you haven't heard for a long period of time,\" he said. At times he seemed not to be paying close attention to the words he reeled off in his singsongy prompter voice, as when he claimed that, as president, he'd gone \"decades\" without being involved in any wars. (Trump was president for four years, and he did not succeed in ending the war in Afghanistan.)\n\nHe did so in near-isolation: though the ballroom was filled with the usual Trumpian menagerie of sycophants and hangers on, from the \"Front Row Joes\" who camp out at his rallies to former senior White House officials; the only sitting member of Congress to be seen was Rep. Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina, who lost his primary and moved out of the Capitol months ago. Even Trump superfan Matt Gaetz, the rabble-rousing Florida congressman, decided at the last minute not to show, citing weather conditions apparent to no one else. Melania Trump came out with her husband, looking resort-chic in a polka-dot blouse, but she stood offstage while he spoke. After Trump finished his speech, his daughter Ivanka issued a statement declaring she would not be part of the new campaign.\n\nHe did so a week after an election that had called his standing as god-emperor of the Republican Party into question like never before. The much-anticipated red wave failed to materialize. Democrats kept the Senate and nearly held onto the House, and many Republicans were blaming Trump, whose handpicked oddballs had been spurned by voters otherwise eager for change. From conservative media to the House and Senate, even once-sympathetic Republicans were lining up to call him a loser and openly soliciting new leadership.\n\nTrump, as he always has, stood defiant, one man against the world. The establishment could wish all it wanted that he would disappear, but he'd never consent to that. Outside the ballroom, the world was falling apart on multiple levels. With the GOP and Twitter and crypto all imploding at once, a cosmic reshuffling seemed under way. These are the moments Trump has always seized: the every-man-for-himself times, the instances of maximum chaos and disarray, the points at which sensible people run for shelter-the moments when a leader is needed.\n\nHe came offering the same thing he always has: defiance, hostility, omnidirectional oppositionalism. Once, this was shocking and new, something no one had ever seen before. Once, America was so desperate for something different that even crazy seemed worth giving a chance. In retrospect, those were innocent, boring, indulgent times. We're in a different mood now: \"People are tired of hating each other, of fighting nonstop,\" a former high-ranking Republican official told me, sounding simultaneously vexed and hopeful.\n\nBut Trump is betting there are enough people who still crave his crazed appeal. \"I didn't need this,\" he mused. \"I had a very nice, easy life. This is something I didn't need. A lot of you people don't either! But,\" he said, \"we love our country.\"\n\nTrump has his own explanation for what happened in the midterms: things haven't gotten bad enough. The Biden administration is a catastrophe, but a slow-moving one that has yet to fully manifest in many people's consciousness.\n\n\"Much criticism is being placed on the fact that the Republican Party should have done better, and frankly, much of this blame is correct,\" Trump said. \"But the citizens of our country have not yet realized the full extent and gravity of the pain our nation is going through. The total effect of the suffering is just starting to take hold. They don't quite feel it yet. They will very soon. I have no doubt that by 2024, it will sadly be much worse, and they will see much more clearly what happened and what is happening to our country, and the voting will be much different.\"\n\nYet the Americans who voted a week ago did not seem to be under any illusions about how well things are going. A huge majority told exit pollsters they thought the country was on the wrong track. They dislike the current president, they distrust his management of the economy and public safety, they fear for the future. They just did not see Trump's merry band of reality-resistant nutjobs as an acceptable alternative.\n\nMany otherwise Trump-tolerant Republicans cannot abide losing and are ready to move on. \"He handpicked a number of candidates that proved not to be competitive, and Republicans lost a number of races that, had he not gotten involved, we probably would have won,\" says former Rep. Tom Davis, pointing to Pennsylvania, Arizona, and New Hampshire as examples. \"He's trying to make a party in his own image, but politics is about coalitions. He doesn't play well in the sandbox.\"\n\nIn the hours before Trump spoke, his party was in meltdown mode on Capitol Hill. A week after Election Day, the House GOP leader, Kevin McCarthy, finally saw the majority within his grasp, and was nominated for speaker by his caucus on Tuesday afternoon. But he received only 188 votes of the 218 he will need on the floor in January, facing a burbling conservative insurgency that it's not clear he knows how to tame. In the Senate, meanwhile, GOP leader Mitch McConnell, doomed to remain in the minority, faces a challenge from Senator Rick Scott of Florida that seems unlikely to succeed but will further divide the party's usually cohesive ranks.\n\nTrump, too, faces new challenges. The name on every Republican's lips is Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor whose 20-point landslide last week was a rare highlight for the beleaguered GOP. The New York Post called him \"DeFuture.\" Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming called him \"the current leader of the Republican Party.\" After the election, Trump released a statement tearing into DeSantis, whom he calls \"DeSanctimonious,\" as \"average.\" And later he issued an unprovoked racist broadside against Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin for good measure. In Tuesday's speech, Trump didn't mention any of his potential rivals.\n\nTrump has one obvious advantage over his opponents for the nomination: his army-the hard-core base that would follow him to the ends of the earth, that would even try to overthrow the government if he told them to do it for him. But even that may not last: several new polls show him behind DeSantis among Republican primary voters. In one, a national survey of Republican primary voters conducted after Election Day by the nonpartisan communications firm Seven Letter Insight, DeSantis was the first choice of 34%, ahead of Trump's 26%. That same poll found that 67% of all voters, including 40% of Republicans, think Trump should not run in 2024. Too late.\n\nTrump has something else his competitors don't: his sheer recklessness, his willingness to do or say anything, to destroy anything or anyone in his path to get what he wants. Now he is running again, and to get into the arena, they must get into it with him. He is, once again, the axel around which everything turns.\n\nTrump's advisers are telling reporters that this campaign will be \"lean,\" a slimmed-down, back-to-basics undertaking, more like the wing-and-a-prayer effort of 2016 than the long presidential slog of 2020. As in 2016, Trump wouldn't have to be most voters' favorite candidate to win the party nomination. A fractured field could divide the vote and allow him to win with pluralities.\n\nHis rivals face a conundrum: if they hit back at him, they risk lowering themselves to his level; if they take the high road, they risk leaving him unscathed. His 2016 competitors made both of these mistakes, which suggests there is no right or wrong way for Republicans to beat Trump; there is no way. His former vice president, Mike Pence, who was hounded by a murderous mob egged on by Trump on Jan. 6, released a memoir Tuesday lamenting Trump's \"reckless\" conduct, adding to the pile-on that also includes multiple civil and criminal investigations. \"I'm a victim,\" Trump stopped to observe at one point, but he managed not to go off on one of his extended conspiratorial rants.\n\nWill this really be the end for Trump, after everything else that so many thought should have been but wasn't? \"I feel like there's enough pent-up desire for Republicans to win that they'll say, we can't keep doing this over and over again,\" says David Kochel, an Iowa-based veteran of multiple state and national GOP campaigns. \"But something about Trump just understands how to bring people back to heel. It's his superpower, I guess.\"\n\nIn his protracted announcement speech, which all the cable networks had cut away from long before the hour mark, Trump hit many of the themes of his rallies but stayed more focused than usual on policy. He did not mention the stolen election, the \"Unselect\" Jan. 6 Committee, or the overturning of Roe v. Wade by the Supreme Court he forged-the other big factor stymieing the red wave that wasn't. He focused on trade, China, nuclear weapons, and policing. \"The blood-soaked streets of our once great cities are cesspools of violent crime,\" he said, calling for the swift execution of drug dealers. Trump glowered sullenly throughout. He toggled confusingly between the supposedly golden era of his presidency, the miserable times before that (Obama), the mythical Before Time when America was Great, and the wretched current state of affairs, which he termed \"the pause\"-the miserable interregnum that would send the American electorate rushing back into his arms.\n\n\"From now until Election Day 2024, which will come very quickly-look how time flies!\" Trump said, \"I will fight like no one has ever fought before, and we will defeat the radical left Democrats trying to destroy our country from within.\"\n\nHe is a wounded animal-the most dangerous kind. But for now, he has the field all to himself. If anyone else wants to compete, they will have to enter his arena.\n\nWrite to Molly Ball/Palm Beach, Fla. at molly.ball@time.com"

      "text": "Read Donald Trump's Full Inauguration Speech\n\nDonald Trump delivered his first speech as President of the United States on Friday morning.\n\nTrump was joined at the inauguration by members of his family, including his wife Melania Trump , and his children Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, Ivanka Trump , Tiffany Trump and Barron Trump. Outgoing President Barack Obama, along with former Presidents George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter were also in attendance.\n\nAhead of his speech, Trump aide Kellyanne Conway said the American people could expect Trump's address to be a message to \"unify the country.\" \"You're going to hear a man of action, a man of resolve in what we all know to be a divided country,\" Conway said Friday morning on CBS .\n\nRead the full transcript of his remarks below:\n\n[*] TRUMP: Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans and people of the world, thank you.\n\n(APPLAUSE) We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and restore its promise for all of our people.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTogether, we will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come. We will face challenges, we will confront hardships, but we will get the job done.\n\nEvery four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power, and we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition. They have been magnificent. Thank you.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nToday's ceremony, however, has very special meaning because today, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another, but we are transferring power from Washington, D.C. and giving it back to you, the people.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nFor too long, a small group in our nation's capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost. Washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered, but the jobs left and the factories closed. The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country. Their victories have not been your victories. Their triumphs have not been your triumphs. And while they celebrated in our nation's capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThat all changes starting right here and right now because this moment is your moment, it belongs to you.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTRUMP: It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America. This is your day. This is your celebration. And this, the United States of America, is your country.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWhat truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nJanuary 20th, 2017 will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThe forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nEveryone is listening to you now. You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement, the likes of which the world has never seen before.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAt the center of this movement is a crucial conviction, that a nation exists to serve its citizens. Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves. These are just and reasonable demands of righteous people and a righteous public.\n\nBut for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists: mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge; and the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.\n\nThis American carnage stops right here and stops right now.\n\n(APPLAUSE) We are one nation and their pain is our pain. Their dreams are our dreams. And their success will be our success. We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny. The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nFor many decades, we've enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry; subsidized the armies of other countries, while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military. We've defended other nations' borders while refusing to defend our own.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay. We've made other countries rich, while the wealth, strength and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon.\n\nOne by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions and millions of American workers that were left behind. The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world.\n\nBut that is the past. And now, we are looking only to the future.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTRUMP: We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power. From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this day forward, it's going to be only America first, America first.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nEvery decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families. We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nProtection will lead to great prosperity and strength. I will fight for you with every breath in my body and I will never ever let you down.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAmerica will start winning again, winning like never before.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe will build new roads and highways and bridges and airports and tunnels and railways all across our wonderful nation. We will get our people off of welfare and back to work, rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe will follow two simple rules; buy American and hire American.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world, but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first. We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example. We will shine for everyone to follow.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe will reinforce old alliances and form new ones and unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAt the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other. When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThe bible tells us how good and pleasant it is when God's people live together in unity. We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity. When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThere should be no fear. We are protected and we will always be protected. We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement. And most importantly, we will be protected by God.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTRUMP: Finally, we must think big and dream even bigger. In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving. We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action, constantly complaining, but never doing anything about it.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThe time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nDo not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done. No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America. We will not fail. Our country will thrive and prosper again.\n\nWe stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow. A new national pride will stir ourselves, lift our sights and heal our divisions.\n\nIt's time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget, that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe all enjoy the same glorious freedoms and we all salute the same great American flag.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the wind-swept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty creator.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSo to all Americans in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, from ocean to ocean, hear these words. You will never be ignored again.\n\n(APPLAUSE) Your voice, your hopes, and your dreams will define our American destiny. And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way.\n\nTogether, we will make America strong again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And yes, together we will make America great again.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThank you. God bless you. And God bless America.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThank you.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nGod bless America.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "Read Donald Trump's 'America First' Foreign Policy Speech\n\nR epublican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump outlined an \"America first\" foreign policy approach in what was billed as a major address at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C.\n\nHere is a full transcript of the speech.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to speak to you, and thank you to the Center for National Interest for honoring me with this invitation. It truly is a great honor. I'd like to talk today about how to develop a new foreign policy direction for our country, one that replaces randomness with purpose, ideology with strategy, and chaos with peace.\n\nTRUMP: It's time to shake the rust off America's foreign policy. It's time to invite new voices and new visions into the fold, something we have to do. The direction I will outline today will also return us to a timeless principle. My foreign policy will always put the interests of the American people and American security above all else. It has to be first. Has to be.\n\nThat will be the foundation of every single decision that I will make. America...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAmerica first will be the major and overriding theme of my administration. But to chart our path forward, we must first briefly take a look back. We have a lot to be proud of.\n\nIn the 1940s we saved the world. The greatest generation beat back the Nazis and Japanese imperialists. Then we saved the world again. This time, from totalitarianism and communism. The Cold War lasted for decades but, guess what, we won and we won big. Democrats and Republicans working together got Mr. Gorbachev to heed the words of President Reagan, our great president, when he said, tear down this wall.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nHistory will not forget what he did. A very special man and president. Unfortunately, after the Cold War our foreign policy veered badly off course. We failed to develop a new vision for a new time. In fact, as time went on, our foreign policy began to make less and less sense. Logic was replaced with foolishness and arrogance, which led to one foreign policy disaster after another.\n\nThey just kept coming and coming. We went from mistakes in Iraq to Egypt to Libya, to President Obama's line in the sand in Syria. Each of these actions have helped to throw the region into chaos and gave ISIS the space it needs to grow and prosper. Very bad. It all began with a dangerous idea that we could make western democracies out of countries that had no experience or interests in becoming a western democracy.\n\nWe tore up what institutions they had and then were surprised at what we unleashed. Civil war, religious fanaticism, thousands of Americans and just killed be lives, lives, lives wasted. Horribly wasted. Many trillions of dollars were lost as a result. The vacuum was created that ISIS would fill. Iran, too, would rush in and fill that void much to their really unjust enrichment.\n\nThey have benefited so much, so sadly, for us. Our foreign policy is a complete and total disaster. No vision. No purpose. No direction. No strategy. Today I want to identify five main weaknesses in our foreign policy.\n\nFirst, our resources are totally over extended. President Obama has weakened our military by weakening our economy. He's crippled us with wasteful spending, massive debt, low growth, a huge trade deficit and open borders. Our manufacturing trade deficit with the world is now approaching $1 trillion a year.\n\nWe're rebuilding other countries while weakening our own. Ending the theft of American jobs will give us resources we need to rebuild our military, which has to happen and regain our financial independence and strength. I am the only person running for the presidency who understands this and this is a serious problem.\n\nI'm the only one - believe me, I know them all, I'm the only one who knows how to fix it.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSecondly, our allies are not paying their fair share, and I've been talking about this recently a lot. Our allies must contribute toward their financial, political, and human costs, have to do it, of our tremendous security burden. But many of them are simply not doing so.\n\nTRUMP: They look at the United States as weak and forgiving and feel no obligation to honor their agreements with us. In NATO, for instance, only 4 of 28 other member countries besides America, are spending the minimum required 2 percent of GDP on defense. We have spent trillions of dollars over time on planes, missiles, ships, equipment, building up our military to provide a strong defense for Europe and Asia.\n\nThe countries we are defending must pay for the cost of this defense, and if not, the U.S. must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves. We have no choice.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThe whole world will be safer if our allies do their part to support our common defense and security. A Trump administration will lead a free world that is properly armed and funded, and funded beautifully.\n\nThirdly, our friends are beginning to think they can't depend on us. We've had a president who dislikes our friends and bows to our enemies, something that we've never seen before in the history of our country. He negotiated a disastrous deal with Iran, and then we watched them ignore its terms even before the ink was dry. Iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon, cannot be allowed. Remember that, cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd under a Trump administration, will never, ever be allowed to have that nuclear weapon.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAll of this without even mentioning the humiliation of the United States with Iran's treatment of our ten captured sailors - so vividly I remember that day. In negotiation, you must be willing to walk. The Iran deal, like so many of our worst agreements, is the result of not being willing to leave the table.\n\nWhen the other side knows you're not going to walk, it becomes absolutely impossible to win - you just can't win. At the same time, your friends need to know that you will stick by the agreements that you have with them. You've made that agreement, you have to stand by it and the world will be a better place. President Obama gutted our missile defense program and then abandoned our missile defense plans with Poland and the Czech Republic. He supported the ouster of a friendly regime in Egypt that had a longstanding peace treaty with Israel, and then helped bring the Muslim Brotherhood to power in its place.\n\nIsrael, our great friend and the one true democracy in the Middle East has been snubbed and criticized by an administration that lacks moral clarity. Just a few days ago, Vice President Biden again criticized Israel, a force for justice and peace, for acting as an impatient peace area in the region.\n\nPresident Obama has not been a friend to Israel. He has treated Iran with tender love and care and made it a great power. Iran has, indeed, become a great, great power in just a very short period of time, because of what we've done. All of the expense and all at the expense of Israel, our allies in the region and very importantly, the United States itself.\n\nWe've picked fights with our oldest friends, and now they're starting to look elsewhere for help. Remember that. Not good.\n\nFourth, our rivals no longer respect us. In fact, they're just as confused as our allies, but in an even bigger problem is they don't take us seriously anymore. The truth is they don't respect us. When President Obama landed in Cuba on Air Force One, to leader was there, nobody, to greet him.\n\nPerhaps an incident without precedent in the long and prestigious history of Air Force One. Then amazingly, the same thing happened in Saudi Arabia. It's called no respect. Absolutely no respect.\n\nTRUMP: Do you remember when the president made a long and expensive trip to Copenhagen, Denmark, to get the Olympics for our country, and after this unprecedented effort, it was announced that the United States came in fourth - fourth place? The president of the United States making this trip - unprecedented - comes in fourth place. He should have known the result before making such an embarrassing commitment. We were laughed at all over the world, as we have been many, many times.\n\nThe list of humiliations go on and on and on. President Obama watches helplessly as North Korea increases its aggression and expands further and further with its nuclear reach. Our president has allowed China to continue its economic assault on American jobs and wealth, refusing to enforce trade deals and apply leverage on China necessary to rein in North Korea. We have the leverage. We have the power over China, economic power, and people don't understand it. And with that economic power, we can rein in and we can get them to do what they have to do with North Korea, which is totally out of control.\n\nHe has even allowed China to steal government secrets with cyber attacks and engaged in industrial espionage against the United States and its companies. We've let our rivals and challengers think they can get away with anything, and they do. They do at will. It always happens. If President Obama's goal had been to weaken America, he could not have done a better job.\n\nFinally, America no longer has a clear understanding of our foreign policy goals. Since the end of the Cold War and the breakup of the Soviet Union, we've lacked a coherent foreign policy. One day, we're bombing Libya and getting rid of a dictator to foster democracy for civilians. The next day, we're watching the same civilians suffer while that country falls and absolutely falls apart. Lives lost, massive moneys lost. The world is a different place.\n\nWe're a humanitarian nation, but the legacy of the Obama-Clinton interventions will be weakness, confusion and disarray, a mess. We've made the Middle East more unstable and chaotic than ever before. We left Christians subject to intense persecution and even genocide.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe have done nothing to help the Christians, nothing, and we should always be ashamed for that, for that lack of action. Our actions in Iraq, Libya and Syria have helped unleash ISIS, and we're in a war against radical Islam, but President Obama won't even name the enemy, and unless you name the enemy, you will never ever solve the problem.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nHillary Clinton also refuses to say the words radical Islam, even as she pushes for a massive increase in refugees coming into our country. After Secretary Clinton's failed intervention in Libya, Islamic terrorists in Benghazi took down our consulate and killed our ambassador and three brave Americans. Then, instead of taking charge that night, Hillary Clinton decided to go home and sleep. Incredible.\n\nClinton blames it all on a video, an excuse that was a total lie, proven to be absolutely a total lie. Our ambassador was murdered and our secretary of state misled the nation. And, by the way, she was not awake to take that call at 3 o'clock in the morning. And now ISIS is making millions and millions of dollars a week selling Libya oil. And you know what? We don't blockade, we don't bomb, we don't do anything about it. It's almost as if our country doesn't even know what's happening, which could be a fact and could be true.\n\nTRUMP: This will all change when I become president.\n\nTo our friends and allies, I say America is going to be strong again. America is going to be reliable again. It's going to be a great and reliable ally again. It's going to be a friend again. We're going to finally have a coherent foreign policy based upon American interests and the shared interests of our allies.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe're getting out of the nation-building business and instead focusing on creating stability in the world. Our moments of greatest strength came when politics ended at the water's edge. We need a new rational American foreign policy, informed by the best minds and supported by both parties, and it will be by both parties - Democrats, Republicans, independents, everybody, as well as by our close allies.\n\nThis is how we won the Cold War and it's how we will win our new future struggles, which may be many, which may be complex, but we will win if I become president.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nFirst, we need a long-term plan to halt the spread and reach of radical Islam. Containing the spread of radical Islam must be a major foreign policy goal of the United States and indeed the world. Events may require the use of military force, but it's also a philosophical struggle, like our long struggle in the Cold War.\n\nIn this, we're going to be working very closely with our allies in the Muslim world, all of which are at risk from radical Islamic violence, attacks and everything else. It is a dangerous world, more dangerous now than it has ever been.\n\nWe should work - thank you.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe should work together with any nation in the region that is threatened by the rise of radical Islam. But this has to be a two-way street. They must also be good to us. Remember that. They have to be good to us, no longer one way. It's now two-way. And remember, us and all we're doing, they have to appreciate what we've done to them. We're going to help, but they have to appreciate what we've done for them. The struggle against radical Islam also takes place in our homeland. There are scores of recent migrants inside our borders charged with terrorism. For every case known to the public, there are dozens and dozens more. We must stop importing extremism through senseless immigration policies. We have no idea where these people are coming from. There's no documentation. There's no paperwork. There's nothing. We have to be smart. We have to be vigilant.\n\nA pause for reassessment will help us to prevent the next San Bernardino or frankly, much worse. All you have to do is look at the World Trade Center and September 11th, one of the great catastrophes, in my opinion, the single greatest military catastrophe in the history of our country; worse than Pearl Harbor because you take a look at what's happened, and citizens were attacked, as opposed to the military being attacked - one of the true great catastrophes.\n\nAnd then there's ISIS. I have a simple message for them. Their days are numbered. I won't tell them where and I won't tell them how. We must...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... we must as a nation be more unpredictable. We are totally predictable. We tell everything. We're sending troops. We tell them. We're sending something else. We have a news conference. We have to be unpredictable. And we have to be unpredictable starting now.\n\nBut they're going to be gone. ISIS will be gone if I'm elected president. And they'll be gone quickly. They will be gone very, very quickly.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTRUMP: Secondly, we have to rebuild our military and our economy. The Russians and Chinese have rapidly expanded their military capability, but look at what's happened to us. Our nuclear weapons arsenal, our ultimate deterrent, has been allowed to atrophy and is desperately in need of modernization and renewal. And it has to happen immediately. Our active duty armed forces have shrunk from 2 million in 1991 to about 1.3 million today. The Navy has shrunk from over 500 ships to 272 ships during this same period of time. The Air Force is about one-third smaller than 1991. Pilots flying B-52s in combat missions today. These planes are older than virtually everybody in this room.\n\nAnd what are we doing about this? President Obama has proposed a 2017 defense budget that in real dollars, cuts nearly 25 percent from what we were spending in 2011. Our military is depleted and we're asking our generals and military leaders to worry about global warming.\n\nWe will spend what we need to rebuild our military. It is the cheapest, single investment we can make. We will develop, build and purchase the best equipment known to mankind. Our military dominance must be unquestioned, and I mean unquestioned, by anybody and everybody.\n\nBut we will look for savings and spend our money wisely. In this time of mounting debt, right now we have so much debt that nobody even knows how to address the problem. But I do. No one dollar can be wasted. Not one single dollar can we waste. We're also going to have to change our trade, immigration and economic policies to make our economy strong again. And to put Americans first again.\n\nThis will ensure that our own workers, right here in America, get the jobs and higher pay that will grow our tax revenues, increase our economic might as a nation, make us strong financially again. So, so important. We need to think smart about areas where our technological superiority, and nobody comes close, gives us an edge.\n\nThis includes 3D printing, artificial intelligence and cyber warfare. A great country also takes care of its warriors. Our commitment to them is absolute, and I mean absolute. A trump administration will give our servicemen and women the best equipment and support in the world when they serve and where they serve. And the best care in the world when they return as veterans and they come back home to civilian life. Our veterans...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nOur veterans have not been treated fairly or justly. These are our great people and we must treat them fairly. We must even treat them really, really well and that will happen under the Trump administration.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nFinally, we must develop a foreign policy based on American interests. Businesses do not succeed when they lose sight of their core interests and neither do countries. Look at what happened in the 1990s. Our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania - and this was a horrible time for us - were attacked. and 17 brave sailors were killed on the USS Cole.\n\nAnd what did we do? It seemed we put more effort into adding China into the World Trade organization, which has been a total disaster for the United States. Frankly, we spent more time on that than we did in stopping Al Qaida. We even had an opportunity to take out Osama bin Laden and we didn't do it\n\nAnd then we got hit at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Again, the worst attack on our country in its history. Our foreign policy goals must be based on America's core national security interests. And the following will be my priorities.\n\nIn the Middle East our goals must be, and I mean must be, to defeat terrorists and promote regional stability, not radical change. We need to be clear sighted about the groups that will never be anything other than enemies. And believe me, we have groups that no matter what you do, they will be the enemy.\n\nTRUMP: We have to be smart enough to recognize who those groups are, who those people are, and not help them. And we must only be generous to those that prove they are indeed our friends.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe desire to live peacefully and in friendship with Russia and China. We have serious differences with these two nations, and must regard them with open eyes, but we are not bound to be adversaries. We should seek common ground based on shared interests.\n\nRussia, for instance, has also seen the horror of Islamic terrorism. I believe an easing of tensions, and improved relations with Russia from a position of strength only is possible, absolutely possible. Common sense says this cycle, this horrible cycle of hostility must end and ideally will end soon. Good for both countries.\n\nSome say the Russians won't be reasonable. I intend to find out. If we can't make a deal under my administration, a deal that's great - not good, great - for America, but also good for Russia, then we will quickly walk from the table. It's as simple as that. We're going to find out.\n\nFixing our relations with China is another important step - and really toward creating an even more prosperous period of time. China respects strength and by letting them take advantage of us economically, which they are doing like never before, we have lost all of their respect.\n\nWe have a massive trade deficit with China, a deficit that we have to find a way quickly, and I mean quickly, to balance. A strong and smart America is an America that will find a better friend in China, better than we have right now. Look at what China is doing in the South China Sea. They're not supposed to be doing it.\n\nNo respect for this country or this president. We can both benefit or we can both go our separate ways. If need be, that's what's going to have to happen.\n\nAfter I'm elected president, I will also call for a summit with our NATO allies and a separate summit with our Asian allies. In these summits, we will not only discuss a rebalancing of financial commitments, but take a fresh look at how we can adopt new strategies for tackling our common challenges. For instance, we will discuss how we can upgrade NATO's outdated mission and structure, grown out of the Cold War to confront our shared challenges, including migration and Islamic terrorism.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI will not hesitate to deploy military force when there is no alternative. But if America fights, it must only fight to win.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI will never sent our finest into battle unless necessary, and I mean absolutely necessary, and will only do so if we have a plan for victory with a capital V.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nOur goal is peace and prosperity, not war and destruction. The best way to achieve those goals is through a disciplined, deliberate and consistent foreign policy. With President Obama and Secretary Clinton we've had the exact opposite - a reckless, rudderless and aimless foreign policy, one that has blazed the path of destruction in its wake.\n\nAfter losing thousands of lives and spending trillions of dollars, we are in far worst shape in the Middle East than ever, ever before. I challenge anyone to explain the strategic foreign policy vision of Obama/Clinton. It has been a complete and total disaster.\n\nI will also be prepared to deploy America's economic resources. Financial leverage and sanctions can be very, very persuasive, but we need to use them selectively and with total determination.\n\nTRUMP: Our power will be used if others do not play by the rules. In other words, if they do not treat us fairly. Our friends and enemies must know that if I draw a line in the sand, I will enforce that line in the sand. Believe me.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nHowever, unlike other candidates for the presidency, war and aggression will not be my first instinct. You cannot have a foreign policy without diplomacy. A superpower understands that caution and restraint are really truly signs of strength. Although not in government service, I was totally against the war in Iraq, very proudly, saying for many years that it would destabilize the Middle East. Sadly, I was correct, and the biggest beneficiary has been has been Iran, who is systematically taking over Iraq and gaining access to their very rich oil reserves, something it has wanted to do for decades.\n\nAnd now, to top it off, we have ISIS. My goal is to establish a foreign policy that will endure for several generations. That's why I also look and have to look for talented experts with approaches and practical ideas, rather than surrounding myself with those who have perfect resumes but very little to brag about except responsibility for a long history of failed policies and continued losses at war. We have to look to new people.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe have to look to new people because many of the old people frankly don't know what they're doing, even though they may look awfully good writing in the New York Times or being watched on television.\n\nFinally, I will work with our allies to reinvigorate Western values and institutions. Instead of trying to spread universal values that not everybody shares or wants, we should understand that strengthening and promoting Western civilization and its accomplishments will do more to inspire positive reforms around the world than military interventions.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThese are my goals as president. I will seek a foreign policy that all Americans, whatever their party, can support, so important, and which our friends and allies will respect and totally welcome. The world must know that we do not go abroad in search of enemies, that we are always happy when old enemies become friends and when old friends become allies, that's what we want. We want them to be our allies.\n\nWe want the world to be - we want to bring peace to the world. Too much destruction out there, too many destructive weapons. The power of weaponry is the single biggest problem that we have today in the world.\n\nTo achieve these goals, Americans must have confidence in their country and its leadership. Again, many Americans must wonder why we our politicians seem more interested in defending the borders of foreign countries than in defending their own. Americans...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAmericans must know that we're putting the American people first again on trade.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSo true. On trade, on immigration, on foreign policy. The jobs, incomes and security of the American worker will always be my first priority.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nNo country has ever prospered that failed to put its own interests first. Both our friends and our enemies put their countries above ours and we, while being fair to them, must start doing the same. We will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism. The nation-state remains the true foundation for happiness and harmony. I am skeptical of international unions that tie us up and bring America down and will never enter...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTRUMP: And under my administration, we will never enter America into any agreement that reduces our ability to control our own affairs.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nNAFTA, as an example, has been a total disaster for the United States and has emptied our states - literally emptied our states of our manufacturing and our jobs. And I've just gotten to see it. I've toured Pennsylvania. I've toured New York. I've toured so many of the states. They have been cleaned out. Their manufacturing is gone.\n\nNever again, only the reverse - and I have to say this strongly - never again; only the reverse will happen. We will keep our jobs and bring in new ones. There will be consequences for the companies that leave the United States only to exploit it later. They fire the people. They take advantage of the United States. There will be consequences for those companies. Never again.\n\nUnder a Trump administration, no American citizen will ever again feel that their needs come second to the citizens of a foreign country.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI will view as president the world through the clear lens of American interests. I will be America's greatest defender and most loyal champion. We will not apologize for becoming successful again, but will instead embrace the unique heritage that makes us who we are.\n\nThe world is most peaceful and most prosperous when America is strongest. America will continue and continue forever to play the role of peacemaker. We will always help save lives and indeed humanity itself, but to play the role, we must make America strong again.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd always - always, always, we must make, and we have to look at it from every angle, and we have no choice, we must make America respected again. We must make America truly wealthy again. And we must - we have to and we will make America great again. And if we do that - and if we do that, perhaps this century can be the most peaceful and prosperous the world has ever, ever known. Thank you very much, everybody. I appreciate it. Thank you.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThank you very much.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThank you.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "Here's Donald Trump's Presidential Announcement Speech\n\nWow. Whoa. That is some group of people. Thousands.\n\nSo nice, thank you very much. That's really nice. Thank you. It's great to be at Trump Tower. It's great to be in a wonderful city, New York. And it's an honor to have everybody here. This is beyond anybody's expectations. There's been no crowd like this.\n\nAnd, I can tell, some of the candidates, they went in. They didn't know the air-conditioner didn't work. They sweated like dogs.\n\nThey didn't know the room was too big, because they didn't have anybody there. How are they going to beat ISIS? I don't think it's gonna happen.\n\nOur country is in serious trouble. We don't have victories anymore. We used to have victories, but we don't have them. When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let's say, China in a trade deal? They kill us. I beat China all the time. All the time.\n\nWhen did we beat Japan at anything? They send their cars over by the millions, and what do we do? When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo? It doesn't exist, folks. They beat us all the time.\n\nWhen do we beat Mexico at the border? They're laughing at us, at our stupidity. And now they are beating us economically. They are not our friend, believe me. But they're killing us economically.\n\nThe U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems.\n\nThank you. It's true, and these are the best and the finest. When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\n\nBut I speak to border guards and they tell us what we're getting. And it only makes common sense. It only makes common sense. They're sending us not the right people.\n\nIt's coming from more than Mexico. It's coming from all over South and Latin America, and it's coming probably- probably- from the Middle East. But we don't know. Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don't know what's happening. And it's got to stop and it's got to stop fast.\n\nIslamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East. They've become rich. I'm in competition with them.\n\nThey just built a hotel in Syria. Can you believe this? They built a hotel. When I have to build a hotel, I pay interest. They don't have to pay interest, because they took the oil that, when we left Iraq, I said we should've taken.\n\nSo now ISIS has the oil, and what they don't have, Iran has. And in 19- and I will tell you this, and I said it very strongly, years ago, I said- and I love the military, and I want to have the strongest military that we've ever had, and we need it more now than ever. But I said, \"Don't hit Iraq,\" because you're going to totally destabilize the Middle East. Iran is going to take over the Middle East, Iran and somebody else will get the oil, and it turned out that Iran is now taking over Iraq. Think of it. Iran is taking over Iraq, and they're taking it over big league.\n\nWe spent $2 trillion in Iraq, $2 trillion. We lost thousands of lives, thousands in Iraq. We have wounded soldiers, who I love, I love - they're great - all over the place, thousands and thousands of wounded soldiers.\n\nAnd we have nothing. We can't even go there. We have nothing. And every time we give Iraq equipment, the first time a bullet goes off in the air, they leave it.\n\nLast week, I read 2,300 Humvees- these are big vehicles- were left behind for the enemy. 2,000? You would say maybe two, maybe four? 2,300 sophisticated vehicles, they ran, and the enemy took them.\n\nLast quarter, it was just announced our gross domestic product- a sign of strength, right? But not for us. It was below zero. Whoever heard of this? It's never below zero.\n\nOur labor participation rate was the worst since 1978. But think of it, GDP below zero, horrible labor participation rate.\n\nAnd our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent. Don't believe the 5.6. Don't believe it.\n\nThat's right. A lot of people up there can't get jobs. They can't get jobs, because there are no jobs, because China has our jobs and Mexico has our jobs. They all have jobs.\n\nBut the real number, the real number is anywhere from 18 to 19 and maybe even 21 percent, and nobody talks about it, because it's a statistic that's full of nonsense.\n\nOur enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the way, and we as a country are getting weaker. Even our nuclear arsenal doesn't work.\n\nIt came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old. They don't know if it worked. And I thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television, because boy, does that send signals to Putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say, \"That is a group of people, and that is a nation that truly has no clue. They don't know what they're doing. They don't know what they're doing.\"\n\nWe have a disaster called the big lie: Obamacare. Obamacare.\n\nYesterday, it came out that costs are going for people up 29, 39, 49, and even 55 percent, and deductibles are through the roof. You have to be hit by a tractor, literally, a tractor, to use it, because the deductibles are so high, it's virtually useless. It's virtually useless. It is a disaster.\n\nAnd remember the $5 billion website? $5 billion we spent on a website, and to this day it doesn't work. A $5 billion website.\n\nI have so many websites, I have them all over the place. I hire people, they do a website. It costs me $3. $5 billion website.\n\nWell, you need somebody, because politicians are all talk, no action. Nothing's gonna get done. They will not bring us- believe me- to the promised land. They will not.\n\nAs an example, I've been on the circuit making speeches, and I hear my fellow Republicans. And they're wonderful people. I like them. They all want me to support them. They don't know how to bring it about. They come up to my office. I'm meeting with three of them in the next week. And they don't know- \"Are you running? Are you not running? Could we have your support? What do we do? How do we do it?\"\n\nI like them. And I hear their speeches. And they don't talk jobs and they don't talk China. When was the last time you heard China is killing us? They're devaluing their currency to a level that you wouldn't believe. It makes it impossible for our companies to compete, impossible. They're killing us.\n\nBut you don't hear that from anybody else. You don't hear it from anybody else. And I watch the speeches.\n\nI watch the speeches of these people, and they say the sun will rise, the moon will set, all sorts of wonderful things will happen. And people are saying, \"What's going on? I just want a job. Just get me a job. I don't need the rhetoric. I want a job.\"\n\nAnd that's what's happening. And it's going to get worse, because remember, Obamacare really kicks in in '16, 2016. Obama is going to be out playing golf. He might be on one of my courses. I would invite him, I actually would say. I have the best courses in the world, so I'd say, you what, if he wants to- I have one right next to the White House, right on the Potomac. If he'd like to play, that's fine.\n\nIn fact, I'd love him to leave early and play, that would be a very good thing.\n\nBut Obamacare kicks in in 2016. Really big league. It is going to be amazingly destructive. Doctors are quitting. I have a friend who's a doctor, and he said to me the other day, \"Donald, I never saw anything like it. I have more accountants than I have nurses. It's a disaster. My patients are beside themselves. They had a plan that was good. They have no plan now.\"\n\nWe have to repeal Obamacare, and it can be- and- and it can be replaced with something much better for everybody. Let it be for everybody. But much better and much less expensive for people and for the government. And we can do it.\n\nSo I've watched the politicians. I've dealt with them all my life. If you can't make a good deal with a politician, then there's something wrong with you. You're certainly not very good. And that's what we have representing us. They will never make America great again. They don't even have a chance. They're controlled fully- they're controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors, and by the special interests, fully.\n\nYes, they control them. Hey, I have lobbyists. I have to tell you. I have lobbyists that can produce anything for me. They're great. But you know what? it won't happen. It won't happen. Because we have to stop doing things for some people, but for this country, it's destroying our country. We have to stop, and it has to stop now.\n\nNow, our country needs- our country needs a truly great leader, and we need a truly great leader now. We need a leader that wrote \"The Art of the Deal.\"\n\nWe need a leader that can bring back our jobs, can bring back our manufacturing, can bring back our military, can take care of our vets. Our vets have been abandoned.\n\nAnd we also need a cheerleader.\n\nYou know, when President Obama was elected, I said, \"Well, the one thing, I think he'll do well. I think he'll be a great cheerleader for the country. I think he'd be a great spirit.\"\n\nHe was vibrant. He was young. I really thought that he would be a great cheerleader.\n\nHe's not a leader. That's true. You're right about that.\n\nBut he wasn't a cheerleader. He's actually a negative force. He's been a negative force. He wasn't a cheerleader; he was the opposite.\n\nWe need somebody that can take the brand of the United States and make it great again. It's not great again.\n\nWe need- we need somebody- we need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again. We can do that.\n\nAnd, I will tell you, I love my life. I have a wonderful family. They're saying, \"Dad, you're going to do something that's going to be so tough.\"\n\nYou know, all of my life, I've heard that a truly successful person, a really, really successful person and even modestly successful cannot run for public office. Just can't happen. And yet that's the kind of mindset that you need to make this country great again.\n\nSo ladies and gentlemen...I am officially running... for president of the United States, and we are going to make our country great again.\n\nIt can happen. Our country has tremendous potential. We have tremendous people.\n\nWe have people that aren't working. We have people that have no incentive to work. But they're going to have incentive to work, because the greatest social program is a job. And they'll be proud, and they'll love it, and they'll make much more than they would've ever made, and they'll be- they'll be doing so well, and we're going to be thriving as a country, thriving. It can happen.\n\nI will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created. I tell you that.\n\nI'll bring back our jobs from China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many places. I'll bring back our jobs, and I'll bring back our money.\n\nRight now, think of this: We owe China $1.3 trillion. We owe Japan more than that. So they come in, they take our jobs, they take our money, and then they loan us back the money, and we pay them in interest, and then the dollar goes up so their deal's even better.\n\nHow stupid are our leaders? How stupid are these politicians to allow this to happen? How stupid are they?\n\nI'm going to tell you- thank you. I'm going to tell you a couple of stories about trade, because I'm totally against the trade bill for a number of reasons.\n\nNumber one, the people negotiating don't have a clue. Our president doesn't have a clue. He's a bad negotiator.\n\nHe's the one that did Bergdahl. We get Bergdahl, they get five killer terrorists that everybody wanted over there.\n\nWe get Bergdahl. We get a traitor. We get a no-good traitor, and they get the five people that they wanted for years, and those people are now back on the battlefield trying to kill us. That's the negotiator we have.\n\nTake a look at the deal he's making with Iran. He makes that deal, Israel maybe won't exist very long. It's a disaster, and we have to protect Israel. But...\n\nSo we need people- I'm a free trader. But the problem with free trade is you need really talented people to negotiate for you. If you don't have talented people, if you don't have great leadership, if you don't have people that know business, not just a political hack that got the job because he made a contribution to a campaign, which is the way all jobs, just about, are gotten, free trade terrible.\n\nFree trade can be wonderful if you have smart people, but we have people that are stupid. We have people that aren't smart. And we have people that are controlled by special interests. And it's just not going to work.\n\nSo, here's a couple of stories happened recently. A friend of mine is a great manufacturer. And, you know, China comes over and they dump all their stuff, and I buy it. I buy it, because, frankly, I have an obligation to buy it, because they devalue their currency so brilliantly, they just did it recently, and nobody thought they could do it again.\n\nBut with all our problems with Russia, with all our problems with everything- everything, they got away with it again. And it's impossible for our people here to compete.\n\nSo I want to tell you this story. A friend of mine who's a great manufacturer, calls me up a few weeks ago. He's very upset. I said, \"What's your problem?\"\n\nHe said, \"You know, I make great product.\"\n\nAnd I said, \"I know. I know that because I buy the product.\"\n\nHe said, \"I can't get it into China. They won't accept it. I sent a boat over and they actually sent it back. They talked about environmental, they talked about all sorts of crap that had nothing to do with it.\"\n\nI said, \"Oh, wait a minute, that's terrible. Does anyone know this?\"\n\nHe said, \"Yeah, they do it all the time with other people.\"\n\nI said, \"They send it back?\"\n\n\"Yeah. So I finally got it over there and they charged me a big tariff. They're not supposed to be doing that. I told them.\"\n\nNow, they do charge you tariff on trucks, when we send trucks and other things over there.\n\nAsk Boeing. They wanted Boeing's secrets. They wanted their patents and all their secrets before they agreed to buy planes from Boeing.\n\nHey, I'm not saying they're stupid. I like China. I sell apartments for- I just sold an apartment for $15 million to somebody from China. Am I supposed to dislike them? I own a big chunk of the Bank of America Building at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, that I got from China in a war. Very valuable.\n\nI love China. The biggest bank in the world is from China. You know where their United States headquarters is located? In this building, in Trump Tower. I love China. People say, \"Oh, you don't like China?\"\n\nNo, I love them. But their leaders are much smarter than our leaders, and we can't sustain ourself with that. There's too much- it's like- it's like take the New England Patriots and Tom Brady and have them play your high school football team. That's the difference between China's leaders and our leaders.\n\nThey are ripping us. We are rebuilding China. We're rebuilding many countries. China, you go there now, roads, bridges, schools, you never saw anything like it. They have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge look like small potatoes. And they're all over the place.\n\nWe have all the cards, but we don't know how to use them. We don't even know that we have the cards, because our leaders don't understand the game. We could turn off that spigot by charging them tax until they behave properly.\n\nNow they're going militarily. They're building a military island in the middle of the South China sea. A military island. Now, our country could never do that because we'd have to get environmental clearance, and the environmentalist wouldn't let our country- we would never build in an ocean. They built it in about one year, this massive military port.\n\nThey're building up their military to a point that is very scary. You have a problem with ISIS. You have a bigger problem with China.\n\nAnd, in my opinion, the new China, believe it or not, in terms of trade, is Mexico.\n\nSo this man tells me about the manufacturing. I say, \"That's a terrible story. I hate to hear it.\"\n\nBut I have another one, Ford.\n\nSo Mexico takes a company, a car company that was going to build in Tennessee, rips it out. Everybody thought the deal was dead. Reported it in the Wall Street Journal recently. Everybody thought it was a done deal. It's going in and that's going to be it, going into Tennessee. Great state, great people.\n\nAll of a sudden, at the last moment, this big car manufacturer, foreign, announces they're not going to Tennessee. They're gonna spend their $1 billion in Mexico instead. Not good.\n\nNow, Ford announces a few weeks ago that Ford is going to build a $2.5 billion car and truck and parts manufacturing plant in Mexico. $2.5 billion, it's going to be one of the largest in the world. Ford. Good company.\n\nSo I announced that I'm running for president. I would...\n\n... one of the early things I would do, probably before I even got in- and I wouldn't even use- you know, I have- I know the smartest negotiators in the world. I know the good ones. I know the bad ones. I know the overrated ones.\n\nYou get a lot of them that are overrated. They're not good. They think they are. They get good stories, because the newspapers get buffaloed. But they're not good.\n\nBut I know the negotiators in the world, and I put them one for each country. Believe me, folks. We will do very, very well, very, very well.\n\nBut I wouldn't even waste my time with this one. I would call up the head of Ford, who I know. If I was president, I'd say, \"Congratulations. I understand that you're building a nice $2.5 billion car factory in Mexico and that you're going to take your cars and sell them to the United States zero tax, just flow them across the border.\"\n\nAnd you say to yourself, \"How does that help us,\" right? \"How does that help us? Where is that good\"? It's not.\n\nSo I would say, \"Congratulations. That's the good news. Let me give you the bad news. Every car and every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border, we're going to charge you a 35-percent tax, and that tax is going to be paid simultaneously with the transaction, and that's it.\n\nNow, here's what is going to happen. If it's not me in the position, it's one of these politicians that we're running against, you know, the 400 people that we're (inaudible). And here's what's going to happen. They're not so stupid. They know it's not a good thing, and they may even be upset by it. But then they're going to get a call from the donors or probably from the lobbyist for Ford and say, \"You can't do that to Ford, because Ford takes care of me and I take care of you, and you can't do that to Ford.\"\n\nAnd guess what? No problem. They're going to build in Mexico. They're going to take away thousands of jobs. It's very bad for us.\n\nSo under President Trump, here's what would happen:\n\nThe head of Ford will call me back, I would say within an hour after I told them the bad news. But it could be he'd want to be cool, and he'll wait until the next day. You know, they want to be a little cool.\n\nAnd he'll say, \"Please, please, please.\" He'll beg for a little while, and I'll say, \"No interest.\" Then he'll call all sorts of political people, and I'll say, \"Sorry, fellas. No interest,\" because I don't need anybody's money. It's nice. I don't need anybody's money.\n\nI'm using my own money. I'm not using the lobbyists. I'm not using donors. I don't care. I'm really rich. I (inaudible).\n\nAnd by the way, I'm not even saying that's the kind of mindset, that's the kind of thinking you need for this country.\n\nSo- because we got to make the country rich.\n\nIt sounds crass. Somebody said, \"Oh, that's crass.\" It's not crass.\n\nWe got $18 trillion in debt. We got nothing but problems.\n\nWe got a military that needs equipment all over the place. We got nuclear weapons that are obsolete.\n\nWe've got nothing. We've got Social Security that's going to be destroyed if somebody like me doesn't bring money into the country. All these other people want to cut the hell out of it. I'm not going to cut it at all; I'm going to bring money in, and we're going to save it.\n\nBut here's what's going to happen:\n\nAfter I'm called by 30 friends of mine who contributed to different campaigns, after I'm called by all of the special interests and by the- the donors and by the lobbyists- and they have zero chance at convincing me, zero- I'll get a call the next day from the head of Ford. He'll say. \"Please reconsider,\" I'll say no.\n\nHe'll say, \"Mr. President, we've decided to move the plant back to the United States, and we're not going to build it in Mexico.\" That's it. They have no choice. They have no choice.\n\nThere are hundreds of things like that. I'll give you another example.\n\nSaudi Arabia, they make $1 billion a day. $1 billion a day. I love the Saudis. Many are in this building. They make a billion dollars a day. Whenever they have problems, we send over the ships. We say \"we're gonna protect.\" What are we doing? They've got nothing but money.\n\nIf the right person asked them, they'd pay a fortune. They wouldn't be there except for us.\n\nAnd believe me, you look at the border with Yemen. You remember Obama a year ago, Yemen was a great victory. Two weeks later, the place was blown up. Everybody got out- and they kept our equipment.\n\nThey always keep our equipment. We ought to send used equipment, right? They always keep our equipment. We ought to send some real junk, because, frankly, it would be- we ought to send our surplus. We're always losing this gorgeous brand-new stuff.\n\nBut look at that border with Saudi Arabia. Do you really think that these people are interested in Yemen? Saudi Arabia without us is gone. They're gone.\n\nAnd I'm the one that made all of the right predictions about Iraq. You know, all of these politicians that I'm running against now- it's so nice to say I'm running as opposed to if I run, if I run. I'm running.\n\nBut all of these politicians that I'm running against now, they're trying to disassociate. I mean, you looked at Bush, it took him five days to answer the question on Iraq. He couldn't answer the question. He didn't know. I said, \"Is he intelligent?\"\n\nThen I looked at Rubio. He was unable to answer the question, is Iraq a good thing or bad thing? He didn't know. He couldn't answer the question.\n\nHow are these people gonna lead us? How are we gonna- how are we gonna go back and make it great again? We can't. They don't have a clue. They can't lead us. They can't. They can't even answer simple questions. It was terrible.\n\nBut Saudi Arabia is in big, big trouble. Now, thanks to fracking and other things, the oil is all over the place. And I used to say it, there are ships at sea, and this was during the worst crisis, that were loaded up with oil, and the cartel kept the price up, because, again, they were smarter than our leaders. They were smarter than our leaders.\n\nThere is so much wealth out there that can make our country so rich again, and therefore make it great again. Because we need money. We're dying. We're dying. We need money. We have to do it. And we need the right people.\n\nSo Ford will come back. They'll all come back. And I will say this, this is going to be an election, in my opinion, that's based on competence.\n\nSomebody said - thank you, darlin'.\n\nSomebody said to me the other day, a reporter, a very nice reporter, \"But, Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person.\"\n\nThat's true. But actually I am. I think I am a nice person. People that know me, like me. Does my family like me? I think so, right. Look at my family. I'm proud of my family.\n\nBy the way, speaking of my family, Melania, Barron, Kai, Donnie, Don, Vanessa, Tiffany, Evanka did a great job. Did she do a great job?\n\nGreat. Jared, Laura and Eric, I'm very proud of my family. They're a great family.\n\nSo the reporter said to me the other day, \"But, Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person. How can you get people to vote for you?\"\n\nI said, \"I don't know.\" I said, \"I think that number one, I am a nice person. I give a lot of money away to charities and other things. I think I'm actually a very nice person.\"\n\nBut, I said, \"This is going to be an election that's based on competence, because people are tired of these nice people. And they're tired of being ripped off by everybody in the world. And they're tired of spending more money on education than any nation in the world per capita, than any nation in the world, and we are 26th in the world, 25 countries are better than us in education. And some of them are like third world countries. But we're becoming a third word country, because of our infrastructure, our airports, our roads, everything. So one of the things I did, and I said, you know what I'll do. I'll do it. Because a lot of people said, \"He'll never run. Number one, he won't want to give up his lifestyle.\"\n\nThey're right about that, but I'm doing it.\n\nNumber two, I'm a private company, so nobody knows what I'm worth. And the one thing is that when you run, you have to announce and certify to all sorts of governmental authorities your net worth.\n\nSo I said, \"That's OK.\" I'm proud of my net worth. I've done an amazing job.\n\nI started off- thank you- I started off in a small office with my father in Brooklyn and Queens, and my father said - and I love my father. I learned so much. He was a great negotiator. I learned so much just sitting at his feet playing with blocks listening to him negotiate with subcontractors. But I learned a lot.\n\nBut he used to say, \"Donald, don't go into Manhattan. That's the big leagues. We don't know anything about that. Don't do it.\"\n\nI said, \"I gotta go into Manhattan. I gotta build those big buildings. I gotta do it, Dad. I've gotta do it.\"\n\nAnd after four or five years in Brooklyn, I ventured into Manhattan and did a lot of great deals- the Grand Hyatt Hotel. I was responsible for the convention center on the west side. I did a lot of great deals, and I did them early and young. And now I'm building all over the world, and I love what I'm doing.\n\nBut they all said, a lot of the pundits on television, \"Well, Donald will never run, and one of the main reasons is he's private and he's probably not as successful as everybody thinks.\"\n\nSo I said to myself, you know, nobody's ever going to know unless I run, because I'm really proud of my success. I really am.\n\nI've employed- I've employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime. That means medical. That means education. That means everything.\n\nSo a large accounting firm and my accountants have been working for months, because it's big and complex, and they've put together a statement, a financial statement, just a summary. But everything will be filed eventually with the government, and we don't [use] extensions or anything. We'll be filing it right on time. We don't need anything.\n\nAnd it was even reported incorrectly yesterday, because they said, \"He had assets of $9 billion.\" So I said, \"No, that's the wrong number. That's the wrong number. Not assets.\"\n\nSo they put together this. And before I say it, I have to say this. I made it the old-fashioned way. It's real estate. You know, it's real estate.\n\nIt's labor, and it's unions good and some bad and lots of people that aren't in unions, and it's all over the place and building all over the world.\n\nAnd I have assets- big accounting firm, one of the most highly respected- 9 billion 240 million dollars.\n\nAnd I have liabilities of about $500 million. That's long-term debt, very low interest rates.\n\nIn fact, one of the big banks came to me and said, \"Donald, you don't have enough borrowings. Could we loan you $4 billion\"? I said, \"I don't need it. I don't want it. And I've been there. I don't want it.\"\n\nBut in two seconds, they give me whatever I wanted. So I have a total net worth, and now with the increase, it'll be well-over $10 billion. But here, a total net worth of-net worth, not assets, not- a net worth, after all debt, after all expenses, the greatest assets- Trump Tower, 1290 Avenue of the Americas, Bank of America building in San Francisco, 40 Wall Street, sometimes referred to as the Trump building right opposite the New York- many other places all over the world.\n\nSo the total is $8,737,540,00.\n\nNow I'm not doing that...\n\nI'm not doing that to brag, because you know what? I don't have to brag. I don't have to, believe it or not.\n\nI'm doing that to say that that's the kind of thinking our country needs. We need that thinking. We have the opposite thinking.\n\nWe have losers. We have losers. We have people that don't have it. We have people that are morally corrupt. We have people that are selling this country down the drain.\n\nSo I put together this statement, and the only reason I'm telling you about it today is because we really do have to get going, because if we have another three or four years- you know, we're at $8 trillion now. We're soon going to be at $20 trillion.\n\nAccording to the economists- who I'm not big believers in, but, nevertheless, this is what they're saying- that $24 trillion- we're very close- that's the point of no return. $24 trillion. We will be there soon. That's when we become Greece. That's when we become a country that's unsalvageable. And we're gonna be there very soon. We're gonna be there very soon.\n\nSo, just to sum up, I would do various things very quickly. I would repeal and replace the big lie, Obamacare.\n\nI would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I'll build them very inexpensively, I will build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall.\n\nMark my words.\n\nNobody would be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump. Nobody.\n\nI will find - within our military, I will find the General Patton or I will find General MacArthur, I will find the right guy. I will find the guy that's going to take that military and make it really work. Nobody, nobody will be pushing us around.\n\nI will stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons. And we won't be using a man like Secretary Kerry that has absolutely no concept of negotiation, who's making a horrible and laughable deal, who's just being tapped along as they make weapons right now, and then goes into a bicycle race at 72 years old, and falls and breaks his leg. I won't be doing that. And I promise I will never be in a bicycle race. That I can tell you.\n\nI will immediately terminate President Obama's illegal executive order on immigration, immediately.\n\nFully support and back up the Second Amendment.\n\nNow, it's very interesting. Today I heard it. Through stupidity, in a very, very hard core prison, interestingly named Clinton, two vicious murderers, two vicious people escaped, and nobody knows where they are. And a woman was on television this morning, and she said, \"You know, Mr. Trump,\" and she was telling other people, and I actually called her, and she said, \"You know, Mr. Trump, I always was against guns. I didn't want guns. And now since this happened\"- it's up in the prison area- \"my husband and I are finally in agreement, because he wanted the guns. We now have a gun on every table. We're ready to start shooting.\"\n\nI said, \"Very interesting.\"\n\nSo protect the Second Amendment.\n\nEnd- end Common Core. Common Core should- it is a disaster. Bush is totally in favor of Common Core. I don't see how he can possibly get the nomination. He's weak on immigration. He's in favor of Common Core. How the hell can you vote for this guy? You just can't do it. We have to end education has to be local.\n\nRebuild the country's infrastructure.\n\nNobody can do that like me. Believe me. It will be done on time, on budget, way below cost, way below what anyone ever thought.\n\nI look at the roads being built all over the country, and I say I can build those things for one-third. What they do is unbelievable, how bad.\n\nYou know, we're building on Pennsylvania Avenue, the Old Post Office, we're converting it into one of the world's great hotels. It's gonna be the best hotel in Washington, D.C. We got it from the General Services Administration in Washington. The Obama administration. We got it. It was the most highly sought after- or one of them, but I think the most highly sought after project in the history of General Services. We got it. People were shocked, Trump got it.\n\nWell, I got it for two reasons. Number one, we're really good. Number two, we had a really good plan. And I'll add in the third, we had a great financial statement. Because the General Services, who are terrific people, by the way, and talented people, they wanted to do a great job. And they wanted to make sure it got built.\n\nSo we have to rebuild our infrastructure, our bridges, our roadways, our airports. You come into La Guardia Airport, it's like we're in a third world country. You look at the patches and the 40-year-old floor. They throw down asphalt, and they throw.\n\nYou look at these airports, we are like a third world country. And I come in from China and I come in from Qatar and I come in from different places, and they have the most incredible airports in the world. You come to back to this country and you have LAX, disaster. You have all of these disastrous airports. We have to rebuild our infrastructure.\n\nSave Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts. Have to do it.\n\nGet rid of the fraud. Get rid of the waste and abuse, but save it. People have been paying it for years. And now many of these candidates want to cut it. You save it by making the United States, by making us rich again, by taking back all of the money that's being lost.\n\nRenegotiate our foreign trade deals.\n\nReduce our $18 trillion in debt, because, believe me, we're in a bubble. We have artificially low interest rates. We have a stock market that, frankly, has been good to me, but I still hate to see what's happening. We have a stock market that is so bloated.\n\nBe careful of a bubble because what you've seen in the past might be small potatoes compared to what happens. So be very, very careful.\n\nAnd strengthen our military and take care of our vets. So, so important.\n\nSadly, the American dream is dead.\n\nBut if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and we will make America great again.\n\nThank you. Thank you very much.\n\nRead next: How Donald Trump Stole Jeb Bush's Moment\n\nListen to the most important stories of the day.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "Republicans Want to Party Like It's 1985\n\nD uring the Republican convention in Cleveland, when the phrase \"Make America Great Again\" was ubiquitous, TIME polled readers on what year they thought the nation peaked (as well as what party they typically support). The results were unambiguous: Democrats felt that the best days are ahead, while Republicans pined for a return the heart of the Reagan administration.\n\nMore than 10 percent of Democrats chose 2016-more than twice as many as chose 1999, the second most-popular choice. (While not technically the last year of the Clinton Administration, Democrats of a certain age will not remember the year 2000 with fondness.)\n\nRepublicans, by contrast, were most likely to chose 1985, closely followed by 1950 and 1984.\n\nOf course, everyone interprets the question differently. In Philadelphia, delegates had a range of responses. Rose Washington, a Florida delegate, chose 1965 because it was the year the Voting Rights Act passed. She took particular umbrage at the phrase at the core of the Trump campaign.\n\n\"It's code words ... for people who believed that it was great when African Americans were helping to build this country as slaves. So that's his code word to those people. 'Let's make it great again.'\"\n\nWisconsin delegate David Jordan, meanwhile, was torn between 2000 and 2008, bookending the George W. Bush administration. Jan Kallish of Illinois had a less common answer: 2001, \"when the country came together\" after the 9/11 attacks.\n\nWrite to Chris Wilson / Philadelphia at chris.wilson@time.com"

      "text": "Trump's Christian Nationalist Vision for America\n\nD onald Trump's ambivalence on abortion is back in the news because of his recent flip-flopping on a November referendum in his home state of Florida. On August 29, Trump said he suggested he would vote for the referendum , which would expand abortion rights and overturn the state's current six-week abortion ban. After intense blowback from anti-abortion activists, Trump walked back his support the next day.\n\nWhile Trump's about face on this referendum shows that the activist class still has some pull, it remains true that Trump has done something unimaginable in modern Republican politics. He has bullied the GOP into abandoning four decades of support for a national ban on abortion. Even more surprising, there's no evidence that Trump's renegotiation of the allegedly nonnegotiable has hurt him among the rank and file of the party.\n\nThis perplexing outcome is revelatory. Trump's cavalier treatment of this supposedly sacred issue has exposed the Republican Party's best kept secret: The connection between Republican voters and their leaders was never primarily about abortion. Rather, as Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" (MAGA) transformation of the party reveals, Trump's bond with his supporters is forged from different material: namely, his militant mission to return power to white Christian America.\n\nTrump instinctively understands this reality. In contrast to his vacillation on abortion, Trump's rallies are filled with evocations of an idealized ethno-religious state that are articulate, energetic, and consistent. His nostalgic diatribes about reclaiming a lost white Christian past fueled his rise to presidential power, and he has continued this strategy in 2024.\n\nOne of Trump's early re-election campaign stops was the annual meeting of the National Religious Broadcasters in Nashville on February 22, attended by leaders of the largest white evangelical communications outlets. In his rambling 75-minute speech to these Christian Right leaders, Trump spent a scant two minutes talking about abortion. He began strongly, stating, \"From my first day in office, I took historic action to protect the unborn. Like nobody has ever done.\" He also touted his attendance at the March pro-life rally in Washington, DC. But then he hailed his achievement of sending \"this issue\" (he notably did not utter the word \"abortion\" in the speech) back to the states since \"everybody agrees that's where it should be\"-a position that is a clear abandonment of a nationwide ban on abortion. While there was no applause for that line, the crowd remained with him.\n\nThe beating heart of the speech was the projection of a white Christian nationalist vision. Trump told the enthusiastic crowd-many of whom sported red hats emblazoned with the words \"Make America Pray Again\"-that he knew they were \"under siege.\" He declared that one of his first acts of his second term would be to set up a task force to root out \"anti-Christian bias\" and pledged to protect \"pro-God context and content.\" He received spontaneous applause for vows to promote school vouchers for private Christian schools and seal the United States' southern border against \"an illegal alien invasion by the world's most sadistic criminals and savage gangs.\"\n\nHe openly mentioned his four criminal indictments but transformed them into a messianic narrative. Echoing the evangelical theology of substitutionary atonement, he claimed , \"I've been very busy fighting and, you know, taking the, the bullets, taking the arrows. I'm taking 'em for you. And I'm so honored to take 'em. You have no idea. I'm being indicted for you.\"  After he narrowly survived an assassination attempt in August, Trump mused that he was only alive because of divine intervention, making this messianic comparison quite literal.\n\nNotably, his promises to the evangelical broadcasters extended beyond the realm of policy: \"If I get in, you're going to be using that power at a level that you've never used before.\" He continued: \"I really believe it's the biggest thing missing from this country, the biggest thing missing. We have to bring back our religion. We have to bring back Christianity in this country.\"\n\nTrump's deployment of the term \"our religion\"-one he regularly rolls out when addressing predominantly white evangelical audiences-is transparently an affirmation of an America of, by, and for white conservative Christians. This worldview, most frequently referred to as white Christian nationalism today, is an old one, predating the founding of our nation. It flows directly from the 500-year-old Christian Doctrine of Discovery-the idea that America was designated by God to be a promised land for European Christians-which justified the settler colonial project and lies at the ancient headwaters of our nation's history.\n\nA 2024 study conducted by PRRI , where I serve as president and founder, explored just how strongly white Christian nationalism is connected to Trump's contemporary allure. Building on research by political scientists Paul Djupe , Phil Gorski, Sam Perry , and Andrew Whitehead , PRRI developed five distinct agree/disagree questions to measure support for Christian nationalism:\n\nThe PRRI survey, the largest ever conducted on this topic, finds that 3 in 10 Americans can be classified as Christian nationalism Adherents or Sympathizers (those who either fully or mostly agree with these five statements), while two thirds of Americans can be classified as Skeptics or Rejecters (those who either mostly or fully disagree with these five sentiments). So, by a margin of two to one, most Americans oppose this anti-democratic worldview.\n\nBut the minority of Americans who affirm these sentiments wield disproportionate power because their voices are amplified through Donald Trump's MAGA movement and its takeover of the Republican Party. Today, a majority of Republicans (55%)-and fully two thirds (66%) of white evangelicals, the religious base of the GOP-qualify as Christian nationalist Adherents or Sympathizers.\n\nThe survey also reveals how tightly Christian nationalism is correlated with support for Donald Trump, not just at the national level but at the state level. The proportion of Americans who qualify as Christian nationalism Adherents or Sympathizers differs considerably across states, but there is a distinct pattern. Residents of red states are nearly twice as likely as residents of blue states to be Christian nationalism Adherents or Sympathizers. And among white Americans, the positive correlation between a state's average score on the Christian nationalism scale and the proportion of residents who cast votes for Trump in 2020 is a textbook example of a strong linear relationship. The more strongly white residents of a state support Christian nationalism, the more likely they were to have cast their votes for Trump in 2020.\n\nWhy should we be worried about this? There is, of course, the obvious answer that the overall vision of America as a promised land for European Christians is fundamentally anti-democratic. Beyond that, Christian nationalist beliefs are strongly linked to a range of other attitudes that are corrosive to democracy : white racial resentment and denials of the existence of systemic racism, antisemitism, Islamophobia, anti-immigrant sentiment, homophobia, and support for patriarchal gender roles.  In other words, white Christian nationalism evokes a set of hierarchies that positions white, Christian, heterosexual men as the divinely ordained ruling class. This assertion of white Christian entitlement and chosen-ness is toxic to the values of pluralism and equality on which democracy depends.\n\nMost ominously, Christian nationalists are more likely than other Americans to think about politics in apocalyptic terms and are about twice as likely as other Americans to believe political violence may be justified in our current circumstances. Nearly 4 in 10 Christian nationalism Adherents (38%) and one-third of Sympathizers (33%) agree that \"Because things have gotten so far off track, true American patriots may have to resort to violence to save the country,\" compared with only 17% of Christian nationalism Skeptics and 7% of Rejecters. And support for political violence among Christian nationalists is hardening. While there is no significant shift in support for political violence among Christian nationalism Adherents across the last year, among Sympathizers support for political violence is up 11 percentage points.\n\nThe worldview of white Christian nationalism raises the stakes of political contests exponentially, transposing political opponents into existential enemies. Politics are no longer understood to be honest disagreements between fellow citizens but rather apocalyptic battles over good and evil, literally fought by agents of God against agents of Satan. From these illiberal assumptions, it easily follows that political rivals should not just be defeated in fair electoral contests; they should be jailed, exiled, or even killed.\n\nThis racist ideology thankfully no longer rests comfortably in the psyches of most Americans. But it has, paradoxically, found a final refuge in the shambles of the party of Lincoln. More than any other discreet moment in the last half century, the 2024 election will present us with a choice that is much more than partisan.\n\nWe will have an opportunity to choose between a regressive fantasy of America as a white Christian nation and an aspirational vision of America as a pluralistic democracy. Until we find the will to finally reject the dangerous, authoritarian political theology that now controls one of our two political parties, it will continue to undermine the potential for a truly democratic American future.\n\nExcerpt adapted from the paperback edition of The Hidden Roots of White Supremacy and a Path to a Shared American Future by Robert P.

      "text": "As Republicans Wrap Up Their Convention, One Thing Defines the Party More Than Any Ideology or Policy: Donald Trump\n\nThis article is part of the The DC Brief, TIME's politics newsletter. Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox every weekday.\n\nIf you were tuning into American politics for the first time to watch this week's GOP convention, you'd be excused for your confusion over how the Republican Party proposes to run the country. There is no official platform . The planks seem constructed out of personality and feelings, not policy or details. During his three-plus years in office, its leader, President Donald Trump, has erased any lingering doubts that the Republican Party is functioning as more than an appendage of the Trump identity, and that it might be beholden to his brand of gut-driven politics for years.\n\nIn accepting this reality, Republicans may have made a deal that could give them another four years in the White House, but will set them back decades. After all, Trump won't be around forever to marshal his supporters' votes with the flair of a reality show star, and a second-term Trump will have nothing to lose in thrashing norms and institutions the GOP has backed for generations. The party that lionized Ronald Reagan's demand that Moscow \"tear down this wall\" in Berlin is now silent when Vladimir Putin's chief rival is poisoned.\n\nTrump takes the stage tonight to close out what has been a week of pandemic-changed staging. But few of the talking points were altered to meet the moment. Shows of empathy for a country that surpassed 180,000 COVID-19 deaths mid-convention were so rare they were newsworthy. Instead, the speakers painted a picture of a Republican Party that is hostile to minorities moving into the suburbs, proudly embraces isolationism and nationalism, and nostalgic for days of yesteryear.\n\n\"This is not just a choice between Republican and Democrat, or Left and Right,\" Trump's daughter-in-law and campaign adviser Lara Trump said Wednesday. \"This is an election that will decide if we keep America America, or if we head down an uncharted, frightening path towards socialism.\"\n\nOr as Vice President Mike Pence put it, in a nod to Trump's successful 2016 slogan: \"We will make America great again - again.\"\n\nPolitical conventions are never about the minutiae of governance. But they do offer the party leadership an idea of where its membership is going - especially among the activists and insiders who labor for years to earn an invite to the less-than-glamorous meetings away from balloon drops and receptions. They form the spine of a party's identity and ideals, if little backbone in practicality. Then they telegraph to the rest of the country what it means to be a member of this tribe. Rather than hash out any of that this year, Trump's convention adopted a one-page resolution saying the GOP \"has and will continue to enthusiastically support the President's America-first agenda.\"\n\nTrying to decode what else Republicans stand for right now yields all sorts of contradictions. First daughter Tiffany Trump apparently forgot that her father literally banned people from countries with Muslim majorities from coming to the U.S. when she uttered this declaration during her Tuesday speech: \"To all houses of worship and to all people of faith, stripped of our religious freedoms and religious liberties, my father will fight for you.\" She also said her father had reduced drug prices through an executive order , whose text was supposed to have gone into effect this week but doesn't appear to have ever been released .\n\nSimilarly, former acting spy chief Richard Grenell declared on Wednesday that for \"those who seek freedom\" and \"take tremendous personal risks,\" the Trump Administration will support them. Grenell cited Hong Kong, Tehran and Minsk, but left out Russia, where Putin's rival was poisoned, and Mexico, where asylum seekers are still trying to find freedom in the United States. Grenell, also a former Ambassador to Germany, defended nationalism in his remarks, and said it's no insult when people call Trump a nationalist.\n\nDespite this week marking the two-year anniversary of Sen. John McCain's death , it drew no mention among the Republicans' official program. The lifelong Republican and 2008 GOP nominee had more time in memorial at the Democrats' convention last week. Sen. Martha McSally, who was appointed to fill the balance of McCain's term and is running for her first full term this fall, didn't utter his name once in her remarks on Wednesday. In turn, The next morning, more than 100 alumni of McCain's 2008 campaign announced their support for Biden. They join scores of former aides to George W. Bush and Mitt Romney in doing so.\n\nTo be sure, there was plenty of traditional Republican imagery and ideology on display: gauzy shots of rural America and promises of \"freedom, prosperity and economic growth,\" as Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa said while in a plaid shirt while standing in what appeared to be a barn.\n\nBut it's Trumpism that will define Republicans' core ideology on this final day of the convention. So far, only one speaker has articulated the strange place where the party has found itself. In a June primary, Madison Cawthorn elbowed his way past a Trump-selected primary candidate in North Carolina, and made his way onto the stage Wednesday night. If elected, as is expected in the deep Red district, the 25-year-old would be the youngest member of Congress elected in more than 200 years.\n\nAnd he seems to grasp the challenge ahead in his political career in the Republican Party. \"We are committed to building a new town square. It welcomes all ideas and people. Here, we will have freedom of speech, not freedom from speech,\" he said on Wednesday. \"To liberals, let's have a conversation. Be a true liberal, listen to other ideas and let the best ones prevail. To conservatives, let's define what we support and win the argument in areas like health care and the environment.\"\n\nLet's see what that plays out inside the circus tent of Trump's Republican Party once its tentpole leader is gone.\n\nMake sense of what matters in Washington.

      "text": "We finally know what Trump's 'Make America Great Again' slogan really means | Opinion\n\nI have had many Republican friends and colleagues over the years. However, since 2024 I have asked some of them a key question. \"When was America Great?\" I wanted to understand when, and where, President Donald Trump wanted to take the country. None of them seemed to know.\n\nAt first I thought it was in the 1950s, after World War II, when many white women were content with taking care of the home instead of making a career in the workplace. Maybe it was the early 1900s when women didn't have the right to vote. Whatever the year; Trump wanted African-Americans back in subservient positions and my Latino brothers back in the fields or on the other side of the border. Other immigrants, except Europeans, weren't welcomed.\n\nI also remember when President Barack Obama got under his skin and when he was upset that Obama's Affordable Healthcare Act was so popular. I remember how he kept pushing to \"Repeal and Replace,\" even though he never had anything to replace it with. Trump resented Obama and later President Joe Biden's successful strategy to bring the nation's unemployment rate down to 4%. Trump always bragged that he had the lowest unemployment rate in history, but he only moved it 1%. What a liar. The tragedy is that most Republicans believed the lies. The majority still do.\n\nThe truth is, the only significant policy out of Trump's first presidency was the tax cut for corporations and the rich. I guess one could include his mismanagement of COVID-19. Remember, he wanted us to drink bleach. Then when the vaccine came out, the Republicans said not to take it. The result was that 111 million Americans caught it, and 1.29 million died. Plus, the unemployment rate went back up to 11%. No problem. President Joe Biden brought it back down.\n\nBut, the point of this column is to say that after one and a half months on the job, it is clear when \"America was Great\" - 1877. That was the year the Republican Party convinced the \"Dixiecrats\" to pull the Union Army out of the South. That was the year that Jim Crow, Black Codes, KKK and \"legal discrimination\" began in earnest. President Abraham Lincoln had moved America from the fear of slavery in 1863, but in 1877 the Republicans decided to bring back fear, hatred and slavery of the mind by working out a deal to win the presidency of the United States.\n\nSomething similar is happening today. Fear and hatred of others is enslaving America before our very eyes, and most Americans are blind and silent. 1877 was the end of \"Reconstruction.\" Today, 2025, may be called the \"Deconstruction\" of America and democracy. Our allies are looking at us with disbelief and disappointment as Trump and the GOP lead us down the rabbit hole. Trump thinks it's \"beautiful.\" America is again believing the lies of the Republican Party. And Trump and the GOP are very good at manipulating the American media.\n\nHere we are again. But this time it is hurting all Americans, except very wealthy white men. Trump's administration is ruled by billionaires, and the MAGA folk who voted for him cannot see that they've been tricked. This isn't about Mexicans at the border; this is about controlling you, your livelihood and your hard earned money.\n\nRepublicans need to get \"WOKE,\" so they can see the truth and start thinking on their own. The really tragic part is, there is no one to come and rescue Americans from America. It has to be internal. It has to be us.\n\nWilliam \"Bill\" Nix, a former Vice President of Marketing and Government Affairs for the Cultural Council for Palm Beach County , lives in Delray Beach ."

      "text": "Trump's biggest gamble: Tariffs test his presidency, and everyone else\n\nDonald Trump has always been comfortable taking risks, from his early real estate deals to his late-in-life jump into electoral politics.\n\nNow by imposing tariffs that have started a global trade war, he is taking the biggest gamble of his lifetime.\n\nAnd maybe of everybody else's.\n\nTrump is betting that mainstream economists and presidents since World War II have been wrong in generally embracing trade as the best way to build prosperity at home and forge peaceful relations around the world. Instead, he argues that slapping on the steepest tariffs since the 1930s will bring a windfall in federal revenue and force an historic resurgence of manufacturing in the United States.\n\nU.S. customs agents began collecting 10% baseline tariffs on Saturday, with stiffer rounds to begin this week.\n\n\"THIS IS AN ECONOMIC REVOLUTION, AND WE WILL WIN,\" Trump posted on the social-media site Truth Social. \"HANG TOUGH, it won't be easy, but the end result will be historic. We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\"\n\nThat confidence isn't shared by everyone.\n\nInvestors, for instance. After Trump's announcement, the S&P 500 plunged 10.5%, and the Dow dropped by nearly 4,000 points, the markets' worst week since early in the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. In two days, the markets lost more than $6 trillion in value, a decline that millions of American could track in real time in their retirement accounts.\n\n\"This is the biggest self-inflicted wound we've put on our economy in history,\" former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said Sunday on ABC's \"This Week.\" \"There's no one, virtually, who doesn't work for the president who thinks this is a good idea.\"\n\nFor the first time in the modern era, a president's policy decision - not the emergence of a deadly virus or a terrorist attack like 9/11 - has shaken the global order, the repercussions not yet clear.\n\nThe contrasts between President Trump 1.0 and President Trump 2.0 are considerable.\n\nThe stiff taxes on U.S. imports are only the latest in a series of decisions he has made since his second inauguration that demonstrate his determination to command far-reaching changes on everything from the size and role of the federal government to the traditional guardrails of the justice system.\n\nOn Saturday, tens of thousands gathered on the National Mall in Washington to protest his early weeks in office, the largest of more than 1,000 \"Hands Off\" marches planned in all 50 states. Signs and chants targeted cuts in education and health care as well as the firing of federal workers and what demonstrators called assaults on democracy.\n\nThe president wasn't around to see them. He was in Florida, competing in the Senior Club Championship being held at the Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter.\n\nTrump no longer feels compelled to pay much attention to the Washington establishment voices that constrained some of his instincts during his first term. This time around, only tried-and-true loyalists have been appointed to the senior White House staff and the Cabinet.\n\n\"Donald Trump has been talking about this his whole life,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on CBS' \"Face the Nation,\" referring to his long-standing faith in tariffs. \"It is Donald Trump's agenda, and we're all here to help him execute it.\"\n\nThe president can cite reasons to justify his self-confidence. He has survived two impeachment trials and two assassination attempts, including one that came so close it grazed his ear, a rescue he has credited to God. Courtesy of his appointments to the Justice Department, the federal indictments he had once faced on charges of mishandling sensitive documents and subverting a free and fair election have been dismissed.\n\nEven so, Trump might have caught the classic disease of second-term presidents: overreach.\n\nOnly 18 people in history have been elected twice to the White House, so it's hardly a surprise that they tend to think highly of their political acumen and public standing. These days, they no longer have to worry about the next time they'll face voters; the Constitution's 22nd Amendment bars winning a third term.\n\nAfter his reelection in 2004, George W. Bush went on a doomed quest to partially privatize the Social Security system. The controversy that followed, along with the Iraq War, were forces behind a tsunami in the 2006 midterm elections that swept Democrats into control of the House and Senate. A \"thumpin',\" Bush called it.\n\nIn 2008, the GOP lost the White House, too.\n\nDecades earlier, Franklin Roosevelt was frustrated in his first term by Supreme Court rulings against his New Deal legislation. After he won a second term in a landslide, in 1936, he proposed expanding the high court with up to six more appointments, presumably friendlier ones.\n\nThe idea was greeted with bipartisan derision, including by his vice president, John Nance Garner. In the next midterm, Democrats lost 72 House seats and eight Senate seats.\n\nFor both presidents, their second-term misadventures cost them some of the political currency they had gained in their reelection, no longer available to spend on something else.\n\nEven a handful of congressional Republicans, who have been a compliant bunch since Trump was sworn in, are raising concerns.\n\nWith the support of four Republicans, the Senate passed a resolution last week to lift Trump's tariffs on Canada - a symbolic measure, given that the House is unlikely to pass it nor Trump to sign it, but a small alarm bell ringing for the White House anyway.\n\nSeven Republican senators are now co-sponsoring a bipartisan bill that would limit a president's power to impose tariffs and give Congress the power to end them.\n\nVoters are increasingly uneasy, too. A Wall Street Journal poll published Friday found Americans by 54%-42% opposed Trump's tariffs. Three-quarters of those surveyed predicted they would raise the cost of things they buy, which is also the view of most economists.\n\nJerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, warned Friday that Trump's tariffs risks fueling inflation and slowing growth. Trump's first-term vice president, Mike Pence , called them the \"largest peacetime tax hike in U.S. history.\" Economic forecasters have raised the odds of a recession .\n\nOn Sunday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested that the tariffs give Trump leverage in negotiations to reduce trade barriers including, presumably, the tariffs he has just imposed.\n\n\"He has created maximum leverage for himself, and more than 50 countries have approached the administration about lowering their non-tariff trade barriers, lowering their tariffs, stopping currency manipulation,\" Bessent said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" But he also said the administration was going to \"hold the course\" on the tariff regime. \"Because, you know, after 20, 30, 40, 50 years of bad behavior, you can't just wipe the slate clean.\"\n\nNegotiations could give Trump an exit ramp, if he wanted to take it.\n\nUnlike a Social Security proposal that failed or a court-packing scheme that was ridiculed, however, the imposition of tariffs have already had consequences that will be hard to unwind - not that there are any signs so far from Trump that he wants to unwind them. Tariffs reflect not only his view of the economy but of the U.S. role in the world, of America First.\n\nChina has responded with a 34% tariff of its own on U.S. goods, and the European Union vows retribution as well. The sense of the United States as a reliable partner, through thick and thin, has been shaken. Canada's \"old relationship\" with the United States is now \"over,\" Prime Minister Mark Carney declared in a national television address.\n\nWhat comes next?"

      "text": "Yes, please, make America great\n\nApparently, it is again time to make America great again. I'm not confident that will occur. Like many, I regard the election of Trump as an embarrassment that will probably become a disgrace.\n\nBut if Facebook comment threads have shown me anything about MAGA types, it is that they really want to prove me wrong. I hope they do that here. Still, greatness is a worthy goal, so I endorse this project, provided we can come to agreement on terms.\n\nI am a Democrat. An excellent entry point to our understanding of national greatness is in LBJ's inaugural, worth quoting at length: \"[America's] enemies have always made the same mistake. In my lifetime - in depression and in war - they have awaited our defeat. Each time, from the secret places of the American heart, came forth the faith they could not see or that they could not even imagine. It brought us victory. And it will again. For this is what America is all about. It is the uncrossed desert and the unclimbed ridge. It is the star that is not reached and the harvest sleeping in the unplowed ground. Is our world gone? We say 'Farewell.' Is a new world coming? We welcome it - and we will bend it to the hopes of man.\"\n\nIndeed. Democrats want to push toward new frontiers to build a great society. Many of us see America's strength as our faith that through effort we can build the society we deserve. In this worldview we cannot merely revive the past; progress will come through work to realize past ideals.\n\nMAGA is a contrasting philosophy. While it is never stated when exactly we need to return to, they seem to be saying if only we could return to the way things were, many current problems would solve themselves. It reminds me of Karl Popper's characterization of Plato in \"The Open Society\": \"The state which is free from the evil of change and corruption is the best, the perfect state. It is the state of the Golden Age which knew no change.\"\n\nThat kind of greatness is unearned, inherent. Our problems come because we are not following the rules - their rules - and not because they are difficult issues yet to be solved.\n\nThe Founders would surely have looked to Rome for their standard. Comparisons to that civilization are almost our birthright. Volume I of Gibbon's \"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\" was published in 1776. Jefferson and Adams owned a copy, and the other Founders were surely conversant in Gibbon's writings. Some have said America is experiencing a decline comparable to Rome's. I am one of many modern Roman hobbyists, collecting its coins and naming my daughter after Emperor Aurelian, but I can't agree: America hasn't existed long enough to merit the comparison.\n\nWe are nearing our 250 th anniversary. Rome lasted 1,229 years or a staggering 2,206 if you count the Eastern Romans. America can't hold a candle to that scale, and we need a better understanding of how long the American project should aim to be before trying to claim status as the G.O.A.T. nation.\n\nI suggest this rule of thumb: Think of Uncle Sam as a person who will live to be 100 years old, with each century being 10 years of this hypothetical life. We had our childhood in the 1700s. Some tempestuous teen years while we figured ourselves out in the 1800s. Our 20s were stellar, the equivalent of winning a Heisman, then a Rhodes, and graduating to precocious business success. We're now only in our early 30s. Uncle Sam, like most people, will likely peak from his 40s to 60s, over the next few hundred years.\n\nIn that time, I propose three accomplishments to prove us worthy of our pretensions: 1. Curing cancer entirely or to a great extent, a project President Biden began almost a decade ago as the Cancer Moonshot Initiative. 2. Master fusion energy. Clean, effectively limitless energy will mean the limits of our industrial efforts will only be our imagination. 3. Found interplanetary civilization. Human nature still yearns to expand to new territory. Our Apollo program began leading the way. We should continue to boldly go where no one has gone before.\n\nIt is encouraging that Trump has been listening to Elon Musk, who shares my mindset on what is worth striving toward. I suspect many others who want to \"Make America Great Again\" do too. Many in both parties understand that Uncle Sam is a young man whose destiny is still ours to determine. To those kindred spirits I say, let us start now, not because we are short of time but because the tasks are so big. With this mindset we can make America great in the Trump administration and beyond.\n\n- Brent Caldwell is from St. Martin (MS).

      "text": "As Trump's policy proposals shift, Harris' begin to emerge in 2024 presidential election\n\nFormer President Donald Trump touted a list of 20 campaign promises Tuesday, in a Truth Social post and a takeover of his website landing page.\n\nWhile Vice President Kamala Harris did not start revealing her agenda details until Friday , Trump has been associated with several platforms this election cycle alone.\n\nIn 2022, he started releasing videos and statements titled Agenda47 . As Democrats started drumming up fear around Project 2025 , the Republican National Committee released its official platform , which Trump put forward along with \" 20 Core Promises to Make America Great Again. \" That doesn't include the campaign trail tangents, like teasing a 20% universal tariff , which he mentioned in North Carolina this week.\n\nPolicy platform and messaging changes are common throughout a presidential election, says Northeastern University political science professor Costas Panagopoulos. He explained that the platforms today tend to be a blueprint for the kinds of things the party may want to do, but should be taken with a grain of salt.\n\n\"I think the scaled back nature of the Republican platform reflects in part, the fact that Donald Trump himself seems to think that these documents are essentially toothless and that voters may not be so interested in the intricacies of policy substance, so the message has been distilled and simplified in many ways,\" he said.\n\nHere is what to know about the evolution of Trump's platforms:\n\nTrump began releasing videos and statements detailing his policy plans in 2022 , throughout a primary season where he faced quickly-defeated challengers including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.\n\nThe plans include many proposals through the form of executive action to tackle crime, education, healthcare immigration, the economy, and more.\n\nSome of those ideas were attention-grabbers, like issuing the death sentence to drug dealers or creating a credentialing body to certify teachers in patriotism . Yet several issue areas such as healthcare were still not comprehensive.\n\nAgenda47 landing pages on Trump's campaign websites were later replaced with the RNC platform, but still remain online.\n\nProject 2025, also known as 2025 Presidential Transition Project , was published by the conservative think tank Heritage Foundation in April 2023.\n\nAs Democrats raised alarm bells about some extreme policy proposals included in the document, Trump attempted to distance himself from it , but many who were involved in the playbook's creations have ties to Trump and his first administration.\n\nWhile the 900-page proposal goes into much more detail than the other platforms, it includes some similar themes, including border security, curbing transgender rights, and energy dominance.\n\nAhead of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in July, the committee endorsed a platform that mirrored Trump's popular campaign points from the top down with a \"Make America Great Again\" slogan-turned title.\n\nThe preamble leaned heavily into the \"America First\" policies, arguing to secure the southern border, bring manufacturing back to the U.S., boost domestic energy production, and have a strong military.\n\nAbortion was notably largely left off the document , suggesting policy decisions should be left with the states as Trump avoided calling for a national abortion ban earlier this year.\n\nTrump's 20 Core Promises are included in the bigger RNC 'Make America Great Again' platform. The GOP introduces the platform as \"a forward-looking Agenda that begins with the following twenty promises that we will accomplish very quickly when we win the White House and Republican Majorities in the House and Senate.\"\n\nTrump touted this list after an interview with Elon Musk on Monday.\n\nTrump has used many of his political speeches criticizing the Biden administration and waging personal attacks on Harris, even as some GOP leaders try to focus on her policies .\n\nHarris started detailing her policy agenda starting with an economic plan ahead of a rally in North Carolina Friday. She proposed a federal ban on price gouging on food and groceries, up to $25,000 in assistance for first-time home buyers, and providing a tax incentive to builders to construct more starter homes.\n\nPanagopoulos said the rest of the Democratic platform is not out yet as they are typically adopted at the convention (though the Republicans endorsed their platforms ahead of their convention).\n\nThe Democratic National Convention is scheduled to take place in Chicago from Monday Aug. 19 until Thursday Aug. 22."

      "text": "We finally know what Trump's 'Make America Great Again' slogan really means | Opinion\n\nManage your account\n\nI have had many Republican friends and colleagues over the years. However, since 2024 I have asked some of them a key question. \"When was America Great?\" I wanted to understand when, and where, President Donald Trump wanted to take the country. None of them seemed to know.\n\nAt first I thought it was in the 1950s, after World War II, when many white women were content with taking care of the home instead of making a career in the workplace. Maybe it was the early 1900s when women didn't have the right to vote. Whatever the year; Trump wanted African-Americans back in subservient positions and my Latino brothers back in the fields or on the other side of the border. Other immigrants, except Europeans, weren't welcomed.\n\nI also remember when President Barack Obama got under his skin and when he was upset that Obama's Affordable Healthcare Act was so popular. I remember how he kept pushing to \"Repeal and Replace,\" even though he never had anything to replace it with. Trump resented Obama and later President Joe Biden's successful strategy to bring the nation's unemployment rate down to 4%. Trump always bragged that he had the lowest unemployment rate in history, but he only moved it 1%. What a liar. The tragedy is that most Republicans believed the lies. The majority still do.\n\nThe truth is, the only significant policy out of Trump's first presidency was the tax cut for corporations and the rich. I guess one could include his mismanagement of COVID-19. Remember, he wanted us to drink bleach. Then when the vaccine came out, the Republicans said not to take it. The result was that 111 million Americans caught it, and 1.29 million died. Plus, the unemployment rate went back up to 11%. No problem. President Joe Biden brought it back down.\n\nLetter: Trump could achieve his DOGE dreams by taxing the rich and taking less golf trips\n\nBut, the point of this column is to say that after one and a half months on the job, it is clear when \"America was Great\" - 1877. That was the year the Republican Party convinced the \"Dixiecrats\" to pull the Union Army out of the South. That was the year that Jim Crow, Black Codes, KKK and \"legal discrimination\" began in earnest. President Abraham Lincoln had moved America from the fear of slavery in 1863, but in 1877 the Republicans decided to bring back fear, hatred and slavery of the mind by working out a deal to win the presidency of the United States.\n\nSomething similar is happening today. Fear and hatred of others is enslaving America before our very eyes, and most Americans are blind and silent. 1877 was the end of \"Reconstruction.\" Today, 2025, may be called the \"Deconstruction\" of America and democracy. Our allies are looking at us with disbelief and disappointment as Trump and the GOP lead us down the rabbit hole. Trump thinks it's \"beautiful.\" America is again believing the lies of the Republican Party. And Trump and the GOP are very good at manipulating the American media.\n\nOpinion: Trump goes against every principle my father taught me. Where are our values?\n\nHere we are again. But this time it is hurting all Americans, except very wealthy white men. Trump's administration is ruled by billionaires, and the MAGA folk who voted for him cannot see that they've been tricked. This isn't about Mexicans at the border; this is about controlling you, your livelihood and your hard earned money.\n\nRepublicans need to get \"WOKE,\" so they can see the truth and start thinking on their own. The really tragic part is, there is no one to come and rescue Americans from America. It has to be internal. It has to be us.\n\nWilliam \"Bill\" Nix, a former Vice President of Marketing and Government Affairs for the Cultural Council for Palm Beach County , lives in Delray Beach .\n\nThis article originally appeared on Palm Beach Post: Trump wants to take us backwards.

Already, more than FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT, and rising fast! THIS IS AN ECONOMIC REVOLUTION, AND WE WILL WIN,\" Trump wrote .\n\nHere's What Trump Is Really Up To With High-stakes Tariff Gambit\n\nThis week's steep losses for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq were among the worst in the past decade as stocks tumbled for a second day in a row. On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 2,231.07 points, or 5.5%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell 5.97% and 5.82%, respectively. The Nasdaq entered into bear market territory on Friday.\n\nTrump implemented a 10% baseline tariff on all imported goods into the United States while some countries were slapped with higher tariffs.\n\nRead On The Fox News App\n\nBut Trump remains defiant that his plan will work in the long term as he aims to reduce America's trade deficit with other countries, protect American industries and bolster jobs by encouraging companies to move manufacturing back to the U.S.\n\n\"HANG TOUGH, it won't be easy, but the end result will be historic,\" Trump wrote. \"We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\" Trump wrote.\n\nTrump took aim at China after the communist country clapped back to Trump's Liberation Day tariff announcement with a reciprocal 34% tariff on U.S. imports.\n\n\"China has been hit much harder than the USA, not even close,\" Trump wrote. \"They, and many other nations, have treated us unsustainably badly. We have been the dumb and helpless \"whipping post,\" but not any longer.\"\n\nTrump's 34% tariffs announced against China on Wednesday come in addition to the 20% tariffs already imposed against the country.\n\nHow We Got To Liberation Day: A Look At Trump's Past Comments On Tariffs\n\n\"China played it wrong, they panicked - the one thing they cannot afford to do,\" Trump wrote Friday on Truth Social.\n\nThe back and forth has raised concerns about a global trade war and possible recession.\n\nThe new Chinese tariffs against the U.S. will go into effect on April 10, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nCompanies who sell their goods to China were hit hard on Friday, including those in aerospace, agriculture and heavy equipment.\n\nSome of Thursday's biggest losers - banks, airlines and technology companies - sank again on Friday. Others, such as retailers, clothing and restaurants, were down but not nearly as bad. A handful, like Nike, even posted small gains on Friday.\n\nThe so-called Magnificent 7 stocks that have dominated the market the past few years had some of the heaviest losses. Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Tesla have lost around $1.8 trillion in market value combined in the past two days.\n\nMeanwhile, a conservative legal group is challenging President Trump's tariffs on China, calling them \"an unlawful attempt\" to make Americans pay higher taxes on Chinese imports.\n\nThe Fox Business team and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article source: Trump urges Americans to 'hang tough' on tariffs plan as markets tumble"

      "text": "Opinion: Donald Trump Is Stuck in the 1980s. Here's Why That Matters\n\nManage your account\n\nIn announcing his broad-scale tariffs on Wednesday at the White House, President Donald Trump said this of Lee Iacocca , a businessman he had in the distant past dealt with: \"He's an older guy, real pro, really top guy.\"\n\nIacocca was a legendary automobile executive. He was at the peak of his powers in the 1980s. He died in 2019.\n\nHow many Americans under the age of, say, 55 even know Iacocca's name-much less what he did? 15%? That may be generous.\n\nThe point here is not to run down Iacocca. He was legitimately famous for decades! Instead, it's to note that Trump really is stuck in the '80s. With everything from his cultural references to his views of how the American economy works best, he is firmly rooted about four decades ago.\n\nConsider this exchange between Trump and Chuck Todd on Meet the Press back in 2015:\n\nChuck Todd : All right. Your slogan, we're going to hear it a lot today at the fair. \"We're going to make America great again.\" When was the -\n\nDonald Trump : Great slogan.\n\nTodd : When was the last time America was great?\n\nTrump : I would say during the administration of Ronald Reagan you felt proud to be an American. You felt really proud. I don't think since then to any great extent people were proud.\n\nReagan, in case you forgot, was president for the bulk of the 1980s.\n\nTrump's cultural references are all '80s too. Bob Hope ! Arnold Palmer -and his genitals ! Lee Greenwood. The late great Hannibal Lecter . (OK, Silence of the Lambs came out in 1991 but still...)\n\nThe president's views on the efficacy of tariffs were also formed-and are stuck-in the '80s. Here's Trump talking about how we were getting ripped off on trade with Oprah Winfrey in 1988:\n\nThe problem, as I see it for Trump, is that there's no way we can go back to the American economy of the 1980s. The globalization genie is out of the bottle. We now live in a world of deep economic interconnectedness. I am very skeptical that Trump's tariff policies will reverse engineer almost five decades of such expansion. But make no mistake: That's exactly what Trump wants to do.\n\nHe wants to Make the 1980s Great Again.\n\nWant more ball and strike calling-no matter what uniform the batter at the plate is wearing?

HANG TOUGH, it won't be easy, but the end result will be historic.\n\n\"We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\n\nThe website for the protest said: \"This mass mobilisation day is our message to the world that we do not consent to the destruction of our government and our economy for the benefit of Trump and his billionaire allies.\n\n\"We are marching, rallying, and protesting to demand a stop to the chaos and build and opposition movement against the looting of our country.\"\n\nThe largest event is anticipated in Washington DC, where Democrat members of Congress are scheduled to speak to the crowds.\n\nIt comes as British carmaker Jaguar Land Rover halted its US exports, worth £6.5bn a year, after Mr Trump's 25pc tariffs on car imports came into effect on Thursday.\n\nRead the latest updates below.\n\nThat's all from us on the Business blog today, thank you for joining us.\n\nYou can catch up with all our other economics and business news here .\n\nOrganisers said the protest crowd at the Washington Monument in DC was expected to total 20,000 on Saturday.\n\nThousands of people protested against Donald Trump in European cities on Saturday, ahead of the major US demonstrations taking place today.\n\nHundreds of anti-Trump demonstrators gathered in London's Trafalgar Square on Saturday in an extension of the \"Hands Off!\" protests sweeping across the United States.\n\nSimilar events took place in Paris, Berlin and Frankfurt.\n\nBerlin protestors held placards outside a Tesla showroom calling for Americans living in Germany to demand an \"end to the chaos\" in the US. Placard slogans included: \"Shut up Elon, no one voted for you.\"\n\nElon Musk has said he wants Europe and the US to create a free trade zone spanning the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe billionaire Trump ally said he hoped there would be an agreement for a \"zero tariff situation\" for trade between Europe and America.\n\nMr Musk told Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini on Saturday: \"I hope it is agreed that both Europe and the United States should move ideally, in my view, to a zero-tariff situation, effectively creating a free-trade zone between Europe and North America.\"\n\nDemonstrations are taking place in all of America's 50 states, as well as in Canada and Mexico.\n\nThousands gathered in Asheville's Pack Square in North Carolina, with placards reading \"Save Democracy\" and \"Overthrow the oligarchs.\"\n\nJaguar Land Rover is pausing all shipments to the US, as the carmaker grapples with the impact of Donald Trump's 25pc tariff on foreign cars.\n\nThe move is the clearest example yet of the direct impact on British workers and companies in the wake of a global trade war that has wiped more than $5tn off US stocks in only two days.\n\nThe carmaker, which employs 38,000 people in Britain, will pause car shipments from Monday while working out how to adjust to the price hit to its US exports.\n\nThe Telegraph understands that the pause will last for two weeks.\n\nThe Coventry-based firm sold 430,000 cars in the year to March, with nearly a quarter of its sales generated in the US.\n\nJaguar Land Rover sold £6.5bn worth of cars to the US over that period, the largest of any market.\n\nIt follows warnings that tens of thousands of jobs in the UK car industry are at risk from Mr Trump's tariffs.\n\nThe US President is so far refusing to walk back on the tariffs, insisting instead that \"only the weak will fall\".\n\nIn a statement on Saturday, a spokesperson said: \"The USA is an important market for JLR's luxury brands.\n\n\"As we work to address the new trading terms with our business partners, we are taking some short-term actions including a shipment pause in April, as we develop our mid to longer-term plans.\"\n\nCrowds are gathering for more than 1,000 anti-Donald Trump protests expected across the US today in what is likely to be the largest single day demonstration against the administration since Mr Trump took office.\n\nSome 1,200 \"Hands Off!\" demonstrations are planned across America in a \"mass mobilisation day\" to protest against Mr Trump's economic agenda and aggressive government cuts led by his billionaire ally Elon Musk.\n\nProtestors are already gathering ahead of the largest demonstration in Washington DC, which will kick off at noon ET.\n\nThe demonstration organiser's website said: \"This mass mobilisation day is our message to the world that we do not consent to the destruction of our government and our economy for the benefit of Trump and his billionaire allies.\n\n\"We are marching, rallying, and protesting to demand a stop to the chaos and build and opposition movement against the looting of our country.\"\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron spoke on Saturday to discuss Donald Trump's trade war.\n\nDowning Street said: \"They agreed that a trade war was in nobody's interests, but nothing should be off the table.\n\n\"The prime minister and president also shared their concerns about the global economic and security impact, particularly in Southeast Asia.\"\n\nThe two leaders plan to stay in close contact in the weeks ahead.\n\nSenate Republicans have pushed through their blueprint for tax and spending cuts in a crucial step for Donald Trump.\n\nThe Senate approved the budget plan early on Saturday morning by 51 votes to 48 after an overnight voting marathon on amendments.\n\nIt includes plans to extend Mr Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which is due to expire at the end of the year, and allows for an additional $1.5 trillion in new tax cuts over a decade.\n\nThe blueprint must now be approved by the House before lawmakers can start drawing up legislation.\n\nWarnings are mounting over the huge economic toll that Donald Trump's much larger than expected tariffs will take on America.\n\nPeter Tchir, head of macro strategies at Academy Securities, told Bloomberg:\n\n\"We are rapidly headed towards recession.\n\n\"The world was prepared for 'reciprocal tariffs.' Whatever the abomination that was launched at the Rose Garden was, it is a disaster - mostly for the US, but also for the global economy.\"\n\nAround 6,000 workers in Canada's auto manufacturing sector were hit with temporary layoff notices on the first day of Donald Trump's tariffs on car imports.\n\nEmployees started getting notices from Wednesday night, after the US President confirmed that his 25pc tariffs on all car imports to American would come into effect at midnight, according to Unifor, Canada's largest private sector union.\n\nThe bulk of the temporary redundancies were at a Stellantis plant in Ontario, which is pausing production for two weeks starting on Monday.\n\nAntonio Filosa, Stellantis's chief operating officer for the Americas, told employees: \"With the new automotive sector tariffs now in effect, it will take our collective resilience and discipline to push through this challenging time.\"\n\nDonald Trump urged his supporters to \"hang tough\" amid his \"economic revolution\", reinforcing that he is not for turning despite a global sell-off in equities.\n\nSuch statements are likely to add to growing panic among investors, who are struggling to see a way out of the downturn. It comes as JP Morgan has warned there is now a 60pc chance of a global recession.\n\nThe US President also insisted China is suffering most in the trade war after treating the US \"unsustainably badly\". It comes after China retaliated with 34pc tariffs on Friday and told Trump to listen to the stock markets.\n\nSpain's trade chief has urged Brussels to avoid retaliating against Donald Trump's punitive tariffs, warning the bloc has nothing to gain from a protectionist race to the bottom.\n\nIn remarks that underline the growing divide across the EU, Carlos Cuerpo said: \"We still are calling for a negotiated solution. Increasing tariffs and protectionism is a lose-lose race. We just need to look at the past two days' market reaction, which I think is proving this argument right.\"\n\nIt comes after leaders in France and Germany have threatened a more heavy-handed response to Mr Trump's policies, with outgoing German economy minister Robert Habeck comparing the tariffs with the aggressions against Ukraine.\n\nHe said that as such \"the magnitude and determination of the response must be commensurate.\"\n\nDonald Trump's aggressive trade war is putting an end to decades of free global trade, a member of the European Central Bank has warned.\n\nIsabel Schnabel told a conference in northern Italy on Saturday: \"Liberation day was not liberating, but seems to have marked the end of global free trade.\"\n\nShe added: \"The EU was not born to screw the US, but it was born to make Europe thrive. The best response to geopolitical shifts that we are experiencing is to make Europe stronger.\"\n\nIt comes after Mr Trump placed 20pc trade tariffs on the EU and described the bloc as one of the \"worst offenders\" in taking advantage of the US.\n\nEconomist Nouriel Roubini has warned Donald Trump that he has done more to hurt the dollar's privilege over other currencies than any other leader in more than 50 years.\n\nThe economist known as Dr Doom said the US must not forget it still relies on the \"kindness of strangers\" to fund its deficit.\n\nIt follows other warnings this week that investors could turn their back on the dollar as a safe haven currency.\n\nChina told the US President that \"the market has spoken\", as his aggressive trade tariffs wiped off more than $5tn off global stocks after his so-called Liberation Day.\n\nThe world's second-largest economy called on Donald Trump for \"equal-footed consultation\", after hitting back at the US with 34pc tariffs in retaliation.\n\nChinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun made a Facebook post with a picture of plunging US stock markets and said: \"The market has spoken.\"\n\nHe added: \"Now is the time for the U.S. to stop doing the wrong things and resolve the differences with trading partners through equal-footed consultation.\"\n\nIt comes after Mr Trump on Friday warned that China had \"played it wrong\" by retaliating. Analysts at Citi estimate that the total US tariff rate on Chinese imports is now around 65pc.\n\nTurkish exporters could see a boost from only being hit with 10pc tariffs, the country's vice president claimed on Saturday.\n\nThe levy taking effect today is less punitive than tariffs of up to 50pc facing 57 countries that the US administration describes as the \"worst offenders\", including China, the European Union, Vietnam and Japan.\n\nVice President Cevdet Yilmaz said the lower import levy on Turkey \"seems to be to our advantage as of now, for access to the American market.\"\n\nHe told CNN: \"There were already tariffs on [Turkey's US exports of] iron, steel and aluminium.

For the full year, we now look for real growth of -0.3pc, down from 1.3pc previously.\"\n\nIt comes after China retaliated with tariffs of 34pc on all US imports on Friday, taking the world closer to a full-blown global trade war.\n\nMarkets took fright as Donald Trump vowed his policies would \"never change\", deepening a sell-off that has wiped more than $5tn off US stocks in only a couple of days.\n\nMr Feroli forecasts that the US will spend the second half of this year in recession, in a remarkable turn of events spelling an end to years of strong growth that were the envy of other rich nations.\n\nThe blow to US households from surging prices from costlier imports \"may hit harder than in the post-pandemic inflation spike,\" JP Morgan warned.\n\nThe investment bank predicts unemployment will rise by more than a percentage point to 5.3pc.\n\nIt comes as tariffs of 10pc for nearly all countries took effect after midnight. The levies will then rise further to as high as 50pc for certain nations from April 9.\n\nThe Israeli prime minister is expected to visit the White House on Monday, in what would be the first in-person meeting between Donald Trump and a foreign leader seeking to negotiate the removal of tariffs.\n\nMr Trump surprised his ally in the Middle East with tariffs of 17pc on \"Liberation Day\", in a move that will add further strain on Israel's war economy. The US is Israel's closest ally and largest trading partner.\n\nThe US President extended the invitation to Benjamin Netanyahu during a phone call with the Israeli leader on Thursday, in news first reported by Axios.\n\nThe UK will suffer a larger knock than expected from Donald Trump's tariffs, in a blow to the Chancellor's hopes of staying within her fiscal rules.\n\nJack Meaning at Barclays said the bank had revised down its growth forecasts from 0.7pc to 0.5pc this year, even as the UK managed to avoid the worst of Mr Trump's tariff rises.\n\nHowever, the UK is \"not immune\" from the far larger than expected impact on the rest of the world, with a \"more intense\" global slowdown also impacting British businesses and households.\n\nThe downgrade is problematic for Rachel Reeves, who has left herself what the fiscal watchdog describes as a \"tiny\" margin of error of £9.9bn against her fiscal rules.\n\nThe Office for Budget Responsibility's forecasts hinge on the British economy growing by 1pc this year - half of what Barclays predicts.\n\nIf the Chancellor is again found short of her fiscal rules in autumn, she is widely expected to raise taxes again.\n\nMr Meaning said: \"The imposition on the rest of the world was larger than we had factored in, with the euro area facing an average of over 20pc compared with our prior assumption of 10pc. This leads to a more intense global slowdown, from which the UK is not immune.\n\n\"What is more, the level of trade uncertainty is higher than we had previously assumed it would be, and our modeling suggests this increase could add a drag of as much as 0.4pc to UK GDP growth this year.\"\n\nThe big focus of the weekend will be on how world leaders respond to Donald Trump enacting the most aggressive protectionist US trade agenda in a century.\n\nItalian economy minister Giancarlo Giorgetti on Saturday warned against hitting back at the world's biggest economy with retaliatory tariffs.\n\nMr Giorgetti told a business forum near Milan: \"We should avoid launching a policy of counter-tariffs that could be damaging for everyone and especially for us.\"\n\nIt comes after Trump on Friday said China had \"played it wrong\" by imposing counter tariffs of 34pc on the US.\n\nDonald Trump's tariffs will plunge the eurozone into an immediate three-quarter long recession, analysts at Barclays have warned.\n\nIt means the euro area, which includes economies like France, Germany and Italy, will be in recession for the remainder of 2025.\n\nThe bank has more than halved its growth forecast for this year from 0.7pc to 0.3pc.\n\nIt comes after the US president included the EU on his \"worst offenders\" list, hitting the bloc with tariffs of 20pc. The car industry meanwhile faces import levies of 25pc in a hammer blow to countries like Germany.\n\nBarclays' analysts said:\n\nWe expect a contraction in real GDP growth in Q2, Q3 and Q4 2025, with growth coming back only in 2026, when the impulse from higher defence spending in the euro area and infrastructure spending in Germany should take effect.

      "text": "Tariffs won't make America great again: Export-Import Bank's former chairman and president\n\nManage your account\n\nIn the rush toward what President Trump thinks of as a more realistic and transactional world of dealmaking in diplomacy, he has lost sight of the strategic advantages free trade continues to provide the U.S. While it remains to be seen whether these on-again, off-again tariffs will last, lasting damage has already been done.\n\nAs Trump doubles down on his \"America First\" rhetoric, he is, at best, ignoring the most crucial fact about the American economy: It runs on trade , that is Americans buying imported goods and American companies exporting to the rest of the world. The United States is the number two exporter in the world, which means that retaliatory tariffs will cause tremendous harm to American businesses and farmers and their workers. Our economy is powered not just by physical goods crossing borders, but by a vast service sector that relies on cooperation with other countries. By instigating a trade war against our geographical neighbors, closest allies, and economic partners, Trump risks stopping the engine of American prosperity.\n\nWe're already seeing the consequences of this unpredictable environment play out with our northern neighbor. Canada-historically our closest ally and trading partners-is now being treated like an economic adversary. The result? Disruption to the deeply integrated economies and value chains on both sides of the border.\n\nTake the automotive industry, a cornerstone of North American manufacturing, which stands to suffer significantly. Vehicles and components frequently cross the Canada-Mexico-U.S. border multiple times during production, with supply chains carefully optimized over decades. A 25% tariff could inflate the price of a new vehicle by as much as $12,000 . This not only hurts American consumers, but also puts thousands of jobs at risk.\n\nNAFTA, the predecessor to the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement, was originally proposed by Trump's political idol Ronald Reagan, who correctly thought the U.S. needed a way to compete with an integrated European market. One of NAFTA's follow-on effects has been allowing U.S. companies to compete with Asian automakers. By abandoning free trade, we abandon these long-term advantages, with no new strategic advantages to replace them, only Trump's vague promises of a slate of better bi-lateral deals. As the car industry may go, so other industries may follow.\n\nBeyond manufacturing, Trump's tariffs will hurt a range of industries, from agriculture to technology. American farmers, already struggling with challenging market conditions, now face the prospect of losing access to crucial export markets. Meanwhile, innovative tech companies may find themselves cut off from global talent pools and collaborative research opportunities.\n\nTrump has said he wants to make the U.S. more open to foreign direct investment (FDI). The bitter irony is that the chaos caused by his proposed tariffs is likely to discourage it. As Dave Cote once famously said, \"capital is a coward,\" meaning that investment always flows toward safety and predictability. Faced with Trump's chaos and unpredictability, other nations looking to do business in North America may now choose to locate elsewhere, taking jobs and economic growth with them.\n\nThe near daily drama on proposed tariffs also distracts voters and policymakers from more effective ways to boost American competitiveness. Instead of erecting trade barriers, we should be investing in education, infrastructure, and research and development. These are the undisputed foundations of long-term economic growth and innovation-areas where America has historically excelled.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent's recent comment that \"access to cheap goods is not the essence of the American dream\" entirely misses the point of free trade. So-called cheap goods are no trivial thing. Lower prices for food, clothing, and other essentials have alleviated economic pressure on American families for decades, and they have raised our collective standard of living and for many years helped keep inflation in check. That is, in fact, the essence of the American dream. Putting America first should mean having trade policies that consider the real interests of U.S. consumers, and not allegiance to an unproven, extreme ideology of purely transactional trade and diplomacy.\n\nInstead, we should redefine what \"America First\" should really mean: fostering fair and transparent relationships, investing in our workforce and infrastructure, doubling down on innovation, and using trade to deepen our relationships with those long-standing allies in Europe and East Asia who share our values. When we build bridges to our allies, not walls, everyone stands to benefit.\n\nThe opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune.\n\nTrump is knowingly steering the economy off the cliff with tariffs\n\nTrump's tariffs are flawed and contradictory -and the 'Mar-a-Lago accord' is suited for the trash bin\n\nTrump tariffs : Stealing from the China playbook-to boost car making in America\n\nTrump's tariffs program is based on flawed assumptions about the trade deficit\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

      "text": "Trump official admits US workers won't get jobs in new factories spurred by tariff strategy\n\nManage your account\n\nDonald Trump 's secretary of Commerce seemingly admitted on Sunday that US workers would not see long-lost manufacturing jobs return as a result of the president's new tariff strategy, which places duties on nearly all US imports.\n\nHoward Lutnick appeared on CBS's Face the Nation on Sunday and promised that \"trillions\" of dollars would flow into the US in the form of new investments in America's manufacturing sector. Margaret Brennan, the show's host, questioned whether those factories would be \"automated\", as Lutnick had said previously.\n\nPointing out that the construction of new factories \"takes years\" and will do nothing to bring down costs of consumer goods for Americans in the short term, Brennan added: \"You said that robots are going to fill those jobs. So those aren't union worker jobs.\"\n\n\"It's automated factories,\" Lutnick conceded, while promising that American workers would build and \"operate\" the factories brought to US shores in the coming months and years.\n\nLutnick went on to portray the automization of iPhone assembly as one of the benefits of the president's plan, claiming that the \"army\" of \"millions\" currently employed in Apple's factories overseas would no longer be part of the process. America, he said, would see an explosion of mid-level trade employment opportunities including \"mechanics\", \"HVAC technicians\" and more in support of this hypothetical surge in growth of US manufacturing.\n\nHe, like other Trump officials and the president himself have portrayed the development of manufacturing capabilities in America as an issue of national security - with heavy tariffs a means of forcing that private sector investment to take place. Critics, however, have pointed to several factors as reasons for doubting that strategy, including most obviously the on-again-off-again nature of the president's tariff announcements over the past few months.\n\nEven as Trump administration officials hit the Sunday interview circuit this weekend, none could say for sure whether some or all of the tariffs announced as part of the president's \"Liberation Day\" agenda were temporary, or whether foreign leaders would be able to reach an agreement with the US to reduce trade barriers. The president has indicated that the barriers are permanent, while several in his Cabinet have intimated otherwise.\n\nThe president himself told Americans in a social media post on Saturday: \"THIS IS AN ECONOMIC REVOLUTION, AND WE WILL WIN. HANG TOUGH, it won't be easy, but the end result will be historic. We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\"\n\nUnnerving some, he also reposted one supporter's claim that a stock market crash was intentional - part of a plan to help the Federal Reserve refinance America's debt.\n\nThe White House battled a wave of negative headlines surrounding two days of steep market losses and the criticism of free trade advocates in both parties who claim that the president's actions will crash the US economy. Markets closed down on Friday after suffering the worst sustained losses over two days since the summer of Covid in 2020.\n\nMany believe the losses will continue through this week as China and other countries announce their own tariff hikes in response to the president's actions."

      "text": "Trump's tariffs are a longtime goal fulfilled - and his biggest gamble yet\n\nDonald Trump's politics have shifted considerably over his decades in the public sphere. But one thing he has been consistent on, since the 1980s, is his belief that tariffs are an effective means of boosting the US economy.\n\nNow, he's staking his presidency on his being right.\n\nAt his Rose Garden event at the White House, surrounded by friends, conservative politicians and cabinet secretaries, Trump announced sweeping new tariffs on a broad range of countries - allies, competitors and adversaries alike.\n\nIn a speech that was equal parts celebration and self-congratulation, regularly punctuated by applause from the crowd, the president recalled his longtime support of tariffs, as well as his early criticism of free trade agreements like Nafta and the World Trade Organization.\n\nThe president acknowledged that he will face pushback in the coming days from \"globalists\" and \"special interests\", but he urged Americans to trust his instincts.\n\n\"Never forget, every prediction our opponents made about trade for the last 30 years has been proven totally wrong,\" he said.\n\nNow, in a second term in which he is surrounded by like-minded advisers and is the dominant force in a Republican Party that controls both chambers of Congress, Trump is in a position to turn his vision of a new America-focused trade policy into reality. These policies, he said, had made the United States into a wealthy nation more than a century ago and would again.\n\n\"For years, hard working American citizens were forced to sit on the sidelines as other nations got rich and powerful, much of it at our expense,\" he said. \"With today's action, we are finally going to be able to make America great again - greater than ever before.\"\n\nIt is still an enormous risk for this president to take.\n\nEconomists of all stripes warn that these massive tariffs - 53% on China, 20% on the European Union and South Korea, with a 10% baseline on all nations - will be passed along to American consumers, raising prices and threatening a global recession.\n\nKen Rogoff, the former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, predicted that the chances of the US, the world's largest economy, falling into recession had risen to 50% on the back of this announcement.\n\n\"He just dropped a nuclear bomb on the global trading system,\" Mr Rogoff told the BBC World Service, adding that the consequences for this level of taxes on imports into the US \"is just mind-boggling\".\n\nTrump's move also risks escalating a trade war with other countries and alienating allies that America has otherwise tried to strengthen ties with. The US, for instance, sees Japan and South Korea as a bulwark against Chinese expansionist ambitions. But those three countries recently announced that they would work together to respond to America's trade policies.\n\nIf Trump is successful, however, he would fundamentally reshape a global economic order that America had originally helped to construct from the ashes of World War 2. He promises that this will rebuild American manufacturing, create new sources of revenue, and make America more self-reliant and insulated from the kind of global supply chain shocks that wreaked havoc on the US during the Covid pandemic.\n\nIt's a tall order - and one that many believe to be highly unrealistic. But for a president who seems fixated on cementing his legacy, whether through ending wars, renaming geographic locations, acquiring new territory or dismantling federal programmes and its workforce, this is the biggest, most consequential prize to be won.\n\nIt would be, he styled, America's \"liberation day\".\n\nWhat appears clear, however, is that Wednesday's announcement, if he follows through, is almost certain to mark a historic change. The question is whether it will be a legacy of achievement or one of notoriety.\n\nTrump's speech was triumphant - one that belied the potentially high costs his moves would impose on the American economy and on his own political standing.\n\nBut, he said, it was worth it - even if, at the very end of his remarks, a small shadow of presidential doubt may have peeked through the bravado.\n\n\"It's going to be a day that - hopefully - you're going to look back in years to come and you're going to say, you know, he was right.\"\n\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

      "text": "Trump's move to dismantle education department was a conservative dream for decades\n\nAs he strode into Congress for his State of the Union speech in 1982, US President Ronald Reagan was prepared to deliver a message that resonated with many Republicans: let's end the Department of Education.\n\n\"We must cut out non-essential government spending,\" Reagan told lawmakers, vowing to cull the wider federal workforce by 75,000.\n\nFor 43 years, that vision for abolishing the education department - backed by members chafing at \"big government\" control over state issues - went unrealised.\n\nBut now, Donald Trump is attempting just that , through an executive order that instructs his Education Secretary Linda McMahon to take \"all necessary steps\" to shutter the department and \"return education authority to the states\", according to a White House-provided fact sheet.\n\nTrump has already moved to lay off half of the agency's workforce. While closing the department outright would require an act of Congress, a political longshot, the president can take steps to break up the department and narrow its remit.\n\nIf ultimately successful, he would fulfil a campaign promise and long-running policy that has united disparate groups within the Republican Party, ranging from establishment Republicans and evangelical Christians to the Make America Great Again wing of the party that is most aligned with Trump.\n\nTrump's executive order cites a number of reasons for dismantling the department, including $3tn (£2.3tn) spent \"without improving student achievement\", plummeting test scores, excessive \"ideological initiatives\" and a return of control to the states \"where it belongs\".\n\nJonathan Butcher, an education policy veteran with experience in South Carolina, Arkansas and Arizona, told the BBC that these reasons, broadly, are ones shared by various factions of the Republican Party - and have been for years.\n\n\"Reagan correctly saw the philosophical and practical point that when you create an agency in Washington, it only grows in size and assumes additional responsibilities,\" said Mr Butcher, now a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that has long called for the abolition of the department.\n\n\"And sure enough, that's what the US Department of Education has done,\" he added.\n\nWhile the first US Department of Education was established by President Andrew Johnson in the wake of the American Civil War in 1867, it soon shrank and faded into relative obscurity, housed under various names and agencies.\n\nOver a century later, the now-cabinet level department was revived under Democrat Jimmy Carter in 1979 - immediately drawing the ire of Republicans such as Reagan.\n\nDuring his victorious campaign to become president, Reagan described the department as a \"new bureaucratic boondoggle\" that allowed Washington, rather than \"local needs and preferences\", to determine how American children were to be educated.\n\nSimilar arguments were made by Republicans during subsequent administrations, although a lack of congressional support long made efforts to dismantle or eliminate the agency impossible.\n\n\"I do not believe we need a federal department of homework checkers,\" then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich told the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities in 1995.\n\nGingrich, who was one of only a small number of Republican lawmakers to support the department's original creation, added that it had become a \"massive disappointment\".\n\nWhile many of the same arguments are being made today, some experts point to heightened \"culture wars\" - a hallmark of US politics in recent years - as having breathed new life into efforts to scuttle the department.\n\n\"What I think is so unifying for the right is that there was always a sense that it offered a kind of one-stop access for the education 'blob' to influence policy,\" said Frederick Hess, director of education policy at the American Enterprise Institute, another Washington-based think tank. \"That has been part of the critique going back to Reagan.\"\n\n\"But the department had never been as forcefully involved in ferocious national culture battles,\" Mr Hess added.\n\n\"While there are a lot of reasons those on the right might want to see the department downsized or abolished... this has given it all a new energy and focus that has really changed it from a talking point and given it another level of import.\"\n\nExperts, however, warn that there remains significant misunderstanding of what the department actually does , and the federal government's power to influence educational outcomes.\n\nUnlike the UK's Department for Education, for example, its US counterpart takes no part in laying out national curricula, which it leaves to the states. It contributes only a small fraction of funding for student spending when compared to state-level counterparts.\n\nIt does, however, administer student loan programmes and Pell grants that help low-income students attend university - which the White House says that it will continue to do even once largely dismantled.\n\nMr Hess, for his part, compared the department to a \"McGuffin\" - a plot device famously used by Alfred Hitchcock to develop a character's plot arc, while at the same time being largely irrelevant.\n\n\"There absolutely is an enormous amount of red-tape and regulation that gets in the way of schools, abolishing the department doesn't get rid of that red tape and regulation,\" he said. \"These are baked into law.\"\n\nAs an example, Mr Hess pointed to programmes such as Pell grants or Title I, a federal initiative to provide funding to schools with large numbers of low-income students.\n\n\"Even if you downsize the department, all of those requirements are still in place. You need to actively shave down the requirements and regulations or re-write the law in order to make a significant difference,\" Mr Hess said.\n\nAlready, the Trump administration's efforts to slash the size of the department have been the subject of lawsuits, and the new executive order has already faced fierce criticism from Democratic lawmakers who say it endangers student education and jeapordises school funding and financial aid.\n\nThe truth, Mr Hess said, is likely somewhere in the middle of the opposing sides.\n\n\"Both sides are, for different reasons, overstating the importance of downsizing or abolishing the department, and neither side is paying as much attention to the stuff that would really fundamentally change federal education,\" he added.\n\nBut for those supportive of the move, Trump's efforts are the fulfilment of a campaign promise.\n\n\"On the campaign trail, he [Trump] said it was a priority for states, not the federal government,\" said Mr Butcher of the Heritage Foundation .\n\n\"While a move towards efficiency and streamlining, it would really do more for state's autonomy... it's a much deeper issue than a financial one.\"\n\nThe drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a \"severe infection\", her family says.\n\nJens-Frederick Nielsen says the island must \"stand together\" with Denmark during a highly symbolic visit to Copenhagen.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nThe prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein and the Duke of York has died at the age of 41.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

Passengers fought back and prevented the plane being crashed into a government building in Washington. All 40 aboard died.\n\nBiden greeted firefighters and paid respects at a cross made from the broken fuselage.\n\nFootage inside the fire station posted to social media shows Biden chatting with people and interacting with a man wearing a red hat with \"Trump 2024\" emblazoned on the front.\n\nBiden offers the man a hat with the presidential seal on it, saying he would autograph it.\n\nAfter some joking about his age, Biden hands the man the autographed cap and offers to trade it for the Trump hat.\n\nSeveral of those gathered call on him to put it on, to which he shouts: \"I ain't going that far!\" before putting it on, to loud cheers.\n\nThe White House later explained it was a way to underline the unity theme of the day.\n\n\"As a gesture, he gave a hat to a Trump supporter who then said that in the  same spirit, POTUS should put on his Trump cap,\" deputy Press Secretary Andrew Bates wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nThe daughter of the man who swapped hats with the president said Biden kept the Trump hat after the interaction.\n\n\"My pap don't care who it is,\" Kelsey Simmers told the BBC. \"He likes to joke and have fun.\"\n\nShe said that her father ended up getting another cap from the Trump campaign after they reached out.\n\nThe incident happened hours after Trump had joked on the debate stage about sending Vice-President Kamala Harris a Make America Great Again hat.\n\nAged just 10 when his father first became president, he's now well over six feet tall, and goes to New York University.\n\nThe US president spoke about his plans for the second Trump administration, as well as criticising the 'corrupt establishment'.\n\nWatch the historic moment when the 45th president is returned to power as he takes the oath of office.\n\nElon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos were among those invited inside the Capitol for Donald Trump's swearing in.\n\nThousands of people joined in on demonstrations as the United States prepares to inaugurate its new president.\n\nThe outgoing US president warned against power in the hands of the wealthy, the threat of the tech industry and climate change.\n\nTrump's pick for US attorney general was pressed on claims of election fraud and pardons for January 6 rioters.\n\nDonald Trump's defence secretary nominee was asked about his stance on women in combat and his alleged excessive drinking.\n\nHarris, who Trump defeated in the 2024 election, presided over the event as required by the US Constitution.\n\nAmong the allies the president-elect has chosen to join his administration are contentious figures, including among fellow Republicans.\n\nThe president-elect has nominated RFK to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe suspect used an \"improvised incendiary device\" to start the fire in Portland, Oregon, ahead of the US election.\n\nA week after losing the election, Kamala Harris's team are still appealing for funds.\n\nRepublicans have won control of both chambers of Congress, yielding Trump limited congressional oversight for at least 2 years.\n\nThe president and president-elect shook hands as part of a long-standing tradition signifying the transfer of power.\n\nGiven all the things they've said about each other, Joe Biden and Donald Trump's meeting could be really awkward.\n\n'I think Putin believes that he knows how to play Trump', says Trump's former adviser John Bolton.\n\nThe Russian president says he was impressed by Trump's reaction to the first assassination attempt against him.\n\nThe president addressed Americans from the White House for the first time since Donald Trump's election victory.\n\nAfter Donald Trump's decisive victory, we asked Americans what they think made the difference for each campaign.\n\nTasked with reducing government spending and cutting jobs, the agency has faced legal challenges.\n\nThe conspiracy theorist reportedly urged Trump to fire several National Security Council officials, a claim denied by the president.\n\nThe Vances met as students, when they joined a discussion group on \"social decline in white America\".\n\nIndian Americans are optimistic about India's future, but wary of US-India ties under a second Trump term.\n\nThe conservative from Ohio shot to fame writing about his hard upbringing and is now next in line to the US presidency.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

The inauguration tomorrow marks the beginning of the \"golden age of America\", he tells the crowd.\n\nHe describes four years of \"weakness\", \"pain\", \"suffering\" and \"unprotected open borders\", to boos from the crowd at each insult of the Democrats' time in office.\n\nIt's \"all going to end\" tomorrow, he says, adding that on Monday Trump will sign an executive order \"ending the border invasion, sending the illegals home and taking America back\", to loud cheers from the crowd.\n\nHe ends by saying the American people \"won\" and \"still control this country\" to more loud cheers and screams.\n\nActor Jon Voight - who Trump recently named as one of his special ambassadors to Hollywood - is now addressing the crowd.\n\nVoight calls Trump's defeat of US President Biden \"the greatest win of all time\".\n\n\"He will make America thrive again. He will make America great again, safe again and we the people will honour our flag again,\" he says of the president-elect.\n\n\"A man who never gave up on the American people. And we the people never gave up on him,\" he says.\n\nKid Rock has just wrapped his performance of All Summer Long.\n\nWe're now hearing Trump's voice broadcast throughout the arena, praising the singer.\n\n\"All of you in attendance are the true backbone of our great country,\" he says.\n\n\"Let's make America rock again,\" Trump closes, his voice being remixed as a segue into Kid Rock's next song.\n\nThe musician is now performing his second song, with the refrain \"we the people, let's go Brandon\" â an anti-Biden heckle .\n\nHis lyrics are a commentary on the current affairs in the US.\n\n\"Inflation is up like the minimum wage, but that BS is about to change,\" Kid Rock sings.\n\n\"It's time for love and unity\".\n\nAfter an impassioned prayer for Donald Trump, musician Kid Rock takes the stage for the first performance of the night.\n\nThe musician is wearing a black fur jacket, a black hat and sunglasses. He kicks his set of with a rendition of his hit song, All Summer Long and tears off his jacket to reveal a black vest.\n\nHalfway through the song, he swaps his black hat for a red \"Make America Great Again\" cap.\n\nThe Maga rally is now beginning, about 30 minutes later than its scheduled start time.\n\nTo kick things off, a singer takes the stage for a performance of the national anthem.\n\nThe crowd responds by chanting \"USA!\"\n\nSumi Somaskanda Chief presenter, in Washington DC\n\nThousands of people\nhave packed into the arena â some have come from across the country and beyond\nfor inauguration ceremonies.\n\nWe spoke to a group\nof Canadians sporting \"Maple Syrup Maga\" sweatshirts who said they came to\nsupport the president-elect because they believe their country needs his\npolicies as well â a stronger military, less immigration, and fighting what\nthey called a âglobalistâ agenda.\n\nThey donât,\nhowever, believe Canada should join the US, despite Trumpâs jokes about the\ncountry becoming the 51st state. âItâs fun to think about though,â\nthey quipped.\n\nTrump's victory rally in Washington DC was due to begin at 15:00 EST (20:00 GMT), but the event does not appear to have started yet.\n\nLarge numbers are now inside the 20,000-capacity venue, but we're still awaiting our first act or speaker.\n\nWarm-up music is playing, though. So far, the songs have included Luke Combs' When It Rains It Pours, The Clash's Should I Stay or Should I Go, and The Weeknd's Starboy.\n\nWhile wait for the rally to get going, here are some more images from both inside and outside the Capital One Arena in DC, which is now packed with Trump supporters here to make the most of the eve of his inauguration:\n\nThe \"Make America Great Again Victory Rallyâ is due to start any moment.\n\nThe event is being held in a 20,000-capacity arena, and is due to feature musical performers and speeches from high-profile Trump backers.\n\nVice-President-elect JD Vance and billionaire Elon Musk are among those expected to address the crowd, US media reports.\n\nTrump himself has not made a large public address in Washington since 6 January 2021, shortly before his supporters stormed the Capitol.\n\nWe'll be covering the event live on this page - follow along by hitting watch live above.\n\nSumi Somaskanda Chief presenter, in Washington DC\n\nWeâre in the Capital One Arena where Donald Trump is holding his Make America Great Again\nVictory Rally.\n\nItâs not common for a president-elect to hold such an event the\nday before inauguration â but for Trump, this was an opportunity to put on a\ncampaign-style mass rally before he assumes the duties of the presidency again.\n\nDespite the\nsleet and icy temperatures, the president-electâs supporters have been in high\nspirts and waiting patiently for hours in long lines amid heightened security\nto access the arena.\n\nElon Musk\nand Vice President-elect JD Vance are expected to speak.\n\nAnd the Village\nPeople will perform their iconic hit âYMCA,â which has become an anthem for\nDonald Trump and his supporters â the president-elect often dances when the\nsong is played, and we saw some of his supporters mimicking the dance today as\nthe band was warming up.\n\nKid Rock\nwill also take the stage. Donning a backwards âMake America Great Againâ hat,\nhe tells the BBC heâs âfeeling greatâ and will spend inauguration day in his\nhotel room with \"eggs, bacon, and a 40-oz beer\" before heading to the\ninauguration ball in the evening.\n\nEmily Atkinson Live editor, in Washington DC\n\nIt's due to get bitterly cold here in Washington DC over the next few days. To make the most of the comparatively balmy 3C (37F) temperatures, I decided to forego the subway and make the hour-long walk to our office here instead.\n\nDowntown DC has been relatively calm since I arrived in the city just over a week ago. But today, it appeared transformed.\n\nTen minutes in and every other person I encountered was wearing a red \"Make America Great Again\" (Maga) cap. The other half were donning some alternative Trump merch - t-shirts, badges, scarves, embossed jackets. I could go on.\n\nThe crowd of thousands was streaming over to the Capital One Arena, where Trump's rally is due to take place this afternoon.\n\nI spoke to two women in matching \"Trump 2024\" beanies who had travelled to the city from Oklahoma. One of the pair, Madison, was also wearing a set of red, white and blue earrings. I asked her about their significance.\n\n\"They're my 4 July earrings,\" she explained. \"I'm wearing them because tomorrow will be a new independence day.\"\n\nArmy vehicles and personnel are also stationed around the city. The atmosphere does not feel fraught, however - if anything, it resembles something closer to a carnival, with jubilant supporters honking their horns and waving US flags as they make their way through the city.\n\nThe rally is slated to start at 15:00 EST (20:00 GMT) . Stay with us.\n\nBiden at the Royal Missionary Baptist Church in North Charleston, South Carolina\n\nJoe Biden is spending his last full day as president in South Carolina â a state that helped propel him to victory in 2020.\n\nHe has been paying tribute to Martin Luther King Jr ahead of Monday's public holiday devoted to the civil rights leader.\n\nAnd Biden will also visit the International African American Museum.\n\nIn one of his final acts, the outgoing president has also pardoned five people, including the late civil rights leader Marcus Garvey, and commuted the sentences of two people.\n\nGarvey, who died in 1940, was a Jamaican-born black nationalist whose conviction in 1923 was believed to be politically motivated.\n\nA âMake America Great Again Victory Rallyâ is being held in Washington DC today, with a number of close allies of the president-elect due to speak.\n\nItâs being held in the Capital One Arena, a venue in central Washington DC with a capacity of around 20,000. It's known for hosting a range of events and acts as the home stadium for the areaâs national sports teams.\n\nItâs due to start at 15:00 EST (20:00 GMT) , and has been billed as a âvictory rally you'll never forgetâ.\n\nAn official speakers list has not been released, but US media has reported that Vice-President-elect JD Vance, billionaire Elon Musk, and professional wrestler Hulk Hogan are among those due to address the crowd.\n\nWe can bring you pictures now of Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance at Arlington National Cemetery, where they are taking part in a wreath-laying ceremony.\n\nThe cemetery, just outside of Washington DC, holds a special place in US politics and culture as a symbol of service and sacrifice, and is the final resting place of around 400,000 veterans and their dependents.\n\nBefore today's rally, Donald Trump is set to visit Arlington Cemetery with Vice-President elect JD Vance for a wreath-laying ceremony.\n\nSeveral of his family members have been photographed waiting for their arrival, umbrellas in tow:\n\nIvanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner arrive at the cemetary\n\nDonald Trump Jr and his family have also been spotted in the crowd\n\nDonald Trump's supporters are out in force on the streets of Washington DD, with a large rally planned for later today.\n\nHere's a look at the scenes close to where the rally is due to begin at 15:00 EST (20:00 GMT).\n\nBen Hatton Live reporter, in Washington DC\n\nHello from the BBC bureau in Washington DC. Weâre now less than 24 hours from Donald Trump being sworn in as the 47th president of the United States.\n\nThe president-elect's supporters are continuing to pour into the capital ahead of the big day despite much of the pageantry being cancelled or moved indoors due to the incoming cold weather.\n\nA âMake America Great Again Victory Rallyâ is being held at a 20,000-capacity venue in the city today, with a number of Trump's close allies and supporters due to speak.\n\nAnd although heâs not officially in the job yet, Trump already appears to have secured a change in policy, with social media app TikTok saying it will restore its services in the US after the president-elect promised protections for companies that allow it continue operating.\n\nWeâll be bringing you all the latest throughout the day â stay with us.\n\nEmily Atkinson Live editor, in Washington DC\n\nThousands of people descended on the US capital today in a wide-ranging show of resistance to the policies of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nCompared to previous marches, today's was relatively small - groups, made up mainly of women, gathered at various points around Washington, and coalesced on the National Mall to make their final stand.\n\nProtests aside, the city is a hive of activity. Since it was announced the inauguration was being moved inside due to the cold weather, last-minute efforts to reshape events to suit the Capitol interior have ramped up.\n\nThat doesn't mean the outside isn't getting equal attention - metal barriers stretching as far as the eye can see are lining just about every street in central DC, and more are being erected as I type.\n\nJudging by the swelling numbers arriving ahead of the big day - and with all the central hotels now fully booked - people appear undeterred by the descending chill.\n\nIndeed, sourcing extra layers won't be an issue for the Trump-loyal, with makeshift stalls piled high with \"Make America Great Again\" (Maga) caps, t-shirts and hoodies popping up all over the city.\n\nTomorrow is the eve of Trump's inauguration.\n\nA rally has been organised to mark the occasion, with Elon Musk and Hulk Hogan slated to speak alongside the president-elect to the crowds of supporters that have made the trip to share in this historic moment.\n\nWe'll be back tomorrow to cover all the action with live updates and analysis. Join us then.\n\nWe'll be ending our live coverage shortly. Before we go, here's a whip around of anything you might have missed from across the day:\n\nOn Monday, Donald Trump will reclaim the Oval Office for his second term as president of the United States.\n\nHe's promised big changes for the world's largest economy.\n\nAn \"end to the devastating inflation crisis\", tariffs and big cuts to taxes, regulation and the size of government are all on the agenda.\n\nThis combination, he says, will ignite an economic boom and revive withering faith in the American dream.\n\nBut looming over the president-elect are warnings that many of his policies are more likely to hurt the economy than help it.\n\nAnd as he prepares to set his plans in motion, analysts say he is about to run into political and economic realities that will make it hard to deliver all his promises.\n\nCopyright Â© 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Musk wields his Doge chainsaw - but is a backlash brewing?\n\nWearing a black \"Make America Great Again\" hat and dark sunglasses, Elon Musk - the multi-billionaire tasked by Donald Trump with taking a metaphorical chainsaw to the federal government - received a rock-star welcome as he took the stage at a right-wing gathering on Thursday.\n\nHe even had a literal chainsaw.\n\nAs the crowd of several thousand cheered, Argentine President Javier Milei, also a favourite at the annual Cpac event, emerged from backstage. He handed Musk a shiny chainsaw with \"viva la Libertad carajo! - Spanish for \"Long live liberty, damn it!\"-  emblazoned on the blade.\n\nMusk waved the power tool high, shouting: \"This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy! Chainsaw!\"\n\nIt was a remarkable moment on a day typified by less animated speeches about the dangers of big government and the accomplishments of Trump's first month back in the White House. It demonstrated how Musk is the only conservative who approaches Trump's ability to energise a crowd.\n\nOutside of Washington, however, there are signs that Musk's chainsaw approach to federal government - which includes shuttering agencies, defunding programmes and mass civil service layoffs - may be cutting too close to the bone.\n\nAt about the same time as Musk was celebrating the work of his so-called \"Department of Government Efficiency\" at the event near Washington DC, Republican congressman Rich McCormick was holding a town hall forum for his constituents.\n\nMany in Roswell, Georgia, were angry about the impact of the Musk-inspired cuts and let the congressman know it.\n\n\"Congress controls the budget, not the president,\" a woman said. \"You are doing a disservice to set that down and not stand up for us.\"\n\nMcCormick's response was drowned out by jeers.\n\n\"I understand trying to do more with less - that's reasonable,\" another constituent said. \"What's not reasonable is taking this chainsaw approach.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Pew Research found that 54% of Americans have an unfavourable view of Musk, including 37% that responded \"very unfavourable\".\n\nOnly 23% of Americans told Reuters-Ipsos pollsters this week that the president has the right to fire \"any federal employee who disagrees with the president\". Fifty-eight percent said they were concerned that popular government programmes, like Social Security retirement benefits for the elderly and subsidised student loans - could be affected.\n\nJust over half of Americans in a CNN poll said Trump had gone \"too far\" in exercising his presidential power.\n\nAt an earlier event at Cpac on Thursday, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson praised Musk and his team.\n\n\"They are exposing this massive fraud, waste and abuse that we have not been able to uncover because the deep state has hidden it from us,\" he said.\n\nMany Republicans have agreed with this sentiment, even if it means ceding congressional power over government spending to the president. Congressional conservatives have been trying to downsize the federal government for decades with limited effectiveness - and now Musk and Trump are delivering, albeit through a sweeping expansion of executive power.\n\nNorth Carolina Senator Thom Tillis told CBS News he believed Doge's approach was necessary because Republicans had failed to get legitimate answers from bureaucrats about how to make government more efficient.\n\n\"And the way to force people to justify investments on exceptions is to shut everything down,\" Tillis said. \"I know it's disruptive, but I think they need to have the capacity to bring things back online that make sense.\"\n\nThat may change, however, if Trump's poll numbers - which have dipped slightly recently - continue to decline and if Republican legislators are challenged by constituents at town hall meetings or have their offices flooded with angry calls.\n\nMembers of Congress across the US have begun stepping forward to defend federal programmes - including funding for academic research, agriculture, veterans services and national parks - that have been affected by Musk's \"Department of Government Efficiency\" actions.\n\nSenator Katie Britt of Alabama called for a \"smart, targeted approach\" to cuts that could target health research conducted in her home state. Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski, a moderate Republican, complained on social media that many of the proposed layoffs \"will do more harm than good\".\n\n\"I share the administration's goal of reducing the size of the federal government,\" she wrote on X, \"but this approach is bringing confusion, anxiety and now trauma to our civil servants.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has already walked back some of its announced layoffs in key sectors - including Department of Energy employees who handle nuclear weapons security, Department of Agriculture teams tasked with containing the recent outbreak of bird flu, and workers in a programme that monitors the health of first responders and survivors of the 11 September World Trade Center attack.\n\n\"I think many of these firings are indiscriminate,\" said Susan Collins of Maine, another centrist Republican senator. \"The fact that workers were let go who are working on avian flu, and the fact that workers have also been fired who are responsible for nuclear safety, shows that we need a far more careful approach.\"\n\nAt his appearance last week at the White House, Musk acknowledged that his team might make mistakes in its eagerness to slash government spending - \"but we will act quickly to correct any mistakes\", he promised.\n\nThat may be cold comfort for Americans adversely affected by the Doge chainsaw, however.\n\nAnd it could come at a political price.\n\nHistory has shown that even when mistakes are fixed, voters often remember these kind of missteps the next time they head to the polls.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nBBC Verify has looked at the agency's biggest claimed savings, examining the figures and speaking to experts.\n\nSantos' downfall included him being the first member of Congress to be expelled in more than 20 years.\n\nThe former US senator offers some typically frank advice as he urges his old party to work with the president.\n\nBoeing's boss says it's looking to sell 50 more planes China has on order to other countries.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

The billionaire posted increasingly positive messages on X - which he owns - throughout the night.\n\nTrump swept several of the key battleground states, with CBS projecting that he has won in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia and North Carolina - and appears to be on track for a clean sweep of all seven swing states that were crucial for a win.\n\nProjections suggest he is likely to win the overall popular vote nationally - a feat he fell short of when first elected in 2016.\n\nTrump also has a solid lead in Nevada, while the race remains tight in the other Sun Belt battleground of Arizona.\n\nAs expected, Trump has dominated conservative strongholds from Florida to Idaho, while Harris won liberal states from New York to California, CBS projects.\n\nThe Democrat had been expected to address a crowd on election night at Howard University in Washington DC, where she was an undergraduate, but it emerged after midnight that she would not appear as her prospects of victory receded.\n\nHarris called Trump to concede on Wednesday afternoon and will return to Howard to make a public concession speech at 16:00 EST (21:00 GMT).\n\nCBS exit poll data suggests Vice-President Harris - who was hoping to become America's first woman president and campaigned heavily for abortion rights - may have under-performed with women.\n\nSome 54% of female voters cast their ballots for her, the numbers indicate. But Joe Biden won the support of 57% of women in 2020.\n\nBlack and Latino voters also appeared slightly less likely to support Harris than they were to back Biden four years ago, according to Associated Press exit poll data.\n\nInstead, Trump swept the key battleground states and smashed the Democrats' once vaunted \"Blue Wall\" of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.\n\nHe becomes the oldest man to take the presidency. The Republican has refused to release his medical records, despite spending much of his early campaign attacking President Joe Biden's advancing age.\n\nIn what will be a major boost for the Trump presidency, Republicans have won control of the Senate after wresting three seats in West Virginia, Montana and Ohio from the Democrats and seeing off a competitive challenger in Texas.\n\nNeither party seemed to have an overall edge in the House, which Republicans narrowly control.\n\nHowever, control of Congress would allow Trump a relatively easy path to pass his key proposals through the legislature - including his pledges to enforce mass deportations of illegal migrants and to enact sweeping tax cuts.\n\nHe has also vowed to drastically reshape the federal government - pledging to dismiss thousands of career civil servants and replace them with political appointees. At his rally in Florida, Trump said he had won \"an unprecedented and powerful mandate\" to impose that agenda.\n\nAround 86 million voters cast their ballots early amid one of the most turbulent campaigns in recent American history.\n\nHarris, 60, only became the Democratic Party candidate in July, after Biden withdrew from the race under pressure from within the party.\n\nTrump's victory marks a dramatic reversal in fortunes for the billionaire. He left office in 2021 with plummeting approval ratings and the country reeling following the Capitol riot - which saw his supporters attempt to violently block certification of his loss to Joe Biden.\n\nHe narrowly avoided conviction in the Senate after becoming the first president to be impeached twice by the US House. The Republican leader in the Senate - Mitch McConnell - said Trump had \"provoked\" his supporters into attacking the Capitol.\n\nHe later became the first former president to be convicted of a criminal offence, after being found guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records.\n\nBut he announced his return to frontline politics in November 2022, beginning the campaign that would eventually see him sweep aside challengers in the Republican primaries and claim his party's nomination for president.\n\nHis campaign for the White House has been fought in stark terms, frequently attacking his opponents - first Biden, then Harris - in personal terms.\n\nOften repeating his false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him, Trump vowed to his supporters that he would be their \"justice\" and \"retribution\" if returned to office.\n\nHe also painted an image of the US as a country overrun by illegal immigration and lumbered with a crumbling economy, often in highly charged language.\n\nOver the course of the campaign he was the target of two assassination plots - narrowly avoiding a sniper's bullet in Pennsylvania in July.\n\nAttention in the coming days will turn to the make-up of his cabinet, with senior advisers telling CBS that the Trump transition team are to meet at West Palm Beach in the coming days.\n\nAt his victory rally, Trump hinted that Robert F Kennedy Jr - a former Democrat and vaccine-sceptic - would be handed a key healthcare role.\n\n\"He's to help make America healthy again,\" Trump said. \"He wants to do some things, and we're going to let him go to it.\"\n\nBoth sides had armies of lawyers on standby for legal challenges on and after election day.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies nationwide were also on high alert for potential violence, but proceedings have been peaceful so far.\n\nAbout 30 hoax bomb threats targeted election-related locations nationwide on Tuesday, more than half of them in the state of Georgia alone, reports CBS.\n\nTrump's allies were quick to hail his victory on Wednesday morning, with Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley boasting that the result solidified the Republicans as \"Donald Trump's party\".\n\nFlorida Senator Marco Rubio, tipped as a potential pick for Trump's cabinet, wrote on X that \"hardworking Americans\" had triumphed over the \"celebrities\" who backed Kamala Harris.\n\nAnd former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo - tipped for a return to the role - said Trump would ensure a \"safe, secure and prosperous future\" for Americans.\n\nMeanwhile, Senator Lindsey Graham warned special prosecutor Jack Smith - who has pursued charges against Donald Trump for his role in the Capitol riot - that it was \"clear the American people are tired of lawfare\" and urged him to end his cases against the president-elect.\n\nThere has been little response so far from senior Democrats to the Trump victory.\n\nBut two Republican opponents of the president-elect - both former members of Congress - have spoken out.\n\nLiz Cheney urged all Americans to accept the results of the election.\n\n\"We now have a special responsibility, as citizens of the greatest nation on earth, to do everything we can to support and defend our Constitution, preserve the rule of law, and ensure that our institutions hold over these coming four years,\" she wrote on X.\n\nAdam Kinzinger said he was \"still in the trenches\" with those who opposed Trump.\n\n\"Everybody keep your heads up.  This isn't forever, and after America gets a taste of what it voted for, there will likely be a massive backlash,\" he said.\n\nAged just 10 when his father first became president, he's now well over six feet tall, and goes to New York University.\n\nThe US president spoke about his plans for the second Trump administration, as well as criticising the 'corrupt establishment'.\n\nWatch the historic moment when the 45th president is returned to power as he takes the oath of office.\n\nElon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos were among those invited inside the Capitol for Donald Trump's swearing in.\n\nThousands of people joined in on demonstrations as the United States prepares to inaugurate its new president.\n\nThe outgoing US president warned against power in the hands of the wealthy, the threat of the tech industry and climate change.\n\nTrump's pick for US attorney general was pressed on claims of election fraud and pardons for January 6 rioters.\n\nDonald Trump's defence secretary nominee was asked about his stance on women in combat and his alleged excessive drinking.\n\nHarris, who Trump defeated in the 2024 election, presided over the event as required by the US Constitution.\n\nAmong the allies the president-elect has chosen to join his administration are contentious figures, including among fellow Republicans.\n\nThe president-elect has nominated RFK to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe suspect used an \"improvised incendiary device\" to start the fire in Portland, Oregon, ahead of the US election.\n\nA week after losing the election, Kamala Harris's team are still appealing for funds.\n\nRepublicans have won control of both chambers of Congress, yielding Trump limited congressional oversight for at least 2 years.\n\nThe president and president-elect shook hands as part of a long-standing tradition signifying the transfer of power.\n\nGiven all the things they've said about each other, Joe Biden and Donald Trump's meeting could be really awkward.\n\n'I think Putin believes that he knows how to play Trump', says Trump's former adviser John Bolton.\n\nThe Russian president says he was impressed by Trump's reaction to the first assassination attempt against him.\n\nThe president addressed Americans from the White House for the first time since Donald Trump's election victory.\n\nAfter Donald Trump's decisive victory, we asked Americans what they think made the difference for each campaign.\n\nTasked with reducing government spending and cutting jobs, the agency has faced legal challenges.\n\nThe conspiracy theorist reportedly urged Trump to fire several National Security Council officials, a claim denied by the president.\n\nThe Vances met as students, when they joined a discussion group on \"social decline in white America\".\n\nIndian Americans are optimistic about India's future, but wary of US-India ties under a second Trump term.\n\nThe conservative from Ohio shot to fame writing about his hard upbringing and is now next in line to the US presidency.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "JD Vance: The 'hillbilly' Maga loyalist who became vice-president\n\nUS Vice-President JD Vance is no stranger to transformation.\n\nVance grew up in poverty, but went on to Yale Law School and rubbed shoulders with Silicon Valley elites before turning his life story into a politically tinged memoir which championed conservative values.\n\nHe is a former US Marine who served in Iraq as a military journalist before becoming a sharp critic of American involvement overseas.\n\nAnd having once said he was a \"never-Trump guy\", he took office as Trump's deputy - and a steadfast Maga (Make America Great Again) loyalist.\n\nHis current job also makes him the early frontrunner in the 2028 presidential race, when Trump will no longer be able to run under rules set out in the US Constitution.\n\nTrump, 78, is the oldest person ever to be sworn in as US president, and 40-year-old Vance is - as an old phrase goes - just a heartbeat away from the top job.\n\nBut now the former Ohio Senator and self-described \"hillbilly\" faces perhaps his biggest test - keeping in with Trump and forging a role in the administration when Elon Musk has sucked up much more attention than the president's elected second-in-command.\n\nThe pitfalls are obvious. The last Republican Vice-President, Mike Pence, dared to stand up to Trump by refusing to overturn the duo's 2020 election loss.\n\nPence's subsequent bid to run for president crashed and burned, and he is now persona non grata in the Maga world.\n\nVance will hope to avoid the same fate. And his recent lecturing of US allies - including a fiery confrontation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office - point to a possible role he may fill as vice-president, that of an aggressive champion of \"America first\" foreign policy.\n\nVance was born James Donald Bowman in Middletown, Ohio, to a mother who struggled with addiction and a father who left the family when JD was a toddler.\n\nHe was raised by his grandparents, \"Mamaw\" and \"Papaw\", whom he sympathetically portrayed in Hillbilly Elegy, published in 2016.\n\nA revolving cast of father figures - he changed his surname several times - and his mother's drug abuse issues resulted in a chaotic childhood, and he found refuge in Mamaw's house.\n\nWhen he married, both JD and his wife Usha took the last name of Vance to honour his maternal grandparents' family name - leading to his current name: James David Vance.\n\nMiddletown is located in rust-belt Ohio, but Vance identified closely with his extended family's roots to the south.\n\nAppalachia is a vast mountainous inland region that stretches from the Deep South to the fringes of the industrial Midwest and north-east. Largely but not exclusively white, it includes some of the country's poorest areas, where jobs are scarce and drugs and violence are abundant.\n\nIn Hillbilly Elegy, Vance painted a personal portrait of the trials, travails and bad decisions of family members, neighbours and friends. While criticising outsiders for looking down on the \"hillbillies\" of the book's title, he took a distinctly conservative view, describing his own people as chronic spendthrifts, dependent on government welfare payments and mostly failing to work hard and pull themselves up by their tattered bootstraps.\n\nHe wrote that he saw Appalachians \"reacting to bad circumstances in the worst way possible\" and that they were products of \"a culture that encourages social decay instead of counteracting it\".\n\n\"The truth is hard,\" he wrote, \"and the hardest truths for hill people are the ones they must tell about themselves.\"\n\nBy the time the book came out - with near-perfect timing in the thick of the 2016 presidential race - Vance's own bootstrap-tugging had slung him far away from Middletown. His stint in the US Marines including a tour of duty in Iraq was followed by college at Ohio State University and Yale Law School, then a job as a venture capitalist in California.\n\nHillbilly Elegy not only made him into a bestselling author, but a sought-after commentator who was frequently called upon to explain Donald Trump's appeal to white, working-class voters.\n\nHis verdict on Trump was damning - and definitive. Some quotes from the time:\n\n\"I'm a 'never Trump' guy. I never liked him.\"\n\n\"My god what an idiot.\"\n\n\"I find him reprehensible.\"\n\nAs he promoted his book, and along with it a mix of sympathy for the working class and conservative values, Vance rarely missed an opportunity to criticise the then-Republican nominee.\n\n\"I think this election is really having a negative effect especially on the white working class,\" he told an interviewer in October 2016.\n\n\"What it's doing is giving people an excuse to point the finger at someone else, point the finger at Mexican immigrants, or Chinese trade or the Democratic elites or whatever else.\"\n\nIronically, those are exactly some of the themes that he himself would go on to regularly raise eight years later, as Trump's running mate.\n\nVance and his wife Usha, who he met at Yale, have three children - Ewan, Vivek and Mirabel.\n\nUsha Vance had a posher upbringing than her husband, growing up in a suburb of San Diego as the child of Indian immigrant academics. In addition to her Yale history and law degrees, she has a master's from the UK's University of Cambridge.\n\nShe served as a clerk to Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and most recently worked for Munger, Tolles & Olson, a firm that a leading legal journal described as \"progressive\" and \"woke\". Mrs Vance resigned from her job shortly after her husband was selected by Trump to be the VP nominee.\n\nIn 2017, in the early years of the first Trump term, Vance and his family returned to Ohio after several years of living on the US coasts.\n\nAt the same time, whispers about Vance's possible foray into politics - bolstered by his newfound fame - grew. And several years later, Vance saw an opportunity when Ohio's Republican Senator Rob Portman decided not to run for re-election in 2022.\n\nAlthough his campaign was initially slow to get going, it got a kick-start via a $10m  (£7.7m) donation from his former boss, Silicon Valley powerbroker Peter Thiel.\n\nHis rhetoric shifted, and he spent less time talking about the failures of hillbillies and more about those of elites, the \"woke\" and Democrats. He began appearing on Fox News, but to drum up support, he also popped up on fringier political outlets - including the right-wing Newsmax network and niche podcasts and YouTube channels.\n\nMany of the controversial clips which would later resurface during the 2024 presidential campaign date from around the time his Senate campaign was starting to gain traction.\n\nAt one point he told then-Fox News host Tucker Carlson that the United States was being run by \"a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.\" Vance later called his remark \"dumb\" but said he was trying to make the point that \"our country has become almost pathologically anti-child\".\n\nHowever the real hurdle stopping him from getting elected to the Senate was his past criticism of Trump.\n\nVance remained a Trump sceptic as late as 2020, according to text messages obtained by the Washington Post. Then, he wrote that the president had \"thoroughly failed to deliver on his economic populism (excepting a disjointed China policy)\". And he correctly predicted that Trump would lose the presidency - although he would later endorse false claims that Trump actually beat Joe Biden.\n\nEventually, though, he found himself on a path back to Maga. During the 2022 Senate campaign, Vance apologised for his previous public criticism of Trump and earned an endorsement, pushing him to the top of the Republican field and eventually into the Senate.\n\nDuring his short tenure in the Senate, Vance was a reliable conservative vote, backing populist economic policies and emerging as one of the biggest congressional sceptics of aid to Ukraine - a role he would continue to play in the second Trump administration.\n\nDemocrats were in the majority during his time in Congress, muffling any impact that a freshman Republican senator might hope to have, however Vance proposed legislation to withhold federal funds from colleges that allow protests against Israel's war in Gaza or employ undocumented immigrants.\n\nAt a speech in July 2024 at the National Conservatism Conference, an increasingly influential gathering of right-wing and far-right leaders from around the world, he argued that American involvement in Ukraine had \"no obvious conclusion or even objective that we're close to getting accomplished\".\n\nAt the same conference, he said the UK was \"not doing so good\" because of immigration and claimed that under a Labour government, the country would become the \"first truly Islamist country\" with a nuclear bomb.\n\nJust days later, during the Republican National Convention, Trump tapped Vance for the VP nomination.\n\nHe received a rapturous welcome when he entered the venue in Milwaukee,  appearing slightly in awe as he was greeted by the party faithful.\n\nOnce out on the campaign trail, he established himself as an attack dog, relentlessly criticising the opposition and engaging with reporters in combative Q&A sessions at rallies and on cable TV shows.\n\nHe continued to attract controversy, spreading baseless rumours about Haitian immigrants eating pets, which caused huge upheaval in Springfield , a city not far from Vance's hometown in Ohio.\n\nDuring a CNN interview, Vance explained that he felt the need to \"create stories so that the... media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people\".\n\nHe insisted that constituents had told him stories of pet-eating by immigrants, even though he did not elaborate and his Senate office did not respond to the BBC's requests for details.\n\nHe also shifted his views on abortion policy. A Catholic convert, Vance had at one time expressed support for a nationwide abortion ban after 15 weeks of pregnancy. He later backed Trump's view that the matter should be left up to individual states to decide.\n\nDuring the whirlwind first weeks of Trump's second term, Vance gave staunch backing for his boss's plans to reshape and scale back government - and questioned the authority of US judges to stand in the way.\n\nBut Vance was often overshadowed by Trump's cost-cutting tsar Elon Musk and his attempts to take a wrecking ball to multiple government departments.\n\nThe vice-president has had more of an impact on foreign policy. He made his debut on the world stage with a trip to Europe, during which he berated US allies at the Munich Security Conference. Vance accused European leaders of censoring free speech, taking in too many immigrants and undermining democracy.\n\nThen in late February came the argument in the Oval Office, during a meeting that went off the rails after Vance interjected to praise Trump's diplomacy and slam the previous Democratic administration.\n\nZelensky replied by outlining the recent decade including repeated Russian violations of ceasefire agreements and pointedly asked the vice-president: \"What kind of diplomacy, JD, [are] you are speaking about?\"\n\nThe conversation devolved from there, with Vance accusing Zelensky of disrespect.\n\n\"Have you said thank you once?\" Vance demanded, as the Ukrainian president pointed out that he had thanked Americans on numerous occasions.\n\nIt was a return to Vance's loyal attack-dog style seen on the campaign trail.\n\nAs for the future, Trump was asked in a February interview broadcast before the Super Bowl if he viewed Vance as his successor.\n\n\"No,\" Trump said, before explaining that at this stage, the Republican 2028 field is still wide open. \"But he's very capable... it's too early, we're just starting.\"\n\nThe reward for Vance's loyalty could be huge. But the vice-presidency is no sure ticket to the top job. Just ask Kamala Harris - or Mike Pence.\n\nAged just 10 when his father first became president, he's now well over six feet tall, and goes to New York University.\n\nThe US president spoke about his plans for the second Trump administration, as well as criticising the 'corrupt establishment'.\n\nWatch the historic moment when the 45th president is returned to power as he takes the oath of office.\n\nElon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos were among those invited inside the Capitol for Donald Trump's swearing in.\n\nThousands of people joined in on demonstrations as the United States prepares to inaugurate its new president.\n\nThe outgoing US president warned against power in the hands of the wealthy, the threat of the tech industry and climate change.\n\nTrump's pick for US attorney general was pressed on claims of election fraud and pardons for January 6 rioters.\n\nDonald Trump's defence secretary nominee was asked about his stance on women in combat and his alleged excessive drinking.\n\nHarris, who Trump defeated in the 2024 election, presided over the event as required by the US Constitution.\n\nAmong the allies the president-elect has chosen to join his administration are contentious figures, including among fellow Republicans.\n\nThe president-elect has nominated RFK to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe suspect used an \"improvised incendiary device\" to start the fire in Portland, Oregon, ahead of the US election.\n\nA week after losing the election, Kamala Harris's team are still appealing for funds.\n\nRepublicans have won control of both chambers of Congress, yielding Trump limited congressional oversight for at least 2 years.\n\nThe president and president-elect shook hands as part of a long-standing tradition signifying the transfer of power.\n\nGiven all the things they've said about each other, Joe Biden and Donald Trump's meeting could be really awkward.\n\n'I think Putin believes that he knows how to play Trump', says Trump's former adviser John Bolton.\n\nThe Russian president says he was impressed by Trump's reaction to the first assassination attempt against him.\n\nThe president addressed Americans from the White House for the first time since Donald Trump's election victory.\n\nAfter Donald Trump's decisive victory, we asked Americans what they think made the difference for each campaign.\n\nTasked with reducing government spending and cutting jobs, the agency has faced legal challenges.\n\nThe conspiracy theorist reportedly urged Trump to fire several National Security Council officials, a claim denied by the president.\n\nThe Vances met as students, when they joined a discussion group on \"social decline in white America\".\n\nIndian Americans are optimistic about India's future, but wary of US-India ties under a second Trump term.\n\nTrump's inner circle includes the world's richest man, a former NFL player, and a Wall Street financer.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

The rest of the world is laughing at our once-respected nation, he tells voters, and only a change in leadership will restore America to the prosperous superpower it once was. On a recent bus tour in Iowa, the former vice president tells audiences what a shame it is that parents have to turn down the volume when the president appears on TV, for fear of their children hearing something nasty or inappropriate. A grandfather who uses words like \"malarkey,\" he jokingly apologizes that one side of the room has to look at his bald spot while he speaks.\n\nRemember when? Nostalgia often is a feature of ads, not political campaigns, which usually focus on the future. But Joe Biden, like President Donald Trump, tends to hark back to a \"better time.\"\n\nTypically, political campaigns, especially presidential ones, focus on the future. Candidates offer fresh visions for the country, detailing innovative plans that would usher in a new, modern era of peace and prosperity.\n\nBut if Mr. Biden, who served in the Senate for more than three decades, wins the Democratic nomination, then the general election next year will feature two septuagenarians who spend a great deal of time talking about the past.\n\n\"Advertisers have been using nostalgia for decades,\" says David Pizarro, a psychology professor at Cornell University. The Biden and Trump campaigns \"are taking a page from a strategy that has worked well for, say, Coca-Cola.\"\n\nAnd while it may be less common in politics than themes like hope or change, Mr. Pizarro says it makes sense that campaigns today would employ nostalgia as a tool. Because despite \"tons of things being way better than they ever have been\" - such as longer life expectancies and improvements in education, for example - most people believe the country is worse off now than in the past.\n\n\"Part of the reason is that it's easier now than ever to see all the bad things,\" says Mr. Pizarro. \"And because of that, it can really seem like things are getting worse and worse.\"\n\nOne difference between Mr. Biden's and Mr. Trump's use of nostalgia, says Mr. Pizarro, is the time period of their idyllic years. Mr. Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" can mean different things to different people, but it clearly harks back to a time well before the Obama years. By contrast, Mr. Biden is wrapping himself in the Obama presidency - hoping to benefit from the warm feelings many Democrats hold for the former president, and the desire of many voters to return to the relative \"normalcy\" of that era.\n\nIn Ames, Iowa, for example, a woman asks him about improving Amtrak, but before she sits down, she tells the former vice president: \"I back you because you worked well with Obama.\"\n\nThe same goes for Wartburg College students Makayla and Sidney in Waverly. \"For me, it was his connection with the Obama campaign,\" says Makayla, explaining why she decided to come hear Mr. Biden speak.\n\nTo be sure, Mr. Biden is also careful to cast his vision forward. When a voter at Iowa State asks him how he plans to repair the damage from President Trump's first term, he responds: \"I'm not going to just repair. I want to build on what Barack and I built.\" At a community college in Iowa Falls, he says he is \"more optimistic than I've ever been\" about the future of America.\n\n\"As Vice President Biden said, he's running not to take us back to a fondly remembered past, but to build on our accomplishments,\" says Bill Russo, the campaign's deputy communications director. That includes beefing up Obamacare by adding a Medicare-like public option, reentering the Paris climate agreement while looking to \"up the ante\" on climate change, and reauthorizing and updating the Violence Against Women Act to include modern problems like online harassment, Mr. Russo says.\n\nStill, the former vice president frequently evokes the past - particularly when speaking about America's image abroad.\n\nMr. Biden's \"No Malarkey!\" tour in Iowa coincided with the NATO summit in London where foreign leaders, including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, French President Emmanuel Macron, and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson were caught on tape appearing to mock President Trump. At first, Mr. Biden said he would wait to comment because of his personal policy of not criticizing presidents while on foreign soil. But by the end of the day, he was referencing the tape directly and his campaign had released an ad saying four more years of President Trump would make it difficult to ever \"recover America's standing.\"\n\nSubstantively, it makes sense that Mr. Biden would focus both on mending international relationships (he has more foreign policy experience than any of the other Democrats running), and restoring elements of the Obama era (he was there in the White House, after all).\n\nIt also makes sense stylistically, says Travis Ridout, co-founder of the Wesleyan Media Project, which tracks political advertising. One of Hillary Clinton's problems in 2016, he says, was that voters seemed to want change after eight years of the Obama administration. Mrs. Clinton tried to sell herself as a change candidate, but the message didn't really fit, since she was a longtime establishment figure who had served in the Obama administration. Mr. Biden would likely have similar difficulties if he tried to market himself that way.\n\n\"An 'I'm the change we need' message is just not going to work coming from Joe Biden,\" says Mr. Ridout. \"Authenticity is important in politics.\"\n\nRecently, Politico reported that Mr. Biden has been signaling to close allies that, if elected, he would likely serve only one term. The Biden campaign quickly issued a denial, saying Mr. Biden would not make a one-term pledge and that it is not something the former vice president is thinking about.\n\nBut Mr. Biden's age - he would be 82 years old at the end of his first term - may be his biggest liability as a candidate. And in some ways, he has been presenting himself as a kind of transition figure - a trusted, steady hand who can help stabilize the government after the chaos of the Trump years, while the nation figures out what it wants going forward.\n\nThat sense of familiarity may help explain why Mr. Biden has continued to hover at the top of national polls and in the top tier in Iowa and New Hampshire surveys, despite lackluster fundraising and smaller crowds than some of his rivals. Indeed, while other candidates have shot to the top of the pack at different times only to fall back again, Mr. Biden has shown steady resilience.\n\nThe most recent Iowa poll, from Emerson College, shows Mr. Biden back in the lead in the Hawkeye State, after a spate of November surveys showing Pete Buttigieg, the fresh-faced mayor of South Bend, Indiana, on top.\n\nMore than a dozen voters across four town halls say they are torn between Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg. At a Biden event in Iowa Falls, one woman says she is leaning toward Mr. Buttigieg because the country might need a younger president. Another says she is leaning toward Mr. Biden because of his experience, but would like to see Mr. Buttigieg as his vice president.\n\n\"I would vote for [Biden] in a minute if he gets the nomination,\" says Kurt Kelsey after hearing Mr. Biden speak in Iowa Falls. Still, he and his wife, Arlisse, who farm corn, soybeans, and hay, say they're leaning toward some of the other Democratic candidates. Mr. Kelsey likes New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and Mayor Pete, and Mrs. Kelsey says she likes Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

By 8 a.m., when he joined legions of other supporters of incoming President Donald Trump waiting to get into a preinauguration afternoon rally, the line already stretched several blocks deep - and kept growing.\n\nMr. Pellegrino, who installs home swimming pools, had attended Trump rallies before, so he knew he'd be among friends. Back home, he hasn't always felt welcome to express his views. But lately, he says, the mood has changed even in Democratic-run New Jersey.\n\n\"You can go out and wear a MAGA hat. It's OK to support Trump,\" he says.\n\nDonald Trump and his MAGA movement are in power once more - and this time, the outsiders are looking more like insiders, at the vanguard of a cultural and political shift that could be profound.\n\nWhen Mr. Trump rode into Washington in 2017, the reception he received was as frosty as the outdoor temperatures on Inauguration Day. Four years later, in 2021, he left the White House under a cloud after Trump loyalists stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, in a failed effort to stall or overturn his election defeat. Mr. Trump headed into what seemed like permanent exile at his Mar-a-Lago redoubt in Florida.\n\nBut now, the incoming president and his MAGA (\"Make America Great Again\") movement are triumphant once more - and this time, they're hardly the wild-eyed rebels taking over a hostile fortress. The outsiders are looking more like insiders, the vanguard of a cultural and political shift that could be far more profound than in his first presidency. Mr. Trump has remade the Republican Party, once stuffed with lawmakers and power brokers who looked down on him, in his image. He's also racked up support from wealthy entrepreneurs ready to shed inhibitions about his abrasive brand of politics.\n\nIt's a far cry from the candidate who was seen as a political outlier and \"a bit of an accidental president\" after an upset win in 2016, says Susan Stokes, director of the Chicago Center on Democracy at the University of Chicago. \"He has more legitimacy this time around ... and he's a more powerful and confident political actor.\"\n\nBehind the personal vindication and vibe shift is electoral math: Mr. Trump won the popular vote in 2024, unlike in the past two elections (albeit by just 1.5 percentage points). He also won every battleground state, defeating Vice President Kamala Harris, who had outraised him. Most analysts had predicted tight margins in swing states and underestimated Mr. Trump's ability to turn out irregular voters .\n\nSunday's victory rally was part of a packed schedule of celebrations and ceremonies for Mr. Trump, who will be sworn into office at noon Monday at an indoor inauguration ceremony at the Capitol amid frigid temperatures. Hundreds of thousands of supporters who received tickets to attend an outdoor ceremony will instead have to try to get into the 20,000-seat Capital One Arena to watch live coverage. After taking the presidential oath of office, Mr. Trump is scheduled to join them at the arena for a scaled-down parade.\n\nOn Saturday, thousands of people marched near the Capitol to protest against Mr. Trump and his policies on issues such as climate change, transgender rights, and race relations. But it was a modest show of defiance compared with 2017, when millions of women marched here and in cities across the country as part of a resistance movement on the political left.\n\nKelly Hall remembers the protests that year and the hostility shown toward Mr. Trump and supporters like her. A retired airwoman and emergency room nurse from Boonville, New York, she brought her husband to the inauguration this time - \"He really loves Trump\" - and sounded upbeat Sunday, even as rain, snow, and hail pelted the lines of people inching toward the rally venue.\n\n\"People are starting to come together more,\" she says, looking across the crowds still waiting to enter, even after the rally had begun. \"I think we're the majority now.\"\n\nSome supporters were still outside when Mr. Trump took the stage around 5 p.m. to deliver a speech in his freewheeling style, making promises and jokes, mixing facts and falsehoods on issues like crime and immigration. He boasted about assembling an \"all-star\" Cabinet and praised his family. He also hinted strongly that he would pardon supporters convicted of crimes related to the 2021 attack on the Capitol, among other executive actions in his first few days.\n\n\"Starting tomorrow, I will act with historic speed and strength, and fix every single crisis facing our country,\" he said.\n\nElon Musk, Mr. Trump's billionaire backer, briefly appeared with his young son, who danced onstage behind him. The incoming president has tapped Mr. Musk to run an advisory commission on government efficiency and reportedly given him office space at the White House.\n\nMr. Musk is among a clutch of ultrawealthy men in the tech industry who have backed Mr. Trump and helped fund his inauguration, including sponsoring balls and private dinners. Major corporations have also ponied up , including some that kept their distance in the past. Cryptocurrency investors hoping for light-touch federal regulations have proved particularly generous in their donations .\n\nThe stampede of tycoons visiting Mr. Trump at Mar-a-Lago since the election has drawn sharp criticism from many on the left. New Yorker Editor David Remnick described it as \"a scene of such flagrant self-abnegation, ring-kissing, and genuflection that it would embarrass a medieval Pope.\"\n\nAmong Mr. Trump's more ordinary supporters waiting for the rally Sunday, some voiced concerns about the wealthy businessmen courting him and the favors they seek. Ms. Hall says she's been unhappy to see \"two-faced\" chief executives who had previously scorned Mr. Trump showing up at his side. A war of words recently erupted among Trump allies over a skilled-worker visa program popular with tech executives that anti-immigration hawks want to end.\n\nBut to the MAGA faithful, any suggestion that Mr. Trump would go back on his campaign promises in return for corporate largesse is anathema. He's not for sale, they insist.\n\n\"He doesn't need the money. He can't really be bought,\" says Tom Slack, an industrial painter from Brandon, Minnesota, who brought his wife and three children to the inauguration.\n\nWhile business elites may want to co-opt Mr. Trump, supporters say, that's not who he is. \"He's not part of the establishment. That's why he's special,\" says Charlene Farmer, a retiree from Waynesboro, Pennsylvania, as she tugged her red poncho over her head to keep off volleys of icy rain.\n\nAnalysts say corporate leaders are seeking closer relations with Mr. Trump and his movement because it's good for business: He's ascendant, and much of the stigma has dissipated . Some are revising company policies, ending diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and, on Wall Street, reversing pledges to reduce investments in industries that contribute most to climate change. Taken together, it adds up to a shift away from progressive ideals and the regulatory approach of President Joe Biden.\n\nWith the exception of Mr. Musk and a handful of right-leaning tech investors, most major business leaders preferred Ms. Harris to Mr. Trump and didn't donate to his campaign .\n\nBut now that he's taking power, it's not surprising that they're climbing on board, says Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor of leadership at the Yale School of Management. \"All the [previously] skeptical CEOs are willing to meet with him ... because they want him to succeed. They want America to succeed,\" he says.\n\nProfessor Sonnenfeld is skeptical of the notion that corporations are \"adopting MAGA social policies\" to placate Mr. Trump, noting that the rollback of DEI and other initiatives was already happening under Mr. Biden, as companies looked for efficiencies. \"People are just noticing in January 2025 what was already taking place in January 2022,\" he says.\n\nWhile the amount of money pouring into inauguration celebrations has set records, Mr. Trump wasn't exactly hurting for cash last time. In 2017, he raised over $100 million , including from investors and executives who hadn't supported his candidacy.\n\nStill, there were fewer champagne balls and black-tie parties that year. A more emblematic event was a \"DeploraBall\" held at the National Press Club with around 1,000 supporters, including Proud Boys and far-right activists and online provocateurs, some of whom are now household names in MAGA media. The ball's name was a reference to Trump opponent Hillary Clinton's labeling some of his followers as deplorable.\n\nSunday's Trump rally, which featured singers and entertainers, spliced with the bombastic messaging of a campaign event, is not without precedent. In 2009, President Barack Obama held a concert on the National Mall for more than 400,000 people the day before his inauguration. Bruce Springsteen and Garth Brooks were among the A-list stars onstage.\n\nFor Mr. Trump, the adulation and celebration on display at mass rallies has been a constant theme of his political career, and a defining feature of the MAGA movement. Even as president, he kept wanting to get back onstage.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

It reiterates many of Mr. Trump's campaign promises -  including building an Iron Dome missile defense system over the United States, and implementing \"THE LARGEST DEPORTATION OPERATION IN AMERICAN HISTORY.\" It also promises to hold government officials accountable for alleged abuses of power, such as \"illegal censoring\" of lawful speech or \"unjustly\" prosecuting political opponents.\n\nA party platform, while not binding, gives an indication of policy priorities and a road map for governing. The changes since 2016 reflect a populist shift, dialing back long-standing Republican stances on abortion, guns, and fiscal responsibility.\n\nDelegates to the Republican National Convention, which kicks off Monday in Milwaukee, are expected to adopt the new platform and formally choose Mr. Trump as the GOP presidential nominee.\n\nA party platform is a document that outlines what a political party believes on key issues - essentially a party's \"mission statement.\" It is typically written by major party figures as well as representatives from interest groups.\n\nRussell Vought, who headed up the Office of Management and Budget during the Trump administration, is the policy director for the Republican National Committee platform committee. Mr. Vought is also one of the authors of Project 2025 , a sweeping presidential transition plan created by the Heritage Foundation that offers a road map for an incoming conservative administration, although Mr. Trump has recently sought to distance himself from it.\n\nParty platforms have been a regular feature of campaigns since 1840, when then-President Martin Van Buren outlined nine major Democratic Party positions in about 500 words. Modern-day platforms are far more complex, running up to 75 pages long. They include a preamble that lays out how the party sees the state of the country and the problems that must be addressed, as well as goals it seeks to achieve on different issues.\n\nTypically, both parties draft updated platforms during presidential election years, and delegates vote to adopt the platform at their nominating convention. Presidential candidates are not bound to follow it. However, a platform is usually a good indicator of how a party hopes to govern.\n\nSince 2016 the Republican Party has been moving away from its Ronald Reagan-era conservative roots, reshaping itself along the lines of Mr. Trump's \"America First\" populism. The new platform shows just how deep an imprint he has made, from shifting policy priorities to adopting his signature and unusual use of capitalization.\n\nThe 2016 platform - which was used again in 2020 - more closely resembled the GOP's traditional conservative vision. This year's platform is significantly shorter - 16 pages, compared with 66 - and dedicated to \"the Forgotten Men and Women of America.\" It appears to be aimed at regular voters, not policy wonks.\n\nIn many ways, the platform reads more as an extension of Mr. Trump's campaign than as a detailed description of party policy priorities. The preamble begins, \"America First.\" Mr. Trump is referenced by name 19 times.\n\nBy contrast, Mr. Trump was not referenced at all in the 2016 platform. And he was mentioned just three times in a 2020 resolution to forgo developing a new platform that year, though it pledged to \"enthusiastically support the President's America-first agenda.\"\n\nThis year's platform dedicates a section to culture war issues like \"gender ideology\" and critical race theory. Other issues it prioritizes include election security and energy production. It puts the most focus on border security, promising to place the U.S. military on the southern border and to enact stricter vetting processes and \"keep foreign Christian-hating Communists, Marxists, and Socialists out of America.\"\n\nThat's a sharp difference in tone from the 2016 platform, which also called for improved border security, but sought to strike an inclusive note. \"Our party is the natural home for those who come in search of freedom and justice,\" began the section on immigration.  \"We welcome all to the Great Opportunity Party.\"\n\nOne long-standing campaign issue for Republicans is almost entirely absent from this year's platform: fortifying Second Amendment rights.\n\nWhile the 2016 platform dedicated a three-paragraph section, and included references elsewhere to Second Amendment protections, the 2024 platform has only a passing promise to defend \"THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS.\"\n\nAnd for the first time in four decades, the Republican platform doesn't include a call for a national abortion ban. It commends the Supreme Court ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 for giving the power to ban abortion \"to the States.\" But the word \"abortion\" appears only one time, compared with 35 times in the 2016 platform. The document also affirms support for access to birth control and in vitro fertilization (IVF), the latter of which was recently formally opposed by the Southern Baptist Convention.\n\nParts of the platform have drawn criticism from evangelical Christians, including Mr. Trump's former vice president, Mike Pence, who called the change in abortion policy \"a profound disappointment.\"\n\nIn addition, the GOP's long-held priorities of reducing entitlement spending and reining in the national debt aren't discussed. The word \"debt\" doesn't appear anywhere in the document, and \"deficit\" appears only once, in reference to the trade deficit. There is, however, a promise to \"immediately stabilize the Economy by slashing wasteful Government spending and promoting Economic Growth.\"\n\nMeanwhile, several sections address \"Gender Insanity,\" \"Gender Indoctrination,\" and \"GENDER IDEOLOGY.\" The word \"gender\" did not appear once in 2016.\n\nReferences to foreign policy are mostly broad, such as promising that \"Republicans will end the global chaos and restore Peace\" and counter China. Russia and Ukraine are not named. The 2016 platform, by contrast, dedicated pages to specific and nuanced foreign policy positions.\n\nMarjorie Hershey, a political science professor at Indiana University, calls the 2024 GOP platform \"a series of outtakes from Trump's rally speeches.\"\n\nNot all Republicans are happy with the changes. But the RNC's support for Mr. Trump's policies seems to signal that the party has indeed gotten on board. Many members who were once strong critics have urged the party to coalesce behind him.\n\n\"Trump has completely taken control of the party,\" says Dr. Hershey.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

A former Australian prime minister said the prospect of his presidency made him \"tremble.\" Piñatas in his image, complete with his signature coif, have become all the rage in Mexico.\n\nThe unorthodox march of Donald Trump toward the Republican nomination has transfixed audiences from London to Latin America. The world has looked on with confusion, consternation, and a few congratulations at the prospect that a brash billionaire with no political experience, who says whatever he wants, could possibly find his way to the White House.\n\nAny US presidential race is hot-ticket international news. But this one comes at a time of deep global insecurity. Mr. Trump's status as an unknown quantity feeds nations' worries about everything from the continuation of their trade deals to military ties.\n\nYet the rise of Trump is also seen in many corners as a gauge of Americans' concerns about their diminishing role on the world stage. In Europe, this is something of a familiar phenomenon as populists gain at the polls, fueled by frustration over migration, globalization, and social change.\n\nIf there is an optimistic side, it lies in the hope of many that, whether he wins or not, Trump's candidacy will have jostled political elites and forced them to address the gap between a widespread sense of malaise and the simplistic, often outrageous solutions of straight-talking populists.\n\n\"It is quite clear that people are not happy with the establishment, and they are so unhappy that they are willing to overlook some pretty serious xenophobia,\" says Christine Harlen, who teaches US politics and international political economy at the University of Leeds in England. \"Maybe it could be a wake-up call that something has to change.\"\n\nLike that of other populists gaining footholds around the world, Trump's rise is seen as first and foremost a protest.\n\nWhile Trump's plans to build a wall along the US-Mexican border and make Mexico pay for it, or temporarily bar Muslims from visiting the United States - which prompted the extraordinary debate in Britain's Parliament - have attracted a fair share of racist voters, his appeal ripples wider. His supporters like his style as the anti-politician: muscular and even vulgar in speech, deriding the political dysfunction in Washington that has allowed everyday problems to mount.\n\nAs Zhu Feng, an analyst of South China Sea issues at China's Nanjing University, puts it: \"He is a real American. I do not see Trump as below the standards of American politics. He is a new face and a new force, and he carries a lot of the real hopes of American people.\"\n\nThe desire for change is apparent to US neighbors north and south, from the industrial hubs in Canada to the towns along the US-Mexican border. \"Americans are overall just angry in a lot of ways,\" says Brian Hogan, who works in Windsor, Ontario, across the river from Detroit. \"There's a lot of rancor in that country.\"\n\nMr. Hogan says his American friends feel unstable in their jobs and shaken by racially charged violence and gun crime.\n\n\"When people have personal challenges they look for answers,\" says Hogan, who leads a local teachers union. \"If someone is a racist but he's going to get you a job, you'd be interested.\"\n\nBut this is more than just a story of disillusioned individuals. To America's allies, Trump's appeal is also an expression of a nation that can't find its way amid new geopolitical currents, from the rise of China to that of the so-called Islamic State to the country's own isolationist mood.\n\nClive Hamilton, a professor of public ethics at Charles Sturt University in Canberra, Australia, says a substantial number of Americans are accommodating the US's changing place in the world instead of resisting it. But others are angry and resentful about America's inability to sway the Syria conflict, for example, or what they see as disruptive changes at home, such as the legalization of gay marriage, and a conviction that they aren't making headway in a system skewed against them.\n\nTrump's backers, Mr. Hamilton says, feel vulnerable to invasion: \"I'm not talking of military invasion. I'm talking of invasion by economic powers, by financial powers, by immigrants coming up from the south and across the seas - a generalized sense of insecurity that's taken root in the American populace, which is at the heart of the Trump phenomenon.\"\n\nIn Asia, this can seem like déjà vu. In Tokyo, Trump's angry words toward Japan have revived memories of the 1980s trade tensions with the US, provoking puzzlement among those who have witnessed Japan's struggle with economic stagnation and being overtaken by China in the intervening decades.\n\nTrump has also questioned the validity of the US-Japan security alliance, the bedrock of relations between the two countries since World War II. He accuses Tokyo of not paying enough for the protection it receives from the US. \"If Japan gets attacked, we have to immediately go to their aid,... if we get attacked, Japan doesn't have to help us. That's a fair deal?\" Trump asked at a rally in Iowa last August.\n\nMany in the world understand his rise through their own country's political experiences. That includes similar public figures who have made headlines, from former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to businessman Kevin O'Leary in Canada to former Osaka Mayor Toru Hashimoto in Japan. But it also touches on populism and a desire for a strong, independent - and rich - leader. This has been a feature of public life in Latin America for decades.\n\n\"Urbanization, industrialization brought modernization that challenged traditional norms, and that made people feel scared about their position in society,\" says Christopher Sabatini, an associate professor at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs in New York. In the Latin American context, independently wealthy leaders always get a second look from voters who feel they'll be less prone to corruption by businesses or drug traffickers.\n\nIn today's world, insecurity is fueling what might be described as the global appeal of the \"strongman.\" Motti Chaimovitz, a Tel Aviv cafe owner, says he has to look no further than home to understand Trump's gains: It's like the dynamic that swept Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu into office.\n\n\"There is a prevailing fear in the Western world. People are looking for strong candidates,\" he says. \"Those that put [Turkish President Recep Tayyip] Erdoğan and Netanyahu in power are the religious and rural vote.\"\n\nPerhaps the most apt comparisons today, however, come from Europe, where populists are gaining from France to Finland - putting some European leaders on the defensive. European-American relations were strained under former President George W. Bush, but the prospect of a Trump presidency has been viewed with a degree of panic.\n\nGermany's influential weekly magazine Der Spiegel wrote in a Jan. 2 headline that \"Donald Trump Is the World's Most Dangerous Man,\" and elaborated in the subhead. \"George W. Bush's America,\" it reads, \"would seem like a place of logic and reason in comparison.\" And The Economist Intelligence Unit ranked a Trump presidency as one of the top 10 risks facing the world, on a par with jihadi terrorism and more threatening than a military conflict in the South China Sea.\n\nThe mainstream parties have been faulted for underestimating the appeal of populism. Steven Ekovich, a professor of comparative politics at The American University of Paris, says they continue to denigrate populist supporters instead of looking in the mirror.\n\n\"One similarity between the US and France is the French elite have been disdainful and mocking of anyone supporting Marine Le Pen,\" he says. \"They are essentially verbally spitting on them, which has only reinforced Marine Le Pen's support.\"\n\nSome of Europe's populists have publicly supported Trump. Russian President Vladimir Putin has called him \"brilliant\" - after Trump said he believes he could get along with the Russian leader. From Moscow's vantage point, such leaders taking hold of Western public imagination is no surprise.\n\n\"I think Trump is the product of the same kind of ferment we see happening in Europe. People are disillusioned with the status quo and the standard answers issued by old-line politicians, and they want change,\" says Andrei Klimov a member of the Federation Council, Russia's upper house of parliament. \"He obviously appeals to a lot of people out there, who maybe say, 'I don't know where Ukraine is. I don't understand what we're doing in Syria. I don't want to feed refugees. Why can't we just look after our own?' \"\n\nWhile many voters may identify with this sentiment analysts warn that the promises of populism are too simplistic.\n\nMark Triffitt, a lecturer in public policy at the University of Melbourne in Australia, argues that the insecurity people feel \"lends itself to a mind-set that America should retreat and go back to a world which is very difficult to reconstruct, one that is built around a dominant manufacturing sector, one centered on an unambiguous sense of American power.\"\n\nNo one is predicting the shape that US foreign policy would take under Trump - mostly because he is unpredictable, either not detailing his positions or changing them rapidly. But many are already worried.\n\nIranians, for example, are eager to know if the landmark nuclear deal painstakingly negotiated for years and finally agreed to last July between Iran and six world powers will be \"torn up,\" as some Republican candidates have promised.\n\nKayhan Barzegar, director of the Institute for Middle East Strategic Studies in Tehran, Iran, says Trump could endanger US interests \"considering the reality that US power ... requires engaging others [in] solving the world's common problems.\"\n\nDaniel Friedrich, a teacher in Berlin, has faith that if Trump is elected the American democracy would restrict him so that the world order would remain much as it is now.\n\n\"In the end, no matter who the president is, the president is constrained in all kinds of ways by other institutional factors,\" he says, \"so I think that the effect might not be as bad as one might think at first sight, just as the effect of [President] Obama was not as good as one might have hoped for.\"\n\nBut Josefina Ponce, a waitress and college student of psychology in Mexico City, says Trump is changing her view of the US.\n\n\"I have gone from feeling 'he doesn't represent all Americans' to feeling like 'maybe I don't understand the US like I thought [I did],' \" she says.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

He goes so far as to say a Trump victory would be \"a big blow to the unity of the Western world.\n\n\"In comparison to other world powers, this has always been the US's biggest strength: keeping like-minded countries together with a very soft approach, linking them one to the other.

He has made clear he sees himself as a persecuted figure who has been victorious over his tormentors.\n\nBut in his return to the national stage, his political grievances have also taken on a personal note. Mr. Trump has made clear he sees himself as a persecuted figure - and painted his return to office as a victory over his tormentors.\n\n\"Over the past eight years, I have been tested and challenged more than any president in our 250-year history, and I've learned a lot along the way. The journey to reclaim our republic has not been an easy one, that I can tell you. Those who wish to stop our cause have tried to take my freedom, and indeed, to take my life,\" Mr. Trump said. After discussing the attempt on his life in July, he declared: \"I was saved by God to make America great again.\"\n\nHe pledged to depoliticize the Justice Department, which in his view was turned against him under the Biden administration.\n\n\"The scales of justice will be rebalanced. The vicious, violent, and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department and our government will end,\" he said.\n\nNot everyone has confidence in Mr. Trump's pledge to depoliticize the department. Just before leaving office on Monday, President Joe Biden issued preemptive pardons for numerous elected and appointed government officials viewed as enemies by Mr. Trump - and against whom the newly returned president had hinted about seeking vengeance. He also offered preemptive pardons to a number of his own family members.\n\nBecause of chilly temperatures, Mr. Trump's second inauguration took place in the rotunda of the U.S. Capitol - the first time in 40 years a swearing-in had been moved inside. Washington hit a high of 27 degrees Fahrenheit on Monday; for President Barack Obama's first inauguration in 2008, which was held outside, the high temperature was 28 degrees. The last time an inauguration was moved indoors due to weather was for Ronald Reagan's second inauguration, when highs reached just 7 degrees.\n\nIn his speech, Mr. Trump blasted \"a radical and corrupt establishment\" that he said \"has extracted power and wealth from our citizens while the pillars of our society lay broken and seemingly in complete disrepair.\"\n\nMr. Trump said he will act on behalf of everyone from consumers and auto workers (pledging to remove electric vehicle incentives and let people buy the cars they want) to people who want what he called a \"color-blind\" society, rather than one where elites are \"trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life.\"\n\nEven as Mr. Trump conveyed a populist message, many of the world's wealthiest people made a point to attend his inauguration this time around, with most of them cutting massive checks to the Trump inaugural committee, after staying far away eight years ago.\n\nTech billionaires, including Tesla head and Trump campaign mega-donor Elon Musk, Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon founder (and Washington Post owner) Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook, and Google CEO Sundar Pichai were seated near the dais - just behind Mr. Trump's family, and in front of Mr. Trump's Cabinet picks.\n\nMr. Trump enters office for the second time having been handed a relatively strong economy. The national unemployment rate is currently much lower than historic averages, and the stock market is booming. But inflation continues to be a challenge, even as the rate of inflation has eased over the past year - a major reason why he won a second term in office.\n\nMr. Trump's second inaugural address took place in the very room which Mr. Trump's supporters overran after warring with U.S. Capitol Police four years ago. Mr. Trump didn't attend President Joe Biden's inauguration a few weeks later, and he never stopped insisting, despite mountains of evidence to the contrary, that the 2020 election had been stolen from him. He faced a bevy of legal threats in the years following. But while he was convicted of felonies relating to covering up an alleged affair with a porn star before the 2016 election, the two criminal cases against him for his actions leading up to the Jan. 6, 2021, riot never made it to trial, nor did a fourth case involving his allegedly willful mishandling of classified documents. His return to office marks a stunning political comeback, and makes him the first convicted felon to assume the presidency.\n\nMr. Trump stuck to his prepared remarks for the speech, but he didn't stay in teleprompter mode for long. The newly sworn-in president immediately headed downstairs to the Capitol Visitor Center to address other supporters and lawmakers who hadn't been able to squeeze into the rotunda, delivering 30 minutes of off-the-cuff remarks that shed more light on his thinking.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\nHe grumbled about Mr. Biden's last-minute pardons. He returned to one of his favorite subjects from the campaign trail, complaining that 2020 was a \"rigged election,\" and alleging \"they tried\" to rig it again in 2024. He said he was persuaded not to talk in his inaugural address about the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, but suggested quick action on pardoning Jan. 6 defendants. \"It's action not words that count. And you know you'll see a lot of action on the J6 hostages,\" Mr. Trump declared.\n\n\"I think this is a better speech than the one I made upstairs,\" Mr. Trump commented as he concluded.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

We have accomplished more in 43 days than most administrations accomplish in four years or eight years - and we are just getting started,\" Mr. Trump declared in his first joint address to Congress since returning to the White House.\n\nThe speech comes amid a wild sprint in American history. Mr. Trump has deputized billionaire Elon Musk to slash the federal government , laying off thousands of workers in unpredictable spurts. Mr. Trump and Vice President JD Vance upbraided the president of Ukraine in the Oval Office last Friday, then cut off military aid to the U.S. ally. And the stock market has just gone through a two-day selloff triggered by the president's decision to levy heavy tariffs on Canada and Mexico, the U.S.'s top trading partners.\n\nIn his first speech to Congress since retaking office, President Donald Trump touted his accomplishments on the border and going after waste in government. On the economy, he cautioned that there might be 'a little disturbance.'\n\nPresidential joint addresses and State of the Union speeches are often dull laundry lists of policy proposals. This was lighter on that front than normal - even compared to Mr. Trump's previous addresses - and more focused on political score-settling. The president brought in guests to highlight political wedge issues, from immigration and crime to transgender women in sports.\n\nThe speech itself isn't likely to have a lasting legacy. What matters more for Mr. Trump's political future is the issue that handed him the election - inflation. If his tariffs, massive government layoffs, proposed tax plans, and other actions help boost the economy, his approval rating will likely hold steady or rise, and he'll have more leeway for his other policies. If they trigger higher prices and rising unemployment rates, his presidency may soon be on the rocks.\n\nMr. Trump spent a solid chunk of his long speech blaming his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, for high inflation, while defending his tariff plan. In a notable moment, he tacitly admitted the tariffs might cause short-term economic pain.\n\n\"Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again. And it's happening, and it will happen rather quickly. There'll be a little disturbance, but we're OK with that. It won't be much,\" he promised.\n\nHe said that wider reciprocal tariffs will land on April 2.\n\n\"I wanted to make it April 1st, but I didn't want to be accused of April Fool's Day,\" he said. \"I'm a very superstitious person.\"\n\nThe acrimony in the room was palpable all night, in both directions. Not long after Mr. Trump began his speech, Democratic Rep. Al Green of Texas stood up and shouted that he didn't have a mandate to cut Medicaid (as might occur through Republican legislation), waving his cane at the president. After refusing to sit down, he was escorted out of the House chamber, as some Republican lawmakers gleefully chanted \"sha-nah-nah-nah, hey hey hey, goodbye.\"\n\nMr. Trump opened his speech by bragging about his 2024 election win. He relitigated his criminal cases: \"We ended weaponized government where, as an example, a sitting president is allowed to viciously prosecute his political opponent, like me. How did that work out? Not too good,\" he said. He slammed Democrats on border security. He went on a long riff making misleading claims about widespread Social Security fraud based on deceptive figures about people over the age of 100 in the program's database that he suggested were receiving benefits. He executed made-for-TV moments, like making a 13-year-old who had been diagnosed with brain cancer an honorary U.S. Secret Service agent.\n\nAnd time and again, Mr. Trump gleefully trolled Democrats.\n\n\"This is my fifth such speech to Congress, and once again, I look at the Democrats in front of me, and I realize there is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy, or to make them stand or smile or applaud. Nothing I can do,\" he said early on. \"For the good of our nation, let's work together, and let's truly make America great again.\"\n\nHe later interrupted his remarks to mock Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts as \"Pocahontas,\" his longtime nickname for her. Senator Warren clapped sardonically, and told reporters afterward that Mr. Trump's speech had been \"one lie heaped on another.\"\n\nDemocrats tried - and largely failed - to find a cohesive way to push back. As Mr. Trump boasted about his strong support for law enforcement, some in the chamber yelled back \"Jan. 6,\" referring to his supporters' Capitol riot, which wounded many police officers. Democratic lawmakers filed out in dribs and drabs, though most of them weren't shown on TV broadcasts. They held up black-and-white signs saying \"Musk steals\" and \"False.\" But the pushback was disjointed.\n\nMr. Trump went very long, basking in the moment. He was at the podium for just under 100 minutes, the longest joint session or State of the Union in modern history.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Vance as his running mate, former President Donald Trump has picked an articulate young firebrand whose politics align closely with his own. It's a ticket that reinforces Mr. Trump's root-and-branch makeover of the Republican Party in his own image, one that Senator Vance, a self-described \"Never Trump guy\"-turned-archloyalist, has come to embrace and embody: pugnacious, populist, and nationalist.\n\nMr. Vance, a first-term senator just shy of his 40th birthday, is one of the youngest vice presidential candidates in U.S. history. Should he be elected in November, he would become a next-generation leader of Mr. Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" movement and his presumed successor, given Mr. Trump's advanced age and presidential term limits.\n\nAs the author of \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" his popular memoir about growing up in Ohio in a working-class family struggling with poverty and addiction, Mr. Vance could also help the GOP ticket in key Midwestern states that Mr. Trump lost in 2020. On his social media platform, Mr. Trump wrote Monday that his vice presidential pick would \"be strongly focused on the people he fought so brilliantly for, the American Workers and Farmers in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Minnesota, and far beyond.\" Of these, only Senator Vance's home state of Ohio was carried by Mr. Trump in 2020.\n\nWhile many presidential candidates choose a running mate who will balance out some aspect of the ticket, Donald Trump picked a partner who above all will reinforce and perhaps extend his brand.\n\nWhether vice presidential candidates in the modern era can deliver home states or regions or have much of an electoral impact overall is debatable, says Matt Grossmann, a political science professor at Michigan State University. What is clear, however, is that candidates who have little or no experience in government have become increasingly attractive to voters, who distrust the compromises involved in governing and prefer neophytes who haven't blemished their records with hard choices.\n\n\"Across all elections, but especially in Republican primaries, there's less of a premium, or almost a negative premium, for having political experience,\" says Professor Grossmann, who directs the Institute for Public Policy and Social Research.\n\nJames David Vance came to prominence with the success of his 2016 bestseller, \"Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis,\" about growing up in the Rust Belt town of Middletown, Ohio. Reviewers praised the book as a window into the distress experienced by deindustrialized regions in an era of bipartisan support in Washington for free-trade deals. Mr. Trump's surprise election win and his evocation of communities that had been \"left behind\" boosted the well-timed book, which was later turned into a film by director Ron Howard.\n\nSenator Vance served in the Marine Corps and then attended Ohio State University and Yale Law School, where a professor encouraged him to write a memoir. He worked for a venture capital firm in San Francisco, investing in tech companies, before moving back to Ohio, where he started a nonprofit working to tackle addiction and other issues. The nonprofit shut down after two years. Mr. Vance pivoted to politics after Ohio Sen. Rob Portman announced his retirement, creating an open seat in 2022.\n\nIn a crowded 2022 GOP Senate primary, Mr. Vance had the backing of Mr. Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., as well as Peter Thiel, a Silicon Valley billionaire known for his libertarian politics. Mr. Vance won the primary after Mr. Trump endorsed him toward the end over more experienced Ohio politicians, and the first-time candidate went on to a solid general election victory over his Democratic rival, Rep. Tim Ryan.\n\nThe endorsement came after Mr. Vance apologized for his past criticisms of Mr. Trump, including comparing him in 2016 to Adolf Hitler. He said Mr. Trump turned out to be a \"great president\" who had proved him and other doubters wrong. He has indicated that he would have made a different decision on Jan. 6, 2021, than then-Vice President Mike Pence, whose refusal to bend to Mr. Trump's pressure to challenge the certification of the election was part of what fueled the riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\n\"If I had been vice president, I would have told the states like Pennsylvania, Georgia, and so many others that we needed to have multiple slates of electors, and I think the U.S. Congress should have fought over it from there,\" Senator Vance told ABC's George Stephanopoulos earlier this year.\n\nTo Mr. Trump, who never held public office before he became president, Senator Vance's relative lack of experience in government was not disqualifying. Unlike in 2016, when Mr. Trump chose former Indiana Governor Pence as his running mate to bolster his standing with evangelical conservatives, Mr. Trump isn't trying to win over skeptical GOP constituencies.\n\nIn fact, the choice of Senator Vance indicates the opposite. \"It's not about outreach,\" says Joel Goldstein, professor emeritus of law at St. Louis University and an expert on the vice presidency. \"It's totally reinforcing.\"\n\nThis reflects Mr. Trump's current strength - both within his party and in the race against President Joe Biden. Other candidates vetted for vice president included Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, another Trump-critic-turned-ally, and Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota, who ran in the GOP presidential primary.\n\n\"For a candidate that's winning this race and seems to have already unified the party, that's a smart strategy,\" says GOP pollster Robert Blizzard in a text message, calling it a \"safe\" choice. \"Vance will not help Trump win over new voters, but he also will not alienate any part of his winning coalition.\"\n\nPresidential nominees often pick running mates who help balance out the ticket in some way. But as a former president, Mr. Trump had more leeway to name a vice president based on loyalty and personal chemistry. Senator Vance appears to have won him over, in part, by being a deft political communicator, as well as a channel to wealthy tech donors, a constituency that often leans Democratic.\n\nBut his main calling card may have been his willingness to play attack dog against Mr. Trump's enemies. After Saturday's assassination attempt against Mr. Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, and before any information about the shooter was known, Mr. Vance wrote on social media : \"The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to President Trump's attempted assassination.\"\n\nThat reaction to the shooting put him at the outer edge of responses by Republican politicians, who mostly called for calm and refuted political violence, says Professor Goldstein. Mr. Trump's decision to pick Mr. Vance as his running mate \"runs strongly counter to any talk of unity or dialing down the rhetoric. Vance is the one who most clearly mirrors Trump's MAGA approach.\"\n\nPerhaps the starkest contrast with other potential vice presidents is in foreign policy: Senator Vance is broadly skeptical about U.S. military interventions abroad, unlike the older guard of internationalists in his caucus, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nDuring his brief spell in Congress, Mr. Vance has not passed any significant legislation, but has focused on foreign policy and the Trump agenda of economic protectionism and restrictions on immigration. He has opposed U.S. aid to Ukraine and has said Ukraine should cede territory seized by Russian troops in 2022 in order to end the war. He argues that an open-ended U.S. commitment to Ukraine, a smaller military power than Russia, is a recipe for prolonged war, not peace.\n\nOpposition to military commitments with foreign allies is a political stance with a long history in the Republican Party, says Edward Miller, a political historian at Northeastern University. Its standard-bearer in the 1940s was another Ohio senator, Robert Taft, who opposed U.S. involvement in NATO.\n\n\"Vance is a throwback to that Robert Taft, 'America First' anti-internationalism,\" says Professor Miller, who studies far-right political movements. In 1952, Taft sought the GOP presidential nomination, but lost out to Dwight Eisenhower.\n\nIn interviews, Senator Vance has praised Mr. Trump for rejecting the economic orthodoxy on free trade and immigration that has mostly benefited elites at the expense of working families. He told The New York Times' Ross Douthat that \"center-left liberals who are doing very well, and center-right conservatives who are doing very well, have an incredible blind spot about how much their success is built on a system that is not serving people who they should be serving.\"\n\nAs was made abundantly clear at the opening of the Republican National Convention on Monday night, as vice president Mr. Vance would play second fiddle to the main act, a politician who has perhaps the world's greatest brand recognition, for better or worse. The success of presidential tickets rarely turns on the running mate, says Professor Goldstein - but it could matter in a close contest. \"The impact tends to be marginal, but many of our elections are decided at the margins.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Mr. Krishnan favors the ability to bring more skilled immigrants into the U.S.\n\nMs. Loomer declared the stance to be \"not America First policy\" and said the tech executives who have aligned themselves with the president-elect were doing so to enrich themselves.\n\nMuch of the debate played out on the social media network X, which Mr. Musk owns.\n\nMs. Loomer's comments sparked a back-and-forth with venture capitalist and former PayPal executive David Sacks, whom Mr. Trump has tapped to be the \"White House A.I. & Crypto Czar.\" Mr. Musk and Mr. Ramaswamy, whom Mr. Trump has tasked with finding ways to cut the federal government, weighed in, defending the tech industry's need to bring in foreign workers.\n\nIt bloomed into a larger debate with more figures from the hard-right weighing in about the need to hire U.S. workers, whether values in American culture can produce the best engineers, free speech on the internet, the newfound influence tech figures have in Mr. Trump's world, and what his political movement stands for.\n\nMr. Trump has not yet weighed in on the rift, and his presidential transition team did not respond to a message seeking comment.\n\nMr. Musk, the world's richest man who has grown remarkably close to the president-elect, was a central figure in the debate, not only for his stature in Trump's movement but his stance on the tech industry's hiring of foreign workers.\n\nTechnology companies say H-1B visas for skilled workers, used by software engineers and others in the tech industry, are critical for hard-to-fill positions. But critics have said they undercut U.S. citizens who could take those jobs. Some on the right have called for the program to be eliminated, not expanded.\n\nBorn in South Africa, Mr. Musk was once on a H-1B visa himself and defended the industry's need to bring in foreign workers.\n\n\"There is a permanent shortage of excellent engineering talent,\" he said in a post. \"It is the fundamental limiting factor in Silicon Valley.\"\n\nMr. Trump's own positions over the years have reflected the divide in his movement.\n\nHis tough immigration policies, including his pledge for a mass deportation, were central to his winning presidential campaign. He has focused on immigrants who come into the U.S. illegally but he has also sought curbs on legal immigration, including family-based visas.\n\nAs a presidential candidate in 2016, Mr. Trump called the H-1B visa program \"very bad\" and \"unfair\" for U.S. workers. After he became president, Mr. Trump in 2017 issued a \"Buy American and Hire American\" executive order, which directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to ensure H-1B visas were awarded to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants to protect American workers.\n\nThe president-elect's businesses, however, have hired foreign workers, including waiters and cooks at his Mar-a-Lago club, and his social media company behind his Truth Social app has used the the H-1B program for highly skilled workers.\n\nDuring his 2024 campaign, as he made immigration his signature issue, Mr. Trump said immigrants in the country illegally are \"poisoning the blood of our country\" and promised to carry out the largest deportation operation in U.S. history.\n\nBut in a sharp departure from his usual alarmist message around immigration generally, Mr. Trump told a podcast this year that he wants to give automatic green cards to foreign students who graduate from U.S. colleges.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\n\"I think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country,\" he told the \"All-In\" podcast with people from the venture capital and technology world.\n\nThose comments came on the cusp of Mr. Trump's budding alliance with tech industry figures, but he did not make the idea a regular part of his campaign message or detail any plans to pursue such changes.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

But if Trump were to win the presidency and then turn it down, political scientists would probably throw in the towel on their profession all together.\n\nHowever, some journalists, academics, and former aides say it is a scenario worth discussing.\n\n\"It is, of course, entirely possible that Mr. Trump is playing coy to earn more news coverage,\" writes the Times' Jason Horowitz . \"But the notion of the intensely competitive Mr. Trump's being more interested in winning the presidency than serving as president is not exactly a foreign concept to close observers of this presidential race.\"\n\nIn March, Stephanie Cegielski, once the communications director of the Trump-supporting Make America Great Again Super PAC, penned an open letter to Trump supporters (among whom she no longer counts herself). In the letter, Ms. Cegielski says Trump's campaign initially had the best-case-scenario goal of second place.\n\n\"The Trump camp would have been satisfied to see him polling at 12% and taking second place to a candidate who might hold 50%. His candidacy was a protest candidacy,\" she writes. \"I don't think even Trump thought he would get this far. And I don't even know that he wanted to, which is perhaps the scariest prospect of all.\"\n\nAs Ralf Michaels, a professor at the Duke University School of Law, wrote for the Huffington Post in February, Trump's love of winning is disassociated from his eagerness to be Commander in Chief. And his intense love for winning, and for himself, has blinded him to the actual possibilities ahead:\n\n\"Will either Trump, or voters, realize this before it is too late? Trump himself may not. For some time, he seemed to give signs of wanting to quit. When he said that he could shoot someone on 5th Avenue and not lose voters, it was perhaps not a sign of his confidence, or his disdain for his base, but a cry for help. But if that was so, it did not last long. Trump cares so much about winning, he may well pay the price of actually having to be president. When he gets tired of it will be too late.\"\n\nBut Russell Verney, a former strategist for the Texas billionaire and former third-party presidential candidate Ross Perot, tells the Times that the only reason these speculations are being fueled is because Trump is an outsider candidate, and has a career to return to if he chooses. Roger Stone, a political advisor for Trump, concurs.\n\n\"If he got elected president, he'd certainly serve ,\" Mr. Stone told the Times. \"I'm fairly certain about that. You think he'd resign? I don't see that happening.\"\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\nBut others insist that Trump wants to win the presidency without having to actually be president.\n\n\"I'll say it again: Trump never intended to be the candidate. But his pride is too out of control to stop him now,\" Cegielski adds in her letter. \"He doesn't want the White House. He just wants to be able to say that he could have run the White House.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Log in to hide ads .\n\nLoading...\n\nDec. 16, 2019, 4:42 p.m. ET | Ames, Iowa\n\nThroughout the Democratic primary, Joe Biden has argued he's the candidate best positioned to beat President Donald Trump: the personable, been-there-done-that former vice president who's moderate enough to appeal to independents in key swing states, and maybe even some Republicans.\n\nBut while casting himself as the president's strongest opponent, Mr. Biden is also leaning into a message that is in some ways uncannily reminiscent of Mr. Trump's own pitch in 2016 - his own variety of \"Make America Great Again.\"\n\nMr. Biden frequently speaks about reviving the middle class, which he calls the \"backbone\" of this country. The rest of the world is laughing at our once-respected nation, he tells voters, and only a change in leadership will restore America to the prosperous superpower it once was. On a recent bus tour in Iowa, the former vice president tells audiences what a shame it is that parents have to turn down the volume when the president appears on TV, for fear of their children hearing something nasty or inappropriate. A grandfather who uses words like \"malarkey,\" he jokingly apologizes that one side of the room has to look at his bald spot while he speaks.\n\nRemember when? Nostalgia often is a feature of ads, not political campaigns, which usually focus on the future. But Joe Biden, like President Donald Trump, tends to hark back to a \"better time.\"\n\nTypically, political campaigns, especially presidential ones, focus on the future. Candidates offer fresh visions for the country, detailing innovative plans that would usher in a new, modern era of peace and prosperity.\n\nBut if Mr. Biden, who served in the Senate for more than three decades, wins the Democratic nomination, then the general election next year will feature two septuagenarians who spend a great deal of time talking about the past.\n\n\"Advertisers have been using nostalgia for decades,\" says David Pizarro, a psychology professor at Cornell University. The Biden and Trump campaigns \"are taking a page from a strategy that has worked well for, say, Coca-Cola.\"\n\nAnd while it may be less common in politics than themes like hope or change, Mr. Pizarro says it makes sense that campaigns today would employ nostalgia as a tool. Because despite \"tons of things being way better than they ever have been\" - such as longer life expectancies and improvements in education, for example - most people believe the country is worse off now than in the past.\n\n\"Part of the reason is that it's easier now than ever to see all the bad things,\" says Mr. Pizarro. \"And because of that, it can really seem like things are getting worse and worse.\"\n\nOne difference between Mr. Biden's and Mr. Trump's use of nostalgia, says Mr. Pizarro, is the time period of their idyllic years. Mr. Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" can mean different things to different people, but it clearly harks back to a time well before the Obama years. By contrast, Mr. Biden is wrapping himself in the Obama presidency - hoping to benefit from the warm feelings many Democrats hold for the former president, and the desire of many voters to return to the relative \"normalcy\" of that era.\n\nIn Ames, Iowa, for example, a woman asks him about improving Amtrak, but before she sits down, she tells the former vice president: \"I back you because you worked well with Obama.\"\n\nThe same goes for Wartburg College students Makayla and Sidney in Waverly. \"For me, it was his connection with the Obama campaign,\" says Makayla, explaining why she decided to come hear Mr. Biden speak.\n\nTo be sure, Mr. Biden is also careful to cast his vision forward. When a voter at Iowa State asks him how he plans to repair the damage from President Trump's first term, he responds: \"I'm not going to just repair. I want to build on what Barack and I built.\" At a community college in Iowa Falls, he says he is \"more optimistic than I've ever been\" about the future of America.\n\n\"As Vice President Biden said, he's running not to take us back to a fondly remembered past, but to build on our accomplishments,\" says Bill Russo, the campaign's deputy communications director. That includes beefing up Obamacare by adding a Medicare-like public option, reentering the Paris climate agreement while looking to \"up the ante\" on climate change, and reauthorizing and updating the Violence Against Women Act to include modern problems like online harassment, Mr. Russo says.\n\nStill, the former vice president frequently evokes the past - particularly when speaking about America's image abroad.\n\nMr. Biden's \"No Malarkey!\" tour in Iowa coincided with the NATO summit in London where foreign leaders, including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, French President Emmanuel Macron, and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson were caught on tape appearing to mock President Trump. At first, Mr. Biden said he would wait to comment because of his personal policy of not criticizing presidents while on foreign soil. But by the end of the day, he was referencing the tape directly and his campaign had released an ad saying four more years of President Trump would make it difficult to ever \"recover America's standing.\"\n\nSubstantively, it makes sense that Mr. Biden would focus both on mending international relationships (he has more foreign policy experience than any of the other Democrats running), and restoring elements of the Obama era (he was there in the White House, after all).\n\nIt also makes sense stylistically, says Travis Ridout, co-founder of the Wesleyan Media Project, which tracks political advertising. One of Hillary Clinton's problems in 2016, he says, was that voters seemed to want change after eight years of the Obama administration. Mrs. Clinton tried to sell herself as a change candidate, but the message didn't really fit, since she was a longtime establishment figure who had served in the Obama administration. Mr. Biden would likely have similar difficulties if he tried to market himself that way.\n\n\"An 'I'm the change we need' message is just not going to work coming from Joe Biden,\" says Mr. Ridout. \"Authenticity is important in politics.\"\n\nRecently, Politico reported that Mr. Biden has been signaling to close allies that, if elected, he would likely serve only one term. The Biden campaign quickly issued a denial, saying Mr. Biden would not make a one-term pledge and that it is not something the former vice president is thinking about.\n\nBut Mr. Biden's age - he would be 82 years old at the end of his first term - may be his biggest liability as a candidate. And in some ways, he has been presenting himself as a kind of transition figure - a trusted, steady hand who can help stabilize the government after the chaos of the Trump years, while the nation figures out what it wants going forward.\n\nThat sense of familiarity may help explain why Mr. Biden has continued to hover at the top of national polls and in the top tier in Iowa and New Hampshire surveys, despite lackluster fundraising and smaller crowds than some of his rivals. Indeed, while other candidates have shot to the top of the pack at different times only to fall back again, Mr. Biden has shown steady resilience.\n\nThe most recent Iowa poll, from Emerson College, shows Mr. Biden back in the lead in the Hawkeye State, after a spate of November surveys showing Pete Buttigieg, the fresh-faced mayor of South Bend, Indiana, on top.\n\nMore than a dozen voters across four town halls say they are torn between Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg. At a Biden event in Iowa Falls, one woman says she is leaning toward Mr. Buttigieg because the country might need a younger president. Another says she is leaning toward Mr. Biden because of his experience, but would like to see Mr. Buttigieg as his vice president.\n\n\"I would vote for [Biden] in a minute if he gets the nomination,\" says Kurt Kelsey after hearing Mr. Biden speak in Iowa Falls. Still, he and his wife, Arlisse, who farm corn, soybeans, and hay, say they're leaning toward some of the other Democratic candidates. Mr. Kelsey likes New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and Mayor Pete, and Mrs. Kelsey says she likes Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

      "text": "Trump open to tariff negotiations, contradicting White House aides\n\nThis is CNBC's coverage of how U.S. trade partners, industries and employers responded to President Donald Trump's new tariffs.\n\nWhat you need to know\n\nCNBC's reporters covered the tariffs and their effects, live on air and online from our bureaus in Washington; London; Singapore; San Francisco; and Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey.\n\nRead CNBC's continued coverage of Trump's historic tariff plan here.\n\nThe weekend is looking like a breeze for Trump - if not for stock market investors hammered by the fallout from his new tariffs.\n\nThe White House posted a tweet showing Trump walking with his hair, tie and suit jacket blown back from the wind, with the italicized message, \"Almost Friday.\"\n\nThe tweet's jaunty vibe contrasted with a metaphorical bloodbath on Wall Street, where the major stock indices all suffered big drops.\n\n- Dan Mangan\n\nNissan Motor's luxury Infiniti brand has indefinitely paused production of two Mexico-built crossovers for the U.S. in response to the newly imposed 25% tariffs on imported vehicles by Trump.\n\nIn a memo to the brand's retailers, Infiniti Americas Vice President Tiago Castro said QX50 and QX55 output for the U.S. is halted \"until further notice\" due to the tariffs, Automotive News reported Thursday.\n\nA company spokesman confirmed the actions Thursday afternoon to CNBC and said the Japanese automaker is reviewing its \"production and supply chain operations to identify optimal solutions for efficiency and sustainability.\"\n\n\"We will continue to evaluate the impact, as well as market needs, to make any additional adjustments to production,\" Nissan said in an emailed statement.\n\nSeparately, Nissan on Thursday confirmed it will maintain two shifts of production of the Nissan Rogue crossover at its Smyrna, Tennessee, plant that is free of the new auto tariffs.\n\nNissan had planned to scale back Rogue production in Smyrna to a single shift starting this month.\n\n- Michael Wayland\n\nThe European Union and Switzerland, two crucial markets for luxury goods, were hit with tariffs of 20% and 31%, respectively.\n\nCompared with their luxury peers, Swiss watchmakers stand to be most affected, JPMorgan analysts said in a note.\n\nAnalysts highlighted Swiss conglomerates Swatch Group, which counts Omega among its brands, and Richemont, owner of Piaget, noting their thin margins. The Swatch Group fell nearly 4% and shares of Compagnie Financière Richemont SA dropped 6.3% in trading.\n\nGucci owner Kering and Burberry are also vulnerable, according to the analysts, citing weak profits and \"less pricing power to mitigate some of the impact given their currently softer brand momentum.\" Kering and Burberry shares fell 7.5% and 9.2%, respectively.\n\nAs for luxury powerhouse LVMH , analysts estimated its wine and spirits division, which includes cognac brand Hennessy, would be most negatively affected.\n\nHermès faces the least damage before mitigation, estimated at roughly 3% to 5% by JPMorgan. Analysts said Hermès has less reliance on U.S. sales, high profitability and strong pricing power. LVMH ended down more than 3%.\n\n- Hayley Cuccinello\n\nCorrection: This post has been updated to reflect that Hermes is a separate, publicly traded company.\n\nAfter multiple White House aides insisted that the new tariffs were not a negotiation, Trump said he would be open to negotiating with other countries about the duties.\n\nTrump said he would be open to tariff talks with other counties if they offer something phenomenal, Reuters reported him saying on Air Force One.\n\nTop trade aide Peter Navarro told CNBC less than an hour earlier that the sweeping tariffs are \"not a negotiation.\"\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nSome big names in the market took the brunt of the punishment on Thursday, with Apple and Nike among the iconic American companies contributing in a major way to the S&P 500's worst day since 2020 .\n\nBut the tariff wall that Trump is building around the U.S. is estimated at nearly $1 trillion, according to data shared with CNBC by Trade Partnership Worldwide. They will have profound consequences throughout the market and global supply chain, across each American state and into the lives of every consumer. Trade experts are skeptical that negotiations will result in quick deals.\n\nAny manufacturing renaissance in the U.S. will come much later than an acute manufacturing crisis, experts told CNBC. U.S. CEOs, especially those in critical industries such as medical devices, are headed to Capitol Hill to plead their case.\n\nIn a nutshell, it \"isn't good news for the global economy,\" as shipping giant Maersk put it.\n\nRead the full story: Trump's other wall: $1 trillion in tariffs wrapped around U.S. economy - Lori Ann LaRocco\n\nTop Trump trade advisor Peter Navarro denied that Trump's new tariffs are being used as a tool to negotiate better trade terms with other countries.\n\n\"This is not a negotiation,\" Navarro said on CNBC's \"Closing Bell: Overtime.\"\n\n\"This is not that. This is a national emergency,\" he said.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nThe newly imposed tariffs pose a drag on growth, said Lindsay Rosner, Goldman Sachs head of multi-asset fixed income. The only question is how much.\n\nThe extent of the drag will depend on several factors, such as other countries imposing retaliatory tariffs and the Trump administration's willingness to negotiate, Rosner told journalists at a conference at Goldman Sachs' Manhattan headquarters.\n\nShe also noted that sectors and companies will not be equally affected by the tariffs.\n\nRosner is also waiting to see how the Federal Reserve responds. \"They've got to push back here because I think the big word of 'stagflation' is real here,\" she said.\n\nStagflation occurs when inflation rises as economic growth slows.\n\nFinally, Rosner said she believes Wednesday's tariffs were just the beginning and wonders what the Trump administration will impose next.\n\n\"I think we all know there is more to come,\" she said.\n\n- Hayley Cuccinello\n\nShares in top U.S. exporter Boeing tumbled 10% and other aerospace stocks such as engine maker GE Aerospace also fell, as companies assessed tariff effects on their global supply chains.\n\nGE has a joint venture with France's Safran, and together they provide parts and build best-selling engines under their shared CFM brand. Those engines power Boeing and Airbus narrow-body planes.\n\nAircraft are made with thousands of parts from all across the world. Even European plane maker Airbus, which has expanded its final assembly lines in Mobile, Alabama, over the past decade, relies on components made outside the U.S.\n\nBoeing, which assembles its 787 Dreamliner jets in South Carolina, has a supply chain spanning from Japan to Italy.\n\n\"There are still a lot of unknowns, such as how they are applied to aerospace, which tier of suppliers or customers will pay for them, and how trading partners will respond,\" Jefferies aerospace analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu wrote Thursday.\n\nShe noted that aircraft and defense products boost U.S. exports and have been \"insulated via The Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft, but raw [material] price inflation is unavoidable.\"\n\n- Leslie Josephs\n\nHousehold staples such as coffee, bananas and toilet paper will likely get more expensive as the Trump administration's tariffs go into effect.\n\nThe Consumer Brands Association, an industry trade group that represents Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble and other consumer giants, is asking for exemptions for key ingredients and inputs that cannot be produced at scale in the U.S.\n\nAs an example, the CBA pointed to the fact that the U.S. climate limits domestic production of tropical fruits, coffee and spices. The countries that do produce those goods, such as Guatemala and Madagascar, have been slapped with tariffs that range from 10% to 47%. Manufacturers and retailers will likely pass on the higher ingredient costs to shoppers.\n\nInedible staples, such as toilet paper and shampoo, could become more expensive, too, due to higher costs for inputs such as wood pulp and palm oil, the CBA said.\n\nRead the full story here .\n\n- Amelia Lucas\n\nFederal Reserve officials could get caught in a policy box if tariffs spike inflation and weaken growth, diminishing the chances of an interest rate cut anytime soon.\n\nA general consensus emerged on Wall Street that unless the announced duties are negotiated down, core inflation this year likely will run north of 3%, and economic growth could be flat or negative as unemployment rises. In that case, the Fed would find itself torn between its \"dual mandate\" of full employment and low inflation.\n\n\"The problem for the Fed is that they're going to have to be very, be very reactive,\" said Jonathan Pingle, chief U.S. economist at UBS.\n\n- Jeff Cox\n\nU.S. markets continue to fall as investors digest news of Trump's far-reaching tariffs. The selling has been accelerating into the close of trading at 4 p.m. ET. Read CNBC's full market coverage here.\n\n- Elisabeth Cordova\n\nThe formula used by the White House to determine its sweeping tariff policy looks like it could have come from artificial intelligence chatbots, according to The Verge , which on Thursday used some quick work done by journalist James Surowiecki and some commenters on X.\n\nSurowiecki wrote on X that it appears as if the Trump administration \"just took our trade deficit with that country and divided it by the country's exports to us.\" The Verge said its reporters got similar results when they asked popular AI chatbots - including ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude and Grok - for \"easy\" ways to solve trade deficits or to put the U.S. on an \"even playing field\" with other countries.\n\nThe four bots gave \"the same fundamental suggestion,\" the Verge said, though some of the details provided by each one differed.\n\n- CJ Haddad\n\nFederal Trade Commission Chair Andrew Ferguson warned companies against price fixing in light of tariffs.\n\nThe FTC \"will be watching closely to make sure American companies are vigorously competing on prices,\" he said in a post on social media site X .\n\n\"These necessary tariffs should not be interpreted as a green light for price fixing or any other unlawful behavior,\" Ferguson wrote. \"We will always protect American consumers.\"\n\n- Michele Luhn\n\nTrump said the response to his staggering new tariff plan is \"going very well.\"\n\n\"The markets are going to boom, the stock is going to boom, the country is going to boom,\" he told reporters as he departed the White House.\n\n\"The rest of the world wants to see, is there any way they can make a deal?\" he said.\n\nTrump pointed to investment pledges that some companies have made in recent weeks, claiming that it totals almost $7 trillion.\n\n\"You'll see how it's going to turn out. Our country is going to boom,\" he said.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nAltimeter Capital CEO Brad Gerstner said Thursday that Trump's tariff plan was more drastic than administration officials had signaled and will prove damaging if it is not scaled back. Speaking on CNBC's \" Halftime Report ,\" he said major business leaders in the U.S. share that opinion.\n\n\"I talked to probably 10 CEOs who are all in the Business Roundtable - these are CEOs of the largest companies in America - overnight, and [they all] think this is a huge mistake. They think this is too much, that it will have lasting and cascading negative repercussions for the United States and the global economy,\" Gerstner said.\n\nGerstner did not specify who spoke with him, but the members of the Business Roundtable include the CEOs of the biggest companies from multiple industries, including firms such as Apple, Bank of America, Boeing and FedEx.\n\nGerstner, who generally focuses on the technology sector as an investor, said Trump's tariff plan \"looks like protectionism\" as opposed to a step toward more equitable global trade.\n\n- Jesse Pound\n\nTrump is set to depart the White House and head to his Doral Golf Club in Miami, where he will attend a dinner for LIV, the pro golf tour that has previously held tournaments at Trump's properties.\n\nAfter the event, Trump will fly to his Mar-a-Lago resort home in Palm Beach, according to the White House.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nAltimeter Capital CEO Brad Gerstner said chipmaker Nvidia is positioned to weather Trump's broad tariffs.\n\nNvidia produces the graphics processing units, or GPUs, that power the artificial intelligence boom. The company may be better positioned to withstand the effect of tariffs because semiconductors, like GPUs, are on the list of exceptions - what Gerstner called a \"wise exception.\"\n\n\"The growth and the demand for GPUs is off the charts,\" he told CNBC's \"Fast Money Halftime Report.\"\n\nGerstner said he is concerned about the potential for a recession due to Trump's tariffs but is relatively bullish on Nvidia, saying the \"negative impact from tariffs will be much less than in other areas.\"\n\n- Ashley Capoot\n\nThe new wave of tariffs could have drastically different effects on the two leading U.S. dollar-store chains.\n\nDollar Tree 's stock dropped more than 10%, declining along with shares of other retailers that rely on manufacturing in China and Vietnam. But shares of rival Dollar General climbed more than 4%.\n\nTrump will slap an additional 34% tariff on imports from China, bringing new duties implemented on the nation's goods during his second term to 54%.\n\nThat is worse news for Dollar Tree because according to a note from UBS analysts this week, the company's exposure to China is about 32% of its cost of goods sold. Dollar General only has about 4% exposure.\n\nDuring an earnings call last month, Dollar Tree CEO Michael Creedon said the company could hike prices to help offset tariffs.\n\n- Jacob Pramuk\n\nLinkedIn co-founder and venture capitalist Reid Hoffman criticized Trump's tariffs policy, writing in a post on social media site X , \"This is a long game to hurt everyday Americans and consolidate power at the top.\"\n\nHoffman is a major Democratic donor and was an outspoken supporter of Kamala Harris during her presidential run. He has frequently criticized the Trump administration and previously expressed concern that Trump could retaliate against business leaders who did not back him.\n\nIn his post Thursday, Hoffman said the Trump administration has eroded trust in U.S. markets, \"first with crypto grifts\" and now with tariff policies \"drafted by a team that can't even do basic mathematics.\"\n\n- Annie Palmer\n\nSmall-cap stocks have entered bear market territory as markets reel in the wake of Trump's tariff announcement. Watch CNBC's market blog for all the key updates as they happen.\n\n- Sean Conlon\n\nGeneral Motors plans to temporarily increase pickup truck production at a plant in Indiana as the auto industry adjusts to Trump's 25% tariffs on imported vehicles .\n\nGM confirmed the plans without mentioning tariffs: \"General Motors will be making operational adjustments at Fort Wayne Assembly, including hiring temporary employees, to support current manufacturing and business needs. We continuously update and revise production schedules as part of our standard process of evaluating and aligning to manage vehicle inventory.\"\n\nThe increase in workers is in addition to the supplemental workers GM was already hiring to support summer breaks and time off for their regular employees, according to a person familiar with the plans.\n\nGM produces its crucial, highly profitable pickup trucks such as the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra at various plants in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.\n\nThe Detroit automaker has not cut production at any plants as a result of the tariffs, like its crosstown rival Stellantis is doing, according to the person, who was not authorized to speak to media.\n\n- Michael Wayland\n\nAmerican drinkers may be swapping out their Aperol spritzes for margaritas this summer.\n\nThe Trump administration's 20% tariff on goods imported from the European Union will hit European wines, spirits and beer, Reuters reports. Mexican-imported canned beer such as Modelo, the best-selling beer in the U.S., will also face a new 25% tariff.\n\nShares of Constellation Brands , which owns Mexican-brewed beers such as Modelo and Corona, are down less than 1% in afternoon trading. Investors have been anticipating the levies since Trump's election.\n\nBut the tariffs were not as harsh as the 200% duties Trump threatened on European wine, Champagne and spirits last month. The president also held off on imposing the 25% tariffs on Mexican tequila and Canadian whisky, lifting shares of Campari , Heineken and Diageo higher.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\n- Amelia Lucas\n\nMatt Mittelsteadt, a tech policy research fellow at the Cato Institute, said in a statement that the new tariffs \"directly threaten American AI. These massive tax hikes are slamming during the exact window U.S. industry has to set the global standard - risking innovation and ceding the market.\"\n\nShares of CoreWeave , which recently became the first pure-play artificial intelligence company to IPO, were down more than 17% on Thursday. Nvidia stock was down nearly 7%, while shares of Microsoft and Google were both down more than 2%.\n\n- Hayden Field\n\nPershing Square CEO Bill Ackman encouraged foreign leaders to reach out to Trump \"immediately\" to negotiate, according to a post on social media site X on Thursday.\n\nAckman endorsed Trump in the 2024 election and has been a vocal supporter of the president on social media. In his post Thursday, he described Trump as a \"dealmaker\" and a \"tough, but fair negotiator\" who thinks about the world as a series of transactions.\n\n\"I expect Trump will reward the early dealmakers with fairer deals than those that wait to sit down at the negotiating table,\" Ackman wrote. \"Countries that respond with additional tariffs on our goods will be severely punished. The carrot and the stick writ large, Big Boy style.\"\n\n- Ashley Capoot\n\nCanada will impose 25% tariffs on vehicles imported from the U.S., Prime Minister Mark Carney announced, matching Trump's tariffs on imported vehicles that took effect today.\n\nThe tariffs will only apply to autos that are not compliant with the USMCA, the North American free trade agreement, Carney said. He said the tariffs will not affect auto parts or vehicle content from Mexico.\n\n\"We know the benefits of our integrated production system,\" Carney said.\n\nHe added that Canada is \"developing a framework for auto producers to avoid our counter tariffs, as long as they maintain their production and investment in Canada.\"\n\n- Michele Luhn\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Trump \"is not going to back off\" his newly announced tariffs.\n\n\"I don't think there's any chance\" that Trump will reverse course, Lutnick said in a CNN interview. \"This is the reordering of global trade, right? That's what's going to happen,\" he said.\n\nAsked to clarify, Lutnick said, \"the president is not going to back off.\"\n\nBut, he added, \"countries can fix their tariffs, their non-tariff trade barriers, which are much, much rougher.\"\n\nThe comments came as some Trump allies have expressed hope that the sweeping tariffs are negotiating tools to secure better trade relationships, rather than permanent import taxes.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nTrump's tariffs have boxed in retailers - and jeweler Pandora is not immune.\n\nThe Danish company said it expects an annual hit of 1.2 billion crowns, or roughly $178 million, from the new duties on U.S. imports, before it takes any steps to mitigate the effects. For 2025, it expects a hit of 700 million crowns, or about $103 million.\n\nPandora said it could raise prices or change its supply chain to help offset the levies.\n\nThe jeweler said U.S. tariffs of 36% on imports from Thailand will have the biggest effect on its business. Pandora said it made 92% of its jewelry at facilities in Thailand as of last year .\n\n- Jacob Pramuk\n\nA bipartisan bill introduced to the Senate seeks to require that Congress approve tariffs if they are to continue 60 days after their implementation, NBC News reported.\n\nThe bill also would require the president to notify Congress within 24 hours of announcing new tariffs.\n\n\"For too long, Congress has delegated its clear authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce to the executive branch,\" said Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who is co-sponsoring the bill with Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash.\n\nIt is not clear when or even if the bill will be voted on.\n\n- Dan Mangan\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick pushed back on the looming prospect of grocery prices suddenly rising as a result of Trump's new tariffs.\n\n\"I don't think that's going to happen,\" Lutnick said on CNN when asked what he would tell Americans who voted for Trump and are about to face higher store prices.\n\nLutnick said that when the U.S. opens the markets that he says are blocked by other countries, \"our volumes grow, our farmers will thrive, and the price of groceries will come down.\"\n\n\"Let Donald Trump run the global economy. He knows what he's doing,\" Lutnick said.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nInvestors are seeking safety in fast-food chains, betting consumers will trade down to cheaper restaurant meals as tariffs weigh on their wallets.\n\nShares of McDonald's , Yum Brands and Restaurant Brands International are up more than 1%, while other publicly traded restaurant companies' shares take a beating.\n\nShares of Chipotle Mexican Grill and Texas Roadhouse are both down 3%. The two chains have reported stronger sales than the broader industry in recent quarters. Other eateries have seen even steeper declines in their share prices. Starbucks stock dropped 11%, Shake Shack's shares slid 13% and Sweetgreen's tumbled 16%.\n\nTypically, during economic downturns, fast-food chains report stronger sales than other restaurants, as price-sensitive consumers trade down from full-service dining and fast-casual lunches to less pricey combo meals at McDonald's or Burger King.\n\nThe restaurant industry is already anticipating that the latest wave of tariffs will mean higher menu prices for diners.\n\n\"The biggest concerns for restaurant operators - from community restaurants to national brands - are that tariffs will hike food and packaging costs and add uncertainty to managing availability, while pushing prices up for consumers,\" the National Restaurant Association said in a statement.\n\n- Amelia Lucas\n\nShares of GE HealthCare , which manufactures medical imaging, ultrasound and other health devices, tumbled more than 10% on Thursday following Trump's tariff announcement. GE HealthCare produces its products in more than 20 countries and serves customers in more than 160 countries around the globe, according to its website.\n\n\"Our top priorities are to make sure patient and customer deliveries for products and services are not interrupted under any circumstances and at the best quality and cost possible,\" a GE HealthCare spokesperson told CNBC.\n\n\"This is a dynamic issue,\" the spokesperson noted. \"Our teams are working on potential mitigation plans as these trade policies evolve. We will provide an update on our next earnings call.\"\n\nShares of Siemens Healthineers , a German med tech company, fell nearly 7% on Thursday. The company did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.\n\n- Ashley Capoot\n\nTrump's aggressive and sweeping \"reciprocal tariffs\" affected more than 180 countries, from major trading partners to even tiny islands and remote locations.\n\nThe tariff plan targeted numerous external Australian territories, including Heard and McDonald Islands, one of the most remote locations on earth, populated by seals and penguins.\n\nNorfolk Island, also an Australian territory with a population of nearly 2,000 people, was hit with some of the highest tariffs of 29%, despite Australia only facing 10% tariffs.\n\n\"I'm not quite sure that Norfolk Island, with respect to it, is a trade competitor with the giant economy of the United States, but that just shows and exemplifies the fact that nowhere on earth is safe from this,\" Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said, according to The Guardian.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\n- Sawdah Bhaimiya\n\nChipmaking stocks dropped Thursday as markets sold off after Trump revealed wide sweeping tariffs.\n\nAlthough the sector was excluded from the latest levies, duties targeting the sector are still coming. Semiconductors, which typically come to the U.S. in finished products such as personal computers, are also under pressure due to fears that tariffs will quell demand for technology gadgets and electronics.\n\nAs of late morning trading, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF shed nearly 7%. Qorvo and Micron Technology plunged more than 12% each, while Qualcomm, Broadcom and Lam Research each dropped more than 7%. Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing slumped more than 6%, while Advanced Micro Devices fell about 5%.\n\n- Samantha Subin\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron urged companies in his country to pause investments in the U.S. after Trump's imposition of sweeping tariffs.\n\nHe said Trump's tariffs are a shock for international trade after his meeting at the Élysée Palace with representatives of industries affected by the heavy levies.\n\nTrump's plan sets a 10% baseline tariff across the board, while adding steep duties on many countries, including 34% on China and 20% on the European Union.\n\n- Yun Li\n\nFormer Trump Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he believed \"the market can adjust\" to the new 10% baseline tariff on nearly all other countries, but hoped the larger tariff rates will be \"negotiated down.\"\n\n\"I do hope there's the ability to negotiate them down, because, as we've seen for certain businesses, it is going to take a long time to move that manufacturing base,\" he said on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street.\"\n\n\"And we've seen the stock market, particularly in certain stocks, react pretty negatively,\" he said.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nIn another executive action signed Wednesday, Trump ended the so-called de minimis exemption on China and Hong Kong that allowed shipments worth less than $800 to enter the U.S. duty free.\n\nThe trade loophole has helped Chinese cheap-goods manufacturers such as Temu and Shein flood the U.S. with inexpensive products.\n\nIt will end May 2, according to the executive order .\n\nTrump had previously ended de minimis in early February but paused that move days later following concerns it could overwhelm U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nOn a brutal day for the stock market, shares of retailers - including Target and Nike - have been hammered particularly hard.\n\nTarget, Nike, Wayfair , American Eagle Outfitters , Ugg and Hoka parent Deckers , as well as toymaker Hasbro all hit 52-week lows.\n\nRetailers are expected to face tough choices in the weeks and months ahead, as they manage higher costs from broad tariffs on imports from nations including China and Vietnam, which are major manufacturing hubs for shoes, clothing, toys, furniture and more.\n\nSome, such as Steve Madden , were slashing their sourcing from China in recent years and moving more production to other countries such as Vietnam. Yet, now, even imports from many of those alternative countries are subject to tariffs. Goods from Vietnam, for example, will face a 46% tariff.\n\nSome sectors of retail are particularly exposed: Nearly a third of footwear imports in the U.S. came from Vietnam in 2023, the most recent full-year data available, according to the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, an industry trade group.\n\nBarclays retail analyst Seth Sigman said retailers will have a hard time absorbing all of the steep additional costs or sharing them with vendors.\n\n\"Unfortunately, some of it will result in higher prices,\" he said.\n\n- Melissa Repko\n\nCNBC's senior economics reporter Steve Liesman and on-air editor Rick Santelli held an impromptu debate about the effect of Trump's tariffs on global trade.\n\nThe spirited exchange on \"Squawk Box\" followed an appearance from Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.\n\nWatch the full exchange below:\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nStellantis is idling production at two assembly plants in Canada and Mexico due to tariffs.\n\nRoughly 900 U.S.-represented employees at supporting plants will be temporarily laid off in addition to roughly 4,500 hourly workers at the Canadian plant. Workers at the plant in Mexico will still report to the plant but will not produce vehicles due to their contract terms, according to a company spokeswoman.\n\nThe downtime starts Monday and will last for two weeks at the automaker's Windsor Assembly Plant in Ontario, Canada, and the entire month of April at its Toluca Assembly Plant in Mexico.\n\n\"We are continuing to assess the medium- and long-term effects of these tariffs on our operations, but also have decided to take some immediate actions, including temporarily pausing production at some of our Canadian and Mexican assembly plants,\" said Antonio Filosa, Stellantis North American chief.\n\n- Michael Wayland, Michele Luhn\n\nVice President JD Vance argued that Trump's trade agenda, coupled with its deregulatory efforts and tax-cut plans, will ultimately bring down prices.\n\nBut \"we're not going to fix things overnight,\" he said in a Fox News interview Thursday morning when asked if costs will go up and for how long.\n\nHe framed the situation as one in which the Trump administration was tasked with fixing \"what was left to us\" by the Biden administration.\n\n\"You don't fix that stuff overnight. We know people are struggling. We're fighting as quickly as we can to fix what was left to us, but it's not going to happen immediately,\" Vance said.\n\nMany economists warn that Trump's sweeping tariff policies will raise prices and lower growth, and even some administration officials have acknowledged the import duties will cause at least temporary economic disruption.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nTariffs and economic uncertainty are threatening to slow construction of new hotels by driving up building-material costs, Baird's hotel analyst says.\n\nThe cost to build in the U.S. could now be as much as 10% higher because of tariffs, particularly on materials that are largely imported from China and Vietnam, Baird hotel analyst Michael Bellisario wrote. Construction of new hotels was already strained compared with before the Covid-19 pandemic because of higher costs and interest rates.\n\n\"Signings and starts could slow over the near term given heightened macroeconomic and trade policy uncertainties; projects' opening dates are likely to slip as well, in our view,\" he said in his Thursday note, adding that Hilton , Marriott and Choice Hotels International are the most exposed to U.S. construction headwinds.\n\nHotel stocks were all sharply lower in morning trading, and airline stocks, already battered this year, also fell. United was down more than 12% while American and Delta were each down more than 8%. Tariffs and economic weakness could add to both leisure and corporate bookings, while duties are set to drive up the cost of new aircraft.\n\n- Leslie Josephs\n\nPresident Trump's son Eric Trump says the first countries to negotiate a trade deal with his father \"will win,\" as he warned the world not to be among the last nations to cut such a deal.\n\n\"I wouldn't want to be the last country that tries to negotiate a trade deal with @realDonaldTrump ,\" Eric wrote in a post on social media site X.\n\n\"The first to negotiate will win - the last will absolutely lose. I have seen this movie my entire life,\" he wrote.\n\nBut Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick , in an interview with CNBC's \"Squawk Box,\" brushed aside the idea of countries winning exemptions from new tariffs on some products.\n\n\"I don't think the word 'exemption' is going to be a factor. I don't think that's such a thing,\" Lutnick said. \"I think what there's going to be is a world of fairness. Let's go try to figure out ways for the world to treat us more fairly and more properly.\"\n\n- Dan Mangan\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick brushed aside the idea that some imports from certain countries will win exemptions from the new U.S. tariffs.\n\n\"I don't think the word 'exemption' is going to be a factor. I don't think that's such a thing,\" Lutnick said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"\n\n\"I think what there's going to be is a world of fairness. Let's go try to figure out ways for the world to treat us more fairly and more properly,\" he said.\n\nLutnick also said other countries would be making a mistake if they impose their own reciprocal tariffs on the U.S. in retaliation.\n\n\"I don't think it's effective in the world to retaliate,\" Lutnick said. \"I mean, those things are silly. \"\n\n- Dan Mangan\n\nNew tariffs will raise the price of shoes that Americans buy and lead to cheaper-quality merchandise, says a major trade group.\n\nTrump's tariff policy \"is catastrophic for American families,\" said Matt Priest, CEO of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America.\n\nThe massive new import duties will hit footwear-producing nations such as Vietnam and China especially hard.\n\n\"Our industry is already dealing with inflationary pressures, and this move will force families to think twice before making a purchase,\" Priest said in a statement.\n\nThe tariffs will \"drive-up costs, reduce product quality, and weaken consumer confidence,\" he added.\n\nNearly 100% of all footwear is imported to the U.S., according to the group. About 37% of footwear imports came from China in 2023, followed by about 30% from Vietnam, nearly 9% from Italy and 8% from Indonesia, according to data from the U.S. International Trade Commission.\n\n- Melissa Repko\n\nPershing Square CEO Bill Ackman wrote on social media site X , \"Sometimes the best strategy in a negotiation is convincing the other side that you are crazy.\"\n\nAckman, who endorsed Trump in the 2024 election, is a frequent defender of the president on social media.\n\nHe argued in a prior X post Wednesday that other countries should not retaliate against the new U.S. tariffs.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nCiting a \"changing economy\" and its position as the No. 1 U.S. producer of cars and trucks, Ford said it is putting most of its vehicles on sale.\n\nThe automaker is offering employee pricing to all U.S. customers from April 3 to June 2.\n\nThe promotion excludes some large vehicles such as the Ford Raptor, the 2025 Expedition and Navigator SUVs and Super Duty trucks.\n\n\"We understand that these are uncertain times for many Americans,\" the company said in a statement. \"We have the retail inventory to do this and a lot of choice for customers that need a vehicle.\"\n\nU.S. auto sales in the first quarter came in higher than expected as consumers flocked to buy cars ahead of auto tariffs taking effect, which many expect will lead to higher vehicle prices.\n\n- Michele Luhn\n\nThe White House on Wednesday listed tariff rates for 180 countries that, in most cases, were roughly half of what the Trump administration claims each country has \"charged\" the U.S.\n\nIt didn't take long for market observers to try and reverse engineer the formula - to confusing results.\n\nMany observers said the U.S. appeared to have divided the trade deficit by imports from a given country to arrive at tariff rates for individual countries.\n\nSuch methodology does not necessarily align with the conventional approach to calculate tariffs and would imply the U.S. would have only looked at the trade deficit in goods and ignored trade in services.\n\nThe U.S. also appeared to have applied a 10% levy for regions where it is running a trade surplus.\n\nThe Office of the U.S. Trade Representative has since laid out its approach, including a formula, on its website that appeared somewhat similar to the online chatter, barring a few differences.\n\nRead the full story here .\n\n- Neelabh Chaturvedi, Asriel Chua\n\nTrump quickly declared his \"reciprocal\" tariff rollout a success.\n\n\"THE OPERATION IS OVER!\" Trump wrote in an all-caps Truth Social post .\n\n\"THE PATIENT LIVED, AND IS HEALING.

      "text": "Trump tariff fallout: Navarro downplays sell-off, while Musk slams his qualifications; tech and finance chiefs reportedly head to Mar-a-Lago\n\nThis was CNBC's coverage of how U.S. trade partners, industries and employers respond to President Donald Trump's historic tariffs.\n\nWhat you need to know:\n\nAmericans nearing retirement and recent retirees said they were anxious and frustrated following a second day of market turmoil that hit their 401(k)s, NBC News reported .\n\nSome said they are pausing big-ticket purchases and reconsidering home renovations, while others said they fear their quality of life will be adversely affected by all the turmoil.\n\n\"I'm just kind of stunned, and with so much money in the market, we just sort of have to hope we have enough time to recover,\" said Paula, 68, a former occupational health professional in New Jersey who retired three years ago.\n\nPaula, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because she feared retaliation for speaking out against Trump administration policies, said she was worried about what lies ahead.\n\n\"What we've been doing is trying to enjoy the time that we have, but you want to be able to make it last,\" Paula said Friday. \"I have no confidence here.\"\n\n- Daniella Silva of NBC News\n\nFrance could see a 0.5 percentage point reduction in gross domestic product growth as a result of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies, Prime Minister Francois Bayrou said in an interview on Saturday.\n\n\"Trump's policies could cost us more than 0.5% of our GDP,\" Bayrou said, according to excerpts published in an interview with Le Parisien newspaper.\n\n\"The imposition of these outrageous tariffs will lead to a global crisis (...). The risk of job losses is significant, as is that of an economic slowdown,\" he said.\n\nUnder Trump's plans announced on Wednesday, France will be subject to a general tariff of 20% along with other European Union countries.\n\nAfter speaking with Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer, President Emmanuel Macron said earlier on Saturday the two countries reaffirmed their determination to \"closely coordinate\" positions in tariff discussions with Trump.\n\n\"A trade war is in no one's interest. We must stand united and resolute to protect our citizens and our businesses,\" he said in post on X.\n\n- Reuters\n\nPresident Donald Trump may hope his tariffs jump-start a renaissance in manufacturing in the United States, but the reality is not so simple, according to experts.\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Chris Snyder said he thinks tariffs are a \"positive catalyst\" for reshoring but that he doesn't expect a massive wave of projects returning to the U.S. in the near term. Right now, he sees small, quick turnaround investments that could boost output by about 2%, he said.\n\nConsumer confidence has taken a hit - and that will be a factor in business' decisions on whether and when they will reshore, said Manish Kabra, Societe Generale's head of U.S. equity strategy.\n\nThere also needs to be a significant investment in training America's workforce, experts say.\n\n- Michelle Fox\n\nSilicon Valley's early return from the Trump administration so far in 2026 has been plunging valuations and delayed IPOs.\n\nThe leaders of Alphabet , Amazon , Meta , Microsoft and Uber all made big donations - either personally or through their companies - to Trump's second inauguration. Over the past two trading sessions, the seven most valuable U.S. tech companies lost a combined $1.8 trillion in market cap.\n\nWith Wall Street selling out of risky assets on concern that widespread tariff hikes will punish the U.S. and global economy, the fallout has drifted down to the IPO market. Online lender Klarna and ticketing marketplace StubHub delayed their IPOs due to market turbulence, just weeks after filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and fintech company Chime is also reportedly delaying its listing.\n\n- Ari Levy\n\nCNBC's Jim Cramer on Friday said next week's earnings reports will provide a first look at how CEOs are dealing with the fallout of Trump's tariff plan.\n\nBig bank earnings will kick off earnings season in the week ahead, and investors will also get to parse more inflation data.\n\nNo matter what the numbers reveal, however, Cramer said the market's direction will depend on Trump's next move. The tariff-driven market rout could end soon if Trump grants relief to trading partners, he said, or it could suddenly get worse as it did on Black Monday in 1987.\n\n\"If President Trump stays intransigent and does nothing to ameliorate the damage that I saw these last few days, I'm not going to be constructive here,\" Cramer said .\n\nEven if earnings do come in ahead of expectations, souring economic expectations due to tariffs have already punished their stocks and could continue to do so next week, Cramer said.\n\n\"Our only real hope is that the president comes up with something that can turn this bear into a bull,\" Cramer said.\n\n- Russell Leung\n\nWhere's Trump? The president is golfing today at his club in Jupiter, Florida, as the market continues to reel from his sweeping tariff announcement.\n\nThe president flew down to his home state of Florida on Thursday, one day after he announced his \" reciprocal tariffs .\" He took part in a \"LIV Dinner\" for the LIV Golf tour on Thursday night.\n\nOn Friday, he went to Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, before attending a fundraising dinner for a super PAC that backs Trump, MAGA Inc.\n\nTrump on Saturday is golfing at his course in Jupiter, where the senior club championships are taking place.\n\nThe White House said that Trump \"won his second round matchup of the Senior Club Championship ... and advances to the Championship Round tomorrow.\"\n\nDemocrats pounced on Trump's trip to Florida amid the fallout from his tariff announcement, taking to social media to criticize the president.\n\n\"Recession fears are rising. The stock market is tanking. But don't worry, Donald Trump is golfing,\" Democratic Rep. Jason Crow (Colorado) wrote on X.\n\n- Erin Doherty\n\nThe National Association of Wine Retailers said tariffs will have a material impact on the wine industry, resulting in significant revenue reductions, layoffs and business closings.\n\n\"We have every reason to believe that the recently enacted tariffs on wines imported from other countries, as well as tariffs on other goods, will result in a significant contraction of the wine market in the United States,\" the group said in a statement .\n\nThe association said the belief that wine drinkers will simply switch from European, South American, and Pacific nations' wines to domestically-made wines is false.\n\n\"It is a fundamental misunderstanding of wine drinkers and the wine marketplace to believe that wine is a fungible product. ... when an American wine drinker asks for Red Burgundy, they do not substitute Oregon Pinot Noir when the Burgundy is out of their price range or unavailable. They simply don't make a purchase,\" it said.\n\n- Yun Li\n\nElon Musk on Saturday said he wants a \"zero-tariff\" system between the U.S. and Europe that would effectively create \"a free trade zone,\" Bloomberg reported .\n\n\"Both Europe and the United States should move, ideally, in my view, to a zero-tariff situation,\" Musk told Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini on Saturday during a virtual event. \"That's what I hope occurs.\"\n\nSalvini thanked Musk for his appearance in an X post .\n\n- Annika Kim Constantino\n\nEconomists say that Trump's tariff formula is based on an underestimation of a key metric, which has resulted in inflated tariff rates for countries nationwide.\n\nAccording to the Office of the United States Trade Representative, the formula calculating Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariff plan is the country's trade deficit with the U.S., divided by its exports, then divided by two.\n\nBut that formula assumes an elasticity of import prices with respect to tariffs of about 0.25, but the economists say that that number should be closer to 1.0 (0.945), according to senior fellows Kevin Corinth and Stan Veuger at the American Enterprise Institute.\n\nIf Trump's formula reflected this, no country's tariff would exceed 14% and most would be at the 10% baseline established by the administration, according to AEI.\n\nFor instance, the tariff rate for Lesotho, the country with the highest rate, was 50%. But if adjusted, it would be 13.2%.\n\n- Erin Doherty\n\nA group of high-profile tech and finance leaders is making a trip to Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, to \"talk common sense\" to the president about his sweeping tariffs, several sources told veteran tech journalist Kara Swisher.\n\n\"Their million dollar donations to the inauguration is turning into billions and soon trillions in losses,\" Swisher said in a post on Threads, not indicating which leaders are part of the group.\n\nShe added that de facto DOGE chief and Tesla CEO Elon Musk is \"in their crosshairs too.\"\n\nTrump's tariffs sent global markets into a tailspin on Thursday and Friday, wiping out $30.9 billion in net worth for Musk, $23.49 billion for Amazon's Jeff Bezos and $27.34 billion for Meta's Mark Zuckerberg - the world's three richest people  - according to Bloomberg .\n\nThe tariffs are battering tech stocks due to the industry's heavy dependence on manufacturing, computer chips and IT services from countries like China, India and Taiwan.\n\n- Annika Kim Constantino\n\nElon Musk took aim at Peter Navarro, as the top Trump trade advisor continues to defend the president's sweeping tariffs.\n\n\"The market will find a bottom. It will be soon, and from there, we're going to have a bullish boom, and the Dow is going to hit 50,000 during Trump's term,\" Navarro said on CNN Saturday .\n\n\"A PhD in Econ from Harvard is a bad thing, not a good thing,\" Musk wrote in a post on X, responding to a post on the social media platform by a user touting Navarro's qualifications.\n\nMusk - whose DOGE team is engaged in a controversial effort to cut federal spending, including mass layoffs - also said that Navarro hasn't built \"s--t.\"\n\nThe billionaire SpaceX founder, who has been an influential voice during the early days of the Trump White House, may be leaving the administration in the coming months, NBC News reported this week .\n\n- Erin Doherty\n\nThe British maker of Jaguar and Land Rover cars is pausing shipments to the U.S. as it works to mitigate the impact of a 25% tax on vehicle imports imposed by the Trump Administration.\n\nJaguar Land Rover Automotive, one of Britain's biggest carmakers, said Saturday that the pause would take place this month.\n\n\"The USA is an important market for JLR's luxury brands,\" the company said in a statement. \"As we work to address the new trading terms with out business partners, we are taking some short-term actions including a shipment pause in April, as we develop our mid-to-longer term plans.\"\n\nThe U.K. automotive industry is expected to be hit hard by the new tariffs, which come at a time when British carmakers are struggling with declining demand at home and the need to retool their plants for the transition to electric vehicles.\n\n\"The industry is already facing multiple headwinds and this announcement comes at the worst possible time,\" Mike Hawes, chief executive of the U.K.'s Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said last week. \"SMMT is in constant contact with government and will be looking for trade discussions to accelerate as we need to secure a way forward that supports jobs and economic growth on both sides of the Atlantic.\"\n\nThe number of cars made in the U.K. dropped 13.9% to 779,584 vehicles last year, according to the SMMT. More than 77% of those vehicles were destined for the export market.\n\n- Reuters\n\nTop trade aide Peter Navarro downplayed the sharp market sell-off triggered by Trump's aggressive tariff rollout, vowing stocks will rebound and flourish soon.\n\n\"The market will find a bottom. It will be soon, and from there, we're going to have a bullish boom, and the Dow is going to hit 50,000 during Trump's term,\" he claimed on CNN Saturday. \"The S&P 500 is going to have a very broad based recovery, and wages are going to go up, profits are going to go up, and life is going to be beautiful here in America.\"\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2,231.07 points on Friday, the biggest decline since June 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic. This follows a 1,679-point decline on Thursday and marks the first time ever that it has shed more than 1,500 points on back-to-back days. The S&P 500 shed 10% in two days, now off more than 17% off its recent high.\n\n- Yun Li\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Saturday claimed that China has been \"hit much harder than the USA, not even close,\" in the escalating trade war.\n\n\"They, and many other nations, have treated us unsustainably badly,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social. \"We have been the dumb and helpless 'whipping post,' but not any longer.\"\n\nHe touted his sweeping new tariffs, saying, \"We are bringing back jobs and businesses like never before.\"\n\n\"Already, more than FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT, and rising fast! THIS IS AN ECONOMIC REVOLUTION, AND WE WILL WIN. HANG TOUGH, it won't be easy, but the end result will be historic. We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\" Trump wrote.\n\n- Annika Kim Constantino\n\nEli Lilly CEO David Ricks warned that Trump's decision to impose broad tariffs could ultimately hurt drug research and development in the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nTrump's reciprocal tariffs exempted pharmaceuticals imported to the U.S., bringing a temporary sigh of relief to drugmakers. But industry leaders are still bracing for Trump's plans to impose pharmaceutical-specific tariffs sometime soon.\n\n\"We can't breach those agreements, so we have to eat the cost of the tariffs and make trade-offs within our own companies,\" Ricks told BBC in an interview on Friday. \"Typically, that will be in reduction of staff or research and development, and I predict R&D will come first. That's a disappointing outcome.\"\n\nEli Lilly has led the industry in building up its U.S. production capabilities, earmarking $50 billion to construct and upgrade new plants since 2020. Those facilities are key to manufacturing the company's blockbuster weight loss and diabetes drugs.\n\nBut Eli Lilly also depends mainly on foreign manufacturing, most notably in Ireland, where it employs more than 3,000 and is constructing a new $800 million facility.\n\nRicks described the tariffs as a watershed moment in the nation's economic history.\n\n\"I think it's a pivot in U.S. policy and it feels like it'll be hard to come back from here,\" he said.\n\n- Annika Kim Constantino\n\nSome automakers are trying to capitalize on the moment amid the tariffs, industry analysts told CNBC . Ford and Stellantis are offering employee-pricing programs, while Hyundai Motor said it would not raise prices for at least two months to ease consumer concerns.\n\nAutomakers view the actions as a way to get vehicles off their lots and maintain or increase sales amid uncertain market conditions due to the tariffs.\n\n\"We understand that these are uncertain times for many Americans. Whether it's navigating the complexities of a changing economy or simply needing a reliable vehicle for your family, we want to help,\" Ford said in a statement Thursday morning announcing the program. \"We have the retail inventory to do this and a lot of choice for customers that need a vehicle.\"\n\n- Michael Wayland\n\nChina's Foreign Ministry on Saturday said \"the market has spoken\" following the U.S. imposition of sweeping new tariffs and called for the White House to defuse the escalating trade war through \"equal-footed consultation.\"\n\nU.S. stock markets fell sharply for a second consecutive day on Friday, with all three major indexes dropping by more than 5% as part of a global rout .\n\nSharing a picture of Friday's U.S. stock market downturn, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said, \"the trade and tariff war started by the U.S. against the world is unprovoked and unjustified.\"\n\n- Sam Meredith\n\nWith one of the nastiest two-day selloffs in history following President Donald Trump's launch of punitive tariffs on most trading partners, the stock market is in one of those precarious spots : Both tightly coiled for a near-term bounce soon, but not quite priced for the full fundamental implications of this policy as now contemplated.\n\nBespoke Investment Group gave voice to this uncomfortable moment, in which markets that are built to produce the \"wisdom of crowds\" through rational, collective price-setting are lashed to the whims a president channeling decades' worth of anti-trade feelings through the executive power to declare \"emergency\" tariffs.\n\n- Michael Santoli\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to visit the White House on Monday to discuss recently announced tariffs with Trump, three Israeli officials and a White House official said on Saturday.\n\nThe impromptu in-person visit could mark the first by a foreign leader to meet with Trump and try to negotiate a deal to remove tariffs.\n\nNetanyahu's office has not confirmed the visit, that would likely also include discussions on Iran and Israel's war against Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza. The visit was first reported by Axios.\n\nThe surprise invite by Trump came in a phone call on Thursday with Netanyahu, who is presently on a visit to Hungary, when the Israeli leader raised the tariff issue, according to the Israeli officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nAs part of a sweeping new tariff policy announced by Trump, unspecified Israeli goods exports to the United States face a 17% tariff. The U.S. is Israel's closest ally and largest single trading partner.\n\nAn Israeli finance ministry official said on Thursday that Trump's latest tariff announcement could impact Israel's exports of machinery and medical equipment.\n\nIsrael had already moved to cancel its remaining tariffs on U.S. imports on Tuesday. The two countries signed a free trade agreement 40 years ago and about 98% of goods from the U.S. are now tax-free.\n\n- Reuters\n\nBefore Wednesday, President Donald Trump's tariffs were expected to be a problem for markets and the economy, but a manageable one. What actually emerged, though, has been economic and geopolitical mayhem.\n\nIt started with Trump's Rose Garden news conference Wednesday after the market close, when the president slapped 10% tariffs on every U.S. trading partner starting Saturday, with individualized rates for 60 other countries that would begin in a week. Virtually overnight, the effective U.S. tariff rate was set to spring from 2.5% to well past 20%.\n\nChina retaliated with 34% tariffs on all goods, European Union leaders also are considering countermeasures.\n\nMarkets recoiled at the developments, sending stocks into a vicious two-day sell-off that put the Nasdaq Composite, home to powerhouse Silicon Valley names that Trump has been courting in the early days of his second term, into a bear market.\n\n- Jeff Cox\n\n- Terri Cullen\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Donald Trump, twice impeached and under FBI investigation, launches 2024 White House bid\n\nWASHINGTON - Former President Donald Trump announced Tuesday night that he was running for president in 2024, laying out an aggressively conservative agenda that includes executing people convicted of selling drugs.\n\nThe campaign will be Trump's third run for president, but his first time trying to win votes since his refusal to accept his 2020 election loss and his frantic effort to hold onto power led to the deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n\"We are a nation in decline. We are a failing nation for millions of Americans,\" Trump said in a speech at his private Florida club, attacking President Joe Biden's record in his first two years in office. \"I will ensure Joe Biden does not receive four more years.\"\n\nTrump filed papers with the Federal Election Commission earlier Tuesday night in which he declared himself a candidate for the presidency and established a new campaign committee.\n\n\"This campaign will be about issues, vision and success, and we will not stop, we will not quit, until we've achieved the highest goals and made our country greater than it has ever been before,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump barely mentioned the 2020 presidential race, nor did he bring up his two separate impeachments trials, the first for leveraging U.S. foreign aid in an effort to extort Ukraine into investigating the Biden family, and the second for his role in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.\n\nInstead of dwelling on his time in office, Trump's speech Tuesday echoed his 2016 campaign speeches in many ways, painting a dystopian picture of America as a failing nation ravaged by violent crime during \"a time of pain, hardship, anxiety and despair.\"\n\nTrump said the \"gravest threat to our civilization\" was what he called the weaponization of the Justice Department and the FBI, which is currently investigating his handling of classified documents and his role in a massive effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election results and prevent Congress from certifying Biden's victory.\n\nHe called for a \"top-to-bottom overhaul and clean out of the festering rot and corruption of Washington, D.C.\"\n\nTrump also said he would demand a sweeping new slate of election restrictions, including requiring only paper ballots, only allowing voters one day to vote, requiring photo ID in order to vote and \"all votes counted by election night.\"\n\n\"I'll get that job done,\" he said. \"That's a very personal job for me. I take that very personally.\"\n\nVoting in America is run by states, however, and not the federal government. Even if Trump were president and he had the backing of a Republican Congress, he could not change how individual states conduct elections.\n\nDuring the 2022 election cycle, Trump promoted and donated to a group of 2020 election denying candidates in battleground states who were running for positions overseeing their states' elections. The races were in Michigan, Arizona, Minnesota and Nevada, and every one of Trump's candidates lost.\n\nBy launching his campaign now, just a week after Republicans lost key midterm races, Trump was also rejecting the counsel of current and former advisors who had cautioned him against declaring himself a candidate for president so soon after a defeat for his party.\n\nTrump's filing with the F.E.C. created the Donald J. Trump for President 2024, and officially launched the 2024 Republican presidential primary, a contest where the dynamics have shifted dramatically in the past week.\n\nBefore last Tuesday, Trump, 76, was the undisputed frontrunner in his party's nominating contest, with polls showing the former president's support among Republican voters averaging more than 20 percentage points over his closest rival, Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nBut that was before DeSantis won reelection by an extraordinary 19-point margin, electrifying Republicans nationwide and offering the party a bright spot on a day when Democrats won most of the major Senate and governors' races.\n\nNow some of the early, post-election polling by YouGov shows DeSantis taking a lead over Trump.\n\nThe Florida governor has reportedly met with donors and started assembling his own presidential campaign to challenge Trump for the GOP nomination.\n\n\"I have only begun to fight,\" DeSantis promised supporters in his reelection victory speech.\n\nTrump's mounting legal problems will also be a factor in any coming primary and general election battles. His family real estate and hotel empire is facing a sweeping fraud lawsuit in New York state that could permanently cripple its operations and slash his personal wealth.\n\nTrump is also facing a probe in Georgia of his attempts to overturn the 2020 election results in the state.\n\nTrump's new status as a candidate are not expected to impact either the fraud suit or the Georgia case.\n\nBut now that Trump is officially Biden's political opponent in the 2024 election, Attorney General Merrick Garland will need to decide whether to appoint a special counsel to take over the daily management of the federal investigations into Trump.\n\nThe White House is keen to avoid any suggestion that the investigation and potential prosecution of the president's chief rival is politically motivated, or that it is designed in any way to damage Trump's 2024 election prospects.\n\nWhoever wins the Republican primary will likely face President Joe Biden . The president has yet to formally launch his reelection campaign, but plans for a campaign have reportedly solidified in recent weeks.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump accused Biden of mishandling the economy. \"In two years, the Biden administration has destroyed the U.S. economy. Destroyed,\" he said.\n\nThe prospect of a long primary between Trump and DeSantis would be great news for Democrats, in part because Democratic campaign strategists see DeSantis as a formidable challenger.\n\nBiden likes the idea, too. When a reporter asked him on Nov. 9 about Trump and DeSantis, the president said, \"It'll be fun watching them take on each other.\"\n\nDespite his setbacks, Trump remains the undisputed leader of the Republican party, and his loyal base of MAGA conservatives are also Republican primary voters, making him a serious contender right from the start.\n\nThis week, the Washington Post reported that Trump plans to build a campaign team that looks and feels more like the skeleton crew of loyal aides who ran his successful 2016 run, and less like the massive operation that his failed 2020 reelection bid grew into.\n\nTrump enters the race with more than $60 million in cash held by his leadership PAC, Save America, and a prodigious fundraising operation that vacuums up small-dollar donations at an unprecedented rate.\n\nFederal Election Commission rules prohibit Trump from using the leadership PAC money to directly finance his presidential campaign.\n\nBut in mid-October, Trump transferred $20 million from the leadership PAC to a newly created Super PAC called Make America Great Again Inc. At the time, Trump's team claimed the MAGA Inc. money would be spent to support midterm candidates, not to help Trump.\n\nYet campaign finance watchdogs raised alarms that the lion's share of the money could eventually find its way from MAGA Inc to Trump's presidential bid, effectively circumventing rules that prohibited Save America, but not MAGA Inc, from spending money on Trump's run for president.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Elon Musk may already be overstaying his welcome in Trump's orbit\n\nTech billionaire Elon Musk was handed a major win Tuesday evening when President-elect Donald Trump announced that the Tesla and SpaceX CEO would co-lead a new \"Department of Government Efficiency\" with Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nThe announcement reinforces the closeness that Musk appears to have has managed to achieve with Trump, even after the election. But for some people in Trump's orbit, Musk's presence has felt overbearing.\n\nMusk has been so aggressive in pushing his views about Trump's second term that he's stepping on the toes of Trump's transition team and may be overstaying his welcome at Mar-a-Lago, according to two people familiar with the transition who have spent time at the Palm Beach, Florida, resort over the past week.\n\nThe sources said that Musk's near-constant presence at Mar-a-Lago in the week since Election Day had begun to wear on people who've been in Trump's inner circle longer than the tech billionaire and who see him as overstepping his role in the transition. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they're not authorized to speak publicly.\n\n\"He's behaving as if he's a co-president and making sure everyone knows it,\" one of the people said of Musk.\n\n\"And he's sure taking lots of credit for the president's victory. Bragging about America PAC and X to anyone who will listen. He's trying to make President Trump feel indebted to him. And the president is indebted to no one,\" this person added.\n\nRead more from NBC News:\n\nMusk did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.\n\nIn a statement, Trump-Vance transition spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said, \"Elon Musk and President Trump are great friends and brilliant leaders working together to Make America Great Again. Elon Musk is a once in a generation business leader and our federal bureaucracy will certainly benefit from his ideas and efficiency.\"\n\nMusk traveled to Mar-a-Lago to watch the election returns come in last Tuesday night, and he's been there much of the past week, the two sources said. They said Musk is there at all hours, sitting with Trump and joining calls and meetings.\n\nMusk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has been involved in sensitive conversations, even before his role in the administration was announced, including briefly joining a phone call last week between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nAn adviser to Trump said that Elon Musk would join Trump in a meeting Wednesday with Republican lawmakers ahead of leadership elections.\n\nThe second person said that Musk has an \"opinion on and about everything,\" and that he shares them so forcefully that he's begun to pester Trump insiders.\n\n\"He wants to be seen as having say in everything (even if he doesn't),\" this source said.\n\nThe individual said that some Trump advisers said they were concerned that Musk didn't understand one key to being effective in Trump's world: keeping a low profile. Musk's engagement has been overly aggressive and may hurt his standing in the long run, the source said.\n\nThe second source also said that Musk appeared to be pushing his own agenda, instead of focusing on Trump's. They said that while Musk is clearly a smart and capable person, the transition is about ensuring those loyal to Trump will be the ones carrying out government policies.\n\n\"Appointing people because they are loyal to Elon doesn't work,\" the source said.\n\nMusk has been among Trump's most energetic supporters. His super PAC spent more than $152 million to elect Trump and other Republican candidates, with much of the money coming from Musk himself. He held rallies for Trump in battleground state Pennsylvania, offered $1 million daily giveaways for registered voters and turned his social media app X into a megaphone for Trump .\n\nIn posts on X in the past week, Musk has pushed various policy ideas including deporting immigrants and slashing government spending.\n\n\"Very productive day of work by the transition team,\" Musk posted Monday night, in a response to Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick, one of the two advisers leading the transition .\n\nMusk has also shared photos from Mar-a-Lago, including a photo with him and the extended Trump family. On Sunday, one of Trump's grandchildren, Kai Trump, posted a photo on X of herself with Musk, writing that Musk was \"achieving uncle status.\"\n\nMusk's private jet landed in West Palm Beach, near Mar-a-Lago, last Tuesday and was there for about 24 hours, according to the @ElonJet account on Bluesky that uses publicly available flight data. The plane took off from West Palm Beach last Wednesday and headed to Austin, Texas, where Musk has a home, but then it landed again in West Palm Beach on Friday and has been there for the four days since, according to the account. It's not clear whether Musk was on the jet for every flight.\n\nThe relationship between Musk and Trump has been rocky over the years, despite their recent alliance. Musk said in 2022 that Trump should \"hang up his hat & sail into the sunset,\" prompting Trump to hit back at the time that Musk would be \"worthless\" without government subsidies.\n\nThere's been intense speculation about the long-term viability of the relationship between Musk and Trump, given the ambitions and personalities of the two men, with many people on social media predicting an eventual falling-out between the two.\n\nBut Musk has already gained since the election in one respect: Tesla's share price has risen more than 15% from last Wednesday's opening price, outpacing the 1.8% growth in the S&P 500 over the same time period .\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Trump looks to America's past, not its future\n\nDonald Trump believes in yesterday.\n\nAs a candidate, he gazed back at past glory with his \"Make America Great Again\" slogan. As president, he pursues an unlikely quest to push back historical tides in the economy and other realms of American life.\n\nThe most recent example is Trump 's new tariffs, advanced to revive a shrunken steel industry. His rollback of environmental regulation seeks the same for the declining coal sector.\n\nHis pursuit of reduced immigration seeks to curb the number of foreign-born U.S. residents, which during his adult lifetime has swelled from 1 in 20 to 1 in 7. He likewise resists changes in gender relations, law enforcement, race and religion.\n\nThe president, who is 71, evinces little grasp of policy or philosophic conviction. But his impulses point in a clear direction: toward the very different America in which he came of age.\n\nTrump turned 25 in 1971, the year he became president of his family's real estate business. Eight in 10 Americans were white Christians then. The American economy represented nearly 40 percent of global output.\n\nManufacturing employed one-fourth of the labor force. In a job market dominated by men, factory work still offered the promise of a middle-class living for those with only a high school degree.\n\nMovements to protect women against domestic violence and sexual harassment had only begun to gain steam. Amid fears over rising crime, Clint Eastwood thrilled movie audiences as Dirty Harry, a tough-guy detective who disdained rules constraining police behavior.\n\nThe economic and cultural facts on the ground have changed dramatically since then. Trump's inclinations have not.\n\nStiffened international competition has sent the U.S. share of global output below 25 percent; manufacturing now employs fewer than 10 percent of American workers. Trump faults \"bad trade deals\" and seeks to renegotiate them.\n\nAs jobs in its trademark industry dwindled, the once-renowned \"Steel City\" of Pittsburgh has found new energy from service sectors such as education and health care. Unimpressed, Trump justified his tariffs before last month's special election outside Pittsburgh by insisting, \"If you don't have steel, you don't have a country.\"\n\nTrump complains that Canada, a potential tariff target, runs a trade surplus with the U.S. That's only true if the calculation excludes services - which now account for more than 80 percent of America's private sector jobs.\n\nWithdrawing from the Paris climate deal, Trump invoked his love for coal miners. But coal's contribution to electric power generation has fallen to 30 percent from 50 percent over the last half-century. Renewable energy businesses, which benefit from the shift away from fossil fuels, employ far more workers.\n\nWomen represent nearly half of today's labor force - but just one-third of Trump administration hires, according to an analysis by The Atlantic. Despite a sweeping societal shift in attitudes, Trump has reflexively defended prominent men accused of sexual misconduct or domestic violence such as his former White House staff secretary Rob Porter. He faces multiple allegations of misconduct himself.\n\nWith white Christians now an American minority, Trump declares \"Christmas is back\" under his administration. Following a decadeslong drop in crime rates, Trump publicly urges rougher police tactics. His Justice Department has abandoned initiatives to improve police-community relations.\n\nTrump rips athletes who protest law enforcement violence against blacks. He even mocks rules changes to protect football players which were made in response to mounting evidence that the game damages their brains.\n\nTrump's predilection for throwback attitudes is not uniform. Though he grew up during the peak of the Cold War, he demonstrates a striking desire to improve relations with Russia. Moscow's interference on his behalf in the 2016 election is now under investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller .\n\nOminously for fellow Republicans, the public response Trump evokes after 14 months in the White House tracks his penchant for nostalgia. His strongest support comes from older white Christians and whites without college educations, especially men - large but shrinking segments of the electorate.\n\nHis strongest opposition comes from growing segments: nonwhites; college graduates, especially women; and millennials, the most racially and religiously diverse of American generations. Trump's candidate in that Pittsburgh-area special election lost - despite the steel tariffs and Trump's landslide 2016 win in the district.\n\nA quarter century ago, Bill Clinton broke the GOP's grip on the presidency by modernizing the Democratic message to focus on the future. It was the polar opposite of Trump's approach.\n\nClinton's theme song in 1992 implored voters: \"Don't stop thinking about tomorrow.\" Democrats have won the popular vote in six of seven presidential elections since.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Protectionism won't make America great\n\nThe Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) sent a report to Congress this summer detailing the Trump administration's trade enforcement priorities. Heading the list is \"aggressive defense of U.S. trade remedies laws.\" This means actively seeking to restrict imports.\n\nThe report proclaims that \"enforcement actions undertaken by USTR will be designed to increase our economic growth, promote job creation in the United States, . . . [and] strengthen our manufacturing base.\"\n\nThat statement flies in the face of economic reality.\n\nEconomists from both the left and the right of the political spectrum have agreed for decades that a country always will lower its own economic welfare whenever it imposes import restrictions . This means the nation's overall level of prosperity and living standards will fall, not rise.\n\nThe Trump administration's efforts to tighten import restrictions on behalf of favored industries will harm economic growth, lead to lower employment, and increase costs to consumers. Not exactly a strategy to make America great again.\n\nUSTR argues that trade remedy laws \"have been a critical aspect of the bargain between the U.S. government and American workers, farmers, ranchers, and businesses (large and small) that has long supported this country's free and fair trade system.\" It's not clear that there ever was such a bargain. USTR is expressing a common fallacy - that combative use of such measures will help to build support among U.S. citizens on behalf of free trade.\n\nPublic support for free trade has dwindled as the United States has imposed more and more import restrictions. Protectionism begets more protectionism, not more trade liberalization.\n\nOver 400 trade-remedy restrictions now are in place on a wide range of products from more than 40 countries. It is a weak argument, indeed, to suggest that imposing a few more tariffs will make Americans more confident of their ability to succeed and prosper in an open global marketplace.\n\nThe Trump administration's rationale for pursuing enforcement of trade restrictions is that some imports are sold at prices the Department of Commerce (DOC) has determined to be unfairly low. The law allows the government to step in and place duties on those imports so they can only be sold at prices the government deems to be fair.\n\nAs might be imagined, the government isn't very good at achieving fairness in the marketplace. It doesn't even try to balance the interests of producers and consumers. This law considers only the producers' interests - consumers are left to fend for themselves. This may not seem like such a big deal, if it just means the price of imported tomatoes goes up a few cents per pound. Consumers either will choose to pay the price, or perhaps will buy cucumbers instead.\n\nBut what if the restricted product is hot-rolled steel, and the buyer paying the artificially high price is a manufacturer of washing machines struggling to compete with imported washers? U.S. steel prices already are well above those in other major countries. How can U.S. factories succeed in the marketplace against foreign firms that have access to world-price steel?\n\nSince half of America's imports are used as inputs by manufacturers, it isn't surprising that many companies see these duties as being quite unfair and burdensome. It certainly can be hard to run a competitive manufacturing business when U.S. policies are giving an advantage to foreign companies.\n\nRather than pursuing protectionism, the government should develop a better set of trade priorities. Here are some suggestions:\n\nFirst, help to increase public understanding of trade economics. For example, USTR could explain counterintuitive concepts, including the idea that even unfairly priced imports are beneficial to the U.S. economy. Consumers are helped more by imports than producers are hurt. The implication for trade policy is obvious: The United States would be better off if it simply ended all of its trade restrictions unilaterally.\n\nSecond, give higher priority to adjustment assistance. Companies and workers dealing with overseas competition can be eligible for transitional assistance to overcome import challenges. The administration should consider upgrading assistance for firms to encourage them to increase their competitiveness through restructuring or adopting best practices. Since no government can bring factory jobs back to every town, workers should be empowered to find new employment through a combination of education, retraining, and relocation assistance.\n\nThird, reform U.S. trade remedy laws . These statues are severely flawed. They should be changed so that import restrictions only could be imposed after there has been a finding that doing so will increase economic welfare. It makes no sense to implement policies that make the American economy weaker.\n\nFourth, have more faith in o pen and competitive markets. They provide greater opportunities for people to earn good livings, to invest, and to pursue their dreams. Capitalism spurs economic growth; government protection for favored industries slows it down. Instead of imposing new import restrictions, the Trump administration should strive to expand economic freedom for all Americans.\n\nDan Pearson is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, and served as chairman of the U.S. International Trade Commission during the George W. Bush administration.\n\nFor more insight from CNBC contributors, follow @CNBCopinion on Twitter.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Trump targets adversaries in his final pitch, while Biden focuses on Covid-19\n\nWASHINGTON - For President Donald Trump's campaign, election eve this year looks, in many ways, a lot like it did four years ago.\n\nOn that Monday, Nov. 7, 2016, Trump barnstormed through five states, Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Michigan, where thousands of red-hatted supporters stood in line for hours to wave Make America Great Again signs.\n\nOn Monday, Trump again held rallies in North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, then was set to hold two rallies Monday night in Michigan.\n\nBut while the photos look similar and the signs haven't changed, Trump's closing pitch to voters this year bears little resemblance to the final stump speeches of his first successful campaign for president.\n\nThe economic populism that fueled Trump's meteoric rise to the presidency is all but gone this time around. His speeches contain barely any mention of the issues that won over voters in 2016: Bringing back manufacturing jobs, cutting taxes, striking better trade deals and ending foreign wars.\n\nInstead, Trump's closing argument this year amounts to a laundry list of his personal grievances against government agencies, courts, voting laws, individual journalists and TV hosts, pollsters, tech companies, medical experts and so on.\n\nAt his rallies on Monday afternoon, Trump drew up an enemies list that included the Supreme Court, CNN, Fox News polling, Twitter, the experts running the FDA's vaccine approval process, former special counsel Robert Mueller and people who don't give him credit for all the coronavirus pandemic deaths he claims America avoided because of federal actions.\n\nTrailing in the polls, Trump has leaned into his tendency to portray himself as a victim, expanding what used to be short riffs within his standard stump speeches so that now they occupy large swaths of his speech.\n\n\"The only way to convince people that you're not a loser is to convince them that you're a victim,\" Amanda Carpenter, a former communications director for GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, recently told The New York Times. \"Having something be rigged against him is the ultimate ego protector, because he never has to admit that he lost.\"\n\nCNBC reached out to the Trump campaign about the increasingly personal tone of Trump's stump speech, but they did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe other piece of Trump's closing argument, his attacks on Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, are growing increasingly apocalyptic. He told supporters in Pennsylvania that Biden \"will totally destroy Pennsylvania\" and that he will turn America into Venezuela.\n\n\"Joe Biden is a globalist who spent 47 years outsourcing your jobs, opening your borders and sacrificing American blood and treasure on ridiculous, endless foreign wars most of you have never even heard of,\" Trump said.\n\nWhile polls show Biden leading both nationally and across many of the key swing states, surveys have shown the race tightening this week, as Trump has embarked upon a frenetic daily schedule of up to five rallies a day. The rallies have drawn huge crowds, reminiscent of 2016, irrespective of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic that has upended American life.\n\nBut while the pandemic seemed like an afterthought at Trump's packed and largely mask-free rallies on Monday, for Biden it was front and center.\n\nThe former vice president's final day of campaigning included stops in Ohio and then Pennsylvania, where he delivered a message that has changed very little in the past three months.\n\nThe central point of Biden's 11th-hour pitch to voters remains that Trump has not and will not take the necessary steps to control the coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed more than 230,000 American lives this year.\n\n\"Donald Trump waved the white flag of surrender to this virus,\" Biden said at a campaign stop in Cleveland on Monday. \"I'm never gonna  raise the white flag of surrender. We're gonna beat this virus, and we're gonna get it under control, I promise you. But the first step to beating the virus is beating Donald Trump.\"\n\nBiden also emphasized national unity and an end to the hyper-partisanship that has characterized much of Trump's time in office.\n\n\"The only thing that can tear America apart is America itself,\" Biden said in Mocana, Pennsylvania, during the second leg of his travel Monday. \"That's exactly what Donald Trump has been doing from the beginning of his campaign: Dividing America. Pitting Americans against one another based on race, gender, ethnicity, national origin. That's wrong. That's not who we are.\"\n\nBiden also made another pitch to a key group of voters whose defection from the Democratic Party in 2016 is widely seen as the biggest single factor in Trump's victory: White, working-class voters in the Midwest.\n\nAnd as Trump has dropped many of his most populist economic messages, Biden has added them to his own pitch, part of a clear effort to win back the 2016 defectors.\n\n\"I grew up around guys like Donald Trump,\" Biden said Monday in Cleveland. \"I grew up in neighborhoods like probably many of you did, working-class neighborhoods, where most people didn't have a college education. But we had guys like Trump that we used to play against when we played ball ... and because they had more money and we didn't, they would look down their noses on us.\"\n\nBut on the eve of Election Day , the question of whether or not Biden and the Democrats can win back these middle-class, economy-focused voters is still very much up in the air.\n\nPolling averages show Biden in a dead heat with Trump in Ohio, leading by around 5 points in Pennsylvania and leading by more than 5 points in Michigan.\n\nAll three states are viewed by both the Biden and Trump campaigns as crucial contests.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "How I'd Make America Great Again\n\nBy Adam Ozimek\n\nBy Adam Ozimek ,\n\nFormer Contributor.\n\nA supporter shows a Donald Trump hat before a campaign rally, Saturday, March 5, 2016, in Orlando, ... [+] Fla. (AP Photo/Brynn Anderson)\n\nAs the Trump administration sputters and his plan to Make America Great Again looks like it's going nowhere, I thought I might offer a very brief summary of how I'd Make America Great Again if I was put in charge (and not allowed to refuse the job, which I would try to do). As a warning, this post is mostly a list and not really a defense. So I'm not going to explain in detail why all these policies are the best, I'm just stating that they are. I'll leave it to you to debate the goodness versus badness.\n\nImmigration\n\nFirst, and perhaps most contentious, immigration. I would offer an amnesty with no path to citizenship for existing undocumented immigrants. Next, I would significantly increase legal immigrant flows. Probably to around 4 million a year up from just below 1 million recently. I would use city-based visas to try to help places struggling with population loss become gateways for skilled immigrant communities. Immigrants tend to locate in places in the U.S. where other immigrants from their country of origin have previously located, so there should be some momentum in this policy that builds over time. I would focus on increasing high skilled immigration, but would also expand and reform guest worker visas to accomodate the clear demand and supply of seasonal immigrant workers in some places and industries.\n\nTax & Labor Market Policy\n\nI would enact a carbon tax and use that to fund a very very large expansion in the Earned Income Tax Credit and some sort of child tax credit. I'd also set the federal minimum wage to zero. Yes, I would do that.\n\nThere are a few areas where we have big policy issues but need more research. I'd focus on trying to learn more here, and elevate the issues as urgent. High on this list is that I would fund a significant research program, conference, and national discussion on the economics of greater equalization of labor and capital taxation. This could go a long way towards encouraging work, and I'm not sure there is sufficient justification for the preferential tax treatment that capital gets. But I'm not ready yet to pull the trigger on this, so let's just start with a debate.\n\nWe could raise a lot of money and in a pretty efficient way by instituting a federal property tax on luxury homes . That's a hard lift I understand, but it should be done.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nMore infrastructure spending appears needed, but just as importantly reform is needed. Short and immediate steps include Davis-Bacon is gone, and Tiger grants are expanded. These things we can do now. But on the research agenda is that we need to develop best practices for state and local public transportation spending because the infrastructure costs in this country are an absolute mess compared to the rest of the developed world, and we shouldn't be giving any federal funding to places that waste a ridiculous amount of money unless they agree to embrace best practices and work on reform.\n\nIn addition, the government is doing some work on autonomous driving, but car crash related deaths are a big problem and the potential productivity gains here are massive. What's more there is a crucial role for the government to play. Multiple cities should be chosen for massive federal grants to try to change their infrastructure to adapt to self-driving cars. Options to explore include machine readable lights, signals, and maybe even road lines. When road repairs, major accidents, or other traffic changes happen the government should automatically and quickly upload this info to mapping software. Make this a competitive bid process, which will get cities thinking about how to do this best and will by itself generate important insights. Choosing multiple cities will help ensure experimentation to see what works best, and cities will be encouraged to partner with tech companies as part of the competitive application process.\n\nEducation\n\nThe federal government has limited ability to make changes for k-12, but more cities need more charters. Not sure there is much to do there federally, but another Race to the Top should be explored.\n\nUniversities generate significant economic development spillovers in places where access to quality higher education is limited. Distance from home is also a very important factor that people use in deciding which schools to attend and whether to attend at all. So I'd give states money to create more high quality state universities in struggling areas, perhaps through additional campuses for existing successful schools. This would be tied to a program that aggressively courts international students to these schools and makes it easy for them to stay here when they graduate. This ensures there is ample demand and also helps to seed immigrant communities to these struggling places.\n\nHealthcare\n\nI am perhaps least certain here. But I'd probably allow low income people above current cutoffs the opportunity to buy into Medicaid. Medicaid is cheap, and when Republicans who don't like it complain that doctors hate which makes it hard to find doctors who will accept it they are actually making an excellent case for it. If doctors loved Medicaid and all doctors accepted it, it would be a sign it is too generous. The right of healthcare is the right to not be financially ruined by diseases you could do little to prevent. It should not be about having the exact healthcare coverage you want, complete with luxurious service and treatment that we as consumers prefer.\n\nI would also end the employer mandate and stop delaying the Cadillac tax.\n\nBold Thinking At the Fed\n\nThe Fed needs to be willing to try some bold new ideas, like allowing the economy run hot after a recession and saying out loud that 3% inflation for a while might be a good thing. I don't know who this is. But I'd ask Larry Summers, Narayana Kocherlakota, Greg Mankiw and others behind closed doors what their plans are to reduce the risk of ZLB in the next recession and put in someone willing to take bold moves who also seemed willing to take the heat from doing this. John Taylor would not be on the list.\n\nIn short\n\nHere's a few other quick last things: much more spending on basic research grants, reform the patent process, name and shame communities with high degrees of segregation and restrictive zoning, the BLS needs to measure owner occupied housing correctly in the CPI , reform and lower corporate taxes, and we need more randomized major economic policy experiments with significant long-term federal funding.\n\nIf we did all of these things, America would be Great Again."

      "text": "What Is Trump Trying To Accomplish With Tariffs?\n\nBy Adam A. Millsap\n\nBy Adam A. Millsap ,\n\nContributor.\n\nRACINE, WISCONSIN - JUNE 18: Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump arrives ... More for a rally at Festival Park on June 18, 2024 in Racine, Wisconsin. This is Trump's third visit to Wisconsin, a key swing state in 2024.  (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nIt is no secrete president-elect Donald Trump is a fan of tariffs. He calls himself the tariff man and he portrays tariffs as a cure-all that can deter war, boost American manufacturing, protect jobs, and raise hundreds of billions of dollars to pay for childcare and tax cuts. Tariffs can impact these goals (though not without creating other problems ), but there is no way tariffs can accomplish them all simultaneously.\n\nAt the most basic level tariffs are taxes on imports. But who pays the tariff tax? Proponents of tariffs, such as Trump and some of his advisers, claim that foreign countries pay for tariffs , primarily in the form of lower prices for the things they sell to Americans. Others counter that tariffs are just added to the price of imports, so it is Americans who pay.\n\nThe reality is a bit more nuanced and depends on a variety of factors, but most of the research examining current tariffs imposed on China and other countries finds that American consumers and importers bear most of the burden. For some products, such as optical instruments, the entire amount of the tariff is passed on to Americans in the form of higher prices. If Trump imposes his new tariffs, American consumers will be paying the bulk of the tariff tax.\n\nNot all consumers will pay equally, though. Some states import more goods than others, and all else equal consumers who import more will pay more tariffs. A recent analysis from the Tax Policy Center finds that Kentucky's residents would experience the biggest increase in tariff payments as a share of state GDP if Trump follows through on his plan for a 60% tariff on Chinese imports and a 10% tariff on all other imports. Kentucky's tariff payments would increase from 0.6% of state GDP to 4.7% of state GDP, or $1.7 billion to $13.1 billion using 2023 state GDP (see figure below). This increase is equal to an additional $2,887 for every man, woman, and child in the state.\n\nCurrent Tariffs vs. Trump Proposal\n\nNow that we know who will pay for any new tariffs, let us examine Trump's goals. To deter war, Trump says he will threaten to impose tariffs of 100% on countries who attack or threaten us or our allies. The unstated assumption is that a 100% tariff would hurt the offending country's economy by reducing its exports to America, and that this economic harm would deter any aggression.\n\nFor this to work, our imports of that country's products would have to fall dramatically or that country would have to absorb most of the tariff by lowering the prices of its exports so they remain competitive with similar products. The latter is unlikely since the research shows most of the time countries pass on the higher prices to U.S. consumers. This means the economic harm to the other country would have to come from fewer exports due to the higher prices. But if exports fall enough to meaningfully harm the other country's economy and deter armed conflict, the tariffs will not raise much revenue.\n\nThis is the tradeoff confronting proponents of tariffs: Modest tariffs can raise some revenue to pay for other things like income tax cuts or childcare, while much higher tariffs are needed to dramatically deter imports and cause significant harm to other countries' economies. Achieving both goals simultaneously is unrealistic.\n\nTake another one of Trump's goals, boosting American manufacturing. Again, this only works if imports become more expensive than similar domestic products, which would shift demand from imports to American-made products. The more expensive imports get relative to domestic products, the less Americans buy from abroad and the more they make at home, which reduces tariff revenue. In the extreme case of completely decoupling from China, a goal of Trump's former U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer, Trump's proposed 60% tariffs on Chinese imports would raise no money. So, like deterring war, the goal of significantly boosting American manufacturing is inconsistent with raising a lot of tariff revenue to pay for other things.\n\nThe tradeoff between using tariffs to boost domestic production and raise revenue is something policymakers have grappled with for centuries. In a recent paper in the Journal of Economic Perspectives, New York University professor emeritus Richard Sylla argues that Alexander Hamilton, who is celebrated by today's pro-tariff crowd, was acutely aware of this tradeoff. As a result, he disliked tariffs that drastically decreased trade. Hamilton had big plans for the federal government, including funding infrastructure projects and paying off states' Revolutionary War debts, and this required federal tax revenue, the bulk of which came from tariffs. He knew setting tariffs too high would undermine his other goals.\n\nDespite Trump's claims, tariffs will not make America great again. Dozens of studies find that universal tariffs would decrease GDP growth, especially if other countries retaliate with their own tariffs. Instead of tariffs, Trump should focus on his other campaign promises -pro-growth tax reforms that encourage innovation and regulatory reforms that unleash energy production and new construction."

      "text": "How I'd Make America Great Again\n\nBy Adam Ozimek\n\nBy Adam Ozimek ,\n\nFormer Contributor.\n\nA supporter shows a Donald Trump hat before a campaign rally, Saturday, March 5, 2016, in Orlando, ... [+] Fla. (AP Photo/Brynn Anderson)\n\nAs the Trump administration sputters and his plan to Make America Great Again looks like it's going nowhere, I thought I might offer a very brief summary of how I'd Make America Great Again if I was put in charge (and not allowed to refuse the job, which I would try to do). As a warning, this post is mostly a list and not really a defense. So I'm not going to explain in detail why all these policies are the best, I'm just stating that they are. I'll leave it to you to debate the goodness versus badness.\n\nImmigration\n\nFirst, and perhaps most contentious, immigration. I would offer an amnesty with no path to citizenship for existing undocumented immigrants. Next, I would significantly increase legal immigrant flows. Probably to around 4 million a year up from just below 1 million recently. I would use city-based visas to try to help places struggling with population loss become gateways for skilled immigrant communities. Immigrants tend to locate in places in the U.S. where other immigrants from their country of origin have previously located, so there should be some momentum in this policy that builds over time. I would focus on increasing high skilled immigration, but would also expand and reform guest worker visas to accomodate the clear demand and supply of seasonal immigrant workers in some places and industries.\n\nTax & Labor Market Policy\n\nI would enact a carbon tax and use that to fund a very very large expansion in the Earned Income Tax Credit and some sort of child tax credit. I'd also set the federal minimum wage to zero. Yes, I would do that.\n\nThere are a few areas where we have big policy issues but need more research. I'd focus on trying to learn more here, and elevate the issues as urgent. High on this list is that I would fund a significant research program, conference, and national discussion on the economics of greater equalization of labor and capital taxation. This could go a long way towards encouraging work, and I'm not sure there is sufficient justification for the preferential tax treatment that capital gets. But I'm not ready yet to pull the trigger on this, so let's just start with a debate.\n\nWe could raise a lot of money and in a pretty efficient way by instituting a federal property tax on luxury homes . That's a hard lift I understand, but it should be done.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nMore infrastructure spending appears needed, but just as importantly reform is needed. Short and immediate steps include Davis-Bacon is gone, and Tiger grants are expanded. These things we can do now. But on the research agenda is that we need to develop best practices for state and local public transportation spending because the infrastructure costs in this country are an absolute mess compared to the rest of the developed world, and we shouldn't be giving any federal funding to places that waste a ridiculous amount of money unless they agree to embrace best practices and work on reform.\n\nIn addition, the government is doing some work on autonomous driving, but car crash related deaths are a big problem and the potential productivity gains here are massive. What's more there is a crucial role for the government to play. Multiple cities should be chosen for massive federal grants to try to change their infrastructure to adapt to self-driving cars. Options to explore include machine readable lights, signals, and maybe even road lines. When road repairs, major accidents, or other traffic changes happen the government should automatically and quickly upload this info to mapping software. Make this a competitive bid process, which will get cities thinking about how to do this best and will by itself generate important insights. Choosing multiple cities will help ensure experimentation to see what works best, and cities will be encouraged to partner with tech companies as part of the competitive application process.\n\nEducation\n\nThe federal government has limited ability to make changes for k-12, but more cities need more charters. Not sure there is much to do there federally, but another Race to the Top should be explored.\n\nUniversities generate significant economic development spillovers in places where access to quality higher education is limited. Distance from home is also a very important factor that people use in deciding which schools to attend and whether to attend at all. So I'd give states money to create more high quality state universities in struggling areas, perhaps through additional campuses for existing successful schools. This would be tied to a program that aggressively courts international students to these schools and makes it easy for them to stay here when they graduate. This ensures there is ample demand and also helps to seed immigrant communities to these struggling places.\n\nHealthcare\n\nI am perhaps least certain here. But I'd probably allow low income people above current cutoffs the opportunity to buy into Medicaid. Medicaid is cheap, and when Republicans who don't like it complain that doctors hate which makes it hard to find doctors who will accept it they are actually making an excellent case for it. If doctors loved Medicaid and all doctors accepted it, it would be a sign it is too generous. The right of healthcare is the right to not be financially ruined by diseases you could do little to prevent. It should not be about having the exact healthcare coverage you want, complete with luxurious service and treatment that we as consumers prefer.\n\nI would also end the employer mandate and stop delaying the Cadillac tax.\n\nBold Thinking At the Fed\n\nThe Fed needs to be willing to try some bold new ideas, like allowing the economy run hot after a recession and saying out loud that 3% inflation for a while might be a good thing. I don't know who this is. But I'd ask Larry Summers, Narayana Kocherlakota, Greg Mankiw and others behind closed doors what their plans are to reduce the risk of ZLB in the next recession and put in someone willing to take bold moves who also seemed willing to take the heat from doing this. John Taylor would not be on the list.\n\nIn short\n\nHere's a few other quick last things: much more spending on basic research grants, reform the patent process, name and shame communities with high degrees of segregation and restrictive zoning, the BLS needs to measure owner occupied housing correctly in the CPI , reform and lower corporate taxes, and we need more randomized major economic policy experiments with significant long-term federal funding.\n\nIf we did all of these things, America would be Great Again."

      "text": "Why Liberals See Trump As Racist And Sexist While Conservatives Don't\n\nBy Jessi Streib\n\nBy Jessi Streib ,\n\nContributor.\n\nDonald Trump in a Make America Great Again hat\n\nThe recent presidential election resurfaced questions Democrats asked eight years ago: how can so many Americans vote for Donald Trump given his racism and sexism?\n\nWe were curious about this as well, and so we set out to study it. As the conversation around the last election centered on white liberals and white conservatives, we focused our attention on these groups.\n\nUnsurprisingly, white liberals and white conservatives tend to see different individuals, interactions, and institutions as racist and sexist. More revealingly, their difference relates to their definitions of racism and sexism and how they determine whether they occurred.\n\nWhite liberals tend to use broad definitions of racism and sexism. To them, racism and sexism involve mistreating someone due to their race or gender, intentionally or not, as well as unequal outcomes between people of different races and genders. Under this definition, Trump does plenty of things that are racist and sexist. The Muslim ban mainly targets people of one race, and so they deem it racist. His alleged sexual assaults target people of one gender, and so they consider it sexist too.\n\nWhite liberals tend to determine whether their definitions have been met using algorithmic methods. Just as an algorithm can be trained to identify each case that matches a pattern, liberals know many ways that people of color and women are mistreated and call any case that fits that pattern 'racist' and 'sexist.' They do so without gathering evidence about the particular case or considering alternative explanations of what happened. They also assume that most bad things that happen to people of color and women wouldn't have happened to white people or men, and use that presumption as evidence of racism and sexism. When they are in doubt, which they aren't often, they give the benefit of the doubt to the person who accused others of racism and sexism. After all, they reason that racism and sexism happen all the time. It likely happened this time, too.\n\nUsing this lens, they see much of what Trump says and does as racist and sexist. To them, the border wall is racist; Trump doesn't propose a wall along the northern border, too, where more white people live. His comment against the football player and activist Colin Kaepernick ('get that son of a bitch off the field') was racist; he never would have said that to a white player. His comments about Baltimore being rat-infested and Haiti being a shithole were racist; they matched the ways people disparage where Black people live. His support of Kavanaugh was sexist; women often aren't believed that they were sexually assaulted, and Trump fit that pattern. Trump's support for overturning Roe was sexist as well; it negatively affected women.\n\nBut while it's obvious to many white liberals that Trump is racist and sexist, it's not obvious to many white conservatives. They use different definitions and methods and reach different conclusions.\n\nTo many white conservatives, racism and sexism are defined by the intent to mistreat a person due to their race or gender. If a white person hurts a person of color but not because of their race, it's not racist. Likewise, if a man hurts a woman but not because of her gender, it's not sexist. To many conservatives, then, the Muslim ban is not racist; it is about religion and not race. Along the same lines, Trump's alleged sexual assaults are not sexist. He is attracted to women, so that's who he assaulted, but had he been attracted to men, he might have assaulted them. What he did was wrong, many white conservatives say, but it wasn't sexist.\n\nWhite conservatives tend to use their own logic to judge and justify whether something is racist or sexist. They take an i nvestigative approach. Acting like detectives, they dig into the details of the case and try to discern exactly what happened. Who said what, when, and where? What is the accused's history with people of a particular race and gender? They consider alternative explanations: could this have happened for reasons besides racism or sexism? They also make the opposite assumption as liberals; they assume most things could have happened to white people and men. When they lack the evidence they want, which is often, they give the benefit of the doubt to the accused. We live in a country where people are innocent until proven guilty. To them, that's what we should do regarding racism and sexism, too.\n\nUsing this approach, they argue that much of what Trump says and does is not racist or sexist. His comments about Colin Kaepernick were about disrespecting the flag, not about race. Besides, Trump would have said the same to white people who disrespected the flag too. Calling Baltimore rat-infested and Haiti a shithole isn't racism; he was just telling the truth that there are rats in Baltimore and outdoor bathrooms in Haiti. Supporting Kavanaugh's nomination for the Supreme Court wasn't sexist; there may very well be a pattern of men assaulting women, but that doesn't mean it happened in this case.\n\nSo how can so many Americans vote for Trump, given his racism and sexism? Easy, it's because many don't think he displays either one."

      "text": "What Is Trump Trying To Accomplish With Tariffs?\n\nBy Adam A. Millsap\n\nBy Adam A. Millsap ,\n\nContributor.\n\nRACINE, WISCONSIN - JUNE 18: Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump arrives ... More for a rally at Festival Park on June 18, 2024 in Racine, Wisconsin. This is Trump's third visit to Wisconsin, a key swing state in 2024.  (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nIt is no secrete president-elect Donald Trump is a fan of tariffs. He calls himself the tariff man and he portrays tariffs as a cure-all that can deter war, boost American manufacturing, protect jobs, and raise hundreds of billions of dollars to pay for childcare and tax cuts. Tariffs can impact these goals (though not without creating other problems ), but there is no way tariffs can accomplish them all simultaneously.\n\nAt the most basic level tariffs are taxes on imports. But who pays the tariff tax? Proponents of tariffs, such as Trump and some of his advisers, claim that foreign countries pay for tariffs , primarily in the form of lower prices for the things they sell to Americans. Others counter that tariffs are just added to the price of imports, so it is Americans who pay.\n\nThe reality is a bit more nuanced and depends on a variety of factors, but most of the research examining current tariffs imposed on China and other countries finds that American consumers and importers bear most of the burden. For some products, such as optical instruments, the entire amount of the tariff is passed on to Americans in the form of higher prices. If Trump imposes his new tariffs, American consumers will be paying the bulk of the tariff tax.\n\nNot all consumers will pay equally, though. Some states import more goods than others, and all else equal consumers who import more will pay more tariffs. A recent analysis from the Tax Policy Center finds that Kentucky's residents would experience the biggest increase in tariff payments as a share of state GDP if Trump follows through on his plan for a 60% tariff on Chinese imports and a 10% tariff on all other imports. Kentucky's tariff payments would increase from 0.6% of state GDP to 4.7% of state GDP, or $1.7 billion to $13.1 billion using 2023 state GDP (see figure below). This increase is equal to an additional $2,887 for every man, woman, and child in the state.\n\nCurrent Tariffs vs. Trump Proposal\n\nNow that we know who will pay for any new tariffs, let us examine Trump's goals. To deter war, Trump says he will threaten to impose tariffs of 100% on countries who attack or threaten us or our allies. The unstated assumption is that a 100% tariff would hurt the offending country's economy by reducing its exports to America, and that this economic harm would deter any aggression.\n\nFor this to work, our imports of that country's products would have to fall dramatically or that country would have to absorb most of the tariff by lowering the prices of its exports so they remain competitive with similar products. The latter is unlikely since the research shows most of the time countries pass on the higher prices to U.S. consumers. This means the economic harm to the other country would have to come from fewer exports due to the higher prices. But if exports fall enough to meaningfully harm the other country's economy and deter armed conflict, the tariffs will not raise much revenue.\n\nThis is the tradeoff confronting proponents of tariffs: Modest tariffs can raise some revenue to pay for other things like income tax cuts or childcare, while much higher tariffs are needed to dramatically deter imports and cause significant harm to other countries' economies. Achieving both goals simultaneously is unrealistic.\n\nTake another one of Trump's goals, boosting American manufacturing. Again, this only works if imports become more expensive than similar domestic products, which would shift demand from imports to American-made products. The more expensive imports get relative to domestic products, the less Americans buy from abroad and the more they make at home, which reduces tariff revenue. In the extreme case of completely decoupling from China, a goal of Trump's former U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer, Trump's proposed 60% tariffs on Chinese imports would raise no money. So, like deterring war, the goal of significantly boosting American manufacturing is inconsistent with raising a lot of tariff revenue to pay for other things.\n\nThe tradeoff between using tariffs to boost domestic production and raise revenue is something policymakers have grappled with for centuries. In a recent paper in the Journal of Economic Perspectives, New York University professor emeritus Richard Sylla argues that Alexander Hamilton, who is celebrated by today's pro-tariff crowd, was acutely aware of this tradeoff. As a result, he disliked tariffs that drastically decreased trade. Hamilton had big plans for the federal government, including funding infrastructure projects and paying off states' Revolutionary War debts, and this required federal tax revenue, the bulk of which came from tariffs. He knew setting tariffs too high would undermine his other goals.\n\nDespite Trump's claims, tariffs will not make America great again. Dozens of studies find that universal tariffs would decrease GDP growth, especially if other countries retaliate with their own tariffs. Instead of tariffs, Trump should focus on his other campaign promises -pro-growth tax reforms that encourage innovation and regulatory reforms that unleash energy production and new construction."

[+] 'Make America Great Again' sign as the candidate addresses supporters during a campaign stop at the International Exposition Center on October 22, 2016 in Cleveland, Ohio. Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton continue to campaign as Election Day nears. (Photo by Justin Merriman/Getty Images)\n\nI recall writing (back in the 1990s and early 2000s) that one of the great things about the US was our economic mobility. By that, I mean the ability of people to shift on the economic spectrum-to move from being a low-income family to being a high-income family, for example.\n\nBut recent studies tell us this is no longer the case .\n\nIt means the America I grew up in is changing. And that cuts right into my emotional comfort zone. I guess this should not surprise me because (a) the US is always changing, and (b) the evidence clearly shows the cultural shifts and economic woes of the younger generation.\n\nMy old friend Frank Buckley is a professor at the Scalia Law School at George Mason University. He sent me this piece, and his words will make many of you uncomfortable.\n\nBuckley says that the political devolution we're now seeing in the US ( and that came to a head in the form of Trump and Sanders ) is actually a confirmation of Marxist theory (though Buckley himself is hardly a Marxist). What we see is essentially class warfare, at least in the political realm. He thinks a large portion of the populace has become disenfranchised and radicalized.\n\nBuckley then moves right to the research and shows that the United Sates is behind most of the developed world in terms of economic mobility. The irony is that much of the reason for this problem is our \"progressive\" policies. Our conservative policies are also making the situation worse compared to other countries, though.\n\nBuckley's prescription? I'll let him develop his argument for you, rather than spill the beans.\n\nRestoring America's Economic Mobility\n\nBy Frank Buckley\n\nThe following is adapted from a speech delivered on July 11, 2016 at Hillsdale College's Allan P. Kirby, Jr. Center for Constitutional Studies and Citizenship in Washington, D.C., as part of the AWC Family Foundation Lecture Series.\n\nIn the Communist Manifesto , Marx and Engels wrote that \"the history of all hitherto existing societies is the history of class struggles.\" Today, the story of American politics is the story of class struggles. It wasn't supposed to be that way. We didn't think we were divided into different classes. Neither did Marx.\n\nAmerica was an exception to Marx's theory of social progress. By that theory, societies were supposed to move from feudalism to capitalism to communism. But the America of the 1850s, the most capitalist society around, was not turning communist. Marx had an explanation for that. \"True enough, the classes already exist,\" he wrote of the United States, but they \"are in constant flux and reflux, constantly changing their elements and yielding them up to one another.\" In other words, when you have economic and social mobility, you don't go communist.\n\nThat is the country in which some imagine we still live, Horatio Alger's America-a country defined by the promise that whoever you are, you have the same chance as anyone else to rise, with pluck, industry, and talent. But they imagine wrong. The US today lags behind many of its First World rivals in terms of mobility. A class society has inserted itself within the folds of what was once a classless country, and a dominant New Class-as social critic Christopher Lasch called it-has pulled up the ladder of social advancement behind it.\n\nOne can measure these things empirically by comparing the correlation between the earnings of fathers and sons. Pew's Economic Mobility Project ranks Britain at 0.5, which means that if a father earns £100,000 more than the median, his son will earn £50,000 more than the average member of his cohort. That's pretty aristocratic. On the other end of the scale, the most economically mobile society is Denmark, with a correlation of 0.15. The US is at 0.47, almost as immobile as Britain.\n\nA complacent Republican establishment denies this change has occurred. If they don't get it, however, American voters do. For the first time, Americans don't believe their children will be as well off as they have been. They see an economy that's stalled, one in which jobs are moving offshore. In the first decade of this century, US multinationals shed 2.9 million US jobs while increasing employment overseas by 2.4 million. General Electric provides a striking example. Jeffrey Immelt became the company's CEO in 2001, with a mission to advance stock price. He did this in part by reducing GE's US workforce by 34,000 jobs. During the same period, the company added 25,000 jobs overseas. Ironically, President Obama chose Immelt to head his Jobs Council.\n\nAccording to establishment Repub­licans, none of this can be helped. We are losing middle-class jobs because of the move to a high-tech world that creates jobs for a cognitive elite and destroys them for everyone else. But that doesn't describe what's happening. We are losing middle-class jobs, but lower-class jobs are expanding. Automation is changing the way we make cars, but the rich still need their maids and gardeners. Middle-class jobs are also lost as a result of regulatory and environmental barriers, especially in the energy sector. And the skills-based technological change argument is entirely implausible: countries that beat us hands down on mobility are just as technologically advanced. Folks in Denmark aren't exactly living in the Stone Age.\n\nThis is why voters across the spectrum began to demand radical change. What did the Republican elite offer in response? At a time of maximal crisis, they have been content with minimal goals, like Mitt Romney's 59-point plan in 2012. How many Americans remember even one of those points? What we remember instead is Romney's remark about 47 percent of Americans being takers. That was Romney's way of recognizing the class divide-and in the election, Americans took notice and paid him back with interest.\n\nSince 2012, establishment Republicans have continued to be less than concerned for the plight of ordinary Americans. Sure, they want economic growth, but it doesn't seem to matter into whose pockets the money flows. There are even the \"conservative\" pundits who offer the pious hope that drug-addicted Trump supporters will hurry up and die. That's one way to ameliorate the class struggle, but it doesn't exactly endear anyone to the establishment.\n\nThe southern writer Flannery O'Connor once attended a dinner party in New York given for her and liberal intellectual Mary McCarthy. At one point, the issue of Catholicism came up and McCarthy offered the opinion that the Eucharist is \"just a symbol,\" albeit \"a pretty one.\" O'Connor, a pious Catholic, bristled: \"Well, if it's just a symbol, to Hell with it.\" Likewise, the principles held up as sacrosanct by establishment Republicans might be logically unassailable, derived like theorems from a set of axioms based on a pure theory of natural rights. But if I don't see them making people better off, I say to Hell with them. And so do the voters this year. What the establishment Republicans should ask themselves is Anton Chigurh's question in No Country for Old Men : If you followed your principles, and your principles brought you to this, what good are your principles?\n\nHad Marx been asked what would happen to America if it ever became economically immobile, we know what his answer would be: Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. And also Donald Trump. The anger expressed by the voters in 2016-their support for candidates from far outside the traditional political class-has little parallel in American history. We are accustomed to protest movements on the Left, but the wholesale repudiation of the establishment on the Right is something new. All that was solid has melted into air, and what has taken its place is a kind of right-wing Marxism, scornful of Washington power brokers and sneering pundits and repelled by America's immobile, class-ridden society.\n\nEstablishment Republicans came up with the \"right-wing Marxist\" label when House Speaker John Boehner was deposed, and labels stick when they have the ring of truth. So it is with the right-wing Marxist. He is right-wing because he seeks to return to an America of economic mobility. He has seen how broken education and immigration systems, the decline of the rule of law, and the rise of a supercharged regulatory state serve as barriers to economic improvement. And he is a Marxist to the extent that he sees our current politics as the politics of class struggle, with an insurgent middle class that seeks to surmount the barriers to mobility erected by an aristocratic New Class. In his passion, he is also a revolutionary. He has little time for a Republican elite that smirks at his heroes-heroes who communicate through their brashness and rudeness the fact that our country is in a crisis. To his more polite critics, the right-wing Marxist says: We are not so nice as you!\n\nThe right-wing Marxist notes that establishment Republicans who decry crony capitalism are often surrounded by lobbyists and funded by the Chamber of Commerce. He is unpersuaded when they argue that government subsidies are needed for their friends. He does not believe that the federal bailouts of the 2008-2012 TARP program and the Federal Reserve's zero-interest and quantitative easing policies were justified. He sees that they doubled the size of public debt over an eight-year period, and that our experiment in consumer protection for billionaires took the oxygen out of the economy and produced a jobless Wall Street recovery.\n\nThe right-wing Marxist's vision of the good society is not so very different from that of the JFK-era liberal; it is a vision of a society where all have the opportunity to rise, where people are judged by the content of their character, and where class distinctions are a thing of the past. But for the right wing Marxist, the best way to reach the goal of a good society is through free markets, open competition, and the removal of wasteful government barriers.\n\nReaders of Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose will have encountered the word palimpsest, used to describe a manuscript in which one text has been written over another, and in which traces of the original remain. So it is with Canada, a country that beats the US hands down on economic mobility. Canada has the reputation of being more liberal than the US, but in reality, it is more conservative because its liberal policies are written over a page of deep conservatism.\n\nWhereas the US comes in at a highly immobile 0.47 on the Pew mobility scale, Canada is at 0.19, very close to Denmark's 0.15. What is further remarkable about Canada is that the difference is mostly at the top and bottom of the distribution. Between the tenth and 90th deciles, there isn't much difference between the two countries. The difference is in the bottom and top ten percent, where the poorest parents raise the poorest kids and the richest parents raise the richest kids.\n\nFor parents in the top US decile, 46 percent of their kids will end up in the top two deciles and only 2 percent in the bottom decile. The members of the top decile comprise a New Class of lawyers, academics, trust-fund babies, and media types-a group that wields undue influence in both political parties and dominates our culture. These are the people who said yes, there is an immigration crisis-but it's caused by our failure to give illegals a pathway to citizenship!\n\nThere's a top ten percent in Canada, of course, but its children are far more likely to descend into the middle or lower classes. There's also a bottom ten percent, but its children are far more likely to rise to the top. The country of opportunity, the country we've imagined ourselves to be, isn't dead-it moved to Canada, a country that ranks higher than the US on measures of economic freedom. Yes, Canada has its much-vaunted Medicare system, but cross-border differences in health care don't explain the mobility levels. And when you add it all up, America has a more generous welfare system than Canada or just about anywhere else. To explain Canada's higher mobility levels, one has to turn to differences in education systems, immigration laws, regulatory burdens, the rule of law, and corruption-on all of which counts, Canada is a more conservative country.\n\nAmerica's K-12 public schools perform poorly, relative to the rest of the First World. Its universities are great fun for the kids, but many students emerge on graduation no better educated than when they arrived. What should be an elevator to the upper class is stalled on the ground floor. One study has concluded that if American public school students were magically raised to Canadian levels, the economic gain would amount to a 20 percent annual pay increase for the average American worker.\n\nThe US has a two-tiered educational system: a superb set of schools and colleges for the upper classes and a mediocre set for everyone else. The best of our colleges are the best anywhere, but the average Canadian school is better than the average American one. At both the K-12 and college levels, Canadian schools have adhered more closely to a traditional, conservative set of offerings. For K-12, a principal reason for the difference is the greater competition offered in Canada, with its publicly-supported church-affiliated schools. With barriers like America's Blaine Amendments-state laws preventing public funding of religious schools-lower-class students in the US must enjoy the dubious blessing of a public school education.\n\nWhat about immigration? Canada doesn't have a problem with illegal aliens-it deports them. As for the legal intake, Canadian policies have a strong bias towards admitting immigrants who will confer a benefit on Canadian citizens. Even in absolute numbers, Canada admits more immigrants under economic categories than the US, where most legal immigrants qualify instead under family preference categories. As a result, on average, immigrants to the US are less educated than US natives, and unlike in Canada, second- and third-generation US immigrants earn less than their native-born counterparts. In short, the US immigration system imports inequality and immobility. If immigration isn't an issue in Canada, that's because it's a system Trump voters would love.\n\nFor those at the bottom of the social and economic ladder who seek to rise, nothing is more important than the rule of law, property rights, and the sanctity of contract provided by a mature and efficient legal system. The alternative-in place today in America-is a network of elites whose personal bonds supply the trust that is needed before deals can be done and promises relied on. With its more traditional legal system, Canada better respects the sanctity of contract and is less likely to weaken property rights with an American-style civil justice system which at times resembles a slot machine of judicially-sanctioned theft. Americans are great at talking about the rule of law, but in reality, we don't have much standing to do so.\n\nThen there's corruption. As ranked by Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index, America is considerably more corrupt than most of the rest of the First World. With our K Street lobbyists and our donor class, we've spawned the greatest concentration of money and influence ever. And corruption costs. In a regression model, the average family's earnings would increase from $55,000 to $60,000 were we to ascend to Canada's level of non-corruption, and to $68,000 if we moved to Denmark's level.\n\nIn a corrupt country, trust is a rare commodity. That's America today. Only 19 percent of Americans say they trust the government most of the time, down from 73 percent in 1958 according to the Pew Research Center. Sadly, that is a rational response to the way things are. America is a different country today, and a much nastier one. For politically engaged Republicans, the figure is six percent. That in a nutshell explains the Trump phenomenon and the disintegration of the Republican establishment. If the people don't trust the government, tinkering with entitlement reform is like rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.\n\nAmerican legal institutions are consistently more liberal than those in Canada, and they are biased towards a privileged class of insiders who are better educated and wealthier than the average American. That's why America has become an aristocracy. By contrast, Canadian legal institutions aren't slanted to an aristocracy.\n\nThe paradox is that Canadians employ conservative, free market means to achieve the liberal end of economic mobility. And that points to America's way back: acknowledge that the promise of America has diminished, then emulate Canada."

      "website": "https://www.forbes.com",
      "text": "President Trump Will Make America's Energy Sector Great Again\n\nBy Christopher Helman\n\nBy Christopher Helman ,\n\nForbes Staff.\n\nWe'll see more fracking, more pipelines, a defanged EPA, and no carbon tax.\n\nAs he declared in his victory speech last night, President Trump will root his efforts to make America great again in vast infrastructure projects, tax cuts and pro-business policies that he says will result in millions of new jobs and economic growth. That's good for steel and concrete suppliers (Nucor is up 12% today). And great for fossil fuel producers.\n\nWith control of the White House and Congress, President Obama's coal-killing Clean Power Plan is likely history. The EPA will be declawed. The U.S. will not ratify the Paris climate accord. And there will be no chance of a federal carbon tax or cap-and-trade regime. That's good news for coal miners (like Foresight Energy, up 24% today) and owners of coal-fired power plants. Bad news for environmental zealots.\n\n\"On day one, he will commence by undoing the onerous regulations placed on every industry in the past eight years,\" said billionaire oilman Harold Hamm in a statement to Forbes after the election. \"We can now look forward to a reliable supply of affordable energy.\"\n\n(AP Photo/Carlos Osorio)\n\nExpect American oil and gas production to surge. We will see an abrupt end to the Bureau of Land Management's efforts to grab authority to regulate hydraulic fracturing on federal lands. A federal case on BLM's overreach in making fracking rules was set to be heard by the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals Jan. 17. Trump's BLM will have no interest in regulating fracking. Voters in Youngstown, Ohio rejected for the sixth time an initiative that would have banned fracking locally. Though a frack-ban did pass in Monterey County, Calif. That's no biggie: oil companies have plenty more drilling sites frack-friendly Texas, Oklahoma and North Dakota. The likelihood of Trump appointing Hamm secretary of energy is vanishingly small - he has wells to drill. But the Trump advisor is gleeful in the knowledge that with Hillary gone fracking won't be going anywhere. \"America will thrive during a Donald Trump presidency,\" says Hamm. \"I can tell you now that we will be energy independent.\" Hamm's Continental Resources closed up 3.50% Wednesday.\n\nTrump's pro-infrastructure regulators will unlock private capital for pipeline projects. On the campaign trail Trump had expressed his support for the Keystone XL pipeline, and today TransCanada announced its determination to reapply for its permits and build the thing (TransCanada closed up 2.40% on the day). Trump will also likely push through the North Dakota Access Pipeline; its sponsor, Energy Transfer, was up 16%. The recent outages on the Colonial pipeline underscore the need for America to invest in more pipeline infrastructure.\n\nA Trump bump for oil, gas and coal could mean fewer dollars flowing into renewables and nuclear. Though candidate Trump spoke about the need for America to build more nuclear power plants, nothing will change the fact that without a cost of carbon neither nuclear nor renewable can compete with natural gas. Big wind turbine maker Vestas dropped 16% today after Trump's victory, while Tesla is down 4.4%. As Forbes contributor Michael Lynch (@laffngeconomist) tweeted last week, Tesla's big new solar roof system is \"probably the most expensive way to reduce GHG emissions short of lawyers on hamster wheels.\" That said, Trump is likely to be \"more everything\" when it comes to energy, so don't expect any cuts to green power subsidies.\n\nA Trump victory is bad news for OPEC. More American oil will compete head-to-head with the cartel. Since President Obama signed a law last year lifting the ban, exports of American oil have surged to 700,000 bpd, as much as Qatar. Worth noting that OPEC tyrannies have been big donors to the Clinton Foundation, with Saudis giving about $30 million, Qataris $5 million, Kuwait up to $10 million and millions more from the UAE.\n\nCandidate Trump said last March that he would seek to block imports of oil from Saudi Arabia (currently about 1 million bpd) unless the Kingdom did more to fight ISIS. This is exceptionally unlikely. Saudi Aramco's refineries on the Gulf Coast are optimized for Saudi crude and blocking their supplies would be seen as a blow against blue collar refinery workers, who likely voted overwhelmingly for Trump.\n\nCould President Trump scrap Obama's deal with Iran? In March he told Israeli group AIPAC that dismantling the deal would be a \" number-one priority. \" Whether or not he follows through on that threat, expect Iran to maximize output in the coming months, just in case. That will hurt OPEC's efforts to cut output and raise prices.\n\nGasoline prices on this election day averaged $2.20 a gallon. Four years ago it was $3.46. Watch for a jump in SUV sales."

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nArt admirers and history buffs have a chance to own a 30-plus-pound marble Make America Great Again hat for $48,000.\n\n\"This is a recording of history,\" artist Robin Antar told Newsweek . \"It makes different conversation with viewers at different times.\"\n\nThe phrase \"Make America Great Again\" refers to President-elect Donald Trump 's slogan, which started with his 2016 presidential campaign. MAGA, however, also refers to the president-elect's political base. Former President Ronald Reagan used a similar campaign slogan in 1980, \"Let's Make America Great Again.\" Many commentators have called the slogan racist and sexist.\n\nTrump will take office on January 20 after Congress certified his victory on Monday, four years after a pro-Trump mob stormed the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, and tried to block Congress from certifying Joe Biden 's victory in the 2020 election. Vice President Kamala Harris , who lost to Trump in November's presidential election, oversaw the session and declared Trump the victor in her role as president of the Senate . The inauguration of the president-elect will now go on as planned.\n\nAntar's work is centered around creating visual records of the societal experiences around her. Following the terror attacks on September 11, 2001, Antar bar saw other artists recreating images around the American flag and the Twin Towers. She, however, started to ask, \"what is America?\"\n\n\"America is comfort food, candy, cookies, M&Ms,\" Antar said. \"That's when I started my realism series.\"\n\nThe New York artist has been sculpting since she was 15. She has been on exhibit by herself at the School of Visual Arts in 1997 and most recently at the Pop International Gallery in 2018. She's also been a part of group exhibitions, like the 2015 \"Art inspired by Food\" exhibit at Gallery Juno and the 2022 \"Allied Artists of America Exhibition\" at the Butler Institute of American Art. She has also been shown in art fairs across the country and through public sculpture installations.\n\nAntar has created sculptures of work boats, a pencil, jeans, Oreos, a burger, chips and boxing gloves.\n\nThe 30-plus-pound Make America Great Again golf cap, which was made in 2016, comes from the one Trump wore on the 2016 campaign trail. The hat was white, so she chose the appropriately colored marble. The blue words were sandblasted by a headstone business, which then spray painted the letters.\n\nAntar said that with the granite base, the sculpture probably weighs closer to 90 pounds.\n\n\"It had nothing to do with if I like Trump or hate Trump. That's totally irrelevant, and it's not important to the work,\" she said. \"What I do is record what's going on. If I saw something within the Democratic Party , a symbol, I would have sculpted that too. It doesn't mean I love either party, it just means I'm recording what I see in front of me.\"\n\nAntar has touched on political symbols in the past, with one sculpture depicting the U.S. Constitution in a knot. She said it was her statement that the world is in \"knots and everyone's fighting with each other.\"\n\nBut her artwork hasn't been short of controversy. Antar has had to remove some photos of the artwork on her website and Instagram page, and each time she posts to social media she loses \"a couple thousand followers.\" She said that when her MAGA hat was on display around 2017, she was told she had to take the photos off her website because she was told \"customers are threatening to boycott our gallery.\"\n\n\"A couple years later, now, I said 'No. This is what I'm doing,'\" Antar said. \"This is what's going on in America.\"\n\nSculptor Robin Antar on her Make America Great Again sculpture: \"It had nothing to do with if I like Trump or hate Trump. That's totally irrelevant, and it's not important to the work.\"\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump said in a 2015 interview with MyFox New York: \"The line of 'Make America Great Again,' the phrase, that was mine, I came up with it about a year ago, and I kept using it, and everybody's now using it, they are all loving it.\"\n\nWhile the hat sculpture is on sale, Antar said she wants to use it \"for a museum show.\"\n\n\"I want the U.S. Constitution, the boxing gloves, the M&Ms and the MAGA hat in a museum show,\" she said.\n\nAntar said her next piece that she has almost completed is about the victims of the October 7, 2023, attacks that Hamas conducted in Israel. After that, she's using a 24,000-pound of Carrara marble to make a bag of trash.\n\nMonica is a Newsweek reporter based in Boston. Her focus is reporting on breaking news.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nPresident Trump endorsed South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham 's reelection bid in a post on his Truth Social website on Tuesday, but the move didn't sit well with some members of his MAGA (Make America Great Again) base with several commentators labeling him a Republican in name only (RINO).\n\nGraham has announced he will seek a fifth Senate term at the 2026 midterm elections, though he is widely expected to face a primary challenge from within the Republican Party .\n\nNewsweek contacted Senator Graham's Washington D.C. office for comment on Thursday by email outside of regular office hours.\n\nGraham was initially a sharp Trump critic, branding the then Republican presidential candidate a \"race-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot,\" in December 2015 to a loyal and outspoken supporter . This demonstrates the extent to which the GOP has changed in the Trump era, and that the president is prepared to forgive a previous opponent, though some grassroots MAGA supporters believe Graham can't be trusted.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump endorsed Graham on Truth Social, writing: \"Senator Lindsey Graham has my Complete and Total Endorsement for Re-Election...Everyone in South Carolina should help Lindsey have a BIG WIN next year!\"\n\nGraham welcomed the endorsement on X, which he said \"means the world to me,\" but some of Trump's grassroots supports were sharply critical.\n\nOn X, Kylie Jane Kremer, an organizer of the January 6, 2021 \"Save America\" rally, which ended with hundreds of Trump supporters storming Congress , shared the president's post, adding: \"Love Trump & this changes nothing. But he is wrong on this endorsement. The American people are tired of this RINO in South Carolina.\"\n\nMila Joy, a Trump supporter from the state of Washington with over 198,000 X followers, also shared a screenshot of Trump's message, adding: \"Trump cannot be serious. Someone, anyone needs to primary Lindsey Graham.\"\n\nThe \"Being Libertarian\" X account, which has nearly 288,000 followers, commented: \"A Trump endorsement of Lindsey Graham in 2025 is a sad reminder that politics is ugly and the swamp still has a lot of power. Sad.\"\n\nBonchie, a writer for conservative website RedState, posted: \"You know, it's not so much that Trump keeps endorsing Lindsey Graham that bothers me. Politics is transactional, though if another Republican endorsed Graham, they'd be tarred and feathered. It's more the lying about who Graham is that gets me.\"\n\nAmerica First Insight, a group which says it exists to \"champion an America First agenda,\" also shared a screenshot of Trump's endorsement on X, adding: \"Well I'll tell you what, we certainly won't be endorsing Lindsey Graham.\"\n\nLindsey Graham, a longtime critic of Moscow, attracted attention in February when he suggested Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky should leave office after he clashed with Trump and Vice President JD Vance in the White House with journalists watching on.\n\nHowever, Graham has also urged the Trump administration not to abandon Ukraine, saying doing so would be \"worse than Afghanistan\" with regard to the 2021 U.S. and allied withdrawal, which left the Taliban in control of the country.\n\nIn his Truth Social post endorsing Graham, Trump wrote: \"Lindsey has been a wonderful friend to me, and has always been there when I needed him. As the Chair of the Senate Budget Committee, Lindsey is fighting tirelessly to Grow the Economy, Lower Taxes, and Eliminate Government Waste.\n\n\"Lindsey is also relentlessly focused on helping us Secure the Border, Stop Migrant Crime, Strongly Support our Great Military/Vets, Promote American Energy DOMINANCE, Defend our always under siege Second Amendment, and ensure PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH.\"\n\nIn response on X, Graham said: \"President Trump's endorsement means the world to me. I am humbled by his faith in me as a Senator and as a friend. On a professional level, I am proud to have been there at the beginning when President Trump - through sheer force of will -achieved the greatest political comeback in American history.\n\n\"I look forward to being one of the driving forces in the U.S. Senate to enact President Trump's agenda to make America more prosperous and more secure. Thank you, Mr. President.\"\n\nSpeaking about Trump in a December 2015 CNN interview, Graham said: \"You know how you make America great again? Tell Donald Trump to go to hell. He's a race-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot. He doesn't represent my party. He doesn't represents the values that the men and women who wear the uniform are fighting for.\"\n\nTrump's endorsement is a big boost to Graham's reelection campaign, but it is still likely he will face a primary challenge from within the Republican Party. Graham will be under pressure not to offend Trump, to ensure the endorsement isn't rescinded, at least until the primary contest is over.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nJames Bickerton is a Newsweek U.S. News reporter based in London, U.K. His focus is on covering news and politics in Texas, as well as other general news across the United States.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump is if nothing not a salesman, managing to sell his brand of politics not only to voters on the ballot but also to his most ardent supporters through a web of merchandise, trinkets and knick-knacks.\n\nThere is no emblem more Trump than a bright red baseball hat emblazoned with the words, \"Make America Great Again,\" one of dozens of item for sale in the Trump store. Also on the shelves are needlepoint Trump flasks ($68), Trump charcuterie boards ($95), \"freedom ties\" ($125) and Trump sneakers ($225).\n\n\"It seems like Trump's official merchandise store has a penchant for capitalizing on his every move,\" Summer Anne Lee, a fashion historian and adjunct professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology, told Newsweek . \"They are already selling items to commemorate his upcoming second inauguration, in everything from hats, shirts, and buttons to beer koozies and playing cards.\"\n\nIt's not just the Trump name. Never before has an incoming administration been staffed with so many people hawking their own personal brands and lines of products.\n\nNot only can you smell like Trump (\"Fight Fight Fight\" has \"rich, robust notes that leave a lasting impression\"), but you can also drink coffee shilled by former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani , read your children books about \"King Donald\" sold by Trump's FBI chief pick Kash Patel, and take herbal supplements promoted by Mehmet Oz, Trump's choice for Medicare and Medicaid administrator.\n\nLee said all political figures and presidential candidates have merch but \"Trumpism goes beyond the norm.\"\n\n\"It's impossible to ignore that Trump has developed a cult of personality where his most passionate fanbase idealizes him as an American hero or even a religious figure chosen by God,\" she said. \"For these supporters, voting for Trump is a central part of their identity, and they want to make that known.\"\n\nSince the days of Founding Fathers, wearable buttons have existed to commemorate presidential campaigns or inaugurations. Throughout the 19th century and into the 20th century, presidential pins, walking sticks and handkerchiefs were also popular items.\n\nLee said that the first notable \"explosion\" of presidential merch came in 1952 when Dwight D. Eisenhower sold a variety of items associated with his presidential campaign, which featured the popular slogan \"You like Ike, I like Ike, everybody likes Ike for President.\" He did the same when he ran for re-election in 1956.\n\n\"People purchased all of the things mentioned before and more, including neckties, bowties, and even women's dresses and jewelry, all emblazoned with some iteration of the slogan 'I Like Ike,'\" Lee said. \"The enthusiasm wasn't just for show: in both races, Eisenhower defeated Democrat Adlai Stevenson in a landslide.\"\n\nSteven Schier, a political scientist and analyst, told Newsweek , \"We can expect a steady stream of Trump and MAGA-themed merchandise in 2025,\" including items developed by Trump's co-chairs of the new Department of Government Efficiency, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy , and by independent companies who want to cash in on these markets.\n\nLee said that even the red MAGA hat, a bit long in the tooth now nearly a decade after its debut, could see a resurgence. The historian predicted that Trump's popular vote victory could lead his supporters to feel more confident about declaring their allegiance to the Trump brand in public.\n\nEven as these wares raise questions about profiteering off the government, Schier said that \"such bling is unlikely to draw legal challenges if the creators handle things right.\"\n\nElon Musk, CEO of Tesla, on X, last month: \"Department of Government Efficiency The merch will be 🔥🔥🔥\"\n\nSummer Anne Lee, the author of the forthcoming \"Presidential Fashion: An Illustrated History,\" told Newsweek : \"We all signal who we think we are or want to be through our clothing every day. For some, wearing designer brands is an important way to show their status and style. For others, wearing some type of merchandise from their favorite band, video game, TV show, influencer, etc., is an important way to show others what their interests are.\"\n\nVanessa Friedman, the fashion director of the New York Times ' Style section, wrote in an article predicting the trends of 2025 : \"What could be next? Scent of the Oval? A build-your-own-wall kit? Crime-buster shades? Maybe just a treasury friendship bracelet, with gold beads. Whatever the answer, you can bet it's going to be more than a button.\"\n\nJordan Libowitz, a vice president at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, told ABC News last month: \"We've never seen a president merchandise like this. Tracking partners is very difficult unless they come forward, and there's no way to know for sure.\"\n\nJoe Conason, author of \"The Longest Con: How Grifters, Swindlers, and Frauds Hijacked American Conservatism,\" told the Guardian : \"The one thing that could settle it down, I guess, is if Trump actually does drive the country into a depression with his tariffs and his arresting 11 million people who do a lot of the work in this country. He could make people poor enough that they wouldn't be able to buy the stuff any more. But otherwise, I think it's going to go on and on and continue to grow.\"\n\nWhether the market for MAGA merch remains robust \"all depends on Trump's success at governing,\" according to Schier.\n\nAhead of Trump's return to the White House later this month, the Trump 47 Inaugural Collection is already available online. It includes commemorative MAGA hats ($40), whiskey glasses ($60), cufflinks ($25) and fleece blankets ($60).\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nKatherine Fung is a Newsweek senior reporter based in New York City.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nPresident Donald Trump 's agenda is quickly taking shape in the weeks since he returned to power vowing to end social liberalism and usher in a new era of American prosperity. Through a shock-and-awe flurry of executive orders and other actions, Trump started a massive crackdown on illegal immigration, withdrew the United States from the World Health Organization and Paris climate accord , issued sweeping pardons to the rioters charged with participating in the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol and began the process of dismantling federal diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Welcome to Trump's self-described \"golden age of America.\"\n\nThe administration's early moves have put Washington-and the rest of the world-on notice that Trump is determined to turn his campaign promises into reality. Anyone doubting his sense of mission would do well to remember Trump's belief that divine intervention helped him survive an assassin's bullet and reclaim the White House. \"My life was saved for a reason,\" Trump told the nation in his second inaugural address. \"I was saved by God to make America great again.\"\n\nThe MAGA project is clear by now, nearly one decade into the Era of Trump. The question is, how effective can Trump be in his second go-around?\n\nThe initial signs seem promising for Trump, starting with the fact that the political environment is friendlier to him now than it was when he took office as a Beltway outsider in 2017. Back then, Trump's party controlled Congress but he faced internal opposition from moderate Republicans , as well as a highly energized Democratic resistance.\n\nToday, Trump loyalists dominate the leadership and rank-and-file in the GOP-controlled House and Senate . The federal courts are also now loaded with Trump appointees, including the three justices Trump placed on the U.S. Supreme Court to give the conservative bloc a 6-3 majority. Democrats haven't settled on a strategy going forward, after spending all of last year arguing that Trump's impeachments, felony conviction, other legal problems and failed effort to overturn his 2020 election loss made him an existential threat to democracy.\n\n\"People are thinking about institutions where they can pull levers of power and not just be sort of out in the streets in that resistance posture\" Democrats adopted when Trump took office the first time, said Tory Gavito, a Democratic strategist. \"It's not going to look the same.\"\n\nRepublicans point to the disarray on the left and the team Trump's assembled as proof that his second term will be more productive than the first. Trump sparked anger with his picks to lead the Defense and Justice Departments (former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz , Trump's first pick to serve as attorney general, withdrew his bid amid sexual assault allegations). But Trump has also surrounded himself with a trusted inner circle of aides who could bring discipline to the West Wing, the argument goes. The group is led by top domestic policy adviser Stephen Miller and White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles , Trump's 2024 campaign co-manager and a universally respected figure in Republican circles.\n\nBut Trump's success is by no means assured as he embarks on his second term. He's already facing significant obstacles to his agenda-from ending Russia's war in Ukraine to avoiding a government shutdown in March and securing an extension of his first-term tax cuts. Trump aides, allies outside of the administration, party strategists and Republicans in Congress all know they have limited time to show results before facing voters again in the 2026 midterm elections.\n\n\"Trump recognizes that the midterms are much closer than they appear and the margins in the House and Senate are very close,\" said Matt Mackowiak, a Republican strategist. \"He's got probably 18 months\" to cement his second-term legacy.\n\nShortly after winning the election, in one of his first key personnel appointments, Trump named Thomas Homan as his administration's \"border czar\" in charge of stopping illegal immigration. Homan, who served as acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the first Trump term, made frequent headlines during the transition period, warning that Trump's mass deportation plan would cost $86 billion and require 100,000 ICE detention beds.\n\nWhile Homan served as the point person for the coming crackdown, a team of immigration advisers worked quietly behind the scenes to prepare executive orders so Trump could get to work right away on the issue after getting sworn in. According to multiple sources involved in the work, the executive orders Trump ended up signing were designed to avoid the legal pitfalls that stymied much of his immigration agenda at the start of his first term.\n\nTrump's Day 1 executive orders this time included declaring a national emergency at the border; suspending the refugee admissions program; ending the CBP One app for asylum-seekers; and limiting birthright citizenship, which prompted a lawsuit led by the American Civil Liberties Union .\n\n\"Denying citizenship to U.S.-born children is not only unconstitutional-it's also a reckless and ruthless repudiation of American values,\" said ACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero.\n\nNewsweek reached out to the White House for comment for this story. It's too early to know how the new legal battles will play out, but immigration rights advocates and others concede that the president's immigration advisers learned from the mistakes of the first Trump administration.\n\n\"With better-crafted EOs, courts may be less likely to issue injunctions,\" Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration expert at Cornell Law School, said. \"From a legal perspective [the executive orders] may more easily pass judicial scrutiny.\"\n\nCreating a mass deportation program may prove much harder, however. ICE currently has space to house roughly 40,000 detainees, less than half the capacity Homan said is needed. Then there's the financial hurdles involved. Trump struggled to secure border funding from Congress in his first term. It's unclear how Trump and his allies in Congress will come up with tens of billions for a mass deportation program in the midst of a budget battle over other spending priorities and tax cuts that will dominate the coming months.\n\nMoreover, the Obama administration set a record with 432,000 deportations in fiscal year 2013, federal data shows. Trump would have to surpass that total every year to reach his goal. \"Even if Congress appropriates more money, it certainly is never going to be enough to deport millions of people\" in a single term, Yale-Loehr said.\n\nRepublicans believe the early debates over deportation scenarios under Trump miss the fact that he's succeeded in shifting the country to the right on immigration overall. \"He's completely changed the conversation on immigration,\" said Brian Seitchik, a Republican strategist and former Trump campaign official. \"Trump has already won on this issue.\"\n\nThe same may not be true for energy policy, another priority area for Trump that's filled with potential political minefields. Upon taking office, Trump signed an executive order declaring a national energy emergency. Aimed at boosting the fossil fuel industry, the move is part of an effort to roll back former President Joe Biden 's climate policies and fulfill an inaugural pledge to \"Drill, baby, drill.\"\n\nBut Trump's promise to make the country energy dominant belies the fact that the United States is already a leading energy power. America is now the world's leading producer of crude oil and largest exporter of liquefied natural gas, according to data from the federal Energy Information Administration.\n\nAt the same time, Trump's continued claim that climate change is a hoax is also increasingly at odds with many lawmakers in his own party. Trump drew some praise from the right for pulling the U.S. back out of the Paris climate treaty, but a growing number of Republicans have quietly accepted the science around global warming and embraced an \"all-of-the-above\" strategy that includes clean energy.\n\nYet Trump's emergency declaration notably left out wind and solar, which together account for 14 percent of U.S. electricity generation. Trump also took separate action to halt offshore wind development. Unlike some of the carefully written executive orders on immigration, the wind power ban is viewed among industry insiders as overly broad and subject to potential challenge in court. Any attempts to cut clean energy programs under Biden's Inflation Reduction Act will also face opposition from Republican lawmakers whose states and districts stand to benefit from investment in renewable projects.\n\n\"It's the Trump administration who will be in office when all of this hiring occurs. So it would be political malpractice to undo all of these investments,\" Jennifer Granholm , Biden's energy secretary and a former Michigan Democratic governor, told Newsweek in an interview shortly before Trump took office.\n\nThe tricky politics around energy extend to the debate over electric vehicles, or EVs. Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office ending a Biden administration goal to have EVs make up 50 percent of all U.S. car sales by 2030. But the Environmental Protection Agency may need new rules to accompany Trump's decision in order for it to hold up. And while close Trump ally and Tesla founder Elon Musk has voiced support for ending Biden-era EV subsidies, doing so could draw opposition from some Republican lawmakers.\n\n\"I think he's never going to get over\" his opposition to things like EVs and wind power, Frank Maisano, a senior principal in Bracewell's Policy Resolution Group, said of Trump. \"The president through his executive orders took a symbolic, agenda-setting approach\" to energy, but \"a lot of that is going to have to be implemented by Congress.\"\n\nTrump doesn't have to rely on Congress to flex American power overseas. On the international stage, Trump entered office riding some momentum after his Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, played a role in helping Israel reach a ceasefire deal with Hamas in Gaza in the final days of the Biden administration. Trump took partial credit for the victory and used it to argue that it was a sign of things to come under his watch as a strong commander-in-chief.\n\nElsewhere, China has already signaled that it's willing to work with the new administration on economic issues, an indication Beijing may wish to avoid another trade war. As a candidate, Trump promised to impose steep tariffs on imports from China and other countries. But he held off on pursuing the plan in his first actions after returning to the White House. The decision came as Trump directed the Justice Department to pause its ban on TikTok while he explores ways to keep the app's China-based parent company in business in the U.S.\n\nArguably, Trump's biggest foreign policy challenge is on the issue he promised to fix right away: winding down Russia's war in Ukraine. On the campaign trail last year Trump said he would end the war in his first 24 hours as president. Now that he's back in office, reality is starting to set in. Secretary of State Marco Rubio , Vice President JD Vance and others in Trump's orbit share his wish to bring a swift conclusion to Europe's largest land war since World War II.\n\nStill, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky have the final word on a negotiated settlement to the conflict. As the war nears a grim three-year anniversary, it remains unclear what terms would satisfy Putin's expansionism as well as Zelensky's desire for security guarantees from the West to protect Ukraine against future Russian aggression.\n\nIn his first term, Trump's \"America First\" doctrine meant clashing with allies and cozying up to authoritarian rulers like Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un . In the second term, Trump has added his own expansionist impulse to the mix with calls for the United States to take back the Panama Canal and somehow buy Greenland for national security purposes.\n\n\"We're in the bubble period right now. All things are possible and [the president is saying that] everything's going to go great,\" said John Bolton , who served as National Security Adviser to Trump but has turned into a vocal critic. \"He certainly knows more than he did before. And he feels more confident,\" Bolton added, but \"the evidence remains that the second term will look like the first term with respect to the chaos and lack of any effective philosophy and strategy.\"\n\nHis pronouncements on global affairs in his first weeks in office bolster the argument that Trump 2.0 won't be all that different. The pardons he issued to hundreds of January 6 rioters also signaled he isn't planning to let go of the past, and some Republicans worry Trump may distract from his agenda by exacting retribution against political opponents or paying too much attention to culture war issues.\n\n\"Without another election to be worried about, his legacy and place in history will be at the forefront of his thinking,\" said another Republican source who's worked with Trump in the past. \"Trump's biggest impediment to success is Trump, as it always is. Sometimes he just can't get out of his own way. That's certainly possible now.\"\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nDaniel Bush is a Newsweek White House correspondent based in Washington, D.C.

      "text": "Donald Trump Hits Back at Escalating China Trade War: 'Economic Revolution'\n\nMandy Taheri is a Newsweek reporter based in Brooklyn. She joined Newsweek as a reporter in 2024. You can get in touch with Mandy via email: m.taheri@newsweek.com. Languages: English, French\n\nBased on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.\n\nNewsweek AI is in beta. Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nPresident Donald Trump called his global tariff policy an \"economic revolution\" on Saturday, using his Truth Social platform to defend the sweeping trade moves that led China to announce retaliatory tariffs on Friday.\n\nThe president claimed that China \"has been hit much harder than the USA\" from the recently announced trade policies and urged Americans to \"hang tough.\"\n\nNewsweek has reached out to several global trade experts and economists for comment via email on Saturday.\n\nTrump's mid-week announcement included new tariffs on all imported goods from 180 countries as well as a list of \" reciprocal duties \" targeting China and other countries, with Asian nations most hard hit, claiming to combat trade imbalances and restore America's manufacturing industry. He hailed the tariffs as the country's \"declaration of economic independence.\"\n\nChina, the world's second-largest economy , will face a 34 percent reciprocal tariff, which will start on April 9, and is in addition to a 20 percent tariff that is already in effect. The list claims that China charges a 67 percent tariff on U.S. products. On Friday, China announced the same retaliatory tariff on the U.S. at 34 percent.\n\nTrump's tariffs and shakeup of global trade has rattled global and domestic markets, with Wall Street tanking over the past few days, marking the worst days for the U.S. stock markets since 2020 .\n\nTrump's universal, baseline 10 percent tariffs went into effect early Saturday. Announced April 2-which Trump dubbed \"Liberation Day\"-the tariffs have triggered market turmoil and drawn sharp criticism from world leaders who have also responded with retaliatory tariffs.\n\nMeanwhile, many Americans, including some Republicans , have voiced concerns over the state of the economy following Trump's sweeping tariffs.\n\nBy market close on Friday, the S&P 500 index was down nearly 6 percent and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 5.5 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index lost 5.82 percent. Trump has insisted that markets will \"boom\" as a result of his trade war.\n\nIn a Saturday Truth Social post, Trump claimed that \"China has been hit much harder than the USA, not even close.\" He said the U.S. has \"been the dumb and helpless 'whipping post,' but not any longer,\" suggesting that the tariffs and disruption to global trade will boost American manufacturing and spur business growth.\n\nFederal data shows the U.S. total goods trade with China was worth an estimated $582.4 billion in 2024. U.S. imports from China far outweigh exports to it, the kind of trade deficit that sits in the center of Trump's criticism of existing American trading relationships.\n\nThe president wrote, \"Already, more than FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT, and rising fast!\" It is unclear what investment Trump is referring to, but since his Wednesday announcement over $5 trillion has been erased from the U.S. stock markets.\n\nHis post concluded: \"THIS IS AN ECONOMIC REVOLUTION, AND WE WILL WIN. HANG TOUGH, it won't be easy, but the end result will be historic. We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\"\n\nConcerns over a potential recession and rising economic hardship are growing among Americans. Even before the recent stock market tumble, a majority of Americans believed the country was headed for a recession within the year, according to a poll by Ipsos that was published on Wednesday.\n\nThe survey conducted between March 25-26 among 1,085 adults found that 61 percent of respondents expect the U.S. to enter a recession within the next 12 months. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 5.1 percentage points.\n\nOn Friday, Trump posted that China \"played it wrong\" by announcing reciprocal tariffs. However, in another post he indicated that he looks \"forward to working with TikTok and China to close the Deal.\"\n\nTikTok, a popular video-sharing application owned by the China-based company ByteDance, has faced significant legal and regulatory challenges in the U.S., with a looming ban that was set to go into effect on April 5, but Trump has pushed it another 75 days.\n\nBenn Steil, senior fellow and director of international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations, told Newsweek in an email Saturday : \"Trump's tariffs are indeed revolutionary in size and scope-surpassing even those of the notorious Smoot-Hawley tariffs of 1930, which spread the Great Depression globally and deepened it at home. If implemented fully, they will mean higher prices, plummeting investment, and millions of unnecessarily unemployed Americans.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Nearly half of all U.S. imports are intermediate goods, vital to production here at home. Without such goods, American firms will be uncompetitive globally-or, in many cases, simply unable even to continue production. When you factor in retaliatory tariffs and other new trade barriers from abroad, it is clear that U.S. exports will plunge along with imports.\"\n\nThe Chinese finance ministry said on Friday : \"This practice of the U.S. is not in line with international trade rules, undermines China's legitimate rights and interests, and is a typical unilateral bullying practice.\"\n\nScott Kennedy, senior adviser and trustee chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), told Newsweek in an email earlier this week : \"Their [Asian countries'] growing role in the global economy historically has been seen as an important source of their economic development as well as a foundation for stronger ties with the United States. The Trump administration, instead, sees these countries as aggressors and itself as a victim in these relationships.\"\n\nYun Sun, director of the China Program at the Stimson Center, told Newsweek earlier this week: \"China is already reaching out to U.S. allies such as Japan, ROK [South Korea] and European countries to explore the alternative global order without U.S. as its leader. The reciprocal tariffs will give these countries a big push toward China to at least prepare alternatives. With the harsh policy of U.S., China suddenly looks much less hostile or evil.\"\n\nRepresentative Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican, told Newsweek on Friday: \"Nebraskans want free trade agreements, not trade animosity.\"\n\nThe 10 percent \"baseline\" tariff on all imports took effect Saturday, and the \"discounted reciprocal\" tariffs targeting America's largest trading partners are set to begin on April 9.\n\nChina's 34 percent tariffs on U.S. products will go into effect on Thursday.\n\nUpdate 4/5/25, 2:18 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with comment from Steil.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\n\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\n\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\n\nMandy Taheri is a Newsweek reporter based in Brooklyn.

Originally from New Zealand, Flynn joined Newsweek in 2024 and had previously worked at the Wairarapa Times-Age . He is a graduate of Victoria University of Wellington.

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nFormer president Donald Trump has been declared the winner of the 2024 presidential election, beating Vice President Kamala Harris .\n\nThe Associated Press called the race at 5:38 a.m. ET.\n\nThe president-elect declared victory in a speech from Florida at 2:30 a.m. ET, saying he had masterminded the \"greatest political movement of all time.\"\n\nHere is the full transcript of his remarks:\n\n\"Thank you very much. Wow. Well, I want to thank you all very much. This is great. These are our friends. We have thousands of friends in this incredible movement. This is a movement like nobody's ever seen before and, frankly, this was, I believe, the greatest political movement of all time. There's never been anything like this in this country, and maybe the, and now it's going to reach a new level of importance because we're going to help our country heal. We're going to help our country heal. We have a country that needs help, and it needs help very badly. We're going to fix our borders, we're going to fix everything about our country and we've made history for a reason tonight, and the reason is going to be just that.\n\n\"We overcame obstacles that nobody thought possible and it is now clear that we've achieved the most incredible political thing, look what happened, is this crazy? But it's a political victory that our country has never seen before, nothing like this. I want to thank the American people for the extraordinary honor of being elected your 47th president and your 45th president. And every citizen, I will fight for you, for your family and your future, every single day I will be fighting for you with every breath in my body, I will not rest until we have delivered the strong, safe and prosperous America that our children deserve and that you deserve. This will truly be the golden age of America, that's what we have to have.\n\n\"This is a magnificent victory for the American people that will allow us to make America great again, and in addition to having won the battleground states of North Carolina, I love these places, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, we are now winning in Michigan, Arizona, Nevada and Alaska, which would result in us carrying at least 315 electoral votes. But that, but it's much easier doing what the networks did or whoever called it, because there was no other path. There was no other path to victory. We also have won the popular vote, that was great. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Winning the popular vote was very nice, very nice, I will tell you. It's a great, a great feeling of love. We have a great feeling of love in this very large room with unbelievable people standing by my side. These people have been incredible, they've made the journey with me and we're going to make you very happy, we're going to make you very proud of your vote. I hope that you're going to be looking back someday and say, that was one of the truly important moments of my life when I voted for this group of people beyond the president, this group of great people.\n\n\"America has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate. We have taken back control of the Senate . Wow. That's great. And the Senate races in Montana, Nevada, Texas, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania were all won by the MAGA movement, they helped so much. And in those cases, every one of them, we worked with the senators, they were tough races. And I mean, the number of victories in the Senate was absolutely incredible and we did tele-rallies, we did tele-rallies with each one of them, and sometimes we did two or three for, and it was amazing to look at all of those victories. Nobody expected that. Nobody. So I just wanted to thank you very much for that, and we have, you have some great senators and some great new senators, and it also looks like we'll be keeping control of the House of Representatives. And I want to thank Mike Johnson , I think he's doing a terrific job. Terrific job.\n\n\"I want to also thank my beautiful wife Melania and First Lady, who has the number one bestselling book in the country, can you believe that? No, she has done a great job, works very hard, works very hard to help people. So I just want to thank her. But I want to thank my whole family, my amazing children, and they are amazing children, that we all think of our children. Everybody thinks, and children are amazing, but that's a good thing when you think they are. But Don, Eric, Ivanka, Tiffany, Barron. Lara, Jared, Kimberly, Michael. Thank you all. My father-in-law, Viktor, is tremendous and we miss very much Melania's mother, Amalija, we miss Amalija don't we, she would be very happy right now, standing on this stage, she'd be so proud. She was a great woman that one, beautiful inside and out. She was a great woman.\n\n\"I want to be the first to congratulate our great, now I can say, Vice-President-elect of the United States JD Vance , and his absolutely remarkable and beautiful wife, Usha Vance . And he is a feisty guy, isn't he? He and I have said, go into the enemy camp, and, you know, the enemy camp is certain networks and a lot of people don't like to, sir, do I have to do that? He just goes, OK, which ones, CNN , MSDNC, he'll say, all right, thank you very much, he actually looks like, he's like the only guy I've ever seen, he really looks forward to it. And then he just goes and absolutely obliterates them. Say a couple of words.\"\n\nJD Vance: \"Well, Mr. President, I appreciate you allowing me to join you on this incredible journey. I thank you for the trust that you placed in me, and I think that we just witnessed the greatest political comeback in the history of the United States of America. And under President Trump's leadership, we're never going to stop fighting for you, for your dreams, for the future of your children. And after the greatest political comeback in American history, we're going to lead the greatest economic comeback in American history under Donald Trump's leadership.\"\n\nDonald Trump: \"Thank you very much. He's, he's turned out to be a good choice. I took a little heat at the beginning, but he was I knew I knew the brain was a good one, about as good as it gets. And we love the family, and we're going to have a great four years, and we're gonna turn our country around. Make it something very special. It lost that, lost that little, it lost that little, that little thing called special. We have to make it, so we're gonna make this so great. It's gonna. It's the greatest country, and potentially the greatest country in the world by far and right now we're gonna just work very hard to get all of that back.\n\n\"We're gonna make it the best it's ever been. We can do that. We just, if we had to wait longer. I don't know. It was going bad and it was going bad fast. We're gonna have to seal up those borders, and we're gonna have to let people come into our country. We want people to come back in. But we have to, we have to let them come back in, but they have to come in legally. They have to come in legally. Let me also express my tremendous appreciation for Susie and Chris. The job you did. Susie, come. Susie, come here. Come, this is Chris. Come here, Chris. Susie likes to stay sort of in the back. Let me tell you, the ice baby. We call her the ice baby. Chris, come here, Chris. Susie likes to stay in the background. She's not in the background.\"\n\nChris LaCivita: \"This was unexpected, but I just want to thank, obviously, President Trump for this journey. It was a great one and he's a hell of a candidate and he's going to be a hell of a great 47th president and this team that we had the best team and of course, even my boss, Susie Wiles, the best. Thank you.\"\n\nDonald Trump: \"Thank you, and thank you, Susie. I've never seen her be shy before. Susie, they've been, they're great. Everybody up here is great. Everybody up here is very special. But what did you say? Oh, let me tell you, we have a new star. A star is born, Elon. No, he is. Now he's an amazing guy. We were sitting together tonight. You know, he spent two weeks in Philadelphia and different parts of Pennsylvania campaigning. You know, he sent the rocket up two weeks ago and I saw that rocket and I saw it coming down. I saw it. It was when it left. It was beautiful, shiny white. When it came down, it didn't look so pretty. It was going 10,000 miles an hour and it was burning like hell. I said, 'What happened to your paint job?' He said, 'We've never made a paint that could withstand that kind of heat.' And, but I saw it come down and turn around. And it was, you know, it's like 22 stories still, by the way, it looks a little smaller than that, but it's big. And it came down and down and you saw that fire burning and. And I'm saying only Elon could do this. It must be an Elon.\n\n\"And I tell the story I told it last night. I had a man on the phone. I had the screen muted, no sound. I was talking to a very important man. Happens to be here and that very important guy, one of the most important people in, I would say the country actually. But you know, I was president and now it looks like I was going to be maybe president again, so I figured I could ask him to hold. So I asked him to hold. And because, especially because you're gonna be president again, they hold. So I took the phone down and I'm looking the screen. I'm seeing this crazy thing that's going around and coming down. It looks like it's gonna crash into the gantry. And I said, 'Oh, no.' And I said, 'Do me a favor. Do you mind holding for a couple of? I want to see this.'\n\n\"I thought it was a Space Age movie or something. I put the phone down but I didn't pick it up for 45 minutes and he was holding. But this spaceship came down and I saw those engines firing and it looked like it was over. It was going to smash and then I saw the fire pour out from the left side and it put it straight. And it came down so gently and then it wrapped those arms around it. And it held it. And just like you hold your baby at night, your little baby. And it was a beautiful thing to see, and I called Elon, I said, 'Elon, was that you?' He said, 'Yes, it was.' I said, 'Who else can do that? Can Russia do it?' 'No.' 'Can China do it?'' No.' 'Can the United States do it? Other than you?' 'No, nobody can do that.' I said, 'That's why I love you, Elon, that.'\n\n\"And you know, when we had the tragic Hurricane Helene. And it hit it, particularly it hit North Carolina. They were really devastated. The water. This was big water. As big as we've ever seen, water hurricane. It built lakes out of nothing, fields became lakes. And the danger was unbelievable. And the people from North Carolina came to me and they said, 'Would it be possible at all possible for you to speak to Elon Musk , we need Starlink.' I said, 'What's Starlink?' It's a form of communication. So I called Elon. And I'll tell you what he had, and it was very dangerous. People would die. They had no communication. All the wires were down. I called Elon Musk. I said, 'Elon, you have something called Starlink. Is that right?' 'Yes, I do.' 'What the hell is it?' He said, 'It's a communication system that's very good.' I said, 'Elon, they need it really, really badly in North Carolina.' He got that there so fast. It was incredible. So, and it was great. It saved a lot of lives. He saved a lot of lives. But he's a character. He's a special guy. He's a super genius. We have to protect our geniuses. We don't have that many of them. We have to protect our super geniuses.\n\n\"I want to thank some of the, you know, we have up here today, the U.S. Open champion, he's fantastic. He'll be slightly longer than me. It's a bit, a little bit longer than me, just a little bit. Bryson DeChambeau is up here someplace. What happened to Preston? Where is he? Bryson. Oh. He's hitting balls. He's on the way. He's hitting balls. Bryson. Oh, look at him. He had a great, he's got a great career going, great U.S. Open. Bryson, that's a fantastic job. And we also have a man, Dana White, who has done some job. He's a tough guy. So Dana started UFC and came to me. 'Do you mind if I use your?' Nobody wanted to give him a ring because they said it's a rough sport, a little rough. And I helped him out a little bit and I went and they said, 'This is the roughest sport I've ever seen.' But I began to like it and he loved it, and nobody's done a better job in sports and you know, he's a very motivational kind of a guy. What he does, he gets these fighters and they they really go at it and it's become one of the most successful sports enterprises anywhere at any time doing so well, I'd like to ask Dana just to say a couple of words cause people love to hear from him.\"\n\nDana White: \"Nobody deserves this more than him, and nobody deserves this more than his family does. This is what happens when the machine comes after you. What you've seen over the last several years. This is what it looks like. Couldn't stop him. He keeps going forward. He doesn't quit. He's the most resilient, hardworking man I've ever met in my life. His family are incredible people. This is Karma, ladies and gentlemen. He deserves this. They deserve it as a family. I want to thank some people real quick. I want to thank the boys Adin Ross, Theo Von, Bussin' with the Boys. And last but not least, the mighty and powerful Joe Rogan . And thank you, America. Thank you. Have a good night.\"\n\nDonald Trump: \"Yes. That is a piece of work. Now he's an amazing, he's really an amazing guy, but most of all, I want to thank the millions of hard working Americans across the nation who have always been the heart and soul of this really great movement. We've been through so much together and today you showed up in record numbers to deliver a victory, really, really probably like no other. This was something. This was something special. And we're gonna. We're gonna pay you back. We're gonna do the best job, we're going, we're going to turn it around. It's got to be turned around. It's got to be turned around fast, and we're going to turn it around. We're going to do it in every way with so many ways, but we're going to do it in every way. This will forever be remembered as the day the American people regained control of their country.\n\n\"And, so I just want to say that on behalf of this great group of people, these are hardworking people, these are fantastic people and we can add a few names like Robert F Kennedy Jr. He came out. And he's going to help make America healthy again. And now he's a great guy and he really means it. He wants to do some things, and we're gonna let him go to it. I just said, 'But Bobby, leave the oil to me. We have more liquid gold, oil and gas. We have more liquid gold than any country in the world. More than Saudi Arabia. We have more than Russia. Bobby, stay away from the liquid gold. Other than that, go have a good time, Bobby.' We're gonna be paying down debt. We're gonna be reducing taxes. We have, we can do things that nobody else can do. Nobody else is gonna be able to do it. China doesn't have what we have. Nobody has what we have.\n\n\"But we have the greatest people also. Maybe that's the most important thing. This campaign, this campaign has been so historic in so many ways, we've built the biggest, the broadest, the most unified coalition. They've never seen anything like it in all of American history. They've never seen any. Young and old, men and women, rural and urban. And we had them all helping us tonight. When you think, I mean, I was looking at it. I was watching it. They had some great analysis of the people that voted for us. Nobody's ever seen anything like that. They came from, they came from all quarters. Union, nonunion, African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, Arab American, Muslim American, we had everybody and it was beautiful. It was a historic realignment. Uniting citizens of all backgrounds around a common core of common sense. You know, we're the party of common sense.\n\n\"We wanna have borders. We wanna have security. We wanna have things be good, safe. We want great education. We want, we want a strong and powerful military and ideally, we don't have to use it. You know, we had no wars four years. We had no wars. Except we defeated ISIS , we defeated ISIS in record time. And, but we had no wars. They said, 'He will start a war.' I'm not going to start a war. I'm going to stop wars. But this is also a massive victory for democracy and for freedom. Together, we're going to unlock America's glorious destiny. We're going to achieve the most incredible future for our people.\n\n\"Yesterday, as I stood at my last stop on the campaign trail, I'll never be doing a rally again, can you believe it? I think we've done 900 rallies approximately from. Can you imagine? 900, 901 or something. A lot of rallies. And it was sad. Everybody was sad. Many people. I said, 'This is our last rally,' but now we're going on to something that's far more important because the rallies were used for us to put, be put in this position where we can really help our country.\n\n\" That's what we're going to do. We're going to make our country better than it ever has been. They said that many people have told me that God spared my life for a reason. And that reason was to save our country and to restore America to greatness. And now we are going to fulfill that mission together. We're gonna fulfill that mission. The task before us will not be easy, but I will bring every ounce of energy, spirit, and fight that I have in my soul, to the job that you've entrusted to me.\n\n\"This is a great job that, there is no job like this. This is the most important job in the world. Just as I did in my first term, we had a great first term, a great, great first term. I will govern by a simple motto: Promises made, promises kept. We're going to keep our promises. Nothing will stop me from keeping my word to you, the people. We will make America safe, strong, prosperous, powerful, and free again.\n\n\" And I'm asking every citizen all across our land to join me in this noble and righteous endeavor. That's what it is. It's time to put the divisions of the past four years behind us. It's time to unite, and we're gonna try. We're gonna try. We have to try. And it's gonna happen. Success will bring us together. I've seen that. I've seen that. I saw that in the first term, when we became more and more successful, people started coming together. Success is going to bring us together and we are going to start by all putting America first.\n\n\"We have to put our country first for at least a period of time. We have to fix it. Because together we can truly make America great again for all Americans. So I want to just tell you what a great honor this is. I want to thank you. I will not let you down. America's future will be bigger, better, bolder, richer, safer and stronger than it has ever been before. God bless you and God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.\" [Walks off stage to YMCA].\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nFlynn Nicholls is a Newsweek reporter based in London, U.K. His focus is reporting on U.S. politics and society.

      "text": "Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration Speech: Read the Full Manuscript Here\n\nKatherine Fung is a Newsweek senior reporter based in New York City. She has covered U.S. politics and culture extensively. Katherine joined Newsweek in 2020. She is a graduate of the University of Western Ontario and obtained her Master's degree from New York University. You can get in touch with Katherine by emailing k.fung@newsweek.com . Languages: English\n\nBased on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.\n\nNewsweek AI is in beta. Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nPresident Donald Trump declared the beginning of \"the golden age of America\" in his inauguration address Monday, vowing to carry out many of the promises he made on the campaign trail.\n\nTrump was sworn into office for the second time in history this morning. He is the second president to have left office and returned for a second non-consecutive term. Prior to Trump's 2024 victory, Democrat Grover Cleveland was the only president to have done so.\n\nTrump's return to the White House also comes after a dramatic exit exactly four years ago, when he refused to accept the results of his 2020 defeat and to assist in the transfer of power to Joe Biden . Although Trump skipped Biden's inauguration on January 20, 2021-making him the first outgoing president to defy the tradition in 150 years, Biden did attend Trump's ceremony on Monday.\n\n\"Vice President Vance, Speaker Johnson, Senator Thune, Chief Justice Roberts, Justices of the United States Supreme Court, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, President Biden, Vice President Harris and my fellow citizens, the golden age of America begins right now.\n\nFrom this day forward, our country will flourish and be respected again all over the world. We will be the envy of every nation, and we will not allow ourselves to be taken advantage of any longer. During every single day of the Trump administration, I will very simply put America first. Our sovereignty will be reclaimed, our safety will be restored. Scales of justice will be rebalanced. The vicious, violent and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department and our government will end.\n\nOur top priority will be to create a nation that is proud, prosperous and free. America will soon be greater, stronger and far more exceptional than ever before.\n\nI return to the presidency confident and optimistic that we are at the start of a grilling, new era of national success. A tide of change is sweeping the country. Sunlight is pouring over the entire world, and America has the chance to seize this opportunity like never before, but first, we must be honest about the challenges we face.\n\nWhile they are plentiful, they will be annihilated by this great momentum that the world is now witnessing in the United States of America. As we gather today, our government confronts a crisis of trust. For many years, a radical and corrupt establishment has extracted power and wealth from our citizens while the pillars of our society lay broken and seemingly in complete disrepair. We now have a government that cannot manage even a simple crisis at home, while at the same time stumbling into a continuing catalog of catastrophic events abroad. It fails to protect our magnificent law abiding American citizens, but provide sanctuary and protection for dangerous criminals, many from prisons and mental institutions that have illegally entered our country from all over the world. We have a government that has given unlimited funding to the defense of foreign borders but refuses to defend American borders, or, more importantly, its own people.\n\nOur country can no longer deliver basic services in times of emergency, as recently shown by the wonderful people of North Carolina who were treated so badly. And other states who are still suffering from a hurricane that took place many months ago. Or more recently, Los Angeles, where we're watching fires still tragically burn. But weeks ago, without even a token of defense, they're raging through the houses and communities, even affecting some of the wealthiest and most powerful individuals in our country, some of whom are sitting here right now. They don't have a home any longer. That's interesting.\n\nWe can't let this happen. Everyone is unable to do anything about it. That's going to change. We have a public health system that does not deliver in times of disaster, yet, more money is spent on it than any country anywhere in the world. And we have an education system that teaches our children to be ashamed of themselves, in many cases, to hate our country, despite the love that we try so desperately to provide to them. All of this will change starting today, and it will change very quickly.\n\nMy recent election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal and all of these many betrayals that have taken place and to give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy and indeed, their freedom. From this moment on, America's decline is over.\n\nOur liberties and our nation's glorious destiny will no longer be denied, and we will immediately restore the integrity, competency and loyalty of America's government. Over the past eight years, I have been tested and challenged more than any president in our 250 year history, and I've learned a lot along the way. The journey to reclaim our republic has not been an easy one, that I can tell you. Those who wish to stop our cause have tried to take my freedom and indeed to take my life just a few months ago. In a beautiful Pennsylvania field, an assassin's bullet ripped through my ear, but I felt, then and believe, even more so now that my life was saved for a reason. I was saved by God to make America great again.\n\nThat is why, each day, under our administration of American patriots, we will be working to meet every crisis with dignity and power and strength. We will move with purpose and speed to bring back hope, prosperity, safety and peace, for citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed. For American citizens, January, 20, 2025, is Liberation Day.\n\nIt is my hope that our recent presidential election will be remembered as the greatest and most consequential election in the history of our country. As our victory showed, the entire nation is rapidly unifying behind our agenda, with dramatic increases in support from virtually every element of our society. Young and old, men and women, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, urban, suburban, rural and very importantly, we had a powerful win in all seven swing states. And the popular vote, we won by millions of people.\n\nTo the Black and Hispanic communities, I want to thank you for the tremendous outpouring of love and trust that you have shown me with your vote. We set records, and I will not forget it. I've heard your voices in the campaign, and I look forward to working with you in the years to come. Today is Martin Luther King Day, and his honor, this will be a great honor, but in his honor, we will strive to together to make his dream a reality. We will make his dream come true.\n\nThe National unit is now returning to America, and confidence and pride is soaring like never before. In everything we do, my administration will be inspired by a strong pursuit of excellence and unrelenting success. We will not forget our country. We will not forget our Constitution, and we will not forget our God.\n\nToday, I will sign a series of historic executive orders. With these actions, we will begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense. All of that common sense.\n\nFirst, I will declare a national emergency at our southern border. All illegal entry will immediately be holding and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came. We will reinstate my 'Remain in Mexico' policy. I will end the practice of catch and release and I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country.\n\nUnder the orders I signed today, we will also be designating the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. And by invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to U.S. soil, including our cities and inner cities.\n\nAs commander in chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions, and that is exactly what I am going to do. We will do it at a level that nobody has ever seen before.\n\nNext, I will direct all members of my cabinet to marshal the vast powers at their disposal to defeat what was record inflation and rapidly bring down costs and prices. The inflation crisis was caused by massive overspending and escalating energy prices, and that is why today, I will also declare a national energy emergency. We will drill, baby, drill.\n\nAmerica will be manufacturing nation once again. And we have something that no other manufacturing nation will ever have, the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on earth. And we are going to use it. We're going to use it. We will bring prices down, fill our strategic reserves up again, right to the top, and export American energy all over the world.\n\nWe will be a rich nation again, and it is that liquid gold under our feet that will help to do it. With my actions today, we will end the green new deal, and we will revoked the electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto industry, and keeping my sacred pledge to our great American autoworkers. In other words, you'll be able to buy the car of your choice. We will build automobiles in America again at a rate that nobody could have dreamt possible just a few years ago. And thank you to the auto workers of our nation for your inspiring vote of confidence. We did tremendously with their vote.\n\nI will immediately begin the overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers and families. Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens.\n\nFor this purpose, we are establishing the External Revenue Service to collect all tariffs, duties and revenues. It will be massive amounts of money pouring into our T reasury coming from foreign sources. The American dream will soon be back and thriving like never before. To restore competence and effectiveness to our federal government, my administration will establish the brand new Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nAfter years and years of illegal and unconstitutional federal efforts to restrict free expression, I will also sign an executive order to immediately stop all government censorship and bring back free speech to America. Never again will the immense power of the state be weaponized to persecute political opponents, something I know something about. We will not allow that to happen. It will not happen again under my leadership. We will restore fair, equal and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law, and we are going to bring law and order back to our cities.\n\nThis week, I will also end the government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life. We will forge a society that is colorblind and merit-based. As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female.\n\nThis week, I will reinstate any service members who were unjustly expelled from our military for objecting to the COVID vaccine mandate with full back pay. And I will sign an order to stop our warriors from being subjected to radical political theories and social experiments, while on duty. It's going to end immediately. Our armed forces will be freed to focus on their sole mission: defeating America's enemies.\n\nLike in 2017, we will again build the strongest military the world has ever seen. We will measure our success, not only by the battles we win, but also by the wars that we end, and perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into.\n\nMy proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier. That's what I want to be, a peacemaker and a unifier. I'm pleased to say that as of yesterday, one day before I assumed office, the hostages in the Middle East are coming back home to their families.\n\nAmerica, will reclaim its rightful place as the greatest, most powerful, most respected nation on earth, inspiring the awe and admiration of the entire world. A short time from now, we are going to be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, and we will restore the name of a great President William McKinley to Mount McKinley, where it should be and where it belongs.\n\nPresident McKinley made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent. He was a natural businessman, and gave Teddy Roosevelt the money for many of the great things he did, including the Panama Canal, which has foolishly been given to the country of Panama, after the United States--The United States. I mean, think of this, spent more money than ever, spent on a project before and lost 38,000 lives in the building of the Panama Canal. We have been treated very badly from this foolish gift that should have never been made, and Panama's promise to us has been broken. The purpose of our deal and the spirit of our treaty has been totally violated. American ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form, and that includes the United States Navy, and above all, China is operating the Panama Canal, and we didn't give it to China. We gave it to Panama and we're taking it back.\n\nAbove all, my message to Americans today is that it is time for us to once again act with courage, vigor and the vitality of history's greatest civilization. So as we liberate our nation, we will lead it to new heights of victory and success. We will not be deterred. Together, we will end the chronic disease epidemic and keep our children safe, healthy and disease-free. The United States will once again consider itself a growing nation, one that increases our wealth, expands our territory, builds our cities, raises our expectations and carries our flag into new and beautiful horizons, and we will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars, launching American astronauts to plant the stars and stripes on the planet Mars.\n\nYou ambition is the lifeblood of a great nation, and right now, our nation is more ambitious than any other. There's no nation like our nation. Americans are explorers, builders, innovators, entrepreneurs and pioneers. The spirit of the frontier is written into our hearts. The call of the next great adventure resounds from within our souls. Our American ancestors turned a small group of colonies on the edge of a vast continent into a mighty republic of the most extraordinary citizens on earth. No one comes close. Americans push thousands of miles through a rugged land of untamed wilderness. They cross deserts, scaled mountains, braved untold dangers, won the Wild West, ended slavery, rescued millions from tyranny, lifted billions from poverty, harnessed electricity, split the atom, launched mankind into the heavens and put the universe of human knowledge into the palm of the human hand.\n\nIf we work together, there is nothing we cannot do and no dream we cannot achieve.\n\nMany people thought it was impossible for me to stage such a historic political comeback. But as you see today, here I am. The American people have spoken. I stand before you now as proof that you should never believe that something is impossible to do. In America, the impossible is what we do best,\n\nFrom New York to Los Angeles, from Philadelphia to Phoenix, from Chicago to Miami, from Houston to right here in Washington, DC, our country was forged and built by the generations of patriots who gave everything they had for our rights and for our freedom. They were farmers and soldiers, cowboys and factory workers, steel workers and coal miners, police officers and pioneers who pushed onward, marched forward and let no obstacle defeat their spirit or their pride. Together, they laid down, the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, built great highways, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and triumphed over every single challenge that they face. After all we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the four greatest years in American history.\n\nWith your help, we will restore America's promise, and we will rebuild the nation that we love, and we love it so much. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation, under God. So to every parent who dreams for their child, and every child who dreams for their future, I am with you. I will fight for you. And I will win for you. We are going to win like never before.\n\nIn recent years, our nation has suffered greatly, but we are going to bring it back and make it great again, greater than ever before. We will be a nation like no other, full of compassion, courage and exceptionalism. Our power will stop all wars and bring a new spirit of unity to a world that has been angry, violent and totally unpredictable. America will be respected again and admired again, including by people of religion, faith and good will. We will be prosperous, we will be proud, we will be strong, and we will win like never before. We will not be conquered, we will not be intimidated, we will not be broken, and we will not fail.\n\nFrom this day on, the United States of America will be a free, sovereign and independent nation. We will stand bravely. We will live proudly. We will dream boldly and nothing will stand in our way because we are Americans. The future is ours and our Golden Age has just begun. Thank you. God bless America.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nKatherine Fung is a Newsweek senior reporter based in New York City.

      "text": "Americans Aren't Nostalgic for the Past. They Are Nostalgic for Being 15.\n\nPolitics\n\nEric Boehm | 5.29.2024 1:52 PM\n\nDonald Trump's presidential campaign famously promises to \"Make America Great Again.\" As a rule, no one should think too hard about the meaning of bumper sticker political slogans. But ever since Trump rolled it out nine years ago, his slogan has quietly asked some seemingly unanswerable questions: When was America great before? And when did that greatness vanish, thus necessitating its recovery?\n\nThe answer, it turns out, isn't a year. It's an age.\n\nAnd that age is roughly when you were between 11 and 16 years old-regardless of when you were born. Across generations, Americans seem to believe that the best music, the best television, the top sporting events, and the strongest communities are the ones they experienced in their adolescence and early teen years. That's the conclusion drawn by the data crunchers at The Washington Post , who distilled some fascinating recent polling data from YouGov's survey of Americans' views about different decades.\n\n\"The good old days when America was 'great' aren't the 1950s,\" writes the Post 's Andrew Van Dan. \"They're whatever decade you were 11, your parents knew the correct answer to any question, and you'd never heard of war crimes tribunals, microplastics, or improvised explosive devices. Or when you were 15 and athletes and musicians still played hard and hadn't sold out.\"\n\nThe charts in the Post 's analysis are striking: Across music, movies, fashion, and other social measures, Americans seem to believe that culture peaked roughly one to two decades after they were born and has declined since. The Post and YouGov polling data fits with what other researchers have found: that humans have the strongest sense of nostalgia for the culture we experienced between the ages of 17 and 23 .\n\nIt's not difficult to deduce why. Those are our formative years, rich with new experiences and potential, in which most of us had few serious responsibilities and got to enjoy the safety of having others provide for our basic needs.\n\nOn its own, there is nothing wrong with having golden-tinged memories of those years. Do I still love a lot of music from the late 90s and early 2000s simply because I was born in 1987, even though I can admit that some of it is objectively pretty terrible? Damn right, I do.\n\nBut letting nostalgia get mixed up in politics is not a great idea, in part because it's obviously a false promise . Sorry, but no matter how hard you vote, you're never going to be 15 again.\n\nUnfortunately, personal disillusionment is not the most serious problem created by nostalgia politics. As former Reason editor in chief Virginia Postrel explained in The Future and Its Enemies , many of the clashes that erupt in modern politics and culture are the result of a conflict between the forces of \"stasis\" and \"dynamism.\" Her book remains a powerful argument in favor of letting messy markets work and embracing the improvements that will come from an unknown future-and I'm not just saying that because it came out in 1998.\n\nIt seems like nostalgia-influenced politics plays into the hands of the former group, which would prefer a world more strictly controlled, with less creativity and change. That shows up most obviously in Trump's slogan, of course, but also in many other policies pushed by both major parties these days: limiting immigration, restricting development, protecting domestic industries from foreign competition, and so on. It is unfortunately a quick jump from \"I wish the world would be more like how I remember it when I was younger\" to giving the state more power over your freedom and the freedom of others.\n\nBy all means, re-watch those old television shows for the hundredth time. Buy tickets to go see those washed-up rock stars on tour this summer. Just keep your sense of nostalgia out of the voting booth and the public square.\n\nYou'll never be 15 again, but please don't ruin the future for the people who aren't 15 yet.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Republicans Upset by Trump's Conviction Should Embrace Criminal Justice Reform\n\nDonald Trump\n\nSteven Greenhut | 6.14.2024 7:45 AM\n\nAs a general rule in politics and public policy, I'd suggest applying one's principles as consistently as possible. It's hard to be taken seriously if, say, you want the feds to prosecute your political opponents on some ill-defined charges-and then complain about the \"weaponization\" of the justice system when you or your allies are in the dock. Just saying.\n\nOne of my oft-stated warnings for those, on the Left or Right, who advocate for new laws, more regulation, and broader powers for police agencies: First consider how these powers might be wielded in the hands of your enemies. Many \"well-intentioned\" laws have been twisted in ways that the authors never envisioned. Sometimes the reasons are nefarious, other times the result of bureaucratic inertia .\n\nDuring the 1980s War on Drugs, the U.S. Department of Justice created civil asset forfeiture laws that empowered the government to grab the property of drug cartels. It quickly became a means for police agencies to steal cars and cash from ordinary Americans, many of whom had never been convicted of or accused of a crime. The criminal justice reform movement has been trying to reform those and other unjust laws for years, but governments are amazingly resistant to change.\n\nBut perhaps that movement is ready to welcome a large group of Americans who previously had shown little interest in the inner workings of the justice system. Now that former President Donald Trump is a convicted felon-and faces other state and federal charges in a variety of prosecutions -the Make America Great Again movement has suddenly discovered the evils of politicized prosecutions, inequities in the justice system, and fear of police abuse. MAGA hasn't gotten the requisite takeaways yet, so I'm spelling it out for them.\n\nBefore Trump showed up on the political scene, the nation was heading toward a new consensus about the criminal justice system. The forfeiture issue had become a bipartisan concern given its abuses . Liberal groups had long complained about police abuse, but prominent conservatives also came to realize that bad policing costs taxpayers a lot of money and undermines good policing. Incarceration levels and costs soared, which provided impetus for change.\n\nHowever, Trump's 2016 election polarized the electorate. The excesses of Black Lives Matter and \"defund the police\" hardened the battle lines, especially after protests and riots following George Floyd's death in Minneapolis. COVID-19 struck and crime rates increased. Conservatives went all in on \"backing the badge.\" We found ourselves in the same old place, with little room for bipartisan anything.\n\nTrump made matters worse with his rhetoric. There was the time he joked to a crowd of police officers that they shouldn't protect suspects' heads when putting them in squad cars. He denies it now, but Trump seemed to encourage crowds to chant \"lock her up\" referring to Hillary Clinton. It's hard to keep track of the number of officials MAGA supporters have wanted to lock up, with U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's (R-Ga.) comments to Anthony Fauci the latest example .\n\nThe Mueller report \"shows Mr. Trump trying to wield the power of law enforcement to target a political rival, a step that no president since Richard M. Nixon is known to have taken,\" The New York Times summarized . But that was then and this is now. With Trump feeling the sting of a jury (albeit after a local prosecution rather than a federal one) maybe his minions will rethink their inconsistency. Hope springs eternal.\n\nThe antidote to an allegedly political prosecution is to limit the ability of prosecutors to take novel and politicized readings of relevant statutes. The goal is to reduce their power so they can't do this to anyone, but Trump and his supporters just don't want it happening to them.\n\n\"Time for Red State AGs and DAs to get busy,\" posted U.S. Rep. Mike Collins (R-Ga.) on X, per an ABC News report . It pointed to other Trump supporters, including conservative commentator Charlie Kirk who called on Republicans to \"indict the left\" and Donald Trump Jr., who called on Republicans to \"fight fire with fire.\" It's almost as if they only care about justice when they are on the receiving end of it.\n\nA recent Reason column lamented the dissipation of justice reform in some Red States: \"Claiming to be responding to rising crime and the excesses of progressive reformers, several Republican-controlled state legislatures have not only reversed progress but also rolled back key reforms: increasing prison sentences, limiting parole and probation, restricting charities that pay bail for offenders, curtailing the discretion of local district attorneys and gutting civilian police oversight boards.\"\n\nSo, granted, there's no evidence whatsoever that Trump and MAGA want to reform the justice system and consistently address their concerns about the Trump prosecution. They seek revenge following the travails of their Dear Leader. But there's always time to learn the right lessons. When they do, I'll be the first one to welcome them into the criminal justice reform fold.\n\nThis column was first published in The Orange County Register.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "How is Donald Trump Going to Make America Great Again If His Supporters Are a Bunch of Losers?\n\nDonald Trump\n\nEd Krayewski | 10.26.2015 8:41 AM\n\nI saw an interesting tweet from Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump this weekend, about how Ben Carson, Jeb Bush, and Marco Rubio were \"VERY weak on illegal immigration\" and how the \"country will be overrun!\" because of it. It's nothing new rhetoric-wise for Trump, who appears to have made the calculated decision that adopting an anti-immigration stance would provide the largest return on investment on the campaign trail.\n\nA few years ago a Republican political operative told me that illegal immigration gets Republican base voters even more animated than the war on terror. Defending immigrants, in other words, was even riskier than defending civil liberties against the war on terror.\n\nWhat was particularly interesting to me about the tweet was the formulation-that the U.S. would be \"overrun\" by immigrants. And? If the U.S. were overrun by immigrants interested in taking jobs, what exactly is wrong with that? It seems it would comport to Trump's goal of \"making America great again.\"\n\nFrom the beginning of American history, immigration has made the country \"great.\" Thomas Paine, who wrote Common Sense , a treatise that probably did more than any other to radicalize the colonists in favor of the cause of independence in the 1770ss. Paine arrived to the colonies as an immigrant from England, in 1774, and Common Sense was published less than two years later. The wave of immigration at the turn of the 20th century helped propel the United States ahead of European powers economically and politically.\n\nImmigration in the 21st century can do the same, if the United States government got out of the way of peaceful people trying to enter the country and the employers who want to hire them. The idea that immigrants are a burden on the welfare system is a persistent but wholly inaccurate myth .\n\nThe wonderful thing about Twitter is it lets people engage with political, thought, cultural, and other \"leaders,\" without the professional media or handlers getting in the way. I tweeted a quip at Trump about how these immigrants overrunning the country could actually \"make America great again,\" Trump's campaign catch phrase. Donald Trump has probably not read it, but a bunch of his supporters have, and yesterday I got a flurry of tweets about how the border had to be secured so that American jobs would be secured.\n\nThe \"national security\" aspect of the push for a \"secure border\" isn't what animated the anti-immigration crowd as much as the fear that \" they took our jobs .\" This is also wholly inaccurate-immigrant workers don't displace the native-born. Even more, they help native workers be more productive.\n\nIf national security and the war on terror got Republican base voters as hot and bothered as immigration does, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) would be doing a lot better. He promises to crush ISIS and all terrorists, but he also believes the U.S. should, more or less, welcome immigration.\n\nDonald Trump wants to \"make America great again,\" but his campaign is based on exploiting the fears of people who believe they're entitled to more from the U.S. economy than they're getting, people who believe they are not doing as well as they could be not because of any personal failings or a lack of a sufficient work ethic or just hard luck, but because the border isn't secure and so the illegal immigrants are taking the good-paying job the average Trump supporter would have.\n\nI'm not one to call anyone a loser, but Donald Trump is, and it's hard to imagine he doesn't realize that's what many of his supporters are.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "J.D. Vance Completes Trump's Ideological Takeover of the Republican Party\n\nElection 2024\n\nMatt Welch | 7.16.2024 10:15 AM\n\nThere is an old political critique of Donald Trump, perhaps understandable, that the 45th and favored 47th president of the United States has no ideology , that the Republican turned independent turned Democrat turned Republican turned independent turned Republican is an incoherent and opportunistic ragbag of selfish impulses and populist punchlines.\n\nBut Trump's selection Monday of 39-year-old Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) to be his 2024 vice presidential running mate cements an alternative reality that many have been slow to recognize: \"Make America Great Again\" is no longer-if it ever was-just a slogan on a hat, but rather a decadelong philosophical transformation of the Republican Party from rhetorical proponent of free markets, entitlement reform, and Pax Americana to protector of the entitlement state against immigration and the working class against the globe-straddling corruption of elites.\n\nAsked Monday night at the Republican National Convention (RNC) by Fox News host Sean Hannity about his readiness to step into the presidency if need be, Vance said \"I have the vision and the agenda aligned with President Trump to make the American worker better off, bring peace to the world, and to actually advance the agenda that's good for American citizens....As successful as he was politically, even after he was elected, certain Republicans didn't want to actually enact the America First agenda.\"\n\nMany commentators over the past day have stressed this loyalty aspect, never failing to point out Vance's harsh 2016 words for Trump , back when he was still a celebrated young author and not a United States senator. But Vance's Hillbilly Elegy was, if not exactly a Trump 2016 blueprint (having come out only that summer), a harbinger of a new type of Republican political emphasis, focusing on blue-collar dysfunction and the plight of the forgotten man.\n\nThe GOP's new work clothes were on startling display during Monday night's keynote RNC speech , by International Brotherhood of Teamsters President Sean O'Brien. Watching star-spangled delegates enthusiastically cheer on a union boss stumping against right-to-work laws, bashing Amazon and the Chamber of Commerce, and decrying \"American workers being sold out to big banks, big tech corporations, [and] the elite,\" well, this is not your father's (or grandfather's) Republican convention.\n\nAs political pollster and author Patrick Ruffini argued to Nick Gillespie in March , Trump has been the primary change agent in a realignment of America's two major political parties. \"Specifically, it flipped after 2016,\" Ruffini said, \"when Democrats really seemed to [begin to] have a lot of trouble holding on to the broad mass of working-class voters, which are today defined as voters without college degrees.\"\n\nThe Vance pick is a transparent attempt to lock in those gains. \"I think he has working-class appeal,\" Trump ally Roger Stone told USA Today . Trump in his Truth Social announcement praised the senator for championing \"the hardworking men and women of our Country.\"\n\nWhile some of the working-class partisan shift is more about culture and vibes-as Ruffini put it, Trump's new fans \"saw a certain authenticity, and they saw somebody who spoke like them, somebody who was angry at the same people that they were angry at\"-there are concrete policy implications as well.\n\nVance is perhaps the GOP's leading practitioner of responding to questions about Russia's invasion of Ukraine by pivoting to Mexico and fentanyl. \"What are we talking about?\" he asked at a voter forum in February 2022 as the invasion was imminent. \"We're talking about a border 5,000 miles away between Ukraine and Russia. That's what our leaders are focused on. If we had leaders half as concerned about their own border as they were about the Ukraine-Russia border, we would not have a border crisis in this country.\"\n\nThis aspect of Trump's GOP was also on display Monday in Milwaukee, particularly in the awkward speech of technology investor David Sacks. President Joe Biden, Sacks proclaimed, \"provoked-yes, provoked-the Russians to invade Ukraine with talk of NATO expansion.\" The result: \"Russia's military is bigger than before, while our own stockpiles are dangerously depleted. Every day, there are new calls for escalation, and the world looks on in horror as Joe Biden's demented policy takes us to the brink of World War III.\"\n\nAgain, this is not your father's GOP.\n\nVance, as Reason 's Robby Soave detailed last week, is a proponent of raising the minimum wage, banning TikTok, and enacting some form of national service. The would-be veep \"embraces tariffs and protectionism . He has called for the federal government to break up Google. He has even praised Federal Trade Commission Chairwoman Lina Khan, a Joe Biden appointee waging a one-woman crusade against major tech companies-and indirectly, their customers .\"\n\nOn some of these issues, Vance has struck an even more America First position than the man who repopularized that political slogan. Which underlines the point: Unlike some of his competitors in the veepstakes, such as Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Vance is more of a true believer, or at least sincere-seeming transmitter, of that collection of policy impulses we might call Trumpism.\n\nIn that, the GOP presidential nominee is displaying some ideological confidence. \"Balancing\" the ticket? No, Trump is, as Reason 's Stephanie Slade observed Monday, \" doubling down .\" Selecting an articulator of MAGA half his age will help Trump accomplish what few people could have ever predicted in July 2015: Change the meaning of the word \"Republican\" for an entire generation. Trump may or may not make America great again, but he sure is making the GOP nationalist.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "It Didn't Start With Trump\n\nDonald Trump\n\nBrian Doherty | 6.18.2024 7:00 AM\n\nWhen the Clock Broke: Con Men, Conspiracists, and How America Cracked Up in the Early 1990s , by John Ganz, Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 432 pages, $30\n\nWhen the Clock Broke , by the progressive essayist John Ganz, is a solidly educational and entertaining work of political history. While Ganz winningly doesn't bash you over the head page by page with the larger point he's trying to make, the stories he chooses to tell about the early 1990s are meant to hit home how elements of American political, cultural, economic, and ideological life back then laid the groundwork for Donald Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" (MAGA) movement today.\n\nHis title derives from an obscure 1992 speech by a figure most progressive readers have likely never heard of: the libertarian-movement founding father and gadfly Murray Rothbard, an economist who also explored political philosophy and history as he built a case for a totally stateless society.\n\nMost libertarians' amour-propre might be wounded seeing their movement fingered as having meaningfully paved the way for Trumpism. But in May, the management of the Libertarian Party, dominated by a caucus that sees itself in the Rothbardian tradition, invited former President Donald Trump to speak at their presidential nominating convention, where he tried to make the case that their votes rightfully belonged to him. Whether or not it makes philosophical sense, there is something to Ganz's attempts to link anarcho-capitalist Rothbard with big-state caudillo Trump.\n\nMAGA does at times seem to wear the mantle of smash-the-state anarchism in its rage against the modern progressive state, though Trump's regime managed a state pretty much as big and intrusive as its predecessors' (except for some tax and regulation reductions that were GOP orthodoxy long before Trump). And the Rothbardians' state-hatred can make any punctiliousness about the institutions of democracy and peaceful change of power that Trump threatened seem besides the point: If the state is pure rapine and murder, who can get too upset about whether or not power is exchanged politely?\n\nSince most of this book about the tumult of the early 1990s has nothing to do with Rothbard or libertarianism, readers may wonder why they are hearing quite so much about things like what that eccentric economist in Las Vegas thought about Woody Allen's love life, or why his statement underlies the book's title. Ganz's choice here seems to imply that the clock-breaking Rothbard advocated actually happened .\n\nWhat Rothbard called for-in a talk to the John Randolph Club, a mixed gathering of libertarians and reactionaries-was to \"break the clock\" of \"social democracy...Great Society...welfare state...and New Deal.\" That clock-breaking obviously did not happen. The best one can say for such a thesis is that Rothbard in the last few years of his life-after his \"paleo\" turn led him to reject most of the libertarian movement and ally himself instead with Pat Buchanan-style conservatives-began dreaming of a Trumpian-styled right-populist champion on the horizon, one who would aggressively and with no politesse punch left-liberalism in the metaphorical nose. But When Obscure Agitators Who Wanted To Break the Clock Sounded Political Notes That Trump Later Magnified and Succeeded With isn't as catchy a title.\n\nRothbard and the paleos did accurately foresee something looming in American political culture that the libertarian comrades he left behind did not: that political success could be had by linking rhetorical anti-statism (about some things at least) with a gleefully rude appeal to white resentment.\n\nMore Trumpy than Rothbard were the other major characters in Ganz's narrative. Certainly, Buchanan's 1992 presidential campaign, detailed here at length, was a dry run for Trump, as were Buchanan's later books obsessed with defending the white European character of America by putting the brakes on immigration-though Buchanan was more conventionally educated in politics and economics than Trump is.\n\nAnother obscure writer whose story Ganz tells, Samuel Francis , presaged Trump in an almost eerily on-the-nose manner. Francis' columns in The Washington Times and Chronicles advocated an American right that was more open to bully-boy violence and even terror, more obsessed with closed borders, more furious at cultural elites, and more willing to use the government as a nationalist tool to prop up a white working-class constituency, reverse progressive cultural change, and tame \"woke\" corporations (long before that term was in use, of course).\n\nUnderlying Ganz's story is a narrative also believed by his ideological enemies on the nationalist right: that Reagan-era deregulation, deindustrialization, tax cuts, loosening of trade restrictions, and union-busting annihilated any chance for America's former middle classes to thrive, drove them insane, and led them to Trump.\n\nBut most evidence indicates that Trump voters are driven more by cultural insecurities and resentments than by economic ones. Besides, Ganz's story of American economic life in its focus only on decline is misleading and overly pessimistic. His book gives the impression that from the early 1990s to Trump's rise, an unrelenting economic disaster settled over the American working man. In fact, from 1992 to 2016 per capita gross domestic product more than doubled , as did median personal income ; the median hourly wage nearly doubled; and while the homeownership rate declined, it did so by less than 1 percent (and was by 2023 nearly 2 percent above the 1992 rate). In that quarter century, more of the middle class disappeared into upper classes than tumbled into eternal penury, with the percentage of Americans in the lower middle class or poor shrinking by around 8 percent and the percentage in the upper middle class or rich going up by around 10 percent.\n\nThis is not to deny that there were individual voters who fell on the bad end of economic change or had other reasons to feel aggrieved. But it does blunt the idea that economic devastation explains Trump.\n\nThe bulk of Ganz's book tells the early-1990s stories of Jesse Jackson, Rush Limbaugh, Ross Perot, Bill Clinton, Daryl Gates, Randy Weaver, and John Gotti, drawing more or less convincing or interesting parallels between their activities then and Trumpian modernity. The Jackson chapter, with its focus on Bill Clinton's \"Sister Souljah\" moment, reminds us that in a pre-woke age even a liberal Democrat could sound tough on racial politics in a way that reads as MAGA now. The Limbaugh chapter highlights one clear aspect of Trump's appeal, as the paladin defending middle Americans who feel disrespected and mocked by those who control their culture and government. (Trump, Ganz demonstrates, is a walking embodiment of early-'90s right-wing talk radio.) The Gates chapter reminds us that in an era of far more prevalent crime than the one Trump portrayed as \"American carnage,\" worries about street crime didn't necessarily have a racial valence, as even many black citizens and leaders wanted tougher policing. (Not that this was the point Ganz was trying to make.)\n\nThe Perot chapter shows that many Americans (though not nearly an electoral majority) were already in the early 1990s hungry for a non-status-quo strongman and didn't care exactly how that would play out in policy terms. And the Gotti chapter, at the book's end, is intended to make the reader think of Trump as more organized crime figure than politician, wrapping up the narrative with a small frisson of fear about what might await America next year.\n\nThe 1990s are a fresh area for Ganz to make his writerly mark. But if you read Rick Perlstein's work on the American right in the 1970s (an obvious influence on Ganz in both style and intent, though Ganz can't quite pull off Perlstein's effortlessly delightful readability), you'll see there was nothing uniquely germinal in the '90s for the Trump movement. It was a longer time coming.\n\nRacial and ethnic resentment, revolutionary activity on the part of a tiny margin (with a larger audience of fascinated admirers), a conservative America that feels mocked and disrespected by an elite class, fear of clandestine government agencies, worries about the working class losing economic ground: They were not new in the Trump era, nor did they begin in the '90s. They are persistent parts of the modern American experience.\n\nWhile Ganz wants to blame free markets for destroying widespread American prosperity, as always, the path to consistently creating wealth (and eventually spreading it more evenly) lies in halting government practices that have slowed down wage growth and productivity, particularly barriers to practicing professions and creating businesses and building living spaces. As always, the most state-encrusted parts of the economy, such as health care and higher education, are the most sclerotic and expensive.\n\nAs Ganz makes clear, the fascist-adjacent philosophers that his villain Francis doted on, the likes of Georges Sorel and Vilfredo Pareto, tended to analyze all social issues and crises in terms of who has power and who they wield it against. This is the mindset that leads tribalists such as Francis to try to make the American right a more explicitly race-based operation, as well as one eager to use state power to crush its cultural enemies. In a multiracial, multiethnic republic-something that America will continue to be no matter how many immigration restrictions the right tries to impose-that's bad for peace and prosperity.\n\nGanz launches his book with the political saga of David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader who became a Louisiana state legislator from 1989 to 1992, a story that hits home how much the author centers racial conflict in the modern American story. Trump is certainly more circumspect on race issues than Duke. But to the extent that he and his epigones make politics more race-conscious, the worse things will get for America. The same goes for race-conscious Democrats.\n\nDespite Rothbard's embrace of right-wing populism in his declining years, the libertarian project he did so much to further for most of his career-the project of limiting and decentralizing power rather than frantically striving to use it against your perceived enemies-is all the more vital for civic peace and prosperity in the Trump and post-Trump eras.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "We Won't Make America Great Again by Scaring Off Foreign College Students\n\nImmigration\n\nNick Gillespie | 4.23.2019 10:45 AM\n\nAmerican colleges and universities have long been the most sought-after in the world, as judged by the number of foreign students who come to study here. About 20 percent of college students who study abroad choose a school in the United States. That's almost twice the percentage that choose somewhere in the United Kingdom, the second-most popular location.\n\nBut that corner of American greatness might be getting shut down. According to the Institute of International Education (IIE), between the academic years of 2016/17 and 2017/18, the number of new international students enrolling in U.S. colleges and universities dropped 6.3 percent for undergrads, 5.5 percent for grad students, and 9.7 percent for non-degree students. Overall, the drop was 6.6 percent and the total number of new international students (about 272,000) is down to levels last seen in 2013/14. The number of new enrollments peaked at 301,000 in 2015/16.\n\nAs the IIE notes, the decline in new students is offset a bit by the number of foreign students who participate in the \"Optional Practical Training (OPT) program, which allows international students to practice their skills in the United States for up to 12 months during or after they complete their academic programs, or up to 36 months for students who have earned a degree in STEM fields.\" If you factor in OPT folks, the number of international students increased overall by 1.5 percent between 2016/17 and 2017/18 (the last year for which there is data). But with fewer new students enrolling, there will be fewer graduates eligible for OPT down the road.\n\nWhy are foreign students, who mostly come from China (33 percent), India (18 percent), and South Korea (5 percent), bypassing the United States? Writing at Forbes , Stuart Anderson, the executive director of the National Foundation for American Policy, states that \"the Trump administration has made it more difficult for international students to stay or work in America.\" Among other things , the White House is working to reduce or eliminate the OPT program, has made it easier for international students to get deported due to clerical errors, and made it harder and more expensive to get an H-1B visa, which is the sort of work permit most international college grads need to stay in the country. And both President Trump and many in the Republican Party are pushing legislation that would reduce legal immigration by 50 percent.\n\nIt's not just students who are thinking twice about coming to America. As a friend of mine who runs a math department at a top-tier public university has told me, foreign-born faculty are also thinking twice about coming to a country in which immigration policy is becoming more restrictionist. So we're not just losing students who want to come here, but also faculty, researchers, and scholars.\n\nIn trying to \"Make America Great Again,\" Donald Trump and his allies are trying to reduce the number of foreign-born people living here. To the extent that they succeed, they will be making U.S. colleges and universities less desirable than they once were. Given declining birthrates and the outsized role immigrants play in starting new companies-foreign-born individuals comprise 15 percent of the labor force but are 25 percent of entrepreneurs who start new businesses-scaring off newcomers is a recipe for decline, not greatness.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

He even intimated that China may have interfered in the 2020 election because of how tough he had been on the country as president.\n\nMaking his run official, he declared \"We are a nation in decline,\" but that \"America's comeback starts right now.\"\n\nTrump has teased an announcement in some form or another since last May, barely three months after leaving office the first time. Many Republicans worried that if he announced before the midterms, it would hurt the party's chances by shifting focus to the controversial candidate.\n\nAs if to split the difference, the night before the midterms Trump promised a \"very big announcement\" a week later. In that sense, it's hard not to judge the announcement in the wake of a midterm election in which his party performed historically poorly, with his hand-picked candidates faring worst of all .\n\nThe former president's first term ended contentiously, with Trump insisting that he had been denied his rightful reelection victory. His continuous propagation of myths about election fraud led hundreds of his most ardent supporters to storm the Capitol building in an attempt to delay the certification of Joe Biden as president. To this day, Trump proclaims publicly that the 2020 election was \"rigged\" against him.\n\nTuesday's announcement came more than seven years after Trump announced his first run , in which he borrowed a phrase that would soon festoon red hats everywhere: \"Sadly, the American dream is dead...But if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and we will make America great again.\" In the same announcement, he proclaimed his opposition to trade deals and his affinity for tariffs, as well as his distaste for immigration from non-European nations-beliefs which unfortunately became policy in his administration . During his announcement, Trump bragged about those policies.\n\nIt's anybody's guess what a second Trump administration would look like, and plenty of doomsayers have already been speculating .

      "text": "Trump Makes Canada Free Again\n\nTariffs\n\nC. Jarrett Dieterle | 3.15.2025 7:00 AM\n\nThe ongoing trade imbroglio occasioned by President Donald Trump's aggressively tariff-forward policy stance is roiling global markets across industries. The alcohol sector is being particularly hard hit, as many industry watchers warned could happen in the event of Trump-initiated trade wars with the European Union, Mexico, and Canada.\n\nWhile the latest developments-including the president's threat earlier this week to impose a 200 percent tariff on European alcohol-are par for the course when it comes to the economic fallout of tariffs, Canada's retaliation to Trump's tariffs could cause long-term damage to American alcohol markets. Unique features of the Canadian system of alcohol regulation could dry up American alcohol sales within our northern neighbor's borders for decades.\n\nIn response to Trump's 25 percent tariff on Canadian goods, the Canadian government decided to pull all U.S. alcohol from the shelves of its provincial-run alcohol stores. Both the U.S. and Canada regulate alcohol at the sub-national level, but with a key difference: While most American liquor stores are privately owned (except in the remaining 17 retail control states ), all but two Canadian provinces rely on government-run liquor stores.\n\nGovernment-controlled alcohol stores are notoriously bad for freedom, but they prove surprisingly handy in an international trade dispute in which a country wants to inflict maximal pain on its neighbors. Having a system of government-owned stores allows entire swaths of Canada to effectively lock American alcohol out of the marketplace entirely. Rather than just making American whiskey 25 percent more expensive in Canada, it may no longer exist inside the country's marketplace.\n\nJack Daniels' CEO Lawson Whiting called Canada's move \"worse than a tariff because it's literally taking your sales away completely, removing our products on the shelves.\" Canada is currently the U.S. alcohol industry's number two export market , with the province of Ontario alone accounting for around $1 billion in American alcohol sales each year.\n\nThe impacts have already been immediate, with distilleries like Michter's in Louisville announcing $115,000 in canceled bourbon orders, while liquor giant Diageo is estimating losses of up to $200 million . Craft distilleries near the border-like those in Buffalo and Washington state -could suffer the most, given both their small size and their interconnectedness with the Canadian market.\n\nUp until recently, Canadian whiskey was losing market share to American bourbon within Canada's borders-a trend that one can now expect to reverse, as Canadian consumers rally around the flag in a bout of \"buy local\" boozy patriotism. (One Canadian brewery even debuted its \"Presidential Pack,\" which contains 1,461 beers, enough for the buyer to have one for each remaining day of the Trump administration).\n\nFor its part, Canada struggles under its own thicket of overly burdensome and competition-hampering domestic alcohol regulations. Predictions of a \" booze revolution \" are spreading across the country as calls increase for the Canadian government to liberalize the country's alcohol markets, as evidenced by the recent decision to remove internal alcohol trade barriers between provinces.\n\nWhile many Canadian craft alcohol producers bemoan the difficulty they face in getting their products carried in the provincial-run stores, that too may be poised to change with the advent of a renewed deregulatory ethos inside the country. As one Canadian micro-distiller put it : \"We happen to have a lot of shelf space right now. They've just removed all of these American spirits.\"\n\nThe alcohol trade wars are hurting America in the normal ways one would expect tariffs to, but they're also having the unintended consequence of focusing the minds of Canadian government officials to deregulate their own bad booze laws-which, while good news for Canada, will just hurt American producers even more.\n\nTrump promised to \"Make America Great Again,\" but the main effect of his tariff policies could actually be to Make Canada Free Again.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "How Joe Biden Plans to Use MAGA Against Republicans\n\nPlus: Trump's abortion comments reflect his third way. Will pro-lifers acquiesce?\n\nHappy Monday! Andrew's back from paternity leave today. He's thankful to his bosses for company policies that prioritize family, his newsletter colleagues for picking up the slack while he was out, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer for axing the Senate's longstanding dress code over the weekend to permit gym shorts and hoodies in the chamber. It's important to ease back into these things gradually.\n\nPresident Joe Biden can speak off the cuff in public remarks and occasionally wander off course, which at times muddles his message and upstages his intended headline.\n\nSo it was instructive Friday to hear two prominent members of the Biden campaign's national advisory board-Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Rep. Jennifer McClellan of Virginia-frame the president's reelection pitch in crisp, carefully scripted political prose. Warren spoke first during a morning video conference call with reporters, focusing on the economy. Next came McClellan, talking about abortion rights. Both Democrats had one thing in common: Each cast the 2024 contest as a battle between \"MAGA extremism\" and the good old fashioned American values of freedom and fairness.\n\n\"The contrast is sharp. MAGAnomics is about policies that cut taxes for the rich and pass along costs to working Americans, while Bidenomics is all about fighting to rebuild the economy from the bottom up and the middle out,\" Warren said. \"That's Bidenomics in action, building an economy that works, not just for the wealthy and well-connected, but an economy that works for everyone.  That's the progress the Republican presidential hopefuls are trying to reverse with MAGAnomics.\"\n\n\"The majority of women are concerned about the MAGA agenda to ban abortion and restrict reproductive freedom,\" McClellan added. \"During last year's midterms, the American people went to the polls and rejected MAGA Republicans' anti-choice positions and this year's elections in Virginia and the presidential race next year will be no different.\"\n\nMAGA, of course, is shorthand for \"Make America Great Again,\" the campaign slogan popularized by Donald Trump in 2016 and dusted off by the former president for use in his White House comeback bid. Biden has used \"MAGA\" with increasing frequency dating back to last year's midterm campaign. That election worked out quite well for Democrats, who held the Senate and governor's mansions in key battleground states and suffered only minimal losses in the House.\n\nListening to Warren and McClellan, it seems the president and his party intend to wield \"MAGA\" like a pejorative bludgeon. The aim is to bruise Trump, the frontrunner for the GOP nomination, and every other Republican on the ballot. As McClellan noted, this includes Republicans running in the upcoming, November 7 off-year legislative elections in Virginia, and all of the federal and state races taking place next year.\n\nDemocrats say they believe this strategy accomplishes several tasks. It undermines Trump and any other Republican running for president that might beat him in the primary by lumping them all in the same \"MAGA\" basket; and it divides traditional Republican voters uneasy about conservative populism from the MAGA contingent of the GOP base. In the months ahead, it might seem as though Democrats are using the moniker in their political messaging as much as, if not more than, Trump.\n\nIncidentally, Warren and McClellan signaled that Biden's reelection message will primarily draw a contrast with the Republicans on the economy-\"Bidenomics vs. MAGAnomics\"-and abortion rights. It may yet work. But at the moment, Biden is suffering through a late summer swoon of horrible polling. Trump is matching his successor, or beating him, in a raft of fresh polls testing a hypothetical rematch and now edges him in the RealClearPolitics average .\n\nSo if the contrast between Biden and \"MAGA\" this-or-that is so clear, and so favorable, why is the president in this position?\n\n\"First of all, it's early, and at this point, most people are not focused on the presidential election, they're focused on their everyday lives,\" McClellan said in response to a question from Dispatch Politics . \"But when we communicate to people about his record, about Bidenomics, about what's at stake in this election, we see those numbers move and I think we will see that here as well.\"\n\n\"I've never spent time paying much attention to polls,\" Warren added. \"What I pay attention to and what the American people pay attention to are the things that people accomplish and who they say they're fighting for. President Biden and Vice President [Kamala] Harris have already accomplished an enormous amount for the American people.\"\n\nDonald Trump expressed his new, third-way stance on abortion in perhaps the most emphatic way yet during a lengthy interview with NBC News' Kristen Welker , which aired Sunday on Meet the Press .\n\n\"Pro-life, look, just so you understand-it's pretty much 50/50. It's a 50/50 issue. Amazing,\" the former president said. \"I was able to do something which gave at least pro-life people a voice. Now it's going to work out. Now the number of months will be determined. ... I'm going to come together with all groups, and we're going to have something that's acceptable.\"\n\nIt was already clear, in the wake of the 2022 midterm elections, that the honeymoon between Trump and the anti-abortion movement was over. Trump had awkwardly but enthusiastically embraced pro-lifers in his 2016 run and often billed himself as the most pro-life president in history, a claim he backed up by appointing three Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade . But when Republican abortion restrictions sparked a major electoral backlash last year, Trump adopted a new posture, which could be summarized like this: I delivered for pro-lifers, and now they should be happy with what they've got.\n\nThat view permeated his interview with Welker. If reelected president, would Trump be willing to sign a 15-week federal ban? \"I would sit down with both sides and I'd negotiate something, and we'll end up with peace on that issue for the first time in 52 years.\"\n\nTrump may have been vague on what he wants, but he was specific on what he considers too much: The early bans passed in recent years by the likes of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. \"I mean, DeSantis is willing to sign a five-week and six-week ban,\" Trump said. \"I think what he did is a terrible thing and a terrible mistake.\"\n\nThe response from some pro-life activists and social conservatives was harsh.\n\n\"When a leader doesn't have convictions on the most basic right of all, the right to #Life, this is what you get. Ugh. The 'let's make a deal' message isn't a win for babies,\" wrote Iowa conservative activist Bob Vander Plaats on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.\n\nThe editors of National Review called Trump's comments \"terrible\" and said \"he hasn't given the matter a moment's thought\" about his post- Roe abortion policy.\n\nOthers were more muted, including a statement from Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of SBA Pro-Life America, when asked by The Dispatch about Trump's comments on Meet the Press .\n\n\"We're at a moment where we need a human rights advocate, someone who is dedicated to saving the lives of children and serving mothers in need. Every single candidate should be clear on how they plan to do that. It begins with focusing on the extremes of the other side, and ambition and common sense on our own. Anything later than a 15 week protection for babies in the womb (when science proves they can feel pain) as a national minimum standard makes no sense,\" reads the statement.\n\nThe statement notably does not call out Trump directly, though a second statement provided to The Dispatch praises Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for signing into law the heartbeat bill Trump criticized.\n\nWill any of it matter for Trump in a Republican primary in which he remains far ahead of DeSantis or any other rival? It's worth remembering that earlier this year, Dannenfelser's organization went after Trump for the former president's preference that abortion be decided exclusively at the state level. \"Holding to the position that it is exclusively up to the states is an abdication of responsibility by anyone elected to federal office,\" Dannenfelser said at the time in a statement.\n\nWeeks later, Dannenfelser met with Trump , calling their discussion \"terrific.\"\n\n\"Everything he says is, like, a lie. It's terrible. Even his handicap in golf. He said he's a six-he's not a six.\"\n\n-Former President Donald Trump on President Joe Biden to Kristen Welker on Meet the Press , September 17, 2023\n\nDavid M.

      "text": "Dashed Hopes of Common Sense\n\nRepublicans are copying a left they profess to hate.\n\nAudio versions are only available to subscribers of The Dispatch. Join Today ! to listen to this post.\n\nFrom its emergence, \"Make America Great Again\" has doubled as a nostalgic call to action and a promise for a dramatic course correction. Its proponents vow to rectify the wrongdoings of successive political generations: to reclaim a set of American principles that the alleged villains of the leftist elite have either corrupted, forgotten, or willingly abandoned.\n\nMany who dreaded the unprincipled, brutish chaos of Trump & Co. nevertheless acknowledged the existence of the issues he shouted about. Even if he described them with typical unmeasured vulgarity, Trump wasn't wrong to identify a southern border dysfunctional enough to no longer resemble a border, an abandonment of common sense in favor of a professed sensitivity to ever more obscure identity groups, and an illiberal policing of thought and language in leading cultural and even medical institutions. The left tacitly justified its overreach by fixating on the incorrigible sins of America, often listed from seats of cultural privilege by those who most benefit from America's virtues.\n\nThere were, in other words, some issues to be dealt with, some balance to be redressed, some pendulum that needed to begin its oppositional swing. For many American voters, the Democratic leadership refused to sufficiently name the scale of the problem, either because they were unwilling to implicate themselves in its creation, or because they were unwilling to run afoul of the set-menu orthodoxy on immigration, race, gender, and history that their own fringe demanded.\n\nSome tentatively hoped that even with Trump at the helm, MAGA's diagnosis of voters' discontent-which Democrats still couldn't get a handle on-was at least broadly accurate enough to lead to some positive changes. At this point in the administration's tenure, however, such hope recedes and a grimmer reality appears. Its most unsettling feature is not Trump being Trump-his rashness, instability, and torching of norms are all playing out as promised-but the fact that a movement built on decrying the existential threat of leftist activism expects us to believe that unchecked activism from its own side will somehow produce different results.\n\nIn other words, countering the excesses of the left with the same excesses on the right dooms those on the political right to repeat, rather than correct, the follies of their opponents.\n\nTake DEI. A well-intentioned goal of greater access for minorities in an increasingly diverse country animated the DEI mission within the Democratic Party. But subsequent manifestations of the ideology in cultural institutions and schools destroyed faith in the project, as unpopular racial preferencing took precedence over meritocracy, and a commitment to a highly politicized anti-racist agenda was mandated to the detriment of other civil liberties, such as freedom of speech or conscience.\n\nBiden's executive order \" to advance an ambitious, whole-of-government equity agenda \" exposed Democrats to the charge of granting the government too much power over a nebulous issue that arguably involved an attempt at thought control. The new \"equity agenda\" represented a departure from a civil rights-era commitment to equality of opportunity , in which meritocracy-the content of one's character, if you like-counted more than skin color or group identity in determining outcomes.\n\nIn his countermove, Trump could have scrapped the federal DEI program on the grounds that unpopular activist agendas have no place in government. Instead, he harnessed the same overreach of federal power for his own activist agenda, not only shutting down DEI programs in the government, but creating a list of private companies to pursue for theirs. If voters hoped for a check on a leftward ideology that surveilled federal employees for latent signs of racism, Trump has delivered its mirror image: a ban of DEI that encourages a McCarthy-style purge of the old ideology and vows to \"excise references to DEI ... principles, under whatever name they may appear,\" raising the same alarm bells over freedom of speech and conscience that DEI did.\n\nThe MAGA campaign promised an end to the broader climate of \"woke,\" better characterized by political philosopher John Gray as \"hyper-liberal ideology.\" One of the critiques of this ideology was its \"virtue-signalling\" policy rhetoric, which promised justice, but when carried through often worsened the causes it claimed to champion. Federal and corporate DEI workshops can actually make people more racist , for example. Biden's student debt forgiveness promised \"to ensure higher-education is a ticket to the middle class, not a barrier to opportunity,\" when in fact , \"between 69 and 73 percent of the debt forgiven accrues to households in the top 60 percent of the income distribution.\" The COVID school closures advocated by left-leaning teachers' unions and Democratic states disproportionately affected poor students and students of color , while it became taboo in progressive circles to question them at all.\n\nIn these and other issues like gender activism and \"defund the police,\" rhetoric from progressive Democrats alienated their previous working-class voters and made them the party of the elitism they purported to topple. This is partly because to understand and advance hyperliberal ideology requires access to money, education and networks. The loudest voices pushing niche identity politics were likely several degrees of insulation away from the poverty and crime that actually beleaguered people.\n\nFor Gray, this is where hyperliberalism departs from more focused historical activism that sought to end class inequality. \"Once questions of identity become central in politics,\" he writes , \"conflicts of economic interests can be disregarded.\" Many of the left's rallying cries, in other words, involved minimal real sacrifice from the privileged. They could believe they were justice-warriors who championed the poor while remaining almost entirely in the realm of discourse, rather than substantially parting from their own time, money, or status.\n\nTrump's MAGA campaign promised an end to such reality-estranged identity politics. But so far, we've only seen a different set of elite, out-of-touch billionaires cravenly insert their own identity-based shibboleths in place of their opponents' mantras. Left or right, these are still the politics of identity , and they still deflect from the issues that face voters on the ground, while encouraging toxic, irrational tribalism on both sides of the aisle.\n\nA post-Biden administration could have called out the hypocrisy of an elite-educated class who could fiscally and culturally afford to prioritize policies' language and political coding over their efficacy or appeal. Instead, Trump has used the same playbook: shouting loudly to signal to his base that he will deliver radical \"justice\" for them, while neglecting pesky little details of whether or not the policies will actually work for the groups he's speaking to.\n\nBrazen economic moves like tariffs may signal a grand shakeup to Americans who feel forgotten or disadvantaged by the globalized economy, but they are likely to only hurt American consumers by raising the prices of goods and services across the country. Meanwhile, the DOGE chainsaw antics-what Paul Krugman calls \" austerity theater \"-has so far succeeded only in making government less effective and has little chance of cutting federal spending in a meaningful way. The fact that the man holding the chainsaw is the literal richest in the world and likely invulnerable to any catastrophic fallout of his actions smacks of the same hypocrisy of those who rallied to \"defund the police\" from the safety of their affluent gated neighborhoods.\n\nIf much of the justice-signaling by the privileged left was \"virtue theater\"-a performance both untethered to and masquerading real issues-Trump's circus show is no better. \"Queers for Palestine\" contains no more irony than the party of evangelical Christians bending a knee toward a ketamine-fueled father of (reportedly) 14 children by four different mothers , or celebrating the return of the misogynist Tate brothers from Romania, where they picked up charges of human trafficking, rape, and money laundering .\n\nAnother breaking point was the far left's moral confusion in the immediate wake of Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel. Widespread campus protests and subsequent congressional hearings exposed disturbing antisemitic trends on the left: either the outright celebration of murder and rape under the guise of \"resistance\" or the quiet reluctance to name the event for what it was, regardless of preexistent geopolitical issues in the region: terrorist slaughter. Sam Harris, speaking of students at the most prestigious and historic universities in the country, wondered in 2024: \"Were you one of these imbeciles who couldn't figure out who the bad guys were on October 7th?\"\n\nHow are bad guys faring now? Promising to restore common sense to American culture would surely mean a new era of moral clarity when it comes to foreign adversaries. Instead, Trump and his administration have contorted themselves into the same ethical backbends that made children and elderly peaceniks in kibbutzim, at least to some Americans on the left, the villains on the day of their own slaughter. Now, the villains for some on the right are the legions of besieged, raped, and dead Ukrainians and their president, Volodymyr Zelensky, whom Trump calls a \" dictator \" and who he claims \" started the war \" with Putin's Russia.\n\nAt the heart of the hypocrisy lies that uncanny resemblance between the two political poles. The writer Andrew Sullivan describes MAGA's governing tactics in terms often associated with hyperliberals at the height of \"woke.\" For both the critical theorists on the far left and the post-fact MAGA brigade, \"truth\" is fundamentally unfixed and can therefore be contorted to meet the needs of today's narrative or tomorrow's explanation. \"Critical Trump Theory,\" Sullivan writes , \"is unfalsifiable, irrational, and seeks to replace objective reality with Trump's lived experience so that, in the end, only his power remains.\"\n\nThe promise was common sense. The delivery is an inversion of truth and morality. In the case of Ukraine, this not only deserts an ally and desecrates American credibility on the world stage; it heralds a dangerous split with Western allies and a departure from a liberal Western worldview.\n\nThe mistake was ever hoping that actual historic American values-the checks and balances, individualism, distrust of centralized power, and inherent governmental restraint embedded in the classical liberalism that shaped the American Constitution-occupied any space in the MAGA promise. Some Trump champions have cheaply invoked the revolutionary nature of America's founding as a justification for the insurrectionary chaos of its administration. But the careful, discerning spirit of the American Revolution, not to mention the self-knowledge of the Founders, finds no place in the MAGA movement.\n\nThe 18th century American Revolution grounded itself in the cautious notion that, as John Adams warned , \"absolute power intoxicates alike despots, monarchs, aristocrats, and democrats.\" Yet we still see this intoxication play out today, as both left and right succumb to the seductive thrill of illiberal power.\n\nMegan Dent is a writer and academic based in Oxford, UK.

      "text": "Trump's Ukraine Dealmaking Hits Snags\n\nFrustration in Washington builds as Russia undermines Ukraine peace talks.\n\nAudio versions are only available to subscribers of The Dispatch. Join Today ! to listen to this post.\n\nHappy Tuesday! We would do an April Fools' Day bit, but we've learned our lesson about jokes taken literally.\n\nSpeaking to NBC News on Sunday, President Donald Trump said that he was \"very angry, pissed off\" at Vladimir Putin. The president's rare invective against the Russian leader, together with his threat to impose tariffs on international buyers of the country's oil, appeared to reflect the administration's growing frustration at the main obstacle to a durable peace deal in Ukraine: the Kremlin.\n\nLast month, Russia effectively rejected a Ukrainian-endorsed U.S. proposal to freeze fighting along all fronts for 30 days. Now, Putin is dragging his feet on Trump's efforts to secure significantly pared-down deals to mutually halt attacks on energy targets and on the Black Sea-a strategy that could backfire as Trump considers ways to force Russia into concessions.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump threatened to target not just Russian oil but also its international purchasers with hefty tariffs unless there's a breakthrough. \"If Russia and I are unable to make a deal on stopping the bloodshed in Ukraine, and if I think it was Russia's fault ... I am going to put secondary tariffs on all oil coming out of Russia,\" the president told NBC . But the timeline of such a move remains unclear. Asked by reporters on Air Force One whether there is a date by which he expects Putin to make a broader ceasefire deal, Trump said Moscow faces a \"psychological\" deadline. \"If I think they're tapping us along, I will not be happy about it,\" he added.\n\nBut the administration has struggled to secure even more limited truces between the two warring parties. Last week, the White House announced that Ukraine and Russia had agreed to a pair of deals to \"ensure safe navigation, eliminate the use of force, and prevent the use of commercial vessels for military purposes\" in the Black Sea. Yet Moscow continues to push back on the terms. In addition to demanding that Europe reintegrate its agricultural bank, Rosselkhozbank, into the SWIFT banking system, Russia is calling for the lifting of all sanctions on the bank and other financial institutions involved in the country's agricultural transactions.\n\nThere are also continued disagreements over what is covered by a partial ceasefire to halt attacks on Russian and Ukrainian energy sites, which the Trump administration first announced more than two weeks ago. While the U.S. and Ukraine say the deal outlaws strikes against Ukraine's oil and gas production facilities, Moscow claims otherwise . On Friday, a Russian drone attack damaged a gas production facility in an apparent violation of the partial truce. And Russia's defense ministry accused Ukraine of using drones to target a power grid facility in the Kursk region and an electric facility in the Bryansk region last week, actions Ukrainian officials deny.\n\nOn the battlefield, Russia is continuing to make slow advances in eastern Ukraine-at the cost of major combat losses. And it could be preparing for an even larger offensive. According to a report by the Associated Press, Ukrainian officials believe Russia is readying its forces for another multi-pronged attack in the spring and summer as a way to pressure Ukraine for more concessions in ongoing ceasefire talks. The incursions are expected to target the Sumy, Kharkiv, and Zaporizhzhia regions. \"They're dragging out the talks and trying to get the U.S. stuck in endless and pointless discussions about fake 'conditions' just to buy time and then try to grab more land,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned on Thursday.\n\nAnd Russian air attacks across Ukraine continue apace. On Friday, a large-scale drone attack on the eastern city of Dnipro killed four people and injured 21 others. Overnight Saturday, two people were killed and 35 others were wounded by drones in Ukraine's second largest city of Kharkiv.\n\nOn the other side of the border, Ukrainian forces have in recent weeks given up significant ground in Russia's Kursk region. But they've also begun a quiet push into the neighboring Belgorod region, according to Russian military bloggers. Neither Russia nor Ukraine has confirmed the incursions, but they appear to be part of Kyiv's efforts to secure bargaining chips for future land swaps. \"We will swap one territory for another,\" Zelensky told The Guardian in February.\n\nMeanwhile, Europe is continuing to chart ways to support Ukraine amid the uncertainty surrounding future U.S. security assistance. On Thursday, the \"coalition of the willing\"-a group of countries attempting to develop a peacekeeping structure for a post-truce Ukraine- agreed to expand intelligence sharing with Kyiv following a summit in Paris.\n\nSeveral European countries also announced new weapons shipments to the war-torn country. On Wednesday, France committed to a $2.1 billion military aid package, including anti-tank missiles, air defense systems, armored vehicles, and other supplies. The Netherlands on Sunday pledged $541 million to boost Ukraine's drone capabilities. And on Monday, Sweden unveiled its largest weapons package to Ukraine yet, committing nearly $1.6 billion in equipment including air defense and maritime capabilities.\n\nBut it remains to be seen whether Europe's help will give Ukraine a badly needed leg up going into ceasefire talks. \"We are now at a critical stage of the war. Our focus is now on supporting Ukraine as much as possible so that they can get into a position of strength during these negotiations,\" Swedish Defense Minister Pål Jonson said Monday . \"More [countries] need to do more.\"\n\nPeter Navarro, senior counselor to the president for trade and manufacturing, had the following exchange during an interview with Fox News on Sunday.\n\nFox News host Sharron Bream: The president says he doesn't care if the prices go up on U.S. cars, so what's the message to the U.S. consumer?\n\nNavarro: The message is that tariffs are tax cuts. Tariffs are jobs. Tariffs are national security. Tariffs are great for America. Tariffs will make America great again.\n\nBloomberg : Trump Plans to Contact North Korea, Touting 'Good Relationship'\n\nNPR : White House Says It's 'Case Closed' on the Signal Group Chat Review\n\nIf you're feeling down about the state of the world, you'll probably want to steer clear of the new season of Black Mirror , which is set to hit Netflix on April 10.\n\nDo you see Trump's tough talk on Russia as a positive sign?\n\nCharlotte Lawson is the editor of The Morning Dispatch and currently based in Tel Aviv, Israel.

See you tomorrow!\n\nThe United States confirmed 73,919 new cases of COVID-19 yesterday, with 9.8 percent of the 754,858 tests reported coming back positive. An additional 1,035 deaths were attributed to the virus on Tuesday, bringing the pandemic's American death toll to 141,992.\n\nA new report from the Centers for Disease Control estimated the true number of coronavirus cases in the United States could range from six to 24 times the number of confirmed cases, depending on geographic location. Much of the study's data is from March and April, but it concludes that the vast majority of Americans are still vulnerable to COVID-19.\n\nFBI agents arrested Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder and four others-including former Ohio GOP Chairman Matt Borges-as part of a $60 million bribery and racketeering investigation. \"This is likely the largest bribery, money laundering scheme ever perpetrated against the people of the state of Ohio,\" said U.S. Attorney David DeVillers.\n\nPresident Trump signed an executive order yesterday ordering the Census Bureau to exclude undocumented immigrants from the population count that establishes how many members of Congress each state is apportioned.\n\nJoe Biden rolled out a $775 billion plan on Tuesday that would deploy tax credits and subsidies to make child care more affordable, establish universal pre-K for 3- and 4-year-olds, and lower taxes for Americans who care for elderly family members themselves.\n\nThe Justice Department indicted two Chinese nationals for hacking into a number of businesses, governments, and non-governmental organizations over the past 10 years. Biotech companies working on COVID-19 vaccines and treatments were a recent target of the duo.\n\nTwitter announced a crackdown on the QAnon conspiracy theory yesterday, removing more than 7,000 accounts associated with it from its platform and blocking tweets sharing links associated with the theory.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz, a Republican from Florida and an outspoken fan of the president, allegedly violated congressional ethics rules by paying a speechwriting consultant with taxpayer dollars and having a television studio built in his father's home.\n\nIf you ask a Republican elected official today what he or she thinks of President Trump and his efforts to Make America Great Again, you'll likely get the same answer that you would have gotten yesterday, or a year ago, or any day since Trump completed his takeover of the GOP on November 8, 2016: \"I support the president.\" Some might even go out of their way to praise his golf game .\n\nBut 104 days out from November's election, Trump is now trailing Joe Biden nationally by nearly 9 points -and Republican members of Congress are starting to scramble to hedge their bets.\n\nWhether it comes in 2021 or 2025, there is going to be a post-Trump GOP. Heck, that reality is one of the reasons the newsletter you're reading right now exists in the first place. Privately, many Republicans are beginning to come to terms with that great unknown, and the increasing likelihood it will be upon us in four months, not four years. Yesterday provided a remarkable window into the fierce battles for the soul of the party to come.\n\nHouse Freedom Caucus demands party unity.\n\nClose followers of Congress and the GOP will immediately notice the absurdity in the above headline. Members of the House Freedom Caucus (HFC)-founded in early 2015 to advocate for \"open, accountable and limited government, the Constitution and the rule of law, and policies that promote the liberty, safety, and prosperity of all Americans\"-were for years a thorn in Republican leadership's side. Banding together, the group of about 30 members had the power to hold legislation-and then-Speaker John Boehner-hostage. And they did . Repeatedly.\n\nBut yesterday, the shoe was on the other foot. As Steve reports in a piece for the site  Tuesday's House Republican Conference meeting-conducted on a day when more than 1,000 American deaths from COVID-19 were reported* and about a week before key CARES Act provisions are set to expire-quickly devolved into what can only be described as a group venting session for Freedom Caucus members, in which they took turns airing their grievances with Conference Chair Rep. Liz Cheney.\n\n\"Jim Jordan-my colleague, my mentor, my friend-made the case strongly that Liz Cheney is hurting President Trump,\" Rep. Matt Gaetz, an HFC member, said on his podcast, called \"Hot Takes w/Matt Gaetz.\" \"Jim pointed out Liz's opposition to the president's Afghanistan policy, the president's Germany policy, the president's response to coronavirus, her tweets attacking him and, frankly, her effort to try to oust Republican Thomas Massie.\"\n\nOther members of the House Freedom Caucus lined up to take shots at Cheney, too. Rep. Chip Roy, in a competitive race in Texas, complained that Cheney had defended Dr. Anthony Fauci from GOP attacks, providing campaign fodder to his Democrat opponent. Rep. Andy Biggs, current chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, suggested that if Republicans remained in the minority after November, Cheney would share the blame.\n\nSoon after the meeting, Donald Trump Jr. decided to get in on the fun. \"We already have one Mitt Romney, we don't need another,\" he tweeted , referencing Cheney. But Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy defended his Conference's No. 3 in leadership. \"We're honored to have [Cheney] as conference chair,\" he said. \"She does an amazing job.\"\n\nCheney, for her part, made an effort to downplay the confrontation, telling CNN the flare up was merely a \"healthy exchange of views\" and that the conference is \"all unified in recognizing the danger the country would face if Joe Biden were elected president.\" The daughter of the former vice president did, however, get in a shot at the son of the current president. \"Donald Trump Jr. is not a member of the House Republican Conference,\" she said matter-of-factly.\n\nBrendan Buck, a top aide for former House Speaker Paul Ryan, tweeted that while \"griping at leadership is basically the defining characteristic of a House GOP Conference meeting,\" an \"ambush like this against one member is actually quite rare.\"\n\n\"It's hard not to look at this and see Trumpists starting to set up folks to blame if he loses,\" Buck said in a follow-up email to The Dispatch . \"It won't just be [Cheney] though. There will be plenty of other targets. In reality what Cheney is being accused of is holding consistent conservative views that haven't changed just because Trump is president.\"\n\nSenate GOP: 'What in the hell are we doing?'\n\nThings got testy-though far less heated-on the other side of the Capitol on Tuesday as well.\n\nWe last wrote to you about coronavirus relief package negotiations between President Trump, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Those negotiations were opened up to the rest of the conference yesterday when Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows dropped by the Senate GOP lunch.\n\nIt went about as well as you could expect to go with 53 people with differing agendas and constituencies haggling over hundreds of billions of dollars and the future of their careers.\n\n\"What in the hell are we doing?\" Sen. Ted Cruz asked his colleagues, according to two sources familiar. He was objecting to the case-made by Mnuchin, Sen. Tom Cotton, and others-for another massive ($1 trillion) spending bill. Cruz said that the biggest priority in this next bill should be safely restarting the economy, adding that if things are still locked down come November, Joe Biden will win the White House and the GOP will be in the Senate minority-\"meeting in a much smaller lunch room.\"\n\nInterestingly, Cotton had cited political realities to make the exact opposite case: The GOP should bite the bullet on the $1 trillion price tag now, because it would boost the party's chances of holding onto the Senate come November and blocking even more spending down the road. \"If you think this bill is expensive,\" Cotton said, according to a source present, \"wait until you see the Schumer-Pelosi-Biden agenda after the election.\"\n\nCotton is up for re-election in Arkansas this November, but his only challenger is a relatively unknown member of the Libertarian Party named Ricky Dale Harrington. His main concern, according to sources familiar, was for his colleagues in much tougher races. Some of them-he mentioned McConnell and Sen. John Cornyn, among others-would be even more vulnerable if the Senate doesn't move on additional relief.\n\nSen. Pat Toomey-more in the Cruz camp on this issue than the Cotton one- told Declan last week that there could be \"significant Republican opposition in the Senate\" to a package that comes in at around $1 trillion, adding that any legislation should be careful not to \"exacerbate incentives to stay out of work.\"\n\nAny opposition at all would represent an infinite percentage increase from pushback to the CARES Act, which passed the Senate unanimously back in March. But-at least for the time being-this is still Donald Trump's Republican Party, and the likelihood of enough senators banding together to block an eventual package is miniscule. \"I wouldn't be shocked if a package comes together that is on the order of a trillion dollars,\" Toomey conceded. \"If the administration strikes a deal with Speaker Pelosi, then it's very likely that that'll end up passing and getting signed into law.\"\n\nWhat comes next\n\nThe Trump electorate, as constituted, is not going to outlast Trump himself. Other politicians over the past four years have tried to emulate his style-and more will undoubtedly do so in the future-but a winning Electoral College coalition that mashes together devout Evangelicals, lifelong Blue Dog Democrats, C-suite executives, and the alt-right is likely Donald Trump's, and Donald Trump's alone.\n\nIf he does lose in November, as is looking increasingly likely (but there's still a long way until the election!), the fight for dominance in the post-Trump GOP will start immediately, and it will be vicious. The groundwork is being laid now.\n\nThe House Freedom Caucus-types that have gone all-in on Trump the man will be looking for a place to lay the blame for his loss. Those who've gone all-in on nationalist, populist Trump ism- Cotton, Sen. Josh Hawley, Tucker Carlson, etc.-will argue Trump's message was correct but the messenger was flawed. Expect many who went along to get along these past four years to start playing up their differences with Trump to get a head start on the competition in the case of a Biden landslide.\n\nWhich faction comes out on top will depend on a whole host of factors, not least of which is the margin in November. But rest assured: If you're interested in these coming battles and how they will play out, you're subscribed to the right newsletter.\n\nPresident Trump held his first coronavirus-focused press briefing since April yesterday, speaking to reporters alone rather than being accompanied by Dr. Anthony Fauci, Dr. Deborah Birx, and other members of the coronavirus task force. The task force's daily briefings were originally called off months ago when it became clear the president's combative tone and freewheeling rhetoric were hurting his political standing, frustrating Republicans in Congress and unnerving many Americans.\n\nIn contrast to the March and April briefings, however, Tuesday's press conference was remarkably low-key and to-the-point. Trump spent about 15 minutes reading written remarks-largely staying on script and avoiding his characteristic ad-libbing-and then took questions for a similar period of time before ending the event. The president's tenor wasn't entirely devoid of his usual Trumpian eccentricities (repeatedly insisting on calling COVID-19 the \"China virus,\" for example), but the 30-odd minute briefing was a relatively professional affair, when compared to its chaotic daily renditions in the earlier months of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe dustbin of history is littered with examples of pundits and news outlets celebrating a presidential pivot or shift in tone from Trump. We won't make any such claim here, it never ages well. But nevertheless, yesterday's briefing is indicative of a White House coming to grips with the fact that its coronavirus strategy has thus far been a political loser-and is scrambling to change course.\n\nThis rebrand is noticeable in the administration's disposition towards mask-wearing in recent days. Trump, who had resisted appearing publicly in a mask for months, and publicly mocked a reporter for wearing one during a briefing as \"politically correct,\" did so for the first time on July 11 during a visit to the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center outside Washington, D.C. He tweeted that mask-wearing was \"patriotic\" earlier this week, a sentiment he repeated when the issue came up during Tuesday's briefing. \"I have no problem with the mask,\" he said when pressed by reporters on his previous skepticism, pulling out his custom-made presidential mask to show to the cameras and saying that he carried it with him everywhere. \"Anything that can help, I think we should do.\"\n\nBut while the president's comments yesterday still contained plenty of his signature bluster-he quadrupled down on his insistence that the virus will \"disappear,\" for example-Trump's briefing was more level-headed than usual and contained some surprising realism about the state of the pandemic. The virus \"is likely to get worse before it gets better,\" he admitted at one point. \"[That's] something I don't like saying about things, but that's the way it is.\"\n\nIn her latest for Harper's , Annie Hylton profiles Syrian human rights lawyer Anwar al-Bunni and his search for war criminals of Bashar al-Assad's regime among European refugees. The heart rending story details the detainment, torture, and execution of many thousands of innocent civilians in Syria and the ongoing effort to hold the perpetrators accountable. \"For al-Bunni's part, such cases are about more than the people on trial. They are about laying bare Assad's atrocities-torture, murder, gender-based violence-in a court of law, for the historical record,\" Hylton writes. \"Al-Bunni believes that Raslan's case will \"give hope to the victims, who, after nine years now, think nobody cares about what happened in Syria.\" He wants to send Assad's regime a message: \"Justice is coming.\"\n\nPresident Trump reportedly asked Woody Johnson-New York Jets owner turned U.S. ambassador to the U.K.-if he could convince the British government to move the annual British Open golf tournament to the Trump Turnberry resort in Scotland. Johnson's deputy, Lewis Lukens, emailed State Department officials about the incident, and a few months later he was gone-Johnson forced him out. Johnson, the White House, and the State Department declined to comment on the story from Mark Landler, Lara Jakes, and Maggie Haberman in the New York Times.\n\nJUST IN: Pres.

The latest French Press (🔒)shifts gears, bringing a discussion of competence to the table. David highlights the discord sown when government actors fail to restore peace at the same time that they actively violate civil liberties. \"Why do I say the Trump response is incompetent?\" he asks. \"It commits the cardinal sin of responding to civil unrest, in that it introduced enough additional force to inflame the resistance but not enough additional force (or effective tactics) to quell the resistance.\"\n\nIn the year of murder hornets and extraterrestrial life, no claims are too outlandish to rule out completely.
