As Trump and Republicans prepare to negotiate new tax cuts in 2025 , it's worth gleaning lessons from the president-elect's first set of cuts.\n\nThe 2017 cuts were the most extensive revision to the Internal Revenue Code since the Ronald Reagan administration. The changes it imposed range from the tax that corporations pay on their foreign income to limits on the deductions individuals can take for their state and local tax payments.\n\nTrump promised middle-class benefits at the time, but in practice more than 80% of the cuts went to corporations, tax partnerships and high-net-worth individuals . The cost to the U.S. deficit was huge - a total increase of US$1.9 trillion from 2018 to 2028, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office . The tax advantage to the middle class was small.\n\nAdvantages for Black Americans were smaller still. As a scholar of race and U.S. income taxation , I have analyzed the impact of Trump's tax cuts. I found that the law has disadvantaged middle-income, low-income and Black taxpayers in several ways.\n\nThese results are not new. They were present nearly 30 years ago when my colleague William Whitford and I used U.S. Census Bureau data to show that Black taxpayers paid more federal taxes than white taxpayers with the same income. In large part that's because the legacy of slavery , Jim Crow and structural racism keeps Black people from owning homes.\n\nThe federal income tax is full of advantages for home ownership that many Black taxpayers are unable to reach. These benefits include the ability to deduct home mortgage interest and local property taxes , and the right to avoid taxes on up to $500,000 of profit on the sale of a home.\n\nIt's harder for middle-class Black people to get a mortgage than it is for low-income white people. This is true even when Black Americans with high credit scores are compared with white Americans with low credit scores.\n\nWhen Black people do get mortgages, they are charged higher rates than their white counterparts.\n\nTrump did not create these problems.

A fair tax structure means that those earning similar incomes should pay similar taxes and stipulates that taxes should not increase income or wealth disparities.\n\nTrump's tax cuts contradict both principles.\n\nProponents of Trump's cuts argued the corporate rate cut would trickle down to all Americans . This is a foundational belief of \" supply side \" economics, a philosophy that President Ronald Reagan made popular in the 1980s.\n\nFrom the Reagan administration on, every tax cut for the rich has skewed to the wealthy .\n\nJust like prior \"trickle down\" plans, Trump's corporate tax cuts did not produce higher wages or increased household income . Instead, corporations used their extra cash to pay dividends to their shareholders and bonuses to their executives.\n\nOver that same period, the bottom 90% of wage earners saw no gains in their real wages . Meanwhile, the AFL-CIO, a labor group, estimates that 51% of the corporate tax cuts went to business owners and 10% went to the top five highest-paid senior executives in each company. Fully 38% went to the top 10% of wage earners.\n\nIn other words, the income gap between wealthy Americans and everyone else has gotten much wider under Trump's tax regime.\n\nTrump's tax cuts also increased income and wealth disparities by race because those corporate tax savings have gone primarily to wealthy shareholders rather than spreading throughout the population.\n\nThe reasons are simple. In the U.S., shareholders are mostly corporations, pension funds and wealthy individuals . And wealthy people in the U.S. are almost invariably white .\n\nSixty-six percent of white families own stocks , while less than 40% of Black families and less than 30% of Hispanic families do. Even when comparing Black and white families with the same income, the race gap in stock ownership remains.\n\nThese disparities stem from the same historical disadvantages that result in lower Black homeownership rates. Until the Civil War, virtually no Black person could own property or enter into a contract . After the Civil War, Black codes - laws that specifically controlled and oppressed Black people - forced free Black Americans to work as farmers or servants.\n\nState prohibitions on Black people owning property , and public and private theft of Black-owned land , kept Black Americans from accumulating wealth.\n\nThat said, the Trump tax cuts hurt low-income taxpayers of all races.\n\nOne way they did so was by abolishing the individual mandate requiring all Americans to have basic health insurance. The Affordable Care Act, passed under President Barack Obama, launched new, government-subsidized health plans and penalized people for not having health insurance.\n\nDepartment of the Treasury data shows almost 50 million Americans were covered by the Affordable Care Act since 2014. After the individual mandate was revoked, between 3 million and 13 million fewer people purchased health insurance in 2020 .\n\nEnding the mandate triggered a large drop in health insurance coverage , and research shows it was primarily lower-income people who stopped buying subsidized insurance from the Obamacare exchanges. These are the same people who are the most vulnerable to financial disaster from unpaid medical bills .\n\nGoing without insurance hurt all low-income Americans. But studies suggest the drop in Black Americans' coverage under Trump's plan outpaced that of white Americans . The rate of uninsured Black Americans rose from 10.7% in 2016 to 11.5% in 2018, following the mandate's repeal.\n\nThe Trump tax cuts also altered how the Internal Revenue Service calculates inflation adjustments for over 60 different provisions. These include the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit - both of which provide cash to low-wage workers - and the wages that must pay Social Security taxes.\n\nPreviously, the IRS used the consumer price index for urban consumers , which tracks rising prices by comparing the cost of the same goods as they rise or fall, to calculate inflation. The government then used that inflation number to adjust Social Security payments and earned income tax credit eligibility . It used the same figure to set the amount of income that is taxed at a given rate.\n\nThe Trump tax cuts ordered the IRS to calculate inflation adjustments using the chained consumer price index for urban consumers instead.\n\nThe difference between these two indexes is that the second one assumes people substitute cheaper goods as prices rise . For example, the chained consumer price index assumes shoppers will buy pork instead of beef if beef prices go up, easing the impact of inflation on a family's overall grocery prices.\n\nThe IRS makes smaller inflation adjustments based on that assumption. But low-income neighborhoods have less access to the kind of budget-friendly options envisioned by the chained consumer price index.\n\nAnd since even middle-class Black people are more likely than poor white people to live in low-income neighborhoods , Black taxpayers have been hit harder by rising prices.\n\nWhat cost $1 in 2018 now costs $1.26 .

      "text": "Black and Biracial Americans Wouldn't Have to Code-Switch if We Lived in a Post-Racial Society\n\nBoots Rileyâ€TMs new film â€œ Sorry to Bother You â€� does anything but apologize.\n\nIn telling the story of Cassius, a young black man who becomes an extraordinarily successful telemarketer after he starts using his â€œwhite voice,â€� it showcases the magnitude of racial and class oppression.\n\nColloquially, Cassiusâ€TM use of a â€œwhite voiceâ€� is known as code-switching , and the film highlights something that most African-Americans could probably tell you: The ability to code-switch is often a prerequisite to becoming a successful black person in America.\n\nAs a race scholar and sociologist, Iâ€TMve studied biracial Americans who engage in code-switching. I found that the ability to deftly code-switch has some real advantages. But it also has its fair share of pitfalls.\n\nMore broadly, it has led me to wonder what the persistence of code-switching tells us about race, opportunities and making connections in America today.\n\nAdapting to the dominant culture\n\nCode-switching is the practice of interacting in different ways depending on the social context, and it isnâ€TMt limited to race. Most of us interact differently when hanging out with friends than we would during a job interview.\n\nHowever, due in large measure to structural inequality and centuries of segregation, different cultural norms and ways of speaking have emerged among white and black Americans.\n\nBut because dominant culture is white, whiteness has been baked into institutions as natural, normal and legitimate. So thereâ€TMs much more incentive for people of color to code-swich â€\" to adapt to the dominant culture to improve their prospects. White people rarely, if ever, feel this same pressure in their daily lives.\n\nFor this reason, the notion of a person of color deploying a â€œwhite voiceâ€� in the workplace (or anywhere in American society) isnâ€TMt a new phenomenon.\n\nBiracial people create somewhat of a different dynamic due to their backgrounds. Often they have to navigate groups that are either all white or all black. In each instance, theyâ€TMre outsiders who need to send certain signals â€\" or avoid certain landmines â€\" to fit in.\n\nIn my research, I explain how black and white biracial Americans deploy what I call â€œ racial capital .â€�\n\nI interviewed 60 black-white biracial Americans and asked them how their lives were shaped by race. I soon realized that they seemed to be pulling from a repertoire of resources in order to break down racial barriers and establish in-group membership among whites and blacks.\n\nI categorized this repertoire into four areas: knowledge, experiences, meanings and language.\n\nThe language category involves code-switching.\n\nFor example, one of my interviewees bragged about her ability to code-switch : â€œTo some people, Iâ€TMll say â€ ̃He was handsome!â€TM versus â€ ̃He fine as hell, girl!â€TM And I think Iâ€TMm the baddest because I can talk to this group and that group in the same way that they talk.â€�\n\nBut this doesnâ€TMt always work. One person I interviewed explained that when he didnâ€TMt dap properly at his predominately black barbershop, the other patrons laughed at him and treated him like an outsider.\n\nOther times, people are â€œcaught in the act,â€� meaning people witness them interacting differently in ways that are shaped by race. This makes others question their authenticity, which ultimately jeopardizes any connection.\n\nOne participant in my study told me that he is perpetually self-conscious about code-switching out of fear that someone would witness his behavior and question his authenticity.\n\nAnother participant echoed his concern: â€œI feel almost bad sometimes when someone sees [me code-switch],â€� she said, â€œbecause they are like â€ ̃Whatâ€TMs going on?â€TM Especially my boyfriend â€\" heâ€TMll be like â€ ̃Who are you?â€TMâ€�\n\nAnd one person I spoke with said that it was â€œhumiliatingâ€� when others saw him code-switch because people â€œjust donâ€TMt understand.â€�\n\nThese are the costs of code-switching, and my participants continually risked being misunderstood and treated as outsiders.\n\nBecause of societal pressures, itâ€TMs a risk black and biracial people are clearly willing to keep taking.\n\nAn oppressive script\n\nCode-switching would not be necessary if white privilege hadnâ€TMt been embedded in every social institution in American society for centuries. More and more, researchers have been able to show how racism has been rooted in how  American society is organized.\n\nIn the workplace, black people face more obstacles to career advancement and a growing racial wage gap . In education, schools in poor black neighborhoods receive less resources , while teachers mete out disproportionately harsh disciplinary treatment for students of color . In politics, we see a lack of proportional representation among elected officials and recently witnessed the election of a president who routinely disparages people of color . In entertainment, there is a lack of diverse, nuanced, fully human characters of color . Even in religion, deities have been whitewashed .\n\nDespite this documented reality, there are those who think that racism in America is a myth , that reverse racism is a threat or that our society is largely colorblind â€\" a convenient way to avoid grappling with the severe discrepancy between societal values like equality and the reality of structural, intergenerational inequality.\n\nI argue that there would be no need for racial capital if we were truly in a â€œpost-racialâ€� society â€\" that is, a society where race carried no meaning.\n\nWhy would black and biracial Americans feel compelled to change the way they interact â€\" the words they use â€\" if race no longer mattered?\n\nAlthough my study is about biracial Americans engaging in code-switching to bond with whites and blacks â€\" and â€œSorry to Bother Youâ€� is about a monoracial black man engaging in code-switching to perform well in his job â€\" for everyone involved, code-switching serves the same purpose: to create a connection that will generate opportunities.\n\nYet the fact that code-switching is blatantly referred to as the â€œwhite voiceâ€� in the film underscores the power of whiteness â€\" and the persistence of white privilege.\n\nEven though we are becoming more racially and ethnically diverse, we are seeing racial tensions rise . Rampant racial inequality is evidence that white privilege continues to prevail.\n\nIn the film, Cassiusâ€TM manager fervently urges him to â€œstick to the script.â€�\n\nThere is no room for individuality, nuance or variation, which precisely captures the oppression of being compelled to code-switch.\n\nWhiteness is the script, and code-switching is merely a strategy to adapt.\n\nRace relations will continue to deteriorate unless our societyâ€TMs script undergoes some serious revisions.\n\nChandra D.L.

(William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C. - With a record 62 elected Black officials, including historic firsts of two women senators and two representatives from Alabama, the Congressional Black Caucus held a swearing-in ceremony Friday morning before members took the oath of office for the 119th U.S. Congress.\n\nDemocrats Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland and Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware will represent the first time two Black women will serve together in the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe caucus also marked the historic election of two Black U.S. House members from Alabama serving at the same time. Incumbent Rep. Terri Sewell has been joined by Shomari Figures, who was elected in November to represent the new 2nd Congressional District. Following a lawsuit, a federal court ordered the state in 2022 to draw a second \"opportunity district\" to provide a chance for Black voters to select their preferred candidate. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the lower court's ruling in 2023.\n\nSewell, a Democrat, recalled how the caucus was first established in 1971 with 13 members - 12 men and one woman. Today, a total of 67 Black lawmakers serve in Congress, the largest contingent ever on Capitol Hill.\n\nBut the five Republicans - Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina and Reps. Byron Donalds of Florida, Wesley Hunt of Texas, John James of Michigan and Burgess Owens of Utah - are not members of the Congressional Black Caucus and didn't attend the ceremony. All are ardent supporters of Republican President-elect Donald Trump . With the GOP in control of the House and Senate, they have stated their support for Trump's future policies and even a few of his controversial statements.\n\nAlthough the Black caucus isn't tied to a political party, the Democratic members said they will continue to challenge legislation they deem will negatively affect Black Americans.\n\n\"Today, we renew our pledge to fight racism where it exists, to weed out inequities in health care, the criminal justice system, education, voter access, and so many rights and benefits that are part and parcel of what it means to be Americans,\" said Sewell, who serves as chair of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's board of directors. \"We, in the Congressional Black Caucus, stand ready for the task ahead.\"\n\nRep. Glenn Ivey, a Maryland Democrat, said he's concerned about the Trump administration or his appointees using the U.S. Justice Department to get back at people they think are enemies. \"That's not the role of the Department of Justice,\" he said. \"Protecting the rule of law is what we've got to make sure happens now and going forward.\"\n\nIvey said that one way to combat Trump and his congressional allies is looking ahead to the 2026 midterm elections.\n\n\"I can remember back a few years ago where the Republicans controlled the White House, the Senate and the House. A few years after that, [then U.S. Sen.] Barack Obama got elected president, and we took back control of the Senate and the House,\" Ivey said after the ceremony. \"So a setback is a set up for a comeback. We're ready to come back.\"\n\nHundreds of family members, friends and supporters attended the ceremony at The Anthem including Marc Morial, president and chief executive officer of the National Urban League.\n\nMorial said in an interview just because Trump will be president doesn't mean the caucus stops its advocacy work.\n\n\"They should say to the president, 'if you want to meet us halfway on important priorities like voting rights, elimination of poverty, we will not say no,'\" Morial said. \"But if your plan is to administer solely to your MAGA base, we will lead the resistance.\"\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\n\nVirginia Mercury is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

Ron DeSantis' presidential campaign has been disrupted again by outrage over his state's adoption of new education standards teaching children that Black people learned valuable skills from their bondage in slavery - a claim the governor swiftly doubled down on , despite some commentators pointing out that many of the examples the Florida Department of Education provided were historically inaccurate .\n\nSpeaking to CNN on Monday, Joe Pinion, a Black GOP strategist and former candidate for Senate in New York, tore into DeSantis' bad judgment and bad read of history.\n\n\"I was struck really by Ron DeSantis doubling down on this,\" said anchor Erica Hill. \"You know, these are the standards, this is the history, hey, you could be a blacksmith and you could go use that somewhere. It is remarkable, and I think [former Congressman] Will Hurd, perhaps, put it really well when he said in a tweet ... basically saying, I can't believe I have to say this, but slavery wasn't a jobs program that taught beneficial skills. It was literally dehumanizing and subjugated people as property, because they lacked any rights or freedoms. When you look at this, Joe - especially as a Republican strategist - when you look at this, how is it that this is where Ron DeSantis is going? He is doubling down on this, and there is this push that somehow this is a more accurate view, accurate telling of U.S. history.\"\n\n\"Well, look, the only thing slavery taught anyone is that there are no limits to the brutality that lurks in the hearts of man,\" said Pinion. \"And the only thing that those comments teach us is that in many ways, the vestiges of that brutality still exists. There's nothing worse than trying to tell the people that are descendants of such brutal subjugation that somehow, there were some lessons learned along the way. It's a sad day.\"\n\nA bigger problem, Pinion continued, is that all of this drama distracts from one of the biggest issues facing Black Americans, which is that they are being shut out of the educational system, from majority-Black schools struggling, to a high profile incident at Texas A&M University where the president was forced to resign after interfering in the hiring of a Black journalist to a professorship.\n\n\"It's a broader issue that Black professors have struggled to get tenureship at many institutions,\" said Pinion. \"Issue by issue, I think the actual issues confronting Black people in many ways on a day-to-database get lost because of the insanity on the far fringes, when in reality, you're looking at California, where we have over 70 percent of juniors who are not reading at proficient levels, in Florida, you see those numbers much the same way for Black students. So those are the real issues, those are the real stakes. The civil rights issue of our time. And we have people trying to relitigate the values of the civil rights movement in the first place.\"\n\nWatch the video below or at this link .\n\nJoe Pinion slams Ron DeSantis' new education standards on slavery youtu.be"

      "text": "Trump was asked how to restore black Americans' trust in police - but he could only talk about himself\n\nDonald Trump is not an ideas man. This has been a defining feature of his presidency. He's not a learned policy wonk, understanding the complex nuances of law and governance. He is, at his core, just a former game show host and a con man.\n\nNever is this more clear than when reporters ask him about public policy problems he's not prepared for. (Of course, even on topics where Trump should be prepared, like health care, he struggles to put together a coherent thought.)\n\nThis happens even with friendly outlets. On Wednesday, Trump appeared with Fox News host Brian Kilmeade on his radio show. And in an exchange flagged by CNN's Daniel Dale, Kilmeade asked a surprisingly decent and provocative question.\n\nTrump had no idea how to respond, so he just rambled. But his rambling was revealing. It's worth quoting the entire exchange in full:\n\nAccording to an Axios-Ipsos poll, 70% of white Americans say they trust the local police. Only 36% of African-\n\nAmericans do. How do you attack that problem? How do you change things?\n\nTrump: Well I think it's a very sad problem. As you know, as a Republican I'm doing very well with African- Americans and with the vote, with the - in polls and everything - especially, I mean I haven't seen one very recently because you had the plague come in from China, so that changed things up, but we had the best economy ever, we had the best numbers for African-American employment and unemployment in history. Best homeownership - best everything. We had the best numbers in everything -- not only African-American, but the African-American numbers were great.\n\nK: But how do you handle the law enforcement part of this? How do you handle the law enforcement part of this?\n\nT: Well I think you have to get better than what they've been doing. I mean obviously that was a terrible thing. And I've spoken about it numerous times in various speeches. And you know, it's interesting: I spoke about it when we launched a very successful rocket -- a tremendous program that culminated on that day and obviously it goes on from there. But I then made a speech and it was a speech about the rocket, and I devoted 25% of the speech probably to what happened -- or more -- to what happened with respect to George -- George Floyd, and it was -- and then you listen to news, 'He doesn't talk about George Floyd.' The rocket went off, I then I made a speech, and I talked about George Floyd, but they said he didn't talk about George Floyd. Half -- maybe even almost half of the speech, but a large portion of the speech was devoted exactly to that. And so, you know, with - with the media you basically -- basically no matter what you do, it's never going to be good enough. But the people understand it.\n\nK: Right.\n\nT: And that's one of the beauties to social media. I mean, I would love not to even bother with social media. but\n\nI'm able to get my word out beautifully by social media. Fortunately. You use social media too.\n\nK: Right, also -\n\nT: But we have to get the word out. Look, we have to -- Brian, we have to get the police departments, everybody has to do better, has to do better. This is a long-term problem. This didn't happen today. This happened - I mean, a guy like Sleepy Joe Biden was in there for 43 years, then he says, 'I think we should do this' -- I saw today, he took his mask off for the first time in a while, I haven't seen his face for a long time. And he said, 'I think we should do this,' or 'I think we should do that.' And actually then he started speaking through the mask again. He feels comfortable with the mask on, I think, and - even though there was nobody anywhere near him, which is interesting. But he made a statement about what he should do. I said, he's been there for 43 years, he was vice president for 8 years, he didn't do a thing. His crime bill was a disaster.\n\nWhen asked about African-Americans, Trump did what he normally does and began talking about the economic success the country enjoyed before the pandemic. His claiming credit for this success is highly dubious and contestable, and it was completely unrelated to the question asked. So Kilmeade asked again.\n\nAnd still, Trump had nothing to say. So again, he just started talking about himself. He reverted to a comfortable topic, claiming that the media was unfair because it supposedly ignored his comments about George Floyd's death when he appeared at NASA. But what he's really demonstrating is that he has no ideas for how to actually address the problems the protesters are calling out. He seems to either be convinced that what he has said about Floyd should be enough to solve the problems, or he's unable to comprehend that there are concerns about public policy that have nothing to do with him in particular.\n\nFinally, he launched into a meandering rant about Biden, suggesting that under the Obama administration, nothing was done to fix policing in the United States. While the previous administration surely didn't do enough, and Biden himself has contributed to the criminal justice problems in the country, Trump completely ignored the fact that the Obama Justice Department actually did take significant steps toward reform following the protests in Ferguson. Under Trump, those efforts were rolled back."

      "text": "Trump's expiring 2017 tax cuts made income inequality worse and especially hurt Black Americans: study\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act , a set of tax cuts Donald Trump signed into law during his first term as president, will expire on Dec. 31, 2024. As Trump and Republicans prepare to negotiate new tax cuts in 2025 , it's worth gleaning lessons from the president-elect's first set of cuts.\n\nThe 2017 cuts were the most extensive revision to the Internal Revenue Code since the Ronald Reagan administration. The changes it imposed range from the tax that corporations pay on their foreign income to limits on the deductions individuals can take for their state and local tax payments.\n\nTrump promised middle-class benefits at the time, but in practice more than 80% of the cuts went to corporations, tax partnerships and high-net-worth individuals . The cost to the U.S. deficit was huge - a total increase of US$1.9 trillion from 2018 to 2028, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office . The tax advantage to the middle class was small.\n\nAdvantages for Black Americans were smaller still. As a scholar of race and U.S. income taxation , I have analyzed the impact of Trump's tax cuts. I found that the law has disadvantaged middle-income, low-income and Black taxpayers in several ways.\n\nThese results are not new. They were present nearly 30 years ago when my colleague William Whitford and I used U.S. Census Bureau data to show that Black taxpayers paid more federal taxes than white taxpayers with the same income. In large part that's because the legacy of slavery , Jim Crow and structural racism keeps Black people from owning homes.\n\nThe federal income tax is full of advantages for home ownership that many Black taxpayers are unable to reach. These benefits include the ability to deduct home mortgage interest and local property taxes , and the right to avoid taxes on up to $500,000 of profit on the sale of a home.\n\nIt's harder for middle-class Black people to get a mortgage than it is for low-income white people. This is true even when Black Americans with high credit scores are compared with white Americans with low credit scores.\n\nWhen Black people do get mortgages, they are charged higher rates than their white counterparts.\n\nTrump did not create these problems. But instead of closing these income and race disparities, his 2017 tax cuts made them worse .\n\nBlack taxpayers paid higher taxes than white taxpayers who matched them in income, employment, marriage and other significant factors.\n\nFairness is an article of faith in American tax policy. A fair tax structure means that those earning similar incomes should pay similar taxes and stipulates that taxes should not increase income or wealth disparities.\n\nTrump's tax cuts contradict both principles.\n\nProponents of Trump's cuts argued the corporate rate cut would trickle down to all Americans . This is a foundational belief of \" supply side \" economics, a philosophy that President Ronald Reagan made popular in the 1980s.\n\nFrom the Reagan administration on, every tax cut for the rich has skewed to the wealthy .\n\nJust like prior \"trickle down\" plans, Trump's corporate tax cuts did not produce higher wages or increased household income . Instead, corporations used their extra cash to pay dividends to their shareholders and bonuses to their executives.\n\nOver that same period, the bottom 90% of wage earners saw no gains in their real wages . Meanwhile, the AFL-CIO, a labor group, estimates that 51% of the corporate tax cuts went to business owners and 10% went to the top five highest-paid senior executives in each company. Fully 38% went to the top 10% of wage earners.\n\nIn other words, the income gap between wealthy Americans and everyone else has gotten much wider under Trump's tax regime.\n\nTrump's tax cuts also increased income and wealth disparities by race because those corporate tax savings have gone primarily to wealthy shareholders rather than spreading throughout the population.\n\nThe reasons are simple. In the U.S., shareholders are mostly corporations, pension funds and wealthy individuals . And wealthy people in the U.S. are almost invariably white .\n\nSixty-six percent of white families own stocks , while less than 40% of Black families and less than 30% of Hispanic families do. Even when comparing Black and white families with the same income, the race gap in stock ownership remains.\n\nThese disparities stem from the same historical disadvantages that result in lower Black homeownership rates. Until the Civil War, virtually no Black person could own property or enter into a contract . After the Civil War, Black codes - laws that specifically controlled and oppressed Black people - forced free Black Americans to work as farmers or servants.\n\nState prohibitions on Black people owning property , and public and private theft of Black-owned land , kept Black Americans from accumulating wealth.\n\nThat said, the Trump tax cuts hurt low-income taxpayers of all races.\n\nOne way they did so was by abolishing the individual mandate requiring all Americans to have basic health insurance. The Affordable Care Act, passed under President Barack Obama, launched new, government-subsidized health plans and penalized people for not having health insurance.\n\nDepartment of the Treasury data shows almost 50 million Americans were covered by the Affordable Care Act since 2014. After the individual mandate was revoked, between 3 million and 13 million fewer people purchased health insurance in 2020 .\n\nEnding the mandate triggered a large drop in health insurance coverage , and research shows it was primarily lower-income people who stopped buying subsidized insurance from the Obamacare exchanges. These are the same people who are the most vulnerable to financial disaster from unpaid medical bills .\n\nGoing without insurance hurt all low-income Americans. But studies suggest the drop in Black Americans' coverage under Trump's plan outpaced that of white Americans . The rate of uninsured Black Americans rose from 10.7% in 2016 to 11.5% in 2018, following the mandate's repeal.\n\nThe Trump tax cuts also altered how the Internal Revenue Service calculates inflation adjustments for over 60 different provisions. These include the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit - both of which provide cash to low-wage workers - and the wages that must pay Social Security taxes.\n\nPreviously, the IRS used the consumer price index for urban consumers , which tracks rising prices by comparing the cost of the same goods as they rise or fall, to calculate inflation. The government then used that inflation number to adjust Social Security payments and earned income tax credit eligibility . It used the same figure to set the amount of income that is taxed at a given rate.\n\nThe Trump tax cuts ordered the IRS to calculate inflation adjustments using the chained consumer price index for urban consumers instead.\n\nThe difference between these two indexes is that the second one assumes people substitute cheaper goods as prices rise . For example, the chained consumer price index assumes shoppers will buy pork instead of beef if beef prices go up, easing the impact of inflation on a family's overall grocery prices.\n\nThe IRS makes smaller inflation adjustments based on that assumption. But low-income neighborhoods have less access to the kind of budget-friendly options envisioned by the chained consumer price index.\n\nAnd since even middle-class Black people are more likely than poor white people to live in low-income neighborhoods , Black taxpayers have been hit harder by rising prices.\n\nWhat cost $1 in 2018 now costs $1.26 . That's a painful hike that Black families are less able to avoid.\n\nThe imminent expiration of the Trump tax cuts gives the upcoming GOP-led Congress the opportunity to undertake a thorough reevaluation of their effects. By prioritizing policies that address the well-known disparities exacerbated by these recent tax changes, lawmakers can work toward a fairer tax system that helps all Americans.\n\nBeverly Moran , Professor Emerita of Law, Vanderbilt University\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

      "text": "Here's Why I Love Iran  -  Even When My Country Sees It as an Enemy\n\nI was living in Harlem.\n\nIt was a few weeks after 9/11 and when Mahsa rang and let me know that she would be in New York, I was happy and excited.\n\nHer brother and I had been friends for over ten years.\n\nWe always said our meeting was destined.\n\nAs the only two kids of color-I am Black American and he is Persian-in an otherwise all-white Women in Religion class at DePaul University, something in my heart knew he would be my friend for life. I'll never forget the look of agony in his big blue eyes when after opening the door to that crammed classroom he encountered a sea a white faces looking back at him, no one budging to indicate they would make room as he courageously closed the door behind him, turned and bared the stark gaze of the tall, lanky, pasty professor with the thick Eastern European accent, intensifying the mood with \"Why don't we wait to continue since some of us don't know how to get to here on time.\"\n\nSomehow in that moment, our eyes locked and I hurriedly moved my bag and beckoned him to come sit next to me. Shaun made his way through the sea of kids, barely letting him through the tight aisles. By the time he sat down, sweat trickling from his brow, he was relieved and I was relieved for him and we both laughed under our breath. When he rifled through his bag looking for a pen and couldn't find one-another long pause from our professor-we both laughed again as I handed him one of mine.\n\nWe become one in that moment, representing a warm cocoon of support to protect us through the white supremacist death by a thousand cuts that can choke and kill with its vicious silences and pauses that wither you from the inside out and have no balm but the knowing, empathetic understanding that laughter and friendship can heal.\n\nEven though he was born in Iran, I here in America, we had many things in common. He was organized into his understanding of Whiteness in Wilmette and I got my credentials in Fairfield, Connecticut. Different places, same stuff. Our families were the only people of color in extremely affluent communities and the day to day experiences, that remind you every day of how alien and unlovable you are, would leave their mark on our psyches, well after we'd graduated high school and found one another in that classroom at DePaul University.\n\nGetting together was healing. He and his cousins became fixtures at my house whenever there were barbeques, family get-togethers and parties. When I met Shaun I didn't know much about Persian history and culture, just what I remembered from what became known as the \"hostage crisis,\" and the Shah of Iran, years before.\n\nI was eight years old when a group of Iranian college students shut down a building in a place called Tehran. They were holding fifty or so Americans inside the embassy and wouldn't release them until their demands were met. My mother said the students were standing up for themselves because America was \"doing them like they do us\" and \"they know how it is.\" My mom and the Iranian kids seemed to be on the same page because at some point, soon after the \"crisis\" began, the students released the women and the Black Americans, let them walk right out of the embassy. It made so much sense and I was so impressed with the reasonableness of their actions. \"Women hold a special place in our society and Blacks live under American oppression and tyranny.\"\n\nEven though the white broadcasters tried to reduce the gesture to a publicity stunt, watching those people march out of the building, the women coming home to their children and the Black Brothers with their afros, coming home to their families, after that the students had my vote. And I got the message, for the first time in my life, that Black people in America had something in common with Black people and other people of color, all over the world.\n\nWe were one.\n\nThe students knew it. They said it for everyone to hear and now I knew it too.\n\nHanging out with Shaun reminded me of that. We had good times together and my mom and dad adored him, treated him like he was one of their own. We danced, partied, ate as much barbeque as we could hold, had great cocktails and just enjoyed life together. My parents taught him how to play Bid Whist, Black folk's version of Bridge. Going to Shaun's place, either his parents' house out in Wilmette or his apartment down the street from our place in Lincoln Park, was just the same. Just good times. When he cooked, my gosh, the food was magnificent! Well-seasoned meats with fresh, delicious herbs, perfectly cooked fluffy rice with these gorgeous, aromatic dips and sauces. The art on his walls was impeccable and the energy in his apartment was always flowing. Like my family, Shaun was hospitable, caring, a lovely conversationalist and knew how to have a good time, and he cared about people.\n\n[[{\"type\":\"media\",\"view_mode\":\"media_original\",\"fid\":\"635682\",\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"\",\"class\":\"media-image\",\"height\":\"1524\",\"style\":\"width: 400px; height: 300px;\",\"typeof\":\"foaf:Image\",\"width\":\"2032\"}}]]\n\nPhoto Credit: CODEPINK\n\nWe had so many things in common.\n\nSo of course, years later when his baby sister Mahsa came to New York, I was excited to host.\n\nShe arrived, smartly dressed like a low-key, genius poet in her well-tailored men's sports jacket, a black turtleneck, jeans and expensive but understated loafers. Mahsa had always been elegant and gorgeous. We walked down to People's Choice, the most delicious homemade Jamaican food in New York City. I think we got oxtails with peas and rice and cabbage. Neither one of us could get over how extraordinarily delicious the food was. We ate and we talked about her work and mine. We'd all since left Chicago, years ago. Shaun to Los Angeles, me to New York City and Mahsa to Tehran. She'd done a women's magazine, Bad Jens, and had become a serious organizer of community over there. On this trip she was working at the UN with Shirin Ebadi, doing translation work for her papers, books and speeches. Even though Mahsa was really humble about it, which was her way, I knew from her proud brother that her work with Shirin Ebadi was a really big deal.\n\nSince 9/11 had just gone down, and Bush was pushing us to go to war with Iraq, I took the opportunity to make sense of all that had happened in that part of the world. \"Why are we always fighting and complaining about Iraq and Iran?\" I asked as we chomped away. \"And what's the deal with Afghanistan?\" I admitted to her something that I had hidden from myself, that even though I was pretty active in international situations that impacted Black people and people of color globally, Haiti, South Africa, Venezuela, that I knew very little about the Middle East. It just became something that was always already happening... so ongoing that I just tuned out. Mahsa was one of those people, that even though she was crazy smart, brilliant really, you didn't have to pretend that you knew something that you did not.\n\nShe explained about the oil. She explained about the pipelines. She explained the grip of American imperialism, the destruction of the cities of Middle Eastern antiquity and the pillaging of museums and libraries by American armed forces throughout the years and the slow, steady march to Iraq that the U.S. was directing to Iran. That seemed outlandish to me, that Iran would ever be treated in that fashion. When she started talking about the incessant bombing, the destruction of Beirut came up and I informed her that back in the early '80s, Black folks likened the most cracked-out, left behind areas of our own communities to this city, \"South Side of Chicago lookin' like Beirut,\" I'd hear brothers and sisters say.\n\nMahsa shook her head and smiled slightly and then gave me a glimpse of the history of the beauty and majesty of this gorgeous Lebanese city. She was clearly disturbed by the information, but her gentle, non-judgmental telling of these things, in a tone demonstrative of patience and inner peace, her deep intellect and elegance, amplified a sense of what Americans did not know or like to think about, that ours was a young, foolish country... a big, ignorant, bully baby and that we had lost our way. Completely. Most of us unaware of what was really happening in our names, and for oil, imperialism and what Bush kept calling \"our way of life,\" around the world, especially in the Middle East, with people, who like my mother'd said all those years ago \"know how it is.\"\n\nWe do not like to even consider what we have destroyed and in that destruction what has been lost, forever, to the world. What we have lost is friendship, culture, love, peace, endless possibilities and all of the wonderful things that come from life when you are trying to crush, kill, and control. Somewhere along the way, in a quest for assimilation, peace and acceptance, and just probably worn downness, Black Americans forgot too, that we have something in common with our brothers and sisters in the Middle East. The greatest blow from the War Economy is that it separates us. Eventually, it separated Shaun and I... understandably. After all, it is difficult to maintain friendships with folks when your country makes habit of lying, stealing, cheating, murdering and spreading hate, making their lives here and back home, a misery.\n\nAmerica was and still is running around, destructively taking... snatching things... from people, with whom Black folks, Native people, LatinX in the land known as the United States have something in common.\n\nAs I look at the bombed-out streets of the countries that the United States has attacked, and ripped apart, dusty, dirt heaps where gardens used to grow, I have to look at my own communities, here in the United States. Areas with no green spaces or parks and the prisons swollen with human energy relegated to slavery. Flint, Michigan, with no drinkable water source, Deep East Oakland with nowhere to buy living foods and soil so destroyed by pollution that you can't grow any... children climbing out of tents in homeless encampments in downtown Oakland, while tech millionaires look down on them from their sprawling condo apartment windows. The United States is waging the same war on the people of the Middle East, that it is waging here on Black folks, LatinX, Indigenous people and poor Whites, here in our local communities.\n\nThis truth takes me back to that look on Mahsa's face when she told me of the beauty of precious Beirut and the pure glory of what stood there before the dust and the rubble.\n\nI have always had the sense that being reminded of what we have in common, (in addition to being targeted by the most destructive force on the planet... the American government...) would create a solidarity that could truly organize peace on its own, between the people most heavily enslaved, marginalized and victimized by the virus of War Economy which spreads by keeping us fearful of one another and separates us. I have always had the sense that if the Black and LatinX children on the South Side of Chicago understood that the bullets flying by and through their heads and the food deserts in which they reside are a construction of the engineers of the War Economy, which inflict death upon all that they cannot control, as they do today to the children of Yemen and Afghanistan, and God forbid, Iran, that they would have a different sense of their possibilities and self-worth in the world. I have always had the sense that if we remembered what the Iranian students were really saying and doing when they released the folks who \"suffered under American oppression and tyranny,\" just like they did... that we would all be unstoppable... together... because knowing that we all have something in common is the first step towards growing and sustaining a local peace economy.\n\nThe good news is that we get a chance to start again, everytime we open our eyes and begin a new day.\n\nWhen I tell people that our government is ramping up to a war with Iran, a glaze comes over their eyes. It's like yelling fire in a crowded theater but nobody moves because they're too busy enjoying their buttered popcorn and watching the movie... so you have to start explaining that fire not only burns... but it can kill you.\n\nGet up and run!\n\nAre we that used to waging war in America that no one even bats an eye?\n\n[[{\"type\":\"media\",\"view_mode\":\"media_original\",\"fid\":\"635683\",\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"\",\"class\":\"media-image\",\"height\":\"750\",\"style\":\"width: 400px; height: 473px;\",\"typeof\":\"foaf:Image\",\"width\":\"634\"}}]]\n\nPhoto Credit: CODEPINK\n\nOr is it because Iran is this faraway place where they're not like us... and practice a different religion... have different values... a place where the people have nothing in common with us? This glaze over the eyes thing has happened so much that I have to wonder what has happened in my life that makes me understand that loving the Iranian people is as natural as loving my own people... as natural as knowing that they are my people.\n\nWondering why my fellow countrymen and women do not connect in the same way has shaken me up a little... a lot... and had me thinking about why I love Iran.\n\nI want to dedicate this piece to Mahsa Shekarloo, who left our world on September 5, 2014. May all the girls and women, around the world and especially Iran... Persia, know that she organized, loved and sacrificed so that they could be free. And to her dear brother, Arash, aka Shaun, who is my friend... for life.\n\nLearn more and join CODEPINK's We Love Iranians campaign here .\n\nThis article was produced by Local Peace Economy , a project of the Independent Media Institute."

      "text": "'Check yourself': Potential Trump VP pick slammed for 'better off during Jim Crow' comment\n\nDuring a fiery floor speech on Wednesday, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-New York) took the gloves off in addressing Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Florida) over remarks he made suggesting Black Americans were better off during the Jim Crow era than they are today.\n\nDonalds made the comment while stumping for former President Donald Trump in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in an effort to court Black voters to the GOP's side. According to Newsweek , Donalds reminisced fondly about the Jim Crow era in which Black Americans were systemically discriminated against and experienced routine brutality from whites.\n\n\"You see, during Jim Crow, the Black family was together. During Jim Crow, more Black people were not just conservative - Black people have always been conservative-minded - but more Black people voted conservatively,\" Donalds said. \"And then [the former Department of Health, Education and Welfare], Lyndon Johnson - you go down that road, and now we are where we are.\"\n\nWhile House of Representatives' decorum doesn't allow for members to attack other members on the floor by name, Jeffries ripped Donalds without actually once saying the Florida Republican's name.\n\n\"A so-called leader has made a factually inaccurate statement that Black folks were better off during Jim Crow. That's an outlandish, outrageous, and out of pocket observation. We were not better off,\" Jeffries said.\n\n\"When a young boy named Emmett Till could be brutally murdered without consequence because of Jim Crow we were not better off. When Black women could be sexually assaulted without consequence because of Jim Crow, we were not better off. When people could be systematically lynched without consequence because of Jim Crow, we were not better off. When children could be denied a high-quality education without consequence because of Jim Crow, we were not better off,\" Jeffries continued. \"How dare you make such an ignorant observation.\"\n\nWith a nod to the hip-hop culture of his home district in Brooklyn, Jeffries added told Donalds, \"You better check yourself before you wreck yourself.\"\n\nDonalds is considered to be on the short list of potential running mates for Trump, given that he's from the state where Trump is domiciled, his reputation as a staunch MAGA Republican and his propensity for defending Trump in public. Rep. Donalds was one of the multiple Republican elected officials who traveled to Manhattan to attack Judge Juan Merchan, witnesses and jurors outside of the courthouse where Trump stood trial.\n\nOther potential Trump running mates include House Republican Conference chair Elise Stefanik (R-New York), Sens. Tim Scott (R-South Carolina) and J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy. The former president is expected to announce his 2024 vice presidential pick prior to the Republican National Convention, which kicks off on July 15 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\nWatch video of Jeffries' remarks below, or by clicking this link ."

      "text": "A lifetime of racism makes Alzheimerâs more prevalent in Black Americans\n\nChapter Five\n\nBy KAT STAFFORD\n\nPhotos by WONG MAYE-E and video by NOREEN NASIR\n\nFREDERICKSBURG, Va. â Constance Guthrie is not yet dead, but her daughter has begun to plan her funeral.\n\nIt will be, Jessica Guthrie says, in a Black-owned funeral home, with the songs of her ancestors. She envisions a celebration of her motherâs life, not a tragic recitation of her long decline.\n\nAs it should be. Constance has lived 74 years, many of them good, as a Black woman, a mother, educator and businesswoman.\n\nBut she will die of Alzheimerâs disease, a scourge of Black Americans that threatens to grow far worse in coming decades.\n\nBlack people are more likely to develop Alzheimerâs than white people in the United States. They are less likely to be correctly diagnosed, and their families often struggle to get treatment from a medical system filled with bias against them.\n\nAbout 14% of Black people in America over the age of 65 have Alzheimerâs, compared with 10% of white people, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The disparity is likely even more, because many Black people arenât correctly diagnosed.\n\nAnd by 2060, cases are expected to increase fourfold among Black Americans.\n\nWhile some risk factors may differ by race, the large disparities among racial groups canât be explained just by genetics.\n\nThe problems start much earlier in life. Health conditions like heart disease and diabetes are known risk factors. Both are more common among Black populations, because of where they live in relation to polluting industries, lack of healthy food choices, and other factors. Depression, high blood pressure, obesity and chronic stress can also raise the likelihood of developing Alzheimerâs. So can poverty.\n\nAcross the board, Black people donât receive the same quality of health care throughout life as white people.\n\nSo they donât get high quality treatment â or any treatment â for all those conditions that are risk factors. Then, at the end, theyâre less likely to get medication to ease the symptoms of Alzheimerâs and dementia-related disorders.\n\nAnd thereâs the insidious impact of a life experiencing racism.\n\nRacism is trauma that can lead to increased stress, which can in turn cause health problems like inflammation, which is a risk factor for cognitive decline, said Dr. Carl V. Hill, chief diversity, equity and inclusion officer of the Alzheimerâs Association.\n\nâBut because of this structural racism that creates poor access to health, medication, housing, those who experience racism and discrimination are not provided a pathway to lower their risk,â Hill said.\n\nIt is, he said, âa one-two punch.â\n\nFor Jessica, it has meant the final years of her motherâs life have been filled not with peace, but heartache and frustration, as she navigates doctors who donât believe her when she says her mom is suffering. In the slow, plodding walk that is her motherâs final years, she has few health care partners.\n\nâIt has been pervasive across multiple doctors, emergency rooms and hospital doctors,â Jessica said. âNot being listened to, not believed, not given the full treatment.â\n\nâTo be a caregiver of someone living with Alzheimerâs is that you watch your loved one die every day. Iâve been grieving my mom for seven years.â\n\nThe salon was called âHair by Connie,â and for 18 years it was the place to go in Alexandria, Virginia, if you were a Black woman who wanted to look her best. Reigning over the shop was its owner, Constance Guthrie.\n\nShe traveled the world, attending hair shows. She opened her salon to fashion shows like the âTall, Full and Sassyâ event advertised in an old flyer she now keeps in a box of mementos. She donned dazzling, colorful and flamboyant outfits to match her larger-than-life personality.\n\nIn the 1990s, she made the difficult decision to move and close her beloved salon. She bought a home in Fredericksburg so her daughter could attend the best schools, and later became a paraprofessional in the local school district, which allowed her to have a schedule where she never missed oratorical contests or choir recitals.\n\nShe was always there for Jessica, who is her only child. They often stayed up into the wee hours of the night working on school projects together. Despite meager means, Jessica grew up surrounded by encouragement and love.\n\nâMy mother gave up everything to make sure that I had the greatest support, the greatest opportunities,â Jessica Guthrie recalled. âWe were like two peas in a pod.â\n\nHer motherâs hard work paid off. Jessica became a teacher and later moved to Dallas to build her own life and chase her dreams, where she was a successful chief program officer for an education service.\n\nThen, seven years ago, Constance began her descent into dementia.\n\nShe started to forget simple things, like where her keys were. She lost her way coming home from work on a familiar route she traveled almost daily for 18 years. She got into a car accident.\n\nThe frequency of troubling incidents began to increase, worrying Jessica who was still hundreds of miles away in Texas.\n\nThey tried to use Post-It notes to remind Constance of daily tasks. Some of the colorful notes still line the walls of the familyâs home.\n\nFor a woman who had grown accustomed to being so independent, it was hard for her to accept that she needed help.\n\nâShe spent so long trying to hide it,â Jessica said. âLike, âOh, Iâm good, Iâm fine. I just forgot.â But you could tell that a lot of her anxiety and stress was because she was trying to cover this up from other people.â\n\nShe began to wander around her neighborhood. Jessica and nearby loved ones tried to bolt the door to prevent her from wandering.\n\nA neurologist confirmed she was suffering early cognitive decline and that it was likely Alzheimerâs.\n\nShe was just 66 when she was diagnosed.\n\nSoon after, Jessica made the tough decision to pack up and leave Dallas behind to care for her mother full time. She recently began working remotely again after taking an extended leave of absence to care for her mother.\n\nConstance never had diabetes nor high blood pressure â which are common risk factors. She was fairly active and healthy, and would often walk around her neighborhood. But in 2015, Constance suffered a transient ischaemic attack, or a âmini stroke,â which is a brief disruption in the blood supply to part of the brain.\n\nJessica believes the mini stroke could have been caused in part by the heavy stress her mother endured at her job, where she worked for 18 years as a special education paraprofessional.\n\nShe also questions the role genetics played in her motherâs diagnosis. Her motherâs aunts are all living with the disease. Her motherâs brother, who was a doctor, has started to experience cognitive decline.\n\nLost in her own mind, Constance can no longer testify to the difficulties she endured â as a mother, a Black entrepreneur running a business on her own.\n\nBut her daughter, Jessica, can attest to the struggles sheâs had, as a Black caregiver, trying to ensure that her mother receives appropriate care.\n\nIn 2018, her mother started pointing at her stomach, repeatedly, trying to tell her daughter she was in pain. Jessica took her to her primary care physician, who is white and brushed the concerns aside.\n\nâMy mother couldnât articulate that there was significant pain in the moment and the doctor of the practice basically said, âOh, well, you know, sometimes they just come in and put on a show and it seems like sheâs fine,ââ Jessica said.  âThey asked, âAre you sure sheâs in so much pain?ââ\n\nThey sent her home without performing further diagnostic tests. But the pain persisted.\n\nJessica took her mother to the emergency room the next day and a Black male doctor ordered the necessary imaging. She needed emergency surgery to correct a painful, protruding hernia.\n\nThen there was the time she took her mother to the emergency room for intense leg pain. She had arthritis in her knee but Jessica suspected something more serious.\n\nThe doctor told her she likely just needed rehab for her bad knee. Jessica advocated for more testing and it turned out Constance had a blood clot in her leg.\n\nJessica Guthrie cares for her mother, Constance Guthrie, at home.\n\nâRacism is implicit and deeply rooted in the air that we breathe,â said Jessica, who has started an Instagram account to chronicle her experiences.\n\nThe problems Black people face getting medical care are pervasive. Black people living with serious illnesses get less help managing pain and other symptoms, and they have worse communication with doctors, according to the Center to Advance Palliative Care.\n\nStudies show they are less likely to receive dementia-related medication that can help ease symptoms like hallucinations and depression that make the disease particularly terrifying for families.\n\nAmong non-white caregivers, half or more say they have faced discrimination when navigating health care settings for their care recipient. Their top concern: Because of their race, providers or staff do not listen to them.\n\nAnd there are barriers to even being diagnosed properly. A recent study found that Black participants in Alzheimerâs disease research studies were 35% less likely to be diagnosed than white participants.\u000b\u000bPart of the problem is a lack of Black doctors. Just 1 in 3 of the nationâs physicians is Black, Indigenous, Hispanic or Asian. That lack of representation has had a compounding effect on the care that Black people receive â especially later in life when older Americans suffering from illnesses like Alzheimerâs lack the ability to advocate for themselves.\n\nAll these things put an outsized burden on Black families providing care.\n\nThrough her Instagram, Jessica regularly hears from other Black caregivers, mostly women, who have eerily similar stories of not being heard, feeling isolated or being denied proper treatment.\n\nâI think that part of my journey would have looked significantly different if I were a middle-aged white person or a white male,â she said. âI would have been listened to the first time.â\n\nJessica has spent the past several months preparing for her motherâs imminent death, making sure every detail is perfect.\n\nBut in an unexpected twist, she learned in February that her mother would be discharged from home hospice care in early March. Medicare typically covers hospice care for those who are terminally ill, with a life expectancy of six months or less.\n\nAlthough she remains in the last stage of Alzheimerâs disease, Constance has been deemed stable.\n\nBoth her appetite and water intake are great. Her skin is glowing. She still has glimmers of her sassy spirit.\n\nOn the surface, this is good news. Jessicaâs relishing every extra day she has with her mother.\n\nStill, the discharge feels like a slap in the face.\n\nSeveral studies have found that Black patients, across various serious illness diagnoses, are less likely to be referred to hospice or use hospice.\n\nLosing hospice services means Jessica will lose all equipment and supplies, including the hospital grade bed that her mother sleeps in, the lift she uses to get her out of bed and her wheelchair. She has lost the weekly nurse visits, vital checks, the social worker and the extra services that her mother loved â music and massage therapy.\n\nJessica is concerned about how sheâll handle the next medical emergency. Sheâll have to rely on local hospitals that provided her mother with problematic care before.\n\nâEverythingâs gone and it feels like Iâm back at square one again,â she said. âI feel like the systemâs failed us and has failed so many other caregivers.â\n\nItâs the latest, but maybe not the last, burden, and itâs taking its toll.\n\nAt 34, many of her friends are married, starting families, traveling and investing money for the future.\n\nBut sheâs had to spend money on her motherâs care and largely put her life on hold.\n\nâWhen you think about how I spent so long trying not to repeat this cycle of poverty, now Iâm sitting in a place where I make a pretty good salary, and yet Iâm not setting myself up for the future that I know that I should have,â she said.\n\nSome days she mourns the life that could have been and everything she has had to sacrifice. She sees undeniable parallels between all that her mother sacrificed and what she now has given up. But she wouldnât change a thing.\n\nHer exhausting experience as a caregiver has added purpose to her life. She feels she is also helping other Black caregivers to be seen and heard.\n\nFor now, she is happy to spend time with the woman she calls âCG.â\n\nEvery morning after Constance wakes up, Jessica flips on the TV in her motherâs small room to the gospel music station. âMusic brightens my mom. She would sing no matter if she was on key or not.â\n\nNow, the daughter sings to her mother as sheâs changing or feeding her. On a recent day Jessica tried making it through âTake My Hand, Precious Lord,â as she massaged her motherâs fingers, before her voice cracked and her shoulders bounced as she cried.\n\nâYou saying goodbye?â her mother mumbled.\n\nConstance doesnât sing or clap along anymore, but she lightly tapped her feet under her blanket. And she let out a low, steady hum.\n\nProducers: Samantha Shotzbarger, Josh Housing, Wong Maye-E\n\nData Analysis: Angeliki Kastanis\n\nText Editing: Anna Jo Bratton, Andale Gross\n\nGraphics: Kevin S.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nFILE - National Urban League president and CEO Marc Morial speaks at the National Urban League Annual Conference, July 22, 2022, in Washington. Black Americans have endured considerable injustices and barriers to prosperity and equality throughout U.S. history. But their social, economic and political advances in the past 60 years have been unsatisfactory. That's according to a new annual study on racial progress, called the \"State of Black America.\" (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Black Americans have endured considerable injustices and barriers to prosperity and equality throughout U.S. history. But their social, economic and political advances in the 60 years since the enactment of major civil rights legislation have been unsatisfactory, according to a new annual study on racial progress.\n\nThe \" State of Black America \" report by the National Urban League, which has compiled research and analysis on the status of Black Americans in the U.S. for decades, cites legal challenges to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and backlash to efforts meant to advance racial progress such as affirmative action and diversity, equity and inclusion policies for decelerating progress.\n\n\"Doors have been opened in higher education, government and the private sector in that sixty year period. That's important. Every measure shows progress,\" National Urban League President Marc Morial said, in an interview with The Associated Press ahead of the report's release Friday.\n\n\"But I would have thought we would have been much further along than we are in 2024 with respect to achieving a sense of parity in America,\" Morial said.\n\nIn an AP interview, National Urban League president Marc Morial says there was a big push to promote equality after the 2020 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, but now opponents are putting up new barriers.\n\nDespite significant economic advancement over several decades, the report also highlights numerous barriers to economic advancement. The result, the report's authors write, is persistent economic and political disparities. The racial income gap has been virtually unchanged for more than 20 years, with Black Americans making on average 64% of the income of white people, the report notes.\n\nSimilarly, the study highlighted barriers in opportunity. For instance, Black students are still more likely than their white counterparts to have uncertified and inexperienced teachers. At the same time, the number of Black students dropping out of primary education has decreased from 13.1% in 2000 to 3.9% in 2024.\n\nThe view of Black civic participation is also mixed. While the percentage of Black Americans registered to vote stood at 69% in 2020 compared to 64% in 2000, the percentage of Black people who voted in 2022 stood at 42.3%, a drop from 54% who cast ballots in 2002.\n\nAt the current pace, it would take anywhere from one to three centuries for most Black Americans to achieve parity with their white peers, depending on their region of the country, according to a February study by the McKinsey Institute for Black Economic Mobility.\n\nAnd while major institutions, including top corporations, governments and media have increased the number of Black leaders in their ranks, such efforts are being limited as diversity and inclusion initiatives face court challenges, public backlash from conservative activists and restrictions by some state and local Republican lawmakers.\n\n\"Notwithstanding the effort to move forward, there's always been a movement of resistance to that progress and that resistance has played a role in decelerating the progress that we need to make on the journey to parity. We see it being played out right now, \" Morial said in reference to issues such as political gerrymandering, book-banning in schools and attacks on diversity policies.\n\nMorial pointed to the current U.S. Supreme Court, which he said \"has demonstrated a hostility to the tools necessary to correct the long history of racial discrimination.'\n\nThe Urban League's study also evaluates President Joe Biden's performance in office and finds his administration's efforts fall short of promises made to Black Americans, even as the president faces significant opposition from Republican lawmakers and some in his own party.\n\nThe report, however, broadly approves of Biden's policy agenda. A record-low Black unemployment rate, as well as efforts to expand health-care access and affordable housing for Black Americans are signs of progress, the authors wrote.\n\nStill, the \"political opposition\" that blocked the enactment of policies considered top priorities by Black Americans, such as voting rights and policing reform, are major letdowns.\n\n\"We are in a world of deep attack by an ideological extreme that wants to erase so much of the civil-rights movement,\" said Maya Wiley, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and co-author of the study.\n\nKristen Clarke, assistant attorney general for civil rights in the Justice Department, said federal watchdogs are ready to ensure the nation's civil rights laws are being followed.\n\n\"We've been working across the country to reach underserved communities so that we understand the problems that communities face,\" Clarke said in an interview with the AP. \"Our country thrives when everyone has a voice in our democracy and we remain vigilant and work to counter voting discrimination and voter suppression wherever it rears its ugly head.\"\n\nOn the eve of the Bloody Sunday anniversary events commemorating voting rights marches in Selma, Alabama this weekend, Morial called on federal officials to increase their efforts to protect civil rights and to better support sociopolitical advances in the Black community.\n\n\"This moment is a reminder about our obligation to confront voter suppression and continuing threats that we see when it comes to access to the ballot box,\" he said.\n\n____\n\nMatt Brown is a member of the AP's Race and Ethnicity team.

Most Black Americans are likeliest to say that they experience racial discrimination regularly and that such experiences inform how they view major U.S. institutions, according to a new study from the Pew Research Center released Monday, June 10, 2024. The study seeks to highlight the country's documented racist history against Black people as a possible explanation for why Black Americans hold conspiratorial views about major U.S. institutions. (National Archives via AP)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Most Black Americans say they've experienced racial discrimination regularly or from time to time, which colors how they view U.S. institutions like policing, the political system and the media, according to a study on conspiracy theories.\n\nThe study released Monday by the Pew Research Center examined the intersection of race and conspiratorial beliefs. It's the second installment in the research group's series on how Black Americans see success and failure .\n\nThe study defines racial conspiracy theories as ideas that Black Americans might have about \"the actions of U.S. institutions\" that aren't necessarily the stated goals of the institution. The study stresses that these are claims that Black Americans may have because of America's documented history of racist policies largely impacting Black communities. Pew examined claims including conspiratorial beliefs about how major institutions discriminate against Black Americans and support for generational adages such as \"you have to work twice as hard\" to advance compared with white Americans.\n\nFor instance, the study found that more than 8 in 10 Black Americans surveyed agreed with the statement that \"Black people are more likely to be incarcerated because prisons want to make money on the backs of Black people.\" And more than 6 in 10 Black adults surveyed agreed that institutions such as the criminal justice system, the country's economic system and policing are designed to hold Black people back.\n\nThose sentiments exist alongside a reality that Black people were 32% of sentenced state and federal prisoners in 2022 , even though they make up just 12% of the overall U.S. population. By comparison, white people were underrepresented among prisoners at 31%, while Hispanic people were slightly overrepresented at 23% of prisoners, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics.\n\nPew's study draws from a poll of Black Americans conducted last September. Study authors say that views are unlikely to have shifted since the respondents were surveyed.\n\nThe study also explored why Black adults believe these narratives and allowed respondents to explain how they feel about discrimination and racial disparities in their own words, said senior Pew researcher and study author Kiana Cox.\n\nShe added that although the survey was released during an election year it does not focus on partisan politics. Rather, it showcases the feelings Black Americans have that can influence how the community views the nation but often go unheard or aren't taken seriously.\n\n\"There are anecdotal conversations among Black people about the system, the Man, the invisible hand, the agenda that is set out to create a situation where Black people can't advance. So, we wanted to explore that,\" Cox said. \"We also wanted to figure out how many Black people are familiar with these narratives about the system being designed for their failure and how many Black people believe them.\"\n\nAmericans are far from impervious to conspiratorial thinking dating back to the founding of the nation , a legacy that has gained new life as the internet supercharged communication and, often, the spread of misinformation and hoaxes . The Pew study notes that Black Americans have a unique relationship with both discrimination and claims of government conspiracy theories given the nation's legacy of slavery, Jim Crow era segregation laws and modern day discrimination against Black Americans by public and private actors.\n\n\"When you have a history of American institutions actually conspiring against Black people, it's not so hard to believe that anything else would also be true,\" said Tasha Philpot, a professor of political science at the University of Texas at Austin, who studies political psychology among Black Americans.\n\n\"Especially in the last few years where race has been pretty salient, it doesn't surprise me that people would say they are experiencing racial discrimination,\" she said.\n\nAmong Black adults who have experienced discrimination, about three-quarters said it made them feel as though the system as a whole was designed to keep them down. Black adults who have faced discrimination also felt varying emotions as a result - 76% felt angry overall, 53% said they worried about their personal safety, and 41% felt depressed, for example. Researchers surveyed 4,736 Black, multiracial Black and non-Hispanic, and Black and Hispanic respondents last September from across the country.\n\nBlack Americans were also likely to believe racial conspiracy theories about politics. Three-quarters of those surveyed said they agreed that \"Black public officials being singled out to be discredited more than white officials\" happens in politics today. In medicine, the survey found that 55% of those surveyed said they agreed with the statement that \"medical researchers experiment on Black people without their knowledge or consent.\"\n\nPhilpot said some Black Americans may still believe such theories, given documented episodes of discrimination such as the Tuskegee syphilis experiment and the exclusion of Black Americans from New Deal programs that benefited white Americans.\n\n\"It's not really a conspiracy theory if it's true,\" she said.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

(Daniel A. Varela/Miami Herald via AP, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Extreme views adopted by some local, state and federal political leaders who try to limit what history can be taught in schools and seek to undermine how Black officials perform their jobs are among the top threats to democracy for Black Americans, the National Urban League says.\n\nMarc Morial, the former New Orleans mayor who leads the civil rights and urban advocacy organization, cited the most recent example: the vote this month by the Republican-controlled Tennessee House to oust two Black representatives for violating a legislative rule. The pair had participated in a gun control protest inside the chamber after the shooting that killed three students and three staff members at a Nashville school.\n\n\"We have censorship and Black history suppression, and now this,\" Morial said in an interview. \"It's another piece of fruit of the same poisonous tree, the effort to suppress and contain.\"\n\nBoth Tennessee lawmakers were quickly reinstated by leaders in their districts and were back at work in the House after an uproar that spread well beyond the state.\n\nThe Urban League's annual State of Black America report released Saturday draws on data and surveys from a number of organizations, including the UCLA Law School, the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League. The collective findings reveal an increase in recent years in hate crimes and efforts to change classroom curriculums, attempts to make voting more difficult and extremist views being normalized in politics, the military and law enforcement.\n\nOne of the most prominent areas examined is so-called critical race theory . Scholars developed it as an academic framework during the 1970s and 1980s in response to what they viewed as a lack of racial progress following the civil rights legislation of the 1960s. The theory centers on the idea that racism is systemic in the nation's institutions and that they function to maintain the dominance of white people in society.\n\nDirector Taifha Alexander said the Forward Tracking Project , part of the UCLA Law School, began in response to the backlash that followed the protests of the George Floyd killing in 2020 and an executive order that year from then-President Donald Trump restricting diversity training .\n\nThe project's website shows that 209 local, state and federal government entities have introduced more than 670 bills, resolutions, executive orders, opinion letters, statements and other measures against critical race theory since September 2020.\n\nAnti-critical race theory is \"a living organism in and of itself. It's always evolving. There are always new targets of attack,\" Alexander said.\n\nShe said the expanded scope of some of those laws, which are having a chilling effect on teaching certain aspects of the country's racial conflicts, will lead to major gaps in understanding history and social justice.\n\n\"This anti-CRT campaign is going to frustrate our ability to reach our full potential as a multiracial democracy\" because future leaders will be missing information they could use to tackle problems, Alexander said.\n\nShe said one example is the rewriting of Florida elementary school material about civil rights figure Rosa Parks and her refusal to give up her seat to a white rider on a Montgomery, Alabama, bus in 1955 - an incident that sparked the bus boycott there. Mention of race was omitted entirely in one revision, a change first reported by The New York Times.\n\nFlorida has been the epicenter of many of the steps, including opposing AP African American studies, but it's not alone.\n\n\"The things that have been happening in Florida have been replicated, or governors in similarly situated states have claimed they will do the same thing,\" Alexander said.\n\nIn Alabama, a proposal to ban \"divisive\" concepts passed out of legislative committee this past week. Last year, the administration of Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, rescinded a series of policies, memos and other resources related to diversity, equity and inclusion that it characterized as \"discriminatory and divisive concepts\" in the state's public education system.\n\nOklahoma public school teachers are prohibited from teaching certain concepts of race and racism under a bill Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt signed into law in 2021.\n\nOn Thursday, the Llano County Commissioners Court in Texas held a special meeting to consider shutting down the entire public library system rather than follow a federal judge's order to return a slate of books to the shelves on topics ranging from teenage sexuality to bigotry.\n\nAfter listening to public comments in favor and against the shutdown, the commissioners decided to remove the item from the agenda.\n\n\"We will suppress your books. We will suppress the conversation about race and racism, and we will suppress your history, your AP course,\" Morial said. \"It is singular in its effort to suppress Blacks.\"\n\nOther issues in his group's report address extremism in the military and law enforcement, energy and climate change, and how current attitudes can affect public policy. Predominantly white legislatures in Missouri and Mississippi have proposals that would shift certain government authority from some majority Black cities to the states.\n\nIn many ways, the report mirrors concerns evident in recent years in a country deeply divided over everything from how much K-12 students should be taught about racism and sexuality to the legitimacy of the 2020 election.\n\nForty percent of voters in last year's elections said their local K-12 public schools were not teaching enough about racism in the United States, while 34% said it already was too much, according to AP VoteCast, an expansive survey of the American electorate. Twenty-three percent said the current curriculum was about right.\n\nAbout two-thirds of Black voters said more should be taught on the subject, compared with about half of Latino voters and about one-third of white voters.\n\nViolence is one of the major areas of concern covered in the Urban League report, especially in light of the 2022 mass shooting at a grocery store in Buffalo, New York. The accused shooter left a manifesto raising the \"great replacement theory \" as a motive in the killings.\n\nData released this year by the FBI indicated that hate crimes rose between 2020 and 2021. African Americans were disproportionately represented, accounting for 30% of the incidents in which the bias was known.\n\nBy comparison, the second largest racial group targeted in the single incident category was white victims, who made up 10%.\n\nRachel Carroll Rivas, deputy director of research with the Southern Poverty Law Center's Intelligence Project, said when all the activities are tabulated, including hate crimes, rhetoric, incidents of discrimination and online disinformation, \"we see a very clear and concerning threat to America and a disproportionate impact on Black Americans.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Julie Wright in Kansas City, Missouri, and Hannah Fingerhut in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Mallory Wyatt)\n\nNorma Upshaw, 82, was living alone south of Nashville, when her doctor said she needed to start in-home dialysis.\n\nHer closest family lived 40 miles away, and they'd already scrambled once when the independent senior living facility she had called home - a community of largely Black residents - had closed with 30 days' notice. Here they were searching, yet again, for an assisted living facility or maybe an affordable apartment that was closer.\n\nThey couldn't find either, so Upshaw's daughter built a small apartment onto her home.\n\n\"Most of her doctors, her church, everything was within Nashville,\" said Danielle Cotton, Upshaw's granddaughter, \"... this was the best option for us.\"\n\nNearly half of Americans over 65 will pay for some version of long-term health care , the landscape of which is quickly transitioning away from nursing homes and toward community living situations.\n\nBlack Americans are less likely to use residential care communities, such as assisted-living facilities, and more likely to live in nursing homes, CNHI News and The Associated Press found as part of an examination into America's long-term care options. The opposite is true for white Americans.\n\nThe disparity is well-known to those who work in and research assisted-living settings, and experts say the reasons why are complicated. Where to place a parent or loved one is driven in part by personal and cultural preferences, but also insurance coverage and physical location of residential care communities. All of these factors vary state by state, family by family.\n\nThe result is older Black Americans may be left out of living situations that can create community, prevent isolation and provide help with daily tasks while allowing for a level of personal independence.\n\n\"The bottom line is white, richer people have a solution now - which is these incredible assisted-living communities - and minorities and low-income people don't,\" said Jonathan Gruber, an economist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"That is the fundamental challenge facing our country as our demographics are shifting.\"\n\nThe AP and CNHI News analyzed data from the most recent National Post-acute and Long-term Care Study, published in 2020, and found Black people are underrepresented in residential care communities nationally by nearly 50%.\n\nBlack Americans account for about 9% of people over 65 in the U.S. But they are underrepresented in residential care communities at 4.9% of the population, and overrepresented in nursing homes - about 16% of residents.\n\nThe situation is flipped for white Americans, who make up 75% of Americans over 65 but are 88% of the people in residential care communities. The AP-CNHI News analysis also found that other ethnic and racial groups are underrepresented in assisted living facilities, but only Black Americans were also overrepresented in nursing homes.\n\nLacking a universal definition for assisted living, the federal study created the \"residential community care\" category to represent settings that serve people who cannot live independently, but also do not require the more comprehensive care provided in nursing homes.\n\nIn short, they're places where people can live and receive help with activities of daily living like bathing, dressing and managing medications, but do not provide round-the-clock nursing care.\n\nFinancial barriers affect low-income people of all races, experts said, but they're heightened for older Black Americans. Black workers make $878 weekly compared to $1,085 earned by white workers, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics , which shows this national gap has existed for decades.\n\nThat affects both the potential to spend on long-term care - and, earlier in life, homeownership rates. Many residents sell their homes to fund senior care, and more than 7 in 10 homeowners in the U.S. are white, according to 2020 U.S. Census Bureau data.\n\nOne month in an assisted living facility runs $4,500 a month or $54,000 a year , according to a national median cost from the National Center for Assisted Living, which represents assisted living providers.\n\nMost people pay privately, often through personal funds or long-term care insurance; nursing homes can be covered by Medicaid. That puts assisted living out of reach for many Black Americans, explained Cotton, who also founded and runs a Nashville nonprofit that helps financially strapped seniors find housing.\n\nShe said many can barely pay for government-subsidized housing, let alone expensive living communities: \"It leaves them in a gap. Those are the seniors that are really not even considered or thought about.\"\n\nIn Palo Alto, California, the nonprofit Lytton Gardens uses funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to subsidize housing costs for low-income assisted living residents. But the cost of care - scheduled meals, help with bathing and taking medications - is still on the individual.\n\nStaff have tried to reach Black and Hispanic seniors through social workers, libraries and senior centers. But the residents are still mostly white and Asian.\n\n\"Most of the time, I'm begging somebody to move in,\" said Donna Quick, housing administrator for Lytton Gardens. \"But it's just a matter of finding somebody who has the funds for this assisted living program.\"\n\nThe process of paying for long-term care is \"as opaque as it can be,\" said Linda Couch, senior vice president of policy and advocacy at LeadingAge, which represents nonprofit long-term care providers and researches long-term care . \"Because we don't have a comprehensive and cohesive long-term care financing system in this country, we are left with this patchwork,\" Couch said.\n\nResearchers' major question as more assisted facilities open up across the U.S. - are they located near Black communities? - is hard to answer, too.\n\n\"The federal government doesn't even have a list of assisted living (facilities),\" said Lindsey Smith, health systems management and policy researcher at the Oregon Health and Science University-Portland State University School of Public Health. \"There is not, like, a registration. When COVID hit, they did not have a list.\"\n\nLaShuan Bethea, executive director of the National Center for Assisted Living, said more research is needed to fully know whether fewer Black people accessing assisted living means they are missing out on needed care, or if they are finding that support in other ways.\n\n\"It's really important to do the work ... trying to understand: What does this mean when Black and brown people can't access assisted living, knowing what it brings in terms of quality and outcomes?\" Bethea said.\n\nWhile affordability is one determining factor, researchers say it doesn't completely explain why more Black people are not moving into assisted living.\n\n\"I think the other piece is that expectation that we want to keep people home as long as possible,\" said Candace Kemp of Georgia State University's Gerontology Institute. \"And within families of color, African American communities in particular, there's this desire to take care of family members.\"\n\nSteven Nash's father could afford the most expensive assisted living facilities, but the former judge wanted to stay home. So while Nash ran one of the nation's last remaining Black-owned nursing homes in the Washington, D.C., area, he also helped care for his father until he died at the age of 87.\n\n\"Even though it was very difficult for the family, we still kept that promise,\" he said. \"We try as hard as we can to honor the wishes of our elders.\"\n\nAs smaller nursing homes and facilities that once catered to Black residents closed, there's a cultural competency gap, Nash said. He pointed to the kitchen, where beloved cultural food options are removed in favor of generic menu mainstays.\n\n\"People want to live out their life the way they've lived,\" he said.\n\nThat's why the 95-year-old mother of Indiana state Sen. Gregory Porter still lives where she has for six decades, cared for by Porter, other family members and in-home health professionals. Porter's daughter has promised to care for him similarly as he ages, a commitment that gave him \"a level of comfort.\"\n\n\"It means a lot,\" Porter said. \"It gives you the will to live.\"\n\nBut for others, assisted living is an option for independence even as their daily needs grow.\n\nOlder Black Americans are twice as likely to have Alzheimer's or other dementias compared to older white people, according to the Alzheimer's Association. Nash said he's seen more Black Americans interested in assisted living for dementia care; he's even planning to open a targeted facility in the coming years.\n\nIn Texarkana, Texas, former lawyer Jay Cossey moved into an assisted living facility after multiple strokes more than seven years ago that caused him to lose most of his short-term memory. He's one of a handful of Black residents at a facility that is blocks away from his old apartment.\n\nHis church community urged the 70-year-old to move in, though his family in Alabama has pushed for him to come live with them.\n\n\"My brother came and said he wanted to take me home,\" Cossey recalled. \"I told him I am home.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nLeaders in various parts of the country of the National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association have decades of military and federal service between them as they watch attacks that began first on diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility programs (February xx) (AP Video: Sharon Johnson)\n\nCalvin Stevens, Air Force Reserve Veteran, poses outside his home in Decatur, Georgia on Thursday, Feb. 7, 2025.

(AP Photo/Olivia Bowdoin)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Evelyn Seabrook was able to buy a home even though she had only a high school diploma. Glenn Flood worked his way up the career ladder to become a public affairs officer for former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. And Calvin Stevens had a dual military and federal service career that took him to high levels in both.\n\nNow in their late 70s and early 80s, the three retirees are part of a generation of Black Americans who used the military and federal civil service to pursue the American dream. They acknowledge there were challenges. But they believe they received more opportunities in the military and as government employees than they would have in a private sector where racial discrimination and patronage were common at the time they were ready to enter the workforce.\n\n\"I am glad I chose to be in federal service,\" Seabrook said. \"Even with all the drawbacks, my personal life was enhanced by my federal job.\"\n\nSeabrook, Flood and Stevens have more than 120 years of combined military and federal service. As leaders in various capacities in the National Active and Retired Employees Association, they are plugged into the siege federal employees are under during the opening weeks of President Donald Trump's second term. It started with the elimination of programs promoting diversity, equity and inclusion and has expanded to a culling of the federal workforce under Elon Musk, a special adviser to the Republican president. Musk also seeks to eliminate agencies as head of the Department of Government Efficiency , or DOGE.\n\nThey say one thing being lost in the attacks on the federal workforce is its important history as a stepping stone into the middle class for minorities when paths were limited, in particular for Black Americans.\n\nSpeaking from their homes near Orlando, Florida, and in Decatur, Georgia, and Palm Springs, California, the retirees said when they came into the military and federal service decades ago, the push wasn't about diversifying the workforce. Rather, the opportunities were about ending the discrimination that left qualified people of color on the outside of many workplaces.\n\nThen-President Lyndon Johnson addressed the problem of employment discrimination through law and executive order. That opened the door wider to the U.S. Postal Service, the military and many other federal jobs where Black professionals got their first chance to pursue executive-level jobs, said Marc Morial, president and CEO of the National Urban League.\n\n\"The progress in federal civilian employment was far faster and far greater than it was in the private sector,\" which was \"far slower to create the opportunity to run nondiscriminatory hiring practices,\" he said.\n\nThe result was a rise in the Black middle class, especially in places like Washington, D.C., where workers entered the system in lower-level jobs but rose through the ranks based on performance, he said.\n\n\"At one point, DC had the highest median income for African Americans in any city in the country,\" Morial said.\n\nFor now, the federal government is the largest single employer in the U.S. with about 3 million workers, which includes 600,000 with the U.S. Postal Service but not the active duty military. While Black Americans are nearly 14% of the population overall, they make up nearly 19% of the federal workforce.\n\nSeabrook, 80, began her Social Security Administration career in New York City in 1966 and worked for the federal government for more than 39 years.\n\nThe irony of hearing and seeing DEI used as a signal for unworthiness is that there was no affirmative action or special programs to recruit people like her when she started working.\n\n\"The only initiatives I have seen was if you were a veteran\" and points were added to your test score, she said from her home in Florida. \"In terms of ethnicity, culture, race, that wasn't even part of the picture. We weren't thinking about it then.\"\n\nEven the full impact of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 came years after she started working. She took tests and those scores led to interviews. Preferences weren't \"part of my life or how I got promoted or not. I got promoted because I could understand the work. I never went in under incentive programs.\"\n\nHer own career path was not entirely smooth and included complaints to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Nevertheless, she continued moving up in positions and even helped train new employees.\n\n\"It certainly was very helpful in me maintaining a level of living that I probably could not have done elsewhere,\" Seabrook said.\n\nFlood, 78, was a Navy officer who also served in the reserves and at the Pentagon, where he was one of the regular briefers for former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. He said federal service was instrumental in helping people of color show their abilities.\n\nFlood said the times now are \"scary\" because of the impact on the federal workforce and how departments and agencies are responding to the administration's moves to gut them : \"There's important work out there, and not everything is in D.C,\" he said from his home in the Southern California desert.\n\nHis old department, Defense, issued instructions saying it would no longer acknowledge Black History Month, Native American Heritage Month or similar commemorations of culture and history. But he said recognizing that history is important to show how far certain groups have come.\n\nHis father also was in the Navy but could serve only as a steward.\n\n\"I am very proud of my civil service and my Navy career\" and its role in his \"middle-class life,\" Flood said. \"That was not something you could take lightly.\"\n\nStevens, 77, spent 31 years in the Air Force and Air Force Reserves and more than three decades with the General Services Administration. He, like Flood and Seabrook, said his experience wasn't always smooth, but that he had mentors who helped.\n\nAs his career went forward, he would take it upon himself to get whatever training he needed, paying out of his own pocket so he could advance. One goal was to serve as a role model and mentor for others, and he suggested that recruitment efforts include Historically Black Colleges and Universities in the Atlanta area, where he was based and now lives. He recalls people of color coming into the service with degrees, often advanced ones.\n\nHe realizes that some might have viewed him merely as an affirmative action hire, \"but I met the qualifications,\" he said. \"I was educated and I was trying to advance, taking classes on my own\" to train and prepare for each position he sought.\n\nStevens said his military and federal career gave him a blessed life, and that he is saddened to see the whole system under attack.\n\n\"A lot of people went to the federal sector because that was a middle-class opportunity,\" he said. \"Some did have degrees and some did not, but they felt that the government, their positions, were secure. They had benefits and they feel that they had a fair opportunity for promotion.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press video journalist Sharon Johnson in Atlanta contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nFILE - People listen during a rally in support of reparations for African Americans outside City Hall in San Francisco, Tuesday, Sept. 19, 2023. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File)\n\nSACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - California will formally apologize for slavery and its lingering effects on Black Americans in the state under a new law Gov. Gavin Newsom signed Thursday.\n\nThe legislation was part of a package of reparations bills introduced this year that seek to offer repair for decades of policies that drove racial disparities for African Americans. Newsom also approved laws to improve protections against hair discrimination for athletes and increase oversight over the banning of books in state prisons.\n\n\"The State of California accepts responsibility for the role we played in promoting, facilitating, and permitting the institution of slavery, as well as its enduring legacy of persistent racial disparities,\" the Democratic governor said in a statement. \"Building on decades of work, California is now taking another important step forward in recognizing the grave injustices of the past -- and making amends for the harms caused.\"\n\nNewsom signed the bills after vetoing a proposal Wednesday that would have helped Black families reclaim or be compensated for property that was unjustly seized by the government through eminent domain. The bill by itself would not have been able to take full effect because lawmakers blocked another bill to create a reparations agency that would have reviewed claims.\n\nCalifornia entered the union as a free state in 1850. In practice, it sanctioned slavery and approved policies and practices that thwarted Black people from owning homes and starting businesses. Black families were terrorized, their communities aggressively policed and their neighborhoods polluted, according to a report published by a first-in-the-nation state reparations task force.\n\nEfforts to study reparations at the federal level have stalled in Congress for decades. Illinois and New York state passed laws in recent years creating reparations commissions. Local officials in Boston and New York City have voted to create task forces studying reparations. Evanston, Illinois, launched a program to provide housing assistance to Black residents to help atone for past discrimination.\n\nCalifornia has moved further along on the issue than any other state . But state lawmakers did not introduce legislation this year to give widespread direct payments to African Americans, which frustrated some reparations advocates.\n\nNewsom approved a $297.9 billion budget in June that included up to $12 million for reparations legislation that became law.\n\nHe already signed laws included in the reparations package aimed at improving outcomes for students of color in K-12 career education programs. Another proposal the Black caucus backed this year that would ban forced labor as a punishment for crime in the state constitution will be on the ballot in November.\n\nState Assemblymember Isaac Bryan, a Democrat representing Culver City, called legislation he authored to increase oversight over books banned in state prisons \"a first step\" to fix a \"shadowy\" process in which the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation decides which books to ban.\n\nThe corrections department maintains a list of disapproved publications it bans after determining the content could pose a security threat, includes obscene material or otherwise violates department rules.\n\nThe new law authorizes the Office of the Inspector General, which oversees the state prison system, to review works on the list and evaluate the department's reasoning for banning them. It requires the agency to notify the office of any changes made to the list, and it makes the office post the list on its website.\n\n\"We need transparency in this process,\" Bryan said. \"We need to know what books are banned, and we need a mechanism for removing books off of that list.\"\n\n___\n\nSophie Austin is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

      "text": "High rates of asthma in black children linked to racist housing laws\n\nChapter Two\n\nBy KAT STAFFORD\n\nPhotos by WONG MAYE-E and video by NOREEN NASIR\n\nHARTFORD, Conn. â Amid the balloons, cake and games at his best friendâs birthday party on a farm, 5-year-old Carter Manson clutched his small chest.\n\nâHe just kept saying âI canât breathe, I canât breathe,âââ his mother, Catherine, recalled tearfully. âI picked him up and told him it was OK and to just breathe. Just breathe.â\n\nIt was the first time Carter had an asthma attack in public, and the inhaler he sorely needed was in the family car. Catherine calmed her terrified son and ran to get the inhaler; only then was Carter able to breathe easily.\n\nâYou say in your head as a parent that Iâm going to be prepared next time,â Catherine, 39, said.\n\nâBut anything can trigger them,â she said.\n\nBlack children are more likely to have asthma than kids of any other race in America. They're more likely to live near polluting plants, and in rental housing with mold and other triggers, because of racist housing laws in the nation's past. Their asthma often is more severe and less likely to be controlled, because of poor medical care and mistrust of doctors.\n\nAbout 4 million kids in the U.S. have asthma. The percentage of Black children with asthma is far higher than white kids; more than 12% of Black kids nationwide suffer from the disease, compared with 5.5% of white children. They also die at a much higher rate.\n\nAcross America, nearly 4 in 10 Black children live in areas with poor environmental and health conditions compared to 1 in 10 white children. Factories spew nitrogen oxide and particulate matter. Idling trucks and freeway traffic kick up noxious fumes and dust.\n\nThe disparities are built into a housing system shaped by the longstanding effects of slavery and Jim Crow-era laws. Many of the communities that have substandard housing today or are located near toxic sites are the same as those that were segregated and redlined decades ago.\n\nâThe majority of what drives disparities in asthma, itâs actually social and structural,â said Sanaz Eftekhari, vice president of corporate affairs and research of the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America. âYou can tie a lot of the asthma disparities back to things that have happened, years and years and decades ago.â\n\nAsthma is treatable. It can be managed with medicine, routine appointments and inhalers. But Black children often struggle to get treatment, and are more likely than white kids to end up in the emergency room with asthma symptoms.\n\nKamora Herrington, a community organizer in Hartford, Connecticut, doesn't need to study the statistics to know that the children of her city are suffering.\n\nâWe know that our emergency rooms in the middle of the night during the summer are filled with children who canât breathe,â Herrington said.\n\nThe prime cause, she said, is just as apparent.\n\nâPeople need to demand change for real and people need to not be reasonable. At what point do you say, this is bull - - - -? White supremacy and racism have everything to do with it.â\n\nThe stubborn mold spores reappeared, no matter how hard Catherine Manson scrubbed the walls of her apartment, outside of Connecticutâs capital of Hartford.\n\nAs the mold began to spread further throughout the home, it dotted the walls of the bathroom and even on the bottom of one of the familyâs sofas. Catherine became increasingly worried about her familyâs health, noticing both she and the kids were coughing more. Their nebulizer treatments became more frequent while they lived there, and Catherine herself was prescribed an albuterol inhaler and diagnosed with asthma.\n\nThe property was owned by two different landlords during the four years the family lived there. The first didnât attempt to fix the mold; the second tried, but failed, Catherine said.\n\nThe family thought the apartment would be a good place to raise their children. After all, it was in a relatively quiet neighborhood and affordable.\n\nBut as the mold worsened, the family increasingly felt stuck and unable to leave. It was at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and funds were tight. Catherine suspects the mold began to form because the owners failed to address a leaky roof. The family noticed water and moisture on the walls, whenever it snowed or rained.\n\nâI was so angry,â she recalled. âEverybody was lacking funds. There was nothing we could have done different.â\n\nThe family finally moved in 2021.\n\nItâs a common problem for Black families.\n\nThe nationâs discriminatory housing policies make Black Americans more likely to live in rental housing. Throughout the 20th century, federal housing policies promoted homeownership and wealth generation â but those benefits were largely inaccessible to Black families.\n\nRental units are much more likely to have deficiencies or inadequacies and fewer means to address problems that increase exposure to asthma triggers.\n\nIn Connecticut, more than half of Black households rent, compared with a quarter of white households. In Hartford, almost 7 in 10 Black households rent.\n\nAn Asthma Allergy Foundation of America report examining asthma disparities found that Black renters were more likely to report the presence of mice, cockroaches or mold in their homes. Black people also live in older housing at higher rates, exposing them to triggers like dust and mold. In Hartford, 63% of Black households live in structures built before 1960, according to DataHaven, a nonprofit community organization.\n\nâSo many of our children are living in these just utterly disrepair homes with mold, open cracks, leaking, and vermin,â said Dr. Jessica Hollenbach, co-director of the Asthma Center of Connecticut Childrenâs.\n\nPollution is also a major factor in asthma rates.\n\nIn Connecticut, poor neighborhoods in the stateâs five largest cities â Bridgeport, Hartford, New Haven, Stamford, and Waterbury â have high concentrations of kids with asthma.\n\nThose same communities are at a higher risk for chemical and environmental exposures that are known asthma triggers.\n\nA recent Environmental Protection Agency National Emissions Inventory shows Fairfield, Harford, New Haven and New London counties produced more than 10% of the stateâs total nitrogen oxide emissions. All four of the counties include census tracts with the highest combined asthma rates.\n\nNitrogen oxide gases are typically emitted from vehicle exhaust, coal, oil, diesel and natural gas burning and can cause health issues such as eye irritation and asthma aggravation.\n\nDr. Mark Mitchell, a former director of Hartfordâs health department and a founder of the Connecticut Coalition for Environmental Justice, has tried to sound the alarm on Hartfordâs asthma rates.\n\nThe coalition began investigating and advocating for environmental justice after concerns arose about a regional landfill expansion and possible links to high rates of asthma, cancer and other diseases in communities neighboring them. Mitchell recalled how, in the mid â90s, he examined about 30 kids and found that a third of them had asthma. He urged the state to look into what he believed was a clear pattern of disparities.\n\nâThey told me â¦ we donât really know who has asthma and doesnât have asthma, and besides, itâs not unusual for a third of inner-city kids to have asthma,â said Mitchell, who is now associate professor of climate change at George Mason University.\n\nThe stateâs health department did not respond to multiple requests for comment on its efforts to combat its asthma rates.\n\nMitchell said his research and work have led him to believe that the stateâs asthma rates are heavily tied to traffic-related air pollution, as well as other air pollutants.\n\nBlack people suffer the brunt of it. Exposure to pollutants â specifically, fine particulate matter â is often disproportionately experienced by Black and Hispanic populations, while the emissions are disproportionately caused by white populations.\n\nBetween 2018 and 2021, more than 21% of children in East Hartford had asthma â compared to 13% statewide, according to DataHaven .\n\nKamora Herrington has lived in Hartford for much of her life. She launched a gathering space, Kamoraâs Cultural Corner, for residents in a north-end neighborhood in Hartford â a mostly Black area of the city facing many socioeconomic challenges and the rippling effects of racism that have led to high poverty rates, poor health outcomes and shortened life expectancies.\n\nHerrington remembers that for decades, where a garden now sits, rows of milk delivery trucks would idle daily, pouring black smoke into the air and clouds of dust. Toxins seeped into the ground as trucks were also repaired on the lot. Across the street sat low-income apartments and multifamily houses; children played nearby. Theyâre still there today.\n\nThe ground is too toxic to plant in, so they use raised flower beds. Theyâre raising funds to do an environmental cleanup of the lot.\n\nBut she wonders about the health impact on generations of Black children who have traversed the neighborhood and the cityâs north end. While people may prefer to blame Black parents, saying they should make better choices for their families, she points to the years of inequities that have led people to live where they can.\n\nâAs a Black woman who is also a Black mother, I have experienced ridiculous amounts of blame and abuse from a larger system that understands theyâre culpable but understands that the issues are so big, that itâs a whole lot easier to say, âBlack mommy, youâre the problem,ââ she said.\n\nSince much of the cityâs rental housing stock predates the 1960s, Herrington noted, it often lacks air conditioning or proper ventilation â a burden on asthmatic children during hot summers.\n\nAbimbola Ortade, an activist and board member of Hartfordâs Black Lives Matter 860 chapter, recently lost his sister to COVID. Like many Hartford residents, she had asthma for most of her life, and diabetes, a combination that proved deadly. Ortade also has asthma, along with two of his children. He worries frequently about their future â and his.\n\nAsthma, Ortade said, is merely one example of how structural racism fuels health disparities that are likely to worsen as Black children go through life â including the toll of toxic stress on their mental health.\n\nâIn my neighborhood, youâve got to worry about the police killing you, stress killing you, heart failure or asthma killing you,â he said.\n\nOrtade is critical of elected officials and what he believes is a reluctance to truly address the disparities and root causes.\n\nAsthma, he said, âis like a ticking time bomb.â\n\nCarter Manson has an ally in the fight against asthma -- Caydence, his shy, 9-year-old sister.\n\nShe is fiercely protective and comes to his aid when his asthma is flaring.\n\nBut she, too, has asthma.\n\nCaydence Manson and her brother, Carter Manson, play in the garden of their relative's home.\n\nBlack kids have other things working against them when it comes to asthma risks.\n\nLow birth weight, which is highest among Black babies, is one risk factor.\n\nThe confluence of toxic stress, racism and discrimination that many Black people endure, heightens the risk of preterm births and low birth weights â and the disorders, like asthma, that may follow. These factors are present regardless of socioeconomic level.\n\nSegregated or low-income communities are less likely to have easy access to health care facilities or specialty medical clinics, which are predominantly in or next to white or higher-income communities.\n\nAdvocates say increasing representation of Black doctors â including pulmonologists, allergists, immunologists and researchers â is key to better care, eliminating bias and disrupting valid mistrust in doctors.\n\nCatherine Manson said itâs been challenging to find the right health care professionals to help control her kidsâ asthma.\n\nâI feel like the pediatricians are not as knowledgeable as they should be,â Manson said. âAs a parent, you have to make those decisions on your own. Iâm the advocate for my kids.â\n\nAsthma can be particularly disruptive for Black children and their families beyond its health implications, creating a trickle down effect in other facets of their lives.\n\nCarter, and his 9-year-old sister Caydence who also has asthma, have missed weeks of school, leaving them behind in schoolwork. And in turn, their parents were forced to miss work to care for them â putting a strain on the familyâs finances.\n\nâIâm the parent, the teacher, the nurse,â Catherine said, of the toll. âIt feels like youâre kind of failing them.â\n\nFirst: Catherine Manson holds back her tears while recounting a time when her son, Carter Manson, suffered an asthma attack at a friend's birthday party. Second: Catherine Manson sits on the front porch of her aunt's home while her children, Caydence Manson, middle, and Carter Manson, play close to her.\n\nThere have been efforts to bring asthma under control.\n\nDr. Melanie Sue Collins, director of the Pediatric Pulmonary Fellowship and Cardiopulmonary Lab at Connecticut Children's, pointed to the hospitalâs Easy Breathing program, which involves more than 330 pediatricians in more than 90 practices in Connecticut and has been adapted for use in schools.\n\nMore than 150,000 children have been screened and more than 41,000 have been diagnosed with asthma. The program focuses on improving diagnosis rates and creating a standardized approach to help keep asthma under control.\n\nâI think the biggest issue is that asthma is a chronic disease that requires care every single day,â she said. âAnd what I see many of my patients and families struggling with is the basic needs of life.â\n\nHUSKY Health, which includes the stateâs Medicaid and the Childrenâs Health Insurance Program, covers about 22% of the state population.\n\nOn a federal level, resources have been put toward various housing and health grant programs. An Asthma Disparities Subcommittee was formed by the National Institutes of Health in 2010 and published a federal action plan in 2012. And the Affordable Care Act broadened coverage access for millions.\n\nBut advocates say more asthma-specific legislation and funding is needed. Overall asthma rates have trended downward in recent years but rates among Black children remain outsized and disparate.\n\nIn Connecticut, the prevalence of asthma in the stateâs public school system has slightly decreased over time but about 1 in 8 students have asthma. The incidence among Black students is about 50% higher.\n\nThat often means absenteeism â and in the near and long term, failure.\n\nâIf you miss school, you canât succeed in school,â Collins said of a fraught cycle many kids encounter. âAnd if you donât succeed in school, you have a really difficult time having a life where you can do things comfortably, whether itâs eating, having shelter or a successful job.â\n\nAfter seemingly endless years of stress, things are improving for the Manson children. Catherine has done well adhering to the childrenâs asthma control plan. The hard work appears to be paying off.\n\nCarter is playing flag football, something that would have been unheard of just a year ago, and Caydence is running track.\n\nCarter hasnât used his inhaler since last November. They havenât missed a day of school this year. Itâs a win his mother is proud of.\n\nStill, worry lingers in the background as the seasons change and potential triggers loom.\n\nâIâve missed work, their dad has missed work,â said Catherine, who now works in the medical field as a patient service representative, after leaving a beloved career in part to focus on her familyâs health.\n\nâBut you have to pay the bills. Then you miss work and you miss money and that comes out of your budget. It affects everything.â\n\nProducers: Samantha Shotzbarger, Josh Housing, Wong Maye-E\n\nData Analysis: Angeliki Kastanis\n\nResearch: Rhonda Shafner\n\nText Editing: Anna Jo Bratton, Andale Gross\n\nGraphics: Kevin S.

(AP Photo/Winslow Townson, File)\n\nA majority of Black Americans say being Black is central to how they think about themselves and shape their identities, even as many have diverse experiences and come from various backgrounds, according to a new report by Pew Research Center. About three-quarters of Black people said so despite where they come from, their economic status or educational backgrounds.\n\nOverall, 14% say being Black is only somewhat important to their identity and 9% say it has little to no impact, highlighting the diversity of thought among Black Americans, which include U.S.-born Black people and Black immigrants, and different ethnicities, political party affiliations and ages.\n\nPew Research Center released its report on Black identity on Thursday, and the results pinpoint the critical role race plays in shaping identity in the U.S.\n\n\"What our data suggests to me is that being Black is important to all Black people, according to our findings, regardless of the intersections of their identity,\" said Kiana Cox, research associate and co-author of the report. A \"majority of Black people, 76%, said that being Black was really important to them.\"\n\nCox, who has worked with Pew Research Center in Washington, D.C., for about four years, said they wanted to make sure they had a large enough sample to \"get this kind of nuance within racial and ethnic groups, but also to understand sort of life and society as Black people understand it.\"\n\nShelly Eversley, a professor at The City University of New York, said the 76% of survey respondents who consider their Blackness important to their identity was still less than she would expect it to be because \"race informs every asset of Black life.\"\n\n\"Understanding the way race informs daily life is protection for a lot of Black people,\" said Eversley, who has taught about race for 20 years and is interim chair for the Department of Black and Latinx Studies. She was not a participant in the report.\n\nShe said being Black is something you are aware of at a young age. Black children are often disciplined harder at school and other places, and their parents tend to have conversations with them about the dangers of racism when they are still young, she added.\n\nThe report also points to how the importance that people place on being Black fosters a sense of connectedness among communities, Cox said.\n\nPeople who say that being Black is an important part of their personal identity were more likely to express a sense of connection with Black people in their local communities, in the U.S. and around the world than those who said Blackness is relatively less important.\n\nThere are 47 million Black people in the U.S., about 14% of the population, according to the 2020 census. Most Black adults in the U.S. where born in the country, but an increasing portion of the population is comprised of immigrants, about 12%. Of the Black immigrant population, 90% were born in the Caribbean or Africa.\n\nCox also said she was shocked to learn that place - or where people grew up and were living - played a large role in identity and how people shaped their values and what they viewed as important issues.\n\nBlack Americans cited violence and crime, along with economic issues such as poverty and homelessness as the most important issues to address in their communities, according to the report. The most important local issues named across subgroups of Black Americans does vary but often violence and crime, economic issues and housing issues rank among the top three.\n\nOverall, 17% of Black Americans said the most important issue is violence or crime - a category that includes drug activity, theft and vandalism, among other offenses. Eleven percent cited economic issues as the most important, 7% cited housing and 6% cited COVID-19 and public health. Nearly half of Black adults said local leaders are most responsible for addressing these important issues.\n\nA separate poll conducted in March by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research revealed an overwhelming majority of adults say more progress is needed in achieving equal treatment for Black people in dealings with police and the criminal justice system. That's two years after protests against the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis sparked a racial reckoning across the country.\n\nWhen asking about community issues, the survey used an open-ended question, so \"the answer of what Black Americans think is important is a little more multilayered than just violence or crime,\" Cox said, noting that there is so much more that goes into that category than police violence.\n\nThe report also showed that about half of Black people who say being Black is crucial to personal identity feel very or extremely informed about the history of Black people in the U.S. Of that group, about half say they learned that history from family and friends. A large majority, regardless of how Blackness shapes their personal identities, say they have spoken to their families about their own history.\n\n\"The clarity in which family as a source of history for both U.S. Black history, like the kind of history we expect to learn in school, and ancestral history, what we learn about our family histories, was very interesting. It came through so strongly,\" Cox said. \"What that is telling us, is it confirms what scholars and historians have told us about the strength of family for Black Americans, especially in terms of greater knowledge.\"\n\n___\n\nThe survey of 6,513 U.S. adults, including 3,912 Black Americans, was conducted Oct. 4-17, 2021. It uses a sample drawn from Pew Research Center's American Trends Panel and Ipsos KnowledgePanel, which are designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for Black respondents is plus or minus 2.8 percentage points.\n\n___\n\nMumphrey, who reported from Phoenix, is a member of the AP's Race and Ethnicity team.

      "text": "'You Have to Scream Out'\n\nBeing Black and disabled is a constant struggle.\n\nW hen Angel Love Miles arrived at Penn State in 1998, she realized she was going to have to fight to finish school. To begin with, Miles was a low-income Black student, and Penn State was mostly white. In addition, she has spina bifida, a condition that affects spinal development in utero. In Miles's case, this means she uses crutches or a wheelchair.\n\nAs a child, she had gone to a school for children with disabilities. Her school had an accessible playground with wheelchair swings, physical and occupational therapists, and a shop where she could get her wheelchair or crutches fixed.\n\nPenn State was different. There was a van for students with disabilities, but waiting for it often made her late for class. She remembers waiting once for the campus bus. When she asked the driver to lower the wheelchair ramp for her, he said, \"I don't want you on my bus,\" and drove away.\n\nShe pushed for the services she needed, and eventually, she finished college and went on to get her doctorate in women's studies. Today she's a social-justice advocate and policy analyst who specializes in intersectional and critical disability theory approaches.\n\n\"I became an advocate not because I wanted to but because I had to, to survive,\" Miles told me. \"I was not very outspoken at all. But if you're trying to get home and the bus keeps passing you up because you're in a wheelchair, you have to scream out.\"\n\nMiles's story is emblematic of what it's like to be Black and disabled in America: Every day is a struggle to not get left behind.\n\nAccording to American Community Survey data, 14 percent of Black Americans have a disability, compared with 12.6 percent of the overall population. Thirty-six percent of disabled Black Americans live in poverty, compared with 26 percent of all disabled Americans. Disabled Black people often have to battle harder to get correct diagnoses and services. This is especially true for \"invisible disabilities\" such as autism, which educators are more likely to dismiss as behavioral issues in Black children than in white ones.\n\nBlack people with disabilities are especially likely to have issues with police officers, who can misinterpret their behavior-such as a deaf person who keeps walking when told to stop-as a threat. When law enforcement assumes a Black person's failure to comply is because of aggression rather than a disability, the consequences can be deadly. Black Americans in general are 2.5 times as likely as white Americans to be killed by a police officer.\n\nFatal police shootings of people\n\nshowing signs of mental illness\n\n6 deaths per million\n\n4.4 deaths per million\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\nBlack\n\nWhite\n\nSource:\n\nThe Washington Post\n\nNone of this is that surprising. For centuries, white Americans treated Black people as less than human, as bodies valued only for the work they could do, Jane Dunhamn, the director of the National Black Disability Coalition, told me. Today Black people with disabilities are still doubly marginalized, by both racism and ableism. While America has undergone social and racial reckonings with the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements , we've yet to see something similar with the disability movement. Many disability activists want to change this narrative but wonder why it's taking so long. What does this failure say about us as a society?\n\nI n many ways, the disability-rights movement was modeled after the civil-rights movement. Americans with disabilities used to be tucked out of sight in asylums and institutions, or even put on display at the circus. In the 1940s and '50s, disabled World War II veterans pressured the government to provide services such as vocational training and rehabilitation. In the '60s and '70s, activists fought for disabled children to be included in schools instead of relegated to institutions and asylums, and lobbied the government to make public spaces more accessible with measures such as ramps and curb cuts on sidewalks. In 1973, Congress passed the Rehabilitation Act; Section 504 mandated equal opportunity for employment and prohibited discrimination against the disabled by any entity that received federal funds. Some of the language in the law came straight from the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\nBut for years it wasn't enforced. In 1977, disability-rights activists staged protests across the country to push the government to act, including a four-week sit-in at the San Francisco office of the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Kitty Cone, one of the organizers of the sit-in, wrote, \"We felt ourselves the descendants of the civil rights movement.\" She described how disability activists drew inspiration from the civil-rights movement's sit-ins, and even sang freedom songs to keep their spirits up during their protests.\n\nThe Black Panthers, in an effort led by the group member Brad Lomax, who had multiple sclerosis, brought meals and other supplies to the protesters. Lomax was part of a delegation to Washington, D.C., that pressured the government to write regulations laying out what constituted discrimination, instead of leaving the interpretation of Section 504 up to judges.\n\nFifteen years later, the landmark Americans With Disabilities Act broadened these reforms to include compliance in private institutions and workplaces. But even today, many spaces remain inaccessible. And Black people with disabilities face many subtler kinds of exclusion.\n\nLeroy F. Moore Jr., a Black activist with cerebral palsy, told me it is isolating to be Black and disabled. Many in the Black community don't understand what it is like to have a disability. He spent most of his career in the nonprofit world, where his mostly white co-workers didn't understand the experience of being Black in America. \"I was caught between two worlds,\" he told me.\n\nAs a result of these experiences, Moore helped found the disability-justice movement in the 2000s. Whereas previous disability activism focused on gaining rights, disability justice takes into account how identity-race, ethnicity, gender, class, and sexual orientation-affects a disabled person's experience, and how ableism intertwines with other systems of oppression. This approach is crucial, Moore told me, because race plays an enormous and still-underappreciated role in the experience of a disabled person who is a member of another minority group.\n\nBlack people with disabilities often struggle more than their white peers, whether it's to get a diagnosis or services, or to simply be seen as individuals. Austin Haynes is a 24-year-old operating-room nurse at Penn Medicine who struggled for years with undiagnosed ADHD. Haynes is Black and attended a primarily white high school in New Jersey. He always had a feeling that something was different: He had trouble concentrating, and studying felt harder than it should. \"I had to reread things multiple times,\" he told me, \"and if someone made a noise, I would be completely gone.\" He graduated from high school with a 2.5 G.P.A.\n\nWhen he was a sophomore in college, Haynes read about ADHD and realized that he might have it himself. He finally got a diagnosis, a prescription for Adderall, and studying strategies, which helped him focus and raise his grades. He graduated from college and enrolled in a nursing program, graduating with a 3.4 G.P.A. Sometimes he wonders why getting help took so long: \"Why did I have to not excel in school even though I knew I was smart enough?  I knew I had the capability to do so much better. And I think race had a huge role in not being diagnosed properly.\"\n\nSystemic racism and ableism don't just result in denied services and poorer outcomes. Jevon Okundaye, a 24-year-old Black man with autism, worries that one day he'll be stopped by a police officer and his lack of eye contact will be perceived as a threat. Okundaye, who graduated from Tufts University in 2019 with a degree in English and Africana Studies and works now as a fellow focusing on race and disability for the nonprofit group Massachusetts Advocates for Children, carries an autism ID card in his wallet but isn't sure that will offer any protection. \"If I were to pull it out in a panic, a police officer might think I'm reaching for a weapon,\" he told me. Okundaye hopes that if the cops ever stop him, they'll give him a chance to explain his diagnosis.\n\nSome Black disability activists I spoke with lamented the movement's failure to understand how identity, particularly race, complicates disability. Racism and ableism are similar, in the sense that they foist society's limitations-in imagination and in empathy-onto individuals who don't look or act like everyone else. Keith Jones, a Black activist with cerebral palsy, drove home this point: \"Am I the problem, or is society the problem?\""

      "text": "The Source of Black Poverty Isn't Black Culture, It's American Culture\n\nAmericans don't want to imagine that our racist history is actually an ongoing, racist reality.\n\nAmericans don't want to imagine that our racist history is actually an ongoing, racist reality. We like to look at racism as a thing that has gotten better (if not gone away completely) and that the way black Americans are treated in society is actually colorblind. So, if forced to pick between the idea that our country's structures and systems are biased toward white people or the idea that black communities are flawed, many pick the latter. Some doing so, of course, because they're racist.\n\nThe past week has seen an extended and thoughtful debate between New York 's Jonathan Chait and The Atlantic 's Ta-Nehisi Coates over whether cultural forces within the black community are to blame for its enduring poverty. (Links to the various points of the debate are at right.) It began after Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan referred to a culture in the inner city where \"generations of men\" are \"not even thinking about working\" - remarks broadly seen as racially controversial. Coates' first post largely took aim at President Obama's similar remarks putting blame for poverty on black culture. Chait, responding, indicated that many other Democrats agreed with Obama's position (as distinct from Ryan's). Over three more posts, the argument grew more refined, as I'll outline.\n\nHere is what is beyond dispute: In 2012, 35 percent of blacks lived in poverty , compared to 13 percent of whites. In 1970, those rates were 33.6 percent and 10 percent , respectively. Poverty in the black community is higher, and has been consistently.\n\nThere exist three options for that persistence, if we assume that culture might play a role.\n\nThis distinction isn't simply rhetorical. If there are cultural forces at play, one of those three things must be true. What's more, the political implications of each are different. If the black culture explanation is correct, it suggests that admonishments against the behavior of black Americans - the sort of thing that Coates has consistently objected to - are a proper response to entrenched poverty. If there's a culture of poverty, there needs to be a broader cultural realignment among all poor people, one that's not limited to the black community. If there are no internal cultural forces at play, then the \"racism exists\" explanation becomes more significant.\n\nPut more simply, there are three options for why black people continue to experience higher levels of poverty: it's in part black people's fault, it's in part poor people's fault, and it's society's fault. The best answer, without question, is the latter.\n\nLet's say, for the sake of argument, that the problem lies with the second option, that there is something about being poor that results in future generations being poor.\n\nIf this culture exists, what are its components? Ryan's remarks offer one view: it involves \"men not working and just generations of men not even thinking about working or learning the value and the culture of work, and so there is a real culture problem here that has to be dealt with.\" Or, put more crassly, parents who have been out of work take refuge in the welfare state, living on food stamps and government services, and their children learn that this is a viable means of survival.\n\nLast November, the National Bureau of Economic Research published a study suggesting that the children of people who receive government benefits are more likely themselves to receive such benefits. \"[W]hen a parent is allowed [benefits], their adult child's participation over the next five years increases by 6 percentage points,\" its summary reads. \"This effect grows over time, rising to 12 percentage points after ten years.\" (The conservative National Review embraced the argument, unsurprisingly.)\n\nThe study - conducted by looking at Norwegian, not American, benefits usage - found a relationship. But the noticeable uptick in the likelihood of children signing up for benefits programs was to the effect of being 1-in-16 or 1-in-8 more likely to do so. That's hardly a suggestion there is necessarily or even probably a transfer of the inclination to avoid work over generations.\n\nThere simply isn't a strong argument to be made that identifies attributes of enduring poverty from attributes common to the black community. Chait never presents one clearly.\n\nIn fact, in his most recent response to Chait, Coates argues that his opponent confuses the first and second options, conflating black culture with the culture of poverty. Here is what Chait wrote, in the closest approximation of a definition of that culture, and citing a paper linked in this essay by Jamelle Bouie .\n\nCoates' point, in part, is that Chait is pointing to things that are primarily specific to communities of color as being representative of the culture of poverty at large. But, further, that blurring that line tends to happen more when the \"roots of poverty\" being identified are more rampant in the black community.\n\nPerhaps another assumption is in order. Let's assume instead that the black culture option is the correct explanation. That pathology actually is something reserved for black people.\n\nBut again: What are the components of that culture? Paul Ryan got in trouble because he implied that the problem was, in short, laziness. Coates frames it loosely in similar terms - \"black people are less responsible, less moral, or less upstanding\" - which Chait quickly steps away from, preferring the gauzy expression \"cultural norms that inhibited economic success.\" The paper cited by Chait indicates a number of very specific behaviorisms and attitudes, some of which he notes, but it also downplays the idea of \"culture\" as an organizing force.\n\nThe clean overlap with longstanding anti-black stereotypes embodied in the Ryan argument and in Coates' formulation is the problem. It's what got Ryan in trouble. And it's why, from the outset, the black culture formulation should be considered suspect.\n\nIn his most recent post, Coates makes an exhaustive argument demonstrating the lengthy history of racist policies and programs that existed to help white Americans at the expense of black Americans. Chait presents the evolutionary repeal of programs explicitly targeting blacks as progress - the end of slavery, the end of Jim Crow. Coates presents it as refinement, as a softening and blurring of the approach society takes toward putting the interest of whites over blacks. It's the Lee Atwater-ization of institutional racism, manifested on the front page of The New York Times - on the same day that Coates published that essay - in the form of expanded voting restrictions that would keep more black (Democratic) voters from getting to the polls.\n\nBelieving that black culture is primarily at fault means believing that black cultural attitudes are why the black unemployment rate has always been at least 50 percent higher than white unemployment. It likely means assuming that vague, hard-to-identify and complex cultural attitudes are responsible for most of the things on this bulleted list : flat wages, higher rates of arrest for possession of marijuana, higher rates of incarceration, a greater likelihood of being arrested at school, a lower likelihood of being accepted to top-tier colleges. When The Wire noted that black preschoolers are more likely to be expelled from their preschool programs, multiple people wrote in to blame the black culture of single parenthood. It was blamed on black culture.\n\nIs black culture why this 2003 study found that job applicants \"with white-sounding names are 50 percent more likely to get called for an initial interview than applicants with African-American-sounding names\"? American history demonstrates countless examples of racist obstruction of black economic success. Ongoing examples show countless ways in which black Americans are still obstructed in the same way.\n\nIn his essay, linked to by Chait, Jamelle Bouie makes the point that certain aspects of behavior might influence certain aspects of the fight against poverty. But he then makes a critical ancillary point: that the addressing the systemic problems that obviously block black success - like the intentional neglect of poor urban communities - should happen regardless. \"'Culture' might explain the reluctance of individual households and families to leave\" those communities, he writes, \"but it's of limited utility when it comes to the broad phenomenon. In that case, the starting point should be the fact that African Americans deal with a unique set of durable circumstances that have festered and worsened over the last forty years.\" The dominant white culture articulated by Coates and that neglected those communities is the more obvious problem.\n\nIs this so impossible to imagine? America was born with sin and keeps sinning. No matter how fervent your belief in the perfection of the American ideal, you've certainly met enough Americans to know that the ideal may not always be met. Racism is the simplest answer and racism, of all theories, is the one with a robust evidentiary trail.\n\nFinally, consider this: The poverty level in the Hispanic community was 33 percent in 2012. In 1970, the figure was 24.3 percent. Poverty is entrenched in the Hispanic community. Do we blame black culture? Latino culture? Maybe we should consider that Coates is right, and admit that America needs to fix itself before it starts trying to fix the cultures it has spent a long time breaking."

      "text": "Black History Month Isn't Making Life Better for Black Americans\n\nHeroes like Frederick Douglass and Rosa Parks feel like characters in a novel-a world away from the clicking locks and nervous glances that plague millions of ordinary people.\n\nI'd experienced it before, but it was especially palpable one morning when I had to run around two white women out for a walk at a high school track. I felt the need to shrink-to make myself small and move past them at a distance comfortable to us all. If they perceived a threat-albeit, one clad in a Harvard shirt, \"Go Navy\" shorts-it could turn out rather poorly for me. So my body language, involuntarily and quite naturally, conveyed passivity. Of course, I'd done or said nothing that should have made them feel endangered, but the presence of my blackness in a space where they hadn't expected to encounter it placed the onus on me to make them comfortable.\n\nThis is what it feels like to be black in America. It sounds like the symphony of locking car doors as I traipse through a grocery store parking lot, armed with kale chips and turkey bacon. It looks like smiling when I don't feel like it. It's the instinct to enunciate differently, to use acceptable methods of signaling that I am safe to engage, or at least to disregard. \"We wear the mask that grins and lies,\" wrote the poet Paul Laurence Dunbar . I feel that mask covering my soul, never allowing me to just freely exist.\n\nI could argue that any negative reaction to my skin is a problem for others to grapple with and of no concern to me. I've tried that approach before; one memorable attempt ended with me being pulled out of my car by two police officers and handcuffed for the felonious infractions of having a blown headlight and insufficient self-abasement. It is an unspoken rule that blackness' first and most important task is to make everyone feel safe from it. We ignore this mandate at our own peril, realizing that a simple misunderstanding is a life or death proposition.\n\nJonathan Ferrell ran towards police seeking help after a car accident and was given a hail of bullets for his troubles. Renisha McBride went in search of a Good Samaritan after her accident and a shotgun blast answered her knock. Teenager Trayvon Martin walked home with candy and tea and was greeted by the nervous trigger finger wrapped in an adult's gun. Jordan Davis sat in a car outside a convenience store listening to music and a man who objected to the volume cut his life short with the boom of a firearm. The principal crime all of them committed, like countless others over the centuries, was being black and not sufficiently prostrating themselves to ensure the comfort of others.\n\nAs Black History Month ambles on, the heroic contributions and monumental achievements of black Americans take center stage. We remember these champions and the bouts they fought, but they're presented as extraordinary human beings-legends whose anomalous stories don't neatly translate to everyday interracial encounters. As I move around the country, the behavior that greets me is usually more influenced by the black faces that fill crime-ridden local newscasts than the exceptionality of Charles Drew, James Baldwin, or Thurgood Marshall. The great black women and men who populate Black History Month celebrations feel like characters in a novel-a world away from the black guy a few steps behind you in a barren parking garage.\n\nIn short, exceptions tend to prove the rule. A detached appreciation of Harriet Tubman and her Underground Railroad does not change the way drivers react when they pull up alongside a car full of black teenagers at a stoplight-or the purse-clutching that occurs when I pass women at the train station.\n\nWhat gets lost in the gleam of these once-in-a-generation personalities and tip-of-the-iceberg events is the dull ache in the glacier below. A closer examination of those hidden feelings always seems to elude the nation, even during this month of spotlight. It's the genesis of the uncomfortable silence that hangs in the air whenever someone attempts to begin a conversation on race. The prerequisite for honest dialogue is an admission that blackness is uncomfortable to others, and that this fact influences the behavior of us all.\n\nCombating this harmful notion is hard work. The threatening caricature of blackness spans hundreds of years. It dates back to the laws that prohibited large gatherings of slaves, out of an irrational fear that any such congregation would lead to a dastardly plot to kill white men and rape their women. It carries through the subtle implications in the \"analysis\" of a dreadlocked black football player's post-game exuberance. The public face of black America is dominated by the tragedy porn of male criminality and recidivism, welfare mothers with babies by multiple men, and dilapidated neighborhoods with shiftless neighbors. All of this reinforces the notions that make blackness threatening to Americans of other cultures.\n\nEstablishing Black History Month was a significant achievement, but the next step is to snatch history from the wind and plant it in the personal narratives of black Americans. The names subjected to rote February recitations intersect with personal, everyday stories. Black Americans should use the month as a time for deeper, and more public, exploration of their own journeys in an attempt to combat the lazy labels plastered on the black experience.\n\nDiscovering our stories means engaging our elders and partaking in the oral tradition that characterized black narratives for centuries. It means tending to the branches of our family trees-even those pruned by the blades of slavery-and using technology to fill in the gaps. It means placing our existence in the larger context of black and American history. This is what gave Alex Haley's Roots such power. This is what's behind the advent of the DNA-based genealogy businesses that seek to tell bits of the stories lost to the ages. This is the catalyst for television shows and documentaries that explore personal stories through a historical lens. And this is why our black president speaks of the impossibility of his story happening anywhere but here.\n\nSuch an approach looks like the black adolescent in his Sunday best reciting a famous oration of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and following it with a rigorous reply to the age-old question familiar in the black community: \"Who are your people?\" And then sharing that answer with the nation.\n\nWhen we tell our stories, we, and our history, become more vivid, and accessible, to all. We animate the historical texts, giving character to the facts, emotions to the events, and humanity to our heroes. And we give others a chance to recognize our shared human condition. As they get to know the stories of ordinary black people, their default emotion upon encountering blackness will bend away from fear.\n\nI'm not foolish enough to believe sharing my personal story will negate the stereotypes that surround me. But I'm certain that when people are not engaged in this way, they are boxed in generalities that do nothing to advance human relations. We find ourselves trying to live confidently, but remain cognizant that we are only allowed so much freedom of expression. Writing in The Atlantic in 1897 , W.E.B. Dubois described this state of perpetual balance as twoness: \"an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.\"\n\nI ran past those ladies without incident. And I lapped them a couple times before I finished my run and prepared to leave. As I was gathering my things, another man began his jog on the track and the women greeted him with a \"good morning.\" The fact that my departure was noticed, but disregarded, felt like a small victory. Only a mutual desire to engage would've lessened the burden I packed up and took with me.\n\nTo finally free ourselves from the bubble of preemptive apologies that attends the threat of blackness, we need to tell our stories. And Black History Month is as good a time as any to start."

      "text": "When Black Voters Exited Left\n\nWhat African Americans lost by aligning with the Democratic Party\n\nDays before the 1960 election, Coretta Scott King received a call from then-candidate John F. Kennedy while her husband was in a Georgia jail, charged with trespassing after leading a sit-in demonstration against segregation in Atlanta. \"This must be pretty hard on you, and I want to let you both know that I'm thinking about you and will do all I can to help,\" Kennedy told her. The Democratic nominee's brother and campaign manager, Robert Kennedy, called a DeKalb County Judge and successfully lobbied for Martin Luther King Jr.'s release.\n\nThe personal call and the timely intervention significantly bolstered Kennedy's standing among black voters. They also strengthened the political alliance between the Democratic Party and African Americans. After his release, King praised Kennedy for exhibiting \"moral courage of a high order.\" His father, the influential Baptist pastor Martin Luther King Sr., said, \"Kennedy can be my president, Catholic or whatever he is. I've got all my votes and I've got a suitcase and I'm going to take them up there and dump them in his lap.\" Kennedy earned 68 percent of the black vote, which was the decisive factor in key states such as Illinois, Michigan, and South Carolina.\n\nOnce in the White House, Kennedy faced pressure from civil-rights activists to make good on what King called a \"huge promissory note\" to pass meaningful civil-rights legislation. When President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, he cemented a political alliance between African Americans and the Democratic Party that continues to this day. But celebrating these landmark pieces of legislation makes it easy to overlook what black people in the United States lost when civil rights and equality for blacks were hitched to the Democratic Party.\n\nWhile the passage of the Civil Rights Act helped Johnson earn support from 94 percent of black voters in 1964, there is a gulf between what black Americans hoped the legislation would achieve and what Democratic politicians actually delivered. Although the Civil Rights Act of 1964 helped end apartheid conditions in the South, a crucial objective for which grassroots black Southern activists fought and died, the legislation did little to address the structures of racism that shaped black lives in cities such as Chicago, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia. This was an intentional consequence of how the bill's sponsors, largely liberals from the North, Midwest, and West, crafted the legislation.\n\nAs King understood, Democratic politicians acted more boldly on race issues in Alabama and Mississippi than in New York and Massachusetts. \"There is a pressing need for a liberalism in the North which is truly liberal, a liberalism that firmly believes in integration in its own community as well as in the Deep South,\" King told the New York Urban League in September 1960. As the Urban League's executive director Whitney Young put it a few years later, \"liberalism seems to be related to the distance people are from the problem.\"\n\nAfter the 1964 election, where Republican candidate Barry Goldwater described the Civil Rights Act as unconstitutional, black voters essentially found themselves in a one-party system for presidential elections. Republicans turned their attention to white voters in the South and suburbs and have made few serious attempts in subsequent campaigns to appeal to the African American electorate. Richard Nixon in 1960 is the last Republican candidate to earn more than 15 percent of black votes.\n\nThis is a problem for black voters, because the Democratic Party's vision of racial justice is also extremely limited. Northern liberals pioneered what scholars now call \"color-blind racism.\" That's when racially neutral language makes extreme racial inequalities appear to be the natural outcome of innocent private choices or free-market forces rather than intentional public policies such as housing covenants, federal mortgage redlining, public-housing segregation, and school zoning.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers drafted civil-rights legislation that would challenge Jim Crow laws in the South while leaving de facto segregation in the North intact. When NBC News asked the civil-rights organizer Bayard Rustin why many African American communities rioted the summer after the bill passed, he said, \"People have to understand that although the civil-rights bill was good and something for which I worked arduously, there was nothing in it that had any effect whatsoever on the three major problems Negroes face in the North: housing, jobs, and integrated schools ... The civil-rights bill, because of this failure, has caused an even deeper frustration in the North.\" Today's protest movements against second-class citizenship in Baltimore; Ferguson, Missouri; Oakland, California; and elsewhere are in part a legacy of the unresolved failures of civil-rights legislation.\n\nUnfortunately for black voters, most white politicians and voters assume that the civil-rights revolution not only leveled the playing field, but also tilted it in favor of African Americans. The white backlash to civil rights helped resurrect the Republican Party after the disastrous Goldwater campaign in 1964, and, over the last five decades, the Democratic Party has followed the electorate to the right.\n\nThis poses the biggest problem for black voters today, which is that Democrats running for state or national office aspire to win black votes without appearing to be beholden to black voters. This is especially true of the three Democratic presidents since Kennedy and Johnson. Black support was crucial to the elections of Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton (each received more than 80 percent of black votes), but both distanced themselves from policies that might seem to disproportionately help black people. Urban League Director Vernon Jordan outlined his concerns a year into Carter's presidency: \"We have no full employment policy. We have no welfare reform policy. We have no national health policy. We have no urban revitalization policy. We have no aggressive affirmative action policy. We have no solutions to the grinding problems of poverty and discrimination.\"\n\nWhen Bill Clinton and the \"New Democrats\" emerged victorious in the 1990s, thanks in large part to 83 percent support from black voters in 1992 and 84 percent in 1996, they adopted policies, such as welfare reform (the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996) and a crime bill (the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994) that proved ruinous for many black Americans. \"It is difficult to overstate the damage that's been done,\" the legal scholar Michelle Alexander noted recently of Clinton's presidency. \"Generations have been lost to the prison system; countless families have been torn apart or rendered homeless; and a school-to-prison pipeline has been born that shuttles young people from their decrepit, underfunded schools to brand-new high-tech prisons.\" Clinton acknowledged last year that the crime bill \"cast too wide a net\" and made the problem of mass incarceration worse.\n\nMore recently, as more groups-evangelicals, gays and lesbians, and gun owners, among them-lobby for specific policies, black voters have seen their interests deemed too \"special\" for consideration by a democratic administration. President Obama has felt the pressure to connect with black voters while distancing himself from black interests. Although his signature accomplishment, the Affordable Care Act, will surely benefit black Americans, he has been reluctant to endorse policies that cannot be pitched as universal. In a 2012 interview with Black Enterprise Magazine he said , \"I want all Americans to have opportunity. I'm not the president of black America. I'm the president of the United States of America.\"\n\nIn the 2016 Democratic primary, African Americans are challenging Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders to earn their votes. Whoever wins the nomination will likely garner support from more than 85 percent of black voters, but African Americans still lack a mechanism to hold Democrats accountable once they are elected. Consequently, the outlook for blacks in the United States regarding housing, jobs, education, and criminal justice is little better today than when Kennedy helped get King out of jail in 1960. During this election year, they will again weigh what they won and what they lost when they cast their lot with the Democratic Party."

      "text": "The Great Land Robbery\n\nThe shameful story of how 1 million black families have been ripped from their farms\n\nImages above: A sign on a utility pole to deter hunters, near the old Scott-family homestead, Drew, Mississippi; Willena's brother Isaac Daniel Scott Sr. amid soybeans in Mound Bayou.\n\nUpdated at 2:15 p.m. ET on September 29, 2019.\n\n\"You ever chop before?\" Willena Scott-White was testing me. I sat with her in the cab of a Chevy Silverado pickup truck, swatting at the squadrons of giant, fluttering mosquitoes that had invaded the interior the last time she opened a window. I was spending the day with her family as they worked their fields just outside Ruleville, in Mississippi's Leflore County. With her weathered brown hands, Scott-White gave me a pork sandwich wrapped in a grease-stained paper towel. I slapped my leg. Mosquitoes can bite through denim, it turns out.\n\nCotton sowed with planters must be chopped-thinned and weeded manually with hoes-to produce orderly rows of fluffy bolls. The work is backbreaking, and the people who do it maintain that no other job on Earth is quite as demanding. I had labored long hours over other crops, but had to admit to Scott-White, a 60-something grandmother who'd grown up chopping, that I'd never done it.\n\n\"Then you ain't never worked,\" she replied.\n\nThe fields alongside us as we drove were monotonous. With row crops, monotony is good. But as we toured 1,000 acres of land in Leflore and Bolivar Counties, straddling Route 61, Scott-White pointed out the demarcations between plots. A trio of steel silos here. A post there. A patch of scruffy wilderness in the distance. Each landmark was a reminder of the Scott legacy that she had fought to keep-or to regain-and she noted this with pride. Each one was also a reminder of an inheritance that had once been stolen.\n\nDrive Route 61 through the Mississippi Delta and you'll find much of the scenery exactly as it was 50 or 75 years ago. Imposing plantations and ramshackle shotgun houses still populate the countryside from Memphis to Vicksburg. Fields stretch to the horizon. The hands that dig into black Delta dirt belong to people like Willena Scott-White, African Americans who bear faces and names passed down from men and women who were owned here, who were kept here, and who chose to stay here, tending the same fields their forebears tended.\n\nBut some things have changed. Back in the day, snow-white bolls of King Cotton reigned. Now much of the land is green with soybeans. The farms and plantations are much larger-industrial operations with bioengineered plants, laser-guided tractors, and crop-dusting drones. Fewer and fewer farms are still owned by actual farmers. Investors in boardrooms throughout the country have bought hundreds of thousands of acres of premium Delta land. If you're one of the millions of people who have a retirement account with the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association, for instance, you might even own a little bit yourself.\n\nTIAA is one of the largest pension firms in the United States. Together with its subsidiaries and associated funds, it has a portfolio of more than 80,000 acres in Mississippi alone, most of them in the Delta. If the fertile crescent of Arkansas is included, TIAA holds more than 130,000 acres in a strip of counties along the Mississippi River. And TIAA is not the only big corporate landlord in the region. Hancock Agricultural Investment Group manages more than 65,000 acres in what it calls the \"Delta states.\" The real-estate trust Farmland Partners has 30,000 acres in and around the Delta. AgriVest, a subsidiary of the Swiss bank UBS, owned 22,000 acres as of 2011. (AgriVest did not respond to a request for more recent information.)\n\nUnlike their counterparts even two or three generations ago, black people living and working in the Delta today have been almost completely uprooted from the soil-as property owners, if not as laborers. In Washington County, Mississippi, where last February TIAA reportedly bought 50,000 acres for more than $200 million, black people make up 72 percent of the population but own only 11 percent of the farmland, in part or in full. In Tunica County, where TIAA has acquired plantations from some of the oldest farm-owning white families in the state, black people make up 77 percent of the population but own only 6 percent of the farmland. In Holmes County, the third-blackest county in the nation, black people make up about 80 percent of the population but own only 19 percent of the farmland. TIAA owns plantations there, too. In just a few years, a single company has accumulated a portfolio in the Delta almost equal to the remaining holdings of the African Americans who have lived on and shaped this land for centuries.\n\nThis is not a story about TIAA-at least not primarily. The company's newfound dominance in the region is merely the topsoil covering a history of loss and legally sanctioned theft in which TIAA played no part. But TIAA's position is instrumental in understanding both how the crimes of Jim Crow have been laundered by time and how the legacy of ill-gotten gains has become a structural part of American life. The land was wrested first from Native Americans, by force. It was then cleared, watered, and made productive for intensive agriculture by the labor of enslaved Africans, who after Emancipation would come to own a portion of it. Later, through a variety of means-sometimes legal, often coercive, in many cases legal and coercive, occasionally violent-farmland owned by black people came into the hands of white people. It was aggregated into larger holdings, then aggregated again, eventually attracting the interest of Wall Street.\n\nOwners of small farms everywhere, black and white alike, have long been buffeted by larger economic forces. But what happened to black landowners in the South, and particularly in the Delta, is distinct, and was propelled not only by economic change but also by white racism and local white power. A war waged by deed of title has dispossessed 98 percent of black agricultural landowners in America. They have lost 12 million acres over the past century. But even that statement falsely consigns the losses to long-ago history. In fact, the losses mostly occurred within living memory, from the 1950s onward. Today, except for a handful of farmers like the Scotts who have been able to keep or get back some land, black people in this most productive corner of the Deep South own almost nothing of the bounty under their feet.\n\nLand has always been the main battleground of racial conflict in Mississippi. During Reconstruction, fierce resistance from the planters who had dominated antebellum society effectively killed any promise of land or protection from the Freedmen's Bureau, forcing masses of black laborers back into de facto bondage. But the sheer size of the black population-black people were a majority in Mississippi until the 1930s-meant that thousands were able to secure tenuous footholds as landowners between Emancipation and the Great Depression.\n\nDriven by what W. E. B. Du Bois called \"land hunger\" among freedmen during Reconstruction, two generations of black workers squirreled away money and went after every available and affordable plot they could, no matter how marginal or hopeless. Some found sympathetic white landowners who would sell to them. Some squatted on unused land or acquired the few homesteads available to black people. Some followed visionary leaders to all-black utopian agrarian experiments, such as Mound Bayou, in Bolivar County.\n\nFrom March 1901: W. E. B. Du Bois's 'The Freedmen's Bureau'\n\nIt was never much, and it was never close to just, but by the early 20th century, black people had something to hold on to. In 1900, according to the historian James C. Cobb, black landowners in Tunica County outnumbered white ones three to one. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, there were 25,000 black farm operators in 1910, an increase of almost 20 percent from 1900. Black farmland in Mississippi totaled 2.2 million acres in 1910-some 14 percent of all black-owned agricultural land in the country, and the most of any state.\n\nThe foothold was never secure. From the beginning, even the most enterprising black landowners found themselves fighting a war of attrition, often fraught with legal obstacles that made passing title to future generations difficult. Bohlen Lucas, one of the few black Democratic politicians in the Delta during Reconstruction (most black politicians at the time were Republicans), was born enslaved and managed to buy a 200-acre farm from his former overseer, as the historian John C. Willis has documented in his 2000 book, Forgotten Time . But, like many farmers, who often have to borrow against expected harvests to pay for equipment, supplies, and the rent or mortgage on their land, Lucas depended on credit extended by powerful lenders. In his case, credit depended specifically on white patronage, given in exchange for his help voting out the Reconstruction government-after which his patrons abandoned him. He was left with 20 acres.\n\nIn Humphreys County, Lewis Spearman avoided the pitfalls of white patronage by buying less valuable wooded tracts and grazing cattle there as he moved into cotton. (Spearman's biographical details, too, appear in Forgotten Time .) But when cotton crashed in the 1880s, Spearman, over his head in debt, crashed with it. *\n\nAround the turn of the century, in Leflore County, a black farm organizer and proponent of self-sufficiency-referred to as a \"notoriously bad Negro\" in the local newspapers-led a black populist awakening, marching defiantly and by some accounts bringing boycotts against white merchants. White farmers responded with a posse that may have killed as many as 100 black farmers and sharecroppers along with women and children. The fate of the \"bad Negro\" in question, named Oliver Cromwell, is uncertain. Some sources say he escaped to Jackson, and into anonymity.\n\nLike so many of his forebears, Ed Scott Sr., Willena Scott-White's grandfather, acquired his land through not much more than force of will. As recorded in the thick binders of family history that Willena had brought along in the truck, and that we flipped through between stretches of work in the fields, his life had attained the gloss of folklore. He was born in 1886 in western Alabama, a generation removed from bondage. Spurred by that same land hunger, Scott took his young family to the Delta, seeking opportunities to farm his own property. He sharecropped and rented, and managed large farms for white planters, who valued his ability to run their sprawling estates. One of these men was Palmer H. Brooks, who owned a 7,000-acre plantation in Mississippi's Leflore and Sunflower Counties. Brooks was uncommonly progressive, encouraging entrepreneurship among the black laborers on his plantation, building schools and churches for them, and providing loans. Scott was ready when Brooks decided to sell plots to black laborers, and he bought his first 100 acres.\n\nUnlike Bohlen Lucas, Scott largely avoided politics. Unlike Lewis Spearman, he paid his debts and kept some close white allies-a necessity, since he usually rejected government assistance. And unlike Oliver Cromwell, he led his community under the rules already in place, appearing content with what he'd earned for his family in an environment of total segregation. He leveraged technical skills and a talent for management to impress sympathetic white people and disarm hostile ones. \"Granddaddy always had nice vehicles,\" Scott-White told me. They were a trapping of pride in a life of toil. As was true in most rural areas at the time, a new truck was not just a flashy sign of prosperity but also a sort of credit score. Wearing starched dress shirts served the same purpose, elevating Scott in certain respects-always within limits-even above some white farmers who drove into town in dirty overalls. The trucks got shinier as his holdings grew. By the time Scott died, in 1957, he had amassed more than 1,000 acres of farmland.\n\nScott-White guided me right up to the Quiver River, where the legend of her family began. It was a choked, green-brown gurgle of a thing, the kind of lazy waterway that one imagines to be brimming with fat, yawning catfish and snakes. \"Mr. Brooks sold all of the land on the east side of this river to black folks,\" Scott-White told me. She swept her arm to encompass the endless acres. \"All of these were once owned by black families.\"\n\nThat era of black ownership , in the Delta and throughout the country, was already fading by the time Scott died. As the historian Pete Daniel recounts, half a million black-owned farms across the country failed in the 25 years after 1950. Joe Brooks, the former president of the Emergency Land Fund, a group founded in 1972 to fight the problem of dispossession, has estimated that something on the order of 6 million acres was lost by black farmers from 1950 to 1969. That's an average of 820 acres a day-an area the size of New York's Central Park erased with each sunset. Black-owned cotton farms in the South almost completely disappeared, diminishing from 87,000 to just over 3,000 in the 1960s alone. According to the Census of Agriculture, the racial disparity in farm acreage increased in Mississippi from 1950 to 1964, when black farmers lost almost 800,000 acres of land. An analysis for The Atlantic by a research team that included Dania Francis, at the University of Massachusetts, and Darrick Hamilton, at Ohio State, translates this land loss into a financial loss-including both property and income-of $3.7 billion to $6.6 billion in today's dollars.\n\nJesmyn Ward: Racism is 'built into the very bones' of Mississippi\n\nThis was a silent and devastating catastrophe, one created and maintained by federal policy. President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal life raft for agriculture helped start the trend in 1937 with the establishment of the Farm Security Administration, an agency within the Department of Agriculture. Although the FSA ostensibly existed to help the country's small farmers, as happened with much of the rest of the New Deal, white administrators often ignored or targeted poor black people-denying them loans and giving sharecropping work to white people. After Roosevelt's death, in 1945, conservatives in Congress replaced the FSA with the Farmers Home Administration, or FmHA. The FmHA quickly transformed the FSA's programs for small farmers, establishing the sinews of the loan-and-subsidy structure that undergirds American agriculture today. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy's administration created the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, or ASCS, a complementary program to the FmHA that also provided loans to farmers. The ASCS was a federal effort-also within the Department of Agriculture-but, crucially, the members of committees doling out money and credit were elected locally, during a time when black people were prohibited from voting.\n\nThrough these programs, and through massive crop and surplus purchasing, the USDA became the safety net, price-setter, chief investor, and sole regulator for most of the farm economy in places like the Delta. The department could offer better loan terms to risky farmers than banks and other lenders, and mostly outcompeted private credit. In his book Dispossession , Daniel calls the setup \"agrigovernment.\" Land-grant universities pumped out both farm operators and the USDA agents who connected those operators to federal money. Large plantations ballooned into even larger industrial crop factories as small farms collapsed. The mega-farms held sway over agricultural policy, resulting in more money, at better interest rates, for the plantations themselves. At every level of agrigovernment, the leaders were white.\n\nMajor audits and investigations of the USDA have found that illegal pressures levied through its loan programs created massive transfers of wealth from black to white farmers, especially in the period just after the 1950s. In 1965, the United States Commission on Civil Rights uncovered blatant and dramatic racial differences in the level of federal investment in farmers. The commission found that in a sample of counties across the South, the FmHA provided much larger loans for small and medium-size white-owned farms, relative to net worth, than it did for similarly sized black-owned farms-evidence that racial discrimination \"has served to accelerate the displacement and impoverishment of the Negro farmer.\"\n\nCheck out more from this issue and find your next story to read.\n\nIn Sunflower County, a man named Ted Keenan told investigators that in 1956, local banks had denied him loans after a bad crop because of his position with the NAACP, where he openly advocated for voting rights. The FmHA had denied him loans as well. Keenan described how Eugene Fisackerly, the leader of the White Citizens' Council in Sunflower County, together with representatives of Senator James Eastland, a notorious white supremacist who maintained a large plantation there, had intimidated him into renouncing his affiliation with the NAACP and agreeing not to vote. Only then did Eastland's man call the local FmHA agent, prompting him to reconsider Keenan's loan.\n\nA landmark 2001 investigation by the Associated Press into extortion, exploitation, and theft directed against black farmers uncovered more than 100 cases like Keenan's. In the 1950s and '60s, Norman Weathersby, a Holmes County Chevrolet dealer who enjoyed a local monopoly on trucks and heavy farm equipment, required black farmers to put up land as collateral for loans on equipment. A close friend of his, William Strider, was the local FmHA agent. Black farmers in the area claimed that the two ran a racket: Strider would slow-walk them on FmHA loans, which meant they would then default on Weathersby's loans and lose their land to him. Strider and Weathersby were reportedly free to run this racket because black farmers were shut out by local banks.\n\nAnalyzing the history of federal programs, the Emergency Land Fund emphasizes a key distinction. While most of the black land loss appears on its face to have been through legal mechanisms-\"the tax sale; the partition sale; and the foreclosure\"-it mainly stemmed from illegal pressures, including discrimination in federal and state programs, swindles by lawyers and speculators, unlawful denials of private loans, and even outright acts of violence or intimidation. Discriminatory loan servicing and loan denial by white-controlled FmHA and ASCS committees forced black farmers into foreclosure, after which their property could be purchased by wealthy landowners, almost all of whom were white. Discrimination by private lenders had the same result. Many black farmers who escaped foreclosure were defrauded by white tax assessors who set assessments too high, leading to unaffordable tax obligations. The inevitable result: tax sales, where, again, the land was purchased by wealthy white people. Black people's lack of access to legal services complicated inheritances and put family claims to title in jeopardy. Lynchings, police brutality, and other forms of intimidation were sometimes used to dispossess black farmers, and even when land wasn't a motivation for such actions, much of the violence left land without an owner.\n\nIn interviews with researchers from the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History in 1985, Henry Woodard Sr., an African American who had bought land in the 1950s in Tunica County, said he had managed to keep up for years through a combination of his own industry, small loans from the FmHA and white banks, and the rental of additional land from other hard-pressed black landowners. Then, in 1966, the activist James Meredith-whose 1962 fight to integrate Ole Miss sparked deadly riots and a wave of white backlash-embarked on the famous March Against Fear . The next planting season, Woodard recalled, his white lenders ignored him. \"I sensed that it was because of this march,\" he said. \"And it was a lady told me-I was at the post office and she told me, she said, 'Henry, you Negroes, y'all want to live like white folks. Y'all don't know how white folks live. But y'all are gonna have to be on your own now.' \"\n\nWoodard's story would have been familiar to countless farmers in the Delta. In Holmes County, a crucible of the voting-rights movement, a black effort to integrate the local ASCS committees was so successful that it was subject to surveillance and sabotage by the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission, an official agency created by Governor J. P. Coleman in 1956 to resist integration. Black landowners involved in running for the committees or organizing for votes faced fierce retaliation. In 1965, The New Republic reported that in Issaquena County, just north of Vicksburg, the \"insurance of Negroes active in the ASCS elections had been canceled, loans were denied to Negroes on all crops but cotton, and ballots were not mailed to Negro wives who were co-owners of land.\" Even in the decades after the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, formal and informal complaints against the USDA poured out of the Delta.\n\nThese cases of dispossession can only be called theft. While the civil-rights era is remembered as a time of victories against disenfranchisement and segregation, many realities never changed. The engine of white wealth built on kleptocracy-which powered both Jim Crow and its slave-state precursor-continued to run. The black population in Mississippi declined by almost one-fifth from 1950 to 1970, as the white population increased by the exact same percentage. Farmers slipped away one by one into the night, appearing later as laborers in Chicago and Detroit. By the time black people truly gained the ballot in Mississippi, they were a clear minority, held in thrall to a white conservative supermajority.\n\nNikole Hannah-Jones: Freedom Summer, 1964: Did it really change Mississippi?\n\nMass dispossession did not require a central organizing force or a grand conspiracy. Thousands of individual decisions by white people, enabled or motivated by greed, racism, existing laws, and market forces, all pushed in a single direction. But some white people undeniably would have organized it this way if they could have. The civil-rights leader Bayard Rustin reported in 1956 that documents taken from the office of Robert Patterson, one of the founding fathers of the White Citizens' Councils, proposed a \"master plan\" to force hundreds of thousands of black people from Mississippi in order to reduce their potential voting power. Patterson envisioned, in Rustin's words, \"the decline of the small independent farmer\" and ample doses of \"economic pressure.\"\n\nAn upheaval of this scale and speed-the destruction of black farming, an occupation that had defined the African American experience-might in any other context be described as a revolution, or seen as a historical fulcrum. But it came and went with little remark.\n\nWorld War II transformed America in many ways. It certainly transformed a generation of southern black men. That generation included Medgar Evers, a future civil-rights martyr, assassinated while leading the Mississippi NAACP; he served in a segregated transportation company in Europe during the war. It included Willena's father, Ed Scott Jr., who also served in a segregated transportation company. These men were less patient, more defiant, and in many ways more reckless than their fathers and grandfathers had been. They chafed under a system that forced them to relearn how to bow and scrape, as if the war had never happened. In the younger Scott's case, wartime service sharpened his inherited land hunger, pushing him to seek more land and greater financial independence, both for himself and for his community. One of his siblings told his biographer, Julian Rankin, that the family's deepest conviction was that \"a million years from now ... this land will still be Scotts' land.\"\n\nUpon his return to the Delta, Scott continued down his father's hard path, avoiding any interface with the FmHA and the public portions of the agrigovernment system, which by that time had spread its tendrils throughout Sunflower and Leflore Counties. He leaned on the friendships he and his father had made with local business owners and farmers, and secured credit for growing his holdings from friendly white bankers. Influenced by the civil-rights movement and its emphasis on community solidarity and activism, Scott borrowed from Oliver Cromwell's self-sufficiency playbook too. He used his status to provide opportunities for other black farmers and laborers. \"Daddy said that everyone who worked for us would always be able to eat,\" Willena Scott-White told me. He made sure of more than that. Scott sent relatives' and tenants' children to school, paid for books, helped people open bank accounts and buy their own land. When civil-rights activists made their way down for Mississippi's Freedom Summer, in 1964, he packed up meals and brought them to rallies.\n\nWhen Scott-White thinks of her father, who died in 2015, she seems to become a young girl again. With allowances for nostalgia, she recalls a certain kind of country poorness-but-not-poverty, whereby children ran barefoot and worked from the moment they could walk, but ate well, lived in houses with solid floors and tight roofs, and went to high school and college if they showed skill. \"We lived in something like a utopia,\" Scott-White told me. But things changed at the tail end of the 1970s. Plummeting commodity prices forced highly leveraged farmers to seek loans wherever they could find them. Combined with the accelerating inflation of that decade, the beginnings of the farm-credit crisis made farming at scale without federal assistance impossible. Yet federal help-even then, two decades after the Civil Rights Act-was not available for most black farmers. According to a 2005 article in The Nation , \"In 1984 and 1985, at the height of the farm crisis, the USDA lent a total of $1.3 billion to nearly 16,000 farmers to help them maintain their land. Only 209 of those farmers were black.\"\n\nAs Rankin tells it in his biography, Catfish Dream , Scott made his first visit to an FmHA office in 1978. With the assistance of Vance Nimrod, a white man who worked with the black-owned Delta Foundation, a nonprofit promoting economic advancement for black Mississippians, Scott secured an operating loan for a season of soybeans and rice from the FmHA agent Delbert Edwards. The first time was easy-although, crucially, Nimrod accompanied him to the Leflore County office, in Greenwood. When Scott returned the next year without Nimrod, driving a shiny new truck the way his father used to, Edwards asked where Nimrod was. According to Rankin, Scott told the agent that Nimrod had only come to help secure that first loan; he wasn't a business partner. When Edwards saw Scott's vehicle, he seemed perplexed. \"Who told you to buy a new truck?\" he asked. Edwards ended up denying the requested loan amount.\n\nAt the same time, Edwards and the FmHA were moving to help local white farmers weather the storm, often by advising them to get into raising catfish. Commercial catfish farming was a relatively new industry, and it had found a home in the Delta as prices for row crops crashed and new legislation gave the USDA power and incentive to build up domestic fish farming. FmHA agents pushed white farmers to convert wide fields on the floodplain into giant catfish ponds, many of which would become contract-growing hubs for Delta Pride Catfish, a cooperative that quickly evolved into a local monopoly. The federal government poured millions of dollars into the catfish boom by way of FmHA loans, many of which were seized on by the largest white landowners, and kept those white landowners solvent. Mississippi became the catfish capital of the world in the 1970s. But the FmHA did not reach out to Scott, nor is there evidence that it supported the ambitions of any black farmers who might have wanted to get into catfish.\n\nScott decided to get into catfish anyway, digging eight ponds in fields where rice had grown the season before. He found his own catfish stocks and learned the ins and outs of the industry pretty much on his own. Scott finished digging his ponds in 1981, at which point, according to Rankin, Edwards of the FmHA visited the property and told him point-blank: \"Don't think I'm giving you any damn money for that dirt you're moving.\" The Mississippi FmHA would eventually compel Edwards to provide loans for Scott's catfish operation for 1981 and 1982. But as court records show, the amount approved was far less than what white catfish farmers usually got-white farmers sometimes received double or triple the amount per acre that Scott did-and enough to stock only four of the eight ponds. (Edwards could not be reached for comment on any of the episodes recounted here.)\n\nScott's Fresh Catfish opened in 1983. As a marker outside the old processing shed now indicates, it was the first catfish plant in the country owned by an African American. But discrimination doomed the enterprise before it really began. Without enough capital, Scott was never able to raise fish at the volume he needed. He claimed in court and later to Rankin that he had also been denied a chance to purchase stock in Delta Pride-a requirement to become a contract grower-because he was black. Without access to a cooperative, he had to do the processing and packaging himself, adding to the cost of his product. In 2006, Delta Pride and Country Select Catfish were combined into a new business entity, Consolidated Catfish Producers. When reached for comment, a spokesperson for Consolidated Catfish said that no employee at the new company could \"definitively answer\" questions about Scott or alleged discrimination against him.\n\nScott was in his 60s by the time his plant got off the ground. The effort took a toll. He slowly went blind. Arthritis claimed his joints. His heart began to fail. The plant limped quietly through the '80s and then shut down. Lenders began the process of foreclosing on some of Scott's cropland as early as 1983. In 1995, the FmHA approved a request from Scott to lease most of his remaining acres. The USDA itself had claimed most of his land by the late 1980s.\n\nThe downfall of the Scott catfish enterprise was proof of the strength and endurance of what the federal government would later state could be seen as a federally funded \"conspiracy to force minority and disadvantaged farmers off their land through discriminatory loan practices.\" The Scotts were not small-timers. They had the kind of work ethic and country savvy that are usually respected around the Delta. When the powers that be finally prevailed over Ed Scott Jr., they had completed something decisive, something that even today feels as if it cannot be undone.\n\nBut land is never really lost, not in America. Twelve million acres of farmland in a country that has become a global breadbasket carries immense value, and the dispossessed land in the Delta is some of the most productive in America. The soil on the alluvial plain is rich. The region is warm and wet. Much of the land is perfect for industrialized agriculture.\n\nSome white landowners, like Norman Weathersby, themselves the beneficiaries of government-funded dispossession, left land to their children. Some sold off to their peers, and others saw their land gobbled up by even larger white-owned farms. Nowadays, as fewer and fewer of the children of aging white landowners want to continue farming, more land has wound up in the hands of trusts and investors. Over the past 20 years, the real power brokers in the Delta are less likely to be good ol' boys and more likely to be suited venture capitalists, hedge-fund managers, and agribusiness consultants who run farms with the cold precision of giant circuit boards.\n\nOne new addition to the mix is pension funds. Previously, farmland had never been a choice asset class for large-scale investing. In 1981, what was then called the General Accounting Office (now the Government Accountability Office) released a report exploring a proposal by a firm seeking pension-investment opportunities in farmland. The report essentially laughed off the prospect. The authors found that only about one dollar of every $4,429 in retirement funds was invested in farmland.\n\nBut commodity prices increased, and land values rose. In 2008, a weakened dollar forced major funds to broaden their search for hedges against inflation. \"The market in agricultural land in the U.S. is currently experiencing a boom,\" an industry analyst, Tom Vulcan, wrote that year. He took note of the recent entry of TIAA-CREF, which had \"spent some $340 million on farmland across seven states.\" TIAA, as the company is now called, would soon become the biggest pension-fund player in the agricultural real-estate game across the globe. In 2010, TIAA bought a controlling interest in Westchester Group, a major agricultural-asset manager. In 2014, it bought Nuveen, another large asset-management firm. In 2015, with Nuveen directing its overall investment strategy and Westchester and other smaller subsidiaries operating as purchasers and managers, TIAA raised $3 billion for a new global farmland-investment partnership. By the close of 2016, Nuveen's management portfolio included nearly 2 million acres of farmland, worth close to $6 billion.\n\nInvestment in farmland has proved troublesome for TIAA in Mississippi and elsewhere. TIAA is a pension company originally set up for teachers and professors and people in the nonprofit world. It has cultivated a reputation for social responsibility: promoting environmental sustainability and respecting land rights, labor rights, and resource rights. TIAA has endorsed the United Nations-affiliated Principles for Responsible Investment, which include special provisions for investment in farmland, including specific guidelines with regard to sustainability, leasing practices, and establishing the provenance of tracts of land.\n\nThe company has faced pushback for its move into agriculture. In 2015, the international nonprofit Grain , which advocates for local control of farmland by small farmers, released the results of an investigation accusing TIAA's farmland-investment arm of skirting laws limiting foreign land acquisition in its purchase of more than half a million acres in Brazil. The report found that TIAA had violated multiple UN guidelines in creating a joint venture with a Brazilian firm to invest in farmland without transparency. The Grain report alleges that when Brazil tightened laws designed to restrict foreign investment, TIAA purchased 49 percent of a Brazilian company that then acted as its proxy. According to The New York Times , TIAA and its subsidiaries also appear to have acquired land titles from Euclides de Carli, a businessman often described in Brazil as a big-time grileiro -a member of a class of landlords and land grabbers who use a mix of legitimate means, fraud, and violence to force small farmers off their land. In response to criticism of TIAA's Brazil portfolio, Jose Minaya, then the head of private-markets asset management at TIAA, told WNYC's The Takeaway : \"We believe and know that we are in compliance with the law, and we are transparent about what we do in Brazil. From a title perspective, our standards are very focused around not displacing individuals or indigenous people, respecting land rights as well as human rights ... In every property that we have acquired, we don't just do due diligence on that property. We do due diligence on the sellers, whether it's an individual or whether it's an entity.\"\n\nTIAA's land dealings have faced scrutiny in the United States as well. In 2012, the National Family Farm Coalition found that the entry into agriculture of deep-pocketed institutional investors-TIAA being an example-had made it pretty much impossible for smaller farmers to compete. Institutional investment has removed millions of acres from farmers' hands, more or less permanently. \"Pension funds not only have the power to outbid smaller, local farmers, they also have the long-term goal of retaining farmland for generations,\" the report noted.\n\nAsked about TIAA's record, a spokesperson for Nuveen maintained that the company has built its Delta portfolio following ethical-investment guidelines : \"We have a long history of investing responsibly in farmland, in keeping with our corporate values and the UN-backed Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). As a long-term owner, we bring capital, professional expertise, and sustainable farming practices to each farm we own, and we are always looking to partner with expansion-minded tenants who will embrace that approach and act as good stewards of the land.\" The company did not comment on the history of any individual tract in its Delta portfolio.\n\nBut even assuming that every acre under management by big corporate interests in the Delta has been acquired by way of ethical-investment principles, the nature of the mid-century dispossession and its multiple layers of legitimation raise the question of whether responsible investment in farmland there is even possible. As a people and a class, black farmers were plainly targets, but the deed histories of tax sales and foreclosures don't reveal whether individual debtors were moved off the land because of discrimination and its legal tools.\n\nIn addition, land records are spotty in rural areas, especially records from the 1950s and '60s, and in some cases it's unclear exactly which records the investors used to meet internal requirements. According to Tristan Quinn-Thibodeau, a campaigner and organizer at ActionAid, an anti-poverty and food-justice nonprofit, \"It's been a struggle to get this information.\" The organization has tried to follow the trails of deeds and has asked TIAA-which manages ActionAid's own pension plan-for an analysis of the provenance of its Delta portfolio. Such an analysis has not been provided.\n\nWhat we do know is that, whatever the specific lineage of each acre, Wall Street investors have found a lucrative new asset class whose origins lie in part in mass dispossession. We know that the vast majority of black farmland in the country is no longer in black hands, and that black farmers have suffered far more hardships than white farmers have. The historian Debra A. Reid points out that \"between 1920 and 1997, the number of African Americans who farmed decreased by 98 percent, while white Americans who farmed declined by 66 percent.\" Referring to the cases studied in their 2001 investigation, Dolores Barclay and Todd Lewan of the Associated Press observed that virtually all of the property lost by black farmers \"is owned by whites or corporations.\" The foundation of these portfolios was a system of plantations whose owners created the agrigovernment system and absorbed thousands of small black-owned farms into ever larger white-owned farms. America has its own grileiros , and they stand on land that was once someone else's.\n\nAs we drove through the patchwork remnants of the Scotts' land, Willena Scott-White took me to the site of Scott's Fresh Catfish. Gleaming steel silos had turned into rusting hulks. The ponds were thick with weeds and debris. The exterior walls of the plant itself had collapsed. Rusted beams lay atop ruined machinery. Fire ants and kudzu had begun nature's reclamation.\n\nLate in Ed Scott Jr.'s life, as he slipped into Alzheimer's, Willena and his lawyer, Phil Fraas, fought to keep his original hopes alive. In the Pigford v. Glickman lawsuit of 1997, thousands of black farmers and their families won settlements against the USDA for discrimination that had occurred between 1981 and the end of 1996; the outlays ultimately reached a total of $2 billion. The Scotts were one of those families, and after a long battle to prove their case-with the assistance of Scott-White's meticulous notes and family history-in 2012 the family was awarded more than $6 million in economic damages, plus almost $400,000 in other damages and debt forgiveness. The court also helped the Scotts reclaim land possessed by the department. In a 1999 ruling, Judge Paul L. Friedman of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia acknowledged that forcing the federal government to compensate black farmers would \"not undo all that has been done\" in centuries of government-sponsored racism. But for the Scotts, it was a start.\n\n\"The telling factor, looking at it from the long view, is that at the time of World War I there were 1 million black farmers, and in 1992 there were 18,000,\" Fraas told me. The settlements stemming from Pigford cover only specific recent claims of discrimination, and none stretching back to the period of the civil-rights era, when the great bulk of black-owned farms disappeared. Most people have not pushed for any kind of deeper excavation.\n\nAny such excavation would quickly make plain the consequences of what occurred. During my drive with Scott-White, we traveled through parts of Leflore, Sunflower, and Washington Counties, three of the counties singled out by Opportunity Insights, a Harvard University research group, as among the worst in the country in terms of a child's prospects for upward mobility. Ten counties in the Delta are among the poorest 50 in America. According to new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on all 74,000 U.S. census tracts, four tracts in the Delta are among the lowest 100 when it comes to average life expectancy. More than 30 tracts in the Delta have an average life expectancy below 70. (The national average is 79.) In some Delta counties, the infant mortality rate is more than double the nationwide rate. As if to add gratuitous insult to injury, a new analysis from ProPublica finds that, as a result of the Internal Revenue Service's intense scrutiny of low-income taxpayers, the Delta is audited by the IRS more heavily than any other place in the country . In sum, the areas of deepest poverty and under the darkest shadow of death are the ones where dispossession was the most far-reaching.\n\nThe consequences of dispossession had long been predicted. Fannie Lou Hamer, a Sunflower County activist whose 1964 speech to a Democratic National Convention committee galvanized support for the Voting Rights Act, spoke often of the need for land reform as a precondition for true freedom. Hamer's utopian Freedom Farm experiment stressed cooperative landownership, and she said the concentration of land in the hands of a few landowners was \"at the base of our struggle for survival.\" In her analysis, mass dispossession should be seen as mass extraction. Even as the U.S. government invested billions in white farmers, it continued to extract wealth from black farmers in the Delta. Each black farmer who left the region, from Reconstruction onward, represented a tiny withdrawal from one side of a cosmic balance sheet and a deposit on the other side. This dynamic would only continue, in other ways and other places, as the Great Migration brought black families to northern cities.\n\nThis cosmic balance sheet underpins the national conversation-ever more robust-about reparations for black Americans. In that conversation, given momentum in part by the publication of Ta-Nehisi Coates's \"The Case for Reparations\" in this magazine in 2014, I hear echoes of Mississippi. I hear echoes of Hamer, the Scotts, Henry Woodard Sr., and others who petitioned the federal government to hold itself accountable for a history of extraction that has extended well beyond enslavement. But that conversation too easily becomes technical. How do we quantify discrimination? How do we define who was discriminated against? How do we repay those people according to what has been defined and quantified? The idea of reparations sometimes seems like a problem of economic rightsizing-something for the quants and wonks to work out.\n\nEconomics is, of course, a major consideration. According to the researchers Francis and Hamilton, \"The dispossession of black agricultural land resulted in the loss of hundreds of billions of dollars of black wealth. We must emphasize this estimate is conservative ... Depending on multiplier effects, rates of returns, and other factors, it could reach into the trillions.\" The large wealth gap between white and black families today exists in part because of this historic loss.\n\nBut money does not define every dimension of land theft. Were it not for dispossession, Mississippi today might well be a majority-black state, with a radically different political destiny. Imagine the difference in our national politics if the center of gravity of black electoral strength had remained in the South after the Voting Rights Act was passed.\n\nPolitics aside, how can reparations truly address the lives ruined, the family histories lost, the connection to the land severed? In America, land has always had a significance that exceeds its economic value. For a people who were once chattel themselves, real property has carried an almost mystical import. There's a reason the fabled promise that spread among freedmen after the Civil War was not a check, a job, or a refundable tax credit, but 40 acres of farmland to call home. The history of the Delta suggests that any conversation about reparations might need to be more qualitative and intangible than it is. And it must consider the land.\n\nLand hunger is ineffable, an indescribable yearning, and yet it is something that Americans, perhaps uniquely, feel and understand. That yearning tugged at me hardest as Willena Scott-White rounded out her tour of the fields, the afternoon slipping away. Out among the Scotts' fields is a clearing with a lone, tall tree. In the clearing is a small cemetery. A handful of crooked, weathered tombstones stand sentinel. This is where Ed Scott Jr. is buried, and where some of Willena's older siblings now rest. Willena posed for a picture beside her parents' grave. She told me that this is where her own bones will rest after her work on Earth is done.\n\n\"This is our land,\" she said.\n\nThis article appears in the September 2019 print edition with the headline \"This Land Was Our Land.\"\n\n* This article has been updated to reflect that the historian John C. Willis documented the biographies of Bohlen Lucas and Lewis Spearman in his book Forgotten Time."

While waiting in the coalition's lobby for an interview, a copy of a popular Time Magazine cover caught my eye. WE ARE AMERICANS , the cover read. The photo on the cover featured faces of various brown and yellow immigrants, eager and hopeful, representing both the spirit of America's revolutionary history and its inevitable future. I was remembering my own family's immigration when I stopped to wonder: Where are the Africans?\n\nU.S. immigration debates are overwhelmingly centered on immigrants from Latin America. Proportionately, Mexicans and central Americans far outnumber other immigrant groups in the United States. According to a Migration Policy Institute study, since 1970, \"a period during which the overall U.S. immigration population increased four-fold, the Mexican and central American population increased by a factor of 20.\" In a subsequent study on black immigration, the same organization reported that black African immigrants account for 3 percent of the total U.S. foreign-born population.\n\nLike their Latin American counterparts, African immigrants keep a low profile in an effort to avoid humiliation, deportation, and loss of work. Many of them, whether accidentally or otherwise, wind up blending in with African-American culture. But however closely they may identify with black America, they, too, are immigrants.\n\nTHE IRISH\n\nI recently read a book titled How The Irish Became White by Noel Ignatiev. Ignatiev traces this nation's white solidarity to the arrival of Irish settlers in New York in 1840, the country's subsequent disassociation from its African-American working class-and ultimately, from the African-American race.\n\nAccording to Ignatiev, Irish Catholics, then known as the blacks of Europe, came to America as a disenfranchised, oppressed race under the English Penal Laws. The greatest voice for Catholic emancipation at the time, Daniel O'Connell, urged the new immigrants to continue the struggle for equality in America by showing support for abolitionists. Instead, the Irish realized that discrimination against them by white elites was linked at least in part to their working, sleeping, and living closely alongside blacks of similar economic and social status.\n\nIn order to stand out from blacks economically, Irish immigrants had to monopolize their low-wage jobs and keep free Northern blacks from joining unions during the labor movement. And in order to disassociate socially, they had to consent to active participation in the oppression of the black race, embracing whiteness and the system that disenfranchised and justified an ungovernable hatred toward African-Americans.\n\nIgnatiev includes an 1843 letter from Daniel O'Connell: \"Over the broad Atlantic I pour forth my voice, saying, come out of such land, you Irishmen; or, if you remain, and dare countenance the system of slavery that is supported there, we will recognize you as Irishmen no longer.\"\n\nThe color of their skin saved them, but has also nearly obliterated a once-vibrant cultural identity so that today I know no Irishmen. I have friends of Irish descent, former co-workers who mentioned the occasional Irish grandfather, or associates who gesture toward familiarity of the lost heritage over empty pints on St. Patrick's Day-but the Irishmen are now white, and the Irishmen are now gone.\n\nRace in America is often thought of as a two-toned, immutable palette. No matter how early their ancestors arrived, Americans of Asian descent, Americans from Spanish-speaking countries, and Americans from the Middle East will always be considered foreign, it sometimes seems. For black immigrants who arrive as neither African-American nor white, affiliating with the African-American identity is often easier. Being considered African-American in this country is still better in most instances than being considered an immigrant.\n\nMuch as Irish immigrants benefited from the white racial umbrella, black immigrants are benefiting from a black racial umbrella. They cleave to African-American culture and identity groups and remain silent or unheard in the larger immigration dialogue. In the context of the immigration debate, while many of the prominent faces of those in need are often brown, it's worth remembering that the term immigrant captures black Africans, too. At the same time, black immigrants and their children are also helping to redefine what it means to be black in this country.\n\nON BEING BLACK\n\nWhen I was stopped in Arizona at a checkpoint during a midnight drive from Los Angeles to Houston, I was not asked if I was born in this country or if I was of legal status. The officer glanced at my license and simply asked me where I was going.\n\n\"Home,\" I answered. \"Back to Houston.\"\n\nI sounded like him and looked like about 14 percent of this country-so the officer let me pass. Someone like Natalie Portman-a white woman, but born in Jerusalem and an immigrant to the United States-might have had the same experience.\n\nIf Jose Antonio Vargas, the Pulitzer-winning journalist whose (brown) picture on the cover of Time hung on the wall of the New York Immigration Coalition, were stopped that night, he may have been interrogated with questions, squeezed for identification, for proof that he deserved to be here. How just is that?\n\nMy family left Liberia in 1990 amid the country's first civil war. We were among tens of thousands that successfully escaped to America. Five years old at the time, a green and frightened young immigrant, I moved with my growing family to three different states before settling in Houston in 1994. By then, my accent was gone. I pronounced the r 's at the ends of my words, I knew the radio music my elementary peers sang along to and I could quote the latest episodes of TGIF . By 2000, my only reference to Liberia, other than my parents, annual family reunions, and a war scar underneath my right foot was my name. I said it and people asked if I was African. If I did not say it, they could not know. We were the only African family in our small Texan town and as far as the residents were concerned-we were black. It was not until I moved to New York for college that my answer of \"Spring, Texas\" when people asked me where I was from was unacceptable. \"No,\" they would say, \"where are you from from?\" Oh. Liberia.\n\nLike a small percentage of Liberians, my recent ancestors were descendants of American slaves. A reverend by the name of June Moore immigrated to Liberia with his wife Adeline Moore in 1871. After settling in Arthington, Liberia, Wallace Moore, one of June's and Adeline's three sons, had a son named David Moore, who had a son named Herbert Moore, who had a son named Augustus Moore Sr.-my father.\n\nBut growing up in America as a black or white person encourages the abandonment of such history and the adoption of \"black\" or \"white\" American culture as one's own. Despite my Liberian heritage, my interactions outside of my house during my developmental years took place as though I were, culturally, an African-American-not an African. From first grade through high school, I received an American public-school education in which all mentions of people who looked like me were African-American. I took ownership of the culture because otherwise, I did not exist.\n\nWhen I was 11 years old, I was called a nigger at a neighborhood corner store by a shopkeeper who thought my friends and I were stealing from him when six or so of us entered his store after track practice. The word was foreign to me, as was his motivation in using it. My friends and I cried as we were chased out of the store, but even then I knew their tears came from a different, more familiar place.\n\nIn the same way we respond to someone with white skin-whether that person is a white European or a white Hispanic-so America responds to people with black skin, no matter if they have been here for 20 years or 200 years. Being black in America is accompanied by a stupefying consciousness, a sudden, lifelong awareness of your skin, your nose, your hair-all those things that, ironically, we are taught do not matter at all.\n\nPASSING\n\nStill, developing an awareness of all that being black in this country may entail does not automatically mean that young black immigrants are accepted by their peers. The young immigrant is usually subject to other kinds of bullying. National Geographic programming, comedians, and international news all showcase Africans as savage, disease-ridden, ignorant, and poor. As a young student in this country, an African student, there are few greater burdens than psychologically balancing the public's perception of Africa against what the immigrant knows to be true.\n\nSocial pressures cause a grave, hopeless desire to blend in with peers, even if the price is total rejection of the foods, music, and languages of that child's home country. The easiest avenue for assimilation into American culture, for young black immigrants, is the assimilation into African-American culture. African immigrants are not the only group to do this-Carribeans and black Hispanics may do this as well, all to ease the burdens of cultural ostracism.\n\nThese young people eventually learn to socially navigate both African-American and their home culture. This passing of black immigrants and first-generation black Americans as members of African-American culture results in a cross-cultural black identity, where the individual is equally invested in both African-American interests and the empowerment of their (or their parents') home country and the many issues that affect its native sons.\n\nMy father is a proud man. All of my uncles are proud men. They wear Liberia and her stories on their shoulders and made consistent attempts when I was growing up to engage us in her music and history. Still, my father was as careful as he was proud. My siblings and I were reminded to always obey the law, never get in trouble, to fear punishment and respect authority. The immigration struggles that face many Hispanics in this country-fear of prison, fear of deportation or separation from family-are more intensified among Africans, because many of us, my family included, left countries in conflict or at war. Drawing attention to your immigrant status means raising the possibility of having to return to a country whose economy and infrastructure may barely function.\n\nOurs is also a numbers game. As 3 percent of a foreign-born population, African influence in the immigration movement is low. Language barriers keep some black immigrants from becoming activists. It's not just about English; at one information session in the Bronx, instructions and information on legal clinic appointments were given only in Spanish, even though 10 percent of the attendants were black immigrants who mostly spoke French. The Francophones had to consult with one another to figure out what the session leader was saying.\n\nSome black immigrants are vocal and have received help from a few quarters. To people of countries beset by armed conflict, natural disaster, or other circumstances that would make going home unsafe, the United States grants what's called Temporary Protected Status (TPS). TPS gives certain foreign nationals a special opportunity to live in America, to work, to pay taxes, and to own homes and businesses. Haitians benefited from this after the 2010 earthquake, and Liberians were also beneficiaries.\n\nBut in 2007, an estimated 4,000 Liberians were told that their special status would expire on September 30 at midnight. On September 12, however, President George W. Bush signed a bill that gave the Liberians permission to stay another 18 months and continue working. That reprieve has since been granted four times; yet every year these Liberians-some with children who are American citizens, homeowners, and taxpayers-face the threat of deportation.\n\nLiberian nationals, with the help of the Universal Human Rights International Group and community associations led and managed by fellow Liberian immigrants, continue to lobby Congress for permanent residency. Michael Capuano, a Democratic U.S. congressman from Massachusetts, is a co-sponsor of the Liberian Refugee Immigration Protection Act. If passed, the bipartisan bill will allow Liberians with TPS to apply for permanent residency, something they are not currently allowed to do.\n\nYou may have passed a Liberian covered by TPS today. You may have thought that he was just black.\n\nWhat the Irish were to white identity in the 19th century, so are African immigrants to African-American identity today. Black immigrants have a meaningful contribution to make to the immigration debate; for Jose Antonio Vargas and the other brown faces on that Time cover, the black immigrant voice may be all the push reformists need."

      "text": "The Increasing Irrelevance of the Congressional Black Caucus\n\nThe group has failed to connect with young voters, which is not a good sign for its future.\n\nOn January 25, 1972, Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman elected to the United States Congress, announced her candidacy for president in a stump speech that sounded very much like those of today's presidential candidates. She told the Brooklyn crowd, \"I am not the candidate of any political bosses or fat cats or special interests. I stand here now without endorsements from many big name politicians or celebrities or any other kind of prop.\" She also stood there without the support of the Congressional Black Caucus, which she helped found the previous year. The reason? Some of the CBC's members thought Chisholm's focus on gender and outreach to other groups subverted the caucus's mission and explicit focus on race.\n\nFour decades later, Representative Donna Edwards sought to become the first black senator from Maryland and only the second black woman ever elected to the body. Like Chisholm, she also did not enjoy the explicit support of the CBC. Edwards confronted CBC members, and they cited her \"difficult nature\" and failure to establish good relationships as reasons for not endorsing her. On Tuesday, Edwards lost her bid for the Senate seat in a close primary race that may have turned out differently if she'd received the endorsement from more members of the nation's most powerful body of black legislators.\n\nAmong young African Americans, there is a growing sense that there are significant generational differences with the CBC and that the organization may have lost its conscience . Hillary Clinton has taken heat for the 1994 crime bill that led to the disproportionate incarceration of black people, but the bill was only assured passage once the CBC withdrew its opposition. CBC members have clashed with Black Lives Matter protesters. And activists have criticized the CBC Political Action Committee, a separate but associated group, for the board's ties to private prisons and big tobacco.\n\nWhile some of these criticisms are valid, there is little question that the CBC is of immense value to African Americans and the nation at large. For decades, it's been the organ through which the concerns of black Americans have entered the halls of Congress and the means by which policy victories have been delivered for disenfranchised minority communities. There is simply no doubting that the interests of black America remain central to the caucus's aims. But there is also little doubt that the black electorate is changing, and the CBC will have to keep pace with this evolution if it wants to remain relevant to black Americans.\n\nThe Congressional Black Caucus was formed as a nonpartisan body in early 1971 to rally the collective influence of its 13 members and ensure that issues facing African Americans were raised and debated in Congress. Its guiding principle, set forth by Representative Bill Clay of Missouri, was direct and concise: \"Black people have no permanent friends, no permanent enemies ... just permanent interests.\"\n\nIt didn't take long for the group to make national headlines. When President Nixon refused to meet with black legislators, they boycotted the State of the Union. The caucus declared that Nixon's unwillingness to meet with black members of Congress was emblematic of his disinterest in the concerns of African Americans. Shortly thereafter, the president conceded to a meeting, and the CBC received extensive media attention for its victory.\n\nProtest is very much a part of the CBC's character-many of today's CBC members are contemporaries of the civil-rights movement. It would seem that today's protest movements would be fertile ground for CBC goals. But many of today's black activists are not as interested in what they see as respectability politics or dressing in their Sunday best for protests like their civil-rights-era predecessors. They are taking the stage whenever they choose and demanding that presidential candidates hear them. They are challenging leaders from previous generations, and some of those leaders don't necessarily like it . In the black community, where eldership is revered, the boldness of today's protesters has rubbed some CBC members the wrong way. Many black activists don't care; they are less concerned with paying homage to elected officials and more interested in expedient policy outcomes.\n\nIf the CBC is to remain the voice of black America, it must find a way to incorporate these new leaders into its work and do a better job of hearing and addressing the concerns of young black Americans, including and especially Black Lives Matter protesters. This should not be difficult; the organization has successfully employed this strategy in the past. In the latter part of the 1970s into the late '80s, the CBC helped orchestrate the Free South Africa Movement protests. The movement included sit-ins and student protests, and was even featured on popular television shows such as A Different World . The group combined these popular efforts with a successful legislative strategy, leading the passage of sanctions on South Africa and defeating President Reagan's ensuing veto. This is the power and value of the caucus.\n\nBut political circumstances have changed. African Americans are still an electoral monolith, tending to vote in predictable ways that are similar to others in their demographic group. But they are also increasingly politically diverse. This is a function of expanding intra-racial inequality and a wider variety of lived experiences among blacks, including disparate health outcomes and susceptibility to violent crime . But the CBC can be resistant to the changing politics, lives, and preferences of black America. The caucus has high incumbency rates , and it's part of an institution where seniority is a qualification all its own. It is also closely tied to party priorities-it has effectively become the most reliably Democratic entity in Congress.\n\nThis stifles debate about policy options. Studies show substantive and significant differences emerging between economic classes of blacks on issues like government spending on crime-reduction and anti-poverty programs. As a group, African Americans consistently rate education as a top concern, but have varying opinions on how to secure solid schooling for black children-whether through increased investments in the public-school system or more school-choice options for black parents, including private-school scholarships or homeschooling . The latter are programs favored by Republicans, like Senator Tim Scott and Representative Mia Love, but anathema to the Democratic policy platform. The CBC should be a venue for debate about these approaches. The caucus wants the best outcomes for black children, but it should champion good ideas regardless of which party favors a certain policy. If partisan allegiances undermine this flexibility, the CBC cannot effectively fulfill its mission. While individual members have responsibilities to their constituencies and their party, the CBC does not.\n\nShedding this veil of partisanship is critical because it will help the caucus improve its image as an honest broker for policy deliberations. Membership in the CBC is open to all black members of Congress. But of the seven black Republicans who have served in Congress since the CBC's creation, only three have joined. Only one of the three currently serving black Republicans are members. And though the CBC PAC aspires to \"increase the number of African Americans in the U.S. Congress,\" if its expenditures are any indication, this only holds true for black Democratic candidates and not Republicans like Will Hurd, the 2014 congressional candidate Erika Harold, or even Representative Love, who is a current CBC member.\n\nThe caucus also misses out on an opportunity to expand its influence by excluding white representatives with substantial black populations in their constituencies. Steve Cohen represents a Tennessee Congressional District that is 60 percent black and includes parts of Memphis, which has the sixth-largest black population out of all American cities. But because he not black, he cannot be part of the CBC. His record, however, shows he has the interests of his black constituents at heart-take, for example, his introduction of and leadership in passing a House resolution that apologizes to African Americans for slavery. While most CBC members have not endorsed black Republicans or even some of its Democratic members like Donna Edwards, they have endorsed Cohen over black candidates challenging his seat in congressional primaries. Yet they can't officially welcome him into their ranks.\n\nThe Congressional Black Caucus remains black America's best hope for having a voice in Congress. No matter what person or party occupies the Oval Office, controls Congress, or the demographic makeup of the Supreme Court, the CBC will be the primary mechanism through which black people can be heard. But this will only be true if the CBC resolves not to become mired in the partisan politics that have stalled Congress, instead giving primacy to the interests of black Americans. The caucus has proven its ability to deliver on policies, but it will need to evolve if it is to usher the nation towards the place where equality and opportunity are available for all. The criticism it receives for not supporting women like Chisholm and Edwards will likely pale in comparison to the damage that's done by losing the support of the next generation of black Americans."

      "text": "How Black Middle-Class Kids Become Poor Adults\n\nOnce they've grown up, African American children are more likely than their white counterparts to backslide into a lower economic group.\n\nWhen it comes to financial stability, black Americans are often in much more precarious financial situations than white Americans. Their unemployment rate is higher, and so is the level of poverty within the black community. In 2013, the poverty rate among white Americans was 9.6 percent, among black Americans it was 27.2 percent. And the gap between the wealth of white families and black families has widened to its highest levels since 1989, according to a 2014 study by Pew Research Center.\n\nThe facts of this rift aren't new, or all that surprising. But perhaps what's most unsettling about the current economic climate in black America is that when black families attain middle-class status, the likelihood that their children will remain there, or do better, isn't high.\n\nAmerican Income Distributions, by Race\n\n\"Even black Americans who make it to the middle class are likely to see their kids fall down the ladder,\" writes Richard Reeves, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. In a recent blog post Reeves says that seven out of 10 black children who are born to families with income that falls in the middle quintile of the income spectrum will find themselves with income that's one to two quintiles below their parents ' during their own adulthood.\n\nA 2014 study from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, which looked at factors like parental income, education, and family structure, shows a similar pattern: Many black Americans not only fail to move up, but show an increased likelihood of backsliding. According to the study, \"In recent decades, blacks have experienced substantially less upward intergenerational mobility and substantially more downward intergenerational mobility than whites.\"\n\nThe greater probability of slipping back applies to blacks across income groups. According to the Fed study, about 60 percent of black children whose parents had income that fell into the top 50 percent of the distribution saw their own income fall into the bottom half during adulthood. This type of downward slide was common for only 36 percent of white children.\n\nBut the gap in mobility was also significant for lower-class families as well. \"For most of the bottom half of the income distribution, the racial differences in upward mobility are consistently between 20 and 30 percent,\" writes senior economist Bhashkar Mazumder, the study's author. \"If future generations of white and black Americans experience the same rates of intergenerational mobility as these cohorts, we should expect to see that blacks on average would not make any relative progress.\"\n\nThe explanations for this phenomenon are varied, but largely hinge on many of the criticisms that already exist in regard to socioeconomics and race in the U.S. Economists cite lower educational attainment, higher rates of single-parent households, and geographic segregation as potential explanations for these trends. The latter determines not only what neighborhoods people live in, but often what types of schools children attend, which could play a role in hindering their educational and professional attainment later on. According to Reeves, \"In terms of opportunity, there are still two Americas, divided by race.\"\n\nStill, most economists lack a clear, definitive explanation for why, after reaching the middle class, many black American families quickly lose that status as their children fall behind.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

      "text": "Black America's Neglected Origin Stories\n\nThe history of Blackness on this continent is longer and more varied than the version I was taught in school.\n\nThis article was published online on May 4, 2021.\n\nWhen I was growing up in Conroe, Texas, about 40 miles north of Houston, my classmates and I took Texas history twice, in the fourth and seventh grades. We learned about Texas's history in the United States, its previous existence as a republic, and its time as a province of Mexico. Among other things, we were exhorted to \"remember the Alamo\" and \"remember Goliad,\" famous events in Texas's fight for independence from Mexico. Some other aspects of the state's history were less covered. I didn't need school lessons to tell me that Black people had been enslaved in Texas, but in the early days of my education, the subject was not often mentioned.\n\nSome of our lessons did, however, involve the \"period of Spanish exploration.\" And I remember hearing in those lessons stray references to a man of African descent-a \"Negro\" named Estebanico-who traveled throughout what would become Texas. Estebanico was described, according to Andrés Reséndez's book A Land So Strange: The Epic Journey of Cabeza de Vaca , as a \"black Arab from Azamor,\" on the coast of Morocco. A Muslim, he had been forced to convert to Christianity and sold away from his home to Spain; he eventually found his way to Texas in the company of the famous explorer Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca. He arrived in the area of the future Galveston, where Union General Gordon Granger would proclaim the end of the Civil War and the end of slavery in Texas more than 300 years later, on the day now known as Juneteenth. Estebanico's journey across Texas as an interpreter for Cabeza de Vaca made him one of the first people of African descent to enter the historical record in the Americas. He was part of a cohort of African people who predated plantation slavery in the Americas, and had stories and legacies outside that institution. And the time in which he entered the story of the continent-in the 1520s-is roughly a century earlier than when the most popular stories about Black people in America begin.\n\nThe arrival in Virginia in the early 1600s of \"20. and odd negroes,\" as John Rolfe announced, is often taken as the beginning of what we might call Black America-from that 20 to nearly 47 million souls today. Historians study those earliest years to, among other things, pinpoint the beginning of American slavery. They also look to this time to see if they can discover how deeply ideas about race were embedded in the culture of the people who established the English colony in Virginia. From these histories, people create and curate origin stories, of both themselves and the ideas they hold. And what these stories leave out-including Estebanico, the period of Spanish exploration, and years of Black and Indigenous history on the continent-is as important as what they include.\n\nOrigin stories matter, for individuals, groups of people, and nations. They inform our sense of self, telling us what kind of people we believe we are, what kind of nation we believe we live in. They usually carry, at least, a hope that where we started might hold the key to where we are in the present. We can say, then, that much of the concern over origin stories is about our current needs and desires, not actual history. Origin stories seek to find the familiar, or the superficially familiar-memory, sometimes shading into mythology. Both memory and mythology have their uses, even if they must be separated from the facts of the past. But in the case of Black people, the limitations of the history and possibility of our origin stories have helped create and maintain an extremely narrow construction of Blackness.\n\nThe two origin stories that American children are most often taught are those of Jamestown, Virginia, an English colony founded in 1607 as a moneymaking venture, and Plymouth, Massachusetts, where people escaped religious persecution in 1620. The latter narrative is more inspirational and more in keeping with America's sense of moral exceptionalism than the former, which is perhaps why it has tended to loom larger in the American mind. Both origin stories emphasize the triumph of amity over enmity between Indigenous people and English settlers, something very different from what actually happened. But Black people are absent in the story of Plymouth, and the role of Jamestown as a hub of chattel slavery is often minimized. For Black Americans, neither origin story is sufficient.\n\nAnother origin story might be more suitable. St. Augustine, Florida, was not at all a part of my early education, but it's where race-based slavery, as an organized system, began on American soil, established by the Spanish as early as 1565 . Enslaved and free African laborers helped build the settlement and its fortifications. In 1693, the king of Spain offered freedom in Florida to enslaved people who escaped from the British colonies if they converted to Catholicism and swore their allegiance, and in 1738, the Spanish governor established a settlement for them in St. Augustine. The story of Africans in St. Augustine is rich, as documented in surviving parish records. The settlement of free Blacks existed in some form until the British acquired Florida in the Treaty of Paris in 1763.\n\nI had heard of St. Augustine by the time I got to college. But even then, it was presented as a historical footnote. The English had \"won\" the contest against the Spanish in North America-in Texas and in Florida. What was the point of incorporating this story of Africans and Spanish people into the general narrative of American history or, more specifically, the history of African Americans? The same could be said of the French, in their beaver-trapping colonies near the Great Lakes. They were \"also rans\" in the race for the territory that became the United States. The French influence in Louisiana-its civil-law approach to marriage, its stratification of people of African descent into several social spheres based on white ancestry, the French Quarter in New Orleans, the arrival of Cajuns (descendants of the people exiled in the 18th century from the French colony Acadia by the victorious British)-has been treated as mere seasoning for a culture almost universally recognized as Anglo-American. Similarly, the brief period of Dutch slave ownership in New York is almost totally out of the picture.\n\nThe story of Estebanico is part of this historical marginalia. Estebanico came to the Americas with the man who enslaved him, Andrés Dorantes, and Cabeza de Vaca, two of the leaders of a 300-person expedition to Florida and lands west. A series of disasters-food shortages, illness, and skirmishes with Indigenous people-spurred them to cross the Gulf. The men built rafts and split up, 50 men to a raft.\n\nDorantes, Estebanico, and most of the men on their raft made it to Texas, as did Cabeza de Vaca and most of the men on his. The other parties landed south of them and died as a consequence of either attacks by Native Americans or starvation. Dorantes's party made contact with Cabeza de Vaca and his party. Many died during a cold and hard winter. Estebanico ended up in a small group with Dorantes, Cabeza de Vaca, and another man. Their ordeal moved into another phase when they were enslaved by Indigenous groups living along the Texas Gulf Coast. The men endured almost six years of slavery but eventually managed to escape. They then embarked upon an epic journey, walking for about 10 months across Texas and Mexico to the Pacific Coast.\n\nEstebanico's talent for languages might seem to mark him as exceptional, but actually helps us understand the multilingual nature of slavery and enslaved people.\n\nCabeza de Vaca, who wrote a widely read memoir about the extraordinary adventure, noted that Estebanico had played a key role as the chief translator between the Spaniards and the Indigenous people they encountered along the way, because of his great talent for learning and speaking languages. Estebanico appears to have achieved a measure of respect among his fellow explorers, but that respect disappeared once he and his fellow wanderers came upon a group of Spaniards in what is now Sinaloa State, in northwestern Mexico. Once they were safe and back among a strong complement of other Spaniards, Estebanico's Spanish companions were again in their element, and Estebanico was, again, their slave.\n\nLike Estebanico's journey, the experiences of so many other Black people and communities have been pushed to the sidelines, held in thrall to the prerogatives of white storytellers and the needs of white origin stories: The United States' own nationalist-oriented history focuses intensely on what happened within the boundaries of the British colonies, and on the perspective of English-speaking people. The world enclosed in that way leaves out so much about the true nature of life in early America, about all the varied influences that shaped the people and circumstances during those times. That focus prevents vital understanding about contingency-how things could have taken a different turn.\n\nAccording to the conventional narrative with which most Americans, it is safe to say, are familiar, Black people came to North America under the power of the English from places that were never clearly identified, because where they came from didn't matter much. They went from speaking the languages of their homelands to speaking English. They worked on plantations, in the fields or in the house. This highly edited origin story winds the Black experience tight. To be sure, the institution of slavery itself circumscribed the actions of enslaved Black people, but it never destroyed their personhood. They did not become a separate species because of the experience of being enslaved. All of the feelings, talents, failings, strengths, and weaknesses-all of the states and qualities that exist in human beings-remained in them. There has been too great a tendency within some presentations of enslaved people to lose sight of that fact, in ways obvious and not.\n\nWe can see this tendency in the historical treatment of that most basic of human traits: the ability of enslaved people to acquire language and speak. Estebanico's talent for languages might seem to mark him as exceptional, but actually helps us understand the multilingual nature of slavery and enslaved people. For example, Dutch was the first language of the noted abolitionist Sojourner Truth, born Isabella Baumfree in Swartekill, New York, near the end of the 1790s. She almost certainly spoke English with a Dutch-inflected accent. Yet reproductions of her speech were written in the stereotypical dialect universally chosen to portray the speech of enslaved Black people, no matter where in the country they lived. Under this formulation, the experiences of growing up hearing and speaking Dutch had no effect on Truth. It was as if the legal status of being enslaved and the biological reality of having been born of African descent fixed her pattern of speech, almost as a matter of brain function.\n\nWhen I was working on my first book , writing about the way historians had handled the story of Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings, I noticed that one line of attack on the veracity of Madison Hemings's statements to the journalist Samuel Wetmore, in which he said that he was the son of Jefferson and Hemings, was to suggest that they were unreliable because they had been recorded in standard English. The notion that a formerly enslaved person could speak that way was treated as presumptively incredible. Even a brief thought about the circumstances of Hemings's life, viewing him as a human being, tells a different story. Hemings's recollections make clear that his older siblings-Beverley and Harriet-left Monticello to live as white people. Both married white people who may not have known that their spouses were partly Black and had been born enslaved. The communities where they lived evidently did not know that either.\n\nHow did Madison Hemings's siblings live convincingly as white if they spoke in the dialect applied universally to enslaved people? Why would Madison speak differently than his siblings? Taking into account the Hemingses' actual circumstances would have proved absurd the assumption that Madison Hemings could not have spoken in the way portrayed in his conversation with Wetmore.\n\nA similar analysis, or lack of analysis, has often been at play in writings about the Hemings children's mother, Sally. As I have traveled the country talking about the books I have written about the Hemings family, I've been struck by the responses to the fact that Sally Hemings and her brother James learned to speak French during their years in France. On several occasions I have been asked, with seeming wonder, how they could have learned to speak French. How could they have gotten along there? Because slavery in the United States was racially based, it was easy to graft the legally imposed incapacities of slavery onto Black people as a group, making incapacity an inherent feature of the race.\n\nPerhaps there is something about French, for a long time the language of diplomacy and culture. It is considered \"fancy\" in a way that goes along with the country's cuisine and vaunted high fashion-haute cuisine, haute couture. What of individuals born at the lowest rung of society? Could enslaved people, Black people, ever lay claim to sophistication? More than a century after James and Sally Hemings's time in France, Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan, while contemplating a crisis in Haiti, exclaimed, \"Dear me. Think of it. N*****s speaking French.\"\n\nThe fiction that has African Americans naturally speaking in a particular way, or unable to learn a language, slyly promotes the notion that Black people are somewhat less than human. At the very least, the ideas about Black people and language convey the supposed gulf that exists between the races. Editors and interviewers for the Federal Writers' Project ex-slave narratives of the 1930s, which gathered the recollections of formerly enslaved people, engaged in a concerted effort to render the speech of the interviewees into stereotypical Black dialect. As a result, the accents and speech of all the interviewees-whether from Virginia or Georgia or Texas-appear exactly the same. The exaggerated dialect was supposed to signal \"authenticity\"-an authenticity defined by incapacity.\n\nFrom the March 2021 issue: Clint Smith on the Federal Writers' Project Slave Narratives\n\nI don't recall whether Estebanico's language skills featured in the fleeting mention that was made of him in my early education. I do wonder what difference it might have made to my and my classmates' understanding about the enslaved to have had a more fully realized example of someone who displayed such perseverance and talent. Estebanico was a flawed man-there were complaints about his treatment of some of the women he encountered, and he ultimately died in a hail of arrows, killed by Native Americans after he insisted on taking gifts of \"turquoise and women\" from them-but even these negative notes would have helped us see him as a human being with strengths and weaknesses. We would have encountered a known person, to substitute for the nameless people in cotton fields who, at least in my education, never broke out or appeared as anything other than fungible agricultural workers. Of course, I know now that the lives of enslaved field-workers were more complicated than portrayed during my childhood, and worshipping heroism, as typically defined, works against the idea that the lives of common people count and hold lessons for us as well. But learning that the Spanish explorers and the Indigenous people they encountered and lived with at times relied on Estebanico to help them speak with each other brings another dimension to our understandings about slavery and the people enslaved.\n\nEven more, knowing that some of the Black people who came to the Americas with the Spanish went off on their own to lead expeditions in Mexico, Central America, and South America would have altered the framework for viewing people of African descent in the New World. Africans were all over the globe, having all kinds of experiences. Some founded free settlements, decades before the English arrived. Some, like Estebanico, were instruments of conquests. Some became bound to the institution of chattel slavery. But in all that, one thing is certain: Blackness does not equal inherent incapacity or limitation.\n\nOver the past several decades, academic historians have emphasized that enslaved people in North America did more than work in the fields. The insights from this scholarship have filtered down to public-history sites where enslaved people lived and labored, changing the presentations at those places. If one goes to Colonial Williamsburg, in Virginia, one sees actors portraying enslaved people who were skilled artisans of one sort or another. At Monticello, guides point out the work of John Hemmings, the carpenter and joiner who made furniture for Jefferson and worked on the physical structures of both Monticello and Poplar Forest, Jefferson's home away from home in Bedford County, 90 miles from his mountaintop mansion.\n\nAs has been said many times, Black history is American history. People of African descent, however, occupy a special place in the narrative of the rise and fall of European nations in North America. For all its problems, nationalist-oriented history presented a cogent telling of the origins of the United States, though a superficial one. It made some degree of sense to sunset the influence of the other European nations with which the English settlers contended for control of the continent. American culture continued under the influence of what had been, at the time of the separation, a British society.\n\nBut a closer look at the story of the 20 or so Africans who landed at Jamestown contains a hint of the broader nature of the origin story: The Africans, from the region of Angola, had been taken after a battle with a Portuguese galleon. The Spanish, and their Portuguese neighbors, had been enslaving Africans, working with elites within African societies, for centuries by this time. The English were relative newcomers to the practice. The field of Atlantic history, which studies the era of contact among the peoples of Africa, Europe, and the Americas in the 16th through 18th centuries, began to take hold in the 1980s, when I was in college and law school. It has expanded further, as a challenge to inward-looking nationalist history. Thinking of these interactions as part of a global system makes even more clear that the origin story of Africans in North America is much richer and more complicated than many people like to believe.\n\nWould it make sense for African Americans enslaved under English rule to think they had absolutely no connection to enslaved people who spoke Spanish or French? What enslaved Africans had in common, what really ordered their lives, was the experience of enslavement in a world where the notion of white supremacy was ascendant. National borders cannot contain the experiences shared by families enslaved across the Caribbean and the entire breadth of two continents. There is no reason for the people taken from Africa to define themselves strictly by the countries, languages, or societal roles their captors created. Even though the Spanish \"lost\" Texas and Florida, Estebanico and the Spanish-speaking Blacks of St. Augustine should be seen as a part of the origin story of African Americans. The echoes of that world reverberated from the 1500s through to my classrooms in the 1960s and '70s, and continue to reverberate today.\n\nThis article has been adapted from Annette Gordon-Reed's new book, On Juneteenth .

      "text": "How Mass Immigration Hurts Black Americans\n\nImmigration is among the most wrenching political questions of the 2024 election . Yet, when Congress resumes debate on border security in January, the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) has an obligation to act on behalf of its base. That's because the Black community is disproportionately impacted by the current policy on immigration-and the unpredictable border surges of \"asylum seekers.\"\n\nTo date, the body of 60 members-three Senate Democrats, 55 voting House Democrats and two non-voting-has been missing in action. The skirting of duty is largely the result of being beholden to campaign money, business support, and Hispanic and progressive factions of the party. Now is the time for the dereliction to stop.\n\nCBC members must shed their reticence and shine a spotlight on the mean correlation between the rising levels of immigration and the declining fortunes of Black workers, particularly men.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFor example, the authors of \" Immigration and the Economic Status of African-American Men, \" a 2010 study published in the journal Economia , concluded, \"We find a strong correlation between immigration, black wages, black employment rates, and black incarceration rates. As immigrants disproportionately increased the supply of workers in a particular skill group, the wage of black workers in that group fell, the employment rate declined, and the incarceration rate rose.\"\n\nIn the years since, the surge of economic immigration has eroded the standing of Black labor even more. It caused T. Willard Fair )\" href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.phillytrib.com/commentary/immigration-comes-at-a-devastating-cost-to-black-americans/article_00850999-e7aa-5e2e-9132-2b85d61821aa.html__;!!LsXw!Re98Yj-Aaq4rjeQCyB6rxRkwOFnfcmtOWKZyXntpxr-KkxlVw0gRMH_0MaUXtZJPGPw7nI-Sg9TLar_Gnmfs11rcplBcZtwWsA$\">T. Willard Fair , President and CEO of the Urban League of Greater Miami, to write an op-ed in The Philadelphia Tribune where he questioned the pernicious loyalty of the CBC to the Democratic Party's immigration policy:\n\n\"The lasting effects of uncontrolled, mass immigration on Black Americans are plainly obvious and have been well-documented throughout our country's history,\" he lamented in the March 2022 commentary. \"So how can any Black politician in good conscience advocate for a more expansive immigration policy that would continue to do us harm?\"\n\nClearly, the CBC has a duty to protect the interests of the over 18 million Black Americans it represents, even if it cuts against the grain of the party. No doubt this is a tricky subject for Black Democrats because many take pride in a legacy of supporting non-discriminatory immigration policy. The 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act , which opened doors for legal immigration from Asia and Eastern and Southern Europe, is among such civil rights accomplishments.\n\nIn addition, the CBC has expressed solidarity with the plight of immigrants as \"people of color,\" even though immigrants from predominantly Black countries account for about 575,000 of the estimated 11 million immigrants in the country illegally.\n\nDozens of migrant families are seen arriving from Texas at the Port Authority Bus Terminal in New York City early September 6, 2023.\n\nWhen Congress returns, the CBC must herald how their people are under duress from the helter-skelter border crossings, unclear enforcement policies, red state busing of asylum seekers to blue state sanctuary cities, unpredictable competition for jobs and housing, and lack of progress on immigration reform.\n\nIt means acknowledging the failure of the Biden administration to secure the border-but helping it to find a way forward. To start, it would be prudent to untangle the meaning of popular terms used by the press to describe the border dynamics. For example, most people on the border are permanent economic immigrants. As such, they are not \"migrants\" in the normal understanding of the word and should not be treated as such.\n\nThe term \"migrants'' typically refers to a mass movement of workers within a country, such as the westward migrations of white farmers known as \"Okies\" during the Great Depression, or the relocation of Black sharecroppers to the urban factories during the world wars. Such is not the case for the economically distressed populations passing through Mexico, Central America, Venezuela, Cuba, and Haiti, as described by Project Hope, a non-governmental organization that assists health care workers with crises.\n\nRather than seeking political asylum, most are seeking to take advantage of legal loopholes to bypass the normal immigration process. They freely express a desire for access to work, housing, and permanent residency. They speak of wanting to take care of their families, even as their shortcuts threaten to torpedo American workers.\n\n'Taking from Peter to Feed Paul'\n\nAmerica's history of favorable treatment for immigrants is a window on the status of race and labor in our culture. Black American workers have been diminished by pro-immigration policies ever since slave labor built the country into an economic powerhouse. For example, America used preferential land and labor enticements to recruit European immigrants in the mid-19th century.\n\nThe CBC would be prudent to link the security of Black labor to the best practices recommended for border security and immigration reform; namely, gaining control of the border, reducing illegal economic immigration, shutting down the red state busing activity, and establishing legal pathways to meet the demands of business for workers.\n\nFirst, the CBC should push for inclusive standards for Black labor in skilled industries that attract disproportionate concentrations of immigrant workers. It might propose language that mirrors President Biden's March 2022 executive order 14005 stating that the \"Future is Made in All of America by All of America's Workers.\"\n\nThe CBC might offer similar language in the upcoming debates on immigration legislation-specifically, to prioritize the hiring and training of underrepresented American workers in civil construction. It would reinforce the equity provisions established by Congress in the infrastructure and clean energy laws.\n\nThe construction and manufacturing industries will receive a jump-start from the $500 billion Inflation Reduction Act )\" href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.whitehouse.gov/cleanenergy/inflation-reduction-act-guidebook/__;!!LsXw!Re98Yj-Aaq4rjeQCyB6rxRkwOFnfcmtOWKZyXntpxr-KkxlVw0gRMH_0MaUXtZJPGPw7nI-Sg9TLar_Gnmfs11rcplDEO8i-xQ$\">Inflation Reduction Act , the $1.2 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act )\" href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/06/fact-sheet-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal/__;!!LsXw!Re98Yj-Aaq4rjeQCyB6rxRkwOFnfcmtOWKZyXntpxr-KkxlVw0gRMH_0MaUXtZJPGPw7nI-Sg9TLar_Gnmfs11rcplBmUScScQ$\">Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act , and complementary investments from private companies. It will pay to reconstruct highways, bridges and tunnels, weatherize public buildings, install electric charging stations, construct electric battery plants and electric vehicle factories, and develop wind and solar power plants.\n\nThe projects will require the hiring and training of thousands of skilled workers, many without college degrees.

The city's construction industry employed 374,000 people in 2020-and 53 percent were immigrants. By contrast, the unemployment rate of Black male workers was higher than any other ethnic group.\n\nSecond, the CBC should propose that sanctuary cities seeking bailouts from Washington be required to give the local population first dibs on facilities and services. The failure of authorities in such cities to prioritize their native underserved populations creates a dynamic of \"taking from Peter to feed Paul\" that is abhorrent.\n\nCongress should require sanctuary cities to prioritize the local population for provisions such as homeless shelters, affordable housing units, emergency room and mental health services, education outreach, legal services, and food programs, among others. The populations from the border should have access to older facilities, if room is available.\n\nThird, the CBC should call on the Biden administration to raise seed money for a reparations fund with the same urgency it has done for immigrants. Harris is campaigning on her success in raising $4 billion to help migrating immigrants in Central America. Why not utilize her fundraising prowess towards a development bank for the descendants of slavery and Jim Crow?\n\nFinally, the CBC should demand that immigrants be required to learn about America's struggle against racism and colorism. The colorism system of subtle discrimination based on fair complexions can be deeply rooted in the culture and practices of people from countries with colonial pasts. Black Americans should not be expected to endure the petty slights of color hierarchy with every new surge of immigration.\n\nIn closing, the CBC has an urgent responsibility to defend the needs of Black labor in the pending debates on border security and immigration reform. It would seem to be in the interest of both parties to hear them out.\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

The organization, which had been founded by Carter G. Woodson and Minister Jesse E. Morland, sponsored a National Negro History Week in February. The event coincided with the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass, who are both celebrated by the Black community.\n\nBeing the first of its kind, National Negro History Week inspired schools, communities, and even local celebrities to get involved and stand behind the initiative. Over the next several years, cities across the United States began to recognize the week, and eventually it led to the development of Black History Month. In 1976, President Gerald Ford encouraged the country to \"seize the opportunity to honor the too-often neglected accomplishments of Black Americans in every area of endeavor throughout our history.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWith this in mind, the hospitality health and wellness organization Focus On Health, which I co-founded, has created an initiative called Fill in the Gaps, which runs throughout February.\n\nThe program spotlights the history, hardships, and accomplishments of African Americans in the hospitality industry. We are offering virtual programming geared toward the bartending and service community, including panel discussions, classes, a book club, and a writing workshop\n\n.\n\nWe have also partnered with Speed Rack Academy to offer a digital series of classes taught by top bartenders from across the country, including Ella Louise Bailey, Mimi Evans, Alisha Kaye Neverson, Kapri Robinson, and J'Nai Williams. Topics range from the history of Black mixology to Black culture and its influence on cocktails. All of the classes are free to attend, but those who can donate are encouraged to do so as all proceeds will directly benefit The Pink Agenda and its breast cancer awareness campaign.\n\nPlus, each week Fill in the Gaps will host a panel featuring leading industry experts such as Lynn House, Tiffanie Barriere, Tracie Franklin, and Vance Henderson, as well as a special appearance by James Beard Award-winning food scholar Adrian E. Miller.\n\nAdditional offerings for the month include a Sunday evening book club featuring Ijeoma Oluo's So You Want to Talk About Race? , a writing workshop, an open forum on body image led by psychologist and relationship adviser Dr. Jennelle, and an Instagram Live with graphic designer Kisira Hill, who created all of the graphics for the Fill in the Gaps programming.\n\nYou can also purchase a curated Fill in the Gaps Wellness Box, which features thoughtful gifts by Black artists and creators in honor of Black History Month. Plus, there is a month-long digital auction, including virtual experiences, private cocktail classes, and more, to raise money and awareness for Black-owned charities and organizations.\n\nTo learn more about our programming and to get involved in our organization, visit fohealth.org.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Tim Scott's Vision for America Isn't for Black People\n\nSen. Tim Scott 's life story is inspiring . Hailing from a black family with humble beginnings in South Carolina , the odds were stacked against him, making his ascent to the United States Senate all the more remarkable. With relentless determination and the invaluable support of public education, he blazed a trail through local politics in his thirties, defying expectations at every turn.\n\nScott, the only Black Republican in the Senate, on Monday officially announced he's running for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination . But Scott's vision for the country makes no sense at all.\n\nInstead of boldly bridging the persistent gaps in wealth and racial equality that affected him, Scott's policies would exacerbate them. While his personal journey stands as a powerful testament to the boundless potential of the American dream, his political track record paints a contrasting image-one where the advancement of Black individuals is woefully overlooked.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLet's start with Sen. Scott's record on the economy. When Donald Trump was president, Scott partnered with him on an idea called \" Opportunity Zones .\" The concept was simple and, on its face, seemed promising. The federal government would find Black and minority communities that needed a boost, and inject business and federal investment to revitalize them. However, once the program began, the exact opposite happened.\n\nA study conducted by the Joint Committee on Taxation found a stark and unsettling inequality in investment distribution. Shockingly, a mere one percent of opportunity zones accounted for a staggering 42 percent of the total investment. If that wasn't harrowing enough, an astonishing 78 percent of investments flowed into just five percent of the zones.\n\nDonald Trump shakes hands with Tim Scott during in a working session regarding the Opportunity Zones provided by tax reform in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC on February 14, 2018.\n\nIn combination with these alarming figures, a comprehensive report from The New York Times exposed the cruel reality that numerous Black entrepreneurs seeking funding were systematically excluded from the process. Regrettably, it appears that investors were predominantly fixated on high-return projects within the zones, such as opulent real estate developments, while neglecting the potential of lower-margin initiatives that could genuinely uplift Black communities by creating sustainable jobs and vital services.\n\nThe detrimental impact of Scott's policies on the economy do not end there. Scott was an ardent advocate of the radical Trump tax plan. He unabashedly boasted about his instrumental role in drafting the legislation declaring , \"I helped write the bill for the past year, have multiple provisions included, and got multiple senators on board.\" The plan has proven to be nothing short of a disaster for the very Black working families he claims to champion.\n\nRather than utilizing the tax code as a catalyst for advancing racial equity, such as by bolstering the Earned Income Tax Credit -an invaluable work credit that can provide financial support or reduce federal tax burdens-the Trump-Scott tax law has shamelessly tilted in favor of affluent households occupying the highest rungs of the income distribution. A damning report jointly published by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy and Prosperity Now reveals that white households within the top-earning one percent receive an exorbitant 23.7 percent of the law's total tax cuts. On average , \"white households receive $2,020 in cuts, while Black households receive $840.\"\n\nFurthermore, Scott's track record reveals a troubling pattern of actively undermining avenues of healthcare that could significantly benefit a majority of Black Americans.\n\nOne example is his staunch opposition to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and his efforts to defund crucial healthcare initiatives. Under the ACA, states were granted the option to expand Medicaid, a government healthcare program designed to provide vital care to millions of low-income Americans. While numerous states embraced this opportunity, Scott's own state chose not to participate.\n\nTim Scott hugs his mother Frances as he announces his candidacy for the 2024 Republican presidential race in North Charleston, South Carolina on May 22, 2023.\n\nHe further displayed a lack of support for sustaining Medicaid funding for states that had previously embraced the ACA during the House Republicans' campaign to dismantle it in 2017. Without hesitation, he confidently declared , \"The reality of it is there is no way to get this done if you don't make whole those states that were more fiscally responsible and did not expand.\"\n\nMedical professionals and extensive policy research have shown that Scott's ideas on healthcare are incorrect. A study conducted by the Commonwealth Fund reveals the significant advantages associated with expanded Medicaid eligibility between 2013 and 2021. States that chose to expand their Medicaid programs experienced lower racial and ethnic disparities, providing enhanced coverage and improved access to healthcare services for their populations.\n\nScott's failure to recognize these tremendous benefits further highlights his disconnect from the needs of Black communities, and his disregard for the importance of addressing racial inequities in our healthcare system.\n\nIt is crucial to acknowledge the profound impact that policies such as the ACA and a fair tax code can have in ensuring that all Black Americans have a shot at the American dream. The research unequivocally demonstrates the positive outcomes achieved when the federal government embraces these initiatives. Yet, Scott's record is one of dismantling the progress we've made and reflects a concerning lack of understanding for the struggles faced by Black Americans.\n\nFar from being a singular voting bloc or monolithic entity, the Black community is a diverse tapestry. Anyone who claims otherwise is gravely mistaken. Each voter within this community possesses their own unique set of concerns and priorities that must be addressed by any presidential candidate seeking their support. However, when examining Tim Scott's track record on these critical kitchen table issues that profoundly influence the lives of the majority of Black Americans, it becomes abundantly clear why his candidacy for president should be unequivocally rejected.\n\nThe importance of having leaders who wholeheartedly embrace and address the concerns that shape the lived experiences of Black Americans cannot be overstated. While Scott's personal journey is undeniably remarkable, his absence in championing crucial causes for Black people raises serious doubts about his suitability for higher office.\n\nWe must demand leaders who unwaveringly prioritize the health, well-being, and prosperity of all Americans, regardless of their race or background. Settling for anything less in this critical moment is simply not an option. The urgency of the challenges faced by the Black community demands leaders who will go beyond rhetoric, and deliver substantive policies that uplift and empower. We cannot afford to compromise in our pursuit of a more just and equitable society.\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

(The segment went largely unnoticed until later this week when a clip from it went viral on social media.)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAsserting that Trump's poll numbers have only seemed to improve amid his ever-increasing legal headaches, the most recent involving a $364 million judgment in a New York civil fraud case, Arroyo then contrasted that to Biden's sinking approval numbers among minorities.\n\n\"[Trump] somehow survives, which must drive his opponents crazy, because even the sneaker thing. I was on social media last night. Very interesting as you see Black support eroding from Joe Biden,\" the Fox News co-host declared based on tweets he read.\n\n\"This is connecting with Black America because they love sneakers!\" Arroyo added. \"They're into sneakers... this is a big deal, certainly in the inner city. So when you have Trump roll out his sneaker line, they're like, 'Wait a minute, this is cool!'\"\n\nTaking it several steps further, the conservative commentator-who has previously gotten into hot water with the Anti-Defamation League for peddling antisemitic tropes-continued to plainly argue that Black Americans will be easily swayed to MAGA because of their affinity for high-tops. \"He's reaching them on a level that defies and is above politics,\" Arroyo exclaimed. \"The culture always trumps politics, and Trump understands culture like no politician I've ever seen.\"\n\nRight-wing Fox News contributor Tomi Lahren wondered if the sneaker connection would translate into \"them going out and voting for Donald Trump,\" prompting Arroyo to declare: \"Anybody willing to put 400 bucks down for a pair of sneakers? Yeah, I think that's commitment and love. It's something, it's affection on some level. I don't think this is just for collectors. It's for people who want Donald Trump-brand sneakers that, again, he's connecting on a different level.\"\n\nWhile there is polling that suggests Trump could receive double-digit Black support in the upcoming election-the most a Republican candidate has received in generations-conservatives incorrectly believed Trump would pull in record Black American support in 2020.\n\nIn fact, days before the 2020 election, right-wing media ran wild with a survey from conservative polling firm Rasmussen that found nearly one-third of Black voters would vote for Trump. In the end, Biden won the Black vote 92 percent to Trump's 8 percent.\n\nSenior Media Reporter\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

John Gibbons, a white community minister who leads a multi-ethnic congregation, says many people consider Boston to be \"the Deep North,\" a play on the racist ideologies of the Deep South.\n\n\"In New England, we don't think of New England and the North as a place of slavery, and it did take a different form than it did in the South,\" he told The Daily Beast. \"But we're uncovering more and more evidence of the ways in which all of the prominent families in the founding of Boston were most frequently engaged in slavery.\n\nThe Arlington Street Church through early-morning rain and fog.\n\n\"We've had truly segregated housing. We have virtually exclusively Black neighborhoods, virtually exclusively white neighborhoods and suburbs, and this was done deliberately through the real estate practices of blockbusting and redlining where Black families were given loans but only if they would buy in particular neighborhoods. This has had a devastating effect,\" Gibbons said. \"There are deep roots of racism in the North, and in Boston in particular.\"\n\nBoston People's Reparations Commission Co-Director Edwin Sumpter, who shares the role with Heather Cook, said that Black Americans have given so much to the country but still suffer from the effects of enslavement and its aftermath with poor \"housing, crime, joblessness, over policing, all the policing, health, environmental.\"\n\n\"They ought to be willing to give back to those communities that have been so hurt by the fact that for the 300 years or so in the United States, Black people really got a low stock in terms of realizing the quote-unquote 'American Dream.' For so many years for us, it was an American nightmare,\" Sumpter said. \"Even after slavery ended in 1863, 1865, it was still another 100 years before the Civil Rights Bill was signed.\"\n\nHe added that progress will be made when the Black community isn't the last group to the table to discuss reparations.\n\n\"We're the ones who reparations are going to impact. Without depending on the city to keep our community involved or engaged or educated on reparations... we just want to make sure that there's some consistency going on... to whatever conclusion this all comes to.\"\n\nIn 2022, Boston established that there would be a Reparations Task Force to study the \"legacy of slavery in the city and its impact on descendants today,\" according to the group's website. But local leaders say the research is taking too long to show results.\n\n\"From my point of view... there needs to be more pressure for action and for moving forward and considering economic reparations in a variety of ways,\" Gibbons said.\n\nGibbons says his social justice group, the New Democracy Coalition, helped push for the Boston City Council's 2022 apology for the city's involvement in the enslavement of Black people and the creation of a reparations task force.\n\nHe said the group has been working directly with the Boston People's Reparations Commission-a band of local Black activists who partner with other progressive groups throughout the city-and its appeal for reparations.\n\n\"We have demanded $15 billion, and usually we say $15 billion is not enough,\" he said.\n\n\"[The $15 billion] is a way of saying that the damage done by slavery has been incalculable over the generations, not just to those who were enslaved, but to the cascade and generations that have been harmed by white supremacy, by racist housing, real estate, employment, education, health practices,\" Gibbons explained. \"We particularly are directing this demand to the financial institutions of Boston and to the white churches and, most especially, to the legacy white churches-by which, I mean the churches that were part of the founding of Boston. Really the economy, the structure, the culture of Boston was founded on the institution of slavery.\"\n\nIn an interview with local news outlet BCAM TV in Massachusetts last month, Boston People's Reparations Commission Co-Director Heather Cook said the city's official task force needed to have more of a working relationship with its constituents.\n\n\"Because there was that gap, we saw that there was a need for there to be the [Boston People's Reparations] Commission,\" Cook said. \"The Boston People's Reparations Commission was created by the people for the people. We're very appreciative of the fact that the city has joined our meetings, is interested in what the community has to say, and truly wants to partner, and that's what the conversation is right now.\"\n\nLate last month, Boston People's Reparations Commission President Rev. Kevin Peterson, who also works with the New Democracy Coalition, called on older church denominations that have predominantly white congregations to join its mission to repair Boston's Black community-monetarily, emotionally, and historically.\n\n\"We call sincerely and with a heart filled with faith and Christian love for our white churches to join us and not be silent around this issue of racism and slavery and commit to reparations,\" Peterson said, according to the Boston Globe . \"We point to them in Christian love to publicly atone for the sins of slavery and we ask them to publicly commit to a process of reparations where they will extend their great wealth-tens of millions of dollars among some of those churches-into the Black community.\"\n\nThe leaders of some churches, a number of which have been around since the 17th and 18th centuries, feel they have an obligation to make the public aware of Boston's history.\n\nOld South Church, Boston.\n\nRev. John Edgerton of Old South Church explained that his church maintained archives of previous members, and in turn, created a memorial to enslaved congregants.\n\n\"We're a very old institution that has been here since 1669,\" Edgerton told The Daily Beast. \"During that period of time, slavery was legal in the colony [of] Massachusetts. We know that those institutions-and institutions of white supremacy in general-are things that are bound up in our history.\"\n\nEdgerton said the Old South Church of Boston had a duty to do historical research considering its legacy.\n\n\"We're in a really good position to do that historical research. That is both an opportunity, and also I feel like it's a responsibility that we have as an institution.\"\n\nRev. Kenneth Young, associate director of the Massachusetts Council of Churches told The Daily Beast the history of enslaved Black people of Boston and its trajectory into the marginalization of the Black community is not a common topic in the city.\n\n\"Not only is it rarely talked about, you think about churches that played a role in that,\" he said. \"Culturally, Boston, particularly, is a place you go to experience a progressive culture... And now the underbelly of it is like, 'How did we manage to get all of this?' Well, some of it happened through enslaving people like they did in the South.\"\n\nTrinity Church in Boston's Copley Square.\n\nRev. Morgan Allen of Boston's Trinity Church said while his church did not directly enslave people according to its records that have been found, he recognized that its members were probably patrons of various industries that profited from enslaved Black labor.\n\n\"Trinity's commitment to repair looks not only to our community's past, but into our present and future,\" Allen wrote in an email. \"Trinity launched and continues to support a separately incorporated, non-profit, Trinity Boston Connects )\" href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://trinityconnects.org/?gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI0bzKuYGrhQMVFGBHAR0XSwFLEAAYASAAEgKnxfD_BwE__;!!LsXw!VwNWz4ozylHFBcYYmckRHh9RNlWp4xAxyRZGxIIEUhbDst-P3Q1h61lLh1gDribmTTTrIgkZIaNlx82e0vcXuIPmpF0L2PGwH_M$\">Trinity Boston Connects (TBC), which heals the traumatic impact of systemic racism on youth of color in the City of Boston.\n\n\"There has never been a time when Trinity Church was not a multi-racial community. From our founding in 1733, church registers testify to baptisms, marriages, and burials of people of color. Records identify some Black persons as 'free,' while we also expect that before Massachusetts abolished slavery in 1783, some were likely the enslaved servants of white parishioners,\" Allen wrote. \"In the nearly 300-year history of Trinity Church, our parishioners remained-and remain-entangled in structures and systems of racism, even while we continually seek justice.\"\n\nSumpter said that Black Americans were treated like \"less than second-class citizens\" until the Civil Rights Movement and that the only way for the country to prosper is if everyone operates collectively to uplift the community as a whole.\n\n\"African Americans in the 21st century... are in positions because of what African Americans in the 16th and 17th and 18th century had to endure,\" Sumpter said, explaining that he doesn't want the Black community to be in the dark as the City of Boston's Reparations Task Force \"sits on their hands\" and ultimately decides what to do.\n\n\"When this whole reparations situation moves forward, we just want to make sure the community moves forward with it.\"\n\nFor Gibbons, he says the \"issues are too important to be given to a study commission\" without any action.\n\n\"We can't get [progress] until there is some means of addressing the damage, truly genocidal damage that was caused to Black Bostonians and Black Americans,\" Gibbons said. \"I feel these issues are too important to be left to the Black community to be responsible for white institutions. White people need to acknowledge our complicity over the generations. And sure, it means research and understanding the history.\"\n\nMayor Wu says she hopes to begin implementing the task force's recommendations, once they are made, by the summer of 2026, to mark the 250th anniversary of America's founding, reported local outlet WBUR .\n\nCommunications for the City of Boston's Reparations Task Force did not respond to The Daily Beast's requests for comment for this article.\n\nRace and Identity Reporter\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Here's How Black Men Have Already Won the 2024 Election\n\nMy entire adult life-much of which I've spent covering politics-I've wondered what it must feel like to be one of those voters candidates try desperately to win over. As a Black woman I've never experienced this, because both major parties just assume I'm voting for a Democrat. After this election, however, that may no longer be the case. And that's thanks to Black men.\n\nBefore liberal Twitter melts down, yes, I know Democrats have spent billions of dollars targeting Black voters over the years. But those dollars are usually focused on \"turnout.\" The thinking goes: everyone knows who Black Americans vote for; the only question mark is how many of them will show up at the polls. No one treats the white working class that way. Political operatives spend countless hours trying to find ways to appeal to \"Reagan Democrats\" and their heir apparent, \"Obama-turned-Trump voters.\" Then there's always those \"soccer moms\" in the burbs who we're told can sway an election.\n\nBut guess who can sway an election too?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBlack Americans. We've just rarely been treated that way-until now. After this election, we should be, thanks to polling and predictions that Donald Trump will win more Black votes than previous GOP candidates, and more Black men's votes in particular.\n\nFor all of the outrage directed at Barack Obama over his comments chastising lackluster Black male support for Kamala Harris , more should be directed at the Democratic Party as a whole . Democrats would never have the audacity to say to any other group, \"I don't have to tell you what we'll do for you. All I have to tell you is that I'm not the other guy and that should be enough. Okay?\" And yet this has long been considered an acceptable strategy for Black voter outreach-particularly if Black candidates are running.\n\nThat strategy has hit a speed bump this election cycle for a few reasons. The most obvious one is that, despite dire warnings about Donald Trump's racist past -whether in his treatment of Black tenants , his campaign against the Central Park Five or even his non-plussed, \"lovefest\" response to the rhetoric at this past weekend's rally in New York City's Madison Square Garden-it turned out his first term as president was not the second coming of Reconstruction. Trump nominated conservative Supreme Court justices hostile to civil rights measures, but we also know that any Republican president have done the same. He continued to make racially offensive comments, but the truth is if you're a minority, you know some powerful people say horrible things about people like you. They just usually have the decorum and intelligence to hide it.\n\nIn essence, Trump turned out not to be the Klan hood-wearing bogeyman that I and many others had feared-rather, just a regular conservative bogeyman.\n\nSo while many voters-and many Black voters-will look at Trump and see a bad man, the fact is that if no one voted for bad, or women, the halls of Congress would be sparse.\n\nWhat seems to be unnerving Democrats is that Black Americans are beginning to focus on issues that matter to them as individuals, not simply issues they have been told should matter to everyone who looks like them. Democrats know this is bad because a number of the issues Harris and her running-mate Tim Walz are struggling to connect with voters on are ones that impact Black people more than others.\n\nIt's hard to channel rage about someone's rhetoric, no matter how crass, if you are having trouble putting food on the table or gas in the car due to inflation. Illegal immigration strains resources in cities with large Black communities; furor over trans athletes' inclusion in collegiate sports (and the silencing by liberals of even reasonable queries on this issue) has the potential to impact Black Americans who rely on athletic scholarships as a pathway to higher education-and the middle class. People already struggling to hang on to a lower rung of the economic ladder don't implicitly hate others trying to get on the ladder themselves. They simply fear that at some point the ladder will break-because it will.\n\nBlack Americans have a complicated history with political labels. For decades, many identified as Republicans since that was the party of Lincoln, and his role in ending slavery was a pretty solid reason to inspire loyalty. But Southern Democrats who broke ranks in the Civil Rights era and joined the GOP establishment resulted in a seismic shift in Black Americans' party allegiance. People like my parents, who grew up under segregation, had good reason to trust the party of LBJ over what became the party of Strom Thurmond.\n\nDecades later, research on younger Black voters conducted with famed pollster (and my former professor) David Paleologos, for my 2008 book, Party Crashing , found nearly a third of younger Black voters identified as Independents. But then Obama ran for President. So it's possible we are not seeing a shift inspired by Trump, but one that has been brewing for a long time-Obama just slowed it. Why wouldn't he? You'd be hard-pressed to find a more perfect presidential candidate. He's one of the most gifted speakers, and speechwriters, to grace the Oval Office. He had a compelling personal narrative that connected with Black elites and the white working class. Most of all, he had his wife. Michelle Obama is who many Black women want to be-and who many Black men want by their side, because she's the kind of woman whose own greatness can inspire a community organizer to become President.\n\nKamala Harris does not have the above going for her. She's an adequate candidate, but no Obama-nor is she Ketanji Brown Jackson , who is on the Supreme Court because she's practically perfect. And as far as we have come as a society, we are not far enough that imperfect women and racial minorities get the same benefit of the doubt that men like Trump and Bill Clinton do.\n\nAll of this brings me to why we should be applauding Black men this election cycle instead of condemning them. They are voting on what matters to them-not simply out of fear, like a lot of Black Americans, myself included, have been conditioned to. In my opinion, this is what true freedom looks like.\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "Black People Need a Safe State in America-Let's Make It Georgia\n\nThe trial of the three men accused of slaying Ahmaud Arbery has Black Americans walking on pins and needles once again . Whatever the jury decides, I'm afraid, will fail to address a damming question that the tragic incident symbolizes: How can Black people ever be secure in America?\n\nExecuted by three strangers while jogging in a white neighborhood, Arbery's killing reflects the mindset of domination in the culture of white supremacy : the belief that any random white person has the right to accost and detain a Black person with impunity. Authorities are ready to accept their claims of righteous endangerment-even when they are the instigators of the danger.\n\nYet, the Arbery encounter is just the latest in a series of violent racial incidents that linger in memory: George Floyd , Trayvon Martin , Tamir Rice , Breonna Taylor , Eric Garner , and so many others. The fatal consequences are recounted on television and social media and trigger episodes of post-traumatic stress in the Black psyche.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAdd to these graphic executions the racism inherent in the criminal justice system, and the increasingly unstable antics of states under the spell of Trumpism , and one can wonder if it is time for Black Americans to consider establishing a base for security?\n\nSuch a conclusion runs counter to the direction of Black politics since the Supreme Court decision in the school desegregation cases. After the NAACP emerged victorious in Brown v. Board of Education , Black leaders embraced the illusion of integration even if it meant taking a beating. To be fair, the notion to \" redeem the soul of America \" from its legacy of slavery and Jim Crow had successes and failures.\n\nNearly 70 years later, after generations of racial strife, the climate today suggests that new options may be worth pursuing. In this new century, Black thinkers may want to weigh the merits of establishing a majority-minority state as a political base while still demanding the rights of citizenship across the land.\n\nI do not make the suggestion lightly because I know the anxiety that \"self-determination\" schemes can trigger-does it mean a return to \"separate but equal?\" The question, however, ignores the reality that for many the separate status never ended or did so at a loss of culture.\n\nA project to create a Black-majority state would be in the political and cultural interests of the race. There are examples in U.S. history of vulnerable groups using the structure of federalism to create a safe haven state, most notably the Mormons in Utah. In fact, Black pioneers resorted to the strategy when forming independent towns across the West like Nicodemus , founded in Kansas in 1877.\n\nThe effort to gain effective political control of a state would have advantages like constitutional protections not afforded to cities. Most importantly, the powers of the offices of governor, attorney general, and secretary of state; the appointment of judges, and an executive check on the overreach of white state legislators.\n\nControl of executive offices would further the development of technical experts with skills in public administration, policing and lawmaking, and the direction of the political economy. They would have the ability to bargain with state economic interests and to generate a sustainable presence in the halls of Congress.\n\nToday, states with demographics favorable to a majority-minority voting bloc are Mississippi, Louisiana, Maryland, South Carolina, and Georgia. (There is also the discredited notion of making the District of Columbia a state. This is an old ploy that Democrats hold out to Blacks whenever they want to pander for votes. It is a sad fantasy that I will not entertain-except to say that even if it was possible, the District is unaffordable to all but the wealthy.)\n\nBack to the real states, all have a population of over 30 percent or more and have attracted new migrants in recent years; however, the state I believe most prepared for a campaign of migration for political impact is the state where Ahmaud Arbery was killed-the Peach State.\n\nGeorgia is a linchpin in the once reliable crescent of Southern red states. Now, however, it teeters on the brink of Black political ascendance due to the forces of migration and organization. An estimated 1 million Blacks have migrated south between 1990 and 2010, according to the Brookings Institute . However, the process has unfolded in a scattershot fashion as people sought jobs, climate, family ties, and culture.\n\nThe states of Texas, North Carolina, and Georgia have drawn the largest increase in older people that tend to be reliable voters. Blacks have flocked to the Atlanta area more than any other part of the country in recent years, according to the 2019 Pew Center report, \"A Change in Politics with More Black Voters in the Deep South.\"\n\nWith a population of 10 million-about 35 percent Black-Georgia has become a purple state with the introduction of new voters and grassroots organization. After the 2020 Democratic victories, press reports strained to credit the success to the migration of Asians and Hispanics and to suburban white women. While these groups have contributed, the fact is that Black voters are the engine of political change. And if more folk can be encouraged to relocate it would cement the progress. That is why reactionaries in the state legislature-and vigilantes like the killers of Arbery-are pulling out all the stops to prolong the old ways.\n\nDue to migration, Black Georgians have developed strong political organizations in the secondary cities as well. The number of Black mayors has increased from 42 to 64 in recent years, according to the Georgia Conference of Black Mayors. Atlanta aside, Black mayors have assumed control of mid-size cities like Augusta and Savannah, and smaller entities like Power Springs, Douglasville, and Fayetteville, among others. Leading the bench of political leaders are U.S. Senator Raphael Warnock and Stacey Abrams, the 2018 Democratic gubernatorial nominee-both of whom are poised to be on the ballot in 2022.\n\nMany Black migrants bring needed skills, education, and independent sources of income. They include retirees on pension, self-employed and remote workers, skilled tradesmen, professionals, and university students.\n\nThe cause of political autonomy would be furthered by campaigns to better target the migration process and grow the voter base. That's where cultural and civic groups, and political and commercial stakeholders, can lend a hand. They could stage marketing campaigns and social media outreach to recruit people to the state. It could start by depicting the Peach State as a historic destination for refuge and as a contemporary site for economic opportunity and cultural vitality.\n\nThe marketing could herald the state's role as an early symbol of Black autonomy. Most people know about the civil rights legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Few, though, are aware of the freedom struggles of Africans in the region. Brought to labor in the rice plantations of the Charleston colony, many escaped to the coastal swamps of Georgia as early as 1680. It was an informal underground railroad that relied on settlements known as \"maroon\" colonies.\n\nSuch settlements provided safe havens to other Africans fleeing bondage. They also combined with the increasingly decimated societies of American Indians such as the Yamasee and Seminoles. After the Civil War, the emancipated Blacks of coastal Georgia gained ownership of abandoned lands. In 1865, Union Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman issued Field Order No. 15 that granted them about one-third of the state. The order was later overturned by President Andrew Johnson, the vice president and Confederate sympathizer who assumed office after the assassination of President Lincoln.\n\nIn addition to appeals of history, marketers could highlight business and job opportunities in the state that generated about $540 billion in economic activity in 2019, according to IBIS World . Among the top services was health care-a sector that would be crucial in promoting a destination for Black retirees.\n\nMarketers can tout the opportunities for professionals and people with trade skills in the growth industries: These include construction, transportation, corporate management, manufacturing, real estate, finance, energy production, waste management, and entertainment.\n\nAnd with the advent of remote working, some people can live in low-cost satellite cities with affordable housing and work for out-of-state companies. Savannah has implemented incentive programs to attract people with technical skills; and when people spread out, they also increase their leverage in the politics of the state. One way to draw university students is to promote the Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Georgia Tech, University of Georgia Athens, and other schools and cultural institutions.\n\nNow some have argued that a Black majority state would be easily exploited by companies seeking low-wage labor; others that it would suffer disinvestment and become a region of poverty and \"Black on Black\" crime. Another concern is how a campaign for a majority state will be received by people of other races and ethnicities or by Blacks resistant to the notion?\n\nNo doubt some people would be pleased at the prospect of Blacks leaving their city or suburb. Many are tired of the controversy of race and activists \"begging\" for inclusion in places of white entitlement, while others may be intrigued by a project to create something novel in the Black experience. Some Blacks might be concerned with the image of \"giving up\" on the integration agenda. Yet, they can appreciate the concern that the brutal methods of white supremacy are going to continue unabated; and that the 400-year experience of Africans in the land - and the mounting threats in recent years-speak for themselves.\n\nAlso, a majority-minority state will not change the overall demographics: people will continue to inhabit the ghettos of the Midwest, Northeast, and South and have marginal presence in the suburbs. Also, whites and other groups will continue to live in Georgia as allies or competitors. In short, the vision of a Black majority state does not entail walking away from creating a more perfect union; it only concedes that a safe haven may be a necessary component.\n\nAnd have not other ethnic groups established majority (or near-majority) populations in states? By virtue of America's expansionist history, there are Asian majorities in Hawaii, Hispanic near-majorities in New Mexico and California, and white majorities in most places.\n\nWhile the concerns are all serious, over time the advantages of establishing a majority-minority state could come to outweigh any potential disadvantages. What remains urgent is that the Ahmaud Arbery outrage is the latest testament to the intransigence of white supremacy-and the need for a safe state.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Traveling While Black Can Be Downright Bizarre\n\nI'm not really \"from\" anywhere -at least not in the way most people might experience this idea-belonging to a place, having a particular location one thinks of as home. I'm a dual citizen of Nigeria and the U.S., yet I've been told by Nigerians that I'm not \"really Nigerian,\" and by xenophobic Americans that I'm not \"really American.\"\n\nAs one of the moving pieces in a far-flung diaspora, I've come to find it easier to think of myself as simply black. The more I travel, however, the more I realize that this particular identity exists alongside a complex system of assumptions and perceptions far beyond my control. Traveling while black is often disorienting or downright bizarre: My skin always adds another- other -layer to the experience.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhat I've discovered during my travels is that my race serves, simultaneously, as both a repellent and an invitation, prompting avoidance and intrusion. In places where the locals have had few (or no) interactions with black people, I've been met with a wide range of reactions-some frankly astonishing. Armed with this awareness, I was prepared for almost anything when I embarked on my most recent trip in July. I traveled, mostly on my own, for five months-as I write this stateside, I'm still reeling from reverse culture shock. I traveled through 20 countries: Greece, Italy, France, Austria, Slovakia, Russia, Poland, Scotland, Montenegro, Hungary, Malta, Portugal, Spain, Israel and the Palestinian Territories, Jordan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, the Netherlands, and Belgium. The successful completion of this trip upped the number of countries I've visited to 44, the majority being solo trips.\n\nAs a woman alone, I attract some attention. And as a black woman traveling alone, I'm often an outright curiosity. A common and comical assumption is that I must be a celebrity. I've been called \"Serena\" a few times, though I look nothing like the tennis player. Because of economic and social barriers, fewer black Americans travel than their white counterparts (though this is rapidly changing), so those who do voyage abroad are presumed to be \"special\" in some way. In media portrayals of black Americans, this exceptionalism is well represented in the fields of sports and entertainment. Due to the global dominance of black musical forms, such as hip-hop, the most frequently recurring idea is that I might be a musician. This kind of positive stereotyping is a double-edged sword. In individual cases, it can bring about unearned rewards: As a \"celebrity,\" I'm showered with perks and preferential treatment. But faux-fame isn't as glamorous as it sounds: Requests for pictures get old fast. Unsolicited touching of my hair or skin never amuses me.\n\nI've also experienced the polar opposite of celebrity status. Because black women are often over-sexualized in international media imagery, and because of the rampant sex trafficking of West African women, I've experienced a little-known phenomenon that many outside my circle of experience are startled to learn exists: I am sometimes approached as a prostitute. This summer, it happened in Vienna. A man stopped me to ask, \"How much?\" and I pretended not to speak English or German. It happened again in Hong Kong, while I was casually resting on a bench in the glitz of a gargantuan mall. On previous trips, Barcelona was the major locus of this assumption. Even in the great cities of the world, I find myself pigeonholed into the most small-minded roles.\n\nThese particular incidents made a lasting impression on me because of their outrageousness, but the real story is rather banal: it's the underlying weariness of not belonging. The unrelenting exhaustion of brushing off the perpetual stares, glares, even gasps. The hyperawareness of being a visible outsider can grate and grind you down until you get used to it. At this point in my growth as a globetrotter, I've reached the stage where it's faded into background noise-the anxious edges have softened. Still, one of the questions I ask myself before venturing far outside my comfort zone is how I might be received there (this concern recalls the Green Book , an indispensable guidebook of the Jim Crow era that advised African-American travelers of hostile and friendly establishments).\n\nThis summer, some potential locations gave me pause. I was most nervous about traveling to areas with a recent increase of right-wing populism or xenophobia-Poland, Hungary, and, most of all, Russia. Beyond the usual misgivings many Americans have about visiting our once and ever foe, I was especially intimidated by incidents of anti-black violence against both tourists and its vanishingly tiny resident black population. I worried about whether its nationalistic political landscape and the tense relations between our countries might translate into hostility towards me. I scoured the internet for travelogues or testimonies written by black Americans who'd been to Russia, finding just two. I went back and forth on its inclusion on my itinerary a million times-looking for reasons to stall the grueling, expensive process of obtaining a Russian visa.\n\nI was afraid of everything-of being robbed by street thugs, of being robbed by the police, of being robbed by taxi drivers. One travel guide warned of sharp icicles falling off balustrades and impaling pedestrians. Ultimately, each time I wanted to back out, a quick Google image search or YouTube video tour pulled my heartstrings in the direction of \"yes\"-in spite of the specter of the Cold War lurking just beneath the surface, Russia appeared like a dream I felt compelled to realize. As a reward for eventually insisting on an open mind, my experience in St. Petersburg was indeed magical. I came to regret that I'd prejudged Russia the same way I resist and resent it happening to me. Mark Twain said, \"Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness.\" This proved true.\n\nDoes this maxim also work in the reverse: Can travelers themselves deal a fatal blow to stereotypes held by people in the host countries they visit? I have grown to love visiting countries where they receive very few black tourists-where many people haven't formed preconceived notions about who we are. In these ripe, rare spaces, there exist no preconceptions or schemas until I set them-and I like to surprise. I like to think that my presence makes an impact in a world rife with anti-blackness-that it's ultimately more than just a novelty, and that I engage with locals in ways that promote mutual cultural understanding.\n\nFor me, travel is an inherently political act, even as it is an intensely personal journey. As a third culture kid (one born in West Africa, raised in England, then naturalized as a U.S. citizen), I've always been interested in the intricacies of identities and labels. Particularly fascinating is the language we use to delimit the roles of people who move around the world-\"tourist,\" \"expat,\" \"immigrant,\" \"migrant\"-how and why we apply such terms differently to various groups (and the resulting impact of their use). Their colloquial usage is undeniably racially charged, and skin color is often the primary deciding factor in word choice. Commonly, those who relocate without legal status are called \"migrants,\" yet I've never heard this term applied to that legion of young, white backpackers who move abroad, overstay their visas, and work under the table. The term \"ex-pat\" is usually reserved for white Westerners and not applied to workers of color-even when their migratory patterns tell a parallel story.\n\nThe term \"tourist\" can apply to anyone, but it's usually avoided as a label because most people don't want to attach to themselves the negative clichés associated with this breed of traveler. In my extensive experience as a solo black female traveler, however, a curious reality emerges, particularly when I'm in Europe-in the wake of a refugee crisis, being correctly identified as a tourist (as opposed to a migrant or asylum seeker) routinely affords me better treatment. Often considered gauche, \"tourist\" is a far better alternative to some of the labels-often slurs-hurled at those assumed to exist outside the protected bubble of tourism.\n\nNavigating the linguistic landscape of migration, I stumbled across the delightfully apt English slang word coddiwompler : \"One who travels in a purposeful manner towards a vague and as-yet-unknown destination.\" I now can't imagine traveling any other way than as I do presently-curious, somehow confident, yet somewhat clueless-a fish out of water roaming the world in search of something: the home I never had or a way of life that suits me; an escape from routine; the uncomfortable adventure. Even when I stand apart, I search for connections and commonalities. I do what I've always done-survive amidst cultural chaos. The floundering black girl forced to reinvent herself in dozens of different climates and cultures now does so assuredly, hoping to position herself-a good citizen of a global community.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "You turn to us for voices you won't hear anywhere else.\n\nSign up for Democracy Now!'s Daily Digest to get our latest headlines and stories delivered to your inbox every day.\n\nThe FBI is investigating a spate of racist text messages targeting Black Americans in the wake of Donald Trump's election victory last week. The texts were reported in states including Alabama, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Virginia, addressing recipients as young as 13 by name and telling them they were \"selected to pick cotton at the nearest plantation\" and other messages referencing slavery. For more, we speak with Robert Greene II, a history professor at Claflin University, South Carolina's first and oldest historically Black university in Orangeburg, where many students were targeted. \"Initially when I heard about the texts, I thought it was a bit of a hoax, but ... it quickly became clear that this wasn't just a Claflin problem, it was a national issue, as well,\" says Greene. We also speak with Wisdom Cole, senior national director of advocacy for the NAACP , who says \"this is only the beginning,\" with a second Trump administration expected to attack civil rights and embolden hate groups.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We begin today's show looking at the spate of racist text messages referencing slavery that were sent to Black people across the United States starting the day after Donald Trump's election victory. People in New York, in Alabama, in California, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Virginia, including students at historically Black universities and even middle schoolers as young as 13 years old, reported getting a variation of this message that was addressed to them by name: quote, \"Greetings William Hines, you have been selected to pick cotton at the nearest plantation. Please be ready 11/07/24 5pm SHARP with your belongings. Our Executive Slaves will come to your address in a black SUV . Be prepared to be searched down once you've entered.\"\n\nA similar text message sent to a man in Charlotte, Virginia, read, quote, \"Greetings, Samuel You have been selected to pick cotton at the nearest plantation. Be ready at 12PM SHARP with your belongings. Our Executive Slaves will come get you in a Brown Van, be prepared to be searched down once you've enter the plantation. You are in Plantation Group W.\"\n\nMonet Miller described her reaction when she received the racist text message.\n\nMONET MILLER : I immediately texted the number back, \"Who is this? Oh my god!\" Profanity. And then I even tried to call it. And that's when I found out it was, like, from a fake text - one of those, like, fake numbers, so it had already been discarded.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The FBI and FCC - that's the Federal Communications Commission - say they're now investigating the racist text messages, and the source remains unclear. They just know it comes from TextNow. A Trump campaign spokesman said it, quote, \"has absolutely nothing to do with these text messages.\" This is Georgia's NAACP President Gerald Griggs.\n\nGERALD GRIGGS : Our response is to remind the young people where they come from, who they are, and that we do not sit back and allow people to threaten us without a response - a nonviolent peaceful response, but a forceful response, that this is our country. We're not returning to any plantation. We built this country. We'll continue to make this country move forward and live up to the promise that it gave all the citizens.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Meanwhile, Fisk University, the historically Black college in Nashville, Tennessee, issued a statement calling the messages that targeted some of its students \"deeply unsettling.\"\n\nFor more, we're joined by two guests. In Washington, D.C., Wisdom Cole is with us, senior national director of advocacy for the NAACP . And in Columbia, South Carolina, Robert Greene II, history professor at Claflin University, president of the African American Intellectual History Society, senior editor of Black Perspectives , co-editor of a book titled Invisible No More: The African American Experience at the University of South Carolina .\n\nWe welcome you both to Democracy Now! Professor Robert Greene II, can you talk about what happened at Claflin, the students and others who you hear got these text messages and the response? Claflin is what? The oldest historically Black university in South Carolina.\n\nROBERT GREENE II: Yes, that is correct. And first off, thank you so much for having me on this morning.\n\nI can tell you that I heard from both students about the text messages and also from our campus security force, who sent out an email explaining to folks what the text messages were, to remain calm, but to also remain aware and alert of what was going on. Initially when I heard about the text, I thought it was a bit of a hoax, but I soon began hearing from both students and campus security about it, and it quickly became clear that this wasn't just a Claflin problem, it was a national issue, as well.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And what were the response of students, for example, who got these text messages? I mean, we hear the young woman who said - I mean, she sees the phone number that it's coming from, and she texts back immediately because she was scared.\n\nROBERT GREENE II: Well, certainly, I think for many of our students it was a bit of a surprise to receive those text messages. On the other hand, our generation of students have grown up receiving a lot of text messages from a lot of unknown phone numbers. I think what makes this a bit different was the content of the messages themselves. For many students, they were surprised. They were a bit hurt. And coupled with the actual Election Day results, it has been a pretty frustrating week for many of our students.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Let me ask you, Wisdom Cole - you deal with young people around the country. Talk about what the NAACP has heard. How extensive is this?\n\nWISDOM COLE : You know, these messages are deeply disturbing, right? You know, as you said earlier, children as young as 13 have received these messages across the nation, I believe across 32 states. You know, this is a disturbing message to receive shortly after the election, right?\n\nBut the sad part about it is that this is only the beginning. You know, when we see what's happening in this newly elected administration, we've seen this before - right? - you know, the stripping away of diversity, equity, inclusion, the stripping away of our rights, right? You know, messages like this continue to set a precedent in terms of racism in America, in our schools and in our phones. It's important for us to be able to protect our young people and allow them to understand that they deserve to be in those spaces, that they are a part of our community and our culture, and they're a part of what allows us to propel for our future.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Now, what is the NAACP demanding, Wisdom Cole? I was interested that when the Trump campaign was asked to respond - this came out right after Trump was elected - they responded, \"This has nothing to do with us.\" They didn't go on to say, \"And we consider this vile and racist, and it must stop.\" What exactly are you demanding? What do you understand from the company that was the platform for this? Was it called TextNow?\n\nWISDOM COLE : You know, regardless if you believe it has nothing to do with you, it impacts the future of our country. The real question is: What are you going to do about it? How are you going to ensure that everybody in this nation feels safe, that people feel like they can talk about their community, can talk about their culture, can be embraced, that they do not have this sense of fear?\n\nMany organizers across this nation have been working tirelessly over the last election season to ensure that we get this right. You know, it's important for us to recognize that, moving forward, that there are a lot of things that are particular to our community that is going to be at stake, right? We are seeing an increase - and we've seen this before, right? - increase of racial hate in this country. And so, with messages like this, we have to say enough is enough. We have to say that hate has no place here and that we have to ensure that there are protections for us at the local, state and federal level.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Professor Robert Greene II, I'm interested that you're at Claflin. Both Claflin and South Carolina State are in Orangeburg, South Carolina, a very violent history against African Americans. 1968, the Orangeburg Massacre, one of the most violent, least remembered events of the civil rights movement. February 8, '68, crowd of students protesting at South Carolina State University Orangeburg's only bowling alley, which was segregated. After days of escalating tensions, student started a bonfire, held a vigil. Dozens of police arrived, fired live ammunition into the crowd. Three students were killed, 28 wounded. If you can talk about that history and how people are organizing right now around these messages and the involvement now of various federal agencies investigating?\n\nROBERT GREENE II: Well, certainly, whenever something like this happens to students in Orangeburg, there's always a sense of thinking about what the Orangeburg Massacre means to us in 2024. Both universities have even longer histories of confronting racism than that. Certainly, you have the Orangeburg movement of the 1950s and '60s, which leads up to the Orangeburg Massacre of 1968. Decades before that, you have buildings on both campuses being burned down under so-called mysterious circumstances.\n\nAnd so, for students at Claflin and SC State, the one thing they can take solace in is that they can tap into a long history of activism, protest and resistance against oppression and tyranny. Many of those veterans of the civil rights movement, such as, for example, photographer Cecil Williams, still live in the Orangeburg area even now and offer their help and support of the students in a time like this one.\n\nAs for right now, I think students are organizing not just against the text messages, but they're organizing themselves for a long struggle against the upcoming second Trump administration. But for them, the text messages are in many ways another galvanizing call to resistance and thinking about new and creative ways to resist what they perceive to be a very troubling Trump administration.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And finally, Wisdom Cole, in Washington, D.C., plans are already underway for mass protests on January 18th, two days before the Trump inauguration. How is the NAACP dealing at this point?\n\nWISDOM COLE : You know, at this point, it's really important for us to take the time to dream of a better America, for us to be able to restore ourselves and understand about creative ways in which we can take on the most challenging problems that are going to face us in this new administration. I urge all of my organizers to be ready to defend. Right? There are so many rights that we must protect in this nation. We have to organize. We have to build, so that one day we can win on all levels. It's important for us in this moment in time to understand the power that is within the people and that for us to be able to come together to organize and understand this problem is absolutely necessary, because as we see our rights be stripped away, we're going to slowly realize that we are more common than we know.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Wisdom Cole, I want to thank you for being with us, senior national director of advocacy for the NAACP , speaking to us from Washington, D.C., and Robert Greene II, history professor at Claflin University, the oldest Black university in South Carolina, president of the African American Intellectual History Society, editor of Black Perspectives , co-editor of Invisible No More: The African American Experience at the University of South Carolina , speaking to us from that state.\n\nNext, more than 2,000 people packed the historic Riverside Church here in New York City to discuss America and the war on Palestine, moderated by author Ta-Nehisi Coates. Stay with us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Black Americans are more likely to have chronic health problems and less likely to have insurance. They also make up significant numbers of frontline workers that are still going to work amid the pandemic. Jones is the former president of the American Public Health Association. Her recent piece for Newsweek magazine is headlined \"Coronavirus Disease Discriminates. Our Health Care Doesn't Have To.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . We're broadcasting from the epicenter of the pandemic in New York City. I'm Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh, as we turn to the devastating toll the coronavirus is taking on black Americans, who are disproportionately dying from the virus across the country.\n\nIn Michigan and Illinois, African Americans make up, oh, 14 to 15% of the population but account for 41% of the COVID -19 deaths. In Chicago alone, African Americans account for 70% of the city's deaths, yet just 30% of the population. In Louisiana, one of the hot spots of the virus, African Americans comprise about a third of the population but 70% of the COVID -19 deaths. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who once called the virus the \"great equalizer,\" said Wednesday black people make up 18% of the deaths in the state despite being 9% of the state population. The Latinx community makes up 29% of New York City but 34% of the deaths, many of them in Queens, the most diverse community in the nation. The actual number of deaths due to COVID -19 will likely be never known, as people, often undocumented, those on the margins of society, are dying at home uncounted.\n\nFor more, we turn to Camara Phyllis Jones. She's a family physician, epidemiologist, past president of the American Public Health Association, her recent piece for Newsweek magazine titled \"Coronavirus Disease Discriminates. Our Health Care Doesn't Have To.\"\n\nWhy don't you elaborate on that, Dr. Jones, this issue, and why you see this disparate effect on the African-American population?\n\nDR. CAMARA PHYLLIS JONES : COVID -19 is exposing U.S. racism in a stark new way, because the black and brown bodies are piling up so fast that they can't be - these deaths can't be normalized or ignored. And the way that racism is operating in this pandemic is in two separate fronts. It's increasing exposure to the virus, and it has increased vulnerability to the virus.\n\nSo, increasing exposure to the virus because the way that racism, that structures opportunity and assigns value, has structured our educational opportunities and job opportunities, we are in more front-facing, low-income, underappreciated jobs, where we are part of the essential workforce that really isn't getting its full attention, and certainly not getting the full protection that we need.\n\nRacism has increased the vulnerability of us to this virus, because living in racially segregated communities that are resource segregated, without adequate access to food, and are environmental racism hazard segregated has made us carry in our bodies all of those same diseases - diabetes, high blood pressure, renal disease, asthma - that are making people who get infected to the virus sicker and die faster from it.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : And, Dr. Jones, even before - I mean, we mentioned the statistics everywhere, but in Chicago, even before the pandemic began, the life expectancy of African Americans was nine years - slightly less than nine years less than white people who live in Chicago. So, could you say, Dr. Jones, what you feel should be done? What steps should be taken to compensate for the disproportionate vulnerability of African Americans, Latinx communities in light of this emergency, health emergency?\n\nDR. CAMARA PHYLLIS JONES : Right. I am so glad that you asked me that question, because we can't just look at these statistics and then shrug or say, \"Oh, well, we expected that.\" We have to act.\n\nAnd so, the way that we act is on both fronts. You asked me: How do we act when we recognize that we already - we have chronically been sicker and dying sooner? What that means is, if we already recognize that, we have to move all of the health resources to those areas where we can already expect higher deaths and all. So we should not have black people already burdened with these diseases living in communities where they can't get adequate testing, number one, but adequate access to ventilators and health resources, and they're not. So we need to provide resources according to need. And we can already predict that need.\n\nOn that vulnerability side, the other thing that I really need to say is, you will be seeing now in the news lots of different ways of people trying to say, \"If we have to ration ventilators, well, maybe we should discount people if they have diabetes or whatever.\" We cannot allow that to happen. First of all, we should not be working under a scenario of scarcity, because there's no reason we have to have scarcity. So we should reject that. But certainly, if we do have one ventilator and three patients, there should never be any counting in of \"this person has diabetes or heart disease\" in that allocation. I actually think that if it comes down to that, we need to have a random allocation of those resources. We need to value all individuals and populations equally. That's one of three core principles for achieving health equity.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Camara Phyllis Jones, let me ask you one last question, and then we're going to do Part 2 and post it at democracynow.org. This critical lack of testing that has completely compromised the public health response in this country, you have talked about the fact that that discriminates against African Americans, as well, where people can even get tests.\n\nDR. CAMARA PHYLLIS JONES : Yes, that's true, where people can get tests. But I have to say, the kind of haphazard way that we've approached testing is affecting all of us. It's affecting our ability to alter the course of the epidemic. The way that we're using testing in this country right now is to confirm diagnosis in a very narrow, one person by one person, kind of clinical, in the medical space way. What we -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We just have 20 seconds.\n\nDR. CAMARA PHYLLIS JONES : So, what we really need to do is we need to find out everybody who has the disease, and we need to do a public health testing. Test those with symptoms. Test those - sample those who don't have symptoms, so that we can distribute our resources, so that we can identify and isolate people who have the disease before they're symptomatic, while they're spreading it, and also do contact tracing. That will be for the good of all of us. That way, we don't document the epidemic; we actually can change the course of it.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Camara Phyllis Jones, I want to thank you for being with us. We're going to do Part 2 , post it at democracynow.org. Family physician, epidemiologist, past president of the American Public Health Association, currently Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University fellow.\n\nThat does it for our show. Thank you to all the team that has made this show possible. I'm Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Half of that loss - 6 million acres - occurred over just two decades, from 1950 to 1969, a period largely associated with the civil rights struggle. This mass land dispossession, which affected 98% of black agricultural land owners, is part of the pattern of institutional racism and discrimination that has contributed to the racial wealth gap in the United States. Many of the driving forces behind this land theft were legal and originated in federal policies, as documented by Vann Newkirk, staff writer at The Atlantic. His latest piece for the magazine is the September cover story: \"The Great Land Robbery: The shameful story of how 1 million black families have been ripped from their farms.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I'm Amy Goodman. Over the 20th century, black people in the U.S. were dispossessed of 12 million acres of land. Half of that loss, 6 million acres, occurred over just two decades, from 1950 to 1969, a period largely associated with the civil rights struggle. This mass land dispossession, which affected 98% of black agricultural landowners, is part of the pattern of institutional racism and discrimination that's contributed to the racial wealth gap in the United States. Many of the driving forces behind this land theft were legal and originated in federal policies.\n\nIn a new article on the history of this massive land theft, our next guest writes, \"Unlike their counterparts even two or three generations ago, black people living and working in the Delta today have been almost completely uprooted from the soil.\"\n\nVann Newkirk is a staff writer at The Atlantic , where he covers politics and policy. His new piece, The Atlantic 's September cover story, is headlined \"The Great Land Robbery.\"\n\nCan you tell us what this robbery is, Vann?\n\nVANN NEWKIRK II: Yes. So, the robbery refers to, over the course mostly of the 20th century, in the mid-20th century and beyond, federally funded and federally directed, in some cases, discriminatory effort against African-American farmers, that wound up, by several mechanisms, with those farmers losing, like you said, 6 million acres of land over just 19 years, from 1950 to 1969, and most of it concentrated around the civil rights movement, with a lot of that land being taken, a lot of those funds being denied purposefully, with the intent of keeping black folks from protesting for their civil rights.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, explain this period, this pivotal period, when millions of acres were taken from black Americans, 1950 to 1969.\n\nVANN NEWKIRK II: Right. The federal government has - they installed a couple of programs during the Great Depression that basically created American agriculture as we know it today. They subsidized - heavily subsidized crop growing and controlled prices when commodity prices went too low. And they also promoted the creation of larger and larger and more and more consolidated farms.\n\nThose efforts served to drive lots of small farmers, of all races, off their farms, but it actually manifested, in a kind of novel and even more dire way, in heavily black places in the United States. So, black folks didn't have a whole lot of land, but they did have sizable holdings in places like Mississippi, which I wrote about. But what those federal reforms did is they gave the money to locally elected boards, and in places across the Deep South, black folks could not vote on those boards. So, basically, it gave the plantation owners, their children, their grandchildren, the people who had been on the side of the Confederacy in the Civil War and their descendants - it gave them even more power to dispossess and disenfranchise black farmers. And they used that power pretty extensively, to the tune of almost the entirety of black farming collapsing.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to turn to a video of Willena Scott-White, who is featured in your piece, Vann. The Scott family is one of the few families who were able to reclaim land that was possessed by the USDA . She talks here about what happened to her father's land and what that land means to her family.\n\nWILLENA SCOTT - WHITE : It grieves me that we were denied a history. And that's how I see it. I'm going to try not to cry. It's dear to me that my children know what my ancestors went through for us to be where we are and who we are, because I'm a firm believer that if we don't know our history, then we repeat the mistakes over and over again. My dad's land was taken. It was not foreclosed on by USDA . My dad went in and applied for money to irrigate his beans, because it was so hot. The county agent refused to give him a loan to water his crops. He said, \"Y'all not supposed to be farming like this. Y'all farming like white folk.\" So he cut everything in half that year. This is when they started not being able to get enough money to farm with.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : [inaudible] Atlantic studios. Vann, can you tell us the story of the Scott family, how their land was lost, how they came to regain it?\n\nVANN NEWKIRK II: Willena's grandfather, Ed Scott Sr., he came from Alabama and got over to Mississippi in the late 19th century. He became a titan in his corner of Mississippi, was just an incredibly gifted farmer, was in many ways more well respected than some local white farmers by the white establishment. And he was one of those farmers who was just talented and lucky enough to be able to purchase of plot of land, his first 100 acres, from a local guy, P.H. Brooks, a white landowner. And he became one of the early middle-size landowners, black landowners, in the region. He encouraged all of his children to get their own plots of land - they kept it all in common - and, over the course of his lifetime, built up, just through sheer talent and force of will, about a thousand acres of land. His son, Ed Scott Jr., took over in the middle of the 20th century. He fought in World War II, came back and also became an incredibly talented farmer and farm manager. He also added to those landholdings.\n\nWhat both of them did that marked them as really unique is they managed to not really dabble in or seek out federal funds. They relied - they emphasized, heavily, self-sustainability and leaning on private funding to keep their farm afloat. But in the 1970s and '80s, when we had the major farm crisis and inflation crisis, Ed Scott Jr. had to reach out for federal money. And like Willena said, when he started reaching out, he got a little bit the first year, but then you see the local power structures realize, this guy is maybe farming like white folks. The trucks he drives are a little too shiny.\n\nAnd the real difficulty comes when he tries to get into catfish farming, which is heavily subsidized by the federal government. They only offer him the dollar amount that's about half of the average comparable white farmer, who is, frankly, way less competent than Ed Scott Jr., in the region. He gets half the money they get. So, even starting out on that endeavor, the catfish endeavor, it's doomed from the start. And so, they lose a lot of their land pretty quickly over the '80s and early '90s. And Willena kind of shepherded him through the major black farmers' lawsuit, where they won a lot of it back, on a discrimination case against the USDA .\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, you talk about how, ultimately, Wall Street got very interested in the land. You write, for example, the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association, TIAA , one of the largest pension firms in the country, as well as other corporate entities, that all owned tens of thousands of acres of land in Mississippi and surrounding states - how did these companies come to own this land? And what about the issue of reparations?\n\nVANN NEWKIRK II: Farmland wasn't originally considered a really valuable investment asset. Farmland is volatile. It's difficult to predict from year to year what your yields are going to be, what your rents are going to be. It is an asset that has been considered really below sort of the sterling grade of investment classes. But after the Great Recession, when the dollar weakened, and with the future threats of both climate change and overpopulation really placing a premium both on land and on arable land for the production of food, that's only going to increase in value, farmland became much more attractive to large investors, particularly pension funds. TIAA , which I write about in the piece, is kind of emblematic of the very sudden interest of pension funds in farmland across the United States. Right now pension funds in the Mississippi Delta own more land than black folks do there.\n\nAnd how that connects to my story is, farmland - most of the farmland in the U.S. is owned already. So, where are investors going to look for land from? And it's going to be where it's coming up for auction, where it already is packaged into really large parcels. And that happens most often in the places where it's been stolen from black folks or is being stolen from black folks. So, the Mississippi Delta is where some of the largest portfolios in the U.S. are.\n\nConnecting to reparations, for one, you know, Wall Street is a major interest right now in farmland that was once owned by black folks. And we have to reckon with that. And we have to reckon with the fact that it was United States federal policy that allowed that. So, how do we reckon with the fact that now this lucrative asset class is making money for lots of people, lots of people across the country who have pension funds, maybe even outside the country, and it's not making money for the African-American farmers and descendants of those farmers who lived there, who were enslaved there and who made the land - and who were basically tied to it and were discriminated against there? I think reparations has to be a part of that conversation. You have to start thinking about, if the federal government took this money away, they've got to find a way to invest it back into them. And if you think about this as a federal investment in white farmers, in Wall Street, eventually, why wouldn't it be ethical, why wouldn't it be necessary, for the federal government to invest in black farmers the same way?\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You're talking about something like 12 million acres of land. That's about the size of Vermont and New Hampshire combined. Your final comment, Vann?\n\nVANN NEWKIRK II: Yeah, 12 million acres, it is a staggering amount of land. And it amounts to something north of hundreds of billions to perhaps trillions of dollars' worth of land, legacy, culture lost. That's something -that's titanic. And whatever policy comes next has to be just as titanic.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Vann Newkirk, we want to thank you so much for being with us, staff writer at The Atlantic , where he covers politics and policy. We will link to your latest piece , The Atlantic 's September cover story, \"The Great Land Robbery: The shameful story of how 1 million black families have been ripped from their farms.\"\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

      "text": "You turn to us for voices you won't hear anywhere else.\n\nSign up for Democracy Now!'s Daily Digest to get our latest headlines and stories delivered to your inbox every day.\n\nWe speak with two leading economists about Thursday's CNN debate between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, where the candidates sparred over tariffs, taxes, inflation and more. Trump repeatedly claimed that immigrants coming to the United States are stealing \"Black jobs,\" which is a \"fascist notion,\" says Darrick Hamilton, founding director of the Institute on Race, Power and Political Economy at The New School. Dean Baker, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, says Biden has much to boast about, including strong job growth and falling inflation, but that Biden's delivery was \"very muddled.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nDuring Thursday night's debate, former President Trump slammed President Biden for causing inflation, allowing migrants to take, quote, \"Black jobs.\"\n\nDANA BASH : President Biden, while Black unemployment dropped to a record low under your presidency, Black families still earn far less than white families. Black mothers are still three times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes. And Black Americans are imprisoned at five times the rate of white Americans. What do you say to Black voters who are disappointed that you haven't made more progress?\n\nPRESIDENT JOE BIDEN : They acknowledge they made a lot of progress, number one. The facts of the matter is more small Black businesses that have been started than any time in history. Number two, the wages of Black - Black unemployment is the lowest level it's been in a long, long time. Number three, we're trying to provide housing for Black Americans and dealing with the segregation that exists among these corporate - these corporations that collude to keep people out of their houses.\n\nAnd in addition to that, we find that the impact of - on the choice that Black families have to make relative to child care is incredibly difficult. When we did the first major piece of legislation in the past, I was able to reduce Black child care costs. I cut them in half. In half. We've got to make sure we provide for child care costs. We've got to make sure, because when you provide those child care protections, you increase economic growth, because more people can be in the - in the job market.\n\nSo, there's more to be done, considerably more to be done. But we've done a great deal so far, and I'm not letting up, and they know it.\n\nDANA BASH : You have 49 seconds left. What do you say to Black voters who are disappointed with the progress so far?\n\nPRESIDENT JOE BIDEN : I say I don't blame them for being disappointed. Inflation is still hurting them badly. For example, I provided for the idea that any Black family, first-time home buyer should get a $10,000 tax credit to be able to buy their first home, so they can get started. I made sure that we're in a situation where all those Black families and those Black individuals who provided - who had to take out student loans, that were ballooning, that if they were engaged in nursing and anything having to do with volunteerism, if they paid their bills for 10 years on their student debt, all the rest was forgiven after 10 years. Millions have benefited from that. And we're going to do a whole lot more for Black families.\n\nDANA BASH : Thank you. President Trump?\n\nDONALD TRUMP : And he caused the inflation. He's blaming inflation. And he's right: It's been very bad. He caused the inflation, and it's killing Black families and Hispanic families and just about everybody. It's killing people. They can't buy groceries anymore. They can't. You look at the cost of food, where it's doubled and tripled and quadrupled. They can't live. They're not living anymore. He caused this inflation.\n\nI gave him a country with no - essentially no inflation. It was perfect. It was so good. All he had to do is leave it alone. He destroyed it with his green new scam and all of the other - all this money that's being thrown out the window. He caused inflation.\n\nAs sure as you're sitting there, the fact is that his big kill on the Black people is the millions of people that he's allowed to come in through the border. They're taking Black jobs now. And it could be 18, it could be 19 and even 20 million people. They're taking Black jobs, and they're taking Hispanic jobs. And you haven't seen it yet, but you're going to see something that's going to be the worst in our history.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Former President Trump and President Biden debating last night in Atlanta, Georgia, a CNN debate that was moderated by Jake Tapper and Dana Bash.\n\nWe're joined by Dean Baker, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, author of Rigged: How Globalization and Rules of the Modern Economy Were Structured to Make the Rich Richer . He's joining us from Astoria, Oregon. And joining us in our New York studio is Darrick Hamilton, founding director of the Institute on Race, Power and Political Economy at The New School, also a Henry Cohen professor of economics and urban policy.\n\nWelcome, both, to Democracy Now! Darrick Hamilton, let's begin with you.\n\nDARRICK HAMILTON : Well, clearly, Trump is a more effective messenger. But if we look at substance of policies, his policies are dramatically framed in a fascist notion of relative status, whether he's looking at Black Americans versus white Americans or trying to message to Black Americans. He presents a zero-sum scarcity framework, a threat of another group coming and taking your jobs, as opposed to an economy that flourishes, where there's plenty, where there's investments in our productive capacities, which obviously spills into democracy.\n\nOn the other side, the bravado, the messaging of, basically, \"Here's what my administration - all these great things we did,\" that's problematic when people's lived experiences clearly aren't feeling that. A more effective message would be one where: \"Here are the trajectories and directions in which we're going. We are affirmatively thinking about race when we do our Inflation Reduction Act. We are affirmatively thinking about race when we consider cancellation of student loans, student loan debt.\" That would be a more effective message.\n\nAnd last thing I'll say, really quick, is, beyond either one of the candidates, how we got some of the interventions we got during the pandemic, like moratoriums on foreclosures, moratoriums on evictions, like sending checks directly to the American people, was through political movement, was through agitation. I want to be in a place where we're not reliant on any of these candidates, but we have momentum, we have paradigm change for a new economy that's productive and inclusive for all of us.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Dean Baker, if you can share your thoughts on last night's debate? I think The New York Times put the number of lies at several dozens  by President Trump. What do you think was the message of Trump and Biden?\n\nDEAN BAKER : Yeah, well, the Biden message, unfortunately, was very muddled. I mean, he does have a lot to boast about. I mean, we did get the lowest unemployment rate we've seen in over 60 years. We've had, for Blacks, Black teens, the lowest unemployment rate ever recorded. Same for Hispanics. I mean, it's still way too high, but that's real progress. We saw good wage growth up and down the income ladder, and the strongest at the bottom. So, workers of the bottom decile saw 12% real wage growth since the pandemic. This was really extraordinarily good.\n\nAlso, really important point, the inflation was caused by the pandemic. You had inflation in Germany and France roughly the same as the U.S. You know, I know Donald Trump likes to say Biden's plan was awful, but pretty impressive if you brought about inflation all over the world with his plan.\n\nAs far as what Trump did - maybe he doesn't know - when he left office, unemployment was around 6%, and jobs were not bouncing back. This is a really important point. We were creating 140,000 jobs a month his last three months. It'd take us five-and-a-half years to have gotten back the jobs we lost with that rate of job growth.\n\nThe other things he was saying, close to incoherent. He said them very confidently. But the greatest economy - again, the economy he had, you know, was a decent economy. It continued the growth rate that we saw under President Obama. So, that's good. I mean, but it's hard to really boast about that when he was handed an economy that was growing while the unemployment rate was coming down.\n\nSo, yes, it was, to my view, very painful and really unfortunate that President Biden wasn't able to stand up and, you know, both take credit for what are really impressive accomplishments and point out that Trump was lying.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Saying, for example, that he had created - Biden created - said 15,000 jobs rather than 15 million. He was his own worst enemy.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

      "text": "Project 2025 will 'upend' the lives of Black Americans, new report shows\n\nLegal analysis released by Legal Defense Fund highlights specific harms rightwing plan poses to Black communities\n\nProject 2025 , the 900-page ultra-conservative roadmap that details how the former president Donald Trump and his allies would restructure the US government if he is elected, has specific implications for Black Americans, according to a new report.\n\nThe Legal Defense Fund (LDF), an organization that fights for racial justice, recently released the most in-depth legal analysis of Project 2025's impact on Black communities. It highlights how Black Americans would be harmed due to policies that would weaken anti-discrimination laws; dismantle the Department of Education; threaten Black political power; increase the use of the death penalty (which disproportionately affects Black people); and exacerbate health disparities caused by environmental racism.\n\nKarla McKanders, the director of the LDF's Thurgood Marshall Institute (TMI), the in-house research thinktank that produced the report, said she wanted people to understand the \"larger impact that Project 2025 will have on our democracy and undermining our democracy\".\n\nThe report is written in plain language and has been shared on social media , McKanders said, as the organization wants it to be available to a wide audience. \"The most important part of the report is how Project 2025 will have an impact on individual lives and how those individual lives will be upended through the policy proposals.\"\n\nOf note, she said, are the report's chapters on education equity and political participation.\n\n\"We look at the proposals for dismantling the Department of Education, [which] might be an abstract concept that people hear, but we bring it to a more concrete level in terms of how it will impact individual lives,\" she said. \"If we look at pre-K, Project 2025 proposes to dismantle the Head Start program for pre-K. In the report, we have statistics that show that 28% of the enrollees in Head Start are Black children. While it will undermine education efforts for all children, in particular it will disproportionately impact and widen achievement gaps for Black and Latinx students.\"\n\nThe report says that the impact of Project 2025's implementation would be felt by pre-K students all the way up through college.\n\n\"Project 2025 proposes to pull back Pell Grants, and Black students are overrepresented in terms of the beneficiaries of Pell Grant,\" McKander said. \"Project 2025 is thinking to put all of the responsibility for monitoring schools and discrimination that occurs in schools back on the state and local level.\"\n\nAdditionally, McKanders highlighted the impacts that Project 2025, if implemented, would have on Black political participation and political power. The plan seeks to replace civil servants with political appointees, something that would likely eradicate nonpartisanship in existing federal positions. McKanders used the Census Bureau as an example of the consequences of such appointments.\n\n\"If the Census Bureau is dismantled, that will impact the undercounting of Black communities, and then that will trickle down to disproportionately impacting the allocation of both political seats and resources for the Black community through federal funding,\" she said.\n\nFor the last decade or so, the TMI has conducted research on water rights and water equity. As natural disasters and man-made environmental disasters have a disproportionate impact on Black communities, the dismantling of existing federal agencies that aim to provide some relief from disaster victims would in turn have particularly harmful effects for Black and brown populations.\n\nSign up to This Week in Trumpland\n\nA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nIf Project 2025 were successful, agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) would be either dismantled or gutted. As the former is integral in setting environmental standards and the latter aids disaster victims, the loss of either, especially in the context of Hurricanes Helene and Milton, could be particularly disastrous.\n\n\"The resources that the federal government provides when there's a natural disaster are instrumental in getting communities back on their feet,\" McKanders said. \"The report goes through what we've done so far in terms of ensuring that there is equal access to environmental resources and how Project 2025 is seeking to dismantle, to do away with some of those resources. The main point is how this exacerbates existing inequities for Black communities.\"\n\nMuch of the existing focus on Project 2025 so far has been \"abstract\" or focused on the broader idea of undermining democracy, but McKanders believes it is important to highlight the direct effects it will have on people. Still, she acknowledges that people in some states such as Georgia , where at least two women died from restrictive abortion care, or Oklahoma , where diversity, equity and inclusion efforts are banned at public institutions, are already living with proto-Project 2025 policies.\n\n\"In certain areas [we] can already see how individual lives are upended and we really want this to be a tool for people to understand what this will do and how it will impact their individual lives.\""

      "text": "Returning to the south: what can 'reverse migration' do for Black Americans?\n\nIn a new HBO documentary, writer Charles Blow explores how moving to the south could lead to important political and societal change for Black Americans\n\nFrom 1915 to 1970, an estimated 6 million Black Americans left their homes in the south, fleeing Jim Crow laws and racial violence to seek out new beginnings in the north and the west.\n\nFive decades later, the New York Times columnist and author Charles Blow says it's now time for these Black Americans and their descendants to return.\n\nIn his 2021 book, The Devil You Know: A Black Power Manifesto, Blow argued that the way for Black Americans to truly overcome white supremacy and effect social change was to gain political power. They could do this, he said, by moving back to the south and concentrating their voting potential in key southern cities that already have large Black populations - and eventually take political control of certain states.\n\nSouth to Black Power, a HBO documentary, picks up where Blow's book left off by looking at some of the reverse migration that has already happened. The film follows Blow as he speaks to historians, activists and local politicos who have moved back to the south - some finding success in community organizing and others still fighting within a broken system.\n\n\"From the time that the first enslaved Africans touched down on the soil that would become the United States of America, the majority of Black people have existed in the southern region of the country, Even today, even though the majority is only a slight majority, it's still where they exist,\" Blow told the Guardian in an interview. \"There is a lot of sweat and blood equity put into building the infrastructure that became the American south. I would love to see Black people engage in reclaiming the benefits of the work that their ancestors did.\"\n\nBlow, who himself moved to Atlanta after two decades in New York, makes clear throughout the documentary that he's not seeking to create a Black utopia. \"There are no Wakandas,\" he said. The simple basis of his proposal is that Black people should have more say over how they are governed. While several large cities with a majority-Black population in the south have made progress in creating places where Black people can thrive and feel safe, they are hampered by the chokehold white conservatives have on the rest of the region. Take for example, the water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi, that left hundreds of thousands of people without clean drinking water - a crisis that came about after years of neglect from the majority white state legislature. \"If Jackson had had a state government in Mississippi that was actually responsive to Black people rather than hostile to Black people, you never would have had a crisis of this magnitude,\" Blow said in the documentary.\n\nBlow's proposal has precedent. In the 1970s, a group of students at Yale Law School came up with the idea of taking over a state. This spread further with a writer at Playboy suggesting Vermont, a conservative stronghold, as testing ground. By 1980, Vermont's population increased by 65,000, the largest population increase since the days following the American revolutionary war - and with the population growth came a change in politics. \"They changed one of the most conservative states into one of the most liberal states in America, the state where Barack Obama wins his highest percentage of the white vote in 2008,\" Blow said.\n\nBlow dismissed the northern bias that racism is worse in the south. Its history may be fraught when it comes to anti-Black discrimination, but Black people have experienced racial violence everywhere in the country, not just the south. He made the point that many of the cities where Black men were killed by people were destination cities for many Black individuals in the first great migration out of the south. \"Racism is not regional,\" Blow said.\n\nAnd by returning to the south, Black Americans are given a chance to regain a sense of ancestral belonging that they had to leave behind when they fled all those years ago.\n\n\"The vast majority of Black people existed for so long in the American south that our culture is part of American southern culture,\" Blow said. \"Southern food is primarily Black and enslaved people's food. The music is heavily influenced by Black people. When I am here, I pick up all of the sensory things that feel so familiar because it belongs to me. There is a sense of belonging that may not be tangible and articulated articulable, but that you feel because it's you.\"\n\nBlow gets personal in the documentary, returning to his family home in rural Louisiana and meeting with his cousins, who had never moved out of the south. A conversation with his family highlighted one of the challenges of Blow's proposal - the perceived notion of an opportunity. \"If you work at the mill, then your son automatically works there,\" one cousin said. \"It's hard to get out of those confines.\" Blow himself acknowledged that he left the south for more. Later on, in a conversation with colleagues at the New York Times, Dean Baquet, his former boss, pointed out that he himself would never have become executive editor had he not left New Orleans.\n\nBut opportunity does exist in the south, particularly for Black people, Blow said. In 2018, Forbes compiled a list of cities where Black people are doing the best economically, and a number of southern cities make that list. Blow emphasized that he is not asking people to forego career growth or success that many find in larger cities in the north and west. \"I always say to people if you're thriving and your work is thriving and you feel safe, you feel like your family is safe ... you may have already found your community,\" Blow said.\n\n\"But there's just a lot of people for whom that is not true,\" Blow continued. \"They cannot afford to buy, their schools are subpar. They feel under threat from the legal system and the policing system. They feel stuck in a cycle of hopelessness. There are a lot of people and I say to those people, you don't have to do that.\" He's asking that people be deliberate when seeking out opportunities - that when weighing where to settle down, to consider the opportunities.\n\n\"There are some things in life that are bigger than you,\" Blow said. \"Sometimes when you're deciding how you're going to live your life and the choices that you're going to make, it has to be about community success.\"\n\nSouth to Black Power will air on HBO on 28 November with a UK date to be announced"

Roughly four in 10 surveyed said that the media not only stereotyped Black people but also felt that they saw racist and racially insensitive coverage sometimes or fairly often.\n\nThe center's findings reflect the shortfalls of a so-called racial reckoning that swept through newsrooms across the United States in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd , when news outlets focused on hiring for roles centering diversity and inclusion and reporters and editors focused on covering communities traditionally underrepresented in news coverage.\n\nThe latest survey indicates that the so-called reckoning inside newsrooms has struggled to reach the communities that they are meant to serve, including as the news business continues to experience layoffs , and failed to change the way communities feel about the coverage they receive.\n\nCharles Whitaker, dean of the Northwestern University's Medill school of journalism told the Associated Press he was unsurprised by the findings.\n\nHe echoed the lack of nuance in coverage as a longstanding feeling among Black Americans who feel they are often portrayed as either victims of crimes or those who commit them. \"We've known both anecdotally, and through my personal experience with the Black press, that Blacks have long been dissatisfied with their coverage,\" he said.\n\nThe center surveyed nearly 5,000 adults over the winter to get their opinion on how Black Americans felt about how their communities are covered in the news media. The feelings of unfair coverage cut across political lines with Black Democrats and Republicans feeling very similar about how news coverage stereotyped Black communities.\n\nMore than two-thirds of Black adults surveyed noted that educating journalists about the history and context surrounding the issues facing their communities played a vital role in helping to improve coverage.\n\nWhat's more, a majority of Black Americans also noted that including more Black people as sources in news coverage would also heighten feelings of fairness in coverage for them. A majority also found that hiring more Black people in leadership positions helped to make news coverage about their communities more fair.\n\nAt least four in 10 people surveyed also found that hiring more Black reporters would make such coverage more fair. What's more, they saw it was crucial that race and racial inequity coverage came from Black reporters, though just over half said it mattered as much for overall news coverage.\n\nSign up to First Thing\n\nOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what's happening and why it matters\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nRichard Prince, a columnist for the Journal-isms newsletter, told the Associated Press that the findings reinforced the idea that Black Americans, like other groups, \"want to be portrayed as having the same concerns as everybody else. Still, he acknowledged that progress had been made in the upper echelons of newsrooms at a time when the industry experiences layoffs, adding: \"We're integrating an industry that's shrinking.\"\n\nFew of those surveyed, no matter the age, say they were confident that their communities will be covered fairly over the course of their lifetimes."

      "text": "Black Americans are not a monolithic group so stop treating us like one\n\nAmerica's black population includes many differences based on geography, gender and a host of other factors\n\nD onald Trump's 2020 State of the Union speech featured a series of cameo appearances by black Americans. Similar to his Super Bowl ad , Trump aimed to signal to black people that he cares about education and addiction in inner cities, the military service of black Americans and the plight of returning citizens trying to find work in an economy that is not kind to black people or ex-felons . Despite some people framing Trump's address as a black exploitation film, particularly by giving out a scholarship to a black child in Philadelphia who already attends a high-quality charter school, awarding the Medal of Freedom to Rush Limbaugh, and not acknowledging the cancer diagnosis of the civil rights icon and congressman John Lewis, Trump attempted to do what political pundits and voting polls often do not - treat black people as the heterogeneous group that they are who have different experiences and care about a series of important policy issues.\n\nAs I've written before , black Americans vote on par or higher than their state population. They represent a significant share of Democratic voters, especially in states like South Carolina (nearly 60%). Despite representing this large voting bloc, polls such as Quinnipiac continue to frame black Americans as a monolithic group, while disaggregating white people by age, political identification and education.\n\nI argue it is important to see the heterogeneity of black Americans. Others agree. Professor Eddie Glaude Jr said: \"We have to be more nuanced in how we talk about black voters. I would love to see the breakdown of the Q poll. Age. Class. Etc.\" Rolling Stone writer Jamil Smith said, \"I've examined the newest Quinnipiac poll very thoroughly ... and unfortunately, it does not break down black voters by age, class, education, or even gender. Just 'Black.' White respondents receive more nuanced treatment in the poll.\" This is puzzling considering black people (84%) report being just as likely as white people to pay a lot or some attention to the 2020 election.\n\nThough black Americans represent only 13.4% of the population, the more than 40 million of us represent a diverse array of backgrounds and political attitudes. Our votes will be on full display in South Carolina and on Super Tuesday in states with high black populations such as Alabama, Arkansas, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and California (particularly in Oakland and the southern part of the state).\n\nSo, what are the key demographic factors that should be focused on when addressing black American voters?\n\nFirst, black Americans comprise many ethnicities and ancestral nationalities. Immigrants represent roughly 10% of black people in the US and a substantial percentage of Latinos identify as black. Second, geography matters. Similar to the end of slavery and Jim Crow, black people are concentrated most in the south , mid-Atlantic and select cities such as Chicago, Detroit and New York City.\n\nThird, gender is different for blacks than the general population. There are nearly 5% more black women relative to black men, while women outnumber men by about 1.6% generally. Fourth, education matters and intersects with gender. About 25% of black women who are 25 years of age or older have a graduate or bachelor's degree (compared with only 18% of black men). There are important educational differences among cities as well. While over 30% of black Americans in some cities have a bachelor's degree or higher (Washington DC, Austin, Raleigh, Durham and San Francisco), other cities have black populations where less than 20% are college-educated (Milwaukee, Cleveland, Las Vegas, Charleston, St Louis and Detroit).\n\nThese differences among black Americans manifest within and across cities. The most affluent black metropolitan areas, Washington DC and Atlanta, feature some of the highest forms of income inequality . Furthermore, black people are least concentrated in the highest-growth geographies. Cities like Baltimore, Detroit and St Louis are expected to continue losing jobs. It should be no surprise that these cities were part of the Great Migration north as black people searched for better work opportunities outside of the south and fled the potential of lynching. Hampered by race riots and redlining, these cities have struggled to attract commerce. As some of the largest state employers, universities in these areas need to continue to provide opportunities for the communities they have historically neglected and used as research guinea pigs. But, all of these areas have historically black colleges that should receive the same investments as the predominantly white universities down the street.\n\nAdditionally, racial composition of neighborhoods within cities plays a role in the voting attitudes of black Americans. Black support for Trump increases as the black population of a neighborhood decreases. Though some of it may be about choice related to views about religiosity, abortion and smaller government, it is often about political attitudes being influenced by the conversations that people have daily, the news channel that is on at work or the gym, and the prominent role that geography plays in social media algorithms . Trump understands the role that social media played in the 2016 election so he isn't just signaling to whites in suburbia, he is also signaling to blacks.\n\nTrump also touts low unemployment for blacks. However, unemployment reversed and decreased most dramatically under President Obama. Nonetheless, black Americans are mostly concentrated in low-wage jobs that have poor benefits. Black people represent roughly 16% of laborers and food service and janitorial staff. College-educated blacks have the most college debt of any racial group. This is why Trump rolling back policies that reduce students' ability to receive subsidized loans is important to black people.\n\nDespite black Americans having some of the biggest increases in business ownership , they are unable to access economic and social capital to thrive and create jobs. This is why investment in black small businesses is so key for federal, state and local policymakers. Black Americans have the ideas, work ethic and resiliency to make businesses successful. What they need are the same investments and access to capital that white small businesses receive.\n\nConcerns about the racial wealth gap are deeply embedded in the Quinnipiac Poll. Blacks (62%) more than any other voting group are most likely to report wanting a candidate that shares their views versus being most electable (31%). More than any other voting group, blacks (63%) are most likely to report that the economy is poor or not so good, most likely to report being dissatisfied (44%) with the way things are going for them financially, and most likely to report being financially worse off (41%) than in 2016.\n\nIn discussions with family members, friends, fraternity members, colleagues and fellow church members, they all have a variety of concerns. Black Americans' linked fate often mutes our ability to selfishly only think about ourselves. However, whether blacks are more community-oriented or individually-oriented may dictate their political attitudes. Black Americans are not only concerned with criminal justice reform and voter disenfranchisement, they are worried about some blacks deciding not to vote because they don't have a candidate who speaks to their economic concerns, as I've written about before.\n\nSo maybe instead of engaging in identity politics, church pop-ups and offbeat dances, political candidates should focus on speaking to the real policy concerns of all Black Americans instead of a so-called ideal type. I definitely know that handing out cash to black people who want equitable education, high-quality jobs with healthcare benefits, and neighborhood infrastructure won't work. But, if you are going to view blacks as a monolith, then deal with the Goliath that links us - structural racism.\n\nRashawn Ray is a David M Rubenstein fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution , an associate professor of sociology at the University of Maryland, and executive director of the Lab for Applied Social Science Research"

      "text": "'It feels like home': why are Black Americans moving to Costa Rica?\n\nThe Caribbean coast of Central America's safest and most stable country offers Black expats a life that is less stressful, more affordable, and free from the burdens of everyday racism\n\nThe Guardian's journalism is independent.

Learn more.\n\nW hen she first set foot in Costa Rica , Davia Shannon knew instantly that she would eventually return permanently. She loved being able to do yoga with the jungle as her backdrop and surf whenever she pleased. Even more, she valued the sense of freedom she gained. Free of the fear, anxiety and pain driven by not feeling accepted in the US, Shannon had found her future home.\n\nThe Guardian's journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more.\n\nUpon arriving back in California after her 10-day visit, Shannon, now 46, developed a one-year exit plan which consisted of renting out her house, selling her car, rehoming her furniture and downsizing to 12 suitcases.\n\nIn March 2016, Davia Shannon packed up her belongings and left her lifelong home in Los Angeles to move 3,500 miles away with her twin daughters.\n\nThe adjustment wasn't simple. Shannon, who comes from a large family, was hoping to recreate the same communal atmosphere in Puerto Viejo, with people who understood her struggles and came from a similar lifestyle, but admits that settling in was challenging. \"I couldn't find anybody that looked like me and when I did, I felt like I couldn't really connect with them,\" she says.\n\nEven the Caribbean women proved difficult to get close to, and Shannon says they rarely showed her kindness. \"I was even having a really difficult time getting information and doing the basic things, like figuring out where to pay my light bill,\" she says. Most of the Caribbean people in the area speak English and Shannon is fluent in Spanish, so a cultural barrier played a greater role than language.\n\nLearning from her struggles, Shannon decided to open a relocation business, Life-A-Holic Costa Rica , to assist other Black American expats moving to the country. Since launching in 2017, the business has assisted 176 Black and brown people with their desire to relocate to the south Caribbean coast of Costa Rica. The relocation company also offers membership into a support group, referred to as the Tribe. Shannon describes the group as a ready-made family that helps expats comfortably transition to life in Puerto Viejo. A directory, numerous resources and social events like Soul Food Sundays, karaoke nights, family dinners and birthday celebrations, are just a few offerings provided in the Tribe.\n\nShannon decided to extend her services to Black and brown folks for two reasons: most information about relocation was geared towards white people and most of what she read about Costa Rica online was negative and untrue. \"I know the reason the negative information was perpetuated was because a vast majority of the people here have brown skin, and for some, that's too scary to explore,\" she says. \"That's fine, because my service is geared toward people who want to live in peace and harmony with people of the African diaspora.\" She also notes that moving to another country can be difficult for people who started traveling later in life. Because Black Americans have less disposable income , and therefore less free time to travel during their youth, the transition to living in another country as an adult is not always smooth.\n\nThink pieces and travel vlogs showcase that Black Americans move to Costa Rica for various reasons, but most say they are looking for an improved lifestyle. \"The main thing my clients want to do is get off the hamster wheel. They want to stop having to work 80-hour weeks. They want to come buy some land, build a home and use that as a base to create,\" says Shannon, who has bought three properties since moving to Costa Rica five years ago.\n\nAlthough she had a high-paying job in Los Angeles, Shannon couldn't accumulate enough wealth to pass down. \"I felt if I was to continue living in California with this lifestyle, then I wouldn't be able to leave anything to my kids. I didn't want them to have to repeat what I was doing, which was working really hard, working weekends and always being in hustle mode,\" Shannon says. She worked as a district manager for a leading human capital management company, but now she earns a livable income through her relocation company and renting out property on Airbnb.\n\nIn the United States, generational wealth is mostly obtained through property inheritance, career advancement or owning stocks. But Black people in America are the least likely group to own a home. And given that Black women in America make only 63% of what white men are paid, are the highest unemployed group among women, and are less likely to receive promotions , generational wealth is an unattainable feat for many. But in Puerto Viejo, where the average waterfront house costs roughly $100,000 , owning a home or land is a more achievable goal.\n\nSequoia Carr, a 37-year-old freelance writer and editor, is shopping for land in Costa Rica with plans to build a house. She had never seen the value in paying the exorbitant prices of homes in the US - and farmland has always been her focus.\n\nAfter living in New York and Los Angeles for most of her life, Carr found herself planting roots in Puerto Viejo at the height of the pandemic, in March 2020. Originally, Carr planned to visit the country for three months, but two weeks after she arrived, the borders were closed to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Her vacation morphed into a permanent move.\n\n\"I've traveled all throughout the world and this was the only place that I actually felt like it was a privilege to be Black. Not just welcomed, but people were happy that I was here, not just as a foreigner, but as someone who is Black,\" she says. \"In turn, this place felt like home.\"\n\nSafety also played into her decision to stay. \"The very apparent racism and political uprisings made me feel as though it just isn't safe to be in the United States as a Black person any longer,\" Carr says, noting that her ability to work remotely made it easier for her to leave. \"I get to wake up in a place where I feel less stress, less anxiety. It feels like home, I feel welcomed and I have all the things that I need to make me happy.\"\n\nThe belief that America is not a safe place for Black people is shared among many expats seeking a more promising life in countries that are more accepting of diversity. In fact, according to Amali Tower, the founder and executive director of Climate Refugees, the oppression Black people in the US face is so severe that if Black Americans were to seek asylum in another country , they would qualify.\n\nCosta Rica, which is ranked the most peaceful country in Central America, is one of the most politically stable countries in the world and experiences acts of gun violence nine times less frequently than the US. \"In LA I would never allow my children out of the house without me, but here they can ride their bikes wherever they want and come and go as they please. They go to the beach, they walk the dogs, they surf, they're happy and they're safe,\" says Shannon.\n\nJanna Zinzi describes her life in Costa Rica as safe and stress-free as well. The 41-year-old travel writer made the decision to leave New Orleans during a three-month stay in Costa Rica after watching the US Capitol attack on 6 January on television. \"I saw what was going on in the States and I booked an extra three months. After seeing that foolishness, I really had no desire to come back to America,\" she says. (The same fears resulted in a spike in consultations for Shannon's business - averaging five to 10 consultations a day for a month after the riot.)\n\nZinzi met Shannon through friends soon after moving to Puerto Viejo, speaking to the close-knit atmosphere in the Black expat community. She is now in Florida to renew her travel visa, sell her car and get her belongings out of storage before making her move permanent. Just being back in the US since June has reminded Zinzi why she left.\n\n\"Every time I leave [Costa Rica] for longer than a week, I can almost feel the stress, the tension, the rage, the trauma and the anger. Especially in Black folks and communities of color,\" she says. \"I know my mental health and my physical health is a lot better when I'm outside of the United States.\"\n\nHer worries surrounding police brutality, mass shootings and constant exposure to microaggressions do not exist in Costa Rica. \"I feel more relaxed, I feel freer because there's things that you don't have to think about there that you think about in the States.\"\n\nDespite the welcoming culture and feeling of belonging, being a Black American woman in Costa Rica does have some downsides, expats say, but none too large to handle. Natural hair salons are not easy to come by, ethnic hair products at the supermarket are scarce, and dating can be challenging if you're seeking out a Black partner with a favorable economic standing , due to a limited economy as well as racial exclusion in employment opportunities.\n\nBecause of Costa Rica's suffering economy and strict work visa policy, the majority of Shannon's expat clients are freelancers, work remotely or are retired. Many of them speak Spanish on an intermediate level, but fluency in the language is not at all necessary to get around. Nevertheless, the minor setbacks do not outweigh the pros of living in a safe environment where your existence is humanized.\n\nAs Carr said: \"There's a lack of convenience here, but the beauty of it is that I get access to the ocean and the mountains, and a different quality of life.\""

      "text": "The racist 1890 law that's still blocking thousands of Black Americans from voting\n\nRevealed: Fewer than 200 of those affected have been able to regain their voting rights in the last quarter-century\n\nThe Mississippi officials met in the heat of summer with a singular goal in mind: stopping Black people from voting.\n\n\"We came here to exclude the Negro,\" said the convention's president. \"Nothing short of this will answer.\"\n\nThis conclave took place in 1890. But remarkably, approximately 130 years later, the laws they came up with are still blocking nearly 16% of Mississippi's Black voting-age population from casting a ballot.\n\nThe US stands alone as one of the few advanced countries that allow people convicted of felonies to be blocked from voting after they leave prison. The policy in Mississippi underscores how these laws, rooted in the explicit racism of the Jim Crow south, continue to have discriminatory consequences today.\n\nOne of those affected is Roy Harness, a 67-year-old social worker, who may never be able to vote because of a crime committed decades ago.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, he was convicted of forgery after he ran up a debt to a drug dealer and cashed a series of fake checks. He spent nearly two years in prison and hasn't been back since.\n\nIn recent years, Harness, who is also an army veteran, has been on a new path. He enrolled in college when he was 55 and got his bachelor's degree when he was 63. He got a master's degree in 2019. Now a full-time social worker, Harness keeps a shelf behind his desk filled with awards and accomplishments - a reminder to his clients of all they can accomplish.\n\nIn 2013, he tried to register during a voter registration drive at his college, but saw on a pamphlet that forgery, the crime he had been convicted of decades earlier, was a disenfranchising crime in Mississippi.\n\n\"It makes me feel bad. I've served my country, nation ... got a degree and [I] still can't vote, no matter what you do to prove yourself,\" he said.\n\nMississippi also makes it nearly impossible for anyone convicted of a felony to get their voting rights back. Fewer than 200 people have succeeded in restoring their voting rights in the last quarter-century, the Guardian can reveal, based on newly obtained data .\n\nNow, Harness is involved in a new effort to change Mississippi's law.\n\nA fter slavery ended in Mississippi, following the US civil war, newly enfranchised Black voters in the state were beginning to wield political power. In 1870, Mississippi sent Hiram Revels to the US Senate, the first Black person to serve in the body.\n\nBy 1890, the delegates who gathered for a constitutional convention in Jackson, the state capital, were determined to blunt this trend.\n\nThey faced a significant roadblock to their racist goal. The new 15th amendment to the US constitution explicitly prohibited states from preventing people from voting based on their race. And so the delegates came up with a plan that would effectively prevent Black people from voting without explicitly saying that was their intent.\n\nThe delegates enacted a poll tax and literacy tests, measures that would become widespread across the south, as a way of keeping people from voting. But they also enacted a provision that disqualified people convicted of specific felonies from voting. The crimes they picked were those they believed, based on prejudices, Black people were more likely to commit. Bribery, burglary, theft, arson, bigamy and embezzlement were among the crimes that would cause someone to lose their voting rights. Robbery and murder were not. Mississippi continues to see the legacy of its efforts to shut Black voters out of the political process today. It has one of the highest concentrations of Black people in the country, yet has not elected a Black person to statewide office in well over a century. It was among the states with the lowest voter turnout in the US in 2020.\n\nEven though Black Mississippians comprise about one-third of eligible voters in the state, they account for more than half of the 235,152 people who can't vote in the state because of a felony conviction, according to an estimate by the Sentencing Project, a criminal justice non-profit. Overall, more than one in 10 citizens of voting age can't cast a ballot in Mississippi because of a felony conviction - the highest rate of disfranchisement in the US.\n\nAnd it is astonishingly difficult for those affected to get their right to vote restored.\n\nTo vote again, people with disqualifying felonies in Mississippi must first convince a lawmaker to introduce a bill in the legislature on their behalf to restore their voting rights. In other words, they need their own, individualized piece of law.\n\nThe bill must then pass both chambers of the legislature by two-thirds vote and be approved by the governor. Mississippi is the only state in the country where people convicted of felonies need to go through the legislature to get their voting rights back, said Christopher Uggen, a professor at the University of Minnesota who studies felon disfranchisement.\n\nThe only other path to get one's voting rights back is a gubernatorial pardon, which hasn't been granted in Mississippi in nearly a decade.\n\nThe process is the same one the delegates spelled out during the 1890 racist constitutional convention, where the felony disqualification rule was created. It was included as a safeguard to ensure that well-connected white Mississippians who committed one of the disenfranchising crimes had a way of gaining their voting rights back.\n\nMississippi does not keep track of how many people successfully get their voting rights restored each year. But data compiled by Blake Feldman, a criminal justice researcher in Mississippi, shows it's almost no one. Feldman began tallying the data in 2018 for the Southern Poverty Law Center, and has continued to track it since.\n\nSince 1997, an average of about seven people have been successful each year. In the 2021 legislative session, just two people made it through the process.\n\nThere are no posted instructions anywhere online, said Hannah Williams, a research and policy analyst at MS Votes, a non-profit that works to expand voter access. Applicants must submit a paper form - there is no online option - to their lawmaker and convince them to vouch for them. After that, their fate is in the hands of lawmakers, who can reject an application for any reason.\n\n\"There really isn't a way to guarantee anything because the process doesn't really make sense. There's no information. You can't go to a website. And to be honest, you can't even call the capitol to get information, because they don't really know what the process is,\" she said.\n\n\"Unless you know somebody that knows somebody that knows somebody who has their ear to the floor, you don't know when you have to turn these applications in,\" she added.\n\nNick Bain, a Republican who chairs the Mississippi House judiciary committee, which oversees the bills for rights restoration, acknowledged the process was \"convoluted\". Both chambers can set whatever criteria they want people to meet before they restore someone's voting rights. Those criteria, which are not posted publicly, do not have to agree.\n\n\"I do believe it's patently unfair the way that we do the process. And maybe as a Republican, that may not be the Republican thinking on that,\" he said. \"We have a problem with consistency. The process, it's by no means perfect. By no means is it efficient ... But right now it's the only process that we have.\"\n\nW hile the law today continues to disproportionately affect African Americans, white Mississippians are affected too. Dennis Hopkins, a 46-year-old maintenance supervisor from Potts Camp, Mississippi, was convicted of grand larceny as a teenager in the 1990s, released from prison in 2001, and hasn't been able to vote since. Because he was convicted of a felony when he was a teenager, he's never been able to vote in his life.\n\nEven though he has raised nine children (he's adopted several), become a local fire chief, and coached many school sports teams with hundreds of kids, he can't vote.\n\n\"I'm thinking 'you sentenced me to four years in prison and you're giving me a life sentence,'\" he said. \"I feel like I'm a branded man and I'm not equal to everybody else.\"\n\nHarness and Hopkins are now the lead plaintiffs in two separate high-stakes federal lawsuits challenging Mississippi's felon disfranchisement laws.\n\nOne suit argues that the list of original disqualifying crimes unconstitutionally targeted Black people and therefore should be struck down. The second, filed by the Southern Poverty Law Center in 2018 , also challenges the Mississippi policy and takes aim at the arcane restoration process.\n\n\"The process is fundamentally arbitrary and inherently susceptible to discrimination,\" lawyers wrote. \"There is no oversight of any kind to ensure that legislators do not exercise their discretion to vote against a proposed suffrage bill on the basis of an individual's race, religion, or political leanings.\"\n\nEven though the core of Mississippi's policy remains what was drafted during the 1890 convention, lawyers for the state have argued its discriminatory taint has been removed. There have been small tweaks to the law; voters chose to remove burglary disenfranchising crime in 1950 and added murder and rape in 1968.\n\nIn February, the US court of appeals for the 5th circuit upheld Mississippi's policy , writing that 20th-century tweaks to the law removed the discrimination written into it in 1890. But the court later agreed to rehear the case, and there were oral arguments in September. A decision is expected in the coming months.\n\nIn late October, both Harness and Hopkins traveled to the state capitol and appeared before a panel of lawmakers. They were there for a hearing convened by Bain, who wanted to explore new ways to fix the process for getting voting rights back.\n\nAt the end of the hearing, one of the lawmakers approached Hopkins and offered to file a rights restoration bill on his behalf. Hopkins was unaware the process was even a possibility - he had been told there was no way for him to get his voting rights back. Still, he refused.\n\n\"That's not gonna help everyone else. I told them no - I'd prefer not to do that,\" he said.\n\n\"I tell my kids how important the vote is ... it shames me to tell them I can't vote and here is why,\" he said. \"I know there's a lot of people who say, \"my vote doesn't count. Well I beg to differ. It does count.\""

      "text": "How Black Americans have been cheated out of land ownership - and the movement to reverse this\n\nNew book examines history of US land theft and why Black citizens' futures should include restorative justice\n\nA merica's original superpower is the land itself - a sprawling patchwork of green pastures, potable waterways and seasons that are never entirely overripe. It's no wonder white colonizers grabbed as much of this prime real estate as they could, disregarding the prevailing masses who well knew, from centuries of subsisting off the land, that it ultimately belongs to no one.\n\nAfter the purges of war and slavery, Black Americans emerged with about 15m acres (6m hectares) of land in their possession. The current holdings figure stands at about 2m acres, less than 0.5% of US land, and the grip is slipping fast. \"From the very moment Europeans touch this soil,\" explains author Brea Baker, \"it was all about extraction.\"\n\nBaker's debut tome, Rooted: The American Legacy of Land Theft and the Modern Movement for Black Ownership, plows deep into a devastating history that spans from settler colonialism to modern-day redlining. Released on Juneteenth, the US federal holiday that honors the captive workers who were last to find out slavery in America had ended, Rooted is a deeply personal story, born from Baker's years of writing on Black and queer culture and from her passionate activism on the social justice frontlines. An Atlantan by way of New York, Baker cherishes the opportunities to dirty her hands after avoiding them for years. A backyard chicken coop is one point of pride. She was driven to explore her southern roots after her paternal grandfather - a working-class engineer, who, like her, returned to the south after being raised up north - consolidated the family's heirs' properties into an 86-acre estate: Bakers Acres.\n\nThis was no mean feat for a Black man in North Carolina, infamous for its violent practice of terrorizing Black communities into conditional citizenship . Many of those people descended from displaced Indigenous communities like the Maroons - the Black freedmen who banded together to form their own societies as protection against recapture. Assimilation was not a survival option. In Rooted, Baker recalls how the Five Civilized Tribes entered into the slave trade to prevail on colonizers their value as partner-neighbors. Only too late, Baker writes, do they realize \"that the only limit to American westward expansion would be the Pacific Ocean\". The line leaves you reconsidering whether a popular expression like \"Give an inch, and they'll take a mile\" is literally innocuous .\n\nBy centering Black people in the story of the great American land grab, Rooted makes manifest destiny look like the lid on Pandora's box; the book makes clear this unquenchable thirst for expansion runs from chattel slavery to the Industrial Revolution and still has the country licking its lips as it lurches into late-stage capitalism. \"It required so much destruction,\" Baker says of manifest destiny. \"Killing Black people who could not bear the burden of the level of work. Killing the land, stripping it deeply and then denying all of the ancestral wisdom that both Black and indigenous people were bringing to the table.\n\n\"They would say, 'We've got to do crop rotations. We've got to do controlled burns.' But the answer was always , 'We need more. We just have to try hard enough to make it happen faster.'\"\n\nEven as it teems with decades of policy and sociological research, Rooted unfolds like a yarn passed down through the generations. Baker pulls off the trick of remaining an authoritative narrator while holding onto the same sense of wonder that thickened the air during her formative trips down south. But it wasn't easy getting relatives and others who've seen family land come and go, whether through domestic terrorism or the tax code , to open up. \"A lot of our elders don't want to talk about their relationship to land because it's painful,\" she says. \"A lot of them grew up in a Jim Crow society where to be an imperfect Black person was to be a picked-off Black person. So you don't admit to faults very easily, and you don't linger on trauma long because what's that gonna fix? Is it gonna bring the land back?\"\n\nTo read Baker's lush and lyric descriptions of land, lives and opportunities lost is to be reminded of the TV series Queen Sugar - the Ava DuVernay -created, Oprah Winfrey -produced cable drama about a trio of Black Louisiana siblings struggling to hold on to their 800-acre sugar farm in the wake of their father's surprise death. \"It's so funny because my childhood best friend is Nick Ashe. He played Micah on the show,\" says Baker, recalling Ashe's astonished reaction to her early chapter drafts. \"He was like: 'I thought [the show scripts] were all just a lot of dramatization. But this is exactly how it happened - and is still going on.'\"\n\nWhereas in Queen Sugar, Black landowners mostly found themselves pitted against wealthier whites, in real life it was federal agencies like the US Department of Agriculture - which Abraham Lincoln established in the middle of the American civil war to safeguard the nation's agrarian economy - that was the true antagonist. \"The explicit violence comes in when the USDA's research tells them farmers need all these chemicals, pesticides and super-expensive machines that wind up putting most small farms, not just the Black ones, out of business,\" Baker says.\n\nThat, Baker argues, opened the door to industrial farming and paved the way for companies like Tyson - the chicken giant recently revealed to have dumped millions of pounds of toxic pollutants into US rivers and lakes - to achieve farmland monopolies. What's more, Rooted shows, the USDA was often the party helping these companies to swindle land out from under Black farmers in the name of the free market. \"Most people, when they think of federal agencies, it's white ivory buildings in DC filled with people appointed by the president, who then lead policy,\" Baker says. \"But the USDA is a bunch of local offices in states across the country with officers that have carte blanche to implement and execute federal policy on a county level. So that means when the USDA says we have loans and we're going to disseminate them, this one USDA county officer is who you go through. And it's wild because the USDA, on their own website, has their own reports that confirm just how racist their county agents were.\"\n\nIn the end, Rooted argues for the rural land activism of the south (quiet as it's kept to prevent more terrorism) to be as recognized and respected as mainstream (read: northern) movements against systemic inequalities, while also making the case that land shouldn't be left out of Black Americans' reparations demands. (Not only did the federal government renege on the 40 acres and a mule Lincoln had promised to emancipated people, it repossessed the few land parcels that had been officially granted to freed Black Americans and gave it to white southerners .) With every braggadocious social media post, Rick Ross , Waka Flocka and other Black celebrities drive home the idea that a person isn't truly free in America until there's a strip of land they can call their own.\n\nA recent Reuters/Ipsos survey found that 74% of Black Americans were in favor of reparations. But Baker argues that it's whites - who are 74% against - who will need to be swayed for there to be any real chance of restorative justice.\n\n\"Book bans and attacks on critical race theory are only going to make that harder,\" she says. \"Because now you have to opt in to a book like Rooted. You don't get to have this conversation in a classroom. So for those who are seeing the book and are engaged, there's now a responsibility to do more than just the bare minimum. You gotta talk to your nana about why she has a ranch in Montana that the Indigenous nations can't access. You've got to wonder why Jackson Hole, Wyoming, doesn't have any listings for under $1m, but Indigenous people can't fish in the national parks there.

      "text": "In 1919, the state failed to protect black Americans. A century later, it's still failing\n\nThere is something so wounded in American society that basic commitment to justice is not part of the operating code\n\nI n 1919, as soldiers returned from the first world war, many white Americans saw African American men in military uniforms for the first time. That sight, and the challenge it posed to the political, social and economic order, was deeply threatening to them. Groups of armed white men hunted down and slaughtered hundreds of black Americans across the country. The wave of lynchings and race riots came to be known as the Red Summer .\n\nThe black community did its best to fight back, without protection from the state. In some cases, police actively participated in the lynchings. The US attorney general, A Mitchell Palmer, claimed that leftwing radicals were behind the uprisings - a false charge and one that further endangered African American lives. Palmer worked for President Woodrow Wilson, an ardent segregationist who screened Birth of a Nation in the White House and praised the Ku Klux Klan even as it deployed terrorism to keep blacks away from the voting booth. Wilson had been silent while whites slaughtered African Americans in East St Louis in 1917, and he did little to nothing in 1919 when they again attacked and killed black people, this time on an even more horrific and grisly scale.\n\nWhen African Americans fought back, when they protested, when they made clear they would not quietly accept the destruction of their lives, Palmer mobilized the power of the federal government to brand black unrest as the work of the enemy of the state - communists. It was his version of peace without justice. To do this he ignored the destructive and violent white supremacy that his president had helped unleash. He remained unconcerned about the bold, brazen killing of black people. And he had no qualms about a criminal justice system in which being black meant the presumption of guilt.\n\nMore than 100 years later, in the wake of the brutal, merciless killings of George Floyd , Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor - not to mention an incident in which a white woman attempted to put a black birdwatcher in the crosshairs of the NYPD - our current attorney general, Bill Barr, does not appear to see injustice. Instead, he sounds much like his ancient predecessor, A Mitchell Palmer.\n\nBarr, like Palmer, has largely ignored the continued killing of black people by vigilantes and agents of the state. He has also ignored the root causes of the current uprisings, such as the flat-out refusal of American institutions to address the violence and conditions that create a life where black people cannot breathe. Instead Barr has chosen to focus his attention on what he characterizes as rioting and \"domestic terrorism\". Mimicking Donald Trump , and without evidence, he has blamed the current eruption on \" far-left extremists , using antifa-like tactics, many of whom travel from out of state to promote the violence\", and he has warned that he will prosecute these (mostly phantom) anti-fascists. Barr previously said that if communities had the audacity to protest police brutality, they might \" find themselves without the police protection they need \".\n\nFor his part, Trump has branded the protesters \" thugs \" and threatened to have American citizens shot and \" vicious dogs \" unleashed on them. On Sunday he tweeted that antifa would be labeled a \" terrorist organization \".\n\nStrangely, Barr and Trump did not apply the same threat to the armed white men who stormed the Michigan capitol, challenged law enforcement and shut down the government during a pandemic. Trump defined these gun-toting white men as \" very good people \"..\n\nDespite all the smoke and mirrors and blustering threats, it's obvious what Trump's Department of Justice has done - or not done - that helped bring us to this horrific moment. It abandoned enforcing consent decrees with police departments that have a demonstrated history of brutality and discrimination. It refused to collect and monitor the data that would identify patterns and hotspots of bad policing so that safeguards could be put in place. Equally important, it didn't shore up the voting rights of American citizens, so they could elect representatives whose policies could protect their lives. Instead, the Department of Justice lent its heft to conservative forces, like in Alabama , who were determined to block African Americans from the ballot box even during a pandemic.\n\nAs in 1919, we are dealing with an America where black and brown people must go into the streets to demand their rights because the institutions of democracy have failed to protect them. In 2020, we have a nation where large swaths of the executive, legislative and judicial branches at the federal and state levels have virtually abandoned millions of American citizens.\n\nWhy, for instance, did two district attorneys in Georgia see the video of Ahmaud Arbery's lynching and decide that there was no wrongdoing, even though the film contradicted and undermined the admitted killers' statements? Why did it take the snuff film of George Floyd's death to raise the question of how an officer with 18 complaints against him could still be on the police force to squat with his knee on a man's neck for eight minutes? Why did Christian Cooper know that if he didn't film his accuser delivering a Broadway-worthy audition for the 911 dispatcher , his life would have been imperiled? Why after the \"no-knock\" warrant killings of Kathryn Johnston in Atlanta, Aiyana Stanley-Jones in Detroit and now Breonna Taylor in Louisville, did it take protests, mobilization, righteous anger and the media spotlight to even get an investigation?\n\nThere is something so wounded in American society, in American institutions, that basic decency, basic commitments to justice, are simply not part of the operating code. Justice should not require a spotlight. Justice should not require an uprising.\n\nOf course, the standard response to the uproar about police killing African Americans is the retort about black-on-black crime . That pre-packaged answer ignores that just as more than 80% of blacks are killed by blacks, so, too, are more than 80% of whites killed by whites . Yet we don't get angst or pathologizing about white-on-white crime. That's because the narrative about African Americans killing each other is not really motivated by concern about black life; it is a conjuror's trick to take our eyes off the institutionalized, state-sponsored violence that has rained down on black people.\n\nIn their intonations about antifa instigators and leftwing radicals, that's what Barr and Trump - like Palmer and Wilson before them - are doing: trying to distract us from state-sponsored or -condoned violence.\n\nOn the other hand, what blacks did in 1919 to deal with a political structure absolutely hostile to their very existence is exactly what we will and must do now. \"Plot, plan, strategize, organize, mobilize,\" as the rapper Killer Mike put it - and vote. That is how we get an attorney general appointed who is appalled at the desecration of Americans' basic rights and determined to end that unrequited violence. That is how we get policymakers, judges, senators, district attorneys, school boards, congressional and state representatives, mayors, city council members, governors, and yes, even a president, who know that #BlackLivesMatter.\n\nCarol Anderson is the Charles Howard Candler professor of African American Studies at Emory University and the author of White Rage: The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide"

      "text": "As A Black Man, Here's Why I've Decided To Leave America For Good\n\nGuest Writer\n\nAt 4 a.m. on Nov. 6, as my wife and I sat in our Seattle home watching election results roll in, something crystallized in our shared glance. We'd already been methodically planning our departure for months, recognizing America's trajectory. The weight of that moment ― the culmination of years of systematic observation and personal experience ― settled heavily in our bedroom. This wasn't just another exercise in hypothetical escape; this was the final push we needed to transform rhetoric into reality.\n\nGrowing up across the tracks in Richmond, Texas, I learned early about the complexities of being what my grandfather called a \"peculiar Negro.\" I was that kid who read \"X-Men\" comics, dated outside my race and spoke \"too proper,\" choices that got me labeled a \"sellout\" by age 15. Those early experiences of existing between worlds ― not Black enough for some spaces, too Black for others ― prepared me for a life of navigating complex racial dynamics, a skill that proved invaluable in my journey from a small Texas town to my current position as a diversity officer at a major research university in Seattle.\n\nThe decision to leave America isn't born from a single moment but from a lifetime of accumulated experiences. As a former infantry soldier who once believed wholeheartedly in the Army values of loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honor, integrity and personal courage, I've watched our nation repeatedly fail to live up to these ideals. A memory still echoes in my mind of a drill sergeant at Fort Benning, Georgia, singing racist cadences during PT runs.\n\nJust last year, while checking into a hotel in downtown Portland, an unhoused person's quick transition from asking for money to hurling racial slurs reminded me that no amount of education or professional achievement can fully shield us from America's deeply ingrained racism. It was a stark reminder that to some, I would always be, first and foremost, a \"nigger\" in America.\n\nBy mid-November, my wife and I had secured our positions in U.K. academic programs. Despite most universities having closed their admissions, my Ph.D. in industrial-organizational psychology and my wife's Health and Care Professions Council credentials opened doors. We opted for the student visa pathway, recognizing its flexibility in establishing our new foundation.\n\nThe logistics proved complex, particularly arranging international transport for our Scottish terrier, Rosco. As we navigate the Seattle housing market and liquidate assets, we're fortunate that current property values have provided sufficient resources to ensure our transition remains permanent. This capacity to choose our destiny reflects undeniable privilege ― options my grandfather could never have imagined when he first called me \"peculiar.\" We went from zero to London in less than two months.\n\nThe mounting opposition to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in American academia has been particularly telling, but equally concerning is the fundamental lack of infrastructure supporting this work. While my own department has been exceptionally supportive, the broader landscape of academic DEI reveals a troubling pattern. Unlike established academic disciplines that have clear theoretical foundations, dedicated journals and institutional homes, DEI work often exists in a precarious space ― valued in rhetoric but undernourished in practice.\n\nMy success in this field came from deliberately bridging industrial/organizational psychology with DEI principles, creating measurable outcomes and data-driven approaches to inclusion. This marriage of methodological rigor with equity work shouldn't be novel ― it should be standard practice. Yet across academia, DEI initiatives often lack this sort of foundation, leading to well-intentioned but ineffective programs that fail to create lasting change. You can see that in just how easily they were dismantled at George Mason University, Virginia Commonwealth University, the University of Wyoming and so on. Like so much trash, they were easily tossed aside.\n\nAs someone who has dedicated years to advancing diversity in higher education, I've watched with growing alarm as equity work faces systematic dismantling. The combination of external political pressure and internal institutional failures creates a perfect storm. When lawmakers craft policies designed to undermine civil rights protections and weaken anti-discrimination laws through initiatives like Project 2025, the writing on the wall becomes impossible to ignore: It's time to bounce.\n\nThe Pacific Northwest, despite its natural beauty and proclaimed progressiveness, has shown me the limitations of American liberalism. As a Black person in Seattle, I rarely see others who look like me in certain spaces, creating a peculiar kind of isolation. This hypervisibility in professional settings ― being simultaneously the most noticeable person in the room and the most overlooked ― creates a unique psychological burden that requires constant navigation of others' perceptions while maintaining one's sense of self.\n\nThis isn't about abandoning the struggle for racial justice. It's about recognizing that sometimes, survival requires finding new ground from which to stand and breathe. The legacy of slavery and its modern manifestations have created an America where even the air feels heavy with history's unresolved debts. Recent studies show that college graduates who are Black have lower wealth levels than high school dropouts who are white. The life expectancy for Black Americans is six years less than for their white counterparts. It all paints a clear picture of systemic inequities that no amount of individual achievement can overcome.\n\nWe're looking ahead to our departure date with both anticipation and solemnity. I'll be celebrating my birthday the following day in London, which symbolizes more than personal significance; it represents a conscious choice to define our future on different terms. We're not running away; we're running toward something better. The U.K. presents its own challenges with racism and inequality, but there's a fundamental distinction between choosing one's battles and inheriting them.\n\nFor those contemplating similar decisions: This process demands substantial financial resources, emotional resilience and psychological preparation. The practical challenges are considerable, from securing international positions to navigating visa requirements and managing the logistics of an overseas move. Yet for some of us, the cost of remaining has become untenable.\n\nAs a Black academic who has extensively studied systemic racism and trauma, I've concluded that self-preservation sometimes manifests as the conscious choice to flourish elsewhere. The psychological toll of navigating American racism ― the constant hypervigilance, the burden of representation, the exhausting dance between visibility and invisibility ― exacts a price too high to ignore.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "The Cultural Legacy Behind 'Blaxit' - And How It Informed Our Choice to Leave The U.S.\n\nOn Assignment For HuffPost\n\nMoving to a new country can stimulate personal development and emotional growth - especially for artists looking for creative inspiration. For Black Americans, however, this move can present a special set of challenges that stem from a long history of institutionalized racism, discrimination and oppression. We know, however, from the stories of our ancestors, that it can be worth it.\n\nIf living abroad is something you're considering as a Black creative, it's worth examining why some of our revered creatives up and left - and what it did for their spirits and their craft.\n\nDuring the pandemic, the term \"Blaxit\" began to infiltrate our feeds and group texts - it's a term that describes the sometimes-revolutionary act of Black Americans leaving their home countries to live, work, or study abroad. Blaxit is often seen as a response to the systemic racism, discrimination and lack of opportunities faced by Black people in their home countries. By leaving, many of us hope to find better economic and social conditions and escape the constant threat of racial violence.\n\nThe concept isn't new, of course. Black people have been leaving their home countries for centuries in search of a better life. During the 20th century, the Great Migration saw millions of Black people leave the rural South of the United States for cities in the North and West in search of better economic opportunities. And more recently, Black people from around the world have been moving to various places abroad, either to escape discrimination and racism in the U.S. or to take advantage of economic opportunities and simply a more fruitful quality of life.\n\nAs a Black American woman who has lived in Mexico, as well as countries in Asia, Europe and Africa, I have found that I share a great deal with many of my foremothers and forefathers who conceptualized and crafted some of their greatest works abroad. In 2015, when I moved to Egypt at the age of 28, I was amazed to find out that Dr. Maya Angelou had not only lived in Cairo many moons prior to my arrival but was an editor at a newspaper there. During my time there, I often sought to retrace steps she took both literally and in her writing career.\n\nSimilar to Angelou, many Black creatives found themselves creating and thriving abroad. To name a few: James Baldwin, Josephine Baker, Audre Lorde and Paul Robeson. I find that, similar to the experiences of my creative ancestors, living abroad allowed me to expand how I saw the world and related to other humans.\n\nI got my news directly from the sources. I learned languages. I sat and ate (a sacred act for so many cultures) with communities very different from mine. And as a result, I began writing about my journey as a way to resist the myth that Black excellence can only be measured by financial wealth or which fancy job you have. We're allowed to find joy in wandering by ourselves, collecting experiences and finding new parts of ourselves far away from home.\n\nJames Baldwin, for example, left the United States for France in 1948, as he describes it, to escape racial discrimination and gain a new perspective on the world. While there, he wrote several groundbreaking novels, essays and plays, including \" Notes of a Native Son\" and \" The Fire Next Time,\" both of which bravely explored race, sexuality and identity in America. His work challenged and inspired generations of writers and activists.\n\nTo be fair, Baldwin did find that France had its own form of racism - it's clear that anti-Blackness lives in every corner of the world. He wrote an essay in 1949 called \"Equal in Paris\" where he talks about being arrested for allegedly stealing a bedsheet and forced to sign Parisian documents of guilt without an attorney or contact with the U.S. Embassy. Still, it appears that escaping our specific brand of racism served many Black artists in certain ways.\n\nSome Black artists have left powerful footprints abroad as well. Audre Lorde, a poet and essayist, left the United States for Berlin in 1984, where she continued to write and speak out against oppression and discrimination. Her body of work challenged societal norms and celebrated the experiences of marginalized communities, including Black women, queer women and immigrants. Lorde's writings still resonate in Germany and Mexico, where she cultivated movements that have transcended both Afro-Mexican and Afro-German communities of women.\n\nJosephine Baker, a dancer and singer, left the United States for France in the 1920s, where she became a beloved performer and activist. She used her platform to challenge racial stereotypes and to fight for civil rights in both America and Europe. Although extraordinarily talented and beautiful, Baker didn't rest on those adjectives to blend in or vainly stand out, but to create a groundswell of support for movements that advocated for her people, at home and abroad.\n\nToday's Blaxit echoes the past but incorporates new desires as well. Nicole Brewer, an Oman-based Black American, built a teaching, writing and globe-trotting community in the footsteps of the skilled storytellers of the past. Originally from Detroit, Brewer left the United States during the 2008 recession. She figured, as a Black woman, she'd have more opportunities not only for work but also to grow into who she hopes to become - strong, fulfilled and culturally open-minded.\n\n\"I've been inspired by James Baldwin as a writer and expat,\" she said. \"He spoke so much truth to power. His quote, 'The most dangerous creation of any society is the man who has nothing to lose,' spoke volumes [to me,] a person who had nothing to lose by moving abroad and starting over after being laid off from my job in Chicago.\" Brewer has lived in Germany, South Korea, South Africa and Oman so far.\n\nIt's a tale as old as time: Black Americans exploring new possibilities because they feel depleted and exploited in the U.S., stuck emotionally or simply creatively. And just like Lorde did, we also tend to leave an enormous influence in other countries, sparking much-needed conversations about racism, sexism, misogyny and the miles-long list of oppressive systems that exist worldwide.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

I taught my students about Langston Hughes and Maya Angelou as well as the Haitian Revolution and the trans-Atlantic slave trade.

Sharing my stories and experiences (as Baker, Baldwin and all my other ancestral expats did), is a giant step toward dismantling mindsets.\n\nOur Blaxit pioneers' work, their joy, and their fight for racial and social justice paved the way for our freedom to explore. In my seven years abroad, I found that life makes room for whatever your journey to the best version of you looks like.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Credit: Meredith Edlow for HuffPost\n\nDevon Kitzo-Creed, a 28-year-old African American woman, always planned on leaving the United States to live abroad. Definitely before she had children, but probably not until she was in her 30s.\n\n2020 pushed up her timeline.\n\nNow she and her husband, who live in Wilmington, Delaware, are planning on relocating to Ecuador right after the election. She'll continue her work as a doula and childbirth educator. He can work remotely as a video editor and animator.\n\nWhy the rush? \" The way things have gone this year, the political climate of our country, and just the way that I do not feel valued at all in this country,\" Kitzo-Creed explained.\n\nThe day before Kitzo-Creed spoke to HuffPost, a Kentucky grand jury declined to indict police officers for murder after they shot and killed Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman, inside her Louisville, Kentucky, apartment.\n\nThat no one would face justice for the death of an innocent woman sent a familiar message to Kitzo-Creed: This country doesn't care about Black people.\n\n\"It's like the Black woman really is the most disrespected, disregarded person in America ,\" she said, echoing a Malcolm X quote made even more famous by Beyoncé. \"So, I'm leaving.\"\n\nKitzo-Creed is part of a group of African American professionals looking to leave, or who have already left, the United States. HuffPost spoke to several who said they were fed up with the daily drumbeat of racism, discrimination at work, the hostility of police officers, the fear of doing even the most mundane tasks.\n\nKitzo-Creed recalled how just this summer, she was getting followed around the grocery store. Another man recounted how a police car followed him at night just recently, sending his heart racing. A woman recalled asking a repairman at her home to put on a mask because of the pandemic. He told her, \"We won't need to do this after Trump wins the election.\"\n\nAlmost every Black professional HuffPost spoke with had a story about a tense encounter with the police. Several said that the killings of Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery (shot while jogging), and George Floyd (killed by a police officer who kept a knee on his neck for eight minutes) were crystallizing moments.\n\nWhile there is no hard data on the number of African Americans who live abroad or intend to move, anecdotally, discussions about whether to stick around in the U.S. are increasing - particularly among college-educated, relatively well-off Black Americans . USA Today and Condé Nast Traveler noted the trend in August . And after the presidential debate last month, Google saw an increase in searches for how to move to Canada.\n\nIt isn't just politics and police violence, though. Everyone talked about the pandemic. \"The shift really came this year with the pandemic,\" said Sienna Brown, a 28-year-old African American woman who moved to Spain six years ago and now runs an online community for women who are interested in moving abroad. She said that initially, she mostly heard from women looking to travel internationally. Now it's women who want to leave.\n\n\"This year was the final turning point for me. There's something about this country that feels like a weight on me.\"\n\nLife in the U.S. has always been far more deadly for Black people, who have a lower life expectancy and higher mortality rate . And COVID-19 brought that long-term trend into full relief. Death rates for Black people from the virus are disproportionately high.\n\nBut death rates for African Americans were already higher going into the pandemic. Incredibly, even if no one in the Black community had died from the coronavirus, their mortality rate would still be higher than for white Americans in the middle of the pandemic, demographer Elizabeth Wrigley-Field recently explained in Slate . \" Racism gave Black people pandemic-level mortality long before COVID ,\" she writes.\n\nEconomically, it's well-known that African Americans start out way behind white Americans. The pandemic amplified the issue. Right now, the Black unemployment rate is about twice that of white workers - a ratio that has held since the U.S. first started measuring the data.\n\nA few people mentioned that life abroad would be less expensive, enabling them to retire earlier or afford the kind of housing and lifestyle that is out of reach in the United States. And the need to quarantine has led to increased feelings of isolation and a lack of community.\n\nBut the desire to leave the U.S. is not simply about economic opportunity or even mortality rates; it is about a search for self. African Americans spoke of having to leave the U.S. to truly find themselves, free from the weight and stress of living with racism.\n\n\"For me, as a Black man, and I tell this to everybody I speak to, I feel more safe in other countries. Every other country I've been to, more than my own,\" said Terry Williams, a 32-year-old teacher who's lived abroad, traveling through 26 countries, since 2016. He's able to teach classes online. \"Being abroad is the first time I have felt some kind of privilege, if that makes sense. I'm not looked at as a Black person.\"\n\n\"Just between the racism and everything that happened as a result of the pandemic, I really don't want to be here anymore,\" a 45-year-old Black professional who lives in Washington, D.C. told HuffPost. She declined to be identified because her employer doesn't know yet.\n\n\"This year was the final turning point for me,\" she said. \"There's something about this country that feels like a weight on me.\"\n\nShe plans on moving to Cape Verde, an island nation off the west coast of Africa, where she's looking to build a home and live in semi-retirement. She has a friend already set up there.\n\nHer feelings of unease in the U.S. started in 2008 with the election of the nation's first Black president. It was a moment to celebrate for the African American community, but it also unleashed virulent racism.\n\nThe neo-Nazi website Stormfront saw traffic increase six times its previous rates after Barack Obama 's election, as Ta-Nehisi Coates points out in The Atlantic . Coates draws a line from the racist backlash directly to Donald Trump . Famously, the racist lie of birtherism helped launch Trump's political career. His time in office has been spent unraveling Obama's policies, even when that's at cross-purposes with the success of his administration.\n\nAfter Obama's victory, this Washington, D.C., woman noticed white acquaintances of hers, people she'd gone to high school with in Michigan, being openly racist on Facebook . They shared memes about the First Family that were offensive: pictures of monkeys and other abhorrent slurs she thought were a relic of the past. \"It's unsettling when you realize people have these beliefs,\" she said.\n\nOf course, she was conscious of racism before that. She was her high school's valedictorian but had been told by a white guidance counselor that her test scores wouldn't be good enough for her to get into a top school - \"like Michelle Obama ,\" she recalled. (A guidance counselor also told the future U.S. first lady that she wasn't \" Ivy League material .\" She applied and was admitted to Princeton anyway.)\n\nThis was different. \"It's like people had just hidden their true feelings for a long time, so there were reasons for them to let them loose,\" she said. \"It was very scary.\"\n\nIn 2016, after spending a year traveling to Brazil, India and South Africa, a light bulb went on. \"I didn't miss the U.S.,\" she said. \"I've seen there are better ways to live in other places.\" She acknowledged that there's racism in these places, too, but nothing as bad as in the United States.\n\n\"Being abroad is the first time I have felt some kind of privilege, if that makes sense. I'm not looked at as a Black person.\"\n\nThis woman and several others mentioned to HuffPost that when they're traveling abroad, they're viewed as Americans in a way that doesn't happen at home. They feel a sense of privilege denied to them at home because of their skin color.\n\n\"I felt seen as a person for the first time,\" Chrishan Wright, a 46-year Black woman from New Jersey, said of a solo trip she took to New Zealand three years ago. She recounted how she was speeding while driving in the country and got pulled over. \"They were so gracious.\"\n\nDuring the pandemic, Wright was laid off from a well-paying marketing job in the pharmaceutical industry. She talked about her time working in the corporate world and feeling like a \"unicorn,\" as one of the few Black women in whatever company she was working in.\n\n\" In the corporate world, it can be very isolating; you are not seeing faces that reflect yours,\" she said. \"If you do something minor, it becomes major. Whereas your [white] counterpart does the same things and it's not even spoken of. You see the double standard.\"\n\nIn June, Wright started a Facebook page called Blaxit Global devoted to African Americans who are considering leaving the country. She'd like to be gone in about three years, when her daughter finishes high school.\n\nBlaxit is a term that some are using now to talk about leaving the U.S. It's also the name of a podcast Wright started up in which she interviews folks who have left or are leaving the country. ( It should not be confused with \"Blexit,\" a term used by conservative commentator Candace Owens to try and get African Americans to leave the Democratic Party .)\n\n\"Blaxit doesn't necessarily mean that you are expected to leave the U.S. and go to the continent of Africa,\" said Wright. \"It's to show that members of the African diaspora, our spores, are sprinkled all over this world and we have the opportunity to create an existence that's unapologetic and unbothered.\"\n\nThere's really nothing new about African Americans seeking to leave the United States to escape the confines of racism and live more freely. A long list of brilliant African American artists and writers have gone abroad to freely pursue their work: Josephine Baker, James Baldwin, Richard Wright, Nina Simone, Paul Robeson.\n\n\"I left this country for one reason only. One reason. I didn't care where I went. I might've gone to Hong Kong, I might've gone to Timbuktu, I ended up in Paris, on the streets of Paris, with $40 in my pocket on the theory that nothing worse could happen to me there than had already happened to me here,\" Baldwin said on \" The Dick Cavett Show \" in 1969. (Watch the clip below at around 10:15)\n\nMore than 200 years ago, Haiti, the first free Black republic in the world, opened its doors to enslaved Africans in the United States. President Abraham Lincoln supported efforts toward creating new \"colonies\" for formerly enslaved people.\n\nBut even then, those efforts were met with resistance. Prominent African Americans like Sojourner Truth and Frederick Douglass believed that the United States was their country, too, as Georges E. Fouron, a professor of Education and Social Sciences at State University of New York at Stony Brook, recounts in a recent piece published by the Migration Policy Institute.\n\n\"The United States was their country, they said, and they had no intention of leaving it,\" Fouron writes. \"Instead, they demanded the immediate abolition of slavery and full and equal rights for all in the United States.\"\n\nThe fight for equal rights and the realization of true freedom continues.\n\n\"Black people, African Americans, are always going to be searching for another kind of freedom. A bigger kind of freedom,\" said Morgan Jerkins, a senior editor at Zora , a Medium publication for women of color, and the author of \"Wandering in Strange Lands: a daughter of the great migration reclaims her roots.\"\n\nAfrican Americans are communal. Jerkins points to Black churches, \"packed in regular times.\" She notes the block parties in her neighborhood in Harlem.\n\nThe pandemic has destabilized all of that. \"When you don't have that community, that does something to you.\"\n\n\"I am proud to be an African American, and I fight for other African Americans. They are the reason I stay.\"\n\nJerkins said she understood the impetus to leave but is among the countless African Americans who aren't going anywhere. \"I stay for so many reasons. So much of my work is based in African American culture,\" she said. While you can do that work anywhere, it wouldn't have the same urgency.\n\nPlus, Jerkins points out that not all African Americans can just leave. That it's a privilege only some can assert.\n\n\"I am proud to be an African American, and I fight for other African Americans,\" she said. \"They are the reason I stay.\"\n\nKitzo-Creed, from Delaware, said she respects that some will stay and fight, but adds there is also strength in leaving and taking care of yourself.\n\n\"My grandparents were civil rights activists; just because they fought for my freedom doesn't mean I have to stay here,\" she said, adding she is grateful that because of their activism, she has that choice.\n\nKitzo-Creed said that her grandfather, a Baptist minister, actually preached with Martin Luther King Jr. when the icon came out to Los Angeles. And her grandparents together moved from Cleveland to the Watts neighborhood of LA, where they were during the civil unrest in that neighborhood in 1965. \"I remember my stories of my grandmother driving past buildings on fire. They lived through all of that.\"\n\nShe said her grandparents, who died five days apart three years ago, always knew she wanted to travel. \"I think they would tell me to do it,\" she said.\n\nDevon Kitzo-Creed's husband, Aaron, 29, told HuffPost he's fully onboard to leave.\n\n\"I want my family, my wife, to be happy and successful and free to pursue education and wealth and opportunities for any children we may have,\" he said. \"I want the American dream and I have to leave to get it.\"\n\nHe added that before he met his wife, he was absolutely aware of racism and knew Black people faced microaggressions. But he didn't really understand its daily psychological impact. \"It wasn't real,\" he said.\n\nThe first time the lightbulb went on, he said, was in his hometown in Maine one summer three years ago. He was excited to take Kitzo-Creed, then his girlfriend, to a local ice cream stand. He used to go there as a kid and even briefly worked there. \"It was a childhood paradise,\" he said.\n\nHe knew the woman behind the counter the day they walked up, and he was disgusted by the way she treated his now-wife when she went to pay for their ice-cream cones - vanilla soft-serve with rainbow sprinkles. Kitzo-Creed pulled out her debit card, which wasn't signed. This is not uncommon. (Right now, in this white reporter's wallet, there are two well-used, unsigned debit and credit cards.)\n\nThe woman behind the counter insisted Kitzo-Creed show an ID. Her partner fought her, pointing out that the woman wasn't checking anyone else's identification to buy ice cream. Kitzo-Creed said that without him there, she probably would've left empty-handed since she hadn't brought her identification that day.\n\nWhen she finally got her cone, there was a hole in the bottom. The woman fought her again when she spoke up.\n\nAaron Kitzo-Creed was floored. He remembered customer service being absolutely a priority at this place. It was just so clear that something else was happening.\n\n\"I don't think I could survive the bullshit that Black Americans walk through daily and succeed,\" he says now, looking back.\n\nIn a survey of 1,500 professionals by the women's advocacy group Catalyst, more than 58% of women and men of color reported being often or always on guard against racism. This emotional tax wears away at human beings and leads many professionals to leave the workplace, so it's not surprising some would take the more extreme leap.\n\n\"This experience of having to constantly prepare yourself for the potential of dealing with discrimination, bias, unfair treatment from the moment you leave the house until you come home,\" is how Catalyst researcher Dnika Travis explained the phenomenon to HuffPost in an interview this summer.\n\nShe's worked on these types of studies since 2016, and over the next few years. \"At the time we thought there was safety within the home, but with Breonna Taylor...\" she drifted off.\n\nMany Black women were heartened this week to see Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) take on Vice President Mike Pence in the vice presidential debate.\n\n\"It was a historic moment,\" writes HuffPost's Erin Evans . \"To see a woman of color speaking truth to power at another pivotal moment in our nation's history.\"\n\nBut the prospect of seeing Harris elected the country's first Black and Asian American vice president wasn't enough to persuade Kitzo-Creed to stick around.\n\n\"I think it would be amazing. Definitely a huge milestone,\" she said. Still, she thinks the sight of a Black woman in such a position of power would set off racists again. \"It's adding fuel to the fire.\""

      "text": "Black Americans Don't Own The Black Experience\n\nAuthor, Blunted on Reality\n\nHere we go again. Samuel L. Jackson's comments about black British actors taking opportunities from black American actors in Hollywood was very disheartening. Unfortunately, I am not shocked by what he said. I wrote a piece in 2016 stating how in my opinion President Obama was ushering in a new era of blackness in the United States. But I guess folks like Samuel L. Jackson didn't get that memo.\n\nIt was sad to hear a great actor like Mr. Jackson suggest that black British actors couldn't play the role of African Americans because they wouldn't understand racism because they somehow didn't deal with it in the U.K. The irony of this situation is that actors like David Oyelowo, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Idris Elba and others come to America because they can't get roles in the U.K. because they are black.\n\nBut we also fail to mention how many times black American actors and actresses have portrayed various historical figures from the African continent. Denzel Washington played the 1970s South African anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko in \"Cry Freedom,\" Forest Whitaker played the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin in the \"Last King of Scotland,\" Morgan Freeman played Nelson Mandela in \"Invictus,\" and the list goes on and on. I heard no such outcry that these men wouldn't be able to relate to the experience of their characters since they were American.\n\nIf people can be honest with themselves, one of the reasons for some of the backlash against black British actors is that they are getting more recognition and accolades for the movies that they are in. Nobody was concerned or worried about who Daniel Kaluuya was until \"Get Out\" grossed $30 million dollars in its opening weekend.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

It has been crazy to see the level of silence from the black American community in this country, as the predominately black countries of Somalia and Sudan were a part of the president's travel ban. The black immigrant community is also witnessing a ton of deportations of undocumented people as well.\n\nFolks also forget that only a small percentage of the Africans who were enslaved came to the United States . The remaining slaves went to the Caribbeans and Latin America. Brazil currently has a population of almost 100 million black people, which is only behind Nigeria's 174 million.\n\nI say all of this to say that black Americans have to get out of their bubbles and see there are a multitude of layers that make up the black experience in this world. As a first generation Nigerian American, I embrace my black British brothers and sisters coming to this country and honing their acting skills. If black American actors and actresses feel threatened by their British counterparts, then maybe it will spark a healthy and friendly competition to make them raise their game to the next level. I see this as a win-win situation for everybody in expanding the black talent pool in acting.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Why This Word Used To Describe Systemic Racism Is So Damn Triggering\n\nContributing Writer\n\nA recent study from Pew Research Center, which found that \"most Black Americans believe U.S. institutions were designed to hold Black people back,\" has gotten some backlash this past week . Although the report has since been revised to acknowledge its misstep, it originally used the term \"racial conspiracy theories\" to describe how Black Americans perceive bias.\n\nThis triggered me. Yes, most of us recognize systemic racism enough to call it out when asked - but its existence is a fact, not a \"belief.\"\n\nThe findings, which shared new data about the Black experience in America, are an extension of a series that aims to understand how Black Americans perceive individual success by identifying what it calls our \"suspicions\" about the barriers we face. The study surveyed 5,000 Black adults about whether they believed claims related to racial bias to be true or false.\n\nOf the \"suspicions\" the study looked to explore, researchers found that about 60% of Black adults surveyed agreed that institutions such as policing, the criminal justice system and the country's economic system are designed to hold Black people back.\n\nThese systems are flawed (or, frankly, broken altogether), and there's evidence that they are stacked against us. We are not outsiders looking in on some social experiment. Black Americans currently live the daily experiences that prove the existence of historical and present-day racial bias.\n\nResearch has shown that \"Black and Hispanic individuals are more likely than White people with similar criminal histories and charges to be arrested and held in jail before trial.\" They also \"tend to have higher bails set and receive lengthier and more punitive sanctions.\"\n\nThere's the yawning wealth disparity that stems from a discriminatory economic system - one that limited where Black Americans were allowed to work and live, and that still persists after centuries . According to more Pew research from just a few years ago, even in low-income households, white families have been shown to have an income four times higher than Black families. Also, it's been shown that majority-Black school districts often receive less funding than districts with more white students.\n\nAll this just scratches the surface of why it feels reductive to frame research about Black Americans as \"believing\" in racial bias or \"perceiving\" institutional racism. And swiftly after social justice organizations such as JustLeadershipUSA vocalized their collective WTF at the word \"conspiracy,\" Pew revised their headline and issued an update.\n\nWhen HuffPost reached out to Pew for comment, a representative said that they \" cannot respond to an editorial that will not be shared\" with them before publishing. However, they did offer to make themselves available to clarify any questions about their research or findings.\n\n\"We recently published a report focused on the suspicions that Black adults might have about the actions of U.S. institutions based on their personal and collective history with racial discrimination,\" the Pew representative wrote. \"The report emphasizes there is a long history of intentional or negligent harm against Black people in the United States.\"\n\n\"Our decision to use a shorthand to describe a complex and mixed battery of findings was a poor choice,\" the representative wrote, \"and we have revised the report.\"\n\nThe Pew report does provide important insight and reflection from members of our community - there's no doubt about that. But seeing the word \"conspiracy\" in the report felt hurtful, because it implied that we're being paranoid . Every day, conservatives are out here misusing terms and concepts like \" woke \" and \" DEI ,\" and making claims about things like \"reverse racism\" to push back against efforts by Black Americans to address systemic injustice.\n\nWe're not being paranoid. We're just being honest.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Learning Black History Is Learning American History\n\nSocial justice organization\n\nChildren at the Baldwin Hills Magnet School in Los Angeles commemorate Black History Month. Photo taken Feb., 2012.\n\nBy Darryl Lorenzo Wellington\n\nFor the past 10 years during Black History Month , I have written an article on why studying Black history ― and other histories of people of color ― is important and necessary. The answer over the years has remained the same: It's important because too many Americans (sometimes including Black Americans) don't know enough about Black American history in a significant, meaningful, and impacting way. And of course, it is a moment in time for us to really delve into how so much of our history was covered up, ignored and distorted.\n\nThis year, I must add to my list of clueless Americans the President of the United States. Consider Donald Trump 's relatively brief Black History Month presentation early in the month, during which he (by now notoriously) referred to Frederick Douglass as \"somebody who's done an amazing job\" as though Frederick Douglass was still alive. Maybe he envisioned a Black Republican or a hard-working White House staffer rather than a preeminent abolitionist who died in 1895. Throughout Trump's Black History Month presentation ( see the video here ) the president often rambled and limited his comments on Black History Month to a few perfunctory remarks read from notes ― but even then he managed to leave many observers befuddled. My own guess would be that he may have had a loose familiarity with Douglass' name sufficient to recall it was somehow associated with Black Americans, but his knowledge otherwise lacked context. He ― and many others ― certainly wouldn't know other contextualizing details such as that Douglass used his renown to convince Abraham Lincoln to fight the Civil war, to issue the Emancipation Proclamation and to establish the major Black regiment in the Union army ― the 54th of Massachusetts . Here's another bit of information people should know (but probably don't): Black History month originated from historian Carter G. Woodson, best remembered for having published The Mis-Education of the Negro in 1933. Woodson originally proposed having a \"Negro History Week\" each February. In 1976, this event officially became Black History Month.\n\nA lack of contextual knowledge regarding Frederick Douglass leads me to ask how much people might know about Olaudah Equiano , Benjamin Banneker , Sojourner Truth , Reconstruction, James Weldon Johnson , the Great Migration , Emmet Till , or the many heroes of the struggle for civil rights who preceded Martin Luther King Jr. Unfortunately, millions of Americans lack background knowledge of these people, places and events that are seminal to American history.\n\nBlack History Month instills a sense of pride and purposefulness in African Americans. It also reminds all Americans that our national history is inherently multi-cultural ― a tapestry of stories of the powerful, of the powerless, of Native Americans, Blacks, whites, and immigrants.\n\nBlack History Month instills pride in African Americans and ensures we recognized the important contributions to this country by African Americans. This photo was taken at Balwin HIlls Magnet School in 2014.\n\nFailing to appreciate our multi-cultural national heritage estranges us, divides us, and hurts us as a nation.\n\nSeveral years ago, I was on a cross-country train ride. I was seated in the observation car alongside a group of college freshmen who told me they were Ivy League students. The group included an African American young lady.\n\nThe train briefly stopped in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia . For any student of African American history, Harpers Ferry WV is not just any place. It's the location of John Brown's raid, a failed military mission to incite a slave revolt which nonetheless stirred tensions which led to the Civil War. For me, the site was the location of a flux of emotions related to the violence, oppression, and inhumanity that preceded emancipation. I rushed to the first available window. The young lady who was African American stole to the window too.\n\nBut her college friends were less than wowed. \"This is Harper's Ferry,\" she explained. \"You know, where John Brown... The raid.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

I could see the disappointment etched on her face while she realized that she and her friends could be united by a common age, enthusiasms and ambitions, yet they still lacked a shared sense of history.\n\nI believe these savvy young people had indeed all covered Harpers Ferry during their educations. But the others had forgotten. The story meant less to them than to the African American young lady. These students needed Black History Month to remind them that we still live in a nation in which our stories too often occupy separate boxes ― in which we stumble to communicate across ethnic and cultural lines in large part because the stories we have been handed down color our perceptions of truth, justice and race relations.\n\nThey needed Black History Month to remind them of the importance of empathy. These bright young minds at an age when knowledge is fruit ripe for the picking still needed Black History Month to fulfill their own potential and America's promise. It's only after the tapestry of American history has been woven together that E Pluribus Unum can truly become meaningful. If you wonder why we still need Black History Month, it is because this month of commemoration and celebration helps us to become better Americans.\n\nDarryl Lorenzo Wellington is a writing fellow for the Center for Community Change.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "'There Will Always Be Struggle': Generations Of Black Americans Have Fought For Justice\n\nPolitics fellow\n\nSeveral days after police killed George Floyd this spring, civil rights hero Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) lamented that too little had changed since a white mob lynched 14-year-old Emmett Till in 1955.\n\n\"Despite real progress, I can't help but think of young Emmett today as I watch video after video after video of unarmed Black Americans being killed, and falsely accused,\" Lewis said in a May 30 statement. \"My heart breaks for these men and women, their families, and the country that let them down - again.\"\n\nLewis, who died last Friday at age 80, had fought for the passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964. He'd led the \"Bloody Sunday\" march for voting rights in Selma, Alabama, in 1965, when the brutal response of law enforcement gained national attention . And this year, he again called on people of \"all faiths and no faiths, and all backgrounds, creeds, and colors\" to take up the fight for racial justice.\n\nIn the 58 days since police killed Floyd, the Black Lives Matter movement has won some victories. Cities across the nation have begun to rethink policing, officers involved in Floyd's death have been arrested and charged, and long-standing racist monuments have been taken down. But there's much left to do, and historians note that if the past is a guide, the movement is still gaining momentum.\n\n\"We are still in the middle of this moment,\" said Charles McKinney, a professor of African American history at Rhodes College.\n\nJust like in the past, photos and video footage have shown what the Black Lives Matter movement is saying ― from the May 5 cellphone video of armed white men in a suburban neighborhood in Georgia chasing and gunning down Ahmaud Arbery to the footage of the last breathless minutes of Floyd's life. Though Americans have long known about systemic racism and have seen instances of police brutality before ― \"250 million white people didn't wake up three months ago and say, 'Oh my god, police brutality is a thing?'\" McKinney said ― these latest images have forced a mainstream conversation.\n\nBut as McKinney noted, \"Images don't necessarily translate into automatic slam-dunk wins and victories.\"\n\n\"These moments where we have video footage of people ― Black people in particular ― being murdered, those images can be widely disseminated. There can be lots and lots of conversations about what we have seen. People can be mad, sad, outraged, angered, disappointed,\" he said. \"We go through all those cycles, and at the end of the day, it is still an open question of whether or not the murderers will be brought to justice and if systems can be altered and shifted and improved for the better.\"\n\nAaron Bryant, social justice curator for the National Museum of African American History and Culture, said that while Black Americans may not be optimistic that change will occur quickly, they are hopeful it will come someday.\n\n\"People haven't given up hope on the American promise or their rights to full citizenship as Americans, and I think that is really important,\" Bryant said.\n\nBoth hope and stamina are crucial, he said, because \"this whole idea of freedom and progress is really through struggle. And there will always be struggle.\"\n\nIt has been 65 years since Till was murdered, and the fight for civil rights and social justice has continued. Here are some of the key moments:\n\nEmmett Till was beaten and killed in Mississippi after a white woman falsely accused him of sexual harassment. He was 14. His murderers were acquitted. The brutality of his death and the publicity that followed sparked outrage and forced America to look at the enduring violence against Black Americans.\n\nRosa Parks, a Black woman in Montgomery, Alabama, refused to give up her seat on a public bus to a white person, a requirement under city segregation laws. This led to her arrest. The NAACP organized a one-day boycott of the bus system, which ultimately continued for 382 days. Later, when reflecting on her actions, Parks said, \"I thought of Emmett Till, and when the bus driver ordered me to move to the back, I just couldn't move.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court affirmed a lower court ruling that segregation on public buses was unconstitutional. It ordered Montgomery to integrate its bus system in December, ending the boycott.\n\nBlack college students Ezell Blair Jr., David Richmond, Franklin McCain and Joseph McNeil organized a sit-in at the Woolworth's lunch counter in downtown Greensboro, North Carolina. Staffers refused them service, but the students refused to give up their seats. The Greensboro Four, as they were later known, were spurred to action by Till's murder. Sit-ins spread throughout the nation and participants faced fines, arrests and, in many cases, violence.\n\nIn the summer of 1960, after tens of thousands of students had joined the sit-ins, many dining facilities were integrated, and at the end of July, the lunch counter at Woolworth's was finally open to Black patrons as well as white ones .\n\nThe Freedom Riders sought to test the Supreme Court's 1960 decision in Boynton v. Virginia, which held that segregation of interstate transportation facilities, including bus terminals, violated federal law. Civil rights activists rode interstate buses throughout the American South, using those facilities the court had ordered to be integrated to challenge the non-enforcement of the court's decision. The protesters were met by arrests, violent attacks and angry white mobs.\n\nThe Interstate Commerce Commission issued regulations banning the segregation of all interstate buses , trains and air terminals, causing signs indicating \"colored\" and \"white\" sections to come down all through the South.\n\nBlack men, women and youth took to the streets in Birmingham, Alabama, for peaceful protests. They were met with violent attacks ― including high-pressure fire hoses and police dogs ― which produced some of the most memorable and troubling images of the civil rights movement. The protesters were calling for desegregation in the city.\n\nA month later, the city desegregated lunch counters, removed \"White Only\" and \"Black Only\" signs from restrooms and drinking fountains, and released a Negro Job Improvement Plan, which focused on employing Black workers.\n\nThree times that month, protesters set off on a 54-mile walk from Selma, Alabama, to the state capital of Montgomery, as part of an effort to register Black voters in the South. They were repeatedly met with violence, most infamously on \"Bloody Sunday,\" when officers tackled the marchers to the ground, chased them down with horses, beat them with whips and batons, and used tear gas. But after Bloody Sunday, the marchers picked themselves up and tried again and again. The third march reached Montgomery.\n\nFollowing years of struggle to secure Black Americans' right to vote, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was signed by President Lyndon Johnson.\n\nLos Angeles erupted into protests over the acquittal of police officers who beat Rodney King ― video of that assault on a Black man became a media sensation ― as well as the probation order for a store owner who had shot and killed a 15-year-old Black girl, Latasha Harlins. Once the protests turned violent, looting and burning followed. After six days of unrest and efforts to quell that unrest, 63 people were dead and over 2,000 injured.\n\nThe Rodney King beating set off a yearslong effort to reform the Los Angeles Police Department. The Christopher Commission was established even before the 1992 unrest to conduct a full examination of LAPD operations. Its July 1991 report laid out the widespread use of excessive force throughout the department. Five years later, the U.S. Department of Justice began investigating the department. In May 2000, it said it had found \"a pattern or practice of excessive force, false arrests, and unreasonable searches and seizures.\" The Justice Department made reform recommendations, and in November 2000, it reached a consent decree with the city allowing for five years of independent monitoring .\n\nGeorge Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer in Florida, fatally shot Trayvon Martin, a Black teenager who was on his way home from the convenience store. Even after the 911 dispatcher told Zimmerman not to pursue the \"suspicious person\" he reported, Zimmerman trailed and shot Martin. The 17-year-old was carrying an iced tea and candy. Protests followed as the nation once again grappled with racism and injustice. But Zimmerman was acquitted in court.\n\nThe hashtag #BlackLivesMatter was first shared on Twitter. It ultimately became the name of an activist organization and the shorthand for a movement.\n\nAfter an officer shot and killed Michael Brown, a Black teenager, protests flared up across Ferguson, Missouri, and were met with a violent police crackdown watched across America. The unrest in Ferguson and elsewhere became a turning point in the conversation about race. One of its major outcomes was dubbed the \"Ferguson Effect\" ― the theory that the exposure of police brutality cultivated by media coverage of the protests led to increased levels of distrust in the police among Americans.\n\nIn the midst of an arrest, a New York police officer used a chokehold on Eric Garner, a Black man, even though that tactic had been banned by the police department. The officer continued to hold Garner on the ground even as he desperately cried \"I can't breathe\" over and over. Bystanders caught it all on video. Protests erupted across New York after a grand jury declined to indict the officer, Daniel Pantaleo, who killed Garner.\n\nFive years after Garner died, the NYPD finally fired Officer Pantaleo.\n\nAfter a Minneapolis police officer knelt on George Floyd's neck and killed him, the nation responded in widespread protests. People in all 50 states joined in Black Lives Matter demonstrations, even in small rural communities where such protests seemed inconceivable just one year before. The recent deaths of Arbery in Georgia at the hands of armed civilians and Breonna Taylor in Kentucky by police executing a no-knock search warrant also fueled the protests. Americans who had lived the Black Lives Matter movement were joined by others who were finally seeing the truth.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

And not only on the Right.\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe only thing more predictable than riots in the United States' dilapidated cities is the outpouring of moralizing pseudo-explanations that accompany them. In this, as in so much else, Ferguson has been no exception. Between riffs on the venerable trope of \"outside agitators,\" commentators groping for an explanation of the uprising have seized on another, equally well-established mythology: the idea of a culture of poverty among black Americans.\n\nRacists began blowing on this particular dog-whistle as soon as the murder of Michael Brown began to attract national attention. No doubt in the coming months it will only get louder. As the sheer scale and brutality of racial inequality in the US comes, however hazily, into popular focus, conservatives across the country will, much like Zionists suddenly concerned with the fate of the Syrian uprising, suddenly evince an intense preoccupation with the lives of black Americans. We will hear how welfare has made blacks dependent on the government, has broken up the black family, and has encouraged a culture of criminality and violence (as evidenced by all that rap music).\n\nVariations on that basic narrative have, of course, become the norm in the language favored by the Right whenever it's confronted with questions of racism. But the influence of the culture of poverty thesis extends far beyond the ranks of Republican officials, Tea Party activists, and Fox News talking heads - apparent, for instance, in the near-universal tendency to turn any discussion of the pervasive inequalities and discrimination suffered by African Americans into a moralizing sermon about the cultural pathologies of black people.\n\nThe New York Times led the way in this regard, sagely informing its readers that Brown was \"no angel\" and detailing accusations that he had committed petty theft and fought with his family. The article went on to say that Brown \"lived in a community that had rough patches, and he dabbled in drugs and alcohol. He had taken to rapping in recent months, producing lyrics that were by turns contemplative and vulgar. He got into at least one scuffle with a neighbor.\"\n\nEven in those venues where this kind of attack on the character of a murdered young black man is recognized for the victim blaming it is, there is a reticence to directly confront the larger claims the culture of poverty theory makes about African-American culture. One can find any number of articles responding to the latest coded racism from the loud Republican of the moment, which point out how conservatives ignore the history of racial oppression and blame the black poor for their own suffering. Far more rare, however, is a direct confrontation with the description of black culture entailed by the culture of poverty narrative.\n\nThis is ironic, because every aspect of that narrative has been subjected to withering criticism by social scientists over the last thirty years. It is not simply that the aspects of black culture that the narrative identifies have been shaped by structural forces like racism; for the most part, they either don't exist at all, or else are reflective of norms and values that are commonplace in the United States - and are not, therefore, unique features of the \"black community.\" Every component of the culture of poverty narrative is a phantasm, a projection of racial fantasies on to the culture of African Americans, which has for several centuries now served as the screen on which the national unconscious plays out.\n\nPut more bluntly, they are lies.\n\nTake, for example, the claim that black youth inhabit a culture that venerates criminality, in which having been incarcerated is a matter of pride. This particular trope has seen heavy circulation in the last few years, trotted out to rationalize every death of a young black man at the hands of the police or vigilantes. Constructed out of a conglomeration of supposedly \"thuggish\" photos, snatches of rap lyrics, or social media ephemera, it works to make respectable the narrative that, in every case, it was the black teenager who threw himself in a fury at the men with guns. Confronted with such deep-seated criminality, the pundits innocently ask, what else were the police supposed to do?\n\nEthnographies of returned prisoners and their families reveal a very different world, one that coincides more with the commonsense notion that people who already face discrimination in the labor market would hardly celebrate events, like incarceration, that will make their lives even harder. Donald Braman spent four years conducting interviews with prisoners, ex-prisoners, and their families in the Washington, DC, area, and found that black families regarded incarceration with anything but pride.\n\nInstead, he found a pervasive sense of shame. Families of those in prison hid the truth from even their extended family, and went to great lengths to conceal the fact from their social circles. In interviewing close to fifty families, Braman reported that not one was \"out\" as having a member in prison to their entire extended family. Reading the stories he collects, one gets a sense of a suffocating stigma, a desperation not to be associated with the prison system in any way.\n\nIn light of Braman's work, the claim that young black men are happy to be locked up is perverse. There is no culture of criminality in black communities. Convenient as it may be to ascribe one to the victims of state violence, all of the evidence suggests that black families work incredibly hard to keep their members out of prison, and feel a profound sense of failure when they are unable to. In fact, compared with white families, black families place an even greater emphasis on following the rules and obeying authority . Given the disproportionate consequences black youth face for their transgressions, this differential is hardly surprising. Yet the disseminators of this lie persist, attempting to convince the nation that African Americans are (\"culturally, not biologically!\" they hasten to add) simply unable to assess even the most brutally obvious consequences of their actions on their lives.\n\nThe disconnect between claims of a culture of criminality and the evidence presented by reality is not at all unusual when it comes to the various elements that make up the culture of poverty narrative. Its other facets are equally guilty of inverting the world in which we live. Consider three prominent claims made by the would-be augurs of black culture: that black students devalue education out of a conception of school as a white thing, that black parents place a low value on marriage and a stable family life, and that the black poor are simply uninterested in finding work. All of these have been given voice across the political spectrum, from liberals to reactionaries, and all of them are patently false.\n\nThe notion of a black disdain for school as a \"white thing\" has been given voice recently by Barack Obama himself. Giving an address for his neoliberal \"My Brother's Keeper\" program, Obama took the opportunity to opine that in black communities \"there's been the notion of 'acting white,' \" where high-achieving black students are stigmatized by their peers. Obama was relatively restrained in his invocation of \"acting white theory,\" as it's called, confining himself to the assertion that it exists and is wrong, insofar as doing well in school does not compromise one's racial authenticity.\n\nThe very fact, however, that the president felt the phenomenon was important enough to comment on suggests that he thought black attitudes on this question were skewed enough to warrant correction. Other commentators have been even bolder in their use of the theory, trotting it out to explain that black attitudes, and not white racism, are the cause of black-white educational disparities.\n\nDespite its ubiquity in popular discussions, however, acting white theory has come under sustained criticism from education scholars. As social scientists have attempted to test the theory, they have found over and over that black and white students' attitudes on education do not differ substantively. Black students, just like their white counterparts, express a desire to do well in school, and report higher self-esteem when they succeed.\n\nIn fact, recent research by Ivory Toldson suggests that it is white male students who express the most ambivalence about the impact of good grades on their social standing. By contrast, 95% of black female students reported that, if they did really well in school, they would be proud and tell all of their friends about it. Similarly, black students were most likely to report that their friends would be happier if they went to college than if they didn't. Most white students said their friends wouldn't care either way.\n\nIn light of this body of research, the attempt to pin responsibility for educational inequality on black students themselves is beyond perverse. Black students, understandably, place a higher premium on education than white students, because they know they will pay a higher price for lacking it than white students will. Yet the aspirations of black students, however well-documented, fail to make any impact on discussions of race and education in national media. White talking heads (and black conservatives, it must be said) feel no qualms whatsoever about loudly condemning the youth of an entire race for lacking ambition, while remaining criminally silent themselves on the structures that actually frustrate black students' real and dearly-held ambitions.\n\nThe story is, if anything, even nastier when it comes to marriage and the family. Lamentations over the decline of the black family, in particular, are something of a national ritual in the United States, and have been for decades. In the inner city, we are told, there is a culture of single parenting, and having children with multiple partners. From here, descriptions of that culture frequently veer into the luridly racist, with \"broodmares\" being one epithet of choice for black mothers. This culture is then held to be at the root of any number of problems, as absent fathers are blamed for black children doing poorly in school or getting in trouble, and mothers dependent on welfare programs inducing a \"culture of dependency\" in their children.\n\nOnce again, this narrative is profoundly mistaken. Historically, as Herbert Gutman pointed out decades ago, black Americans have placed a tremendous value on maintaining family structures, and have actually had a lower divorce rate than white Americans. Since the 1960s, it's true that single-parent households have become far more common in black communities (though not only there), and this is the era commentators typically focus on, blaming the loss of a mythological united community under Jim Crow in more liberal versions of the story, or welfare programs in more reactionary ones. Both, however, see a transformation in black attitudes as central.\n\nBut social scientists working on family structures, however, have found that variables like the ratio of employed men to women are far stronger predictors of what families look like than attitudes are. When the supply of employed, non-incarcerated men is controlled for, black and white marriage rates look more similar than different.\n\nAttitudes towards marriage also display no great divergence between black and white Americans. Most black Americans value marriage highly, though, as is the case with whites, men tend to value it more highly than women. This last datum is particularly ironic, given the pervasive scapegoating of black men for supposedly abandoning their children after conception. In fact, as numerous studies have found, black fathers maintain high levels of contact with their children even when not co-habitating with the child's mother, and express a strong desire to be even more present in their children's lives. Even more significantly, as Kathryn Edin has noted , \"African Americans' higher valuation of marriage relative to that of whites narrows the racial gap in marriage.\" Black culture is responsible for the gap in marriage rates being smaller than it otherwise would be, not larger.\n\nWith this in mind, the recurrent political fantasy of addressing inequality in the US through marriage promotion programs aimed at the black poor in particular is a sick joke. If people like Sam Brownback, who wrote one of the most recent such proposals , actually cared about the marriage rate among poor black Americans, he would address himself to ending things like mass incarceration and the endemic joblessness in American cities, which all the evidence suggests play a massive role in disrupting black attempts to form stable nuclear families. The irony, of course, is that his preferred alternative is predicated on attempting to sell something to African Americans that they have been trying for literally centuries to buy at a price higher than he could possibly imagine.\n\nOne final component of the culture of poverty, and in some ways the most central, is the myth that the black unemployed simply don't want to find work. This was given particularly vulgar voice recently by Samuel \"Joe the Plumber\" Wurzelbacher, whose relentless self-promotion is indeed a monument to what hard-working white ethnics, with the help of a complicit media, can achieve. Commenting on the protesters in Ferguson, he suggested that the best way to disperse the demonstrators would be to hold a job fair, at the sight of which they would \"scatter like leaves.\" Though the sheer contempt for the black poor may be more visible in Wurzelbacher's quip than in other instances, in substance it doesn't differ in the least from Republican wunderkind Paul Ryan's pronunciation that inner city men simply don't appreciate the value of work.\n\nThis conceit has suffered perhaps more thorough rebuttal than any other component of the culture of poverty. Since the 1960s, social scientists have produced study after study demonstrating that poor and unemployed black Americans have basically the same attitudes towards work as the rest of country. In fact, a recent study found that black job seekers are even more resilient than their white counterparts, staying in the job market longer despite persistent frustrations of their search for employment. One waits in vain for such results to generate a moral panic over the decline of a work ethic in white communities.\n\nWhen it comes to the notion of welfare dependency, the verdict is much the same. One study looking at black single mothers in Milwaukee found that these women's families were a major contributor to the high value they placed on education and finding a career. Far from being the transmission belt of a \"culture of dependency,\" black families act as a support network encouraging their members to achieve as much as possible. The same study found that women on welfare, almost to a person, \"hated it\" and wished they could leave the program. However, the demands of childcare, combined with a lack of job opportunities, ensured that leaving was difficult for most.\n\nOther studies have found similar results, with welfare being largely stigmatized in black communities. In fact, a number of studies have found that people on welfare, black Americans included, feel that people take advantage of the system and receive benefits when they should not. Here, the constant demonization of people on welfare has had an effect on welfare recipients themselves. While attributing their own use to structural factors such as discrimination and joblessness, they attribute others' use of the system to laziness (importantly, however, this suspicion does not carry over into political support for attacks on welfare state, which are consistently opposed by people receiving benefits). The distance from the popular portrayal of black communities content to remain on the dole could not be clearer.\n\nAll of this is to suggest that the constant projections onto some kind of collective black psyche obscures the fact that African Americans and white Americans are motivated by much the same things. Still, the absence of evidence for their existence hasn't prevented these tropes of black cultural pathologies from entering into nearly every discussion of \"race relations\" in recent years. Indeed, belief in a black culture of poverty has become so entrenched that it is accepted without question for the most part. The prevalence of those assumptions are inseparable from the dominance of a politics that rejects structural solutions for the social disparities and entrenched discrimination facing African Americans, in favor of an emphasis on community self-help and personal responsibility.\n\nThus, we find ourselves in a situation in which public discussion of problems related to high rates of joblessness, child poverty, infant mortality, and many negative social indicators among African Americans is largely restricted to exhortations for a transformation of behavioral norms and attitudes. Instead of a political agenda to deal with pervasive disparities in wealth, educational opportunities, access to employment, and the like, we're told that upward mobility for African Americans depends on the inculcation of values that promote success; black communities, this approach suggests, must learn to celebrate family, encourage hard work, and embrace education.\n\nNot full employment but individual initiative and a commitment to advancement through low-wage work and job training will boost chronically low employment levels. Not a substantial program of redistributive reforms but incentives to encourage entrepreneurship will boost the resources of the black community. Not strengthened anti-discrimination measures or equal access to health care but altered lifestyle choices, better parenting, and the influence of positive role models will reduce health disparities and improve social outcomes for black kids.\n\nImplicit in all this is the idea that if African Americans have failed to overcome the racial stratification of American society, the reason is to be found - at least in large part - in the cultural and psychological character of the black community. The result has been the diffusion of a language around \"race\" that mirrors the \"color-blind\" racism associated with the post-Civil Rights era - a language that simultaneously downplays the significance of actual discrimination while stigmatizing African Americans for behaviors that go unremarked upon in the case of white Americans.\n\nIt is, for instance, not uncommon for conversations that are ostensibly addressing issues like mass incarceration and police violence to devolve into criticism of the dressing habits of young black men or the hedonism and violence in rap lyrics. The double standard at work here should be obvious: no one, for instance, questions whether the predilection of white teenagers for personal attire that can range from the bizarre to the obscene shouldn't make them the objects of scrutiny by police or potential employers. Bill Cosby's rant attacking black Americans for everything from the linguistic habits of black teenagers to the names given to black children was treated by everyone from Barack Obama to Bill O'Reilly as a serious call for self-reflection by the \"black community.\" Yet it would be impossible to imagine a situation in which the personal appearance and lifestyle choices of attendees at the annual Burning Man festival would ever inspire such anxiety.\n\nThe upshot is that even sympathetic observers tend to interpret concerns about deprivation and social disorganization through the prism of cultural or psychological damage. That dynamic is particularly evident in our proclivity to attribute problems like crime or violence in black neighborhoods to ill-defined features of black men's emotional existence. As a consequence, responsibility for these issues is commonly attributed to such causes as a lack of self-regard among African-American males, their purportedly nihilistic and myopic worldview, or their orientation on short-term, narrowly self-interested gain over long-term ambition and social uplift.\n\nThat tendency to speculate about the emotional or psychological state of young black men is emblematic of the way that \"race\" functions in America. In translating discussions of questions like crime and violence into explorations of group psychology, we effectively shift the focus from the social context for street violence in lower-income, predominantly black urban areas to the character of black people. That not only reinforces a blame-the-victim politics that refuses to acknowledge racism - embodied in the cynical use of the category \"black on black crime\" to dismiss concerns about police violence during the Ferguson protests - it also leads to a distorted view of the sources of elevated violence and chronic insecurity in black neighborhoods.\n\nPart of the reason that the trope of \"black on black crime\" has garnered such traction is because it feeds on very genuine concerns about issues like the high levels of violence crime suffered by some black communities. While homicide rates have declined precipitously across the US over the past two decades, the devastating number of shooting deaths suffered by black residents in cities like Chicago has received national attention in recent years. Confronted with the destructive effects of gun violence, many observers have interpreted it as a reflection of deep-seated social pathologies - the inverse of the racism of the US criminal justice system.\n\nResearch suggests that violent crime rates are driven by a variety of social factors which tend to make American cities particularly prone to gun violence against black residents. Among the most of these factors are very high levels of neighborhood segregation, concentrated un- and underemployment , poverty and a dearth of adequate social services or institutional resources . Fundamentally, gun violence has to be treated like other kinds of public health problems - not as the basis for continuous, empty calls for an introspective discussion about \"black on black violence.\" And like other kinds of public health disparities , tackling high rates of inter-personal violence requires confronting the social context in which it occurs.\n\nAnd yet, the culture-of-poverty narrative leads us away from that perspective, and exacerbates the widespread tendency to view social inequality through the lens of personal responsibility and cultural predispositions.\n\nGiven that the culture of poverty argument today is most strongly associated with the Right, it is surprising to learn that its provenance actually comes from the other end of the spectrum. The phrase itself achieved notoriety with Daniel Patrick Moynihan's famous report on the black family (\" The Negro Family: The Case for National Action \"), though he had himself drawn it from anthropologist Oscar Lewis' work. In the decades since then, as \"the Moynihan report\" has, quite properly, come to serve as shorthand on the Left for a pathologization of the black family and a victim-blaming rhetoric, it has been easy to forget that Moynihan himself was no Strom Thurmond, but a Great Society liberal with impeccable credentials. The concept itself comes not from the Right, which was then still mired in explicitly biological racism, but from liberals cognizant of the injustice of inequality, but too attached to ideas of black deficiency to jettison them entirely.\n\nAs American liberalism has moved steadily rightward since the 1970s, versions of the culture-of-poverty thesis have gained increasingly traction. In Moynihan's time, these sorts of ideas were counterbalanced by a liberalism that genuinely sought the expansion of the American welfare state. Hubert Humphrey, running for president in 1968, promised to hire a teacher for every policeman Richard Nixon wanted to hire, and build a house for every jail George Wallace wanted to build. By the 1990s, this sort of commitment had nearly disappeared from American liberalism, leaving culture of poverty arguments hegemonic. The importance of the culture-of-poverty approach is that it allows for recognition of the accumulated history of racism and inequality, but posits the ongoing effects of these as mediated through black cultural pathologies. It therefore permits American liberals to identify with opposition to racism while pushing them towards policy solutions geared towards the transformation of black people, and not American society.\n\nToday, these ideas are given voice by all manner of actors residing left of center on the political spectrum. Barack Obama's few engagements with the subject of racial inequality all draw on the idea of a culture of poverty, even if never explicitly named as such, from his condescending hectoring of black fathers to his gross suggestion that too many black parents feed their children fried chicken for breakfast. Jonathan Chait has also recently revealed himself to be an adherent, criticizing Ta-Nahesi Coates' recent writing for being insufficiently attentive to the deficiencies of black culture.\n\nThe Reverend Al Sharpton gave a particularly abhorrent reminder that conservatives have no monopoly on the culture of poverty at Michael Brown's funeral. In his eulogy , Sharpton lectured the assembled audience on the need for greater personal responsibility in the black community: \"We have got to be outraged by our disrespect for each other, our disregard for each other, our killing and shooting and running around gun-toting each other,\" he said, \"so that they're justified in trying to come at us because some of us act like the definition of blackness is how low you can go. . .\" In contrast to earlier generations of African Americans, who were presumably more worthy of equal rights, black people today exhibit a proclivity for bad behavior and bad manners, Sharpton said, concluding \"Now, you want to be a n-- and call your woman a 'ho.' You've lost where you're coming from.\"\n\nFor many on the Left, it's easy to recognize how backwards and self-defeating this kind of rhetoric can be. In shifting the locus of responsibility for the deep-seated inequities of American capitalism to the very people who are the victims of its greatest injustices, Sharpton is playing into the hands of the white conservatives who so often attack him for playing the \"race card.\"\n\nAnd yet the notion that the entrenched racial disparities of US society are, at least in part, the product of black cultural pathologies, retains enormous traction. Sharpton and Cosby are hardly alone among black Americans in identifying with versions of this narrative. A recent survey , for example, revealed that black men both tend to value education and work highly, yet thought that other black men spent too much time thinking about sports and sex. So pervasive is this ideology that people who know it to be false of themselves are willing to believe it of others. The argument can also take a more nationalist register, as in the contention that slavery damaged black American culture so profoundly that the resulting cultural deficiencies, often identified as a lack of community or self-respect, explain aspects of black inequality today, from educational disparities to economic impoverishment.\n\nForty years ago, both black nationalism and American liberalism existed in forms that looked squarely at the basic structure of American society for an explanation of racial inequality. The shift of both these ideologies away from that orientation in subsequent decades is in line with the larger retreat of the Left away from structural solutions and into more local and personalized projects. Effectively, the Left's horizons have shrunk in tandem with its social power.\n\nWhen it comes to race, however, this retreat has had particularly pernicious effects. The shrinking of ambition to the personal level here has resulted in a convergence with the kinds of victim-blaming narratives peddled in official \"colorblind\" ideology. When liberals or black nationalists agree that black crime contains some larger meaning about the state of the black community, they make the work of racist ideologues easier. They reinforce the basic point that black crime must be agonized over as a barometer of the cultural values of the race, while white crime may be treated as a normal aspect of a complex society.\n\nIn doing so, they give succor to those who seek to block any attempt at addressing the real causes of racial inequality, while rendering half-hearted and tenuous those attempts still being launched from within American liberalism itself. And all on the basis of ideas that, for all liberals' supposed commitment to reason and moderation, are no more connected with reality than birther fantasies.\n\nLike so many other \"zombie ideas\" in our current moment, the culture of poverty narrative persists not because of its success in explaining reality, but in spite of it. What it does succeed in doing is providing an explanation of reality that salves the consciences of the powerful and their supporters. Unfortunately, in an era when collective action by the oppressed is still far too sporadic and ephemeral, these kinds of explanations have sunk deep roots, into both layers of left-liberal opinion and oppressed groups themselves.\n\nYet what the social science literature demonstrates is that however secure the culture of poverty seems as a hegemonic explanation for racial inequality, it ultimately rests on what are, at the end of the day, nothing more than lies. As the uprising in Ferguson has highlighted the connection between American imperialism and militarism on the home front, it is worth remembering that cultural explanations of structural processes have never been a purely domestic affair.\n\nCommenting on the horrific death toll of the Vietnamese during the American war on Vietnam, William Westmoreland infamously explained to an interviewer that \"the Oriental doesn't put the same high price on life as does a Westerner. Life is plentiful. Life is cheap in the Orient.\" For a long time, this remark epitomized the racism of the war. We should view cultural explanations of inequality with the same contempt.\n\nPaul Heideman holds a PhD in American studies from Rutgers University-Newark.\n\nJonah Birch is a visiting assistant professor in sociology at Appalachian State University and a contributing editor at Jacobin .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

In truth, for many, the GI Bill was a rare positive experience with government that contrasted sharply with the indignities of Jim Crow.\n\nCollege students at Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland, 1955.

Reflecting later to his wife, Celeste Torian, he said of postwar America, \"The only good thing was the GI Bill.\"\n\n\"Every black we knew used the GI Bill,\" Celeste told political scientist Suzanne Mettler. Gentry used it to fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a public schoolteacher.\n\nScores of black veterans across the country had experiences similar to the Torians'. The Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, popularly known as the GI Bill, offered an exceptionally comprehensive list of benefits to World War II (and later Korean War) veterans. Any veteran with at least ninety days of service and without a dishonorable discharge was eligible. The benefits included unemployment payments of $20 per week for up to one year and low-interest loans to buy a house, farm, or business.\n\nBut the GI Bill is perhaps best known for how it transformed higher education in this country. Veterans who served for at least ninety days were guaranteed one year of education or vocational training, with another month added for each additional month of service up to four years. Veterans who used these benefits did not have to pay a dime in tuition costs, and they even received monthly subsistence payments.\n\nIt has become a popular trope to insist that black veterans did not benefit in any substantial way from the GI Bill. For example, the famous professor of African American history Henry Louis Gates Jr asserted that the \"GI Bill systematically excluded most African Americans\" in a recent YouTube video . In early 2022, this historical interpretation of the GI Bill compelled the introduction of a bill that would extend certain GI Bill benefits to surviving spouses and some direct descendents of black World War II veterans.\n\nIt is certainly true that there were problems and limitations in the implementation of GI Bill benefits for black veterans. But many of those limitations were a product of a Jim Crow system that predated the bill's passage. The GI Bill did not create these structural limitations, and the elimination of Jim Crow was always beyond the scope of the legislation's ability.\n\nA wholesale dismissal of the legislation obscures the fact that black veterans' experience of the GI Bill was far more nuanced and positive than many critics suggest. Their stories are documented in Suzanne Mettler's work, including her book Soldiers to Citizens: The G.I. Bill and the Making of the Greatest Generation and her article specifically about black veterans, \"The Only Good Thing was the G.I. Bill.\"\n\nInterviews with people like Celeste Torian reveal that, for many black veterans and their families, the GI Bill represented an exceptionally positive experience with government that contrasted sharply with the indignities of Jim Crow. To ignore this experience is to discount the role of the expanded welfare state in improving the lives of black Americans in the context of extreme racial inequality.\n\nWhen it came to implementation, the GI Bill fell shortest in its distribution of low-interest home loans. Here, the long-standing discriminatory practices of the real estate industry were the decisive factor.\n\nThough the federal government guaranteed the loan, applicants had to find a bank or lending agency they could use. Local banks often denied loans to black individuals and families. Ebony magazine reported that out of 3,329 VA-backed loans in Mississippi in 1947, only two went to black veterans. One black veteran in a survey testified, \"I was required to make a 10 percent down payment because I was told that colored GIs were a bad risk.\"\n\nThere is no question that black GIs were largely unable to take advantage of the GI Bill's home loan benefits. However, black veterans' experience with the educational benefits of the GI Bill were much more positive.\n\nToo often, scholars have used a narrow framework through which to evaluate the usage of GI Bill benefits. Several academic papers have asserted that the educational inequality between blacks and whites was worsened due to the GI Bill. But that conclusion can only be sustained if one focuses exclusively on college attendance and graduation. This perspective fails to take into account both inequalities that predated the GI Bill and the full scope of educational benefits offered.\n\nBy the end of World War II, only 17 percent of black soldiers had graduated from high school, compared to 41 percent of white soldiers. Clearly, black veterans were not as well-positioned to use the benefits for college education as their white counterparts. Most black veterans utilized the GI Bill for vocational training and other noncollege programs. Overall, 3.5 million veterans gained vocational training through the GI Bill, causing the number of trade schools in the country to triple.\n\nWhen taking into account the full range of GI Bill benefits, black veterans actually made use of them at a higher rate than white veterans. A 1950 Veterans Affairs study found that 49 percent of nonwhite veterans had used the benefits, compared to 43 percent of white veterans. Surprisingly, black veteran usage was higher even in the Jim Crow South: 56 percent of nonwhite Southern veterans had used the GI Bill by 1950, compared to 50 percent of white veterans.\n\nIn the North, widespread usage of the GI Bill by black veterans advanced the desegregation of institutions of higher education in the early postwar period. Black veteran Reginald Wilson remembered that one-third of the veterans at his alma mater Wayne State University were black at the time he attended.\n\nTuskegee Airman Henry Harvey used the GI Bill to attend Northwestern University. In an interview with Mettler, he reflected that, without the GI Bill, \"I possibly would have continued my education, but it would have been at a local junior college . . . where the tuition was $60 a semester. . . . So there's a possibility I would have gone to college, but it would have taken much longer.\"\n\nIn the Jim Crow South, the choices for black veterans were more limited due to the segregation of higher education. Again, this was not an effect of the GI Bill but a preexisting practice that the GI Bill itself could not remedy.\n\nEven as all-white colleges kept black veterans out, historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) like Howard University, Morgan State University, Morehouse College, and more greatly expanded due to the increased demand. Between 1946 and 1947, overall enrollment at colleges and universities increased by 13 percent, but enrollment at HBCUs expanded by 26 percent.\n\nWhile the expansion of HBCUs could be seen as positive, the manner in which it took place during this period was not ideal. Already underfunded, HBCUs did not have the proper resources to absorb this increased enrollment. Many students reported overcrowded classrooms and inadequate living conditions. Nevertheless, while the GI Bill did not overturn educational inequality in the South, it did dramatically increase educational opportunities for African Americans.\n\nAvailable data suggests that the GI Bill may have been even more meaningful to black veterans than to white veterans, perhaps because it stood out so sharply from the discrimination they experienced in other areas of life. In a World War II veterans survey, 92 percent of black higher education beneficiaries and 89 percent of black noncollege beneficiaries in the 92nd Infantry Division considered the bill a turning point in their lives. Only 78 percent of white higher education beneficiaries and 58 percent of white noncollege beneficiaries said the same.\n\nIn Mettler's countless interviews and testimonials, black veterans from the 92nd Infantry Division detailed the many ways the GI Bill acted as a positive force in their lives. One beneficiary claimed that the program \"broadened my scope of knowledge, made me hireable, interesting; increased my friendships, which now, fifty years later, still permeate my life.\"\n\nOthers said the GI Bill \"helped me get a job with General Motors,\" \"gave me a chance to try other venues of work,\" or simply \"helped me make a decent living for my family.\" These accounts from black veterans themselves need to be fully taken into account when considering the effects of the GI Bill.\n\nMettler goes further than just asserting that the GI Bill was a positive experience for most black veterans. She also makes a compelling argument that the program helped boost civic engagement and civil rights activism among its beneficiaries.\n\nAgain, the GI Bill could not and did not end Jim Crow. Even after gaining an education using the GI Bill, most black veterans faced fierce discrimination in the job market. But that process itself had an interesting effect: the experience of the GI Bill raised black veterans' expectations of government, helping throw into sharper relief the gap between the way they were treated and what they knew was possible. Mettler explains:\n\nAfter the war they encountered the discriminatory job market and social system, but they knew from their G.I. Bill experience that they had the right to be treated on equal terms to other Americans. Thus, their encounter with discrimination at this juncture provoked their political mobilization, as the fundamental unfairness of such treatment became all the more evident and intolerable following experiences that differed so sharply.\n\nAvailable data supports this assertion. During the height of the civil rights movement, from 1950 to 1974, 35 percent of black GI Bill users participated in protest activities, compared to 8 percent of nonblack GI Bill users. Black GI Bill users were overrepresented in the organizations that were most active in the fight for civil rights, such as the NAACP and Urban League.\n\nBetween 1965 and 1979, during the height of new local black governing regimes, 31 percent of black GI Bill users were involved in local government compared to 4 percent of black nonusers. Black veterans were also very active in fraternities that played an important supporting role during the civil rights movement, such as Alpha Phi Alpha, Omega Psi Phi, and Kappa Alpha Psi.\n\nThe story of Hosea Williams is a great example of this dynamic. Williams used the GI Bill to complete high school and then went on to earn a master's degree in chemistry from Morris Brown College. After getting hired by the US Department of Agriculture as a research chemist, Williams was recruited to serve on the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and Martin Luther King Jr's staff.\n\nNAACP field secretary Medgar Evers used his GI Bill benefits to enroll at Alcorn State University in Mississippi. His college experience prepared him for a life of activism as he became class president, yearbook editor, and student newspaper editor. Most important of all, Evans was exposed to the civil rights movement on campus.\n\nThe GI Bill has received much the same treatment in American political discourse as the New Deal. It has become fashionable to simplistically dismiss New Deal social programs as hopelessly racist and unavailable to African Americans. While there is no denying that New Deal benefits were not distributed equally, these historical accounts propagate a wildly misleading picture of how black people actually interacted with the New Deal in its totality.\n\nIn the context of a thoroughly racist society, the New Deal represented a significant step forward for many black working people. As scholars like Adolph Reed have tirelessly pointed out , blacks were overrepresented in many New Deal programs like the Works Progress Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps, where black workers made up a larger share than their percentage in the overall population.\n\nFar from an abstract academic debate, cynical and inaccurate depictions of the New Deal have been used to try to discredit both of Bernie Sanders's presidential campaigns and the overall growing social democratic tendency in US politics. There is a similar danger in ignoring the complexity of black Americans' experience with the GI Bill.\n\nA more accurate and nuanced appreciation of the GI Bill's usage among black veterans is needed. The program's large-scale success should give us hope that governance for the public good is possible again for all working people, regardless of their race.\n\nPaul Prescod is a Jacobin contributing editor.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

That's why Bernie Sanders's strong support for defending and expanding the USPS is a key racial justice issue.\n\nPostal workers protest USPS cuts in Chicago, 2011.

But it's also a quip with a serious material basis for black workers who have found in the US Postal Service employment stability and upward mobility for generations.\n\nMany prominent black Americans paid the bills by working the mail as they pursued their larger ambitions. Dick Gregory worked as a postal worker in Chicago during the daytime before refining his stand-up routine at night. In between gigs, the jazz great Charles Mingus put on a USPS uniform. As he was building his career as a writer in the late 1920s and early 1930s, Richard Wright worked in the post office, and he referenced this experience in early novels. Even the famous communist Harry Haywood worked for the postal service after fighting in World War I.\n\nFor the average black worker, the postal service represents a stable, decent-paying career that is hard to find elsewhere. Today the average salary of a USPS employee is $55,000, and 21 percent of USPS employees are black. The history of black postal workers demonstrates the critical importance of government employment and a robust public sector for the advancement of black people in this country.\n\nIn 2019 the postal service, just like the public sector more generally, is under attack from Republicans and centrist Democrats alike. This attack represents a severe threat to the living standards of a large section of black workers and their families.\n\nSaving and expanding the public sector will be a key fight for racial justice in the 2020 presidential race. Bernie Sanders, with his call for postal banking and robust government programs , is the only candidate offering a real plan to revive the postal service and the futures of black public-sector workers.\n\nThe story of black workers in the post office begins with the legal end of slavery and the soldiers who fought for that freedom. As early as 1861, federal employment was opened up for black workers. In December 1864, Senator Charles Sumner passed a bill banning discrimination in postal employment. Though not always enforced, this protection was critical for enabling black workers to establish a foothold in a relatively stable and secure occupation.\n\nMany black Union Army veterans joined the postal service after the Civil War ended. Take William Harvey Carney. Carney escaped from slavery in the 1850s and eventually volunteered for the 54th Massachusetts Regiment. In 1869 he became a postal worker and served for thirty years, becoming the founding vice president of the National Association of Letter Carriers (NALC) Branch 18. The NALC itself grew out of the Milwaukee local of the Grand Army of the Republic, the national fraternal organization of Union Army veterans. Black postmasters during the Reconstruction era were seen as a threat to white supremacy because of their elevated community status and importance.\n\nDespite the opportunities in the postal service, various forms of discrimination were still present, and blacks were prevented from working as railway mail clerks. This led to the formation of the mostly black National Alliance of Postal Employees (NAPE), which was led by college-educated intellectuals and viewed itself more as a civic organization than a labor union. This perspective led NAPE to closely ally and collaborate with the NAACP in the early twentieth century.\n\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, black civil rights activity had a decidedly working-class character and was closely intertwined with the labor movement. Black postal workers and their unions formed a crucial pillar of this black-labor alliance.\n\nThis development was reflective of the heightened status and political importance black postal workers had attained by this time. For example, in 1935 blacks made up nearly a third of the Postal Workers of America (Local 9) in New York City and 12 percent of all public workers. By 1940, 14 percent of all black workers who earned above the national median income worked for the post office.\n\nPostal workers played an important role in expanding the working-class base of the NAACP in the 1920s and 1930s. By 1940, postal workers led some of the NAACP's largest branches in New Orleans, Norfolk, and Mobile. Chicago NAPE activist Henry W. McGee's election in 1946 as local NAACP president represented a victory over the \"silk stocking crowd\" that looked down on his status as a worker and his strategy of grassroots militancy. This tactic of working-class infiltration of NAACP branches was used by many other unions at the time, like the United Packinghouse Workers of America and the United Auto Workers.\n\nNAPE used this position to push the federal government on antidiscrimination measures for federal employees. With the help of the NAACP, they forced Franklin D. Roosevelt to get rid of the application photo requirement by executive order in November 1940, a requirement often used to screen out black applicants.\n\nThree years later, Roosevelt's Executive Order 9346 moved the Fair Employment Practices Commission to the Office of Emergency Management and broadened its scope to include government agencies, creating space for more antidiscrimination measures to be pushed through. It became especially important for black workers during the postwar period, as the number of black federal employees shot up to around 150,000.\n\nThe shift to unions and working-class activists taking the lead on civil rights issues was a dramatic change to the ideology of what black leadership was supposed to look like. Historian Martha Biondi explains , \"In an era when unionized blue and white-collar employment was becoming a stepping stone to a middle-class lifestyle, autoworkers and meatpackers, nurses and postal workers, displaced the 'talented tenth' as agents of black community advancement.\"\n\nA common theme throughout black history has been the importance of an activist federal government for advancing fundamental interests. Postal workers utilized executive orders in particular to improve their situation in the 1960s. This activism and the resulting legislation created a home for black women workers in the post office as well.\n\nAmong the few highlights in John F. Kennedy's lackluster record on civil rights are his executive orders related to federal employment. Executive Order 10925 was issued in March 1961 and banned discrimination by employers and unions in federal contract work, followed by Executive Order 10988, which provided limited collective bargaining rights for federal employee unions that didn't practice racial discrimination. These orders came after intense lobbying pressure from NAPE and the Negro American Labor Council.\n\nThe Equal Pay Act of 1963 was a key factor in helping black women find work in the post office in large numbers. For many black women, federal employment was a refuge from the highly unfavorable conditions that confronted them in the private sector. A monthly newsletter from the Manhattan-Bronx Postal Union in 1966 described the situation: \"It is important to note that most of the women coming into the Post Office are Negroes. Reflecting conditions in the American economy and the unfair treatment that they have received on the outside down through the years, these women come into the Federal government hoping that they will get a fair shake.\"\n\nIn fact, the post office was one of the only federal civilian agencies that saw an entry of large numbers of blacks and women during the Kennedy administration. Many black postal union activists went on to become active in the campaign to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Special praise was given to Title VII, which made equal employment opportunity the law of the land. Fittingly, Martin Luther King Jr was the featured speaker at NAPE's 1965 Los Angeles convention. Black postal workers recognized that, as federal employees, it was their job to force the federal government to act in their interests.\n\nAs early as 1971, changes were being made to the postal system that disproportionately hurt black workers. After the 1970 Postal Strike , postal facilities were relocated to suburban areas in an effort to diffuse militancy. Black postal workers bore the brunt of this job loss, as NAPE vice president Wesley Young explained at the time. \"The postal service has long been a place where Negroes who were denied jobs in the private sector could earn a decent living. But with the loss of this many jobs, you'll just about break the back of the black middle class.\"\n\nToday the threats to the USPS go beyond the movement of jobs to the destruction of the system as we know it. William Burrus, the first black president of the American Postal Workers Union, said that destroying the postal service will \"put an end to the relationship between people of color and their opportunity to climb up the ladder of success in our country . . . The post office has permitted millions of African-Americans to better themselves.\"\n\nIn 2006, Congress passed the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act. This act manufactured a financial crisis by forcing the Postal Service to pre-fund all retiree health care costs seventy-five years into the future, even for workers not yet born. No other company or government agency has to abide by such a law. This alone has robbed the USPS of an estimated $5.6 billion over a ten-year period. Clearly this is part of a broader plan to privatize the Postal Service and attack the living standards of postal workers . Privatizing will only lead to reduced services and higher prices, as happened in the UK when the country privatized its postal system in 2015.\n\nToday, one in five black workers is employed in a government job. The slower recovery for blacks in the labor market is partly due to federal job cuts. For many black workers, public sector employment represents the thin line between a decent living and debilitating poverty. In 2000, the median income of black men who worked full time in the public sector was 15 percent higher than those who worked full time in the private sector. For black women, it was 19 percent higher. Good Postal Service jobs are ones we can't afford to lose.\n\nWhat does all this have to do with Bernie Sanders? He is one of the only candidates who puts saving the USPS high on his agenda and champions reforms like postal banking.\n\nAs Sanders puts it, \"Post offices exist in almost every community in our country. There are more than 31,000 retail post offices in this country. An important way to provide decent banking opportunities for low-income communities is to allow the U.S. Postal Service to engage in basic banking services.\" And beyond increasing revenue and employment for the USPS, this measure would eliminate the prevalence of payday loan centers that prey on poor communities of color.\n\nIn addition to postal banking, Sanders has pushed for a vast expansion of services that can be offered. This includes notarizing documents, wrapping presents, shipping alcoholic beverages, and even digital services. He is also calling for restoring postal services that have been recently cut, such as overnight delivery.\n\nAs a senator, Sanders has concrete legislative victories to his name. He fought the recent wave of post-office closures and led the successful effort to pass a Senate resolution restoring service standards. Additionally, he blocked privatizers and payday-lending-industry lobbyists from being on the postal board of governors.\n\nSanders's record led the American Postal Workers Union (APWU) to endorse Bernie in 2016. APWU president Mark Dimondstein described Sanders as \"a true champion of postal workers and other workers throughout the country. He is a fierce advocate of postal reform to address the cause of the USPS financial crisis, an outspoken opponent of USPS policy that degrades mail service.\"\n\nSanders's program would materially improve the lives of black Americans and strengthen old policies that already have. His agenda would vastly expand federal employment and create new federal programs that would disproportionately benefit workers of color. A Sanders presidency would also embody the kind of activist government that has instituted far-reaching reforms for black people in the past. He has a clear-eyed sense of the hostile Congress that would await him, and he is more likely to push through radical executive orders to fulfill his agenda.\n\nThe history of black workers in the Postal Service shows the kind of program that can transform African Americans' lives. A Bernie Sanders presidency would strengthen and expand that program, tying a service that all Americans need and use to the improved material conditions in the lives of the black workers who hold these jobs.\n\nPaul Prescod is a high school social studies teacher and member of the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Kelley (Liveright, 2023).\n\nWhen sixteen-year-old Minnie Savage boarded a train from Lee Mont, Virginia, to Philadelphia in 1918 with nothing more than a sandwich, she told no one of her plans. The promise of jobs and opportunity in the North was too enticing. And the conditions in Accomack County, Virginia, were especially difficult for a young black girl. Only a few years earlier, in 1907, a white mob had attacked the town's African-American neighborhood after rumors of black laborers' plans to demand better pay from prosperous white farmers.\n\nSavage found work in Philadelphia. But the North had its own challenges, including many that resembled life in the Jim Crow South. Shut out of most jobs in the city, Savage was forced to toil as a cleaner at a local drugstore. The work was grueling. Each day, she scrubbed the floor of the drugstore on her hands and knees.\n\nSavage's experience mirrored those of millions of other black people who left the South during the Great Migration. One of those traveling to the North was Bruce Murphy, historian Blair L. M. Kelley's grandfather. He arrived in Philadelphia around 1918, also from Accomack County.\n\nWeaving in her family history, Kelley's Black Folk: The Roots of the Black Working Class powerfully charts the course of the black working class from the era of slavery to the mid-twentieth century. While she acknowledges that no one book could capture the full depth and diversity of the black working class, Kelley's book is admirably sweeping in narrative and scope. By reclaiming the stories of black workers in the United States over centuries with richness and care, Kelley's Black Folk does justice to the memory and legacy of the countless black men and women who toiled in deplorable conditions to make a life for themselves and their loved ones.\n\nAnd as Kelley stresses, this is not solely a story about individual - or family - accomplishments. It is also a story about how the labor of black people - as workers and as freedom fighters - pushed the United States toward embracing democratic ideals. \"Their fights against racism and against labor exploitation,\" Kelley writes, \"were always one.\"\n\nKelley begins her narrative in the nineteenth century, when four million black people were enslaved in the United States. Through the life of her ancestor Henry Rucker, an enslaved blacksmith in Elbert County, Georgia, Kelley shows the significance of community formation as a survival tactic under a vicious system that denied black people's rights and personhood. As Kelley points out, these men and women found ways to sustain themselves by fashioning ties outside of the control of white slaveholders. During these years, Kelley argues, black people \"learned the basics of what it would be like to be part of a working class by earning at the margins of enslavement.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of slavery, black people were relegated to the most menial positions in US society. Sharecropping, which closely resembled slavery, left freed black men and women (as well as poor whites) in a seemingly never-ending cycle of debt and dependency. Laundry work - one of the most common occupations for black women, who made up 65 percent of the profession - was enormously taxing and poorly paid.\n\nYet black men and women resisted their exploitation, pushing for more autonomy and better conditions where they could. Kelley tells the story of Sarah Hill, a laundress living in Athens, Georgia, during the first half of the twentieth century, to highlight the important role of washerwomen in the years after the Civil War. Rather than submitting to demands that they work under supervision in white homes, black laundresses like Hill chose independence - they worked from their own homes, protecting them from further exploitation as well as the predations of white men.\n\nIn the most well-known act of resistance, black washerwomen joined together to contest working conditions and discrimination in Atlanta's 1881 washerwomen strike. In July of that year, twenty black women formed the Washing Society to advocate for better pay, respect, and less interference from white employers. The group quickly grew to over three thousand members with broad support among African Americans. The women maintained their solidarity in the face of arrests, reprisals, and attempts to break their control over the industry, demonstrating their ability to stand against municipal and business interests.\n\nKelley details other episodes in the long history of black working-class women's labor activism. She notes, for example, how black women joined other members of the working class in Richmond, Virginia, during a general strike in 1873. She details how African-American businesswoman and teacher Maggie Lena, a daughter of a washerwoman, organized a 1904 boycott there against segregated public transportation that \"bankrupted the city's main streetcar Cottrell Laurence Dellums company.\" Through these examples and many others, Kelley compellingly argues that black women have been key protagonists in the US working class.\n\nThe connection between black labor and the struggle for black citizenship rights is especially clear in Kelley's discussion of the Pullman porters. Recounting the story of, one of the organizers and leaders of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, Kelley shows how the Great Migration was \"a search for everyday dignity.\"\n\nAfter almost losing a brother in the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, Dellums decided to relocate from Corsicana, Texas, to San Francisco in 1922 and search for job opportunities. On the way, he met a Pullman porter on the train west who counseled him to get off in Oakland and provided him with directions to a home where he could stay. After first finding work on a steamship, Dellums secured a position as a Pullman porter in January 1924. Three years later, he was fired by the Pullman Company for his support of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters. This marked a turning point in his life: Dellums (the uncle of the late leftist congressman Ron Dellums ) soon became a full-time organizer for the union and ultimately a close ally of its leader, A. Philip Randolph.\n\nEstablished by Randolph in 1925, the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters was the first major twentieth-century union led by African Americans. Its members were workers at the Pullman Company, established by George Pullman in 1867. The nation's largest employer of African Americans, the Pullman Company maintained a racial hierarchy on passenger trains through a tiered labor force. White conductors were placed in positions of authority, while black porters provided service to passengers on the trains.\n\nThe Brotherhood challenged low wages as well as the dehumanizing working conditions of the porters. As Kelley explains, the efforts of Dellums, Randolph, and other porters not only paved the way for improved conditions at the Pullman company. They also helped to \"improve the lives of the Black working class writ large.\" What's more, the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters played a central role in the creation of a national movement against racial oppression - best exemplified through A. Philip Randolph's leadership of the 1940s March on Washington Movement and porter E. D. Nixon's crucial organizing in the 1955-56 Montgomery Bus Boycott.\n\nKelley's discussion of the Pullman porters provides a window into some of the intricacies of the black working class. As she explains, the Pullman porters may have been more educated and better paid than many other black workers of the period. Many even saw them as part of the middle class. But the economic exploitation they endured on Pullman cars, tinged with racism, placed them squarely in the working class. Within the segregated communities of the North and South, Kelley makes clear, a materialist definition of class cannot be divorced from race. While Black Folk is about the working class, its subject is living, breathing people rather than abstract categories.\n\nShe goes one step further to suggest that we also cannot ignore gender. The black domestic workers and maids who take center stage in the book - largely absent from public discourse, despite representing two-thirds of black women's employment in the workforce in 1930 - were denied federal protections and shouldered the negative stereotypes directed at black families. Isolated from their families through live-in arrangements, black domestic workers were more susceptible to labor exploitation as well as sexual assault.\n\nYet black women found ways to band together - on their commutes, in what little leisure time they had, through childcare, and through clubs, churches, and unions. Motivated by the belief that \"a broken America could be made better,\" Kelley argues that these women negotiated for better conditions and \"used what they had to craft a vision of what a better life could look like.\" Black workers continually recreated the communal ties and organizing potential that sustained a culture of resistance.\n\nIn the final section of the book, Kelley turns her attention to black postal carriers. Examining the lives of Hartford Boykin, his father Isaac, and William Harvey Carney Jr, Kelley describes how federal positions opened for black Americans after the Civil War in recognition of their military service, but decades of racial violence and Jim Crow tyranny led to the relegation of black civic workers.\n\nBlack postal workers responded by creating the National Alliance of Postal Employees - first for railway postal workers in 1913 and later, in 1923, for all black postal workers. According to Kelley, this organization provided a base for black postal carriers \"to center the fights of laboring men and women in broad calls for justice.\" The union also lent them a layer of protection against economic retaliation, making it possible for African-American postal workers in the 1940s to help organize voter registration drives in Alabama and Georgia, and protest segregation.\n\nWith rich storytelling and innovative research, Black Folk refutes popular conceptions of the worker as universally white and male, elevating the lives of those too often ignored in media and politics. These individuals, Kelley asserts, represent \"the canary in the coal mine\" for the dehumanization of all laborers under capitalism, while also modeling resistance. Black workers built on the traditions of previous generations and banded together to improve social and economic conditions - not only for themselves and for their families, but for all workers across the country.\n\nKeisha N.

Washington Area Spark / Flickr\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThere's a tendency these days to pit race against class.\n\nCracking down on Wall Street, Hillary Clinton famously proclaimed, won't end racism. Promoting a jobs program, Bernie Sanders's critics chided, won't stop racial profiling. Fighting economic exploitation, naysayers maintain, won't bludgeon the fortress of white supremacy.\n\nNone of this would have made much sense to the National Negro Congress (NNC). Founded in February 1936, the NNC sought to build a mass antiracist coalition rooted in the labor movement that could attack racial hierarchy and the economic exploitation that undergirded it. Their goal was nothing less than the evisceration of Jim Crow and the elevation of black Americans to \"first-class\" citizenship - fulfilling the dreams of an egalitarian, interracial democracy first glimpsed in the Reconstruction era .\n\nWeathering geopolitical machinations (which triggered a split in 1940), the NNC notched some notable victories before being done in by Cold War red-baiting. And despite its short life, the civil rights group has much to tell us about how to fight white supremacy.\n\nJacobin editor Shawn Gude recently caught up with Erik Gellman, historian and author of Death Blow to Jim Crow: The National Negro Congress and the Rise of Militant Civil Rights , to talk about the NNC's mass-based organizing and its relevance to struggles today for a \" Third Reconstruction .\"\n\nWhat was the National Negro Congress, and what was their strategy for challenging Jim Crow racism and racial hierarchy in the US?\n\nThe National Negro Congress was a civil rights organization that developed out of a conference at Howard University. That 1935 gathering featured a number of prominent black intellectuals and activists such as A. Philip Randolph , John P. Davis , and James Ford . The organization started in earnest with its first convening conference in Chicago in February 1936. Hundreds of delegates from different associations came together to foment what Richard Wright described at that gathering as a \"Negro Bill of Rights.\" In the midst of the Great Depression, they sought to devise new methods of racial advancement and to revive a radical strain of the Black Freedom Movement .\n\nThe NNC's leaders conceived of the Congress as an organization of organizations. There were a lot of groups in black communities nationwide, and they wanted to capture all of this energy in order to wield power as a formidable partner within the emerging Popular Front coalition of the late 1930s.\n\nHow was the NNC different from other civil rights groups?\n\nThey were much more interested in class dynamics. They thought that working-class, labor-based activism had more potential than the welfare capitalism or Garveyite black nationalism that dominated in the 1920s.\n\nAnother difference was their attention to international anticolonial and antiracist networks. They were alarmed at the spread of fascism around the world - the invasion of Ethiopia by Mussolini, the Spanish Civil War , and Hitler coming to power - and they believed that broad coalitions were necessary to fight fascism in all forms.\n\nThat strategy set them apart from groups like the NAACP or the Urban League, which sought more polite negotiations and favored the \" talented tenth \" approach of highlighting the most educated and elite African Americans. The NNC wanted to foment resistance from the working class.\n\nMore specifically, it placed black organizers in the emerging industrial union movement. It partnered with the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) to organize steel, packing, tobacco, auto, and other factory workers. The NNC and its southern youth offshoot, the Southern Negro Youth Congress (SNYC) also highlighted female leadership, with prominent activists such as Thelma Dale (Perkins) , Esther Cooper Jackson , Dorothy Burnham , Marie Richardson , and many others leading the charge in cultural, political, and economic campaigns, especially during the Second World War.\n\nWhat did they see as the connection between economic exploitation and racism in the US?\n\nThey thought that racism was the key divider of the labor movement in America. Racism not only kept African Americans from succeeding and thriving, but it prevented white workers from unionizing and achieving economic security.\n\nThey also saw several emerging opportunities to build a broader, class-based movement. The Popular Front, which was coming together in 1935, drew together many groups that were fighting for a more progressive and radical expansion of the New Deal. There was also a new union movement, the CIO, which advocated a broader industrial unionism. To the extent that \" civil rights unionism \" (a term employed by Robert Korstad ) did develop, the NNC's network was a key catalyst.\n\nThe NNC also reinterpreted American history by placing African Americans at the center rather than the margins. They argued that black workers were key agents of cooperative American values and protest traditions. In this interpretation, they appealed to the slave rebels , the role of African Americans in the Civil War, and the black-led democratic social movement of Reconstruction . They believed that this proud history justified their central role in the 1930s and 1940s in wielding a \"death blow to Jim Crow\" as a means to enact and expand American democracy.\n\nA generation of white supremacist propaganda had nearly obscured the interracial democracy that existed in the South during Reconstruction. The NNC took a lot of lessons from that political-social movement, and tried to apply it in their own era that also included a depression, war, and postwar reconstruction.\n\nWhat they hoped to do in the mid-to-late 1930s was to push the New Deal as far as they could to the left, enhancing democracy and even creating it anew, as their ally Langston Hughes famously illustrated in his poem \" Let American Be America Again .\" They thought that an activist federal government could regulate capitalism and put human rights ahead of property rights to ensure that the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth amendments of the Constitution worked for all Americans.\n\nThey certainly did not achieve the revolution they had envisioned. But some pieces of the Second New Deal of the mid-1930s, like the Wagner Act, the Resettlement Administration, and other government legislation and programs, were more progressive than the first wave of New Deal legislation. I think that this was the result of groups like the National Negro Congress catalyzing civil rights activities across the country and applying pressure from the left.\n\nWhat did the NNC's work look like on the ground? Their organizing focus and tactics really varied from chapter to chapter.\n\nI focused on six different locations where the NNC and SNYC were particularly active during their existence between 1936 and 1947. My book was the first to tackle the NNC, but should not be the last. Scores of local councils emerged across the nation, fomenting creative antiracist campaigns that should be further explored.\n\nI discovered that the NNC was different than, say, the NAACP, which functioned as a top-down organization. In some cases that organization even suspended local chapters' charters when national leaders disapproved of their actions. The NNC valued creativity in grassroots organizing. Antiracist activism developed in uneven ways across the country, and NNC activists in these places were given the leeway and autonomy to move in different directions.\n\nOne of my book's chapters, for example, examines the late 1930s Southern labor movement in Richmond. I found it fascinating that the Southern Negro Youth Congress organized tobacco workers' unions there well before the CIO even dared to organize black workers in the South. It showed me that black workers were at the vanguard of the Popular Front, which had great potential to break apart Jim Crow. But, as Ira Katznelson discusses in his book, Fear Itself , the \"southern cage\" of white supremacy was formidable, hampering the democratic potential of New Deal policies.\n\nLater chapters look at other dynamics. My chapter on World War II focuses on New York City, where activists led the way in navigating the political opportunities (such as electing Ben Davis to City Council and Adam Clayton Powell to Congress), but they also operated under limitations imposed by their allies during the Second World War. In those years, unions signed \"no strike\" pledges, and Communist Party leaders said, and I'm paraphrasing here, \"Don't do anything on race until the war is over.\" But yet the NNC, led by a dynamic group of black women, fomented new forms of antiracist activism, politics, and culture that reinvigorated the NNC to come out fighting as soon as the war ended.\n\nThe last chapter of the book delves into South Carolina, which was a very interesting location in these years. Between 1945 and about 1947, a black-led left-wing network there really did believe that they could kill Jim Crow. Before the Cold War had become entrenched, these activists possessed an optimism coming out of the war that democracy could be brought to the United States. They took an internationalist perspective, which explains why the NNC was the first African-American organization to petition the newly formed United Nations for human rights violations.\n\nI thought DC was a really fascinating case. The NNC there did some labor organizing, but because the city had less of an industrial base, it did a lot of anti-police violence work as well. You note in your book that in 1939, the Baltimore Afro-American reported that after the activism and the petition drives of the NNC, not one African American had been killed by the police in DC in the past year. That's pretty remarkable. And they also connected police violence to labor repression and strike busting. So at the same time they were fighting police violence against African Americans, they were also tying it to their efforts to craft a multiracial, labor-based coalition.\n\nThey connected the ideas of economic security and bodily autonomy, especially in DC, where black neighborhoods were carefully policed and segregated. They related these issues of racial violence to economic insecurity. They fostered a large coalition that connected police brutality to lynching, a strategy that challenged and ultimately angered Walter White of the NAACP.\n\nWhite conceived of the anti-lynching campaign more narrowly, negotiating with the Roosevelt administration and limiting the fight to a potential anti-lynching bill in Congress that ultimately failed. The NNC attacked anti-lynching as part of a wider frame, encompassing police brutality, debt peonage, and economic insecurity. John P. Davis referred to this as the \"lynch spirit\" because these forms of brutality intertwined to keep African Americans economically and socially impoverished.\n\nCan you talk about the NNC's split in 1940?\n\nAt the NNC's 1940 convention in Washington, John L. Lewis, then the head of the CIO, spoke in opposition to entering the war. Lewis was not a Communist, but he did not want another war fought by working-class men for what he determined was the benefit of corporations. John P. Davis, who had been the executive secretary and architect of the NNC since its inception, backed Lewis's demands, but more from a Communist-influenced perspective.\n\nTo put this moment in context, in 1939 the Soviet Union signed a Non-Aggression Pact with Germany. Almost overnight, Communists and some of their leftist allies begin to preach that getting involved in another world war would sacrifice working-class people for imperialist aims. Then protest politics changed dramatically in the other direction when Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, making for what I call \"ideological whiplash.\" After the second shift back to the Popular Front, Davis resigned as the head of the NNC.\n\nFor black leftists during this 1939-1941 period, charting a path forward and retaining these larger coalitions was complicated and confusing. While NNC president A. Philip Randolph had previously attacked others for red-baiting the NNC, by the 1940 conference he had become convinced that the organization had become too influenced by its principal allies - the CIO (and Lewis) but especially the Communist Party. As head of the AFL-affiliated Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, Randolph did not have a strong CIO allegiance. He was a Socialist Party stalwart going back to the First World War in New York, where he had a long history of sectarian fighting with Communists. The 1939 shift away from antifascism and the Popular Front convinced him to sever ties with them. As a result, Randolph resigned as president, and many socialists and liberals went with him. The NNC split apart in 1940.\n\nBut I argue that the split was not totally debilitating to either group. Randolph and his allies went on to lead the March on Washington Movement , whose chief achievement was to threaten a march of 100,000 black people on Washington. FDR blinked and issued Executive Order 8802, which led to the Fair Employment Practice Committee and opened up some wartime jobs to African Americans. Meanwhile, the NNC started working on its own campaign that paralleled Randolph's demand for war-industries jobs. They protested discrimination in large aircraft manufacturing plants in Baltimore and Los Angeles and opened up these and other war-industries jobs through campaigns of their own.\n\nIn short, the NNC and Randolph continued with vigor after 1940, but the tragedy of this split was that neither group was able to build the kind of mass movement that they had once dreamed of in the late 1930s.\n\nCan you talk about the demise of the NNC? It's really a story about the advent of the Cold War.\n\nThe Cold War was not inevitable in the form it took. It was only by 1947 when its network got pushed on the defensive and allies abandoned them that they started falling apart as an organization.\n\nThe government listed the NNC and SNYC as \"Communist Front\" organizations and proceeded to harass, deport, and even jail its members. And the group's main allies - the Communists and the CIO - reacted in ways that further compromised them. The CIO decided to go along with the anticommunism in the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act . Its leader, Phil Murray, issued a directive that forbid unions to work with the NNC, among other groups. As a result, NNC members became cut off from the very industrial union movement they had helped build just ten years earlier.\n\nAnd then the Communist Party, rather than trying to retain a Popular Front coalition-type politics, decided to go in a more sectarian direction and sent key black leaders underground. In my view, this strategy was self-defeating, because small \"c\" communists, fellow travelers, and mid-level black CP members got exposed and traumatized by the House Un-American Activities Committee as well as other local anticommunist groups.\n\nThelma Dale Perkins, an NNC leader whom I interviewed for the book, said that one day in 1947 she realized that the organization could not survive. She personally carted all the NNC records over to the Schomburg library in Harlem because she knew that would be the only place where they would be protected rather than used as evidence by McCarthyites or destroyed by the very activists who worked with the NNC out of fear of persecution.\n\nOverall, what were the successes and failures of the NNC? And what lessons does the organization have for current struggles against racism and exploitation?\n\nThe key to the NNC is to understand that these people believed that they would destroy Jim Crow in their own generation. That's important, because historians have often treated the thirties and forties as the \"prelude to the Civil Rights Movement.\" But these radicals were not saying among themselves, \"You know, we're going to build the seedbed for the next generation to come along and get the job done.\"\n\nThey did not accomplish the goal of destroying Jim Crow, and there are many reasons why, but to conclude that they failed elides what they accomplished in their own time. In many ways, they undermined the ideological underpinnings of Jim Crow in the North and the West and to some degree in the South. They fostered a new militant black culture and experimented with forms of street-based mass protest politics. They also helped propel a generation of black union workers into stable blue-collar jobs. And their conception of \"civil rights,\" a term just emerging in their era, as based on economic security and human rights, left behind an important model, especially since the 1950s-1960s movement at first submerged these concepts as priorities.\n\nAnd despite Cold War red-baiting, connections remained between this 1930s-1940s generation and the generation of civil rights activists that followed. As one anecdotal example, the SNYC in Alabama included Sallye Davis, whose young daughter, Angela Davis, grew up in this context. These connections are not just coincidences.\n\nThe NNC was also an interesting group because of its attempts to try to organize an organization of organizations. It sought to build broad, black-led antiracist coalitions, and in building them, to push them to become more militant. Its story is instructive in our own era of tremendous economic and racial inequality. Groups have emerged to combat these issues, but they may need to work in broader coalitions to achieve their goals.\n\nOverall, I think the New Deal and Second World War era was a really creative period for protest politics both culturally and politically. I think activists today should learn from its victories as well as the mistakes that limited its impact. Just as people in the NNC saw Reconstruction as a key period, today we might look back to the protest politics of the late 1930s and '40s, which speak urgently to our contemporary problems. Police brutality, economic inequality, and fascist ideas and policies were endemic in 1939, and they're endemic in 2019.\n\nErik Gellman is an associate professor of history at the University of North Carolina and the author of Death Blow to Jim Crow: The National Negro Congress and the Rise of Militant Civil Rights .\n\nShawn Gude is Jacobin 's associate editor.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nOver the last five years, Black Lives Matter has served as a broad banner uniting citizens from all walks of life against the most egregious and visible use of police force against black civilians. Until the election of Donald Trump, who made his \" Blue Lives Matter \" commitments well-known from the very moment he announced his candidacy, popular demonstrations against police killings spread like prairie fires across the country from Oakland to Ferguson, Missouri, and on to Baltimore, Chicago, Dallas, and Baton Rouge. As a rallying cry, Black Lives Matter opened up public space for disparate campaigns, networks of grieving families, criminal justice reform organizations, and localized struggles against the carceral state that had been in motion for decades.\n\nAt the same time, however, like most great slogans, #BlackLivesMatter advanced a rather straightforward, if not simplistic analysis of the issue at hand, that the problems of policing were primarily racial. Black Lives Matter fervor also unleashed a torrent of historical misinformation, conspiracy theory, and wrong-headed thinking about politics. In elevating a race-centric interpretation of American life and history, Black Lives Matter has actually had the effect of making it more difficult to think critically and honestly about black life as it exists, in all of its complexity and contradictions. Rather than clearing a path through the thickets, some left intellectuals have made peace with this overgrowth of bad historical thinking, even though it threatens to choke out the possibility for cultivating the kind of critical left analyses of society we so desperately need.\n\nMia White's \"In Defense of Black Sentiment,\" offers criticism of my 2017 Catalyst essay , \"The Panthers Can't Save Us Now: Anti-Policing Struggles and the Limits of Black Power,\" and Kim Moody's \"Cedric Johnson and the Other Sixties' Nostalgia\" addresses that essay, and my more recent New Politics essay, \"Who's Afraid of Left Populism?\" I appreciate that both White and Moody have taken time to craft responses to my work. I first came to know White as part of a growing, dedicated community of scholars researching the 2005 Hurricane Katrina disaster and the long process of reconstruction and recovery that followed. White's work stood out because of its focus on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, often neglected by the urban-studies bias towards the plight of New Orleans. I've never met Moody, but during the aughts, when my economist colleague Chris Gunn and I routinely co-taught a labor course at Hobart and William Smith Colleges, Moody's writings on American working-class history were instrumental in shaping our approach to the course, and were a mainstay of our assigned readings. His 1997 book Workers in a Lean World was especially helpful for making sense of the painful impact of globalized production on the once-bustling manufacturing towns surrounding us in Western New York.\n\nWhile I think we are all on the same side politically, and there are definite points of agreement between our essays, White and Moody rehearse some errant arguments about race, politics, and class power that have become orthodoxy on the contemporary left. In what follows, I want to contest some of their core claims regarding the character of black political life, the role of contemporary policing in managing surplus population, New Deal social democracy, and African American progress, and finally, the relationship between electoral politics, the Democratic Party, and the future of the American left.\n\nBoth authors abide some version of Black Lives Matter sensibility, sharing a suspicion of class-conscious politics as always reproducing racial disparities historically and into the future. My central contention with both White and Moody lies in their reluctance to engage in meaningful class analysis of black political life. Their use of clichés and anachronisms when addressing black life reflects a broader affliction of the contemporary left. This difficulty in discussing black life in a critical-historical manner filters out and contaminates interpretations of labor and capital, and ultimately undermines strategic political thinking.\n\nAt the start of his essay, Moody says that he \"will not attempt to present a different analysis of 'black exceptionalism,'\" but in fact, his and White's essays are both defenses of black exceptionalism, the very interpretative and discursive sensibility that I have criticized in recent writings. Black political life is and always has been heterogeneous, a complex of shifting ideological positions and competing interests. Black political life has always been shaped by broader conflicts between labor and capital, even in the contexts where black noncitizen or second-class-citizen status was the norm. When White and Moody turn to black political life, however, these basic empirical-historical facts of African American political development are minimized, or vanish altogether. This is not a new problem.\n\nIn his 1962 essay, \"Revolutionary Nationalism and the Afro-American,\" Harold Cruse complained \"American Marxists cannot 'see' the Negro at all unless he is storming the barricades, either in the present or in history.\" The World War II veteran and ex-communist partisan put the matter even more bluntly saying that American Marxists - his euphemism for his former party comrades - wrongly view blacks as \"a people without classes or differing class interests.\" Cruse also denounced the falsehood of the \"Negro Liberation Movement\" a favored term of his left contemporaries, as an \"'all-class' affair united around a program of civil and political equality ...\" I don't evoke Cruse here because I think he had all the answers to what ails us - the same is true for my discussion of Bayard Rustin below. Cruse is frustrated by the oversimplifications and occlusions of African American life and history he has witnessed within the Communist Party. From this acknowledgement of a more complex, class-stratified world beyond the desks of Herbert Aptheker and his old CP comrades, Cruse pivots towards a defense of a revolutionary black leadership. What he desires is that the black bourgeoisie act as a truly national bourgeoisie. Setting aside the problems of this argument, which Cruse would enlarge in his 1967 book The Crisis of the Negro Intellectual , his basic criticism of the Left may be as insightful today as it was when he first wrote it.\n\nIn the age of Black Lives Matter protests, many activists and academics seem unable to see the complexity of black life beyond the barricades, or outside the frame of the latest viral video killing of a black civilian. Neither White nor Moody engage in much substantive discussion of actually-existing black political life, the fact of differing black class interests, and the fundamental demographic and cultural changes within black life and American society of the last half-century. While White attempts to marshal normative theory and autoethnography to build a case for a redemptive black power sensibility, Moody either explains away class conflict among blacks as inconsequential, or assumes the familiar, deferential posture of white New Leftists towards the \"self organization of the oppressed.\"\n\nIn both cases, their prose remains lodged in the literary conventions emerging from decades-gone social conditions. White's essay rehearses black power sentiment, the black population as a socially coherent and unified political constituency deriving from twentieth-century conditions of black ghettoization and Jim Crow segregation. Moody's essay, on the other hand, recalls New Left anxieties and attempts to navigate the spatial and cultural gulf between the mid-twentieth-century urban black ghetto and the expanding white suburban middle class and its deepening commitments to capitalism.\n\nWhite employs the racial \"we\" to drive her analysis, and throughout she engages in a form of ventriloquism that has long been a problem within black political life and scholarly and popular interpretations thereof. \"We are still where we are, surveilled and killed while walking, breathing, doing our jobs, leaving a vacation, visiting friends, or driving a car,\" White writes, \"Thus, to ask Black readers to shrug off race as a central analytic is to ask them to 1) do what they already do on a regular basis to survive as good liberal subjects as if they don't, and 2) pretend that the very reason survival is so fraught has nothing to do with the same reason we are ignored as an electorate.\"\n\nAside from how the second half of her statement mischaracterizes the intent and conclusions of my argument, there are two immediate problems with this passage. First, while her use of the first-person plural has dramatic impact, it obscures the actual dynamics of police killings, advancing the falsehood that all blacks regardless of class position are equally likely to be victims of daily surveillance, harassment, detainment, and arrest. White abides the popular New Jim Crow accounting of the carceral state as fundamentally racist in motives and effects, but this is hyperbolic and misleading. Blacks are disproportionately represented among the victims of arrest-related incidents in most years since the start of this century, but blacks are not the majority of victims. As I argued in the 2017 Catalyst essay and recent New Politics essay, contemporary policing has a class character that is not reflected in viral videos, which only capture some police-civilian conflicts and are circulated through social media networks and practices that are governed by standing assumptions and ideological predispositions of users and their social and psychological needs, often at the expense of other evidence like national Justice Department statistics, killings undocumented by cell phone camera, and deaths that do not conform to the New Jim Crow frame. The blackness of the victims is visible, evocative, and foregrounded in popular understandings of why they were targeted, their common position among the most submerged elements of the working class is not as readily legible for some audiences.\n\nSecond, this use of the racial \"we\" preempts politics, and by that I am not simply referring to the arena of elections and party politics as White implies, but the broader contexts where social power is mobilized and contested. The very real diversity of black experiences and political sentiments of the carceral state are lost in White's essay, and in much Black Lives Matter discourse, both of which retreat into abstraction. In other words, black people do not merely interface with police departments as suspects and offenders, but also as crime victims, lawyers, witnesses, public defenders, social workers, judges, corrections officers, probation officers, beat cops, city administrators, and wardens, especially in cities like Baltimore, Washington D.C., Chicago, and others with sizable black populations. White's defense of black sentiment, against my critique, forces these differences out of view, and gives the impression that all blacks, \"we,\" view the problems of crime and punishment in the same ways, and are ready to prioritize the same raft of solutions. In fact, she concludes, \"the well-being of Blacks always also requires-as a means to attend to accumulating, historical, unfair disadvantage-a collective sense of Black self-determination.\" This view that the black population constitutes a cohesive political constituency with commonly held interests was not true during the Jim Crow era, and it is certainly not a useful way of thinking about black political life now.\n\nBlack life was complex under Jim Crow segregation, albeit cramped by de jure and social constraints imposed on black political will in the North and South. Black political life was and is animated by competing interests and different visions of what society should be. Such dynamics took on a unique character in different epochs given the broad experience of slavery and Jim Crow segregation, but the fact of noncitizen or second-class-citizenship status did not generate a unified set of aspirations and interests among blacks, even if some projected the sense of common black passions and strivings to suit their particular interests as black leaders (or scholars), white benefactors, or white supremacists.\n\nThe black population has experienced profound demographic and political changes since the fifties. Poverty has decreased since the landmark 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision, which overturned the \"separate but equal\" precedent on which the Jim Crow edifice stood, from the plight of the vast majority of blacks to the experience of roughly a quarter of the black population. The black middle class expanded after World War II, and black integration into mass culture as consumers and producers, integration in higher education, employment, corporations, the nonprofit world, and public sector employment was spurred by omnibus civil rights legislation as well as opportunities provided by New Deal, Fair Deal, and Great Society programs. In many locales black governance became a reality. By the late 1980s, the three largest American cities elected black mayors, and by then, the presence of black mayors and black city council majorities were the norm wherever there was a sizable black electorate. These changes were the consequence of popular pressure and the public policy it produced, the initiatives of the New Deal Democratic coalition and the Johnson White House.\n\nSomehow in our contemporary moment, the New Deal coalition has been recast as the villains of history. However, that narrative, now orthodox among many on the Left, silences the actually existing historical voices and experiences of blacks who benefitted from, supported, and fought to expand the policies of the New Deal, Fair Deal, and Great Society periods. Even worse still, this narrative breeds cynicism, leaving us with a wrong-headed view of the political process, and what the Left might do now, under very different social and political conditions, to abolish poverty, decommodify housing, health care, transportation, education, and other basic needs, and expand popular democratic power within the economic realm - all of which, like the eradication of police brutality would disproportionately, though not solely, benefit black citizens. It does not take much thought to conclude that the form of social democracy produced by the New Deal coalition was limited, especially compared to other industrialized nations, but it takes a particular type of bad faith to conclude that the horizon of contemporary left aspirations should be limited by the history of the New Deal.\n\nThe sheer size of the black population today should in and of itself render such talk of \"black self-organization\" and \"black sentiment\" obsolete. At nearly 46 million, the black population in the US is greater than the population of Canada, three times the size of the population of Greece, and slightly larger than the combined population of Oceania (i.e., Australasia, Melanesia, Polynesia, and Micronesia). Why are so many incapable of thinking about the black population with the same complexity they would afford those populations? To his credit, Moody does briefly acknowledge the fact of different class interests among blacks, but he does not provide the kind of historical-materialist analysis that you might expect from someone who has dedicated most of his adult life to the study of class struggle. Despite his posturing about the \"right to black self-organization\" it is interesting that when Moody encounters such self-activity in all its contradictory, historical motion, he has difficulty realizing its import. Rather than a full-bodied class analysis of black political life, his claims instead resemble the more familiar culturalist arguments of class from the Black Power lectern. In other words, all the black elites are either dupes or sellouts, the black working class and poor are victims, and somewhere, lurking around the historical corner is the revolutionary black subject waiting to be born.\n\nMoody recognizes the \"contradictory and even reactionary role\" of black elites in shaping punishment policy, only to shrug off their influence, concluding they played \"most certainly a subordinate role in terms of federal and state policy and practice.\" Here Moody mischaracterizes the actual dynamics of the carceral build-up, a process that took place largely at the local and state level, the very contexts where black political power and mobilization mattered. The role of black public officials within the contexts of cities like Washington D.C., Detroit, New Orleans, and elsewhere was anything but subordinate. Subordinate to whom? Moody misses the very powerful role that these black elites played and continue to play in formal party politics and local economic growth regimes, in legitimating neoliberalization and, at times, insulating such forces from criticism even when they embark on policy decisions that will have negative social consequences for black constituencies.\n\nMore troubling, Moody diminishes the role that various black constituencies, neighborhood groups, landlords, business owners, clergy, educators, and activists, not simply political elites, played in shaping the carceral expansion. The sense of different subject positions among blacks, which cannot be reduced simply to the \"petty bourgeoisie\" and the \"long struggle for black freedom\" as Moody does, is totally lost. Moody refers to the demands of working-class blacks for more police protection and tougher crime policy, but in a manner that returns quickly to the victim narrative, disconnecting their conscious actions as citizens from their unintended consequence, mass incarceration . James Forman, Jr , Michael Javen Fortner , and Donna Murch among others have provided a more useful sense of how these processes unfolded in real time and space, and the different motives that animated distinct black political choices.\n\nThere were liberal and progressive blacks and whites in Washington D.C. who supported decriminalization of marijuana and a handgun ban, and black nationalist community activists who opposed both measures. We would never know these details that if we adhere to Moody's generalizations about black life. More importantly, black opposition to both of those measures, policies which most urban dwellers would champion as progressive today, actually mattered. The legislation was defeated, marijuana arrests over the next few decades contributed mightily to the carceral expansion, and the proliferation of handguns made the District of Columbia one of the most dangerous cities in the US.\n\nAs my comrade, Adolph Reed, Jr has cautioned, \"taxonomy is not critique.\" Merely addressing the alleged excesses and missteps of black elites, without much concern for what class means in daily lives, organizational contexts, and real political fights cannot stand in for serious analysis of how black life is organized in myriad ways, like that of all other Americans, by the processes of production and realization of surplus value. A first basic step in a critical-left analysis is acknowledging the actual forces at play within black political life, rather than falling back on Black Power rhetorical formulas. These problems in Moody's essay come into even sharper relief when he attempts to defend the liberal racial justice frame.\n\nThis is my eleventh year of being shoveled into every major prison in the most populous state in the nation, and the largest prison system in the world .... Hidden are the facts that, at each institution I've been in, 30 to sometimes 40 percent of those held are black, and every one of the many thousands I've encountered was from the working or lumpenproletariat class.\n\nThe argument that contemporary policing in the United States is fundamentally about managing relative surplus population has been advanced by neo-Marxist and socialist thinkers over the last fifty years from George Jackson's prison writings to Stuart Hall et al.'s Policing the Crisis , and Ruth Gilmore's Golden Gulag among others. 1 Although they do not employ a Marxist analytical framework, other critical social scientists have drawn similar conclusions regarding the class character of mass incarceration. Loïc Wacquant's notions of the hyperghetto and hyperincarceration focus on submerged segments of the black urban population who are most heavily targeted by police and most likely to be incarcerated. In a similar vein, Brett Story critically engages the concept of the \"million-dollar block,\" which denotes the spatially concentrated origins of the nation's 2.3 million prisoners in a handful of dense urban neighborhoods that are the target of massive state investments in policing and incarceration. All of the aforementioned works acknowledge very visible racial inequalities, and begin from a basic sense of racial justice as a cherished political value. What they also share, however, is a more discerning interpretation of which portions of the black population have borne the brunt of the carceral expansion, and what those segments share with similarly situated prisoners, parolees, and ex-offenders across ethnic and racial groups.\n\nThinking about mass incarceration in terms of surplus population helps us to name precisely those who are most regularly surveilled and harassed by police, and who are the most likely to have their livelihoods as ex-offenders determined by the long reach of the carceral state. Unlike the New Jim Crow framing, discussing relative surplus population focuses our attention on which portions of the black population are most likely to be subject to intensive surveillance and policing. Although many blacks experience racial profiling in policing practices and in retail consumer contexts, class is a much more powerful determinant of who is actually arrested, assigned a public defender, convicted, sentenced, and incarcerated.\n\nMoody notes that the carceral state is \"very selective of which white people are most likely to be arrested, tried and incarcerated.\" These same selective dynamics, however, are at play across other US populations including African Americans. Blacks are disproportionately represented among those who are arrested, convicted, incarcerated, and under court supervision because blacks are still disproportionately represented among the nation's poor. Hence, if poor neighborhoods and communities are overpoliced, then it is no wonder as Moody notes that \"blacks are almost six times and Latinos three times more likely to be sentenced to 'hard time' in prison than whites.\"\n\nI have never denied these racial disparities, but what I have argued instead is that these racial disparities regarding policing and incarceration mirror the demography of the most vulnerable segments of the working class. Moody pins the disproportionate sentencing of blacks and Latinos to prison time compared to whites on discrimination, but without much consideration of other underlying dynamics. Namely, he neglects how poverty and the compulsory use of underfunded and overextended public defender's offices produce the kinds of disproportionality in conviction rates across race. What appears as racial disparity is underneath it all, a function of class power and dispossession. By focusing on the broader problem of relative surplus population, we might well connect these discussions of mass incarceration to the broader problems of capitalist society, as well as make common cause with the millions of overpoliced Americans who do not fit into a Black Lives Matter framework. In other words, the problem of mass incarceration as we know it is not an aberration, but rather a constitutive part of governing in the aftermath of welfare-state liberalism.\n\nIn an odd interpretative move for a veteran labor historian, Moody seizes on employment status at the time of arrest as though that moment tells us all we need to know about the lives of this segment of the working class. Moody offers a rather selective reading of incarceration statistics, one guided by an understanding of class that seems closer to behavioralist social science than historical materialism. He contends that those who are sentenced to prison are not primarily drawn from the surplus population. To evidence this point he refers to a study by the National Center for Education Statistics, although the full citation for this study is not provided. Moody reports \"nearly two-thirds of the prison population were employed prior to incarceration. 49% of all prisoners were employed full-time and another 16% in part-time work before entering prison, while another 8% were students, retired, or permanently disabled.\" Moody then notes \"only 19% of prisoners in 2014 were unemployed at the time of incarceration.\"\n\nThe statistics that Moody attributes to the National Center for Education Statistics were drawn from a 2014 survey conducted by the Program for International Assessment of Adult Competencies, a research initiative of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development that assesses literacy and skill levels for workforce development. That survey was taken between February and June 2014 and included 1,315 inmates - 1,048 males and 267 females. I am not sure why Moody chose this data when there are other sources that provide decidedly fuller and more rigorous portraits of the pre-arrest experiences of those who are incarcerated. 2 I am also not as confident as Moody that we can make useful generalizations from this sample, one that was drawn from a selection of prisons. This is especially a concern regarding any conclusions about women, who constitute a fast-growing incarcerated population. Most importantly, we should not make historical generalizations about carceral dynamics that have taken shape slowly and unevenly across the country over the last half-century based on one year's worth of data, no matter how fulsome it might be. Like so much analysis in this vein, complexity and context, be it within black political life or in the differing policies of states ranging from Louisiana to Minnesota, seem to fall away in favor of easy moralism. Still, there are bigger interpretive problems here with both this particular use of employment statistics to discuss class, and his sense of the argument we have made regarding relative surplus population and policing.\n\nAs Moody well knows, class is not merely a matter of employment or income, but rather it is more fundamentally about the social relations of production. The relative surplus population, or \"reserve army\" as Marx developed the concept, cannot be reduced to latter-day metrics of unemployment. Class is set in historical motion, and the reserve army represents a relative, contingent condition of the working class, rather than an ascriptive status. Marx denoted four fluid layers of the reserve army, a floating reserve of the temporarily employed, a latent segment made up of those not actively looking for work, but who may be mobilized to meet capital's shifting valorization requirements, a stagnant portion of those with \"extremely irregular\" employment, and lastly, the sphere of pauperism , which is the \"hospital of active labor-army and the dead weight of the industrial reserve army.\" These populations are not fixed, but rather their composition is expanding and contracting relative to the dictates of capital's need for living labor.\n\nEmployment status at the time of arrest is only part of the story in the lives of those governed through incarceration. For too many, it is after their sentence has been served that the real work of management of surplus population begins. The prospects of gainful employment for ex-offenders is greatly diminished by the combined force of the social stigma and discrimination they face, mandatory conviction self-reporting on job and college admissions applications, and the denial of access to public relief, unemployment insurance, and housing assistance in some states. 3\n\nEx-offenders are also compelled to take low-wage work to meet the requirements and avoid punishment under an elaborate, manipulative probation system. 4 In their empirically rich study of the ex-offender employability crisis, Jamie Peck and Nick Theodore focused on Chicago's majority black, west side neighborhoods of North Lawndale, East and West Garfield Park, and Austin, which are home to the highest concentrations of returning ex-offenders in the nation. They conclude that upon returning home to Chicago ex-offenders face a \"profoundly inhospitable labor market.\" Moreover, Peck and Theodore contend \"the prison system has become a labor market institution of considerable significance ... configuring prevailing definitions of employability, shaping the social distribution of work and wages, prefiguring the terms under which different segments of the contingent labor supply enter the job market, and shaping their relative bargaining power.\"\n\nA growing swell of policy activism has been dedicated to toppling these barriers to economic mobility facing formerly incarcerated persons. Such political efforts have borne some fruit in recent years, with many states passing \"ban the box\" legislation, ending mandatory self-reporting of prior convictions on job applications and college admissions, but critics rightly argue these policies do not go far enough to eliminate discrimination against ex-offenders. The fact remains that the carceral state contributes greatly to the reproduction of the industrial reserve, and in a manner that is intimately connected to the postindustrial urban economies.\n\nMoody lifts my discussion of policing surplus population out of the context of the gentrifying city, missing the ways that aggressive policing is central to urban real estate development and the tourism-entertainment sector growth, both of which serve as central economic drivers in the contemporary landscape. Moody seems to forget that since the late eighties and the accelerated, broad adoption of zero-tolerance strategies, the overwhelming resources of contemporary policing are dedicated to the routine surveillance, targeting, arrest, and prosecution of those whose activities are a means of basic survival and who are only nominally or infrequently employed in the formal wage economy. Much of routine policing activity is focused on regulating criminalized forms of work - panhandling, busking, sex work, the drug trade, property crime, operating as an unlicensed vendor, the illegal trade in stolen merchandise, and to be frank, robbery, and mugging, keeping in mind that slightly more than half of the incarcerated were convicted of violent offenses. There is also ample evidence that such deployments of more aggressive policing tactics are meted out in explicitly segregative ways that maintain the class order, insuring perpetual accumulation on one hand by defending middle-class and affluent consumer spaces, tourism districts, office parks, and gentrifying neighborhoods, and on the other, regulating the poor, homeless, so-called \"disconnected youth,\" noncitizen workers, and criminalized forms of work. 5\n\nFinally, Moody's defense of the New Jim Crow sensibility neglects recent and well-publicized trends in carceral demography, changes that further erode the claim that the carceral expansion of the last four decades was primarily driven by racial disparity in anti-drug policy. Between 2000 and 2015, the black male incarceration rate dropped by more than 24 percent, while rates for white men climbed slightly. During the same period, the incarceration rate for black women declined by nearly 50 percent, while the inverse was true for white women, who experienced a 53 percent increase.\n\nThis is progress on the racial justice front, perhaps a consequence of the sharpening public debate and intensity of local and state-level organizing. Yet at the same time, such changes are a reminder that the carceral state's underlying motives are not fully captured in slogans like the \"New Jim Crow\" or \"Black Lives Matter.\" A dogged fixation on racial disparities only provides a narrow window on the carceral crisis. That is a window that we are familiar with, it connects rather easily to liberal interpretations of American society and organizing strategies that survived the Cold War, while other modes of working-class analysis and social action were criminalized and eviscerated. Shifting our attention to the problem of relative surplus population allows us to see the connections between the plight of black teenagers from Chicago's \"wild hundreds\" arrested for their part in a \"flash mob\" robbery of a Magnificent Mile clothing store, and that of a white middle-aged mother, her son, and his live-in girlfriend who are arrested for selling OxyContin in their small town in southern Missouri. Marxist analyses of mass incarceration should be able to account for such situated experiences of the working class in the post-Fordist economy.\n\nWhite and Moody advance and enlarge popular fictions about New Deal social democracy and its racial limitations that have become new orthodoxies on the American left. And true to form, their attempts to root out the limitations of the New Deal silence black citizens' historical responses to New Deal policy, reflected in part by the large-scale migration of black voters into the Democratic Party ranks from the Depression onwards. \"The benefits of universal programs such as the New Deal,\" White declares, \"cannot be misremembered as materially transforming for the better the lives of the most marginalized Black Americans.\"\n\nWhite contends, \"the New Deal is widely critiqued for failing Black people, specifically because most New Deal Programs discriminated against Blacks, authorized separate and lower pay scales for Blacks, refused outright to support Black Applicants (for example the Federal Housing Authority refused to guarantee mortgages for Blacks who tried to buy in white neighborhoods), and the Civilian Conservation Corps maintained segregated camps.\" She then turns to the familiar claim that the farm and domestic worker exemptions of the 1935 Social Security Act are irrefutable evidence of the racist limitations of the New Deal policy legacy. 6 This is a falsehood repeated so many times that it is now widely accepted as true.\n\nSouthern Democrats certainly sought to exclude black workers from protections, as historian Touré Reed argues ; however, \"the most obvious problem with the claim is that it ignores the fact that the majority of sharecroppers, tenant farmers, mixed farm laborers and domestic workers in the early 1930s were white.\" Some 11.4 million whites were employed as agricultural laborers and domestics compared to 3.5 million blacks. As such, Reed reminds us, the Social Security exemptions excluded 27 percent of all white workers nationally. As an historical explanation of the New Deal's limitations, the Jim-Crowing of national social policy thesis does not hold up nor is it based in the preponderance of actual research by historians themselves. Rather, the power of particular capitalist blocs prevailed, in this case the landed interests represented by the Farm Bureau, insuring the vulnerability of the most submerged and dispossessed workers.\n\nThis New Deal mythology also wipes clean the record of black support and influence over the subsequent trajectory of Roosevelt-era reforms, and those pursued after the Second World War. There is little mention in their account of the massive public works programs that employed thousands of blacks, namely the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCCs) or the Works Progress Administration (WPA). These public works projects were publicly funded and publicly managed, employing millions of Americans from all walks of life. The CCC workers built roads and bridges, refurbished portions of the Appalachian Trail, and developed numerous public amenities of the US parks service.\n\nThere was no doubt discrimination in the CCC program. Black enrollment was capped at 10 percent of total enrollment, which mirrored the black proportion of the national population. As Nick Taylor points out, this level of CCC employment did not meet the high demand for relief among African Americans who were especially hard hit by the Depression. White nevertheless overreaches in claiming that all CCCs were segregated. In the Deep South CCC camps were segregated, sadly in conformity with the Jim Crow order, but beyond the Mason-Dixon line, many CCC work camps were integrated. All told, between 1933-1941, some 250,000 blacks were enrolled in the Corps.\n\nLuther Wandall summed up his experience in the CCC this way in the pages of Crisis Magazine: \"On the whole, I was gratified rather than disappointed with the CCC. I had expected the worst. Of course, it reflects, to some extent, all the practices and prejudices of the U. S. Army. But as a job and an experience, for a man who has no work, I can heartily recommend it.\" Wandall's comments, which are unsentimental and critical, and the scores of similar testimonies by other black men and boys who joined the CCC camps, should caution us against interpreting the meaning of New Deal social policies for its historical constituencies against the din of contemporary debates and preoccupations. There is a parallel dissonance between the actual experience of the G.I. Bill's educational and training provisions by black servicemen nationally, and contemporary efforts to impugn the policy as evidence of meta-historical white supremacy. 7\n\nIn the case of the WPA, it undertook a range of projects that provided work and income to millions of Americans, who were employed in the construction of public buildings, public art, music and theater projects, literacy programs, and the development of tourist guides for every state in the union. In 1935, blacks constituted around 15 percent of the WPA workforce, some 350,000, at least in raw numbers disproportionately benefitting from the program vis-à-vis whites. Ironically enough, many black writers who are now canonized by contemporary antiracist liberals, writers like Dorothy West, Richard Wright, Margaret Walker, and Zora Neale Hurston to name a few, were employed through the Federal Writers Project. Likewise, one significant but forgotten achievement of the WPA was the oral history project undertaken by John Lomax and Sterling Brown that collected the stories of hundreds of antebellum slavery's survivors, by then in their eighties and nineties, providing us with a priceless audio archive of their perspectives on bondage and freedom. These clearly antiracist dimensions of the New Deal are buried underneath convenient and often errant readings of the motives behind certain policies, their implications for black citizens, and the actual responses from black publics who lived and worked in the context.\n\nIt should be noted as well, that thousands of black workers were unionized in the steel mills, automotive plants, packinghouses, and ports across the US. during the Depression, World War II, and after because of the right to collective bargaining under the Wagner Act. 8 The wages they earned in these industries, and in many cases their unions themselves, became the key economic bulwark of the later Civil Rights Movement.\n\nMore evidence of the complex relationship between black popular struggles and the Roosevelt administration can be seen in the passage of Executive Order 8802. This measure desegregated the defense industries drawing thousands of blacks into the wartime workforce and was signed under the threat of a national protest, the original \" March on Washington \" movement organized by black trade unionist A. Philip Randolph.\n\nIn attempting to characterize it as a type of \"identity politics,\" Moody misreads the context of A. Philip Randolph's leadership of the original March on Washington movement. Moody contends that Randolph and Rustin were committed to black self-organization, but this is a rather superficial and anachronistic reading of the historical moment and the choices Randolph made in his attempt to desegregate the defense industries. Moody refers to Randolph rather dismissively as a \"self-proclaimed socialist\" before claiming that the planned March on Washington, and later formations such as the Negro American Labor Council, represent commitments to \"identity politics\" before the term came into existence. \"Was this 'identity politics' without the label?\" Moody asks, \"Or was it the recognition that in the struggle for black freedom and equality black self-organization was an indispensable tool even (or perhaps particularly) where unity and solidarity with whites was expected as in the labor movement but often denied?\"\n\nThe simple answer is no, it was not identity politics. Randolph was clear in his opposition to the most nationalistic styles of politics among blacks, as evidenced in his vocal support for the \"Garvey must go\" campaign. Moody's reliance on the white New Left and more contemporary radical fetish of black self-organization also gets in the way of useful interpretation of this moment. Of course, Randolph demanded full black participation, and crisscrossed the nation to stoke black citizen commitments, precisely because the black population was an expanding bloc of the Democratic Party coalition. It was the New Deal after all that began the process of black exodus from the Party of Lincoln. Somehow, Moody glosses this important fact of national political context and why it would be important for Randolph and his allies to prepare for a strong show of force of the emerging black electorate. For the record, whether the Left should acknowledge black self-organization or not is someone else's battle, one with origins in the white New Left's nearly pathological search for political relevancy and authentic revolutionary subjecthood as they stood uneasily between concomitant black political struggles in the fifties and sixties, and the growing social conservatism that accompanied the expansion of the mostly white, suburban middle class.\n\nPublic works projects, black workers' participation in union struggles, and the desegregation of the defense industries altered public perceptions about race and gender equality, brought Americans from different backgrounds into real and often unprecedented contact with one another, and presaged the expansion and new assertiveness of civil rights campaigns after the war. These reforms also meant real, tangible improvements in the lives of millions of African Americans and so frequently provided the material context in which they could more easily participate in civil rights struggles. Rather than seeing the era of New Deal reform as a great exception, and as yet another episode where American politics is hemmed in by the \"original sin\" of race, we should situate the era more firmly within domestic and international class struggle, the historic effort of the US capitalist class to save the system from its own contradictions amid the Depression, and the countervailing movement of popular and labor forces to impose a more just order. 9 This was exceptional in the sense that it marked a period when capital was forced to take responsibility for the costs of social reproduction of labor, a function it has abandoned with far-reaching and disruptive social consequences under decades of neoliberalization, the dismantling of the welfare-state apparatus, and the privatization of formerly public goods and services.\n\nAs they have migrated from the scholarly studies of Ira Katznelson, Jefferson Cowie, and others to the popular renditions of Ta-Nehisi Coates, and into the realm of left common sense, the \"New Deal was racist\" narrative has often conflated the Depression-era New Deal policies with work of the New Deal Democratic coalition after the Second World War. In the process, such accounts run together and roundly condemn policies that were produced through distinct geopolitical contexts, characterized by a shifting balance of class forces, changing partisan and Congressional leadership, and different strategic logics.\n\nThe first and second New Deal enacted under Franklin Roosevelt reflected the growing power of organized labor, and concessions made by capital for the assurance of continued social stability and uninterrupted compound growth. The Fair Deal enacted after the war under the leadership of Harry Truman set in a motion a commercial Keynesian transformation of urban society through the 1949 Housing Act. The expansion of federally backed mortgage lending, massive investments in urban renewal and inner-city public housing construction shifted away from the state-funded and state-managed public works of the Depression creating a bonanza for real estate capital, local construction trades, architectural firms, and manufacturers of industrial building materials. If there is a policy initiative of the New Deal coalition that should be roundly condemned it is this 1949 measure that entrenched racial and class inequalities into a new metropolitan spatial order. The sixties saw efforts of New Deal Democrats to rectify these inequalities, again an important historical detail that is obliterated in the sweeping brush strokes of the \"constraint of race\" narrative. The result was a wave of national antiracist and anti-poverty legislation that produced major social progress, but inasmuch as Great Society legislation avoided direct, aggressive market interventions, such measures failed to create the same structures of employment for the black urban poor that had been produced over time for many whites through public works, defense contracting and industrialization, and the right to collective bargaining.\n\nBoth White and Moody attempt to cast doubt on the prospects of universal public policy in our times. They both abide the \"constraint of race\" thesis, that is that any and all attempts to create social policy that might benefit the greatest number of Americans will ultimately fail because of racism, or in a slightly different iteration, universal public policies will only retrench existing racial disparities of wealth, income, health care, housing, and education.\n\nMoody concludes that my politics are afflicted by nostalgia for the realignment theory touted by Rustin and Michael Harrington. Mind you, he extrapolates this claim from a passing reference to Rustin in my 2017 Catalyst essay, where I briefly criticize Rustin's turn to \"politics of insider negotiation\" before touting the merits of the 1966 Freedom Budget for All Americans he co-authored with Randolph, and lamenting its being eclipsed by Cold War liberals' rather narrow focus on institutional racism and the alleged cultural pathologies of the poor. Somehow, Moody interprets my embrace of that agenda with a wholesale acceptance of Rustin's increasingly conservative commitments to the Democratic Party. In the process, he misreads both Rustin's politics and mine.\n\nI have criticized Rustin's conservative turn in various places, characterizing him as a tragic figure in my 2007 book, Revolutionaries to Race Leaders , and that argument largely channeled Stephen Steinberg's analysis which appeared in New Politics a decade earlier. Moody doesn't attempt to contextualize and explain Rustin's increasing conservatism, so I will here. It is no secret now that Rustin was a marginalized figure during the early stages of the postwar Civil Rights Movement, he was forced to play an offstage role, serving as a mentor to Martin Luther King Jr and a key strategist in various demonstrations that would prove pivotal to the growing movement to topple Jim Crow. He was held at bay by clergy because of his gay sexuality and youthful communist commitments, which made him an easy target for segregationists, the FBI, and other foes of racial progress looking to derail the southern campaigns. After having been closeted within the leadership circles of the postwar movement for years, Rustin finally found himself taking on a more public role as broker between the movement and the Kennedy White House. He justifies his choice of insider-negotiation over popular protests in his 1965 Commentary essay, but in the process Rustin wrongly confines popular struggles to an expired stage in black political development.\n\nRustin's problem was twofold. He simply misread his times, and perhaps more fatally, he jettisoned mass mobilization and civil disobedience, which had been fundamental to the postwar Civil Rights Movement, in favor of brokerage politics with the Democratic Party. He thought the passage of major civil rights legislation was the beginning of a new political stage, one that would make it possible to push for deeper, broader social reforms exclusively through the formal democratic process. As I said in 2015, in an extended interview with UIC graduate student Gregor Baszak, \"I doubt Rustin's wisdom at that historical moment. His belief that participation sans protest could steer the Democratic Party during the middle '60s towards more extensive commitments to social democracy seems even more foolhardy in hindsight. He had reason to be optimistic about the prospects given the Johnson administration's civil rights reforms and the War on Poverty, but there were very real reactionary tendencies within the Democratic Party at that time. The party included Vietnam hawks, Southern segregationists, and legions of voters who were firmly committed to the middle-class consumer society. Rustin cedes too much ground to them. And, again, his fatal flaw is that he no longer seems to appreciate the role of movement pressure.\" Hence, Rustin surrendered the repertoire of movement strategies that might have enabled African Americans and other more progressive elements in American society to press for more substantial policy reforms, such as those contained in the 1966 Freedom Budget .\n\nDespite his strategic missteps and rightward drift, Rustin's criticisms of black separatism and black power militancy remain relevant in this tide of Black Lives Matter. His claim, cited by Moody, that the \"future of the Negro struggle depends on whether the contradictions of this society can be resolved by a coalition of progressive forces which becomes the effective political majority in the United States\" remains powerful, and unfulfilled. Rustin was clear, and we should be as well, that every major political advance of blacks in US history was not merely the outcome of \"self-organization\" of the oppressed, but rather the result of a diverse cast of political actors. The abolition of slavery, the short-lived advances of Federal Reconstruction, the discrete gains of blacks during the Roosevelt administration, and the toppling of the Jim Crow system were achieved through the self-activity of some blacks, the principled commitment of non-blacks to historically concrete forms of social justice, and the begrudging acceptance of still others that the status quo, whether slavery or Jim Crow, was no longer sustainable.\n\nIn slightly different ways, White and Moody both characterize me as some sort of Democratic loyalist who sees the future of blacks or the laboring classes more generally in closing ranks with the Democratic Party. In an odd conclusion, Moody claims that the Sanders wave and surging interest in class analysis and socialism, especially among millennials, may in fact lead to a mass migration of the Left into the Democratic Party ranks. \"With this renewed hope,\" Moody writes, \"has come a demotion of race as a subject of socio-economic analysis in the name of class that is, in reality, a return to America's quintessential business-funded, neoliberal-dominated, undemocratic, cross-class social construction: the Democratic Party.\" White reaches a similar conclusion, \"whereas the pivot to support class political interests along party lines with the kind of power and influence Johnson seeks has not demonstrated to Black Americans the kind of mutuality and support required in an ongoing, historically and cumulatively race-class reality.\" They both fear that emphasizing a class-conscious politics, and organizing around commonly felt needs, that is, those basic necessities that we all require for reproduction, such as food, clothing, housing that is safe and appropriate to our specific needs and life stage, health care, education, time, and space for creative expression and recreation, will consolidate power among the Democrats, and likely produce policies that retrench racial inequalities. I could not disagree more with their conclusions in this regard.\n\nWhat should be clear to anyone paying attention is that the New Democrats are much more willing to embrace versions of liberal antiracism than they are willing to make substantial commitments to broadly redistributive public policy. The Bill Clinton administration pioneered this combination of socially liberal public relations and pro-capitalist national economic and social policy, which included workfare reform and the demolition of public housing via HOPE VI legislation. The Obama administration perfected this combination of socially liberal public relations and neoliberal governance, drawing on his claims to racial authenticity to deflect public criticism and popular outrage over black employment and police killings. The current field of Democratic presidential hopefuls features more of the same, with some like Corey Booker, Elizabeth Warren, and Kamala Harris already floating their version of black reparations, in concert with a growing list of neoliberal reparations devotees including Forbes magazine contributors and New York Times columnist David Brooks . Far from opposing a politics of recognition and racial justice, Democratic centrists are in full embrace of underrepresented minorities, as evidenced in triumphant public and partisan interpretations of the 2018 midterm elections. Equally, they are committed to addressing wealth inequality so long as the proposed policies do not disrupt the sanctity of private property. Put another way, the New Democrats are prepared to do what they have done for the last few decades, continue their low-frequency war against the working class, while embracing racial and gender justice for those who are the most integrated and ideologically committed to neoliberalism.\n\nThe only way I think we can reverse this process, and contest the power of capital, which is enshrined in both parties, is to build working class-centered popular struggles and fight to achieve universal, concrete forms of social justice that improve the lives of the greatest number of Americans. Unlike these authors I believe that politics and context matters, that addressing the expressed needs and desires of working-class Americans need not forever be haunted by the alleged and real failings of the New Deal, Fair Deal, or Great Society regimes of national policy-making.\n\nThis is an ahistorical point that I wish so many on the Left would stop making. It is wrong in terms of historical analysis and politically defeatist as an operating logic. We know that universal policies like Social Security and the national public works programs of the Depression era made life better for millions of Americans. We also know that national anti-discrimination regulation improved the lives of African Americans, expanding the middle class, reducing poverty, and integrating blacks more fully into American life. The lives of millions more could be improved through a combination of universal policies that decommodify housing, education, health care, and transportation, effective anti-discrimination laws that prohibit racist behavior in housing, job markets, and higher education admissions, and federal, state, and local policies that address inequalities in K-12 school district funding, and that strengthen the right to collective bargaining and raise wage floors.\n\nAs I and others have argued before, broad swaths of the black population have long supported universal, progressive social policies, often with greater intensity than other segments of the US population. Although we recall the sixties as a heyday of black \"self-organization\" and the reactionary unionism of George Meany, African Americans were the most likely to join a union during that period. We need a left analysis of American history and contemporary life that proceeds from a clear-headed sense of actually-existing black life. We should not shy away from pursuing these policies because of perceived historical failures, or worse, because of some paranoia of cooptation by the Democratic Party. Both of those concerns seem academic in the worst way to me, divorced from the daily realities and tough choices that many Americans are forced to make at the ballot box and on pay day. The nominal left is already an adjunct to the Democratic Party, largely because of prevalent antipathy among remnants of Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter towards constituted power, and the real difficulty of building popular power in the pro-capitalist and anti-public environment that neoliberalization has produced. In places where the infrastructure and organizing networks exists, socialists should run for public office and build an independent political base, but this is not possible in some parts of the country.\n\nWe need a left politics that organizes for power, and draws a keen distinction between supporting Democratic candidates in specific locales where they are a better option, and building a left politics that cannot be subsumed under the Democratic Party and is ultimately capable of emancipating labor and empowering the masses of Americans. Rustin's basic majoritarian claim that the Left can only win - and implicitly African Americans can only win - by building powerful alliances capable of imposing popular will and contesting the demands capital makes on the planet and our lives, remains very much in front of us.\n\nCedric Johnson is associate professor of African American studies and political science at the University of Illinois at Chicago and editor of The Neoliberal Deluge: Hurricane Katrina, Late Capitalism and the Remaking of New Orleans (University of Minnesota Press, 2011).\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThis has been a nightmarish year. COVID-19 has afflicted about forty-five million people and killed more than a million across the globe. A month after President Donald Trump finally acknowledged that we were in the throes of a pandemic, some eighteen million American workers lost their jobs. While that number has since fallen to thirteen million, economic uncertainty is the new normal.\n\nAlthough a Joe Biden victory would mean that working people will surely lose less ground than under a second Trump term, they are unlikely to make any substantive gains, either - hobbled by the commitment of the Democrats to neoliberalism, not to mention Trump's three US Supreme Court and more than two hundred federal court appointments.\n\nThere are many dissatisfying things about where we are today. But even as I can accept the view that the best we can hope for in the coming weeks is Biden-Harris's promised reprieve from Trumpism's animus-fueled chaos, I remain dismayed by the ubiquitous calls for a \"reckoning\" or a \"collective healing\" that have completely dominated discourse on racial inequality in the months since George Floyd's murder. While I'm sure decent people derive comfort from such phrases, this brand of moralism masks a class politics that offers poor and working-class black and brown people symbolic rather than material rewards.\n\nOur predicament today is obviously far worse than four years ago. But the bleakness of the moment derives not simply from the human tragedies and uncertainties around us. In fact, despite Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton, 2016 offered progressives cause for hope about the future, thanks to the surprising resonance of the Bernie Sanders campaign with voters across partisan lines.\n\nForty-three percent of Democratic primary voters in 2016 responded to Sanders's calls for free higher education, national health care, regulation of Wall Street, and policies intended to encourage the downward redistribution of wealth. This showed that a quarter-century of bipartisan neoliberal policies - which have widened the divide between the rich and everyone else - had not eliminated the potential for a mass egalitarian politics in the United States.\n\nAlthough Sanders's 2020 primary performance was less impressive, the Sanders campaign's imprint on the Democratic electorate - shaped, in no small part, by the unambiguous precarity of Generation Z and millennials - was transparent. At the start of the 2020 Democratic primaries, poll after poll showed a clear majority of Democratic voters, especially those under sixty-five, supported Medicare for All, tuition-free public higher education, and increasing the US minimum wage to a living wage - Sanders's signature platform issues.\n\nAs a result, nearly all of the 2020 Democratic hopefuls declared their support for raising the minimum wage, improving collective bargaining rights, and making college more affordable. And while unabashed centrist Democratic hopefuls like Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, and Joe Biden remained ardently opposed to Medicare for All, the popularity of this issue with voters across partisan lines compelled even figures like Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren to embrace national health insurance - at least for a time.\n\nIf, prior to summer 2020, the impact of Bernie Sanders on Democratic discourse was cause for optimism, the efficacy with which centrist Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden used identity politics to dispatch Sanders was cause for alarm. Attacking Sanders from the right via rhetorically left, identity politics frameworks, centrist Democrats, and even some progressives, identified his platform as an anachronistic class agenda that deflected attention from white racism and its consequences for blacks.\n\nIn 2016, for example, Hillary Clinton asserted that Sanders's calls for stronger banking regulations would not address the \"systemic racism\" that hobbled so many black homeowners - a narrative that shifted attention from Bill Clinton's complicity in the subprime mortgage crisis through deregulation of the banking industry. Falling back on a human-resources-friendly update of \"the Devil made me do it\" defense, Secretary Clinton likewise asserted that the \"implicit bias\" we all share explained her firm embrace of tough-on-crime politics and racist constructs like \"super-predators\" during the 1990s.\n\nIn 2020, Vice President Joe Biden - harmonizing with a narrative advanced by Representative James Clyburn and the Congressional Black Caucus - questioned the commitment of Bernie Sanders to the \"black community\" by, among other things, characterizing Medicare for All as an attempt to erase the legacy of the nation's first black president.\n\nSince the conclusion of the Democratic primaries, discourse on racial inequality has circled the drain of a maudlin anti-racist discourse centered on racial reckonings for the nation's original sin of slavery. If Robin DiAngelo and Ibram Kendi are the most visible apostles in the moral crusade against racism, public intellectual Ta-Nehisi Coates is the movement's prophet in chief. Blending rhetorical militancy with moralistic purple pleading, Coates's 2014 \"The Case for Reparations\" soft-pedaled the demand for reparations to an audience disillusioned with President Obama's post-racial presidency and frustrated by lingering disparities in wealth and the criminal justice system.\n\nCoates's popularity notwithstanding, prior to 2016, the call for reparations was still confined to particular academic circles and the talk show circuit. Two developments created space for reparations to seep into policy discourse.\n\nFirst, the popularity of the Sanders platform revealed mass disaffection with the complicity of the Democrats in the Reagan Revolution. Secondly, Donald Trump's surprise victory over Hillary Clinton, likewise, revealed widening cleavages within the Democratic Party, since the win was made possible by a combination of depressed Democratic turnout and Trump flipping a sufficient number of Obama voters in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin.\n\nIn the wake of Clinton's defeat, Coates's \"The Case for Reparations,\" along with its many sequels, provided the Democratic Party of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama with convenient cover for the damage it inflicted on working-class Americans - white and black alike. Specifically, Coates's insistence that the voters Trump had flipped were motivated, in no small part, by a desire to erase the legacy of the nation's first (neoliberal) black president, complemented the DNC's self-serving election postmortem.\n\nIndeed, Coates and the DNC either ignored or downplayed the disaffection engendered among unionized blue-collar voters by Obama's decision to rescind his support for the Employee Free Choice Act; Obama's active support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership; and his means-tested, Heritage Foundation-inspired Affordable Care Act with its tax on nonprofit union health plans, which - had this provision been implemented - would have been bankrupted to subsidize private, for-profit health insurance. By attributing Trump's victory to the \"bloody heirloom\" of white supremacy, then, the accounts offered by Coates and the DNC obscured the electoral consequences of the neoliberal policies pursued by Obama and the Clintons - policies that did real damage to an important segment of Democratic voters.\n\nAlthough Coates ultimately voted for Sanders in 2016, his attacks on the calls made by Sanders for universal and redistributive programs aided and abetted a rightward attack on the kind of class-based policies from which the masses of working-class and poor blacks and Hispanics would disproportionately benefit. Since African Americans are, indeed, overrepresented among the nation's poor and working class, blacks would have benefited disproportionately from Medicare for All, living wage polices, tuition-free public higher education, and a more robust public sector.\n\nTo be clear, I doubt neither Coates's sincerity nor his good intentions. However, his reparations advocacy rests upon a basic mischaracterization of the inadequacies of American liberalism, and that his project - steeped as it is in moralism - is an unwitting call to continue along much the same path that has failed poor and working-class blacks since the 1960s.\n\nThere is no doubt that postwar liberal orthodoxies failed to redress racial disparities. The culprit, however, is not the sway of a metaphysical racism, as Coates argues. Rather, the roots of contemporary disparities can be traced to far more comprehensible forces, including: the tensions within the New Deal between the regulatory and compensatory state models and the related mid-century tensions between industrial and commercial Keynesians; the contrasting influences of the New Deal and the Cold War on the parameters of liberal discourse about race and inequality; and neoliberalism's rise from the ashes of the Keynesian consensus.\n\nIn other words, the failure of postwar and contemporary liberalism is not, as Coates insists, because liberals have long attempted to redress black poverty by reducing racism to class exploitation, resulting in universal policies that focus on economic sources of inequality as an alternative to addressing racism. The problem is that liberals have divorced racial inequality from political economy.\n\nIn fact, liberals have consistently rejected redistributive class-based anti-poverty policies that might address the sources of economic inequality that have, indeed, impacted blacks disproportionately.\n\nInformed by culturalist constructs like ethnic pluralism, the culture of poverty, and underclass ideology, liberal policymakers since the 1960s have generally downplayed or even ignored the disproportionate impact on African Americans of issues such as deindustrialization, the decline of the union movement, and the retreat of the public sector. In the 1960s and '70s, the consequences of this disposition were not so terrible, since the postwar consensus remained in place, causing liberals to pursue anti-poverty policies centered on the expansion of social services and even state-centered regulation of labor relations via affirmative action.\n\nHowever, the breakdown of that consensus and the rise of neoliberalism ensured that Democratic presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama would follow the lead of their Republican counterparts, chipping away at the rights and protections that disproportionately benefitted black Americans, at the very same time as they championed (or personified) diversity.\n\nTo say that postwar and contemporary liberalism have not served most black Americans well is not to deny the historic importance of - or the current need for - antidiscrimination policies. Antidiscrimination legislation such as the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1968 and policies like affirmative action helped improve the lives of many black Americans - my parents and myself among them, just as my grandparents benefited from the GI Bill and New Deal programs.\n\nNevertheless, policies like these have failed to eliminate disparities because earning power for all but the top wage earners has been on a fifty-year decline. As I pointed out in a previous essay, between 1968 and 2016, median black household income increased from the twenty-fifth percentile to the thirty-fifth percentile. Over the same period, median white household income moved from the fifty-fourth to the fifty-seventh percentile. However, despite the relative gains that blacks have made with the aid of antidiscrimination policies, the wage and wealth gap has scarcely budged since 1968. Automation, the slow death of the union movement, and public-sector retrenchment have contributed to a decline in real income for the bottom 80 percent of American workers.\n\nThe good news is that the relative gains blacks have made since 1968 have prevented the racial income gap from worsening. In fact, had African Americans not made any relative progress over the past fifty years, the ratio of median black to white household income would have fallen from 57 percent to 44 percent. The bad news is that the black-white family income ratio would have risen from 57 percent to 70 percent if overall wages had remained constant over the past fifty years.\n\nThe call for \"universal\" programs such as Medicare for All and redistributive class-based reforms - like the Fight for $15, a more robust public sector, a stronger union movement, free public higher education, etc. - is not a denial of the existence of racism. Nor is it an argument for eliminating antidiscrimination policies. But if we don't view racial disparities through the lens of American political economy, we will not only fail to redress income inequality - we will also fail to eliminate black poverty.\n\nThis concern is, of course, at the heart of the problem with Coates's analysis, which mischaracterizes the root causes of the failures of liberalism. Worse yet, the author's moralizing and frequent use of metaphor as an alternative to analysis makes it possible to sidestep solutions. Consider the following passage from \"The Case for Reparations\" on the utility of HR 40:\n\nPerhaps after a serious discussion and debate - the kind that HR 40 proposes - we may find that the country can never fully repay African Americans. But we stand to discover much about ourselves in such a discussion - and that is perhaps what scares us.\n\nInsinuating that the exercise alone has the potential to check racism's eternal sway, he continues:\n\nThe recovering alcoholic may well have to live with his illness the rest of his life. But at least he is not living a drunken lie. . . . What is needed is an airing of family secrets, a settling with old ghosts. What is needed is a healing of the American psyche and the banishment of white guilt.\n\nThe moralistic pitch of \"The Case for Reparations,\" combined with Coates's fuzziness on the difference between anything reasonably understood as reparations on the one hand and torts or charity on the other, led me to the following conclusion in March 2018:\n\nWhereas President Obama's soaring post-racialism licensed the continuation of liberal indifference to the plight of economically marginal people via underclass metaphors, Coates's post-post-racial commitment to racial ontology signs off on white liberal hand-wringing and public displays of guilt as alternatives to practicable solutions to disparities. To be sure, this is not Coates's formal intent, even if the words on the page imply that Coates might find a racial Festivus to be an acceptable alternative to material compensation. But because reparations is a political dead end, Coates is offering white liberals - and even a stratum of conservatives - who are either self-consciously or reflexively committed to neoliberal orthodoxies absolution via public testimony to their privilege and their so-called racial sins.\n\nThe volte-face of conservative columnist David Brooks on reparations is a good example of the issue that I pointed to. Over the past couple of years, Brooks has moved from being a Coates fan who dismissed reparations but appreciated Coates's explorations of \"black rage,\" to a self-identified supporter of reparations - at least as a brand.\n\nIn his March 2019 New York Times op-ed, \"The Case for Reparations,\" Brooks spoke of the necessity of reparations to mend a \"racial divide born out of [the] sin\" of slavery. According to Brooks, bondage did not inflict injury solely upon the slaves themselves: slavery's corrupting influence over our \"whole society\" can still be felt today.\n\nBrooks insisted that the time for a \"racial reckoning\" and the payment of a \"collective debt\" is now. Nevertheless, he still rejected the idea of reparations in the form of a direct cash payments - and did so by quoting the following passage from Coates:\n\nAnd so we must imagine a new country. Reparations - by which I mean the full acceptance of our collective biography and its consequences - is the price we must pay to see ourselves squarely . . . What I'm talking about is more than recompense for past injustice - more than a handout, a payoff, hush money, or a reluctant bribe. What I'm talking about is a national reckoning that would lead to spiritual renewal.\n\nA year later, Brooks elaborated on his vision of reparations in another New York Times op-ed , \"How to Do Reparations Right.\" For Brooks, reparations \"would involve an official apology for centuries of slavery and discrimination and spending to reduce their effects.\" The practicable solutions Brooks advocates center on grants to community leaders - people who have the clearest window onto their communities' needs.\n\nThe conservative columnist acknowledges that his proposal sounds quite like the failed Community Action Programs (CAP) of the War on Poverty, but asserts that CAP failed because it funded disruptive agitators who stirred up conflict between local activists and elected officials. Brooks, by contrast, envisions funding channeled to responsible community leaders only - whatever that means.\n\nOf course, CAP was ultimately doomed to failure because the Johnson administration paid little heed to the disproportionate effects of deindustrialization on blacks and other low-skilled workers. Its anti-poverty agenda eschewed direct job creation in favor of antidiscrimination legislation, cultural tutelage for the black underclass, and tax cuts intended to stimulate economic growth - all of which Brooks has endorsed as well.\n\nSince the 2016 Democratic primaries and the breakthrough of the Sanders campaign, topics that had long been dismissed as pie in the sky have become part of regular discourse. The brutal murders of men and women who are disproportionately black or brown, caught on video, have helped galvanize calls for criminal justice reform.\n\nBut if we view the problems of poverty, health care, and criminal justice through a lens that filters out the political-economic underpinnings of these injustices - informed by the language of moral reckoning - we may just end up with modest reforms at best and symbolic gestures at worst, when what we need is fundamental structural change.\n\nIndeed, the weeks immediately following the police murder of George Floyd by Derek Chauvin opened the floodgates for public displays of racial guilt and penance. Aunt Jemima announced it was changing its brand name, finally acknowledging - as the chief marketing officer of Quaker Foods, Kristin Kroepfl, put it - that it was \"based on a racial stereotype.\"\n\nHundreds of whites in George Floyd's hometown kneeled to ask \"the black community\" for their forgiveness, as efforts to remove the many monuments to treasonous defenders of slavery that mar the Southern landscape gathered pace. Chick-fil-A's conservative Christian CEO, Dan Cathy, called on his fellow parishioners at Atlanta's Passion City Church to repent and fight for black Americans. And about a dozen corporations - with several former American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) members among them - set aside nearly $2 billion for anti-racist initiatives.\n\nTo be sure, the moment of \"racial reckoning\" that lies before us has produced rhetorical interest in reparations among policymakers. Still, Democratic politicians who have insisted on both the righteousness and rightness of reparations - ranging from progressive Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren to Newark mayor Ras Baraka - have merely rebranded means-tested and trickle-down policies as \"reparations.\" In much the same way as David Brooks, Warren, Baraka, and Joe Biden have advocated solutions that sound like a cross between the Johnson administration's War on Poverty and Nixon's black capitalism.\n\nHuman tragedy abounds in this moment, from police violence to COVID-19, and it is good that people are alive to some of the many problems that plague us now. But we need to reason our way out of the misery before us, rather than simply \" feel \" our way through this quagmire. We need to think about the kinds of coalitions our conceptual frameworks will help us forge, and whether those frameworks and coalitions will bring us to our desired ends.\n\nThe fact that former ALEC affiliates can \"embrace\" constructs like \"moral reckonings\" and \"systemic racism\" tells us something vital about where this road will take us. ALEC has drafted model legislation calling for the privatization of public schools and universities, as well as bills that have sought to erode environmental regulations, worker safety, and the right to collective bargaining. ALEC also drafted the model legislation that gave us Florida's \"Stand Your Ground\" laws - which contributed to the murder of Trayvon Martin and ultimately led to the acquittal of George Zimmerman - along with similar legislation in many other states.\n\nWhat kind of democracy do we want to live in? Do we want to live in a democracy where 13 percent of each class layer - rich, middle class, poor - are black, while 90 percent of the population struggles to make ends meet? Or do we want to live in the kind of democracy where no one has to suffer the nagging misery of despair and vulnerability because of stark material inequities?\n\nTouré F.

And while unabashed centrist Democratic hopefuls like Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, and Joe Biden remained ardently opposed to Medicare for All, the popularity of this issue with voters across partisan lines compelled even figures like Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren to embrace national health insurance - at least for a time.\n\nIf, prior to summer 2020, the impact of Bernie Sanders on Democratic discourse was cause for optimism, the efficacy with which centrist Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden used identity politics to dispatch Sanders was cause for alarm. Attacking Sanders from the right via rhetorically left, identity politics frameworks, centrist Democrats, and even some progressives, identified his platform as an anachronistic class agenda that deflected attention from white racism and its consequences for blacks.\n\nIn 2016, for example, Hillary Clinton asserted that Sanders's calls for stronger banking regulations would not address the \"systemic racism\" that hobbled so many black homeowners - a narrative that shifted attention from Bill Clinton's complicity in the subprime mortgage crisis through deregulation of the banking industry. Falling back on a human-resources-friendly update of \"the Devil made me do it\" defense, Secretary Clinton likewise asserted that the \"implicit bias\" we all share explained her firm embrace of tough-on-crime politics and racist constructs like \"super-predators\" during the 1990s.\n\nIn 2020, Vice President Joe Biden - harmonizing with a narrative advanced by Representative James Clyburn and the Congressional Black Caucus - questioned the commitment of Bernie Sanders to the \"black community\" by, among other things, characterizing Medicare for All as an attempt to erase the legacy of the nation's first black president.\n\nSince the conclusion of the Democratic primaries, discourse on racial inequality has circled the drain of a maudlin anti-racist discourse centered on racial reckonings for the nation's original sin of slavery. If Robin DiAngelo and Ibram Kendi are the most visible apostles in the moral crusade against racism, public intellectual Ta-Nehisi Coates is the movement's prophet in chief. Blending rhetorical militancy with moralistic purple pleading, Coates's 2014 \"The Case for Reparations\" soft-pedaled the demand for reparations to an audience disillusioned with President Obama's post-racial presidency and frustrated by lingering disparities in wealth and the criminal justice system.\n\nCoates's popularity notwithstanding, prior to 2016, the call for reparations was still confined to particular academic circles and the talk show circuit. Two developments created space for reparations to seep into policy discourse.\n\nFirst, the popularity of the Sanders platform revealed mass disaffection with the complicity of the Democrats in the Reagan Revolution. Secondly, Donald Trump's surprise victory over Hillary Clinton, likewise, revealed widening cleavages within the Democratic Party, since the win was made possible by a combination of depressed Democratic turnout and Trump flipping a sufficient number of Obama voters in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin.\n\nIn the wake of Clinton's defeat, Coates's \"The Case for Reparations,\" along with its many sequels, provided the Democratic Party of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama with convenient cover for the damage it inflicted on working-class Americans - white and black alike. Specifically, Coates's insistence that the voters Trump had flipped were motivated, in no small part, by a desire to erase the legacy of the nation's first (neoliberal) black president, complemented the DNC's self-serving election postmortem.\n\nIndeed, Coates and the DNC either ignored or downplayed the disaffection engendered among unionized blue-collar voters by Obama's decision to rescind his support for the Employee Free Choice Act; Obama's active support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership; and his means-tested, Heritage Foundation-inspired Affordable Care Act with its tax on nonprofit union health plans, which - had this provision been implemented - would have been bankrupted to subsidize private, for-profit health insurance. By attributing Trump's victory to the \"bloody heirloom\" of white supremacy, then, the accounts offered by Coates and the DNC obscured the electoral consequences of the neoliberal policies pursued by Obama and the Clintons - policies that did real damage to an important segment of Democratic voters.\n\nAlthough Coates ultimately voted for Sanders in 2016, his attacks on the calls made by Sanders for universal and redistributive programs aided and abetted a rightward attack on the kind of class-based policies from which the masses of working-class and poor blacks and Hispanics would disproportionately benefit. Since African Americans are, indeed, overrepresented among the nation's poor and working class, blacks would have benefited disproportionately from Medicare for All, living wage polices, tuition-free public higher education, and a more robust public sector.\n\nTo be clear, I doubt neither Coates's sincerity nor his good intentions. However, his reparations advocacy rests upon a basic mischaracterization of the inadequacies of American liberalism, and that his project - steeped as it is in moralism - is an unwitting call to continue along much the same path that has failed poor and working-class blacks since the 1960s.\n\nThere is no doubt that postwar liberal orthodoxies failed to redress racial disparities. The culprit, however, is not the sway of a metaphysical racism, as Coates argues. Rather, the roots of contemporary disparities can be traced to far more comprehensible forces, including: the tensions within the New Deal between the regulatory and compensatory state models and the related mid-century tensions between industrial and commercial Keynesians; the contrasting influences of the New Deal and the Cold War on the parameters of liberal discourse about race and inequality; and neoliberalism's rise from the ashes of the Keynesian consensus.\n\nIn other words, the failure of postwar and contemporary liberalism is not, as Coates insists, because liberals have long attempted to redress black poverty by reducing racism to class exploitation, resulting in universal policies that focus on economic sources of inequality as an alternative to addressing racism. The problem is that liberals have divorced racial inequality from political economy.\n\nIn fact, liberals have consistently rejected redistributive class-based anti-poverty policies that might address the sources of economic inequality that have, indeed, impacted blacks disproportionately.\n\nInformed by culturalist constructs like ethnic pluralism, the culture of poverty, and underclass ideology, liberal policymakers since the 1960s have generally downplayed or even ignored the disproportionate impact on African Americans of issues such as deindustrialization, the decline of the union movement, and the retreat of the public sector. In the 1960s and '70s, the consequences of this disposition were not so terrible, since the postwar consensus remained in place, causing liberals to pursue anti-poverty policies centered on the expansion of social services and even state-centered regulation of labor relations via affirmative action.\n\nHowever, the breakdown of that consensus and the rise of neoliberalism ensured that Democratic presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama would follow the lead of their Republican counterparts, chipping away at the rights and protections that disproportionately benefitted black Americans, at the very same time as they championed (or personified) diversity.\n\nTo say that postwar and contemporary liberalism have not served most black Americans well is not to deny the historic importance of - or the current need for - antidiscrimination policies. Antidiscrimination legislation such as the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1968 and policies like affirmative action helped improve the lives of many black Americans - my parents and myself among them, just as my grandparents benefited from the GI Bill and New Deal programs.\n\nNevertheless, policies like these have failed to eliminate disparities because earning power for all but the top wage earners has been on a fifty-year decline. As I pointed out in a previous essay, between 1968 and 2016, median black household income increased from the twenty-fifth percentile to the thirty-fifth percentile. Over the same period, median white household income moved from the fifty-fourth to the fifty-seventh percentile. However, despite the relative gains that blacks have made with the aid of antidiscrimination policies, the wage and wealth gap has scarcely budged since 1968. Automation, the slow death of the union movement, and public-sector retrenchment have contributed to a decline in real income for the bottom 80 percent of American workers.\n\nThe good news is that the relative gains blacks have made since 1968 have prevented the racial income gap from worsening. In fact, had African Americans not made any relative progress over the past fifty years, the ratio of median black to white household income would have fallen from 57 percent to 44 percent. The bad news is that the black-white family income ratio would have risen from 57 percent to 70 percent if overall wages had remained constant over the past fifty years.\n\nThe call for \"universal\" programs such as Medicare for All and redistributive class-based reforms - like the Fight for $15, a more robust public sector, a stronger union movement, free public higher education, etc. - is not a denial of the existence of racism. Nor is it an argument for eliminating antidiscrimination policies. But if we don't view racial disparities through the lens of American political economy, we will not only fail to redress income inequality - we will also fail to eliminate black poverty.\n\nThis concern is, of course, at the heart of the problem with Coates's analysis, which mischaracterizes the root causes of the failures of liberalism. Worse yet, the author's moralizing and frequent use of metaphor as an alternative to analysis makes it possible to sidestep solutions. Consider the following passage from \"The Case for Reparations\" on the utility of HR 40:\n\nPerhaps after a serious discussion and debate - the kind that HR 40 proposes - we may find that the country can never fully repay African Americans. But we stand to discover much about ourselves in such a discussion - and that is perhaps what scares us.\n\nInsinuating that the exercise alone has the potential to check racism's eternal sway, he continues:\n\nThe recovering alcoholic may well have to live with his illness the rest of his life. But at least he is not living a drunken lie. . . . What is needed is an airing of family secrets, a settling with old ghosts. What is needed is a healing of the American psyche and the banishment of white guilt.\n\nThe moralistic pitch of \"The Case for Reparations,\" combined with Coates's fuzziness on the difference between anything reasonably understood as reparations on the one hand and torts or charity on the other, led me to the following conclusion in March 2018:\n\nWhereas President Obama's soaring post-racialism licensed the continuation of liberal indifference to the plight of economically marginal people via underclass metaphors, Coates's post-post-racial commitment to racial ontology signs off on white liberal hand-wringing and public displays of guilt as alternatives to practicable solutions to disparities. To be sure, this is not Coates's formal intent, even if the words on the page imply that Coates might find a racial Festivus to be an acceptable alternative to material compensation. But because reparations is a political dead end, Coates is offering white liberals - and even a stratum of conservatives - who are either self-consciously or reflexively committed to neoliberal orthodoxies absolution via public testimony to their privilege and their so-called racial sins.\n\nThe volte-face of conservative columnist David Brooks on reparations is a good example of the issue that I pointed to. Over the past couple of years, Brooks has moved from being a Coates fan who dismissed reparations but appreciated Coates's explorations of \"black rage,\" to a self-identified supporter of reparations - at least as a brand.\n\nIn his March 2019 New York Times op-ed, \"The Case for Reparations,\" Brooks spoke of the necessity of reparations to mend a \"racial divide born out of [the] sin\" of slavery. According to Brooks, bondage did not inflict injury solely upon the slaves themselves: slavery's corrupting influence over our \"whole society\" can still be felt today.\n\nBrooks insisted that the time for a \"racial reckoning\" and the payment of a \"collective debt\" is now. Nevertheless, he still rejected the idea of reparations in the form of a direct cash payments - and did so by quoting the following passage from Coates:\n\nAnd so we must imagine a new country. Reparations - by which I mean the full acceptance of our collective biography and its consequences - is the price we must pay to see ourselves squarely . . . What I'm talking about is more than recompense for past injustice - more than a handout, a payoff, hush money, or a reluctant bribe. What I'm talking about is a national reckoning that would lead to spiritual renewal.\n\nA year later, Brooks elaborated on his vision of reparations in another New York Times op-ed , \"How to Do Reparations Right.\" For Brooks, reparations \"would involve an official apology for centuries of slavery and discrimination and spending to reduce their effects.\" The practicable solutions Brooks advocates center on grants to community leaders - people who have the clearest window onto their communities' needs.\n\nThe conservative columnist acknowledges that his proposal sounds quite like the failed Community Action Programs (CAP) of the War on Poverty, but asserts that CAP failed because it funded disruptive agitators who stirred up conflict between local activists and elected officials. Brooks, by contrast, envisions funding channeled to responsible community leaders only - whatever that means.\n\nOf course, CAP was ultimately doomed to failure because the Johnson administration paid little heed to the disproportionate effects of deindustrialization on blacks and other low-skilled workers. Its anti-poverty agenda eschewed direct job creation in favor of antidiscrimination legislation, cultural tutelage for the black underclass, and tax cuts intended to stimulate economic growth - all of which Brooks has endorsed as well.\n\nSince the 2016 Democratic primaries and the breakthrough of the Sanders campaign, topics that had long been dismissed as pie in the sky have become part of regular discourse. The brutal murders of men and women who are disproportionately black or brown, caught on video, have helped galvanize calls for criminal justice reform.\n\nBut if we view the problems of poverty, health care, and criminal justice through a lens that filters out the political-economic underpinnings of these injustices - informed by the language of moral reckoning - we may just end up with modest reforms at best and symbolic gestures at worst, when what we need is fundamental structural change.\n\nIndeed, the weeks immediately following the police murder of George Floyd by Derek Chauvin opened the floodgates for public displays of racial guilt and penance. Aunt Jemima announced it was changing its brand name, finally acknowledging - as the chief marketing officer of Quaker Foods, Kristin Kroepfl, put it - that it was \"based on a racial stereotype.\"\n\nHundreds of whites in George Floyd's hometown kneeled to ask \"the black community\" for their forgiveness, as efforts to remove the many monuments to treasonous defenders of slavery that mar the Southern landscape gathered pace. Chick-fil-A's conservative Christian CEO, Dan Cathy, called on his fellow parishioners at Atlanta's Passion City Church to repent and fight for black Americans. And about a dozen corporations - with several former American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) members among them - set aside nearly $2 billion for anti-racist initiatives.\n\nTo be sure, the moment of \"racial reckoning\" that lies before us has produced rhetorical interest in reparations among policymakers. Still, Democratic politicians who have insisted on both the righteousness and rightness of reparations - ranging from progressive Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren to Newark mayor Ras Baraka - have merely rebranded means-tested and trickle-down policies as \"reparations.\" In much the same way as David Brooks, Warren, Baraka, and Joe Biden have advocated solutions that sound like a cross between the Johnson administration's War on Poverty and Nixon's black capitalism.\n\nHuman tragedy abounds in this moment, from police violence to COVID-19, and it is good that people are alive to some of the many problems that plague us now. But we need to reason our way out of the misery before us, rather than simply \" feel \" our way through this quagmire. We need to think about the kinds of coalitions our conceptual frameworks will help us forge, and whether those frameworks and coalitions will bring us to our desired ends.\n\nThe fact that former ALEC affiliates can \"embrace\" constructs like \"moral reckonings\" and \"systemic racism\" tells us something vital about where this road will take us. ALEC has drafted model legislation calling for the privatization of public schools and universities, as well as bills that have sought to erode environmental regulations, worker safety, and the right to collective bargaining. ALEC also drafted the model legislation that gave us Florida's \"Stand Your Ground\" laws - which contributed to the murder of Trayvon Martin and ultimately led to the acquittal of George Zimmerman - along with similar legislation in many other states.\n\nWhat kind of democracy do we want to live in? Do we want to live in a democracy where 13 percent of each class layer - rich, middle class, poor - are black, while 90 percent of the population struggles to make ends meet? Or do we want to live in the kind of democracy where no one has to suffer the nagging misery of despair and vulnerability because of stark material inequities?\n\nTouré F.

In Struggle , his series of paintings on the American Revolution, he opened up new territory in American history by venturing beyond the narrow set of topics like Harlem, jazz clubs, and cotton plantations which had become synonymous with black art in mid-century America.\n\nJacob Lawrence was an American painter who grew up in Harlem.

Today, it is mostly a site of vacuous patriotism, its themes appropriated by the Tea Party and recently echoed in the rhetoric of the Trump supporters who broke into the Capitol chanting \"1776.\"\n\nSince the first stirrings of conflict between Britain and the colonists, American radicals have pointed out the hypocrisy of the revolutionary elite who demanded equality for themselves while holding people in bondage. It is perhaps surprising, then, that Jacob Lawrence, the celebrated painter of the black working class, took up this history in a thirty-painting series entitled Struggle: From the History of the American People .\n\nBorn in Atlantic City and raised in Harlem, Lawrence got his start as a Works Progress Administration-sponsored artist during the New Deal. A creator of intimately scaled history paintings during a period when monumentality and abstraction was dominant in art, his best known work, the sixty-panel Migration Series, addresses the mass movement of African Americans from the rural south into northern cities and the resulting social, cultural, and economic changes to black life.\n\nElsewhere, Lawrence's paintings represent histories of black liberation, chronicling the lives of revolutionaries including Toussaint L'Ouverture , Harriet Tubman, and John Brown in a dynamic, cubism-inflected style. His political commitments, which earned him a spot on an FBI watch list in 1953, are manifest in his bold and straightforward depictions of segregation, police brutality, poverty, and violent evictions in his Harlem community.\n\nCreated between 1954 and 1956, Struggle is among Lawrence's least-known works. Last year, twenty-six of its thirty panels (four are unlocated and possibly lost) were reunited and exhibited for the first time since 1958. Executed in vivid egg tempera, they explore the early history of the United States, from the American Revolution through the end of the War of 1812.\n\nAs the struggle for equal rights accelerated in the South, Lawrence, whose work was more typically inspired by personal experience and family history - his own parents were among the thousands who traveled north seeking employment during the Great Migration - turned his attention to the first few decades of the nation.\n\nWhat possibilities did Lawrence see in this history? He began work on the series in 1954, the same year the United States Supreme Court ruled to desegregate American schools in Brown v. Board of Education , precipitating a violent backlash in southern states. In this context, what is striking about Lawrence's paintings is that they offer an integrated vision of revolutionary struggle.\n\nAn early image in the series centers Crispus Attucks, a dockworker of African and Native descent who is thought to have been the first colonial to die in the revolution. As the wounded Attucks crumples to the ground, clutching his chest, his co-conspirators react in anger and horror.\n\nAnother painting represents a violent battle between red-coated Hessians and the Continental Army. Amid a frenzied snarl of angled limbs and interlocking bayonets, a mounted white officer and black soldier suffer the same fate, both reeling backward from bloody head wounds.\n\nIn this painting and throughout the series, Lawrence makes a point of centering black people in his scenes of early American history. Today, such images might suggest a Hamilton-style recasting of history - a hollow multiculturalism in the service of a hollow patriotism, sounding alarm bells for those of us rightly skeptical of neoliberalism's cooptation of the aesthetics of diversity. Lawrence's concern, however, was with historical fidelity, which he deployed as a corrective to segregated mainstream history.\n\nLawrence prepared to paint Struggle by consulting sources at Harlem's Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. His question, as he posed it in a later interview, was \"how...and to what degree the Negro had participated in American history.\" His research turned up not only information on identifiable figures like Attucks, but on the nine thousand persons of African descent who served in the colonial army, some of whom enlisted as free men, and others of whom were promised freedom for their military service.\n\nPerhaps inspired by W. E. B. Du Bois , whom he cites admiringly in the same interview, Lawrence drew from alternative sources to craft a revisionist history of the nation's formation. Much as Du Bois does in Black Reconstruction 's account of the Civil War's \"general strike,\" in which enslaved men and women depleted the economic power of the Confederacy and secured a Union victory by emancipating themselves from plantation labor, Lawrence restores agency to black people and highlights their largely unrecognized contributions to the revolutionary cause.\n\nThe persistent framing of African-American history as lying outside of United States history did and still casts black people as \"exceptions,\" exempt from historic promises of liberty and equality. By desegregating the mainstream American narrative of the period, Lawrence repudiated both radical and reactionary separatist efforts to divorce black Americans from the nation's past and difference them in its present.\n\nStruggle 's omissions are as revealing as its inclusions. Unlike mainstream accounts of the American Revolution, which present the war and its outcome as largely the result of the goings and doings of wealthy white gentlemen in tri-corner hats, the founding fathers are almost entirely absent from Lawrence's series.\n\nEven if the exact date doesn't ring a bell, the events of December 27, 1776 have been seared into the American unconscious thanks in large part to Emanuel Leutze's painting Washington Crossing the Delaware . Against a dramatic sunrise sky, Leutze's Washington, flanked by a billowing flag, assumes an epic posture, gazing steadfastly forward with one foot on the prow of the boat.\n\nIn contrast, Lawrence gives us huddled forms in blood-spattered boats, whose hunched postures resemble the cold and choppy waves through which they struggle to row.\n\nIn Struggle , as the series' title suggests, the work of revolution and nation-building is undertaken by anonymous figures participating in a collective project. While some framings characterize the American Revolution as a fight between British and colonial elites vying for economic power, Lawrence emphasizes the role of the workingmen, tenant farmers, and salaried laborers who attended radical meetings, formed militias, and enlisted to fight for national self-determination, political democracy, an end to privileges of rank, and material improvements to their lives, like land reform.\n\nInstead of handing the credit to the founding fathers, Lawrence, like socialist revolutionaries from Eugene Debs to Lenin , claimed America, and the principles of democracy and freedom, as the product of collective struggle.\n\nAlthough Lawrence portrays the contribution of black people to the American side of the conflict , his series makes no reference to the 20,000 black men who fought for the British , many of whom were also fugitive slaves promised freedom by the crown. By keeping the focus on American history, Lawrence avoids asking whether the cause for which black soldiers were prepared to fight and die was freedom from British tyranny or from slavery.\n\nElsewhere in the series, however, Lawrence brings these tensions to the fore. By creating an assemblage of paintings representing figures from different social groups, economic classes, and racial backgrounds, he asks viewers to grapple with the contradictions that shaped the early history of the United States, among them the irreconcilable oppositions between liberty and (human) property, and between American independence and Native sovereignty.\n\nLawrence juxtaposes the indigenous fight against colonial encroachment with American protests against British imperialism. In his depiction of the Boston Tea Party, Lawrence chooses to emphasize a lesser-known detail about the event: that the protesters were dressed as Indians.\n\nBy representing the colonists in face paint and feathers, he places this scene in dialogue with a later painting representing the Battle of Tippecanoe, where similarly-dressed members of the Native confederation led by Shawnee chief Tecumseh fight with American soldiers in a bid of resistance against westward expansion. By counterposing these competing and incompatible claims to sovereignty, Lawrence highlights the hypocrisy of the colonial demand for self-determination.\n\nMost of Struggle 's paintings are titled with excerpts from primary sources, including letters, popular songs, and military reports. By quoting from these documents, Lawrence gives voice to the contradictions that define this period. It is certainly no accident that the very first painting in the series takes its title from Patrick Henry's 1775 address to the Second Virginia Convention: \"Is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery?\"\n\nLawrence literalizes this rhetorical complaint of enslavement in his portrayals of actual antislavery struggles. One of the series' most harrowing images depicts such an uprising.\n\nDark brown bodies, shackled but nude, meet the clothed forms of lighter-colored figures at the painting's vertical axis in a spasm of violence. This unidentified revolt, which stands in for thousands of forgotten bids for freedom, should be seen as just as critical to the formation of the United States as the crossing of the Delaware, or the Constitutional Convention.\n\nLawrence returns to this theme later in the series in a painting in which four men, two black and two white, are shown locked in violent combat. Deep gouges, which Lawrence created by scraping away at the paint with a sharp tool, mar the back of one of the black men - maybe wounds inflicted during this fight or older remnants of the lash. This painting follows immediately after one entitled \"Peace,\" referring to the Treaty of Ghent and the end of the War of 1812 - a reminder while an international war had ended, an internal fight for freedom continued.\n\nLawrence's title for this painting seems almost a response to Patrick Henry's earlier incitement of revolution. Taken from a letter written in 1810 by Captain James, an enslaved man who was planning a revolt, it reads, \"for freedom we want and will have, for we have served this cruel land long enuff.\"\n\nBy placing the fight for black liberation in dialogue with the themes of the American Revolution, Lawrence asserts the significance of the struggle against monarchic colonial rule and for liberty and equality while still demanding an answer to the question, as Frederick Douglass posed it , \"What, to the slave, is the fourth of July?\" His intervention represents black history not as a particularist \"special interest,\" but as an integral component of an ongoing democratic endeavor.\n\nLawrence originally envisioned Struggle as a larger project. A grant application, which was on view alongside the series at the Metropolitan Museum of Art last year, outlines his plan to represent much more of America's history, beginning with the founding of the Chesapeake Bay colonies and continuing through the end of World War I. The litany of events he saw as critical to this narrative makes it clear that for Lawrence, American history was not a triumphalist tale of victory, but an ongoing struggle to make the nation live up to its purported values.\n\nWe can only imagine how he would have, as he proposed, represented the experience of indentured servants, the growth of the plantation economy, settler-colonialism in the American West, the rise of the Ku Klux Klan, the meat-packing plants of Chicago and the steel mills of Pittsburgh, and the fight to establish labor unions.\n\nAs a single episode in this litany of events, Lawrence's American Revolution recalls Marxist analysis. The conflict was an unfinished attempt at revolution, betrayed by elite efforts to limit popular democracy and protect chattel slavery, which nevertheless represented a significant step toward freedom.\n\nAlthough Lawrence was one of the most successful black artists of his day, he couldn't secure funding to complete the series as he intended. Nor was he able to publish Struggle, as he had hoped, or to find a single buyer for the complete set of paintings. Despite his wish to keep the series united, his paintings were dispersed, and some were lost.\n\nWhy this lack of interest? Were funders, gallerists, and art collectors skeptical of Lawrence's integrated narrative of revolution and nation-building? Were they uncomfortable with his exploration of the contradictions inherent in the American endeavor? Or was American history perhaps considered an inappropriate subject for a black artist?\n\nLawrence, like many of his peers, expressed frustration with the art world's tacit insistence that black artists focus exclusively on \"black\" themes, a ghettoization that limited opportunities and resulted in the de facto segregation of museum and gallery exhibitions. In addressing national and universal concerns, Lawrence ventured beyond the narrow set of topics - Harlem neighborhoods, jazz clubs, cotton plantations - which had become synonymous with blackness in mid-century American culture. By doing so, he opened up new territory in American history and staked a claim for himself and for black Americans.\n\nStruggle: From the History of the American People will be on view at the Seattle Art Museum from March 5 through May 23 and at the Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C. from June 26 to September 1, 2021. The series was previously on view at the Peabody Essex Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Birmingham Museum of Art.\n\nThe complete series can also be seen online here .\n\nRachel Himes is a member of NYC-DSA and an incoming PhD student in the department of art history at Columbia.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

But even as I can accept the view that the best we can hope for in the coming weeks is Biden-Harris's promised reprieve from Trumpism's animus-fueled chaos, I remain dismayed by the ubiquitous calls for a \"reckoning\" or a \"collective healing\" that have completely dominated discourse on racial inequality in the months since George Floyd's murder. While I'm sure decent people derive comfort from such phrases, this brand of moralism masks a class politics that offers poor and working-class black and brown people symbolic rather than material rewards.\n\nOur predicament today is obviously far worse than four years ago. But the bleakness of the moment derives not simply from the human tragedies and uncertainties around us. In fact, despite Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton, 2016 offered progressives cause for hope about the future, thanks to the surprising resonance of the Bernie Sanders campaign with voters across partisan lines.\n\nForty-three percent of Democratic primary voters in 2016 responded to Sanders's calls for free higher education, national health care, regulation of Wall Street, and policies intended to encourage the downward redistribution of wealth. This showed that a quarter-century of bipartisan neoliberal policies - which have widened the divide between the rich and everyone else - had not eliminated the potential for a mass egalitarian politics in the United States.\n\nAlthough Sanders's 2020 primary performance was less impressive, the Sanders campaign's imprint on the Democratic electorate - shaped, in no small part, by the unambiguous precarity of Generation Z and millennials - was transparent. At the start of the 2020 Democratic primaries, poll after poll showed a clear majority of Democratic voters, especially those under sixty-five, supported Medicare for All, tuition-free public higher education, and increasing the US minimum wage to a living wage - Sanders's signature platform issues.\n\nAs a result, nearly all of the 2020 Democratic hopefuls declared their support for raising the minimum wage, improving collective bargaining rights, and making college more affordable. And while unabashed centrist Democratic hopefuls like Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, and Joe Biden remained ardently opposed to Medicare for All, the popularity of this issue with voters across partisan lines compelled even figures like Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren to embrace national health insurance - at least for a time.\n\nIf, prior to summer 2020, the impact of Bernie Sanders on Democratic discourse was cause for optimism, the efficacy with which centrist Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden used identity politics to dispatch Sanders was cause for alarm. Attacking Sanders from the right via rhetorically left, identity politics frameworks, centrist Democrats, and even some progressives, identified his platform as an anachronistic class agenda that deflected attention from white racism and its consequences for blacks.\n\nIn 2016, for example, Hillary Clinton asserted that Sanders's calls for stronger banking regulations would not address the \"systemic racism\" that hobbled so many black homeowners - a narrative that shifted attention from Bill Clinton's complicity in the subprime mortgage crisis through deregulation of the banking industry. Falling back on a human-resources-friendly update of \"the Devil made me do it\" defense, Secretary Clinton likewise asserted that the \"implicit bias\" we all share explained her firm embrace of tough-on-crime politics and racist constructs like \"super-predators\" during the 1990s.\n\nIn 2020, Vice President Joe Biden - harmonizing with a narrative advanced by Representative James Clyburn and the Congressional Black Caucus - questioned the commitment of Bernie Sanders to the \"black community\" by, among other things, characterizing Medicare for All as an attempt to erase the legacy of the nation's first black president.\n\nSince the conclusion of the Democratic primaries, discourse on racial inequality has circled the drain of a maudlin anti-racist discourse centered on racial reckonings for the nation's original sin of slavery. If Robin DiAngelo and Ibram Kendi are the most visible apostles in the moral crusade against racism, public intellectual Ta-Nehisi Coates is the movement's prophet in chief. Blending rhetorical militancy with moralistic purple pleading, Coates's 2014 \"The Case for Reparations\" soft-pedaled the demand for reparations to an audience disillusioned with President Obama's post-racial presidency and frustrated by lingering disparities in wealth and the criminal justice system.\n\nCoates's popularity notwithstanding, prior to 2016, the call for reparations was still confined to particular academic circles and the talk show circuit. Two developments created space for reparations to seep into policy discourse.\n\nFirst, the popularity of the Sanders platform revealed mass disaffection with the complicity of the Democrats in the Reagan Revolution. Secondly, Donald Trump's surprise victory over Hillary Clinton, likewise, revealed widening cleavages within the Democratic Party, since the win was made possible by a combination of depressed Democratic turnout and Trump flipping a sufficient number of Obama voters in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin.\n\nIn the wake of Clinton's defeat, Coates's \"The Case for Reparations,\" along with its many sequels, provided the Democratic Party of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama with convenient cover for the damage it inflicted on working-class Americans - white and black alike. Specifically, Coates's insistence that the voters Trump had flipped were motivated, in no small part, by a desire to erase the legacy of the nation's first (neoliberal) black president, complemented the DNC's self-serving election postmortem.\n\nIndeed, Coates and the DNC either ignored or downplayed the disaffection engendered among unionized blue-collar voters by Obama's decision to rescind his support for the Employee Free Choice Act; Obama's active support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership; and his means-tested, Heritage Foundation-inspired Affordable Care Act with its tax on nonprofit union health plans, which - had this provision been implemented - would have been bankrupted to subsidize private, for-profit health insurance. By attributing Trump's victory to the \"bloody heirloom\" of white supremacy, then, the accounts offered by Coates and the DNC obscured the electoral consequences of the neoliberal policies pursued by Obama and the Clintons - policies that did real damage to an important segment of Democratic voters.\n\nAlthough Coates ultimately voted for Sanders in 2016, his attacks on the calls made by Sanders for universal and redistributive programs aided and abetted a rightward attack on the kind of class-based policies from which the masses of working-class and poor blacks and Hispanics would disproportionately benefit. Since African Americans are, indeed, overrepresented among the nation's poor and working class, blacks would have benefited disproportionately from Medicare for All, living wage polices, tuition-free public higher education, and a more robust public sector.\n\nTo be clear, I doubt neither Coates's sincerity nor his good intentions. However, his reparations advocacy rests upon a basic mischaracterization of the inadequacies of American liberalism, and that his project - steeped as it is in moralism - is an unwitting call to continue along much the same path that has failed poor and working-class blacks since the 1960s.\n\nThere is no doubt that postwar liberal orthodoxies failed to redress racial disparities. The culprit, however, is not the sway of a metaphysical racism, as Coates argues. Rather, the roots of contemporary disparities can be traced to far more comprehensible forces, including: the tensions within the New Deal between the regulatory and compensatory state models and the related mid-century tensions between industrial and commercial Keynesians; the contrasting influences of the New Deal and the Cold War on the parameters of liberal discourse about race and inequality; and neoliberalism's rise from the ashes of the Keynesian consensus.\n\nIn other words, the failure of postwar and contemporary liberalism is not, as Coates insists, because liberals have long attempted to redress black poverty by reducing racism to class exploitation, resulting in universal policies that focus on economic sources of inequality as an alternative to addressing racism. The problem is that liberals have divorced racial inequality from political economy.\n\nIn fact, liberals have consistently rejected redistributive class-based anti-poverty policies that might address the sources of economic inequality that have, indeed, impacted blacks disproportionately.\n\nInformed by culturalist constructs like ethnic pluralism, the culture of poverty, and underclass ideology, liberal policymakers since the 1960s have generally downplayed or even ignored the disproportionate impact on African Americans of issues such as deindustrialization, the decline of the union movement, and the retreat of the public sector. In the 1960s and '70s, the consequences of this disposition were not so terrible, since the postwar consensus remained in place, causing liberals to pursue anti-poverty policies centered on the expansion of social services and even state-centered regulation of labor relations via affirmative action.\n\nHowever, the breakdown of that consensus and the rise of neoliberalism ensured that Democratic presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama would follow the lead of their Republican counterparts, chipping away at the rights and protections that disproportionately benefitted black Americans, at the very same time as they championed (or personified) diversity.\n\nTo say that postwar and contemporary liberalism have not served most black Americans well is not to deny the historic importance of - or the current need for - antidiscrimination policies. Antidiscrimination legislation such as the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1968 and policies like affirmative action helped improve the lives of many black Americans - my parents and myself among them, just as my grandparents benefited from the GI Bill and New Deal programs.\n\nNevertheless, policies like these have failed to eliminate disparities because earning power for all but the top wage earners has been on a fifty-year decline. As I pointed out in a previous essay, between 1968 and 2016, median black household income increased from the twenty-fifth percentile to the thirty-fifth percentile. Over the same period, median white household income moved from the fifty-fourth to the fifty-seventh percentile. However, despite the relative gains that blacks have made with the aid of antidiscrimination policies, the wage and wealth gap has scarcely budged since 1968. Automation, the slow death of the union movement, and public-sector retrenchment have contributed to a decline in real income for the bottom 80 percent of American workers.\n\nThe good news is that the relative gains blacks have made since 1968 have prevented the racial income gap from worsening. In fact, had African Americans not made any relative progress over the past fifty years, the ratio of median black to white household income would have fallen from 57 percent to 44 percent. The bad news is that the black-white family income ratio would have risen from 57 percent to 70 percent if overall wages had remained constant over the past fifty years.\n\nThe call for \"universal\" programs such as Medicare for All and redistributive class-based reforms - like the Fight for $15, a more robust public sector, a stronger union movement, free public higher education, etc. - is not a denial of the existence of racism. Nor is it an argument for eliminating antidiscrimination policies. But if we don't view racial disparities through the lens of American political economy, we will not only fail to redress income inequality - we will also fail to eliminate black poverty.\n\nThis concern is, of course, at the heart of the problem with Coates's analysis, which mischaracterizes the root causes of the failures of liberalism. Worse yet, the author's moralizing and frequent use of metaphor as an alternative to analysis makes it possible to sidestep solutions. Consider the following passage from \"The Case for Reparations\" on the utility of HR 40:\n\nPerhaps after a serious discussion and debate - the kind that HR 40 proposes - we may find that the country can never fully repay African Americans. But we stand to discover much about ourselves in such a discussion - and that is perhaps what scares us.\n\nInsinuating that the exercise alone has the potential to check racism's eternal sway, he continues:\n\nThe recovering alcoholic may well have to live with his illness the rest of his life. But at least he is not living a drunken lie. . . . What is needed is an airing of family secrets, a settling with old ghosts. What is needed is a healing of the American psyche and the banishment of white guilt.\n\nThe moralistic pitch of \"The Case for Reparations,\" combined with Coates's fuzziness on the difference between anything reasonably understood as reparations on the one hand and torts or charity on the other, led me to the following conclusion in March 2018:\n\nWhereas President Obama's soaring post-racialism licensed the continuation of liberal indifference to the plight of economically marginal people via underclass metaphors, Coates's post-post-racial commitment to racial ontology signs off on white liberal hand-wringing and public displays of guilt as alternatives to practicable solutions to disparities. To be sure, this is not Coates's formal intent, even if the words on the page imply that Coates might find a racial Festivus to be an acceptable alternative to material compensation. But because reparations is a political dead end, Coates is offering white liberals - and even a stratum of conservatives - who are either self-consciously or reflexively committed to neoliberal orthodoxies absolution via public testimony to their privilege and their so-called racial sins.\n\nThe volte-face of conservative columnist David Brooks on reparations is a good example of the issue that I pointed to. Over the past couple of years, Brooks has moved from being a Coates fan who dismissed reparations but appreciated Coates's explorations of \"black rage,\" to a self-identified supporter of reparations - at least as a brand.\n\nIn his March 2019 New York Times op-ed, \"The Case for Reparations,\" Brooks spoke of the necessity of reparations to mend a \"racial divide born out of [the] sin\" of slavery. According to Brooks, bondage did not inflict injury solely upon the slaves themselves: slavery's corrupting influence over our \"whole society\" can still be felt today.\n\nBrooks insisted that the time for a \"racial reckoning\" and the payment of a \"collective debt\" is now. Nevertheless, he still rejected the idea of reparations in the form of a direct cash payments - and did so by quoting the following passage from Coates:\n\nAnd so we must imagine a new country. Reparations - by which I mean the full acceptance of our collective biography and its consequences - is the price we must pay to see ourselves squarely . . . What I'm talking about is more than recompense for past injustice - more than a handout, a payoff, hush money, or a reluctant bribe. What I'm talking about is a national reckoning that would lead to spiritual renewal.\n\nA year later, Brooks elaborated on his vision of reparations in another New York Times op-ed , \"How to Do Reparations Right.\" For Brooks, reparations \"would involve an official apology for centuries of slavery and discrimination and spending to reduce their effects.\" The practicable solutions Brooks advocates center on grants to community leaders - people who have the clearest window onto their communities' needs.\n\nThe conservative columnist acknowledges that his proposal sounds quite like the failed Community Action Programs (CAP) of the War on Poverty, but asserts that CAP failed because it funded disruptive agitators who stirred up conflict between local activists and elected officials. Brooks, by contrast, envisions funding channeled to responsible community leaders only - whatever that means.\n\nOf course, CAP was ultimately doomed to failure because the Johnson administration paid little heed to the disproportionate effects of deindustrialization on blacks and other low-skilled workers. Its anti-poverty agenda eschewed direct job creation in favor of antidiscrimination legislation, cultural tutelage for the black underclass, and tax cuts intended to stimulate economic growth - all of which Brooks has endorsed as well.\n\nSince the 2016 Democratic primaries and the breakthrough of the Sanders campaign, topics that had long been dismissed as pie in the sky have become part of regular discourse. The brutal murders of men and women who are disproportionately black or brown, caught on video, have helped galvanize calls for criminal justice reform.\n\nBut if we view the problems of poverty, health care, and criminal justice through a lens that filters out the political-economic underpinnings of these injustices - informed by the language of moral reckoning - we may just end up with modest reforms at best and symbolic gestures at worst, when what we need is fundamental structural change.\n\nIndeed, the weeks immediately following the police murder of George Floyd by Derek Chauvin opened the floodgates for public displays of racial guilt and penance. Aunt Jemima announced it was changing its brand name, finally acknowledging - as the chief marketing officer of Quaker Foods, Kristin Kroepfl, put it - that it was \"based on a racial stereotype.\"\n\nHundreds of whites in George Floyd's hometown kneeled to ask \"the black community\" for their forgiveness, as efforts to remove the many monuments to treasonous defenders of slavery that mar the Southern landscape gathered pace. Chick-fil-A's conservative Christian CEO, Dan Cathy, called on his fellow parishioners at Atlanta's Passion City Church to repent and fight for black Americans. And about a dozen corporations - with several former American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) members among them - set aside nearly $2 billion for anti-racist initiatives.\n\nTo be sure, the moment of \"racial reckoning\" that lies before us has produced rhetorical interest in reparations among policymakers. Still, Democratic politicians who have insisted on both the righteousness and rightness of reparations - ranging from progressive Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren to Newark mayor Ras Baraka - have merely rebranded means-tested and trickle-down policies as \"reparations.\" In much the same way as David Brooks, Warren, Baraka, and Joe Biden have advocated solutions that sound like a cross between the Johnson administration's War on Poverty and Nixon's black capitalism.\n\nHuman tragedy abounds in this moment, from police violence to COVID-19, and it is good that people are alive to some of the many problems that plague us now. But we need to reason our way out of the misery before us, rather than simply \" feel \" our way through this quagmire. We need to think about the kinds of coalitions our conceptual frameworks will help us forge, and whether those frameworks and coalitions will bring us to our desired ends.\n\nThe fact that former ALEC affiliates can \"embrace\" constructs like \"moral reckonings\" and \"systemic racism\" tells us something vital about where this road will take us. ALEC has drafted model legislation calling for the privatization of public schools and universities, as well as bills that have sought to erode environmental regulations, worker safety, and the right to collective bargaining. ALEC also drafted the model legislation that gave us Florida's \"Stand Your Ground\" laws - which contributed to the murder of Trayvon Martin and ultimately led to the acquittal of George Zimmerman - along with similar legislation in many other states.\n\nWhat kind of democracy do we want to live in? Do we want to live in a democracy where 13 percent of each class layer - rich, middle class, poor - are black, while 90 percent of the population struggles to make ends meet? Or do we want to live in the kind of democracy where no one has to suffer the nagging misery of despair and vulnerability because of stark material inequities?\n\nTouré F.

      "text": "How Black Americans Can Fight Trump's Plot to Capture a Generation of Minds\n\nMother Jones illustration; Legacy Lit\n\nOnly two months into his return to power, President Donald Trump has moved with astonishing speed to achieve his goal of ridding American classrooms of so-called \"radical indoctrination,\" MAGA-speak for educational efforts that prioritize diversity, equity, and inclusion. These actions include threatening to cut public schools' funding unless they scrap DEI initiatives and planning, ever imminently, to launch an executive order to abolish the Department of Education, which would cause irreparable damage to students and educators-especially for those of color.\n\nThe fear around the country has been palpable. As the Department of Education's only civil rights monitor in Alabama, who was fired in February, told my colleague Julia Métraux: \"I'm terrified for the children and adults in my state. I've sat with these children, and I've heard them say, 'We want a better education. We want a better future.' I always had the hope that there [would be] federal enforcement of these laws, and now I'm seeing the dismantling of that enforcement agency.\"\n\nBut as disturbing as they are, Trump's plans are not exactly original. In fact, as Emory University sociology professor Dr. Karida Brown explains in her forthcoming book, The Battle for the Black Mind , the president is following a playbook centuries in the making.\n\nI called Brown to discuss the conservative war on public education and how Black communities can fight for their right to accessible and culturally relevant education.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nLet's discuss the importance of Black students learning about their ancestors.\n\nI've been a college professor for almost 10 years now. I've taught over 1,500 undergraduate students. I understand the responsibility, the weight, and the magic of teachers. We're superheroes and we wield a lot of power.\n\nSo I come to this work from that perspective-and also as a Black woman. Black professors represent just under 4 percent of the professoriate across the country; Black women, less than 2 percent. We are a small but mighty minority, and I know how important it is for all of my students to be able to have the opportunity to experience Black teachers. For many of my students, I'm the only Black professor they will have their whole four years going through college. I also know how important education and children's learning is not just from my profession, but also from my own family's history. My parents, Richard and Arnita Brown, grew up in the Jim Crow South and attended the Lynch Colored School. That's what was etched in stone in the building where they went to school every day, in a segregated community in the coal mining town, where they had separate and unequal education.\n\nThe state mandated that my parents were legally not allowed to be able to benefit from all the resources that were available to their white peers. They came through an education system that was designed to subjugate them, that was designed to make sure that they were second-class citizens.\n\n\"If you capture the school system, you're going to capture a whole generation of minds. You don't have to individually push your agenda. You don't have to go school by school. You just get the whole system.\"\n\nOne of my favorite aspects of the book is how much personal history is woven in. It gave me a sense that as I was learning about this history, I was learning about you as well.\n\nIt also puts into perspective how recent this history is. What are your thoughts on the misconception that because slavery is in the past, it doesn't affect our present?\n\nIt was hard for me to put myself in the book. I'm a very behind-the-scenes writer. (Shout-out to my editor, Krishan Trotman, because she pushed me.) But I realized the book doesn't feel the same way without [my personal history] because it allows me to debunk that myth about our history.\n\nAs for the relative recency of this: If my mother and father are still alive and they went through this, if Ruby Bridges is still alive and has an Instagram page , then it was not that long ago.\n\nWhen you put it that way, it sums it up so perfectly: Ruby Bridges has an Instagram page.\n\nExactly. That biographical engine acts as a throughline throughout the book that allows us to see, yes, how far we've come, but also that this isn't distant history, and it can repeat itself.\n\nYou delve quite a bit into the history of white missionaries using education to forcibly assimilate freed Black people during Reconstruction. Christian nationalism has played a major role in both Trump's campaign and his plans as president. Are there parallels between modern-day Christian nationalists and these missionaries?\n\nWe've got this amalgamation of multiple movements coming together right now, a movement of white evangelical Christian nationalists. We're seeing the religious and political infusion turn into a social movement. It's a well-organized machine that has a long game, that has a playbook, but they're not operating alone. How do these movements build power? There was a cartoon when I was growing up called [Voltron] , and when they all got together, they created a giant robot. That's what these movements do.\n\nYou've got the MAGA movement, but you've also got the technocratic billionaires' boys club combining with American institutions, the media, and the government, all working together to destabilize the school system and create a feedback loop of rhetoric. This works as a playbook that allows everybody to have a role in this whole system.\n\nWhy target our education system?\n\nIf you capture the school system, you're going to capture a whole generation of minds. You don't have to individually push your agenda. You don't have to go school by school. You just get the whole system.\n\n\"The Trump administration has tried to seduce Black Americans to fall into the trap and illusion of Black capitalism. But Republicans are one-trick ponies.\"\n\nOne thing you emphasize in the book is the outsized role that \"white money\" played in funding Black schools, as well as in the shaping of the curriculum at the time. Can you speak a little about that?\n\nThere is an old African American saying: All money ain't good money.\n\nAmerican Big Philanthropy as we know it today originated with education in the South. The two of the first philanthropic organizations that were endowed with over a million dollars in the US were the Peabody Education Fund and the Slater Fund . They both were founded to help establish a Southern education system. The Slater Fund, which was founded in 1882 right after the fall of Reconstruction, solely focused on Black schools. That money was greatly needed, because the Southern states were not going to fund Black schools. You also have the Rockefeller Foundation being born during this time, the Carnegie Corporation being born during this time, and many others. They're all interested in Black segregated schools.\n\nDo disadvantaged Black communities need funding to have equitable resources and education? Absolutely. However, it came with thick strings attached. The first demand that America's billionaires put on those schools was control of the curricula. If a school did not abide by this, you could say goodbye to that grant funding, and that would be the difference for many Black schools over whether they were going to be able to open their doors the next day or whether an entire community of Black children was going to be able to learn.\n\nThat is equivalent to Elon Musk getting on stage today and saying, \"You know, I really want to help Black communities, and I'm going to get together with Jeff Bezos and Peter Thiel, and we're going to set up educational programs in disadvantaged Black communities.\"\n\nTrump often tries to relate to Black audiences in bizarre ways, many of which use capitalism as a tool. For example, his comments about protecting \"Black jobs\" during last year's presidential debate, or inviting several Black rappers to this year's Black History Month reception, many of whom have claimed that Trump will make them richer.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this tactic and the Black conservative leaders who co-sign it?\n\nAs the revolutionary Fred Hampton said , we're not going to liberate ourselves or free ourselves from capitalism. The Trump administration has tried to seduce Black Americans to fall into the trap and illusion of Black capitalism.\n\nBut Republicans are one-trick ponies. They've only got the same four or five plays over and over again. Once you know what they are, then you can see them when they're trying to be used on you to dismantle or disrupt the strategy. What we saw with how Black capitalism was cultivated and used was an effort to try to capture the political imaginations of some African Americans in the post-emancipation, early 20th century.\n\nBlack capitalism in particular has often been used as a carrot by conservative movements to divide and conquer and create chaos within Black communities. They try to cultivate a Black minority group subset to accompany a majority-white conservative movement.\n\nThere are a lot of Black people in America who voted for Donald Trump for those very reasons: \"I might not agree with everything that he's saying, but no politician has done anything for me, and at least I can get rich under Donald Trump.\" This is rhetoric steeped in the logic of wealthing or classing your way out of racial violence, racial terror, authoritarianism, and fascism. In the case of conservative and billionaire boys club movements, they weaponize these tropes and tokenize people to parrot these tropes so that they can poison their own wells. And when they're done with them, they discard them.\n\nWhat happens to tokens? They get spent.\n\nLet's talk about Thomas Jesse Jones, a sociologist who W.E.B. Du Bois dubbed the \"the evil genius of the Negro race.\" In 1916, Jones released a pseudoscientific study arguing against the efficacy of Black-led higher education. That study then launched a disinformation campaign against historically Black schools, with critics treating Jones' bigotry as fact.\n\nTalk to me about the disinformation we see today and the relationship to Jones' efforts .\n\nThis book is the culmination of eight years of archival research. So I've been tracing this man in the archives for almost a decade of my life, and he is sneaky. It's important to note that he was a sociologist. [Jones' influence] is a testament to how powerful the social sciences are and the legitimacy that academics can lend to ideology.\n\nI believe that educators are superheroes, and Thomas Jesse Jones used his superpowers for evil, to sell his science to the highest bidder, toward the aims of ideology and pseudoscience that was meant to cause harm to a whole swath of the American population. A modern example that is analogous to what Jones was doing back then with his billionaire boys club would be PragerU , a conservative right-wing organization that is funded by billionaires from the fracking industry.\n\nPragerU puts out short, digestible conservative propaganda, educational clips that are made to teach parents and children about a \"non-woke curriculum.\" They're rewriting history, framing enslaved Black people as laborers, and softening the histories of disenfranchised, marginalized populations.\n\nIt's offering a script to white parents for how to spot \"wokeism\" and DEI in their child's curricula. Now, why do I point to PragerU when I talk about Thomas Jesse Jones? These are the same kinds of apparatuses of propagandized pseudoscience that are being marketed to a broader public. It's made to stoke latent dispositions of white rage, racism, and anti-Blackness.\n\nWhat are some ways that the average person can detect when they're being fed propaganda?\n\nThe digital age makes this difficult because of the onslaught of information that we are presented. I love TikTok, and I learn a lot from it. But we should not be taking sound bites, tweets, or hot takes without skepticism. It deteriorates our ability for critical thinking and destabilizes our ability to fact-check and do the work of being an informed person.\n\nSo from Thomas Jesse Jones, I learned how important it is to slow down. It's a slippery slope into being tricked into and propagandized into pipelines. If Thomas Jesse Jones were here today, I promise you, he would have a huge TikTok page. He'd be putting out a lot of videos. He'd be on Twitter.\n\nHow will this new political landscape affect Black people looking to become educators?\n\nLanguage is the grease that keeps the system of white supremacy going. One of the roles that this attack on DEI plays in the long game, in the larger strategy, is a fear tactic. Why do I describe it as a fear tactic? Because DEI is being uprooted from its original intention, from its institutionalized meaning and form, uprooted and politicized to mean nothing or any bogeyman that you want it to mean.\n\nWhen you hear conservatives saying, \"DEI must die,\" a lot of times, that just means Black people, places, or things. Sometimes that means anything that's not white, straight, Christian, or male. It can mean anything that the arbiter of that term wants it to mean, and they don't have the responsibility or accountability of defining what they're talking about. That stokes a lot of fear, because who's to know what is DEI and what's not?\n\nThey are threatening violence toward our teachers. They are stoking distrust among educators, intellectuals, and the institutions of higher education. That's very powerful. It does have teeth in this regime. But I want to make it clear: We saw this also in the past.\n\nOne of my favorite portions of the book is the epilogue, where you listed the 10 lessons that we should learn from our ancestors. In these times, I know that I often find myself fighting off feelings of hopelessness. Can you speak about the importance of remaining hopeful when it comes to fighting for Black liberation?\n\nI wrote the epilogue and the last chapter, \"Small Acts,\" the day after the election. I couldn't write the end of the book until I knew what the result was going to be, and I wanted to bring the emotional weight of whatever I was feeling, no matter what the outcome, to the end of the book.\n\nSo that's what you see and that's what you might feel in those last parts of the book. That was a very hard day for a lot of us, but I went back and read the whole rest of the book. I went back to all the other chapters and said, \"What are the lessons? What lessons did they leave us?\" And I didn't find any evidence of nihilism or despair.\n\nIt's CliffsNotes from Mary Smith Peake, who founded that school under an oak tree during the Civil War. Six million Americans are getting ripped to pieces all around you.

And was she sitting there rolling around, crying, saying it's never gonna happen? No, she starts a school, teaching Black people who are escaping and being considered contraband how to read and write, telling them to get ready. Freedom is coming.

      "text": "How a Hostile America Undermined Its Black World War II Veterans\n\nMatthew Delmont November + December 2022 Issue\n\nStaff Sergeant Herbert Ellison explains the GI Bill to a crew of Army truck drivers in 1945. Johnnie Filecia/Library of Congress\n\nIn August 1944, just two months after President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Servicemen's Readjustment Act (a.k.a. the GI Bill of Rights), Harry McAlpin, Washington correspondent for the National Negro Publishers Association, warned that the new law, though race-neutral on its face, would exclude Black veterans. The GI Bill included funding for housing, college, and job training, along with business loans and unemployment insurance, which fueled social mobility for millions of veterans and their descendants. It also included \"innumerable loopholes for states to 'rob' returning Negro veterans of the rights and privileges they have earned by risking their lives and limbs for the preservation (?) of democracy,\" McAlpin wrote.\n\nThis piece is adapted from Half American: The Epic Story of African Americans Fighting World War II at Home and Abroad (Out October 18 from Viking, an imprint of Penguin Publishing Group, a division of Penguin Random House, LLC, all rights reserved).\n\nAuthor photo by Eli Burakian\n\nThis discrimination was by design . Southern Democrats including House Veterans Committee Chairman John Rankin-who a quarter century earlier had penned an editorial ridiculing the notion that military service might somehow elevate a Black man to become the \"peer of the white man\"-took pains to ensure that the bill's benefits would be administered at the state level, where white officials served as gatekeepers.\n\nSure enough, at their local United States Employment Service job centers, Black veterans encountered white counselors who routinely shunted them into unskilled jobs , even if they had military training as carpenters, electricians, mechanics, or welders. In Mississippi, white veterans received 86 percent of the skilled and semiskilled positions, while Black vets filled 92 percent of unskilled and service-­oriented jobs. In Birmingham, Alabama, a USES counselor told Willie May, who had maintained communication lines in the Army Signal Corps, that there were no suitable positions available, even though the counselors had placed several white Signal Corps vets with the Birmingham Power Company. May settled for work as a Pullman porter, which paid far less.\n\nThis gun crew was given the Navy Cross for maintaining their posts after their ship was damaged by enemy fire.\n\nDepartment of Defense/National Archives\n\nThis was an extension of the second-class treatment Black Americans endured as servicemembers, confirming the dreadful suspicion that the freedoms they labored to protect overseas would not be forthcoming at home. As I document in my new book, Half American: The Epic Story of African Americans Fighting World War II at Home and Abroad , from which this essay is adapted, Black volunteers and draftees formed the backbone of a supply effort critical to the Allied victory, and fought courageously in combat when given the opportunity-but were often assigned positions of grunt labor and servitude, building roads and infrastructure or cooking and cleaning for white officers and enlisted men. Black troops nevertheless risked their lives for a segregated military that regarded them with such contempt that, after the Nazis surrendered, US officers let released German POWs socialize and dine alongside white soldiers in areas still off-limits to Blacks.\n\nT-5 William E. Thomas and Pfc. Joseph Jackson, photographed on an Easter morning during the war.\n\nDepartment of Defense/National Archives\n\nThe 41st Engineers perform a color guard ceremony at Ft. Bragg, NC.\n\nOffice for Emergency Management/National Archives\n\nAdding insult to injury, Black veterans returned to a nation less than thankful for their service. White officers and publications belittled or simply ignored Black contributions to the war effort. In the South, Black vets were targeted- and sometimes lynched -by white mobs eager to remind them of their place in the pecking order. Black newspapers printed weekly accounts of violence against vets, many of whom were attacked while in uniform.\n\nYet perhaps even more pernicious were the discriminatory policies of the state , whose ill effects on the Black community spanned generations. Black veterans, like their white comrades, sought out low-interest mortgages and loans, guaranteed by the Veterans Administration, to buy homes and start businesses. Some succeeded, but the vast majority were turned away by the nation's banks, whose racist lending practices were unfettered by the GI Bill. \"Loans to Negro veterans are almost out of the question,\" the National Urban League observed.\n\nThe law, in other words, exacerbated the segregation created and maintained by federal mortgage redlining and white housing covenants. In Mississippi, only two of the more than 3,200 VA-guaranteed home loans issued in 1947 went to Black borrowers.\n\nThings weren't much better up north. Of 67,000 mortgages insured by the VA in the New York and northern New Jersey suburbs that year, fewer than 100 went to nonwhites. Nationally, by 1950, white veterans had received nearly 98 percent of the VA-guaranteed loans.\n\nBlack veterans who managed to get a loan, moreover, faced organized resistance and violence from white homeowners. Just south of San Francisco, white neighbors threatened Army veteran John T. Walker before burning down his newly built home . Across the country, returning servicemembers encountered racial covenants that explicitly blocked them from owning or renting in white areas. A subdivision built for veterans in Albuquerque, New Mexico, was designated whites-only. In Seattle, a covenant restricted the sale of property to \" persons of the Aryan race \"-that was in 1946, one year after the Allies defeated the Nazis with the help of more than 1 million Black servicemembers.\n\nThe 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion in France.\n\nDepartment of Defense/National Archives\n\nAn American MP stands ready in Columbus, Georgia.\n\nDepartment of Defense/National Archives\n\nThe upshot: Black veterans were almost completely locked out of the postwar housing boom and the ability to accrue property equity-the primary conduit by which American families generate wealth and pass it to future generations.\n\nThe GI Bill also enabled millions to attend college, but here again the opportunities differed dramatically along racial lines. Colleges in the North and West admitted only a token few Black students, and Black vets faced interference from racist VA counselors, whose signoff was required to use GI Bill funds for tuition, room, and board.\n\nWhen Tuskegee Airman Monte Posey went to a Chicago VA office for approval to attend the University of Illinois, his counselor insisted there were no professional opportunities for college-educated Black people. Rather than waste time at a university, Posey should sign up for vocational training. (Posey persisted and attended college for two years before leaving to seek full-time work, ultimately as a police officer.)\n\nIn the South, higher education was legally segregated and white colleges outnumbered Black ones by more than five to one, even though a quarter of the region's population was Black. The Black colleges, though dedicated, were chronically underfunded and unequipped to deal with unprecedented demand from servicemembers hungry for a degree. By 1947, as many as 50,000 qualified Black veterans had been turned away.\n\nAll told, 28 percent of white veterans went to college on the GI Bill vs. just 12 percent of Black veterans. So while the legislation did help thousands of Black families take their rightful place in the rising postwar middle class, its discriminatory application significantly widened the overall educational and economic gaps between Black and white Americans. \"The veterans' program,\" concluded the Pittsburgh Courier , a Black newspaper, \"completely failed veterans of minority races.\"\n\nMaintaining the air cleaner of an Army truck in Fort Knox, Kentucky.\n\nAlfred T. Palmer/Library of Congress\n\nIn 1945, during Operation Fire Fly, the Black paratroopers of the 555th Parachute Infantry Battalion made more than 8,000 individual jumps to fight wildfires in the Pacific Northwest. Here they are preparing to jump from a Douglas C-47 on a wildfire in Wallowa Forest, Oregon.\n\nDepartment of Defense/National Archives\n\nMaking matters worse, the military doled out so-called blue discharges -after the colored paper on which they were printed-to more than 10,000 Black servicemembers, rendering them ineligible for benefits. A blue discharge had many of the practical effects of a dishonorable discharge, but could be issued by officers without a court-martial or legal proceeding, and soldiers who were deemed \"troublemakers,\" rightly or wrongly, were pressured into accepting a blue ticket.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Courier called the policy a \"vicious instrument,\" and warned of \"a widespread conspiracy to give blue discharges to as many colored soldiers and sailors as possible.\" Black servicemembers made up less than 7 percent of armed forces personnel, but received 22 percent of the blue discharges from December 1941 through June 1945. That fall, the Pittsburgh Courier advised Black servicemen to reject the blue tickets, and published instructions on how to appeal them.\n\nResearchers from the Institute for Economic and Racial Equity at Brandeis University recently calculated that the GI benefits secured by Black individuals were worth, on average, 40 percent of those whites received. This produced long-term disparities, the study found. By the time WWII veterans hit the age range at which wealth typically peaks, the median net worth of Black veteran households was $100,000 less than that of white ones.\n\nBlack Marines aboard a Coast Guard transport in the Pacific.\n\nDepartment of Transportation/National Archives\n\nRevisited through the lens of race, the GI Bill, long hailed as a powerful engine of class mobility for the Greatest Generation, loses some of its luster. Like the Homestead Acts of the late 1800s, also nominally race-neutral, the legislation harnessed immense public resources to bolster the private wealth of a favored group.\n\nWWII veterans received more than $50 billion under the GI Bill, all told, and the exclusion of Black Americans from the spoils helps explain the vastness of the racial wealth gap today. As of 2019, the median wealth of Black families in the United States was less than 15 percent that of white families-$24,100 vs. $188,200. Black homeownership stood at about 45 percent vs. 75 percent for white Americans. And white families were nearly three times as likely as Black families to have received an inheritance .\n\nThe other way the GI Bill fundamentally shortchanged the nation involves opportunity cost. Black Americans who could take full advantage of the GI Bill often went on to do amazing things. Women's Army Auxiliary Corps veteran Dovey Johnson Roundtree attended Howard University law school, established a law firm in Washington, DC, and then, in a landmark 1955 civil rights case, Sarah Keys v. Carolina Coach Company , helped secure a ban on racial segregation in interstate bus travel. Robert P. Madison was in the 92nd Infantry Division and earned a Purple Heart in combat in Italy. After the war he leveraged the GI Bill to earn architectural degrees from Case Western and Harvard before establishing a trailblazing firm in Cleveland, where he helped design the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nMembers of the 332nd Fighter Group at a briefing in Ramitelli, Italy, March 1945.\n\nToni Frissell/Library of Congress\n\nThese examples only hint at the tremendous cost of excluding Black families from GI benefits. Had all the men and women who dedicated their labor, skills, and courage to the war effort gotten their due, America might today have tens of thousands more Black doctors, lawyers, engineers, professors, economists, scientists, software designers, etc.\n\nLast Veterans Day, in light of this history, Reps. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts and James Clyburn of South Carolina, and Sen. Reverend Raphael Warnock of Georgia introduced the GI Bill Restoration Act , which directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to extend further housing and education assistance to the surviving spouses and direct descendants of Black WWII vets.\n\nMembers of the Headquarters Company, 480th Port Battalion, at the ancient Greek Temple of Neptune.\n\nDepartment of Defense/National Archives\n\nThe legislation remains mired in the House and Senate Veterans' Affairs committees, where it has yet to receive a hearing. Republican lawmakers view it as partisan because it asks them and their constituents to grapple with the legacy of structural racism in America, a subject most would prefer to ignore. Indeed, key committee members have been on the front lines of the culture war against critical race theory, among them Rep. Jim Banks (R-Ind.), who last year urged colleagues to ban the discussion of racism in public school classrooms.\n\nThe Senate Veterans' Affairs committee includes Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), John Boozman (R-Ariz.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), and Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), co-sponsors of the Saving American History Act , which would abolish federal funding for schools that teach the 1619 Project or critical race theory.\n\n\"Enacting meaningful legislation is often a marathon, not a sprint,\" Clyburn told me in a statement provided by his staff. The GI Bill Restoration Act is competing with other priorities, but \"I am committed to working as hard as I can, for as long as I can, to see that the survivors and/or direct descendants of Black World War II veterans realize the promise of the GI Bill denied to their families due to institutionalized discrimination.\"\n\nWomen's Army Corps officers inspect the 6888th Central Postal Director Battalion.\n\nDepartment of Defense/National Archives\n\nTuskegee airmen at Ramitelli, Italy, March 1945.\n\nToni Frissell/Library of Congress\n\n\"Black WWII veterans were robbed of what should have been life-changing opportunities,\" Moulton added in his own statement. \"Not enough Americans realize this-or that surviving veterans and millions of their descendants continue to feel the repercussions today. We introduced this bill not because we knew it would be politically or logistically easy to get passed, but because this is a national conversation that is painfully overdue. We're under no illusions that moving this bill forward will happen overnight.\"\n\nThe act is officially named in honor of Sergeant Joseph Maddox, whom the VA denied benefits for a master's degree program at Harvard University to \"avoid setting a precedent\"-only after the NAACP went to bat for him did the agency relent-and Sergeant Isaac Woodard Jr., a Pacific theater veteran who was still wearing his Army uniform en route to rejoin his family when he was brutally beaten by white police in Batesburg, South Carolina. His eyes were gouged out by a sheriff's nightstick, blinding him for life.\n\n\"Negro veterans that fought in this war don't realize that the real battle has just begun in America,\" Woodard told the Chicago Defender soon after the attack. \"They went overseas and did their duty and now they're home and have to fight another struggle that I think outweighs the war.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Black Lives Matter Began When New Orleans' Levees Failed\n\nVictims of Hurricane Katrina argue with National Guard troops as they try to get on buses headed to Houston on Sept. 1, 2005. Willie Allen Jr./St. Petersburg Times/ZUMA\n\nThis story was first published by Slate and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\n\nOn the fifth anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, in 2010, New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu preached unity . \"With the rising water, differences and divisions were washed away,\" he said, asking the audience to listen to each other, and embrace their common aspirations. \"We will hear and we will learn the beautiful truth that Katrina taught us all,\" he declared, \"We are all the same.\"\n\nWith this, Landrieu invoked our national memory of the hurricane-a catastrophe that devastated New Orleans for all of its residents. In his own address on the fifth anniversary, President Obama struck a similar tone, with a message of rebuilding and harmony. \"Five years ago we saw men and women risking their own safety to save strangers. We saw nurses staying behind to care for the sick and the injured.  We saw families coming home to clean up and rebuild-not just their own homes, but their neighbors' homes, as well.\"\n\nWith the 10-year anniversary this week-Katrina's storm surge breached the levees a decade ago on Saturday-we'll soon see similar rhetoric from politicians and those seeking to pay respect to the storm's victims. Hurricane Katrina was one of the worst disasters in American history: It killed more than 1,800 Americans, displaced tens of thousands more, and destroyed huge swaths of New Orleans. While the government couldn't stop the storm, it could have prepared for the damage. But it didn't. The days and weeks after Katrina were marked with scandalous mismanagement, as the federal government made history with its incompetence and failure. Thousands of New Orleans residents who weren't evacuated and couldn't escape the city were left with inadequate aid and shelter, all but abandoned by officials who couldn't, or in some cases wouldn't , help them.\n\nIn our current remembrance, Katrina is a synonym for dysfunction and disaster, a prime example of when government fails in the worst way possible. It's also a symbol of political collapse. George Bush never recovered from its failure, and \" Brownie, you're doing a heck of a job \" stands with \"Mission Accomplished\" as one of the defining lines of the administration and the era.\n\nBut there's a problem with this capsule summary of Katrina and its place in national memory. It assumes a singular public of \"Americans\" who understand events in broadly similar ways. This public doesn't exist. Instead, in the United States, we have multiple publics defined by a constellation of different boundaries: Geographic, religious, economic, ethnic, and racial. With regards to race, we have two dominant publics: A white one and a black one. Each of them saw Katrina in competing, mutually exclusive ways. And the disaster still haunts black political consciousness in ways that most white Americans have never been able to acknowledge.\n\nWhite Americans saw the storm and its aftermath as a case of bad luck and unprecedented incompetence that spread its pain across the Gulf Coast regardless of race. This is the narrative you see in Landrieu's words and, to some extent, Obama's as well. To black Americans, however, this wasn't an equal opportunity disaster. To them, it was confirmation of America's indifference to black life. \"We have an amazing tolerance for black pain,\" said Rev. Jesse Jackson in an interview after the storm. Rev. Al Sharpton, also echoed the mood among many black Americans: \"I feel that, if it was in another area, with another economic strata and racial makeup, that President Bush would have run out of Crawford a lot quicker and FEMA would have found its way in a lot sooner.\" Even more blunt was rapper Kanye West, who famously told a live national television audience that \"George Bush doesn't care about black people.\"\n\nIn his book Is This America? Katrina as Cultural Trauma , sociologist Ron Eyerman writes that Katrina \"left an indelible mark on American collective memory, not merely as a severe storm but as a social disaster, a catastrophe which revealed the nation at its worst.\" For blacks, this was especially true. In barbershops, at church, and around dinner tables, black people discussed the awful images from New Orleans, where black survivors begged for help from rooftops, and where black bodies floated through streets.\n\nWhen we look at the first 15 years of the twenty-first century, the most defining moment in black America's relationship to its country isn't Election Day 2008; it's Hurricane Katrina. The events of the storm and its aftermath sparked a profound shift among black Americans toward racial pessimism that persists to today, even with Barack Obama in the White House. Black collective memory of Hurricane Katrina, as much as anything else, informs the present movement against police violence, \"Black Lives Matter.\"\n\nAmong the first images of New Orleans after the storm were shots of low-income black Americans, stranded and desperate to escape the floods and debris. In the narrow sense, they were there because the city's evacuation plan-which didn't account for massive traffic out of the region- fell apart . Rather than bring remaining New Orleansians out, officials sent them to the Superdome and the convention center, which were quickly overcrowded and undersupplied. In a much broader sense, however, they were there because in a city defined by decades of poverty, segregation, and deep disenfranchisement, poor and working-class blacks (including the elderly, and children) would largely shoulder the burden of the storm.\n\nTo black Americans around the country, this looked like neglect. In an ABC News and Washington Post poll taken shortly after the hurricane, 71 percent of blacks said that New Orleans would have been \"better prepared\" if it were a \"wealthier city with more whites,\" and 76 percent said the federal government would have \"responded faster.\" A Newsweek poll confirmed this sense among black Americans that the government responded slowly because most of the affected people were black. \"I, to this day, believe that if that would have happened in Orange County, California, if that would have happened in South Beach, Miami, it would have been a different response,\" said then Mayor Ray Nagin in a speech to the National Association of Black Journalists, a year after the storm.\n\nOne study-\" F eeling the Pain of My People: Hurricane Katrina, Racial Inequality, and the Psyche of Black America \"-tests the claim that blacks had a heightened and racialized response to Katrina. The authors conclude that \"Despite geographic and socioeconomic differences, black Americans throughout the country...identified with Hurricane Katrina's primarily African American victims.\"More so than white Americans, they write, \"blacks were deeply angered and depressed by the events surrounding the hurricane.\"\n\nSupport for the racialized view of Katrina can be seen in the way news outlets and commentators talked about the victims. One study, published a year after the storm, found a connection between mentions of race in news stories and references to survivors as \"refugees,\" a description opposed by many black commentators at the time. Analyzing stories from the period, researchers found exaggerated claims of violence among Katrina victims, as well as grossly inaccurate reports of crime and disorder. In one infamous example of skewed coverage , an Associated Press photo shows a young black man wading through water that has risen to his chest. He's holding a case of soda and pulling a bag. The caption says he had just been \"looting a grocery store.\" A second photo, this time from AFP/Getty Images, shows a white couple in the same situation. The caption says they are shown \"after finding bread and soda from a local grocery store.\" Even worse than this were comments from conservative commentators like Bill O'Reilly of Fox News, who denounced the \"poor in New Orleans\" as \"drug addicted\" and \"thugs\"-with the inescapable conclusion being that they deserved their fates.\n\nIt should be said that black alienation wasn't inevitable. Even with the polls and the coverage, views may have changed if white Americans also perceived black treatment during and after the storm as unfair and racially biased. But that's not what happened.\n\nInstead, white Americans discounted claims of racial bias. According to the Pew Research Center, 77 percent of whites said the government response would have been the same if the victims had been white, and only 32 percent said the event showed that racial inequality was still a major problem (for blacks, 66 percent believed the response would have been faster had the victims been mainly white and 71 percent said it demonstrated racial inequality). Other polls confirmed these findings .\n\nIn addition to disbelief that Katrina was a racial story, research and polling also showed a white public that held survivors in contempt. In a 2006 study that examined white and black attitudes toward Katrina victims, political scientists Leonie Huddy and Stanley Feldman found that 65 percent of white respondents blamed residents and the mayor for being trapped in New Orleans. In a CNN/ USA Today survey, half of all whites said that people who broke into stores and took things were \" mostly criminals ,\" compared to 77 percent of blacks who said they were \"mostly desperate people\" trying to find a way to survive. ( Pew had similar findings .) If you turned to right-wing media, you'd find unvarnished disdain for those left behind in the city.\n\nThe idea that black Americans had a legitimate grievance was dismissed. The result was a collapse in black racial optimism. The year before Katrina, according to Gallup, 68 percent of blacks said race relations were either \"somewhat good\" or \"very good.\" The year after Katrina, that declined to 62 percent. The next year, it declined to 55 percent, the lowest point of the decade. In broader surveys from the Pew Research Center, the period after Katrina is an inflection point , where the percentage of blacks who say they are worse off finally overtakes the percentage who say their lives have improved. Black optimism stayed on a downward trajectory for the three years after Katrina. In another Gallup trend-line, black satisfaction with society dips from a steady 41 percent in 2005, to 37 percent in 2006, to 30 percent in 2007.\n\nWith the recession, there was every sign these trends would continue. But then, Barack Obama made his historic run for the White House, a tangible sign of racial progress.\n\nPublic opinion tells the story. In June 2007, just 11 percent of black Americans said they were satisfied with the state of the nation and 30 percent said they were satisfied with the way blacks were treated. Just four months before the election, 78 percent of blacks said racism was widespread . A year later, blacks were far rosier about the future. \"Despite the bad economy, blacks' assessments about the state of black progress in America have improved more dramatically during the past two years than at any time in the past quarter century,\" noted Pew , in a survey that showed black optimism at a high of 39 percent, nearly double what it was two years earlier. The black/white gap in how race relations are viewed also narrowed considerably in the immediate aftermath of Obama's election.\n\nThere is a natural question in all of this. If Barack Obama sparked such a significant shift in black opinion, isn't his election the key point in black political consciousness and not Katrina? The answer is straightforward: No, because the euphoria didn't last.\n\nSince 2012, but especially since last year, a rapid and steady succession of high profile shootings has moved black opinion to its pre-Obama, post-Katrina state of pessimism. Between the incidents and the outcomes-where shooters escape with little punishment or sanction-blacks have become more pessimistic about their place in American life. From 2009 to 2013, notes a Pew survey taken on the fiftieth anniversary of the March on Washington, the percentage of blacks who felt a sense of progress dropped from 39 percent to 26 percent. As of this summer, reports the New York Times , just 28 percent of black Americans say race relations are generally good , which is in line with where they were in the months before Obama's election.\n\nThe Obama surge in black optimism is over. Now, black Americans are back to their post-Katrina consensus; a deep sense that America is indifferent to their lives and livelihoods. Indeed, when read in that light, a movement like Black Lives Matter seems inevitable. The disaster of Hurricane Katrina, and its impact on the collective experience of black America, sowed the ground for a reckoning. Yes, Obama's election postponed it for a time, but the recent eruption of black death-at the hands of the state-gave it new urgency. And now, as we can all see, it's here.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Pandemic Prompts More Black Americans to Take Up Urban Gardening to End \"Food Apartheid\"\n\nJamie Edwards tends an urban garden that was a vacant lot in North St. Louis on Nov. 12, 2021. Edwards said she's had to overcome escalating costs and accidental demolitions as she tries to feed the community. Wiley Price/St. Louis American\n\nThis story is part of \" Barren Mile: COVID-19 and the fight against food apartheid ,\" the result of a Report for America initiative that brought together four Black-owned newsrooms- New York Amsterdam News , the Atlanta Voice , St. Louis American and Black Voice News in California - to look at how COVID-19 impacted food insecurity in their communities.\n\nBefore coronavirus shutdowns gave Mike Daniels an unexpected furlough, he hadn't thought much about urban gardening, though he'd heard as a youngster about his great grandmother tilling the soil. Yet weeks into the pandemic, the former bowling alley attendant turned his Lawton, Oklahoma, backyard into a \"mini-food forest,\" feeding family and friends with zucchini, tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers.\n\nMore recently, he conscripted a vacant third-acre lot owned by a friend near an area defined by the US Agriculture Department as having low access to healthy food. Daniels, who is African American, said he plans to convert the plot into a community garden by next spring to fill what he sees as a \"void.\" \"I feel like it's necessary,\" he added, excitement evident in his voice. \"My plans are pretty much to feed the community.\"\n\nWhen the pandemic exposed gaping holes in the nation's food safety net, community organizations, nonprofits, and the federal government scrambled to head off what loomed as a major food catastrophe. In 2020, one in four Black residents across the US experienced food insecurity-more than three times the rate for white households-according to Feeding America, the nation's largest charitable hunger-relief organization. The USDA, which maintains a map of low-income census tracts in which there is low access to healthy food, pegged the rate of food insecurity for Black households in 2020 at 21.7 percent, more than double the national average rate of 10.5 percent.\n\nYet just as the coronavirus laid bare these inequities decades in the making, it invigorated Blacks already in urban agriculture to expand and drew in new recruits, all aiming to create home-grown solutions to the redlining-induced problem of limited access to healthy foods.\n\nThat keener focus on access, along with the broader racial reckoning wrought by the videotaped murder of George Floyd, has given food justice activists more ammunition. They are targeting not just the absence of retailers but also, and more pointedly, what they see as the systemic racism vexing bereft neighborhoods colloquially known as \"food deserts\" but which they call sites of \"food apartheid.\"\n\nAfter decades of seeing tax credits thrown at corporate-owned grocery stores, both planters and activists are pushing for a more sustainable solution to healthy food access, one that casts people of color in directorship roles and leads to what activists call \"food sovereignty.\"\n\n\"Black people in urban areas are currently and increasingly interested in controlling our food system and resisting the violence that our people experience through the corporate-controlled food system,\" said Dara Cooper, co-founder of the National Black Food and Justice Alliance, a coalition focused on \"creating a just food and land revolution.\" \"I'm not saying we don't want access to grocery stores,\" Cooper added, \"but my point is we want deeper solutions.\"\n\nOn street corners and in vacant lots across the nation, self-help efforts were made visible as green shoots. More than 25 percent of consumers surveyed in Packaged Facts' 2020 national online consumer survey said they were planting a food garden because of the pandemic.\n\nMany groups looking specifically to help Black Americans get a shovel in the ground also say they have seen exponential growth during the pandemic. Bryan Ibrafall Wright, founder of the Black Urban Gardening Society based in Oklahoma City, said his group, which focuses on \"sustainability in the Black community\" has had \"easily\" over 30,000 membership inquiries since the beginning of the pandemic. The 4-year-old group has accepted about 5,000 new members.\n\nDaris Lee, 49, a staff member at Bonton Farms in South Dallas, says the farm helped get him off the streets, offered him a job, and gave him a place to live. The farm-which employs men in the community who had recently gotten out of prison and are looking for jobs-works to address not just food insecurity, but economic stability, affordable housing, reliable transportation, and more within the Bonton community of South Dallas, Texas.\n\nKeren Carrión/GroundTruth Project\n\n\"Many of our members are in low-income communities and they look to agriculture as a means to supplement their diets, their incomes as well,\" he said.\n\nLeah Penniman, co-director of Soul Fire in the City, an urban ag program in the Albany and Troy areas in New York State, saw a more than five-fold increase in participation in that program since the pandemic's onset. Initially, \"we went from 10 families [per] year in the program to 50 families,\" Penniman said, noting that the backyard urban gardening program provides participants with raised beds, soil, and supplies, and helps \"teach folks to grow their own food.\"\n\nThe number of families recently has grown to 70. All are people of color and have low incomes. About 85 percent are Black, including African Americans. \"Since Black folks were and are disproportionately impacted by COVID, it makes sense to see an increase in urban gardening participation at this time,\" she said.\n\nOf course, Blacks have been linked to American soil since before a patch of disparate communities became states united. Even after the post-slavery US government went back on its promise of 40 acres and a mule, African Americans have tried to coax a livelihood from the dirt.\n\n\"Statistically, Black farmers are still underrepresented and under-supported in comparison to their white counterparts,\" said LeeAnn C. Morrissette of the National Black Food & Justice Alliance. In 2017, there were 35,470 farms in the US with Black or African American producers, less than 2 percent of all US farms, according to the most recent census of agriculture .\n\nIt's also a fraction of the historical census of Black farmers. In 1920, of the 6.5 million US farm operators, nearly a million were Black, compared with 5.5 million whites, according to the USDA. Since then, African American participation declined steadily, as Black farmers faced discrimination from the USDA.\n\nClaims against the US government got a very public airing during a class-action lawsuit, known as Pigford , that alleged that the USDA discriminated against African Americans who applied for farm loans or other farm benefits between Jan. 1, 1981, and Dec. 31, 1996. In 1999, that case led to what was described as the largest civil rights class action settlement in US history. But many Black farmers still had trouble accessing their settlement benefits, according to media reports.\n\nMeanwhile, billions of dollars in debt forgiveness for farmers of color were included as part of pandemic relief. But a judge has put the money on hold following lawsuits filed by white farmers claiming that the program amounts to reverse discrimination, according to John Wesley Boyd Jr. , president of the National Black Farmer's Association. In a segment on Good Morning America , he argued that the backers of the lawsuits \"should be ashamed of themselves...they don't know what discrimination is.\"\n\n\"Black people have been slaves,\" he said. \"We've been sharecroppers and survived through horrific laws of Jim Crow...And we've been discriminated against from a systematic standpoint, at the United States Department of Agriculture, and it's time for those things to change.\"\n\nThe sense that the harm done to people of color, both food producers and consumers, is systematic and not just happenstance or naturally occurring, is behind not only the ire of Black farmers but also of activists working to change the food access narrative, beginning with a change of names.\n\nA review of \"food deserts\" on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website noted the earliest use of the term was said to be in Scotland in the early 1990s, where it was used to describe limited access to an affordable and healthy diet. The phrase caught on in the US and became shorthand for low-income urban areas with high concentrations of people of color and the distinct dearth of traditional grocers.\n\nBut in recent years, the USDA changed the name of its former \"Food Desert Locator\" map to the Food Access Research Atlas . It has not officially used the term \"food desert\" since 2013, pivoting to the more clinical \"low-income and low-access\" to designate areas with limited access to healthy food because it \"more accurately reflects what is statistically measured in the Food Access Research Atlas,\" a USDA spokeswoman said.\n\nThat verbiage, activists say, omits what they see as a crucial feature of the corporate and political policies that led to the current landscape: racism.\n\n\"The term 'food deserts' ended up erasing the particular anti-Blackness behind what was happening with the corporate control system,\" noted Cooper of the Food and Justice Alliance. \"And a lot of the solutions that followed were based on a flawed analysis.\"\n\n\"Apartheid conjures a more accurate picture of the disparities that we're addressing and it also points to the intentionality behind the conditions that Black communities are experiencing within the food systems, the mainstream corporate-controlled food system,\" Cooper added. She said she hopes using terms like food apartheid and food redlining \"draws our attention to the root causes, and [gets] us to think deeper about the violent separation of Black people from the means to feed our community.\"\n\nBrian Lang, director of healthy food access programs at The Food Trust, a Philadelphia-based nonprofit, sees the terminology used to describe unequal access as \"incredibly important.\" He prefers the term \"food redlining,\" a nod to the decades-long denial of loans in areas with high concentrations of low-income people of color.\n\n\"Deserts are naturally occurring phenomenon, right, that just kind of happen in the world because of a set of environmental conditions,\" he said. \"And so in that sense, using the analogy of a desert to talk about communities, in cities and in rural areas that didn't have grocery stores didn't feel right to me, because what we saw in those places was the result of market forces, as well as public policy choices which are not the same thing as weather patterns.\"\n\nWhen accused of abandoning low-income areas, grocers, who operate on notoriously thin margins, routinely point to profit and loss statements that guide them to open in areas with higher incomes and steady foot traffic. One of the largest food trade groups is FMI, the Food Industry Association, which describes itself as the \"champion for feeding families and enriching lives with nutritious, safe, and affordable food at retail.\"\n\nSpokeswoman Heather Garlich said in a statement that \"grocers are open to feedback and conversations to better meet the needs of the neighborhoods in which they serve,\" adding, \"our industry embraces community in every way possible.\" She did not answer questions about the neighborhoods grocers abandon.\n\nThat corporate abnegation has led community members to cultivate their own solutions, with varying degrees of government assistance and varying degrees of success.\n\nIn urban areas, where backyards may be small and vacant lots plentiful, a fresh crop of gardeners and farmers has taken root. Before the pandemic hit, Jamie Edwards took a $2,000 bonus she earned while working at Amazon and plowed it into a small garden on land leased from St. Louis on the city's north side, just up the road from a pawn shop, an auto parts store, and an area deemed \"low access\" by the USDA. The money went to pay for eight cubic yards worth of compost, woven fabric for weed control, and other supplies.\n\n\"The area is not the safest area...you have all kinds of things going on around you,\" she said of the neighborhood marked by boarded-up homes and some residents whose incomes dip below the poverty threshold. \"But this is where the need for food justice is going on.\"\n\nFollowing a series of mishaps-from lost paperwork in the St. Louis office tasked with administering the lease to having the young garden accidentally demolished twice-Edwards opted to move her efforts to another city-owned lot about five miles away. Her nonprofit, City Blossoms, offered to buy the new lot but was rebuffed because Edwards is not a city of St. Louis resident.\n\nEdwards, who lives just outside the city limits but has family in the neighborhood, said she remains committed to the gardening project but has found the process of getting up and running more hurdle-filled than she'd hoped.\n\n\"Due to the pandemic, wood prices are astronomical,\" she said, doing mental calculations on her costs thus far. \"Again, another expense. The everyday person that's living in the city can't afford...if they can't afford the food, how do you think they're going to afford the stuff to put the garden together?\"\n\nAbout 10 miles north of Jamie Edwards' produce plot, in St. Louis' Spanish Lake neighborhood, Janett Lewis recently was celebrating a win for her Rustic Roots, a community garden Lewis said sprouted in place of a former \"nuisance\" property. Lewis had been turned down earlier this year for a zoning change that would allow farming in the urban neighborhood. Now, with backing from her local councilwoman, Lewis is hopeful the logjam will be busted.\n\nThat assistance aside, she too expressed concern about the number of stumbling blocks placed between hope and harvest. \"Do I feel things could be improved in the government in general? Yes. I think legislation can be introduced that lessens restrictions on urban farmers and community gardens in [low-income areas]. If food access is an issue we should be doing everything we can to support growers.\"\n\nKimberly Calvin, a city council member in San Bernardino, California, recognized the growing role of community gardens both as an elected official and as a practitioner. She founded a nonprofit called Akoma Unity Center and with volunteers and youth from the center, operates the Shirrell's Community Garden in San Bernardino.\n\n\"All over the city you see community gardens that are growing in vacant spaces, and the interest and the concern for folks who were already doing this type of work, now have a larger platform in order to get the rest of the community to understand-look, we have to be sustainable, we have to be resilient in our own resources,\" Calvin said.\n\nTosha Phonix of St. Louis-based EVOLVE, a food justice advocacy group, would like to see more retailers purchase produce from Black urban farmers to support those businesses and foster more of a connection between residents and growers. It's an effort that's yet to bear fruit.\n\nPenniman of Soul Fire Farm sees community plantings as a way to \"fill gaps in food access while bolstering longer-term food sovereignty.\"\n\n\"Before, during, and after the pandemic, food apartheid continues and will continue to disproportionately impact BIPOC communities, who now also face higher vulnerability to COVID-19 due to such factors as shared housing, lack of access to health care, environmental racism, job layoffs, immigration status, employment in the wage economy without worker protections, and more,\" Penniman said. \"We acknowledge that provision gardens are one strategy to strengthen community food sovereignty and they must be accompanied by systems and policy change.\"\n\nKaren Robinson-Jacobs is the St. Louis American /Type Investigations business reporter and a Report for America corps member.

      "text": "It's Been 50 Years Since MLK Jr. Declared War on Poverty. The Economy for Black Americans Still Stinks.\n\nHorace Cort/AP\n\nAs Americans reflect on the first Martin Luther King Jr. Day of the Trump administration and prepare for the fiftieth anniversary of his assassination, it's as good a time as any to measure our world against the one Dr. King dared us to imagine.\n\nIn the months leading up to the April day in Memphis when he was shot dead by a white supremacist after standing with striking sanitation workers, King had grown increasingly outspoken on issues of class, income inequality, and economic justice. Along with other leading lights of the civil rights movement, he had just launched the Poor People's Campaign against what he termed the \"giant triplets of racism, extreme materialism, and militarism.\" It is in the statements and writings of his final months where we find the fullest expression of King's political and economic vision, and a guidepost for our current assessments.\n\nFor black Americans in particular, the odds of achieving equal economic footing remain, in many ways, as dim as they were in the years leading up to 1968. Sweeping across the Bible Belt to promote his anti-poverty campaign, King issued a stinging criticism against a status quo that left black people \"penniless and illiterate\" in the country they had built.\n\nFifty years later, on everything from hourly wages to household income to family wealth, black people remain miles behind their white counterparts.\n\nThis chart from The Economic Policy Institute illustrates the point:\n\nAt $14.92 per hour, the median black worker currently earns just 75 percent of the $19.79 that their white counterpart earns. On the income front, the median black household is bringing down just 61 percent of the total median white household, about $39,500 versus $65,000 annually. That's slightly improved from the gap in 1967, when the median black household earned just 55 percent of white household income. But in absolute terms, the racial income gap has grown by more than $5,000 since the year King called for \"a radical redistribution of economic and political power.\"\n\nMoreover, the wealth gap between black and white families is more like a yawning chasm. The most widely cited data on this comes from the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances , which shows that the median white family is worth 10 times more than the median black one, ($171,000 and $17,600, respectively). On the surface, that's actually an improvement since 1963, the year King led the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, when the median white family was worth 19 times the median nonwhite one.\n\nYet under a less generous model employed by the Institute for Policy Studies (but perhaps more accurate since it excludes the falling value of the family car), the median white family ($151,800) is worth over 35 times the median black one ($4,300). More damningly, a recent report from the institute finds that 30 percent of black households have \"zero or negative wealth,\" with median black household wealth on a collision course to hit $0 by 2053.\n\n\"In the human rights revolution,\" King remarked in his final speech, \"if something isn't done and done in a hurry, to bring the colored peoples of the world out of their long years of poverty, their long years of hurt and neglect, the whole world is doomed.\" Nearly 50 years later, scores of black families remain nearly penniless, with untold others at risk of the same.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Black People Are Dying From COVID-19 at Higher Rates Because Racism Is a Preexisting Condition\n\nErica Harris and her daughter Jordan wear their protective masks as they walk home on Chicago's South Side. Charles Rex Arbogast/AP\n\nA few weeks ago, a thought woke Camara Jones up in the middle of the night. It was about the coronavirus. That's commonplace these days, but Jones is a family physician and epidemiologist who worked at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where among other things she studied racial bias in the medical system. Her thoughts on a pandemic are anything but commonplace.\n\nThe coronavirus had revealed something essential about the workings of race in America. \"The thought that woke me up,\" she told me over the weekend, \"is that the most profound aspects of racism operate without bias and without stigma.\" What she means is that racism in its most pernicious form slides by on deniability, without any of the telltale oafishness with which more ordinary forms of prejudice announce themselves. Left in its wake are lopsided outcomes that are made to look like the natural order of things.\n\nNothing illustrates that dynamic better than a pandemic that is wrongly said to be \"the great equalizer.\"\n\n\"This disease,\" she says, \"is not an equal-opportunity disease.\" Black people are contracting the coronavirus and dying from the disease at higher rates than other people. This disproportionate effect is a social issue in the guise of an epidemiological one. Black Americans, particularly in the Southern states that have not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, are more likely to be uninsured. They're more likely to work a low-paying job. They're more likely to suffer from heart disease , asthma , cancer , and other conditions, not-as Jones takes pains to emphasize-because of biology. It's because of straightforward social choices such as where toxic dumps get sited, where new highways get built, and where Black people have historically been permitted to live.\n\nIt will be hard to fully grasp the scale of disparities in coronavirus outcomes. Cities and states thus far have been slow to collect data by race and ethnicity. From what we know now, though, the pattern is troubling. In Chicago , for instance, 69 percent of people who have died from the coronavirus as of April 8 are Black, even though they make up 32 percent of the city's population. In Michigan, where an outbreak has gripped Detroit and where Black people make up 14 percent of the population, they represent 40 percent of deaths. In Louisiana, where an outbreak has rattled the New Orleans area, 70 percent of those who have died are Black. In Alabama , Black people make up 27 percent of the state's population but 52 percent of those who have died from coronavirus. In Mississippi, where Black people make up 38 percent of the population, they make up 56 percent of coronavirus infections and 72 percent of deaths. And as ProPublica reported, Black residents in Milwaukee County , who make up 26 percent of the county's population, constitute half of its COVID cases and 81 percent of its deaths.\n\nIn New York City, Black residents make up 22 percent of the population and 28 percent of deaths. In Los Angeles, though early data is limited, Los Angeles County public health director Barbara Ferrer reports that Black people \"have a slightly higher rate of death than other races.\"\n\nJones sees the effects of racism everywhere in the coronavirus outbreak. She points to the way the disease has ravaged jails and prisons, which are disproportionately Black because of disproportionate policing. In Chicago, for instance, 238 inmates and counting at Cook County Jail have contracted the disease. In Louisiana, five people have died of coronavirus as 42 inmates and staffers have contracted the disease. At the jail complex in New York's Rikers Island , more than 160 inmates have contracted the disease, including one who died while serving a parole violation.\n\nI spoke to Jones over the weekend about how the coronavirus has pulled the cover off the preexisting condition of American racism. The transcript below has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhat has stood out to you so far as we've watched the coronavirus pandemic unfold?\n\nWhat the COVID-19 pandemic is unveiling is the structural racism, which is why we see people of color and poor people more profoundly impacted. This virus is an equal-opportunity virus, but this disease is not an equal-opportunity disease, and it's manifesting itself more severely in people of color who've been historically oppressed and disinvested.\n\nSo the way that you need to talk about racism in this time is to explain, to make it clear to everybody looking at this, that it's not some kind of inherent weakness of African Americans that's making them die more frequently of the disease than other people in Milwaukee, in Detroit. That is an impact of racism, so what we need to do is un-invisiblize structural racism and say this structural racism and the historical federal partitioning of our cities into racially segregated neighborhoods, the disproportionate placement of toxic dump sites, that stuff which is giving us more asthma, more lung disease, or the HIV epidemic-these are the old aspects of racism showing up during this pandemic.\n\nWe have already seen some of those in terms of the stigmatization of Asian people. But as anti-racist activists, this is the time for us to say that what has previously been invisible to many is now manifest. It's not a result of poor people being weaker than, having bad habits, being stupid or lazy or anything. This is racism showing up. We need to name what we are starting to show in our statistics. We need to label the racism that it is.\n\nHow do you public health officials go about doing that?\n\nBy talking about the racial/ethnic health disparities that many people in this country aren't even aware of. Many are not aware that Black people are more likely to have heart disease and kidney disease and be obese and have diabetes. So to talk about the so-called preexisting conditions that are putting people at higher risk-that these things are because of the conditions of our lives. It just so happens that people of color have more of these diseases, and that they are having worse outcomes, but there's nothing biological about race. Race is the social interpretation of how we look in a race-conscious society, and racism is the system that operates on that so-called race to structure opportunity and to assign value.\n\nTo what extent have you seen public health officials address this racism?\n\nI know that Barbara Ferrer, when she was here in Boston, we worked together a lot and she was very much anti-racist. When she was the head of the Boston Public Health Commission, every single employee went through anti-racism training. Every single training was half people from the health department and half community people. It took a long time, but her commitment to having people understand racism as a root cause of racial health disparities was clear. So I don't know what she's doing. I don't know [if] she's naming racism yet or she's being very clear about collecting and showing data by race/ethnicity. That would be one way that a health director would do it. It doesn't just happen that Milwaukee had the statistics and reported the statistics. Two years ago, Milwaukee County declared racism to be a public health crisis. The health department did that because the Wisconsin Public Health Association did that, and the Wisconsin Public Health Association did that because, when I was president of the American Public Health Association, I launched our association on a national campaign against racism and I went around to 25 of our 54 state affiliates talking about that. The Wisconsin Public Health Association said that racism was a public health crisis and then Milwaukee County took that.\n\nThat is why Milwaukee was the first one to put these data up. A health department person who has never said the word racism, they are not in this crisis all of a sudden going to jump all the way to understanding that racism is at the root of disparate outcomes, disparate testing, disparate hospitalizations, disparate access to ventilators. They may not have that. But the people who understand how racism works and that racism is a root cause, a fundamental cause of our so-called racial health disparities, now understand that the health disparities are really disadvantaging people in two ways. It's making them get the disease worse, and then at the point where there's gonna be rationing decisions made, God forbid, those same comorbidities, preexisting conditions might disqualify those people who have greater need from getting access to the life-saving therapies that they need. That was certainly the case in Italy, where I believe that they were using age and comorbidities as rationing criteria.\n\nSo I'm understanding what you're saying here: There's a fear there that because of these preexisting conditions, folks who disproportionately have those conditions, which are people of color and poor folks, that that could play into the ultimate decision-making of who lives and who dies.\n\nRight. It's playing in two ways. It's making people sicker. You know, some people get the virus and don't even experience symptoms, and some people get the virus and they get very sick. And people who have preexisting conditions are more likely to get very sick. So now they go to the hospital. The fear is, and in Italy, the reality was, that the very fact that they have diabetes or they have chronic lung disease or hypertension or some other kind of heart issue, that those things are going to be counted against them if a decision has to be made of which of these patients get the last ventilator.\n\nSo it's a double whammy that we cannot let be. If you were to disqualify people or even ding them a little bit in terms of a priority- based on preexisting conditions, that will systematically disadvantage people of color in this country. That will be the ultimate expression of racism in the distant, hands-off kind of way. So it's not about the stigma. It's going to perhaps be about the criteria. We're applying these criteria evenly to everybody, but without recognizing that the historical injustices that have made themselves evident in people's health status is not evenly distributed.\n\nThe most important ways that racism is showing, has always shown up, and will continue to show up in this pandemic is not about stigma or name-calling or any of that. It's about life-and-death decisions. It's about historical disadvantages that we as a nation haven't even recognized because we're ahistorical. We act as if people have equal opportunity. We act as if the present, we're disconnected from the past. I have seven different barriers like that, that I have distilled as barriers to achieving health equity. All of these are manifesting big time in this pandemic, and they don't require interpersonal expressions of bias or discrimination. They're baked into the system.\n\n[Jones later emailed me her seven \"societal\" or \"cultural\" barriers to achieving health equity. They are: a \"narrow focus on the individual,\" an \"ahistorical stance,\" the \"myth of meritocracy,\" the \"myth of a zero-sum game,\" a \"limited future orientation,\" the \"myth of American exceptionalism,\" and \"white supremacist ideology.\"]\n\nSo scapegoating would manifest itself in devaluing somebody's life when you have to make a life-or-death decision about them: When you have to decide as an EMT whether or not you are going to put this person in your ambulance and take them to the hospital, when you have to decide in the emergency department if you're even going to intubate that patient and send them up to the ICU or not. So the scapegoating and the stigma also are going to be manifest through individual decisionmaking, where how an individual values the other person is going to play a part. But what I keep getting back to is that that's going to play a much smaller part than all of the structural racism that is written into our bodies.\n\nHow are you seeing that structural racism play out as you think about the early data. You pointed to the ProPublica story. Are there particular places or ways that you're seeing this structural racism play out?\n\nYeah, in the jails and prisons. Many people are held in jails because they can't make bond and so then there's a big push right now for decarceration But also in the prisons, where people of color are hugely overrepresented and the prisons are crowded. That's another manifestation of structural racism categorically putting some populations at higher risks than others.\n\nIt's not even the preexisting conditions anymore. It's the housing or lack thereof. It's the detention and detention centers and the like, and the disregard. That has to do with the values piece. It's not a new values piece. It's as if people do not recognize the genius that is locked away in our prisons and in our detention centers, so we don't value those people and we're just locking them away as if they could do very well without those people. Now we're acting as if there's a big epidemic inside a prison, oh well. That is a values piece that is becoming more vivid when we know that just one guard needs to come in there with COVID-19 asymptomatic and everybody's going to be harmed. Then when you think about housing-again the structural racism is not just how it has made us have more preexisting conditions; it's also where we find ourselves. Do we find ourselves unhoused? Do we find ourselves incarcerated? Do we find ourselves crowded in living quarters? Do we find ourselves with very tenuous jobs? Do we find ourselves with the jobs of home health aides continuing to take care of elderly people and the like, and needing those jobs? Do we find ourselves with the low-paid health worker jobs in the hospitals? Do we find ourselves cleaning up the rooms and the ICUs? Do we find ourselves taking the recently deceased bodies to the refrigerator truck? So it's not just about what happens in individual bodies, but also where do we find our bodies?\n\nWhat have you noticed in this pandemic, given the messaging from Washington? What have you noticed in terms of whether federal health officials are paying mind to all sorts of communities?\n\nIt's rough. I don't know what's going on over there at the CDC. It is mind-boggling. [Laughs.] I mean, this is what we're supposed to be leading. I mean, Tony Fauci is fabulous. He's NIH, infectious diseases. But the whole approach to this pandemic in the US has been a very clinical approach narrowly focused on the individual and not at all the kind of public health population-based approach that we need, especially when it comes to testing. Maybe it was two weeks ago-I think it was two Sundays ago-I was listening to one of the shows, you know, the show that comes on every afternoon. You know what I'm talking about? [Laughs.]\n\nI know exactly which one.\n\nAnd I believe that the president said something like, they were about to announce that they were going to restrict testing to only those who are already hospitalized and maybe frontline people. They loosened that up again, but at that time they were saying that unless you were sick enough to already be hospitalized, you would not be able to get a test.\n\nThat is exactly the wrong approach. What that does is set a narrow, individually focused clinical approach where what you're trying to confirm is a diagnosis that you already highly suspect. And confirming a diagnosis is good because if somebody doesn't have COVID-19, if they have bacterial pneumonia, you want to treat them for bacterial pneumonia, and if they don't have COVID, you don't have to waste your precious personal protective equipment when you go into that person's room. That's important. But that is only going to be documenting the course of the epidemic. It's never going to equip us to change the course of the epidemic, and a public health approach to testing is all about surveillance.\n\nWhich means that, sure, you can test all of the people who are symptomatic, but you also have to test at least a sample of people who are not symptomatic. You need to do that to know how widespread is the infection in our community today, which will equip you to plan what health resources you're going to need in two weeks. Then it also helps you identify previously unknown infected people and to have them isolate themselves and then to also ask them, who did you get in contact with in the past six, seven days? And then you do that contact testing, you get other people early on in their infections, and then you isolate them. This is how you change the course of the epidemic as opposed to just documenting the epidemic.\n\nThe CDC is the nation's lead public health agency. There are many brilliant people at CDC who know that what I'm saying is absolutely the truth, and they are not satisfied, I'm sure, with just the clinical use of the testing to document the course of the pandemic. They want to influence the course of the pandemic, but we cannot do that without a public health surveillance approach to testing. Why CDC is not making a bigger noise about that, I have no idea. Who put the muzzle on whom? Because there are smart people there. They know this. This is not some aha.\n\nWhat's the impact when you have a president who calls the virus a \"Chinese virus\" and starts to label the virus based on geographic reasoning?\n\nIt's horrible. It has a very bad effect. It makes [Asian Americans] scared, and it makes them understand that they are purposely being made vulnerable, that they are purposely being scapegoated in the same way that he scapegoats Muslims, in the same way that he scapegoats Mexicans. It's another othering. It's another part of his effort to make America white again.\n\nHow does the labeling affect the work of public health officials who have to go out there and combat the epidemic?\n\nI haven't heard anybody saying it is not the Chinese virus or President Trump is wrong to call it the Chinese virus. I think that they just themselves do not call it that, but perhaps the stronger response would be to defy the president in that labeling.\n\nHow does this labeling create fear among those who are labeled?\n\nOn the ground, public health folks know that before December of 2019 there was no person on this Earth who was immune to this virus. So public health people understand that we are all vulnerable. I don't think public health workers are confused about that-all of humanity is at risk, and it's not because of any particular part of humanity. It's because of bats and pangolins. [Laughs.]\n\nRight.\n\nSo public health people on the ground and public health leadership are so far away from the president's frame that maybe they should get a little bit closer to actively defy that frame. But he's stopped doing that now. But I would have to say that public health people who stood up to the president and actively defied him might find that their public health departments or their states were punished. So maybe not defying the labeling is a strategic thing because people know that they need tests and that they need ventilators and PPE.\n\nWhat does an anti-racist initiative look like? How does the strategy around combating that sentiment evolve as the disease evolves, as what we know about the disease evolves?\n\nNow it's not the \"Chinese virus.\" Now it's New Yorkers going down to Florida. So the xenophobia has shifted. Now it's about, \"Don't let those New Yorkers come into your state,\" and the whole 24-hour threat of quarantine, of an active military imposition of a quarantine on New York. So it's about blaming and it's about othering because the president and his supporters do not want to have any blame come back to them. So I would say that the president is racist. He has used many racist tropes before, and so when he would call it the Chinese virus, those were racist tropes again. But as it becomes clear that it can affect anybody, he has moved to the urban trope. You know, \"Okay, New Orleans and Detroit and New York, you don't want those people coming near you, but yes, we can let things open in the Midwest because those kinds of people aren't here and so the virus will never come here\" type of thing. It's going to put his supporters at a severe disadvantage because if they're still thinking this is some kind of hoax, this doesn't mean they should go to as many parties as they want or barbecues or church next Sunday-they're gonna get very sick.\n\nBut he's always deflecting blame. He's loosened up the Chinese part of it. Now that there's going to be data out there about how people of color are overrepresented in terms of stats and all that, who knows, he might start blaming Black folks and Latinx folks. \"You don't want them to come into your neighborhood.\" That's all because he cannot understand that his sluggishness, his lack of future orientation, his narcissism, all of that has made him not act in a time of need. He still isn't fully acting in a time of need but he will never blame himself. The thing he's going to say, I already hear it-the low projections of 1.2 to 2.2 million Americans dying, right? Say that is not the 100,000 to 150,000, say it's 500,000. He is still going to say, \"Oh, because of our actions, we prevented the 2.2 million.\" So he's gonna always play this as a win even though his sluggishness and inaction in the face of need has caused already too many Americans to die. These people did not have to die.\n\nSo in Chicago, 70 percent of the people who have died from COVID are Black. What do you make of that?\n\nTwo things: that we started out sicker, probably in more crowded conditions and not able to work at home. Still have to be Uber driving. Still have to be delivering food to other people. Still have to be at the grocery store. Still have to be the home health aides and the nurses and doctors. I haven't seen these data, but perhaps because of the profound residential segregation by race, which then segregates health resources and the like, they may find themselves in hospitals that don't have enough of what's needed. So it's the three things: worse baseline health, the conditions of our lives and our work, and our access to sufficient health care.\n\nHow does that fit into what we're seeing in other cities?\n\nThis is the distinction that needs to be made. The coronavirus does not discriminate in terms of whom it infects. But the disease discriminates in how profoundly those people are affected. All this did was pull the covers off.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "The Race Gap in US Prisons Is Glaring, and Poverty Is Making it Worse\n\nPrisoners line up to vote at the D.C. Jail in Washington, DC. Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n\nThe American criminal justice system's glaring racial disparities are well known: Black people make up nearly 40 percent of America's incarcerated population and are more than five times as likely as whites to be behind bars. A new paper from the People's Policy Project, a progressive think tank, looks at how economic inequality exacerbates this longstanding racial divide.\n\nUsing data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, which has tracked a representative sample of Americans since the mid-'90s, Nathaniel Lewis finds that the incarceration gap between blacks and whites is primarily driven by economic disparities. He concludes that one's class, more than race, is the single greatest predictor of how likely someone is to land behind bars. Our jails and prisons are mostly filled with America's poor. ( In 2014 , 57 percent of incarcerated men, and 72 percent of incarcerated women had incomes below $22,500 before they were locked away.) Many of them are white, but a stunningly disproportionate share are black.\n\nAs Americans move up the class ladder, their odds of being incarcerated start to drop dramatically. White men in the lowest income quintile have a more than 40 percent probability of ever having been jailed, Lewis finds. In contrast, the probability for white men at the highest income level is 9 percent. Since black people are far likelier to be impoverished or low-income, they're also far likelier to be locked up. The probability that a low-income black man has been jailed is around 52 percent; for an upper-income black man it's 14 percent.\n\nThe roots of black folks' economic disadvantages run deep . Across nearly every measure of economic well-being, black Americans remain years, even decades, behind their white counterparts. The racial wealth gap alone has yawned to point where the black families would need over two centuries to catch up with the wealth amassed by white families. The following chart illustrates the slice of black and white men in each income group, as divided into quintiles. Black men, for example, are more than twice as likely to be in the lowest income quintile than white men; and white men are more than twice as likely to be in the highest.\n\nTo test his thesis, Lewis crafted a counterfactual in which there are no economic differences between white and black men. By taking class out of the picture, we can actually see more clearly how class drives these outcomes in the first place. Once class is removed, the black-white incarceration gap begins to vanish, though never entirely. Lewis calculates that class explains more than half of the difference between the share of black and white men who have been jailed for more than a year, and explains 85 percent of the gap between those who had been jailed after arrest. In other words, if economic background had played no role, far fewer poor black men would be imprisoned.\n\nThe paper does not argue that eradicating economic inequality will vanquish racism or the racism that infects the criminal justice system. What it does argue, in the tradition of scholars like Cedric Johnson , is that the criminal justice system isn't a standalone widget but a piece of a much larger machine. In order to reverse the stunning rate of black incarceration, Lewis finds, we have to address the poverty that pushes so many black people into prison in the first place. He concludes, \"[T]hese disparities are primarily driven by our racialized class system. Therefore, the most effective criminal justice reform may be an egalitarian economic program aimed at flattening the material differences between the classes.\" In other words, while building a more progressive economy won't end the horrors of racism, it may be the pathway to a less discriminatory criminal justice system.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Trump Is Using the Pandemic to Undo Environmental Rules. It's Hurting Black Americans.\n\nLenin Nolly/NurPhoto via ZUMA\n\nUnder the cover of the pandemic, the Trump administration has been hard at work dismantling the rules that protect public health. He has reversed standards for clean cars and mercury emissions from coal plants. He's suspended rigorous environmental reviews required by the Endangered Species Act and National Environmental Policy Act to expedite approval of highways and pipelines in 30 days. And just last week, the Environmental Protection Agency altered how it calculates the lives saved from cleaner air-a devastating change that will be used to undermine future clean air regulation.\n\nThese rollbacks do not affect everyone equally-they're particularly devastating for people of color. And the pandemic has intensified the burden that vulnerable neighborhoods already carry. On Tuesday, in a hearing before the House Energy and Commerce committee, environmentalists and racial justice advocates detailed the compounding effects Trump's rollbacks and pollution has on communities that have been hardest hit by COVID-19.\n\nAccording to CDC data released in April, Black patients accounted for 33 percent of COVID-19 hospitalizations and 23 percent of deaths-disproportionately high numbers when you consider that 18 percent of the total US population identifies as Black. The disparity has been even more stark in some cities: In Washington, D.C., for example, Black people are 45 percent of the population but 76 percent of total COVID-19 deaths.\n\nThe connections between the environment, race, and the COVID-19 crisis are many: Air pollution in poor communities has long caused soaring rates of respiratory and heart disease-underlying conditions that are now worsening outcomes in people who contract COVID-19. The pandemic has also increased people's exposures to pollution: They're spending more time indoors, where outside pollution can seep in and mix with asthma triggers like mold. The lack of federal and state enforcement during the crisis has meant communities may face illegal levels of exposure to chemicals and emissions. And while transportation emissions are down overall, some neighborhoods see more emissions from idling trucks.\n\n\"When we say, 'I Can't Breathe' we literally can't breathe,\" Mustafa Santiago Ali, vice president of Environmental Justice at the National Wildlife Federation, said in his testimony. Jacqueline Patterson, Director of the NAACP Environmental and Climate Justice Program, pointed out in her testimony that 71 percent of African Americans live in counties in violation of federal air pollution standards. \"At every turn the deck is stacked against us.\"\n\nAbundant research reinforces this point: A study published last year in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences found that African American and Latino American populations are typically exposed to 56 percent and 63 percent more PM2.5 pollution than they produce through consumption and daily activities. By contrast, non-Hispanic white people are typically exposed to 17 percent less pollution than they produce.\n\nThe American Lung Association summarizes the literature in its 2020 State of the Air report :\n\nRecent studies have looked at the mortality in the Medicaid population and found that those who live in predominately black or African American communities suffered greater risk of premature death from particle pollution than those who live in communities that are predominately white. Another large study found that Hispanics and Asians, but especially blacks, had a higher risk of premature death from particle pollution than whites did. This study found that income did not drive the differences. Higher-income blacks who had higher income than many whites still faced greater risk than those whites, suggesting that the impact of other factors such as chronic stress as a result of discrimination may be playing a role. Other researchers have found greater risk for African Americans from hazardous air pollutants, including those pollutants that also come from traffic sources. Due to decades of residential segregation, African Americans tend to live where there is greater exposure to air pollution.\n\nMore recent research has found that COVID-19 outcomes are worse in high-pollution communities. In a preliminary study from Harvard in April, researchers found that even small increases in fine particulate matter, known as PM2.5, corresponds to about an 8 percent increase in COVID-19 deaths. People who faced long-term exposure to pollution of 15 to 20 years in 3,080 US counties had much higher death rates from COVID-19.\n\nYet Trump has turned a blind eye to the devastating connections between pollution and the pandemic. In the last week, he's also shortcut environmental reviews so the administration can expedite fossil fuel infrastructure projects, making it easier to build petrochemical plants, incinerators, and toxic dumps at the front steps of communities of color. Despite all this, Trump has spent the last week bragging about his environmental record, claiming, \"We have the cleanest air we've ever had, like over the modern era.\"\n\nThat claim comes as an affront to people who work to clean up the most polluted neighborhoods. Trump's rollbacks are an example of \"the different kinds of ways that they kill us and have been killing us for generations,\" says Elizabeth Yeampierre, executive director of UPROSE, Brooklyn's oldest Latino community-based organization. Environmental regulations, she adds, can \"force protections for those communities,\" but \"when they are eviscerated, people are left with industries that run amok.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "How Black Americans Can Fight Trump's Plot to Capture a Generation of Minds\n\nMother Jones illustration; Legacy Lit\n\nOnly two months into his return to power, President Donald Trump has moved with astonishing speed to achieve his goal of ridding American classrooms of so-called \"radical indoctrination,\" MAGA-speak for educational efforts that prioritize diversity, equity, and inclusion. These actions include threatening to cut public schools' funding unless they scrap DEI initiatives and planning, ever imminently, to launch an executive order to abolish the Department of Education, which would cause irreparable damage to students and educators-especially for those of color.\n\nThe fear around the country has been palpable. As the Department of Education's only civil rights monitor in Alabama, who was fired in February, told my colleague Julia Métraux: \"I'm terrified for the children and adults in my state. I've sat with these children, and I've heard them say, 'We want a better education. We want a better future.' I always had the hope that there [would be] federal enforcement of these laws, and now I'm seeing the dismantling of that enforcement agency.\"\n\nBut as disturbing as they are, Trump's plans are not exactly original. In fact, as Emory University sociology professor Dr. Karida Brown explains in her forthcoming book, The Battle for the Black Mind , the president is following a playbook centuries in the making.\n\nI called Brown to discuss the conservative war on public education and how Black communities can fight for their right to accessible and culturally relevant education.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nLet's discuss the importance of Black students learning about their ancestors.\n\nI've been a college professor for almost 10 years now. I've taught over 1,500 undergraduate students. I understand the responsibility, the weight, and the magic of teachers. We're superheroes and we wield a lot of power.\n\nSo I come to this work from that perspective-and also as a Black woman. Black professors represent just under 4 percent of the professoriate across the country; Black women, less than 2 percent. We are a small but mighty minority, and I know how important it is for all of my students to be able to have the opportunity to experience Black teachers. For many of my students, I'm the only Black professor they will have their whole four years going through college. I also know how important education and children's learning is not just from my profession, but also from my own family's history. My parents, Richard and Arnita Brown, grew up in the Jim Crow South and attended the Lynch Colored School. That's what was etched in stone in the building where they went to school every day, in a segregated community in the coal mining town, where they had separate and unequal education.\n\nThe state mandated that my parents were legally not allowed to be able to benefit from all the resources that were available to their white peers. They came through an education system that was designed to subjugate them, that was designed to make sure that they were second-class citizens.\n\n\"If you capture the school system, you're going to capture a whole generation of minds. You don't have to individually push your agenda. You don't have to go school by school. You just get the whole system.\"\n\nOne of my favorite aspects of the book is how much personal history is woven in. It gave me a sense that as I was learning about this history, I was learning about you as well.\n\nIt also puts into perspective how recent this history is. What are your thoughts on the misconception that because slavery is in the past, it doesn't affect our present?\n\nIt was hard for me to put myself in the book. I'm a very behind-the-scenes writer. (Shout-out to my editor, Krishan Trotman, because she pushed me.) But I realized the book doesn't feel the same way without [my personal history] because it allows me to debunk that myth about our history.\n\nAs for the relative recency of this: If my mother and father are still alive and they went through this, if Ruby Bridges is still alive and has an Instagram page , then it was not that long ago.\n\nWhen you put it that way, it sums it up so perfectly: Ruby Bridges has an Instagram page.\n\nExactly. That biographical engine acts as a throughline throughout the book that allows us to see, yes, how far we've come, but also that this isn't distant history, and it can repeat itself.\n\nYou delve quite a bit into the history of white missionaries using education to forcibly assimilate freed Black people during Reconstruction. Christian nationalism has played a major role in both Trump's campaign and his plans as president. Are there parallels between modern-day Christian nationalists and these missionaries?\n\nWe've got this amalgamation of multiple movements coming together right now, a movement of white evangelical Christian nationalists. We're seeing the religious and political infusion turn into a social movement. It's a well-organized machine that has a long game, that has a playbook, but they're not operating alone. How do these movements build power? There was a cartoon when I was growing up called [Voltron] , and when they all got together, they created a giant robot. That's what these movements do.\n\nYou've got the MAGA movement, but you've also got the technocratic billionaires' boys club combining with American institutions, the media, and the government, all working together to destabilize the school system and create a feedback loop of rhetoric. This works as a playbook that allows everybody to have a role in this whole system.\n\nWhy target our education system?\n\nIf you capture the school system, you're going to capture a whole generation of minds. You don't have to individually push your agenda. You don't have to go school by school. You just get the whole system.\n\n\"The Trump administration has tried to seduce Black Americans to fall into the trap and illusion of Black capitalism. But Republicans are one-trick ponies.\"\n\nOne thing you emphasize in the book is the outsized role that \"white money\" played in funding Black schools, as well as in the shaping of the curriculum at the time. Can you speak a little about that?\n\nThere is an old African American saying: All money ain't good money.\n\nAmerican Big Philanthropy as we know it today originated with education in the South. The two of the first philanthropic organizations that were endowed with over a million dollars in the US were the Peabody Education Fund and the Slater Fund . They both were founded to help establish a Southern education system. The Slater Fund, which was founded in 1882 right after the fall of Reconstruction, solely focused on Black schools. That money was greatly needed, because the Southern states were not going to fund Black schools. You also have the Rockefeller Foundation being born during this time, the Carnegie Corporation being born during this time, and many others. They're all interested in Black segregated schools.\n\nDo disadvantaged Black communities need funding to have equitable resources and education? Absolutely. However, it came with thick strings attached. The first demand that America's billionaires put on those schools was control of the curricula. If a school did not abide by this, you could say goodbye to that grant funding, and that would be the difference for many Black schools over whether they were going to be able to open their doors the next day or whether an entire community of Black children was going to be able to learn.\n\nThat is equivalent to Elon Musk getting on stage today and saying, \"You know, I really want to help Black communities, and I'm going to get together with Jeff Bezos and Peter Thiel, and we're going to set up educational programs in disadvantaged Black communities.\"\n\nTrump often tries to relate to Black audiences in bizarre ways, many of which use capitalism as a tool. For example, his comments about protecting \"Black jobs\" during last year's presidential debate, or inviting several Black rappers to this year's Black History Month reception, many of whom have claimed that Trump will make them richer.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this tactic and the Black conservative leaders who co-sign it?\n\nAs the revolutionary Fred Hampton said , we're not going to liberate ourselves or free ourselves from capitalism. The Trump administration has tried to seduce Black Americans to fall into the trap and illusion of Black capitalism.\n\nBut Republicans are one-trick ponies. They've only got the same four or five plays over and over again. Once you know what they are, then you can see them when they're trying to be used on you to dismantle or disrupt the strategy. What we saw with how Black capitalism was cultivated and used was an effort to try to capture the political imaginations of some African Americans in the post-emancipation, early 20th century.\n\nBlack capitalism in particular has often been used as a carrot by conservative movements to divide and conquer and create chaos within Black communities. They try to cultivate a Black minority group subset to accompany a majority-white conservative movement.\n\nThere are a lot of Black people in America who voted for Donald Trump for those very reasons: \"I might not agree with everything that he's saying, but no politician has done anything for me, and at least I can get rich under Donald Trump.\" This is rhetoric steeped in the logic of wealthing or classing your way out of racial violence, racial terror, authoritarianism, and fascism. In the case of conservative and billionaire boys club movements, they weaponize these tropes and tokenize people to parrot these tropes so that they can poison their own wells. And when they're done with them, they discard them.\n\nWhat happens to tokens? They get spent.\n\nLet's talk about Thomas Jesse Jones, a sociologist who W.E.B. Du Bois dubbed the \"the evil genius of the Negro race.\" In 1916, Jones released a pseudoscientific study arguing against the efficacy of Black-led higher education. That study then launched a disinformation campaign against historically Black schools, with critics treating Jones' bigotry as fact.\n\nTalk to me about the disinformation we see today and the relationship to Jones' efforts .\n\nThis book is the culmination of eight years of archival research. So I've been tracing this man in the archives for almost a decade of my life, and he is sneaky. It's important to note that he was a sociologist. [Jones' influence] is a testament to how powerful the social sciences are and the legitimacy that academics can lend to ideology.\n\nI believe that educators are superheroes, and Thomas Jesse Jones used his superpowers for evil, to sell his science to the highest bidder, toward the aims of ideology and pseudoscience that was meant to cause harm to a whole swath of the American population. A modern example that is analogous to what Jones was doing back then with his billionaire boys club would be PragerU , a conservative right-wing organization that is funded by billionaires from the fracking industry.\n\nPragerU puts out short, digestible conservative propaganda, educational clips that are made to teach parents and children about a \"non-woke curriculum.\" They're rewriting history, framing enslaved Black people as laborers, and softening the histories of disenfranchised, marginalized populations.\n\nIt's offering a script to white parents for how to spot \"wokeism\" and DEI in their child's curricula. Now, why do I point to PragerU when I talk about Thomas Jesse Jones? These are the same kinds of apparatuses of propagandized pseudoscience that are being marketed to a broader public. It's made to stoke latent dispositions of white rage, racism, and anti-Blackness.\n\nWhat are some ways that the average person can detect when they're being fed propaganda?\n\nThe digital age makes this difficult because of the onslaught of information that we are presented. I love TikTok, and I learn a lot from it. But we should not be taking sound bites, tweets, or hot takes without skepticism. It deteriorates our ability for critical thinking and destabilizes our ability to fact-check and do the work of being an informed person.\n\nSo from Thomas Jesse Jones, I learned how important it is to slow down. It's a slippery slope into being tricked into and propagandized into pipelines. If Thomas Jesse Jones were here today, I promise you, he would have a huge TikTok page. He'd be putting out a lot of videos. He'd be on Twitter.\n\nHow will this new political landscape affect Black people looking to become educators?\n\nLanguage is the grease that keeps the system of white supremacy going. One of the roles that this attack on DEI plays in the long game, in the larger strategy, is a fear tactic. Why do I describe it as a fear tactic? Because DEI is being uprooted from its original intention, from its institutionalized meaning and form, uprooted and politicized to mean nothing or any bogeyman that you want it to mean.\n\nWhen you hear conservatives saying, \"DEI must die,\" a lot of times, that just means Black people, places, or things. Sometimes that means anything that's not white, straight, Christian, or male. It can mean anything that the arbiter of that term wants it to mean, and they don't have the responsibility or accountability of defining what they're talking about. That stokes a lot of fear, because who's to know what is DEI and what's not?\n\nThey are threatening violence toward our teachers. They are stoking distrust among educators, intellectuals, and the institutions of higher education. That's very powerful. It does have teeth in this regime. But I want to make it clear: We saw this also in the past.\n\nOne of my favorite portions of the book is the epilogue, where you listed the 10 lessons that we should learn from our ancestors. In these times, I know that I often find myself fighting off feelings of hopelessness. Can you speak about the importance of remaining hopeful when it comes to fighting for Black liberation?\n\nI wrote the epilogue and the last chapter, \"Small Acts,\" the day after the election. I couldn't write the end of the book until I knew what the result was going to be, and I wanted to bring the emotional weight of whatever I was feeling, no matter what the outcome, to the end of the book.\n\nSo that's what you see and that's what you might feel in those last parts of the book. That was a very hard day for a lot of us, but I went back and read the whole rest of the book. I went back to all the other chapters and said, \"What are the lessons? What lessons did they leave us?\" And I didn't find any evidence of nihilism or despair.\n\nIt's CliffsNotes from Mary Smith Peake, who founded that school under an oak tree during the Civil War. Six million Americans are getting ripped to pieces all around you. Black people are still enslaved, and this war is going to decide whether your people are going to remain chattel or be humans under the law in the United States. And was she sitting there rolling around, crying, saying it's never gonna happen? No, she starts a school, teaching Black people who are escaping and being considered contraband how to read and write, telling them to get ready. Freedom is coming. We've got to be prepared.\n\nThe Battle for the Black Mind will be released May 13 and is available for preorder .

Last week, however, it became more than a figurative admonition when Lolade Siyanbola, a black graduate student at Yale University, was reported to campus police by a white female student for the suspicious action of napping in a dormitory common room. Like generations of hard-grinding Ivy League scholars, Siyanbola had succumbed to the exhaustion of finals week. But her inability to stay awake-a literal failure to stay woke-resulted in a 20-minute encounter with police officers who insisted she verify her right to be on campus. I first learned about the Yale incident when Prof. Sherri Williams of American University shared the news with the Black on Campus GroupMe chat. The GroupMe is one of the key tools that Dr. Williams and I use to communicate with a cohort of 10 student journalists. The Black on Campus fellows attend colleges and graduate schools throughout the country. Since January they have been meeting, studying, traveling, and writing together in a program jointly sponsored by the Anna Julia Cooper Center at Wake Forest University and The Nation as they document the lived experiences of today's black college students. This story was produced in partnership with the Anna Julia Cooper Center of Wake Forest University as part of Black on Campus, a series reporting on issues of national consequence to a black college student audience. It is under the umbrella of Student Nation, a section devoted to highlighting campus activism and student movements from students in their own words. For more Student Nation, check out our archive .  The Student Nation program is made possible through generous funding from The Puffin Foundation . The Black on Campus cohort barely reacted when Dr. Williams shared word of the Yale incident. They may have been outraged, but racial shock is exceedingly rare among these young reporters. After all, their academic year began with white supremacists wielding flaming tiki torches as they marched through the grounds of the University of Virginia chanting \"You will not replace us.\" On a near weekly basis, we've shared stories of campuses inflamed by symbolic racism , discursive violence , or bodily harm against black students in predominantly white spaces. We reeled when Howard University was caught in a funding scandal , suggesting that even the nation's premier historically black university was a place where students experienced intentional institutional harm. For Black on Campus fellows, these stories were not distant or disconnected. Fellow Lauren Lumpkin and Dr. Williams study and work at American University, where bananas and nooses were found hanging in trees one year ago. The wounds of white-supremacist violence are still fresh at the University of Virginia, where fellow Alexis Gravely is a junior. Wake Forest fellow Bri Reddick was trying to study for midterms when she found herself at the center of a campus racial controversy making national headlines.

Campus Awakening Today's black college students have spent their baccalaureate years navigating campus hate speech, dodging constantly changing DACA rulings, and living with the real consequences of repealing affirmative action and Title IX enforcement. The new class of college seniors started school in the fall of 2015. That semester, graduate student Jonathan Butler stopped eating to protest inaction and ineffective administrative responses to racial incidents at the University of Missouri. He refused to resume eating until the system's president, Tim Wolfe, resigned. Four days into his hunger strike, Butler was joined by 30 Missouri football players who announced they would boycott football activities until Wolfe resigned. Within weeks both the campus chancellor and Wolfe were gone, and the effects of the Mizzou protests were still being felt for years after they began. In 2017, The New York Times reported on plummeting enrollment and a budgetary crisis at the University of Missouri as students remained wary of a campus where racial clashes had reached such a fever pitch. It is impossible to determine the precise nature of the correlation-whether the protests effected these new campus realities-but there is no question that the events at Mizzou continue to resonate across the landscape of American higher education. Mizzou was a turning point. Within weeks, black students organized massive demonstrations on Ivy League campuses and flagship state universities. Activists decried the racial climate on campuses in the South, Northeast, Midwest, and California. They demanded change at schools small and large, on campuses with conservative or liberal reputations. Echoing tactics employed by student demonstrators in the 1960s and '70s, they held vigils and rallies and staged takeovers of administrative offices, articulating systemic, symbolic, and structural concerns about their experiences of being black on campus. Yale students resisted faculty who declared racially insensitive Halloween costumes to be protected speech. Princeton students demanded the removal of Woodrow Wilson's name from campus buildings in light of his troubling racial legacy. Harvard Law students discovered photos of black faculty members that had been defaced in the halls. Suddenly these experiences no longer seemed isolated, but were linked as part of a larger movement against institutional racism in higher education. Current Issue View our current issue Many stood in solidarity with the student protesters, but others were exasperated by their actions and in some cases implied that personal discomfort, or even interpersonal experiences of racism, were a steep but necessary price to pay for a college education . Even within black communities, there were intergenerational divides born from the painful disappointments of seeing college-long a kind of symbolic promised land-decried as yet another space of racial violence and rejection. It can seem inherently revolutionary to nurture black intellect in a country built on the surplus value extracted from nonconsensual physical and reproductive black labor. Viewing higher education as a pathway to equity, African-American families and communities have made enormous sacrifices to send black kids to college. It was painful to see that golden ring turn to brass. Substance of Things Hoped For In March 1960, Ebony magazine profiled \"Richmond's Genius Twins\" in a multipage spread about William and Wesley Harris, who were poised to graduate from segregated Armstrong High School and become the first in their family to attend college. Ebony described Wes and William as \"sons of a restaurant owner who died in 1955 and a Richmond seamstress who is a chronic arthritic and earns $35 a week doing home sewing and making slipcovers.\" Knowing her sons' departure for college would significantly reduce her household's already meager income, Rosa Harris told Ebony she was nonetheless determined that \"the boys will go to college!\" in spite of the difficult sacrifices it required. Black parents, grandmas, papas, aunties, congregations, Masonic lodges, sorority chapters, and fraternal orders have echoed the determination to ensure that the children in their communities make it to college to earn a coveted degree. A college education has always been a rare commodity. Prior to World War II, only a small fraction of white people attended college. It was not until the second half of the 20th century that the GI Bill and a changing domestic labor market made college a more common experience for white Americans. In 1960, only 10 percent of white men older than 25 had completed four years of college; by 1990, that share had grown to nearly one in four white men. Today, more than a third of white Americans over 25 have college degrees. For black folks, the barriers to college have been far higher and more aggressively guarded. In 1960, 2.8 percent of black men and 3.3 percent of black women over 25 had completed four-year college degrees. Today, one in five black Americans is a college graduate. For much of the 20th century, the vast majority of black students obtained degrees at Historically Black Colleges and Universities. HBCUs have proud legacies but have never boasted the robust resources of their predominantly white peers. It is worth remembering that George Wallace did not stand in the doorway of a primary school or high school. Rather, in 1963, he blocked the entrance to a state land-grant university as he sought to keep Vivian Malone and James Hood from entering the University of Alabama-thus ensuring, Wallace hoped, \"segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever.\" Is it any wonder, then, that black folk have developed a tradition of boisterous, thunderous, celebratory enthusiasm during college graduations? Each and every graduate marching, striding, shouting, and hopping across the stage as they accept the parchment so rarely passed into black hands is a repudiation of Governor Wallace. And is it any wonder why black people were appalled to witness the white graduation marshals at the University of Florida aggressively push, pull, and nearly tackle black graduates as they attempted to dance their way across the commencement stage this month? In a way, those marshals were reimposing the segregationist barrier; they saw neither the depth of the sacrifices that made these graduations possible nor the historical context in which they were achieved. No Evidence for the Things We Hoped to See The racial inequities in American higher-education outcomes are shocking. During the past 50 years, the gap between black and white high-school graduation rates has narrowed, but the racial gulf for attaining a bachelor's degree has widened-doubling from 6 to 13 percent since 1964. Higher education is not a great equalizer. The struggle, sacrifice, and effort it takes for black students to earn a degree often pays meager long-term economic dividends, while extracting enormous emotional costs. The median wealth return for college graduation for white families is $55,869, while black families enjoy a median return on college graduation of only $4,846. This results from the crushing debt carried by black graduates. Compared to their white peers, black students are more likely to borrow to pay for college, less likely make repayment progress within 12 years, and much more likely to default. Employment prospects improve for African Americans when they graduate from college, but a degree does not eliminate the racial inequities of the labor market. Compared to their white counterparts, black college graduates in their late 20s are nearly twice as likely to be unemployed. Even amid the economic recovery of 2016, black college graduates aged 24-29 experienced an unemployment rate of 9.4 percent -a rate higher than the 9 percent unemployment rate that young white college grads suffered at the peak of the recession. Colleges and universities are not ivory towers tucked away from the real world or able to avoid controversy at will. These institutions are embedded in our communities and in our consciousness. To be black on campus is to be black in America. But despite these depressing statistics, there is still something powerfully compelling about being black on campus. When global superstar Beyoncé chose to frame her earth-shattering 2018 Coachella performance with one aspect of black cultural life, she chose black college life. Though she did not attend college, Beyoncé offered up a citational riff on collegiate blackness, from HBCU drum majors and drum lines to black sororities and pledge lines. Despite its all too frequently amounting to four painful years, Beyoncé celebrated the experience of being black on campus. The Legacy William and Wes Harris, Ebony 's \" genius twins,\" both became college graduates. In fact, both became college professors. William finished at Howard University, earned a PhD at the University of Washington, then returned to the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, where he taught for more than 20 years and served as the first dean of African-American affairs. Wes made history as the first black man to earn an engineering PhD from Princeton and later chaired the Department of Aeronautical Engineering at MIT. His historic accomplishments began at UVA, where he was the first African-American student to live on the Lawn. Sending the twins to college required their mother to make enduring sacrifices, but Prof. Wes Harris remembers his experiences at UVA in the early 1960s being marked by racial exclusion, threats, and violence . Dr. Harris's story is not entirely dissimilar from the one recounted by Lauren Lumpkin, the Black on Campus fellow, last week when she served as the American University School of Communication undergraduate student speaker. Lauren's brief but affecting address began by acknowledging the parents and teachers whose efforts made her own success possible. She spoke of her teenage longing to attend American University and then of her broken heart when the campus was marred by ugly racial incidents. Lauren explained it was her awakening to the need for diverse voices telling diverse stories in the wake of these experiences that led her to the School of Communication and to her chosen career as a journalist. More than five decades separate the college careers of Wesley Harris and Lauren Lumpkin. Still, they are intertwined. Wes and William Harris are my uncle and father. Lauren is one of my students. Their stories matter. We must understand what it has meant, historically, and assess what it means now, to be black on campus. For the next several months The Nation will bring you reporting from the talented young writers of the Black on Campus cohort as they follow in the example of Ida B. Wells-righting wrongs by shining the light of truth upon them.

No Evidence for the Things We Hoped to See The racial inequities in American higher-education outcomes are shocking. During the past 50 years, the gap between black and white high-school graduation rates has narrowed, but the racial gulf for attaining a bachelor's degree has widened-doubling from 6 to 13 percent since 1964. Higher education is not a great equalizer. The struggle, sacrifice, and effort it takes for black students to earn a degree often pays meager long-term economic dividends, while extracting enormous emotional costs. The median wealth return for college graduation for white families is $55,869, while black families enjoy a median return on college graduation of only $4,846. This results from the crushing debt carried by black graduates. Compared to their white peers, black students are more likely to borrow to pay for college, less likely make repayment progress within 12 years, and much more likely to default. Employment prospects improve for African Americans when they graduate from college, but a degree does not eliminate the racial inequities of the labor market. Compared to their white counterparts, black college graduates in their late 20s are nearly twice as likely to be unemployed. Even amid the economic recovery of 2016, black college graduates aged 24-29 experienced an unemployment rate of 9.4 percent -a rate higher than the 9 percent unemployment rate that young white college grads suffered at the peak of the recession. Colleges and universities are not ivory towers tucked away from the real world or able to avoid controversy at will. These institutions are embedded in our communities and in our consciousness. To be black on campus is to be black in America. But despite these depressing statistics, there is still something powerfully compelling about being black on campus. When global superstar Beyoncé chose to frame her earth-shattering 2018 Coachella performance with one aspect of black cultural life, she chose black college life.

The Legacy William and Wes Harris, Ebony 's \" genius twins,\" both became college graduates. In fact, both became college professors. William finished at Howard University, earned a PhD at the University of Washington, then returned to the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, where he taught for more than 20 years and served as the first dean of African-American affairs. Wes made history as the first black man to earn an engineering PhD from Princeton and later chaired the Department of Aeronautical Engineering at MIT. His historic accomplishments began at UVA, where he was the first African-American student to live on the Lawn. Sending the twins to college required their mother to make enduring sacrifices, but Prof. Wes Harris remembers his experiences at UVA in the early 1960s being marked by racial exclusion, threats, and violence . Dr. Harris's story is not entirely dissimilar from the one recounted by Lauren Lumpkin, the Black on Campus fellow, last week when she served as the American University School of Communication undergraduate student speaker. Lauren's brief but affecting address began by acknowledging the parents and teachers whose efforts made her own success possible. She spoke of her teenage longing to attend American University and then of her broken heart when the campus was marred by ugly racial incidents. Lauren explained it was her awakening to the need for diverse voices telling diverse stories in the wake of these experiences that led her to the School of Communication and to her chosen career as a journalist. More than five decades separate the college careers of Wesley Harris and Lauren Lumpkin. Still, they are intertwined. Wes and William Harris are my uncle and father. Lauren is one of my students. Their stories matter. We must understand what it has meant, historically, and assess what it means now, to be black on campus.

Campus Awakening Today's black college students have spent their baccalaureate years navigating campus hate speech, dodging constantly changing DACA rulings, and living with the real consequences of repealing affirmative action and Title IX enforcement. The new class of college seniors started school in the fall of 2015. That semester, graduate student Jonathan Butler stopped eating to protest inaction and ineffective administrative responses to racial incidents at the University of Missouri. He refused to resume eating until the system's president, Tim Wolfe, resigned. Four days into his hunger strike, Butler was joined by 30 Missouri football players who announced they would boycott football activities until Wolfe resigned. Within weeks both the campus chancellor and Wolfe were gone, and the effects of the Mizzou protests were still being felt for years after they began. In 2017, The New York Times reported on plummeting enrollment and a budgetary crisis at the University of Missouri as students remained wary of a campus where racial clashes had reached such a fever pitch. It is impossible to determine the precise nature of the correlation-whether the protests effected these new campus realities-but there is no question that the events at Mizzou continue to resonate across the landscape of American higher education. Mizzou was a turning point. Within weeks, black students organized massive demonstrations on Ivy League campuses and flagship state universities. Activists decried the racial climate on campuses in the South, Northeast, Midwest, and California. They demanded change at schools small and large, on campuses with conservative or liberal reputations. Echoing tactics employed by student demonstrators in the 1960s and '70s, they held vigils and rallies and staged takeovers of administrative offices, articulating systemic, symbolic, and structural concerns about their experiences of being black on campus. Yale students resisted faculty who declared racially insensitive Halloween costumes to be protected speech. Princeton students demanded the removal of Woodrow Wilson's name from campus buildings in light of his troubling racial legacy. Harvard Law students discovered photos of black faculty members that had been defaced in the halls. Suddenly these experiences no longer seemed isolated, but were linked as part of a larger movement against institutional racism in higher education. Current Issue View our current issue Many stood in solidarity with the student protesters, but others were exasperated by their actions and in some cases implied that personal discomfort, or even interpersonal experiences of racism, were a steep but necessary price to pay for a college education . Even within black communities, there were intergenerational divides born from the painful disappointments of seeing college-long a kind of symbolic promised land-decried as yet another space of racial violence and rejection. It can seem inherently revolutionary to nurture black intellect in a country built on the surplus value extracted from nonconsensual physical and reproductive black labor. Viewing higher education as a pathway to equity, African-American families and communities have made enormous sacrifices to send black kids to college. It was painful to see that golden ring turn to brass. Substance of Things Hoped For In March 1960, Ebony magazine profiled \"Richmond's Genius Twins\" in a multipage spread about William and Wesley Harris, who were poised to graduate from segregated Armstrong High School and become the first in their family to attend college. Ebony described Wes and William as \"sons of a restaurant owner who died in 1955 and a Richmond seamstress who is a chronic arthritic and earns $35 a week doing home sewing and making slipcovers.\" Knowing her sons' departure for college would significantly reduce her household's already meager income, Rosa Harris told Ebony she was nonetheless determined that \"the boys will go to college!\" in spite of the difficult sacrifices it required. Black parents, grandmas, papas, aunties, congregations, Masonic lodges, sorority chapters, and fraternal orders have echoed the determination to ensure that the children in their communities make it to college to earn a coveted degree. A college education has always been a rare commodity. Prior to World War II, only a small fraction of white people attended college. It was not until the second half of the 20th century that the GI Bill and a changing domestic labor market made college a more common experience for white Americans. In 1960, only 10 percent of white men older than 25 had completed four years of college; by 1990, that share had grown to nearly one in four white men. Today, more than a third of white Americans over 25 have college degrees. For black folks, the barriers to college have been far higher and more aggressively guarded. In 1960, 2.8 percent of black men and 3.3 percent of black women over 25 had completed four-year college degrees. Today, one in five black Americans is a college graduate. For much of the 20th century, the vast majority of black students obtained degrees at Historically Black Colleges and Universities. HBCUs have proud legacies but have never boasted the robust resources of their predominantly white peers. It is worth remembering that George Wallace did not stand in the doorway of a primary school or high school. Rather, in 1963, he blocked the entrance to a state land-grant university as he sought to keep Vivian Malone and James Hood from entering the University of Alabama-thus ensuring, Wallace hoped, \"segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever.\" Is it any wonder, then, that black folk have developed a tradition of boisterous, thunderous, celebratory enthusiasm during college graduations? Each and every graduate marching, striding, shouting, and hopping across the stage as they accept the parchment so rarely passed into black hands is a repudiation of Governor Wallace.

William finished at Howard University, earned a PhD at the University of Washington, then returned to the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, where he taught for more than 20 years and served as the first dean of African-American affairs. Wes made history as the first black man to earn an engineering PhD from Princeton and later chaired the Department of Aeronautical Engineering at MIT. His historic accomplishments began at UVA, where he was the first African-American student to live on the Lawn. Sending the twins to college required their mother to make enduring sacrifices, but Prof. Wes Harris remembers his experiences at UVA in the early 1960s being marked by racial exclusion, threats, and violence . Dr. Harris's story is not entirely dissimilar from the one recounted by Lauren Lumpkin, the Black on Campus fellow, last week when she served as the American University School of Communication undergraduate student speaker. Lauren's brief but affecting address began by acknowledging the parents and teachers whose efforts made her own success possible. She spoke of her teenage longing to attend American University and then of her broken heart when the campus was marred by ugly racial incidents. Lauren explained it was her awakening to the need for diverse voices telling diverse stories in the wake of these experiences that led her to the School of Communication and to her chosen career as a journalist. More than five decades separate the college careers of Wesley Harris and Lauren Lumpkin. Still, they are intertwined. Wes and William Harris are my uncle and father. Lauren is one of my students. Their stories matter. We must understand what it has meant, historically, and assess what it means now, to be black on campus.

Within weeks, black students organized massive demonstrations on Ivy League campuses and flagship state universities. Activists decried the racial climate on campuses in the South, Northeast, Midwest, and California. They demanded change at schools small and large, on campuses with conservative or liberal reputations. Echoing tactics employed by student demonstrators in the 1960s and '70s, they held vigils and rallies and staged takeovers of administrative offices, articulating systemic, symbolic, and structural concerns about their experiences of being black on campus. Yale students resisted faculty who declared racially insensitive Halloween costumes to be protected speech. Princeton students demanded the removal of Woodrow Wilson's name from campus buildings in light of his troubling racial legacy. Harvard Law students discovered photos of black faculty members that had been defaced in the halls. Suddenly these experiences no longer seemed isolated, but were linked as part of a larger movement against institutional racism in higher education. Current Issue View our current issue Many stood in solidarity with the student protesters, but others were exasperated by their actions and in some cases implied that personal discomfort, or even interpersonal experiences of racism, were a steep but necessary price to pay for a college education . Even within black communities, there were intergenerational divides born from the painful disappointments of seeing college-long a kind of symbolic promised land-decried as yet another space of racial violence and rejection. It can seem inherently revolutionary to nurture black intellect in a country built on the surplus value extracted from nonconsensual physical and reproductive black labor. Viewing higher education as a pathway to equity, African-American families and communities have made enormous sacrifices to send black kids to college. It was painful to see that golden ring turn to brass. Substance of Things Hoped For In March 1960, Ebony magazine profiled \"Richmond's Genius Twins\" in a multipage spread about William and Wesley Harris, who were poised to graduate from segregated Armstrong High School and become the first in their family to attend college. Ebony described Wes and William as \"sons of a restaurant owner who died in 1955 and a Richmond seamstress who is a chronic arthritic and earns $35 a week doing home sewing and making slipcovers.\" Knowing her sons' departure for college would significantly reduce her household's already meager income, Rosa Harris told Ebony she was nonetheless determined that \"the boys will go to college!\" in spite of the difficult sacrifices it required. Black parents, grandmas, papas, aunties, congregations, Masonic lodges, sorority chapters, and fraternal orders have echoed the determination to ensure that the children in their communities make it to college to earn a coveted degree. A college education has always been a rare commodity. Prior to World War II, only a small fraction of white people attended college. It was not until the second half of the 20th century that the GI Bill and a changing domestic labor market made college a more common experience for white Americans. In 1960, only 10 percent of white men older than 25 had completed four years of college; by 1990, that share had grown to nearly one in four white men. Today, more than a third of white Americans over 25 have college degrees. For black folks, the barriers to college have been far higher and more aggressively guarded. In 1960, 2.8 percent of black men and 3.3 percent of black women over 25 had completed four-year college degrees. Today, one in five black Americans is a college graduate. For much of the 20th century, the vast majority of black students obtained degrees at Historically Black Colleges and Universities. HBCUs have proud legacies but have never boasted the robust resources of their predominantly white peers. It is worth remembering that George Wallace did not stand in the doorway of a primary school or high school. Rather, in 1963, he blocked the entrance to a state land-grant university as he sought to keep Vivian Malone and James Hood from entering the University of Alabama-thus ensuring, Wallace hoped, \"segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever.\" Is it any wonder, then, that black folk have developed a tradition of boisterous, thunderous, celebratory enthusiasm during college graduations? Each and every graduate marching, striding, shouting, and hopping across the stage as they accept the parchment so rarely passed into black hands is a repudiation of Governor Wallace. And is it any wonder why black people were appalled to witness the white graduation marshals at the University of Florida aggressively push, pull, and nearly tackle black graduates as they attempted to dance their way across the commencement stage this month? In a way, those marshals were reimposing the segregationist barrier; they saw neither the depth of the sacrifices that made these graduations possible nor the historical context in which they were achieved. No Evidence for the Things We Hoped to See The racial inequities in American higher-education outcomes are shocking. During the past 50 years, the gap between black and white high-school graduation rates has narrowed, but the racial gulf for attaining a bachelor's degree has widened-doubling from 6 to 13 percent since 1964. Higher education is not a great equalizer. The struggle, sacrifice, and effort it takes for black students to earn a degree often pays meager long-term economic dividends, while extracting enormous emotional costs. The median wealth return for college graduation for white families is $55,869, while black families enjoy a median return on college graduation of only $4,846. This results from the crushing debt carried by black graduates.

In 1960, 2.8 percent of black men and 3.3 percent of black women over 25 had completed four-year college degrees. Today, one in five black Americans is a college graduate. For much of the 20th century, the vast majority of black students obtained degrees at Historically Black Colleges and Universities. HBCUs have proud legacies but have never boasted the robust resources of their predominantly white peers. It is worth remembering that George Wallace did not stand in the doorway of a primary school or high school. Rather, in 1963, he blocked the entrance to a state land-grant university as he sought to keep Vivian Malone and James Hood from entering the University of Alabama-thus ensuring, Wallace hoped, \"segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever.\" Is it any wonder, then, that black folk have developed a tradition of boisterous, thunderous, celebratory enthusiasm during college graduations? Each and every graduate marching, striding, shouting, and hopping across the stage as they accept the parchment so rarely passed into black hands is a repudiation of Governor Wallace. And is it any wonder why black people were appalled to witness the white graduation marshals at the University of Florida aggressively push, pull, and nearly tackle black graduates as they attempted to dance their way across the commencement stage this month? In a way, those marshals were reimposing the segregationist barrier; they saw neither the depth of the sacrifices that made these graduations possible nor the historical context in which they were achieved. No Evidence for the Things We Hoped to See The racial inequities in American higher-education outcomes are shocking. During the past 50 years, the gap between black and white high-school graduation rates has narrowed, but the racial gulf for attaining a bachelor's degree has widened-doubling from 6 to 13 percent since 1964. Higher education is not a great equalizer. The struggle, sacrifice, and effort it takes for black students to earn a degree often pays meager long-term economic dividends, while extracting enormous emotional costs. The median wealth return for college graduation for white families is $55,869, while black families enjoy a median return on college graduation of only $4,846. This results from the crushing debt carried by black graduates. Compared to their white peers, black students are more likely to borrow to pay for college, less likely make repayment progress within 12 years, and much more likely to default. Employment prospects improve for African Americans when they graduate from college, but a degree does not eliminate the racial inequities of the labor market. Compared to their white counterparts, black college graduates in their late 20s are nearly twice as likely to be unemployed. Even amid the economic recovery of 2016, black college graduates aged 24-29 experienced an unemployment rate of 9.4 percent -a rate higher than the 9 percent unemployment rate that young white college grads suffered at the peak of the recession. Colleges and universities are not ivory towers tucked away from the real world or able to avoid controversy at will. These institutions are embedded in our communities and in our consciousness. To be black on campus is to be black in America. But despite these depressing statistics, there is still something powerfully compelling about being black on campus. When global superstar Beyoncé chose to frame her earth-shattering 2018 Coachella performance with one aspect of black cultural life, she chose black college life. Though she did not attend college, Beyoncé offered up a citational riff on collegiate blackness, from HBCU drum majors and drum lines to black sororities and pledge lines. Despite its all too frequently amounting to four painful years, Beyoncé celebrated the experience of being black on campus. The Legacy William and Wes Harris, Ebony 's \" genius twins,\" both became college graduates. In fact, both became college professors. William finished at Howard University, earned a PhD at the University of Washington, then returned to the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, where he taught for more than 20 years and served as the first dean of African-American affairs. Wes made history as the first black man to earn an engineering PhD from Princeton and later chaired the Department of Aeronautical Engineering at MIT. His historic accomplishments began at UVA, where he was the first African-American student to live on the Lawn. Sending the twins to college required their mother to make enduring sacrifices, but Prof. Wes Harris remembers his experiences at UVA in the early 1960s being marked by racial exclusion, threats, and violence . Dr. Harris's story is not entirely dissimilar from the one recounted by Lauren Lumpkin, the Black on Campus fellow, last week when she served as the American University School of Communication undergraduate student speaker. Lauren's brief but affecting address began by acknowledging the parents and teachers whose efforts made her own success possible. She spoke of her teenage longing to attend American University and then of her broken heart when the campus was marred by ugly racial incidents. Lauren explained it was her awakening to the need for diverse voices telling diverse stories in the wake of these experiences that led her to the School of Communication and to her chosen career as a journalist. More than five decades separate the college careers of Wesley Harris and Lauren Lumpkin. Still, they are intertwined. Wes and William Harris are my uncle and father. Lauren is one of my students.

When global superstar Beyoncé chose to frame her earth-shattering 2018 Coachella performance with one aspect of black cultural life, she chose black college life. Though she did not attend college, Beyoncé offered up a citational riff on collegiate blackness, from HBCU drum majors and drum lines to black sororities and pledge lines. Despite its all too frequently amounting to four painful years, Beyoncé celebrated the experience of being black on campus. The Legacy William and Wes Harris, Ebony 's \" genius twins,\" both became college graduates. In fact, both became college professors. William finished at Howard University, earned a PhD at the University of Washington, then returned to the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, where he taught for more than 20 years and served as the first dean of African-American affairs. Wes made history as the first black man to earn an engineering PhD from Princeton and later chaired the Department of Aeronautical Engineering at MIT. His historic accomplishments began at UVA, where he was the first African-American student to live on the Lawn. Sending the twins to college required their mother to make enduring sacrifices, but Prof. Wes Harris remembers his experiences at UVA in the early 1960s being marked by racial exclusion, threats, and violence . Dr. Harris's story is not entirely dissimilar from the one recounted by Lauren Lumpkin, the Black on Campus fellow, last week when she served as the American University School of Communication undergraduate student speaker. Lauren's brief but affecting address began by acknowledging the parents and teachers whose efforts made her own success possible. She spoke of her teenage longing to attend American University and then of her broken heart when the campus was marred by ugly racial incidents. Lauren explained it was her awakening to the need for diverse voices telling diverse stories in the wake of these experiences that led her to the School of Communication and to her chosen career as a journalist. More than five decades separate the college careers of Wesley Harris and Lauren Lumpkin. Still, they are intertwined. Wes and William Harris are my uncle and father. Lauren is one of my students. Their stories matter. We must understand what it has meant, historically, and assess what it means now, to be black on campus. For the next several months The Nation will bring you reporting from the talented young writers of the Black on Campus cohort as they follow in the example of Ida B. Wells-righting wrongs by shining the light of truth upon them.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

The average student loan debt of black Americans is $7,400 more than their peers-and that amount can triple years after graduation.

In 2002, I couldn't wait to start college, and student loans-as well as work-study and the Federal Pell Grant-were part of the deal. I was elated to have a sense of independence and newfound freedom: a signal that I would be achieving an American dream. And while the dollar amount might appear excessive, it is by no means an anomaly for black Americans like me. During my four years at a small liberal arts college in the Pacific Northwest, I borrowed a total of $16,000. This debt was minor compared to what I accrued when I began my master's degree in 2008. When I was offered a financial aid package for my public health studies, it totaled $70,000, to be distributed over the course of two years. A decade later, my signature on that dotted line still plagues me. The student loan debt of black Americans is $7,400 more than that of our white peers, and that amount can triple years after graduation-mostly because of accrued interest , but also as the result of pervasive inequalities that increase throughout one's life. Women are particularly burdened by college debt: They hold nearly two-thirds of America's $1.46 trillion in student loans. So, unsurprisingly, are people of color. In \" Deeper in Debt ,\" the American Association of University Women found that black women have the most outstanding debt compared to white men and white women, with black women racking up $29,501 in undergraduate loans by graduation, compared to $20,210 for white women. The pay gap between black women and other groups worsens their ability to pay off the debt. In many cases, African Americans make little to no progress on paying off their student loans. In a 2016 Consumer Reports video, a graduate named Jessie Suren remarked, \"Debt is the first thing I factor in all of my decisions.\" Suren's personal account dovetailed with Ryann Liebenthal 's portrait of student loan survivors in Mother Jones . What Liebenthal highlights is the evolving privatization and mismanagement of student-loan management groups. The result: People were debilitated by their debt, taking 21 years on average to pay off their loans. And because black women make 61 cents for every dollar compared to their white male counterparts, it takes them longer to pay off the same amount of debt.

With a median net worth of $16,600 (compared to a net worth of $162,000 for their white counterparts) and $6,172 in credit card debt , the financial odds are stacked against black American families. Single black women aged 36-49, on average, have a net worth of $5 , while single white women in the same age group have a net worth of nearly $42,000. The statistic is calculated from median income, assets , and accumulated debt-that is, money owed from credit cards to student loans. A 2016 US Federal Reserve study found that 19 percent of black households have zero or negative net worth. Beyond that, women of color are discriminated against initially during hiring practices , so their starting income tends to be lower than their white counterparts'. These material realities bleed into other aspects of life. Current Issue View our current issue T he scale of indebtedness seems to climb daily, but it's far from a new phenomenon: The roots of the problem can be traced to 1619, the year the first enslaved Africans touched the English colony of Virginia . Debt was a crucial consequence of slavery: The profits from the transatlantic slave trade, as Eric Williams argues in his seminal text Capitalism & Slavery , allowed Europe and the United States to accumulate wealth, while slaves and their descendants were denied the fruits of their labor. This siphoning of wealth from black labor is part of how my family's debt began: My ancestors were forcibly brought to Saint Domingue (present-day Haiti), leaving them dispossessed from the wealth they earned for the French state, and in the case of Haiti, the newly independent black republic agreed to pay France $21 billion in 1825 to maintain its freedom . Slavery and its aftermath continue to hurt black Americans through housing segregation, adding to the debt they accumulate simply to stay alive. The 2019 US County Health Rankings shows that nearly a quarter of black families (compared to about one in 10 white families) spend more than half of their income on housing. The unevenness in housing-related costs means that black Americans paying off debt can save even less. What is more egregious is that usurious or excessive interest rates can turn a $1,000 loan into being $40,000 in the red. This undue burden trickles down to declining health and food insecurity , especially among children. Theses realities and centuries of broken promises helped sparked a national conversation for why housing inequality can contribute to a case for reparations . When the working class is drowning in loans, their bodies absorb the pain, which reverberates whenever one has to make a decision between paying rent or a phone bill. This is well-documented; in a 2018 study, researchers found that young Americans with student loan and credit card debt were (perhaps unsurprisingly) more likely to be psychologically distressed. In another study, researchers found that household debt contributed to higher blood pressure and obesity . Concomitant with these health outcomes are more severe mental health consequences, including suicidal ideation. Beyond that, debt causes the indebted person to be an automaton, perennially working to pay off the usury. And yet not all debt is debilitating; that, too, is a function of race and class. For the upper class, debt generates wealth. The borrowed wealth of the rich and famous is unashamedly displayed with their yachts and multiple homes around the world; the 45th US president is estimated to have a personal debt of at least $315 million . What this demonstrates is that the debt of the elite-whether they pay it back in a timely fashion or not-is not stigmatized, because they can exploit a system designed for them. Over the past decade, the government has responded to the student loan crisis. The US Department of Education's Income Based Repayment Expansion -which allowed payments to be capped at 10 percent of a person's discretionary income-was one remedy. Popularly known as Revised Pay as You Earn, or REPAYE, the program is meant to help 5 million newly eligible borrowers with their student loans. Another option is to live abroad. As a resident in Germany making less than 100,000 euros, my income-based repayment for Navient (formerly Sallie Mae) and Great Lakes Education is $0. Expatriating has provided me with more financial relief from my student loan than if I were to live in the United States. I am, in other words, a debt exile. What do we need to end black debt? An honest discussion about reparations-and forgiveness on a mass scale. At a moment when ordinary Americans of various socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds struggle to pay back student loans, mortgages, and health bills, eliminating debt needs to be central to US domestic policy if the next generation is to thrive. What the protests in Chile, Ecuador, Haiti, and Lebanon have shown is that individual and collective debt requires people to put their bodies on the line. It's only a matter of time until Americans realize that there's a vise around their neck as well-and that protesting to demand change is the only way to break free.\n\nDuring my four years at a small liberal arts college in the Pacific Northwest, I borrowed a total of $16,000.

What this demonstrates is that the debt of the elite-whether they pay it back in a timely fashion or not-is not stigmatized, because they can exploit a system designed for them. Over the past decade, the government has responded to the student loan crisis. The US Department of Education's Income Based Repayment Expansion -which allowed payments to be capped at 10 percent of a person's discretionary income-was one remedy. Popularly known as Revised Pay as You Earn, or REPAYE, the program is meant to help 5 million newly eligible borrowers with their student loans. Another option is to live abroad. As a resident in Germany making less than 100,000 euros, my income-based repayment for Navient (formerly Sallie Mae) and Great Lakes Education is $0. Expatriating has provided me with more financial relief from my student loan than if I were to live in the United States. I am, in other words, a debt exile. What do we need to end black debt? An honest discussion about reparations-and forgiveness on a mass scale. At a moment when ordinary Americans of various socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds struggle to pay back student loans, mortgages, and health bills, eliminating debt needs to be central to US domestic policy if the next generation is to thrive. What the protests in Chile, Ecuador, Haiti, and Lebanon have shown is that individual and collective debt requires people to put their bodies on the line. It's only a matter of time until Americans realize that there's a vise around their neck as well-and that protesting to demand change is the only way to break free.\n\nA decade later, my signature on that dotted line still plagues me. The student loan debt of black Americans is $7,400 more than that of our white peers, and that amount can triple years after graduation-mostly because of accrued interest , but also as the result of pervasive inequalities that increase throughout one's life. Women are particularly burdened by college debt: They hold nearly two-thirds of America's $1.46 trillion in student loans. So, unsurprisingly, are people of color. In \" Deeper in Debt ,\" the American Association of University Women found that black women have the most outstanding debt compared to white men and white women, with black women racking up $29,501 in undergraduate loans by graduation, compared to $20,210 for white women. The pay gap between black women and other groups worsens their ability to pay off the debt. In many cases, African Americans make little to no progress on paying off their student loans. In a 2016 Consumer Reports video, a graduate named Jessie Suren remarked, \"Debt is the first thing I factor in all of my decisions.\" Suren's personal account dovetailed with Ryann Liebenthal 's portrait of student loan survivors in Mother Jones . What Liebenthal highlights is the evolving privatization and mismanagement of student-loan management groups. The result: People were debilitated by their debt, taking 21 years on average to pay off their loans. And because black women make 61 cents for every dollar compared to their white male counterparts, it takes them longer to pay off the same amount of debt.

The 2019 US County Health Rankings shows that nearly a quarter of black families (compared to about one in 10 white families) spend more than half of their income on housing. The unevenness in housing-related costs means that black Americans paying off debt can save even less. What is more egregious is that usurious or excessive interest rates can turn a $1,000 loan into being $40,000 in the red. This undue burden trickles down to declining health and food insecurity , especially among children. Theses realities and centuries of broken promises helped sparked a national conversation for why housing inequality can contribute to a case for reparations . When the working class is drowning in loans, their bodies absorb the pain, which reverberates whenever one has to make a decision between paying rent or a phone bill. This is well-documented; in a 2018 study, researchers found that young Americans with student loan and credit card debt were (perhaps unsurprisingly) more likely to be psychologically distressed. In another study, researchers found that household debt contributed to higher blood pressure and obesity . Concomitant with these health outcomes are more severe mental health consequences, including suicidal ideation. Beyond that, debt causes the indebted person to be an automaton, perennially working to pay off the usury. And yet not all debt is debilitating; that, too, is a function of race and class. For the upper class, debt generates wealth. The borrowed wealth of the rich and famous is unashamedly displayed with their yachts and multiple homes around the world; the 45th US president is estimated to have a personal debt of at least $315 million . What this demonstrates is that the debt of the elite-whether they pay it back in a timely fashion or not-is not stigmatized, because they can exploit a system designed for them. Over the past decade, the government has responded to the student loan crisis. The US Department of Education's Income Based Repayment Expansion -which allowed payments to be capped at 10 percent of a person's discretionary income-was one remedy. Popularly known as Revised Pay as You Earn, or REPAYE, the program is meant to help 5 million newly eligible borrowers with their student loans. Another option is to live abroad. As a resident in Germany making less than 100,000 euros, my income-based repayment for Navient (formerly Sallie Mae) and Great Lakes Education is $0.

(Paul Hennessy / NurPhoto / Getty)\n\nBlack votes in this country are worth less than white votes. Joe Biden won the Electoral College because Black voters in Atlanta, Detroit, Milwaukee, and Philadelphia turned out in significant numbers. But even with overwhelming Black support- 94 percent of Detroit voted for Biden! -the outcomes in Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania were worryingly close. 1 The Argument is a column where writers and thinkers propose a provocative idea that may not be politically realizable in the short term but that pushes one to think broader about a pressing issue of public importance. One core problem is the Electoral College. Wyoming, which has just 580,000 residents and is 93 percent white, gets three electors because of its two senators and one representative in the House. By comparison, Georgia's Fifth Congressional District-which includes Atlanta, has 710,000 residents, and is 58 percent Black-has no dedicated electors or senators and can only occasionally overcome the mostly white and conservative votes from elsewhere in the state. This devaluation of Black votes allows our political system to ignore Black lives, and the consequences are devastating. Unequal representation has led to unequal health care outcomes, which the Covid-19 pandemic has only worsened . Without sufficient voting power, Black communities receive substandard education , and politicians are free to appoint judges who sanction mass incarceration , abusive policing , and electoral disenfranchisement . 2 This is all by design. The Constitution's framers set up the Electoral College to protect the interests of slave states . Along with the Senate, the Electoral College was critical in the endurance of slavery and its continuation by other means. Abolishing this system would mean that ballots cast by Black voters-or any voters, for that matter-would count the same. 3 But there's another way to undo the damage of the Electoral College and other structurally racist political institutions: We can implement vote reparations by double-counting ballots cast by all Black residents. The poisonous legacy of slavery applies to Black people regardless of when we or our ancestors arrived in this country. Vote reparations should also extend to Native Americans. Slavery is rightly called America's original sin, but so too was the United States' genocidal seizure of land from its original inhabitants. Various legal forms of disenfranchisement have applied to them. It wasn't until 1962 that all Native Americans were allowed to vote, and even then they faced-and still face-electoral obstacles. These are not the only examples of American oppression; we should include in vote reparations others who have suffered similar disenfranchisement. 4 Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The Impossibly Intertwined History of the Americas The Impossibly Intertwined History of the Americas Books & the Arts / Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The Impossibly Intertwined History of the Americas The Impossibly Intertwined History of the Americas Books & the Arts / Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins The Argument Cancel the Presidential Debates-Permanently Ed Burmila One of the largest objections to monetary reparations is the impracticality of implementing them on a scale that would meaningfully address the injustices. Vote reparations, in contrast, would be a simple, low-cost way to begin to make amends. 5 This idea isn't entirely new. Theodore Johnson, a senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, discussed a similar proposal in 2015 in The Washington Post . While his plan to make Black Americans' votes worth five-thirds has a poetic symmetry with the three-fifths clause of the Constitution, we shouldn't bind a remedy to the mathematics of the compromise that formalized and furthered the dehumanization of Black people. That bargain allowed the very people who stripped us of our rights to have their votes counted for more-even more than other white people-in Congress and the Electoral College. But it's not the only way politicians have legally denied representation to Black people. This country's history of poll taxes, literacy tests, gerrymandering, voter purges, and intimidation should all be addressed. Tying a remedy to the three-fifths compromise implies that clause was the heart of the problem. It wasn't and isn't. Counting Black votes twice keeps the point clear and provides redress for myriad forms of disenfranchisement deployed against Black voters. 6 Vote reparations would create possibilities to build what W.E.B. Du Bois called \"abolition democracy,\" or the practice of achieving a racially just society. Abolition democracy invites us to engage with abolition not as a finite goal but as a radical process of challenging injustices wherever and in whatever form they might appear. Vote reparations would empower us to replace oppressive institutions with life-affirming structures of economic, social, and political equality. And if our elected representatives did not prioritize this transformational work, we could vote them out. 7 Because white votes currently count more than Black ones, double-counting Black votes would restore electoral balance. Vote reparations would be a giant step toward remedying our nation's long history of denying and devaluing Black votes. To address systemic racism, we must transform how we choose our government. Even if vote reparations aren't instituted, Black voters will keep tirelessly dragging our states toward a more perfect union. But just imagine our country if our votes counted twice. 8\n\nThe Argument is a column where writers and thinkers propose a provocative idea that may not be politically realizable in the short term but that pushes one to think broader about a pressing issue of public importance.\n\nOne core problem is the Electoral College.

Vote reparations, in contrast, would be a simple, low-cost way to begin to make amends. 5 This idea isn't entirely new. Theodore Johnson, a senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, discussed a similar proposal in 2015 in The Washington Post . While his plan to make Black Americans' votes worth five-thirds has a poetic symmetry with the three-fifths clause of the Constitution, we shouldn't bind a remedy to the mathematics of the compromise that formalized and furthered the dehumanization of Black people. That bargain allowed the very people who stripped us of our rights to have their votes counted for more-even more than other white people-in Congress and the Electoral College. But it's not the only way politicians have legally denied representation to Black people. This country's history of poll taxes, literacy tests, gerrymandering, voter purges, and intimidation should all be addressed. Tying a remedy to the three-fifths compromise implies that clause was the heart of the problem. It wasn't and isn't.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

(AP Photo / File)\n\n\" T he third verse of the national anthem is not very well known in the United States,\" Jeffery Robinson, deputy legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), tells me, exasperated, over the phone. \"Here's how it ends: 'No refuge could save the hireling and slave / From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave. / And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave / O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.'\" \"That is our 'Star-Spangled Banner,'\" he says, pausing to let the words sink in. Then he explains: \"The Colonial Marines, a group of black slaves who fought with the British during the war of 1812 [for their freedom], were part of the troop that drove the Americans back into Washington, DC, and set the White House on fire. And four weeks later, Francis Scott Key is in Baltimore and he writes this national anthem-and he is celebrating the murder of slaves.\" Robinson, a veteran criminal-defense lawyer and self-avowed student of an untold American history, pulls it all together. \"When people have a debate today over 'respect' for the anthem, I think it's interesting to pull the covers away and take a closer look at what's really there.\" Robinson, who joined the ACLU two and a half years ago, has been touring the country with a talk filled with these kinds of bracing revelations. It's called \" Who We Are ,\" and it traces the history of racial oppression in the United States of America. In 2011, after a death in the family, his wife's nephew was sent from New York City to live with them in Seattle. \"A lot of the [racial-justice] issues that had been critically important to me took on a new tone, because I now had a young black man in my home,\" he says. His nephew, who wanted to \"do things like other kids,\" to hang out with friend and go out at night, brought with it anxiety for Robinson. \"I started having real concern about what was going to or could happen to him.\" The result of his worry became a long study into our nation's violent racist history. There is power in knowing this history, Robinson believes, a power that will help us on the path to a more equitable society. He hopes that the talks he's given-which will culminate in New York City on June 19 in an event featuring performances by Alfre Woodard, Amy Ryan, and the Resistance Revival Chorus-will open the door to a much more expansive project around reckoning with our past. The following interview has been condensed for length and clarity. The Nation : Your event in New York City is happening on Juneteenth. What's the significance there? Juneteenth is the earliest recognized celebration of enslaved people being freed, June 19. It's a day that's been traditionally celebrated in the black community in America, and we thought it was appropriate to have that event on that day because the history of that day is so critically important to understanding how and why we got to where are in June 2018.

Something I've been thinking about a lot recently is what many of us in media do with the deluge of information we're getting. That is, when it comes to covering issues surrounding racial justice or criminal justice, a lot of the time the work being done is more about triage. I think you're absolutely right, and it's one of the reasons I've started where I have. Because the triage is like a whack-a-mole. \"There's a problem here and I'll hit it!\" and \"There's a problem there and I'll hit it!\" And you will continue to spin around hitting these problems. This has been the experience of America on race relations since the end of the Civil War. You may remember Hillary Clinton telling Black Lives Matter activists, \"You don't change hearts and minds, you change policies and procedure.\" Anything that is given to you in a policy and a procedure can be taken away in a policy or procedure. And we've seen that with the current administration revoking executive order after executive order. So that is not the answer. The triage we see, in my view, is a result of us never having had a reckoning with our true history. If you say America was founded on the concept of white supremacy, people will say that is an exaggeration, that it's a political statement. My response is: Let's go to the history books. Let's just look at what the people who founded this country said and did, because they weren't embarrassed about it. And that unknown history runs from 1619 all the way through to today. We've been treating this problem like it's a headache, and you can take aspirin and cure a headache, but if you're taking aspirin when you really have is brain cancer, it's not gonna work. We have been taking aspirin instead of chemotherapy for our problems with race for decades and decades, if not centuries. The only way we will move forward is if we have a very clear understanding of what the true history of race and racial oppression is in America. I believe that will make people take a different look into where we are now and where we need to go into the future. I feel like under the Obama administration we were able to delve into some of the issues and history that you are doing. But now, we can't. Do you ever feel a tension about doing this work as opposed to focusing on the triage work? No. Because I have 34 years of representing individuals who were being crushed by the criminal-justice system, one at a time. That is triage as deep as you can get. And I love that work. But for me [doing this new work] was the opposite [of a tension]. I was trying to do a reset, if you will. \"The only way we will move forward is if we have a very clear understanding of what the true history of race and racial oppression is in America.\" This is just as important. Think about President Trump saying Andrew Jackson was really upset by what he saw in the Civil War. Andrew Jackson was a psychopathic slaver. He put an ad in the newspaper to catch a runaway slave in the 1830s, and at the end of the ad he said, \"I'll pay you $50 but I'll pay $10 extra for every 100 lashes you will give this enslaved person up to the amount of $300.\" Andrew Jackson was vicious and died 16 years before the Civil War even started! So the president saying [Jackson] was this great man who didn't think the Civil War was necessary, it's a complete fabrication. And how do people respond to that? Are you talking to a diverse group? My message is this: I had one of the best educations in America, and I grew up right in the middle of the civi-rights movement-and I didn't find out any of this information until seven years ago. And I am humiliated by not knowing this information. I have given this presentation all around the country, to audiences from public defenders to the American Jail Association-an association of guards in prison. The reaction is pretty uniform: people are shocked. In the trailer for the talk you say: \"We can either deal with it [the country being founded on racial superiority] realistically, or we can keep trying to deny it.\" What would it mean to deal with it realistically? It means to start having an idea of the reality of 2018. Why is it that blacks as a whole have made virtually no progress since what was reported in 1968 in the Kerner Report [the result of a federal commission's investigation into the experience of black Americans]? In March of this year, the Economic Policy Institute came out with a study 50 years after Kerner that said there's been virtually no progress in the black community. Is that because we're not intelligent or motivated? Or, is there something else going on? As we look at why people are not employed at higher levels, this is not, \"Oh it's just a fault of minority communities.... Many people think that America is segregated in its neighborhoods because of social choices and money. And that is a little bit of it, but people fail to recognize that the federal government drew red-line maps of every major city in America. And then for 30 years it was the law that they couldn't lend money to black people to buy homes in white neighborhoods. If we can demonstrate where the federal government has deliberately put its thumb on the scale to make things uneven, then I think we can have a conversation about taking our thumb off the scale. But you can't have that conversation without understanding the scale, and that's one we've never had. In the promotional video for your project, you say, \"Our history has been stolen from us.\" But you are not talking just to black people, it seems. Can you expand upon that? This is not a white or black problem, this is an American problem. And I'm not saying we don't have racism in other places in the world; we got plenty of it everywhere. What I'm trying to deal with in this project is to tell a chronicle of racism. Not the chronicle, but a chronicle. This is one of the chronicles of the black experience in America. It's about our history, all Americans, it's our collective history that's been stolen from us. Looking in the mirror is the most difficult things to do and America has avoided the mirror for a long, long time. It's time all of us take a good long look, 'cause we're not gonna like what we see-and that means you're gonna have the opportunity to do something about it.\n\n\"That is our 'Star-Spangled Banner,'\" he says, pausing to let the words sink in.

I feel like under the Obama administration we were able to delve into some of the issues and history that you are doing. But now, we can't. Do you ever feel a tension about doing this work as opposed to focusing on the triage work? No. Because I have 34 years of representing individuals who were being crushed by the criminal-justice system, one at a time. That is triage as deep as you can get. And I love that work. But for me [doing this new work] was the opposite [of a tension]. I was trying to do a reset, if you will. \"The only way we will move forward is if we have a very clear understanding of what the true history of race and racial oppression is in America.\" This is just as important. Think about President Trump saying Andrew Jackson was really upset by what he saw in the Civil War. Andrew Jackson was a psychopathic slaver. He put an ad in the newspaper to catch a runaway slave in the 1830s, and at the end of the ad he said, \"I'll pay you $50 but I'll pay $10 extra for every 100 lashes you will give this enslaved person up to the amount of $300.\" Andrew Jackson was vicious and died 16 years before the Civil War even started! So the president saying [Jackson] was this great man who didn't think the Civil War was necessary, it's a complete fabrication. And how do people respond to that? Are you talking to a diverse group? My message is this: I had one of the best educations in America, and I grew up right in the middle of the civi-rights movement-and I didn't find out any of this information until seven years ago. And I am humiliated by not knowing this information. I have given this presentation all around the country, to audiences from public defenders to the American Jail Association-an association of guards in prison. The reaction is pretty uniform: people are shocked. In the trailer for the talk you say: \"We can either deal with it [the country being founded on racial superiority] realistically, or we can keep trying to deny it.\" What would it mean to deal with it realistically? It means to start having an idea of the reality of 2018. Why is it that blacks as a whole have made virtually no progress since what was reported in 1968 in the Kerner Report [the result of a federal commission's investigation into the experience of black Americans]? In March of this year, the Economic Policy Institute came out with a study 50 years after Kerner that said there's been virtually no progress in the black community. Is that because we're not intelligent or motivated? Or, is there something else going on? As we look at why people are not employed at higher levels, this is not, \"Oh it's just a fault of minority communities.... Many people think that America is segregated in its neighborhoods because of social choices and money. And that is a little bit of it, but people fail to recognize that the federal government drew red-line maps of every major city in America. And then for 30 years it was the law that they couldn't lend money to black people to buy homes in white neighborhoods. If we can demonstrate where the federal government has deliberately put its thumb on the scale to make things uneven, then I think we can have a conversation about taking our thumb off the scale. But you can't have that conversation without understanding the scale, and that's one we've never had. In the promotional video for your project, you say, \"Our history has been stolen from us.\" But you are not talking just to black people, it seems. Can you expand upon that? This is not a white or black problem, this is an American problem. And I'm not saying we don't have racism in other places in the world; we got plenty of it everywhere. What I'm trying to deal with in this project is to tell a chronicle of racism. Not the chronicle, but a chronicle. This is one of the chronicles of the black experience in America. It's about our history, all Americans, it's our collective history that's been stolen from us. Looking in the mirror is the most difficult things to do and America has avoided the mirror for a long, long time. It's time all of us take a good long look, 'cause we're not gonna like what we see-and that means you're gonna have the opportunity to do something about it.\n\nRobinson, who joined the ACLU two and a half years ago, has been touring the country with a talk filled with these kinds of bracing revelations. It's called \" Who We Are ,\" and it traces the history of racial oppression in the United States of America. In 2011, after a death in the family, his wife's nephew was sent from New York City to live with them in Seattle. \"A lot of the [racial-justice] issues that had been critically important to me took on a new tone, because I now had a young black man in my home,\" he says. His nephew, who wanted to \"do things like other kids,\" to hang out with friend and go out at night, brought with it anxiety for Robinson. \"I started having real concern about what was going to or could happen to him.\" The result of his worry became a long study into our nation's violent racist history. There is power in knowing this history, Robinson believes, a power that will help us on the path to a more equitable society. He hopes that the talks he's given-which will culminate in New York City on June 19 in an event featuring performances by Alfre Woodard, Amy Ryan, and the Resistance Revival Chorus-will open the door to a much more expansive project around reckoning with our past. The following interview has been condensed for length and clarity. The Nation : Your event in New York City is happening on Juneteenth. What's the significance there? Juneteenth is the earliest recognized celebration of enslaved people being freed, June 19. It's a day that's been traditionally celebrated in the black community in America, and we thought it was appropriate to have that event on that day because the history of that day is so critically important to understanding how and why we got to where are in June 2018.

Something I've been thinking about a lot recently is what many of us in media do with the deluge of information we're getting. That is, when it comes to covering issues surrounding racial justice or criminal justice, a lot of the time the work being done is more about triage. I think you're absolutely right, and it's one of the reasons I've started where I have. Because the triage is like a whack-a-mole. \"There's a problem here and I'll hit it!\" and \"There's a problem there and I'll hit it!\" And you will continue to spin around hitting these problems. This has been the experience of America on race relations since the end of the Civil War. You may remember Hillary Clinton telling Black Lives Matter activists, \"You don't change hearts and minds, you change policies and procedure.\" Anything that is given to you in a policy and a procedure can be taken away in a policy or procedure. And we've seen that with the current administration revoking executive order after executive order. So that is not the answer. The triage we see, in my view, is a result of us never having had a reckoning with our true history. If you say America was founded on the concept of white supremacy, people will say that is an exaggeration, that it's a political statement. My response is: Let's go to the history books. Let's just look at what the people who founded this country said and did, because they weren't embarrassed about it. And that unknown history runs from 1619 all the way through to today. We've been treating this problem like it's a headache, and you can take aspirin and cure a headache, but if you're taking aspirin when you really have is brain cancer, it's not gonna work. We have been taking aspirin instead of chemotherapy for our problems with race for decades and decades, if not centuries. The only way we will move forward is if we have a very clear understanding of what the true history of race and racial oppression is in America. I believe that will make people take a different look into where we are now and where we need to go into the future.

He put an ad in the newspaper to catch a runaway slave in the 1830s, and at the end of the ad he said, \"I'll pay you $50 but I'll pay $10 extra for every 100 lashes you will give this enslaved person up to the amount of $300.\" Andrew Jackson was vicious and died 16 years before the Civil War even started! So the president saying [Jackson] was this great man who didn't think the Civil War was necessary, it's a complete fabrication. And how do people respond to that? Are you talking to a diverse group? My message is this: I had one of the best educations in America, and I grew up right in the middle of the civi-rights movement-and I didn't find out any of this information until seven years ago. And I am humiliated by not knowing this information. I have given this presentation all around the country, to audiences from public defenders to the American Jail Association-an association of guards in prison. The reaction is pretty uniform: people are shocked. In the trailer for the talk you say: \"We can either deal with it [the country being founded on racial superiority] realistically, or we can keep trying to deny it.\" What would it mean to deal with it realistically? It means to start having an idea of the reality of 2018. Why is it that blacks as a whole have made virtually no progress since what was reported in 1968 in the Kerner Report [the result of a federal commission's investigation into the experience of black Americans]? In March of this year, the Economic Policy Institute came out with a study 50 years after Kerner that said there's been virtually no progress in the black community. Is that because we're not intelligent or motivated? Or, is there something else going on? As we look at why people are not employed at higher levels, this is not, \"Oh it's just a fault of minority communities.... Many people think that America is segregated in its neighborhoods because of social choices and money. And that is a little bit of it, but people fail to recognize that the federal government drew red-line maps of every major city in America. And then for 30 years it was the law that they couldn't lend money to black people to buy homes in white neighborhoods. If we can demonstrate where the federal government has deliberately put its thumb on the scale to make things uneven, then I think we can have a conversation about taking our thumb off the scale. But you can't have that conversation without understanding the scale, and that's one we've never had. In the promotional video for your project, you say, \"Our history has been stolen from us.\" But you are not talking just to black people, it seems. Can you expand upon that? This is not a white or black problem, this is an American problem. And I'm not saying we don't have racism in other places in the world; we got plenty of it everywhere. What I'm trying to deal with in this project is to tell a chronicle of racism. Not the chronicle, but a chronicle. This is one of the chronicles of the black experience in America. It's about our history, all Americans, it's our collective history that's been stolen from us. Looking in the mirror is the most difficult things to do and America has avoided the mirror for a long, long time. It's time all of us take a good long look, 'cause we're not gonna like what we see-and that means you're gonna have the opportunity to do something about it.\n\nJuneteenth is the earliest recognized celebration of enslaved people being freed, June 19. It's a day that's been traditionally celebrated in the black community in America, and we thought it was appropriate to have that event on that day because the history of that day is so critically important to understanding how and why we got to where are in June 2018.

Something I've been thinking about a lot recently is what many of us in media do with the deluge of information we're getting. That is, when it comes to covering issues surrounding racial justice or criminal justice, a lot of the time the work being done is more about triage. I think you're absolutely right, and it's one of the reasons I've started where I have. Because the triage is like a whack-a-mole. \"There's a problem here and I'll hit it!\" and \"There's a problem there and I'll hit it!\" And you will continue to spin around hitting these problems. This has been the experience of America on race relations since the end of the Civil War. You may remember Hillary Clinton telling Black Lives Matter activists, \"You don't change hearts and minds, you change policies and procedure.\" Anything that is given to you in a policy and a procedure can be taken away in a policy or procedure. And we've seen that with the current administration revoking executive order after executive order. So that is not the answer. The triage we see, in my view, is a result of us never having had a reckoning with our true history. If you say America was founded on the concept of white supremacy, people will say that is an exaggeration, that it's a political statement. My response is: Let's go to the history books. Let's just look at what the people who founded this country said and did, because they weren't embarrassed about it. And that unknown history runs from 1619 all the way through to today. We've been treating this problem like it's a headache, and you can take aspirin and cure a headache, but if you're taking aspirin when you really have is brain cancer, it's not gonna work. We have been taking aspirin instead of chemotherapy for our problems with race for decades and decades, if not centuries. The only way we will move forward is if we have a very clear understanding of what the true history of race and racial oppression is in America. I believe that will make people take a different look into where we are now and where we need to go into the future. I feel like under the Obama administration we were able to delve into some of the issues and history that you are doing. But now, we can't. Do you ever feel a tension about doing this work as opposed to focusing on the triage work? No. Because I have 34 years of representing individuals who were being crushed by the criminal-justice system, one at a time. That is triage as deep as you can get. And I love that work.

But now, we can't. Do you ever feel a tension about doing this work as opposed to focusing on the triage work? No. Because I have 34 years of representing individuals who were being crushed by the criminal-justice system, one at a time. That is triage as deep as you can get. And I love that work. But for me [doing this new work] was the opposite [of a tension]. I was trying to do a reset, if you will. \"The only way we will move forward is if we have a very clear understanding of what the true history of race and racial oppression is in America.\" This is just as important. Think about President Trump saying Andrew Jackson was really upset by what he saw in the Civil War. Andrew Jackson was a psychopathic slaver. He put an ad in the newspaper to catch a runaway slave in the 1830s, and at the end of the ad he said, \"I'll pay you $50 but I'll pay $10 extra for every 100 lashes you will give this enslaved person up to the amount of $300.\" Andrew Jackson was vicious and died 16 years before the Civil War even started! So the president saying [Jackson] was this great man who didn't think the Civil War was necessary, it's a complete fabrication. And how do people respond to that? Are you talking to a diverse group? My message is this: I had one of the best educations in America, and I grew up right in the middle of the civi-rights movement-and I didn't find out any of this information until seven years ago. And I am humiliated by not knowing this information. I have given this presentation all around the country, to audiences from public defenders to the American Jail Association-an association of guards in prison. The reaction is pretty uniform: people are shocked. In the trailer for the talk you say: \"We can either deal with it [the country being founded on racial superiority] realistically, or we can keep trying to deny it.\" What would it mean to deal with it realistically? It means to start having an idea of the reality of 2018. Why is it that blacks as a whole have made virtually no progress since what was reported in 1968 in the Kerner Report [the result of a federal commission's investigation into the experience of black Americans]? In March of this year, the Economic Policy Institute came out with a study 50 years after Kerner that said there's been virtually no progress in the black community. Is that because we're not intelligent or motivated? Or, is there something else going on? As we look at why people are not employed at higher levels, this is not, \"Oh it's just a fault of minority communities.... Many people think that America is segregated in its neighborhoods because of social choices and money. And that is a little bit of it, but people fail to recognize that the federal government drew red-line maps of every major city in America. And then for 30 years it was the law that they couldn't lend money to black people to buy homes in white neighborhoods. If we can demonstrate where the federal government has deliberately put its thumb on the scale to make things uneven, then I think we can have a conversation about taking our thumb off the scale. But you can't have that conversation without understanding the scale, and that's one we've never had. In the promotional video for your project, you say, \"Our history has been stolen from us.\" But you are not talking just to black people, it seems. Can you expand upon that? This is not a white or black problem, this is an American problem. And I'm not saying we don't have racism in other places in the world; we got plenty of it everywhere. What I'm trying to deal with in this project is to tell a chronicle of racism. Not the chronicle, but a chronicle. This is one of the chronicles of the black experience in America. It's about our history, all Americans, it's our collective history that's been stolen from us. Looking in the mirror is the most difficult things to do and America has avoided the mirror for a long, long time.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Please, help make our essential independent journalism possible with a donation today.\n\nIn solidarity,\n\nThe Editors\n\nThe Nation\n\nCollier Meyerson Collier Meyerson is a Knobler Fellow at the Nation Institute, where she focuses on reporting about race and politics, and an investigative fellow at Reveal."

When I say \"worse,\" I don't mean by a metric of homes owned or acres plowed or yachts docked or whatever measure white people mean when they bemoan doing worse than their parents. In fact, I'm doing better than my parents economically, as are a visible minority of Black people my age (I'm 43). Instead, I mean that I inherited a legacy of civil rights, a stone of freedom each Black generation since emancipation has pushed relentlessly through peaks and valleys towards the summit of equality, but mine will be the first generation to lose more ground than we've gained. We will leave our kids further from the promised land than our parents left us. White Americans my age are one step removed from their \"Greatest Generation.\" It was their grandparents who went to Europe to fight the Nazis and then returned and settled right back into the apartheid system that was well-established here. The Black civil rights generation, our greatest generation , fought those forces of fascism and white supremacy here, on the home front, several years later, and in so doing forced America to live up to its empty promises of freedom and equality for all. Thanks to their efforts, my generation was born into more opportunity than any generation of Black folks in the history of the New World. We haven't squandered it. My Black generation has enjoyed unprecedented social and cultural influence. Some of us have achieved wild economic success. We even got to see the very first Black president. If you start the clock in April 1947, when Jackie Robinson broke the color line in Major League Baseball, you'll see that Black Americans have accomplished one of the most successful nonviolent political and social revolutions in human history. But my generation has not been the cause of those victories, merely the beneficiaries of our parents' and grandparents' successes. Even Barack Obama understood that. When he met Ruby Bridges, the woman who, at the age of 6, integrated the first elementary school in Louisiana, Obama said , \"I think it's fair to say that if it wasn't for you guys, I wouldn't be here today.\" Maybe that's why white people are trying to ban Bridges's story today. A new Tennessee law bars the teaching of Critical Race Theory in public schools. While there is, obviously, no such teaching going on in Tennessee public schools-Critical Race Theory is, for the 1,000th time, an academic legal discipline-the white parents pushing this know what they're after.

My generation has lived to see white people try to erase those gains. Current Issue View our current issue And those white people are winning. I know they are. I could see them winning when I saw the tears streaming down my mother's face as I tried to explain to her the Supreme Court's latest decision on voting rights . My mother was born in 1950 in Mississippi. She used to have to wait outside her town's only public library for nice white people to bring her books, since she wasn't allowed inside. She marched and wrote and was the \"first Black\" to do literally everything she did in her career. She says she fought those battles so I wouldn't have to, and for the most part I didn't. By the time I got to college, I was pretty sure we were just a few economic empowerment zones and a legalized marijuana law away from being forever free. Now, closer to the end of her life than to the start, she has to watch as white people roll back the clock and erect hurdles for her grandchildren that she thought were long vanquished. White people aren't just trying to erase the gains of the civil rights era from our voting system or support the state-sponsored terrorism and violence that has always threatened Black bodies-they're trying to erase the civil rights era's accomplishments from the national consciousness through their constant attacks on \"woke\" culture and resistance to an accurate telling of American history. I can scarcely appreciate what my mom and countless Black people her age are going through, but I doubt that most white people can even imagine it. The Voting Rights Act is arguably the most important piece of legislation in American history: It's the first law that made real the promises of the 15th Amendment, and thus the first law that extended the full measure of citizenship to Black people in a supposedly democratic system of government. It was the silver bullet of the civil rights movement. Voting rights were supposed to make it impossible for future cabals of white supremacists to take away the gains of the era. Yet, over the past eight years, that most critical law has been gutted by the Supreme Court. Our one unelected branch of government has taken away the key thing put in place to keep the elected branches from sliding back into the whites'-only rule that plagued the first 150 years of the American experiment. There's no white American equivalent to the Voting Rights Act. There's no thing we can weaken or take away from white people that would threaten their ability to participate in self-government. My Black generation is doing everything we can think of to stop this. Our activists have used every tool available to start entire movements, like Black Lives Matter, to halt this onslaught of white rage. Our thinkers and writers are on fire: People like Nikole Hannah-Jones, Kimberlé Crenshaw, Michelle Alexander, and so many others, are producing the works that leave the white supremacists so unable to compete in the marketplace of ideas that their only resort is to try to ban these Black intellectuals from the marketplace. Black voting power is so strong and energized that white Republicans have decided to turn their backs on democracy all together. We are fighting. But we are also losing, primarily because the mass of white Americans has become inured to shame. Just look at where we are with police brutality. The pervasiveness of the camera phone has, finally, shown white people the police brutality Black people have always endured. White people now can see with their own eyes what really happens when we are stopped for \"driving while Black.\" They can assess with moving pictures the difference in how police respond to groups of Black protesters versus how they respond to mobs of white insurrectionists. But white people still have a stranglehold on national political power in this country, and they are unmoved. Despite all the protest and activism my generation can muster, despite the occasional big speech from a Democratic president, there is no bevy of new civil rights legislation. The few laws that have been proposed have been blocked by Republicans. The most concerted legislative reaction to protests after the death of George Floyd was the Republican effort in a number of state legislatures to make it legal to run over Black protesters . My parents braved dogs to protest for their rights-my kids will have to brave SUVs when it's their turn to do the same. It's no coincidence that the most vicious attacks on Black equality come down at the state level, as \"states' rights\" has always been the battle cry of the racists. And this is where my generation has failed to take the next step, I think: in our failure to turn our activism and political success at the local level into gains at the statehouse and within state legislatures. Here is the full list of our current Black governors:... No, I'm not missing anybody. We are at zero right now. Now here is the exhaustive list of all Black people elected governor in US history: Douglas Wilder: Virginia, 1990-94 Deval Patrick: Massachusetts, 2007-15 Of course, there should be more. Stacey Abrams would have been the first Black woman governor, if white people hadn't stolen the election from her. And she might still be. Her career is far from over. More from Mystal Bigots Have Finally Accomplished Their Goal of Gutting the Voting Rights Act Elie Mystal Joe Biden and the Age of Blaxhaustion Elie Mystal The Miseducation of White Children Elie Mystal Abrams, 47, represents the best my generation has to offer. She's every bit the equal of the civil rights heroes that came before her, and she's doing all my generation can right now: holding the line. We're not trying to advance rights so much as we're trying to prevent white people from taking away rights we've already won. We're fighting with both hands to hang on, to preserve what we can until the cavalry arrives, until the browning majority of the country demands representation, until the Boomers die off, until the younger generations can straight up out-vote them, until something breaks the current white supremacist fever sweeping across the land. If we can hold, maybe our kids can fight the battles we could not win. But that is cold comfort. My 8-year-old told me he wants to be a \"scientist.\" I told him that Albert Einstein's greatest insight was recognizing when to get out of Nazi Germany before the fascists could kill him (and having enough star power to do what most other Jews could not), and that he might have to flee America one day too. Half of the time, I feel like my parenting inspiration is Sarah Connor in Terminator 2 . I'm training my kids to survive post-democracy and post-climate disaster America as opposed to figuring out myself how to avoid it. It's a sad inversion of what my mother said to me. She fought so I wouldn't have to. I fight so my kids have the opportunity to fight. The dream where our Black children don't have to fight for their equality and dignity under the law will have to be deferred, for another generation at least.\n\nWhen I say \"worse,\" I don't mean by a metric of homes owned or acres plowed or yachts docked or whatever measure white people mean when they bemoan doing worse than their parents. In fact, I'm doing better than my parents economically, as are a visible minority of Black people my age (I'm 43). Instead, I mean that I inherited a legacy of civil rights, a stone of freedom each Black generation since emancipation has pushed relentlessly through peaks and valleys towards the summit of equality, but mine will be the first generation to lose more ground than we've gained. We will leave our kids further from the promised land than our parents left us. White Americans my age are one step removed from their \"Greatest Generation.\" It was their grandparents who went to Europe to fight the Nazis and then returned and settled right back into the apartheid system that was well-established here. The Black civil rights generation, our greatest generation , fought those forces of fascism and white supremacy here, on the home front, several years later, and in so doing forced America to live up to its empty promises of freedom and equality for all. Thanks to their efforts, my generation was born into more opportunity than any generation of Black folks in the history of the New World. We haven't squandered it. My Black generation has enjoyed unprecedented social and cultural influence. Some of us have achieved wild economic success. We even got to see the very first Black president. If you start the clock in April 1947, when Jackie Robinson broke the color line in Major League Baseball, you'll see that Black Americans have accomplished one of the most successful nonviolent political and social revolutions in human history. But my generation has not been the cause of those victories, merely the beneficiaries of our parents' and grandparents' successes. Even Barack Obama understood that. When he met Ruby Bridges, the woman who, at the age of 6, integrated the first elementary school in Louisiana, Obama said , \"I think it's fair to say that if it wasn't for you guys, I wouldn't be here today.\" Maybe that's why white people are trying to ban Bridges's story today. A new Tennessee law bars the teaching of Critical Race Theory in public schools. While there is, obviously, no such teaching going on in Tennessee public schools-Critical Race Theory is, for the 1,000th time, an academic legal discipline-the white parents pushing this know what they're after.

She's every bit the equal of the civil rights heroes that came before her, and she's doing all my generation can right now: holding the line. We're not trying to advance rights so much as we're trying to prevent white people from taking away rights we've already won. We're fighting with both hands to hang on, to preserve what we can until the cavalry arrives, until the browning majority of the country demands representation, until the Boomers die off, until the younger generations can straight up out-vote them, until something breaks the current white supremacist fever sweeping across the land. If we can hold, maybe our kids can fight the battles we could not win. But that is cold comfort. My 8-year-old told me he wants to be a \"scientist.\" I told him that Albert Einstein's greatest insight was recognizing when to get out of Nazi Germany before the fascists could kill him (and having enough star power to do what most other Jews could not), and that he might have to flee America one day too. Half of the time, I feel like my parenting inspiration is Sarah Connor in Terminator 2 . I'm training my kids to survive post-democracy and post-climate disaster America as opposed to figuring out myself how to avoid it. It's a sad inversion of what my mother said to me. She fought so I wouldn't have to. I fight so my kids have the opportunity to fight. The dream where our Black children don't have to fight for their equality and dignity under the law will have to be deferred, for another generation at least.\n\nBut my generation has not been the cause of those victories, merely the beneficiaries of our parents' and grandparents' successes. Even Barack Obama understood that. When he met Ruby Bridges, the woman who, at the age of 6, integrated the first elementary school in Louisiana, Obama said , \"I think it's fair to say that if it wasn't for you guys, I wouldn't be here today.\" Maybe that's why white people are trying to ban Bridges's story today. A new Tennessee law bars the teaching of Critical Race Theory in public schools. While there is, obviously, no such teaching going on in Tennessee public schools-Critical Race Theory is, for the 1,000th time, an academic legal discipline-the white parents pushing this know what they're after. They highlighted four books they wanted taken out of the Tennessee curriculum; Ruby Bridges Goes to School: My True Story , by Ruby Bridges, was one of them.

My generation has lived to see white people try to erase those gains. Current Issue View our current issue And those white people are winning. I know they are. I could see them winning when I saw the tears streaming down my mother's face as I tried to explain to her the Supreme Court's latest decision on voting rights . My mother was born in 1950 in Mississippi. She used to have to wait outside her town's only public library for nice white people to bring her books, since she wasn't allowed inside. She marched and wrote and was the \"first Black\" to do literally everything she did in her career. She says she fought those battles so I wouldn't have to, and for the most part I didn't. By the time I got to college, I was pretty sure we were just a few economic empowerment zones and a legalized marijuana law away from being forever free. Now, closer to the end of her life than to the start, she has to watch as white people roll back the clock and erect hurdles for her grandchildren that she thought were long vanquished. White people aren't just trying to erase the gains of the civil rights era from our voting system or support the state-sponsored terrorism and violence that has always threatened Black bodies-they're trying to erase the civil rights era's accomplishments from the national consciousness through their constant attacks on \"woke\" culture and resistance to an accurate telling of American history. I can scarcely appreciate what my mom and countless Black people her age are going through, but I doubt that most white people can even imagine it. The Voting Rights Act is arguably the most important piece of legislation in American history: It's the first law that made real the promises of the 15th Amendment, and thus the first law that extended the full measure of citizenship to Black people in a supposedly democratic system of government. It was the silver bullet of the civil rights movement. Voting rights were supposed to make it impossible for future cabals of white supremacists to take away the gains of the era. Yet, over the past eight years, that most critical law has been gutted by the Supreme Court. Our one unelected branch of government has taken away the key thing put in place to keep the elected branches from sliding back into the whites'-only rule that plagued the first 150 years of the American experiment. There's no white American equivalent to the Voting Rights Act. There's no thing we can weaken or take away from white people that would threaten their ability to participate in self-government. My Black generation is doing everything we can think of to stop this. Our activists have used every tool available to start entire movements, like Black Lives Matter, to halt this onslaught of white rage. Our thinkers and writers are on fire: People like Nikole Hannah-Jones, Kimberlé Crenshaw, Michelle Alexander, and so many others, are producing the works that leave the white supremacists so unable to compete in the marketplace of ideas that their only resort is to try to ban these Black intellectuals from the marketplace. Black voting power is so strong and energized that white Republicans have decided to turn their backs on democracy all together. We are fighting. But we are also losing, primarily because the mass of white Americans has become inured to shame. Just look at where we are with police brutality. The pervasiveness of the camera phone has, finally, shown white people the police brutality Black people have always endured. White people now can see with their own eyes what really happens when we are stopped for \"driving while Black.\" They can assess with moving pictures the difference in how police respond to groups of Black protesters versus how they respond to mobs of white insurrectionists. But white people still have a stranglehold on national political power in this country, and they are unmoved. Despite all the protest and activism my generation can muster, despite the occasional big speech from a Democratic president, there is no bevy of new civil rights legislation. The few laws that have been proposed have been blocked by Republicans. The most concerted legislative reaction to protests after the death of George Floyd was the Republican effort in a number of state legislatures to make it legal to run over Black protesters . My parents braved dogs to protest for their rights-my kids will have to brave SUVs when it's their turn to do the same. It's no coincidence that the most vicious attacks on Black equality come down at the state level, as \"states' rights\" has always been the battle cry of the racists. And this is where my generation has failed to take the next step, I think: in our failure to turn our activism and political success at the local level into gains at the statehouse and within state legislatures.

White people now can see with their own eyes what really happens when we are stopped for \"driving while Black.\" They can assess with moving pictures the difference in how police respond to groups of Black protesters versus how they respond to mobs of white insurrectionists. But white people still have a stranglehold on national political power in this country, and they are unmoved. Despite all the protest and activism my generation can muster, despite the occasional big speech from a Democratic president, there is no bevy of new civil rights legislation. The few laws that have been proposed have been blocked by Republicans. The most concerted legislative reaction to protests after the death of George Floyd was the Republican effort in a number of state legislatures to make it legal to run over Black protesters . My parents braved dogs to protest for their rights-my kids will have to brave SUVs when it's their turn to do the same. It's no coincidence that the most vicious attacks on Black equality come down at the state level, as \"states' rights\" has always been the battle cry of the racists. And this is where my generation has failed to take the next step, I think: in our failure to turn our activism and political success at the local level into gains at the statehouse and within state legislatures. Here is the full list of our current Black governors:... No, I'm not missing anybody. We are at zero right now. Now here is the exhaustive list of all Black people elected governor in US history: Douglas Wilder: Virginia, 1990-94 Deval Patrick: Massachusetts, 2007-15 Of course, there should be more. Stacey Abrams would have been the first Black woman governor, if white people hadn't stolen the election from her. And she might still be. Her career is far from over. More from Mystal Bigots Have Finally Accomplished Their Goal of Gutting the Voting Rights Act Elie Mystal Joe Biden and the Age of Blaxhaustion Elie Mystal The Miseducation of White Children Elie Mystal Abrams, 47, represents the best my generation has to offer. She's every bit the equal of the civil rights heroes that came before her, and she's doing all my generation can right now: holding the line. We're not trying to advance rights so much as we're trying to prevent white people from taking away rights we've already won. We're fighting with both hands to hang on, to preserve what we can until the cavalry arrives, until the browning majority of the country demands representation, until the Boomers die off, until the younger generations can straight up out-vote them, until something breaks the current white supremacist fever sweeping across the land. If we can hold, maybe our kids can fight the battles we could not win. But that is cold comfort. My 8-year-old told me he wants to be a \"scientist.\" I told him that Albert Einstein's greatest insight was recognizing when to get out of Nazi Germany before the fascists could kill him (and having enough star power to do what most other Jews could not), and that he might have to flee America one day too. Half of the time, I feel like my parenting inspiration is Sarah Connor in Terminator 2 . I'm training my kids to survive post-democracy and post-climate disaster America as opposed to figuring out myself how to avoid it. It's a sad inversion of what my mother said to me. She fought so I wouldn't have to. I fight so my kids have the opportunity to fight. The dream where our Black children don't have to fight for their equality and dignity under the law will have to be deferred, for another generation at least.\n\nI can scarcely appreciate what my mom and countless Black people her age are going through, but I doubt that most white people can even imagine it. The Voting Rights Act is arguably the most important piece of legislation in American history: It's the first law that made real the promises of the 15th Amendment, and thus the first law that extended the full measure of citizenship to Black people in a supposedly democratic system of government. It was the silver bullet of the civil rights movement. Voting rights were supposed to make it impossible for future cabals of white supremacists to take away the gains of the era. Yet, over the past eight years, that most critical law has been gutted by the Supreme Court. Our one unelected branch of government has taken away the key thing put in place to keep the elected branches from sliding back into the whites'-only rule that plagued the first 150 years of the American experiment. There's no white American equivalent to the Voting Rights Act. There's no thing we can weaken or take away from white people that would threaten their ability to participate in self-government. My Black generation is doing everything we can think of to stop this. Our activists have used every tool available to start entire movements, like Black Lives Matter, to halt this onslaught of white rage. Our thinkers and writers are on fire: People like Nikole Hannah-Jones, Kimberlé Crenshaw, Michelle Alexander, and so many others, are producing the works that leave the white supremacists so unable to compete in the marketplace of ideas that their only resort is to try to ban these Black intellectuals from the marketplace. Black voting power is so strong and energized that white Republicans have decided to turn their backs on democracy all together. We are fighting. But we are also losing, primarily because the mass of white Americans has become inured to shame. Just look at where we are with police brutality.

My 8-year-old told me he wants to be a \"scientist.\" I told him that Albert Einstein's greatest insight was recognizing when to get out of Nazi Germany before the fascists could kill him (and having enough star power to do what most other Jews could not), and that he might have to flee America one day too. Half of the time, I feel like my parenting inspiration is Sarah Connor in Terminator 2 . I'm training my kids to survive post-democracy and post-climate disaster America as opposed to figuring out myself how to avoid it. It's a sad inversion of what my mother said to me. She fought so I wouldn't have to. I fight so my kids have the opportunity to fight. The dream where our Black children don't have to fight for their equality and dignity under the law will have to be deferred, for another generation at least.\n\nIf we can hold, maybe our kids can fight the battles we could not win.

Yet the partisan battle for Black support has intensified during the Trump era. Polls and surveys showed that Donald Trump made small inroads with Black male voters in 2016, and chipped away further at the Democrats' historic advantage with that demographic in 2020. And now, in a narrow, hard-fought contest between Trump and African American nominee Kamala Harris, Democratic leaders and strategists have brought a fresh edge to the quest for Black male votes. Harris herself has downplayed the notion that any Black vote is the rightful sole possession of Democrats, instead stressing that it must be \"earned\"-but that's not the dominant strain of rhetoric coming from other party leaders. More and more, anxious Democrats are prone to speak and act as if Black men who do not support the Democratic Party are guilty of an act of racial betrayal. Take, as just one prominent recent example, the scolding that Barack Obama delivered to his Back male audience as he stumped for Harris in East Liberty, Penn. Speaking to a group of committed Harris supporters who were volunteering for her campaign, Obama oddly went out of his way to castigate Black men for hesitating to support a female presidential candidate. \"My understanding, based on reports I'm getting from campaigns and communities, is that we have not yet seen the same kinds of energy and turnout in all quarters of our neighborhoods and communities as we saw when I was running,\" Obama said. He went on to note that the problem \"seems to be more pronounced with the brothers.\" In an effort to reverse the decline of Black men's support for the Democratic Party, Harris recently released an \"Opportunity Agenda for Black Men.\" The plan would provide 1 million forgivable loans of up to $20,000 to Black entrepreneurs to start a business. Harris's program also includes education, training, and mentorship initiatives to help Black men secure \"good-paying\" jobs in high-demand sectors, including pathways to becoming teachers. Harris also advocates the legalization of recreational marijuana, thereby opening up new opportunities for Black Americans to succeed in the cannabis industry while eliminating at least one source of racialized over-policing. She also proposes to safeguard cryptocurrency investments for the roughly one-fifth of Black Americans who own crypto assets. As the grab-bag character of these proposals suggests, Harris's plan is less a full-blown agenda than an attempt to answer a question that our current politics cannot address directly: What should the federal government do for Black men? Any answer fails because there is no policy Harris can advance that only benefits Black people. (Indeed, it's far from clear how any of her proposals are specifically targeted to Black men, unless one perpetrates the stereotype that they are disproportionately heavy weed smokers.)

Again, look at the marijuana plank. Legalizing marijuana would undoubtedly help reduce arrests among Black offenders; however, the real problem here is the way Black Americans are policed at large-the legality of a given controlled substance plays a lamentably small role in the practice of police brutality or over-policing, as a former prosecutor like Harris well knows. Current Issue View our current issue Or take the education proposal. It's also a worthy goal to increase the number of Black men in education. Research shows that when Black students have a Black teacher, they earn higher test scores and are more likely to graduate from college. But here again, the deeper issue is structural: Black teachers have higher turnover rates than white teachers. (I know because I used to be one.) After Black teachers enter the profession, they often leave because of low pay, or because school administrators fail to support them, or value their contributions in the classroom. Harris's defense of crypto investments, meanwhile, is less virtuous on the merits. I have written for The Nation about the ways that the push to herd Black men into the cryptocurrency market exploits the well-worn social myth of Black self-help as the surest path to collective self-determination. As I noted then, the formula here is simple: \"Lure African Americans into the dream of wealth building, then pillage the wealth of unsuspecting Black investors on a still greater.... Because Black Americans have been denied the ability to build wealth through more stable and conventional channels, they are more likely to be drawn to cryptocurrency and other sketchy financial instruments billed as more accessible and democratic paths to investment wealth.\" Laid alongside the proposals to treat over-policing and education deficits in the Black community with surface-level and symbolic overtures, the crypto plank in Harris's agenda is a revealing lapse into long-standing bootstraps nostrums favored by neoliberal Democratic leaders. These scold-first postures run the gamut from Bill Clinton's cynical dressing down of Sistah Souljah in the 1992 campaign to Obama's own pet racial initiative, My Brother's Keeper, which revived the 1960s-era moral panic over the Black family's abiding dysfunctions as an incoherent response to the vigilante slaying of Trayvon Martin. In the absence of any viable political path forward permitting Black men to call out the genuine material deprivations behind their plight, they instead find themselves conscripted into roles as stock culture-war villains-or, at best, as wayward entrepreneurs requiring assistance in husbanding their investments in a financial sector that just happens to be the fastest-growing source of campaign donations . And so despite the belated assistance that Harris's agenda seeks to muster in remedying the Democrats' Black male voter problem, it's still the scolding reflex that stands out in highest relief. Back in East Liberty, Obama expanded on his sermon to \"the brothers,\" admonishing Black men for casting around for ready rationalizations for withholding their support from Harris. \"And you're coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses, I've got a problem with that,\" Obama said. \"Because part of it makes me think-and I'm speaking to [Black] men directly-part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you're coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that.\" \"The women in our lives have been getting our backs this entire time,\" Obama continued. \"When we get in trouble and the system isn't working for us, they're the ones out there marching and protesting. And now, you're thinking about sitting out or supporting somebody who has a history of denigrating you, because you think that's a sign of strength, because that's what being a man is? Putting women down? That's not acceptable.\" A man in front of Obama said, \"I'm not.\" Obama replied, \"Cousin Pooky might.\" Indeed, some Black men are sexist; however, that sexism is not more pernicious than the sexism that exists among white men, nor is Black male sexism a particular brand of sexism that only exists in the Black community-we live in a sexist country that pollutes all men and violates all women. The rote admonitions that Obama has offered are actually rooted in the oldest mythology of Black male behavior: Any transgression committed by Black men is worse. This formula is applied in all sorts of setting to demonize Black men: Crime in general is bad, but \"Black-on-Black-crime\" is a pathology created by absent Black fathers and self-hating Black male youth that have no reverence for their race. A white Trump supporter is terrible, but the only thing worse than a white Trump supporter is a Black one. It's undeniably the case, as Democratic leaders insist, that Donald Trump's defeat is an urgent mandate. A second Trump presidency would be a stain on the United States and would perhaps irreparably damage its credibility as a functioning democracy. But if Democrats and Kamala Harris are truly serious about engaging Black men's support, they should short-circuit the sermonizing. Instead, they should meet Black men with the same compassion the party affords to their white male counterparts who have already gone over to Trump. Here , by way of instructive contrast, is Obama in 2018 talking about white male Trump supporters: Democracy demands that we're able also to get inside the reality of people who are different than us so we can understand their point of view. Maybe we can change their minds, but maybe they'll change ours. And you can't do this if you just out of hand disregard what your opponents have to say from the start. And you can't do it if you insist that those who aren't like you-because they are white, or because they are male-that somehow there's no way they can understand what I'm feeling, that somehow they lack standing to speak on certain matters. This is, to put it mildly, a pronounced departure from Obama's \"no excuses\" rhetoric that he deploys when speaking to Black men who are not even engaged in the behavior he is condemning. So what would it take to bring the Democrats' appeal to Black men into line with this same kind of reasoning? Here's a start, at least: Black men should refrain from supporting Trump because Trump is a rapist, a white supremacist who supports forced birth, and thinks the results of the Civil War were \" questionable .\" Black men should not vote for Trump because he menaces non-white communities, fomented a coup attempt to overturn the results of an election, and proposes suspending the Constitution and turning the military loose on his political opponents. There's at least the promise of genuine civic opportunity for Black men in that agenda, since it treats them like equal political subjects, and not a problem for neoliberal social engineers to solve.\n\nAnd now, in a narrow, hard-fought contest between Trump and African American nominee Kamala Harris, Democratic leaders and strategists have brought a fresh edge to the quest for Black male votes. Harris herself has downplayed the notion that any Black vote is the rightful sole possession of Democrats, instead stressing that it must be \"earned\"-but that's not the dominant strain of rhetoric coming from other party leaders.

There's at least the promise of genuine civic opportunity for Black men in that agenda, since it treats them like equal political subjects, and not a problem for neoliberal social engineers to solve.\n\n\"My understanding, based on reports I'm getting from campaigns and communities, is that we have not yet seen the same kinds of energy and turnout in all quarters of our neighborhoods and communities as we saw when I was running,\" Obama said. He went on to note that the problem \"seems to be more pronounced with the brothers.\" In an effort to reverse the decline of Black men's support for the Democratic Party, Harris recently released an \"Opportunity Agenda for Black Men.\" The plan would provide 1 million forgivable loans of up to $20,000 to Black entrepreneurs to start a business. Harris's program also includes education, training, and mentorship initiatives to help Black men secure \"good-paying\" jobs in high-demand sectors, including pathways to becoming teachers. Harris also advocates the legalization of recreational marijuana, thereby opening up new opportunities for Black Americans to succeed in the cannabis industry while eliminating at least one source of racialized over-policing. She also proposes to safeguard cryptocurrency investments for the roughly one-fifth of Black Americans who own crypto assets. As the grab-bag character of these proposals suggests, Harris's plan is less a full-blown agenda than an attempt to answer a question that our current politics cannot address directly: What should the federal government do for Black men? Any answer fails because there is no policy Harris can advance that only benefits Black people. (Indeed, it's far from clear how any of her proposals are specifically targeted to Black men, unless one perpetrates the stereotype that they are disproportionately heavy weed smokers.)

Again, look at the marijuana plank. Legalizing marijuana would undoubtedly help reduce arrests among Black offenders; however, the real problem here is the way Black Americans are policed at large-the legality of a given controlled substance plays a lamentably small role in the practice of police brutality or over-policing, as a former prosecutor like Harris well knows. Current Issue View our current issue Or take the education proposal. It's also a worthy goal to increase the number of Black men in education. Research shows that when Black students have a Black teacher, they earn higher test scores and are more likely to graduate from college. But here again, the deeper issue is structural: Black teachers have higher turnover rates than white teachers. (I know because I used to be one.) After Black teachers enter the profession, they often leave because of low pay, or because school administrators fail to support them, or value their contributions in the classroom. Harris's defense of crypto investments, meanwhile, is less virtuous on the merits. I have written for The Nation about the ways that the push to herd Black men into the cryptocurrency market exploits the well-worn social myth of Black self-help as the surest path to collective self-determination. As I noted then, the formula here is simple: \"Lure African Americans into the dream of wealth building, then pillage the wealth of unsuspecting Black investors on a still greater.... Because Black Americans have been denied the ability to build wealth through more stable and conventional channels, they are more likely to be drawn to cryptocurrency and other sketchy financial instruments billed as more accessible and democratic paths to investment wealth.\" Laid alongside the proposals to treat over-policing and education deficits in the Black community with surface-level and symbolic overtures, the crypto plank in Harris's agenda is a revealing lapse into long-standing bootstraps nostrums favored by neoliberal Democratic leaders. These scold-first postures run the gamut from Bill Clinton's cynical dressing down of Sistah Souljah in the 1992 campaign to Obama's own pet racial initiative, My Brother's Keeper, which revived the 1960s-era moral panic over the Black family's abiding dysfunctions as an incoherent response to the vigilante slaying of Trayvon Martin. In the absence of any viable political path forward permitting Black men to call out the genuine material deprivations behind their plight, they instead find themselves conscripted into roles as stock culture-war villains-or, at best, as wayward entrepreneurs requiring assistance in husbanding their investments in a financial sector that just happens to be the fastest-growing source of campaign donations . And so despite the belated assistance that Harris's agenda seeks to muster in remedying the Democrats' Black male voter problem, it's still the scolding reflex that stands out in highest relief. Back in East Liberty, Obama expanded on his sermon to \"the brothers,\" admonishing Black men for casting around for ready rationalizations for withholding their support from Harris. \"And you're coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses, I've got a problem with that,\" Obama said. \"Because part of it makes me think-and I'm speaking to [Black] men directly-part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you're coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that.\" \"The women in our lives have been getting our backs this entire time,\" Obama continued. \"When we get in trouble and the system isn't working for us, they're the ones out there marching and protesting. And now, you're thinking about sitting out or supporting somebody who has a history of denigrating you, because you think that's a sign of strength, because that's what being a man is? Putting women down? That's not acceptable.\" A man in front of Obama said, \"I'm not.\" Obama replied, \"Cousin Pooky might.\" Indeed, some Black men are sexist; however, that sexism is not more pernicious than the sexism that exists among white men, nor is Black male sexism a particular brand of sexism that only exists in the Black community-we live in a sexist country that pollutes all men and violates all women. The rote admonitions that Obama has offered are actually rooted in the oldest mythology of Black male behavior: Any transgression committed by Black men is worse. This formula is applied in all sorts of setting to demonize Black men: Crime in general is bad, but \"Black-on-Black-crime\" is a pathology created by absent Black fathers and self-hating Black male youth that have no reverence for their race. A white Trump supporter is terrible, but the only thing worse than a white Trump supporter is a Black one. It's undeniably the case, as Democratic leaders insist, that Donald Trump's defeat is an urgent mandate. A second Trump presidency would be a stain on the United States and would perhaps irreparably damage its credibility as a functioning democracy. But if Democrats and Kamala Harris are truly serious about engaging Black men's support, they should short-circuit the sermonizing. Instead, they should meet Black men with the same compassion the party affords to their white male counterparts who have already gone over to Trump. Here , by way of instructive contrast, is Obama in 2018 talking about white male Trump supporters: Democracy demands that we're able also to get inside the reality of people who are different than us so we can understand their point of view. Maybe we can change their minds, but maybe they'll change ours. And you can't do this if you just out of hand disregard what your opponents have to say from the start. And you can't do it if you insist that those who aren't like you-because they are white, or because they are male-that somehow there's no way they can understand what I'm feeling, that somehow they lack standing to speak on certain matters. This is, to put it mildly, a pronounced departure from Obama's \"no excuses\" rhetoric that he deploys when speaking to Black men who are not even engaged in the behavior he is condemning.

In the absence of any viable political path forward permitting Black men to call out the genuine material deprivations behind their plight, they instead find themselves conscripted into roles as stock culture-war villains-or, at best, as wayward entrepreneurs requiring assistance in husbanding their investments in a financial sector that just happens to be the fastest-growing source of campaign donations . And so despite the belated assistance that Harris's agenda seeks to muster in remedying the Democrats' Black male voter problem, it's still the scolding reflex that stands out in highest relief. Back in East Liberty, Obama expanded on his sermon to \"the brothers,\" admonishing Black men for casting around for ready rationalizations for withholding their support from Harris. \"And you're coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses, I've got a problem with that,\" Obama said. \"Because part of it makes me think-and I'm speaking to [Black] men directly-part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you're coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that.\" \"The women in our lives have been getting our backs this entire time,\" Obama continued. \"When we get in trouble and the system isn't working for us, they're the ones out there marching and protesting. And now, you're thinking about sitting out or supporting somebody who has a history of denigrating you, because you think that's a sign of strength, because that's what being a man is? Putting women down? That's not acceptable.\" A man in front of Obama said, \"I'm not.\" Obama replied, \"Cousin Pooky might.\" Indeed, some Black men are sexist; however, that sexism is not more pernicious than the sexism that exists among white men, nor is Black male sexism a particular brand of sexism that only exists in the Black community-we live in a sexist country that pollutes all men and violates all women. The rote admonitions that Obama has offered are actually rooted in the oldest mythology of Black male behavior: Any transgression committed by Black men is worse. This formula is applied in all sorts of setting to demonize Black men: Crime in general is bad, but \"Black-on-Black-crime\" is a pathology created by absent Black fathers and self-hating Black male youth that have no reverence for their race. A white Trump supporter is terrible, but the only thing worse than a white Trump supporter is a Black one. It's undeniably the case, as Democratic leaders insist, that Donald Trump's defeat is an urgent mandate. A second Trump presidency would be a stain on the United States and would perhaps irreparably damage its credibility as a functioning democracy. But if Democrats and Kamala Harris are truly serious about engaging Black men's support, they should short-circuit the sermonizing. Instead, they should meet Black men with the same compassion the party affords to their white male counterparts who have already gone over to Trump. Here , by way of instructive contrast, is Obama in 2018 talking about white male Trump supporters: Democracy demands that we're able also to get inside the reality of people who are different than us so we can understand their point of view. Maybe we can change their minds, but maybe they'll change ours. And you can't do this if you just out of hand disregard what your opponents have to say from the start. And you can't do it if you insist that those who aren't like you-because they are white, or because they are male-that somehow there's no way they can understand what I'm feeling, that somehow they lack standing to speak on certain matters. This is, to put it mildly, a pronounced departure from Obama's \"no excuses\" rhetoric that he deploys when speaking to Black men who are not even engaged in the behavior he is condemning. So what would it take to bring the Democrats' appeal to Black men into line with this same kind of reasoning? Here's a start, at least: Black men should refrain from supporting Trump because Trump is a rapist, a white supremacist who supports forced birth, and thinks the results of the Civil War were \" questionable .\" Black men should not vote for Trump because he menaces non-white communities, fomented a coup attempt to overturn the results of an election, and proposes suspending the Constitution and turning the military loose on his political opponents. There's at least the promise of genuine civic opportunity for Black men in that agenda, since it treats them like equal political subjects, and not a problem for neoliberal social engineers to solve.\n\nHarris's defense of crypto investments, meanwhile, is less virtuous on the merits. I have written for The Nation about the ways that the push to herd Black men into the cryptocurrency market exploits the well-worn social myth of Black self-help as the surest path to collective self-determination. As I noted then, the formula here is simple: \"Lure African Americans into the dream of wealth building, then pillage the wealth of unsuspecting Black investors on a still greater....

And you can't do it if you insist that those who aren't like you-because they are white, or because they are male-that somehow there's no way they can understand what I'm feeling, that somehow they lack standing to speak on certain matters.\n\nThis is, to put it mildly, a pronounced departure from Obama's \"no excuses\" rhetoric that he deploys when speaking to Black men who are not even engaged in the behavior he is condemning. So what would it take to bring the Democrats' appeal to Black men into line with this same kind of reasoning? Here's a start, at least: Black men should refrain from supporting Trump because Trump is a rapist, a white supremacist who supports forced birth, and thinks the results of the Civil War were \" questionable .\" Black men should not vote for Trump because he menaces non-white communities, fomented a coup attempt to overturn the results of an election, and proposes suspending the Constitution and turning the military loose on his political opponents.

(Alamy / Marka)\n\nFour hundred years ago, \"about the latter end of August,\" an English pirate ship called the White Lion landed at Point Comfort in the Virginia Colony carrying \"not anything but 20 and odd Negroes,\" wrote colonist John Rolfe. Though this is often viewed as the starting point of slavery in what would become the United States, the anniversary is somewhat misleading. Africans, both enslaved and free, had lived in St. Augustine, in Spanish Florida, since the 1560s, and since slavery was not legally sanctioned in Virginia until the 1640s, early arrivals would have occupied a status closer to indentured servants. But those ambiguities only point to how essential people of African descent were to the establishment and development of the imperial outposts that became the United States. It was their work, as much anyone else's, that helped build the world we live in today. Books in Review Workers on Arrival: Black Labor in the Making of America By Joe William Trotter Jr. Buy this book In his new book, Workers on Arrival , the historian Joe William Trotter Jr. shows that the history of black labor in the United States is thus essential not only to understanding American racism but also to \"any discussion of the nation's productivity, politics, and the future of work in today's global economy.\" At a time when mainstream political rhetoric and analysis related to economic change still tend to center on white men displaced by job loss in manufacturing and mining, similar challenges faced by black workers are often examined through a distinct lens of racial inequality. As a result, Trotter contends, white workers are viewed as the victims of \"cultural elites and coddled minorities,\" while African American workers suffering from the very same economic and political conditions are treated as \"consumers rather than producers, as takers rather than givers, and as liabilities rather than assets.\" Reminding us that Africans were brought to the Americas \"specifically for their labor\" and that their descendants remain \"the most exploited and unequal component of the emerging modern capitalist labor force,\" Workers on Arrival provides an eloquent and essential correction to contemporary discussions of the American working class. Trotter acknowledges that he is not the first to offer this critique and cites generously from \"nearly a century of research\" and prominent African American scholars in order to demonstrate \"the centrality of the African American working class to an understanding of U.S. history.\" These include W.E.B. Du Bois's studies of black working-class communities in Philadelphia, Memphis, and other cities during the turn of the 20th century, as well as Sterling Spero and Abram L. Harris's 1931 book The Black Worker . But Trotter's achievement is to synthesize this rich body of historical scholarship into a single volume written with an eye to a general audience. Trotter's analysis adds to this scholarship as well: While emphasizing the breadth of black workers' contributions to economic development and growth, he is particularly interested in their roles building American cities. Extending an analysis developed in his 1985 book on black migration in early 20th century Milwaukee, he depicts cities as spaces of economic and political opportunity not available in rural settings. They are places where people of color-and in particular black communities-have been able to thrive. Without minimizing restrictions on jobs, housing, and civil rights, he describes how Africans established important employment niches, formed religious, civil and labor organizations, and connected with the burgeoning resistance to slavery in colonial cities from New Orleans to Boston. Enslaved and free black workers built the roads, buildings, fortifications, and other infrastructure, performed essential household and service labor, and toiled in a wide variety of crafts.

Newspapers in Boston, New York, and Charleston carried ads for the purchase of enslaved carpenters, seamstresses, bakers, and blacksmiths, and Philadelphia slave owners turned a large \"share of the ordinary trades of the city\" over to black craftspeople. Some Africans arrived with canoe building, carpentry, blacksmithing, and navigational skills, but owners and employers had obvious incentives to train enslaved workers in other artisan fields, too. Skills gave these black workers a modicum of independence, providing in some cases independent sources of income, and increased their ability to escape or purchase freedom for themselves and their loved ones. The skilled trades also helped connect them to local and international political movements, especially those opposed to slavery. Once the Northern states abolished slavery after the American Revolution, free black communities, often centered on artisan work, became hotbeds for the Underground Railroad and the growing abolitionist movement. In his discussions of the 19th century, Trotter's tendency to focus on cities can have its limitations. Highlighting Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, and others who escaped from bondage to the cities, at times he loses sight of the economic and political power wielded by those who remained behind in the rural and agricultural parts of the United States. As Du Bois observed in his 1935 book Black Reconstruction in America and as more recent studies by historians Sven Beckert, Edward Baptist, and others have confirmed, the productivity of plantation labor drove urbanization and imperial expansion on both sides of the Atlantic in the 19th century. Rejecting the prevailing view of his generation that enslaved African Americans were helpless bystanders in the conflict between Northern and Southern whites, Du Bois insisted that as a result of plantation labor's importance, the black worker was the \"founding stone of a new economic system in the nineteenth century and for the modern world, who brought the civil war in America.\" As much as free and enslaved urban artisans, enslaved agricultural workers helped make the 19th century world what it was; their refusal to continue to do this work, Du Bois added, helped end the war that liberated them and created the America we know today. In addition to discounting the significance of plantation slavery, Trotter's emphasis on the liberatory nature of urban life also overlooks the degree to which many African Americans found power and autonomy in rural settings and remained committed to agriculture well into the 20th century. That commitment prompted the people emancipated from plantations not to move to the cities after the Civil War but rather to demand \"40 acres and a mule\" and to view sharecropping as preferable to wage labor. The historian Nell Painter reminds us that the first great migration of African Americans after Emancipation was not to Northern cities but to homesteads in Kansas, Oklahoma, and other states to the west. It is true, as Trotter claims, that black men sought seasonal employment in mines, lumber camps, and railroad construction as their \"dreams [of] landownership\" faded in the face of racist violence, theft, and exploitation in the Jim Crow era. Yet even then, most viewed rural wage work as a seasonal supplement to farming. Only when the boll weevil and the collapse of international markets killed Southern agriculture did the majority of African Americans head to the cities. Current Issue View our current issue H owever, Trotter's emphasis begins to make much more sense as his narrative moves into the 20th century. As generations of black Southerners headed north in the face of Jim Crow, urban industrial employment became central to the economic and political aspirations of black workers. Black workers established small footholds in industry through strikebreaking in the 1890s, then moved rapidly into Northern cities during World War I. Most unions remained hostile to them, so African Americans joined others or formed their own. Black newspapers encouraged the exodus by advertising employment opportunities and contrasting the political and cultural offerings of cities over the rural Jim Crow South. The differences between urban and rural life for black workers were, in the early 20th century, only sharpened by the New Deal's labor legislation, which excluded agricultural and domestic employment from Social Security, collective bargaining, and the minimum-wage regulations that transformed industrial work in the 1930s and '40s and made work in the cities all the more desirable. By the beginning of World War II, roughly 3 million African Americans had moved to cities in the North and the West; by 1980, an additional 5 million had followed, turning a largely rural population into an urban working class. Even with the Great Migration, urban black workers still had to fight their way into industrial jobs. Black women primarily supported themselves and their families through domestic and personal service work, taking in laundry and sewing, and running beauty salons, bars, and other small businesses. Men sought industrial work but often ended up working in the service sector as redcaps, porters, janitors, garbage collectors, and waiters. Like the migration itself, moving into industrial work became the focus of a social movement. Trotter points out that black women had more success in industrial Southern cities, where they came to dominate low-wage labor in tobacco factories, industrial laundries, and canning plants. Black men pushed into the lowest-paid, most dangerous jobs in meatpacking, steel, automaking, and other Northern industries, but it would take the early organization of trade unions and civil rights activists to finally begin to open up other levels of industrial work to black Americans. World War II marked a turning point in this struggle, as the demand for industrial employment formed a central plank of the emerging civil rights movement. Don't Buy Where You Can't Work boycotts erupted in Philadelphia, New York, and Washington, DC, setting the stage for the 1941 March on Washington Movement against racial discrimination in the defense industry. Led by A. Philip Randolph, who headed the predominantly black Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters and Maids, the movement grew large enough that Franklin Roosevelt issued an executive order banning racial discrimination by defense contractors. With that victory, Randolph canceled the march but called for continued protests to demand a federal law banning discrimination by all employers. A few cities and states passed fair employment laws in the 1940s and '50s, but it wasn't until the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that this became federal law. Along with demands for voting rights, open housing, and equal access to public accommodations, the ability to secure well-paid union jobs formed the core of black political objectives well into the 1970s. T ragically, Trotter notes, the substantial realization of those demands \"coincided with the decline of the manufacturing economy, the resurgence of conservatism in U.S. politics, and the fall of the black urban industrial working class by the turn of the twenty-first century.\" While the general trend is well known, the speed and extent of the change were shocking. Between 1967 and 1987, New York, Chicago, Detroit, and Philadelphia lost 50 to 65 percent of their manufacturing jobs, with the steepest losses affecting black workers. Many black workers moved back into service and retail positions, but lower wages and weaker unions led to sharp increases in poverty across urban America. In the last parts of his book, Trotter describes how this economic crisis was exacerbated by aggressive policing and a rising backlash against both the social safety net and the racially egalitarian policies of the 1960s. Black workers continued to push back through organizations like the National Domestic Workers Alliance, the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists, and more recently, through movements like the Fight for $15 and Black Lives Matter. Yet the resurgence of housing and voting discrimination, the persistence of hiring discrimination and the rise of mass incarceration, coupled with the challenges of rebuilding unions in a changing economy, meant the continued decline of black workers' economic and political power. Unfortunately, the experiences of black workers are largely absent from contemporary analysis of the economic and political effects of deindustrialization. In the wake of the 2016 election, when political analysts scattered across the South and the Midwest in search of Donald Trump's blue-collar base, many uncritically accepted his assertion that rural white men and a dislocated white working class were the principal victims of the globalization of manufacturing and fossil fuel extraction. It was not just Republicans who claimed to champion the white working class, as Joe Biden garnered an early lead in the Democratic primary race by emphasizing his roots in Pennsylvania's mostly white coal country while rarely mentioning the multiracial working-class communities in Delaware that had been his political base for half a century. The journalist Henry Grabar points out that the majority of voters in Youngstown, Ohio, a frequent destination for journalists' \"heartland safaris\" after the 2016 election, are black or Latino. Sociologist Arlie Hochschild mentions in passing that African Americans are half the population of Lake Charles, Louisiana, yet she treats their experience as secondary to white workers' in her best-selling ethnography of conservatism in a refinery town. \"The collapse of manufacturing in the Mahoning Valley may have provoked a white identity crisis that the national media can't get enough of,\" Grabar notes of the area surrounding Youngstown, \"but the upheaval was more severe for black Americans.\" This oversight is not just academic, given that a decline in black working-class turnout could be as decisive in the 2020 presidential election as the conservative views of some white workers. Grabar asked a black union leader why only 10 percent of registered voters participated in a recent primary election in Youngstown, summing up her response as, \"Poverty...was crushing people's will to participate in the political process.\" The pollster Stanley Greenberg, who coined the term \"Reagan Democrat\" to describe the white working-class voters who shifted right in the 1980s, insists that a similar phenomenon was only part of the story in 2016. In places like Youngstown and Lake Charles, frustration with the economic policies of both parties has led more workers of all races to drop out of the political process altogether than to shift from one party to another. \"The Democrats don't have a 'white working-class problem,'\" Greenberg has argued. \"They have a 'working-class problem,' which progressives have been reluctant to address honestly or boldly.\" Trump's election placed the economic challenges faced by American workers at the center of political analysis, albeit in ways that distorted the racial diversity that has always defined the nation's working class.

Newspapers in Boston, New York, and Charleston carried ads for the purchase of enslaved carpenters, seamstresses, bakers, and blacksmiths, and Philadelphia slave owners turned a large \"share of the ordinary trades of the city\" over to black craftspeople. Some Africans arrived with canoe building, carpentry, blacksmithing, and navigational skills, but owners and employers had obvious incentives to train enslaved workers in other artisan fields, too. Skills gave these black workers a modicum of independence, providing in some cases independent sources of income, and increased their ability to escape or purchase freedom for themselves and their loved ones. The skilled trades also helped connect them to local and international political movements, especially those opposed to slavery. Once the Northern states abolished slavery after the American Revolution, free black communities, often centered on artisan work, became hotbeds for the Underground Railroad and the growing abolitionist movement. In his discussions of the 19th century, Trotter's tendency to focus on cities can have its limitations. Highlighting Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, and others who escaped from bondage to the cities, at times he loses sight of the economic and political power wielded by those who remained behind in the rural and agricultural parts of the United States. As Du Bois observed in his 1935 book Black Reconstruction in America and as more recent studies by historians Sven Beckert, Edward Baptist, and others have confirmed, the productivity of plantation labor drove urbanization and imperial expansion on both sides of the Atlantic in the 19th century. Rejecting the prevailing view of his generation that enslaved African Americans were helpless bystanders in the conflict between Northern and Southern whites, Du Bois insisted that as a result of plantation labor's importance, the black worker was the \"founding stone of a new economic system in the nineteenth century and for the modern world, who brought the civil war in America.\" As much as free and enslaved urban artisans, enslaved agricultural workers helped make the 19th century world what it was; their refusal to continue to do this work, Du Bois added, helped end the war that liberated them and created the America we know today. In addition to discounting the significance of plantation slavery, Trotter's emphasis on the liberatory nature of urban life also overlooks the degree to which many African Americans found power and autonomy in rural settings and remained committed to agriculture well into the 20th century. That commitment prompted the people emancipated from plantations not to move to the cities after the Civil War but rather to demand \"40 acres and a mule\" and to view sharecropping as preferable to wage labor. The historian Nell Painter reminds us that the first great migration of African Americans after Emancipation was not to Northern cities but to homesteads in Kansas, Oklahoma, and other states to the west. It is true, as Trotter claims, that black men sought seasonal employment in mines, lumber camps, and railroad construction as their \"dreams [of] landownership\" faded in the face of racist violence, theft, and exploitation in the Jim Crow era. Yet even then, most viewed rural wage work as a seasonal supplement to farming. Only when the boll weevil and the collapse of international markets killed Southern agriculture did the majority of African Americans head to the cities. Current Issue View our current issue H owever, Trotter's emphasis begins to make much more sense as his narrative moves into the 20th century. As generations of black Southerners headed north in the face of Jim Crow, urban industrial employment became central to the economic and political aspirations of black workers. Black workers established small footholds in industry through strikebreaking in the 1890s, then moved rapidly into Northern cities during World War I. Most unions remained hostile to them, so African Americans joined others or formed their own. Black newspapers encouraged the exodus by advertising employment opportunities and contrasting the political and cultural offerings of cities over the rural Jim Crow South. The differences between urban and rural life for black workers were, in the early 20th century, only sharpened by the New Deal's labor legislation, which excluded agricultural and domestic employment from Social Security, collective bargaining, and the minimum-wage regulations that transformed industrial work in the 1930s and '40s and made work in the cities all the more desirable. By the beginning of World War II, roughly 3 million African Americans had moved to cities in the North and the West; by 1980, an additional 5 million had followed, turning a largely rural population into an urban working class. Even with the Great Migration, urban black workers still had to fight their way into industrial jobs. Black women primarily supported themselves and their families through domestic and personal service work, taking in laundry and sewing, and running beauty salons, bars, and other small businesses. Men sought industrial work but often ended up working in the service sector as redcaps, porters, janitors, garbage collectors, and waiters. Like the migration itself, moving into industrial work became the focus of a social movement. Trotter points out that black women had more success in industrial Southern cities, where they came to dominate low-wage labor in tobacco factories, industrial laundries, and canning plants. Black men pushed into the lowest-paid, most dangerous jobs in meatpacking, steel, automaking, and other Northern industries, but it would take the early organization of trade unions and civil rights activists to finally begin to open up other levels of industrial work to black Americans. World War II marked a turning point in this struggle, as the demand for industrial employment formed a central plank of the emerging civil rights movement. Don't Buy Where You Can't Work boycotts erupted in Philadelphia, New York, and Washington, DC, setting the stage for the 1941 March on Washington Movement against racial discrimination in the defense industry. Led by A. Philip Randolph, who headed the predominantly black Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters and Maids, the movement grew large enough that Franklin Roosevelt issued an executive order banning racial discrimination by defense contractors. With that victory, Randolph canceled the march but called for continued protests to demand a federal law banning discrimination by all employers. A few cities and states passed fair employment laws in the 1940s and '50s, but it wasn't until the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that this became federal law. Along with demands for voting rights, open housing, and equal access to public accommodations, the ability to secure well-paid union jobs formed the core of black political objectives well into the 1970s. T ragically, Trotter notes, the substantial realization of those demands \"coincided with the decline of the manufacturing economy, the resurgence of conservatism in U.S. politics, and the fall of the black urban industrial working class by the turn of the twenty-first century.\" While the general trend is well known, the speed and extent of the change were shocking. Between 1967 and 1987, New York, Chicago, Detroit, and Philadelphia lost 50 to 65 percent of their manufacturing jobs, with the steepest losses affecting black workers. Many black workers moved back into service and retail positions, but lower wages and weaker unions led to sharp increases in poverty across urban America. In the last parts of his book, Trotter describes how this economic crisis was exacerbated by aggressive policing and a rising backlash against both the social safety net and the racially egalitarian policies of the 1960s. Black workers continued to push back through organizations like the National Domestic Workers Alliance, the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists, and more recently, through movements like the Fight for $15 and Black Lives Matter. Yet the resurgence of housing and voting discrimination, the persistence of hiring discrimination and the rise of mass incarceration, coupled with the challenges of rebuilding unions in a changing economy, meant the continued decline of black workers' economic and political power. Unfortunately, the experiences of black workers are largely absent from contemporary analysis of the economic and political effects of deindustrialization. In the wake of the 2016 election, when political analysts scattered across the South and the Midwest in search of Donald Trump's blue-collar base, many uncritically accepted his assertion that rural white men and a dislocated white working class were the principal victims of the globalization of manufacturing and fossil fuel extraction. It was not just Republicans who claimed to champion the white working class, as Joe Biden garnered an early lead in the Democratic primary race by emphasizing his roots in Pennsylvania's mostly white coal country while rarely mentioning the multiracial working-class communities in Delaware that had been his political base for half a century. The journalist Henry Grabar points out that the majority of voters in Youngstown, Ohio, a frequent destination for journalists' \"heartland safaris\" after the 2016 election, are black or Latino. Sociologist Arlie Hochschild mentions in passing that African Americans are half the population of Lake Charles, Louisiana, yet she treats their experience as secondary to white workers' in her best-selling ethnography of conservatism in a refinery town. \"The collapse of manufacturing in the Mahoning Valley may have provoked a white identity crisis that the national media can't get enough of,\" Grabar notes of the area surrounding Youngstown, \"but the upheaval was more severe for black Americans.\" This oversight is not just academic, given that a decline in black working-class turnout could be as decisive in the 2020 presidential election as the conservative views of some white workers. Grabar asked a black union leader why only 10 percent of registered voters participated in a recent primary election in Youngstown, summing up her response as, \"Poverty...was crushing people's will to participate in the political process.\" The pollster Stanley Greenberg, who coined the term \"Reagan Democrat\" to describe the white working-class voters who shifted right in the 1980s, insists that a similar phenomenon was only part of the story in 2016. In places like Youngstown and Lake Charles, frustration with the economic policies of both parties has led more workers of all races to drop out of the political process altogether than to shift from one party to another. \"The Democrats don't have a 'white working-class problem,'\" Greenberg has argued. \"They have a 'working-class problem,' which progressives have been reluctant to address honestly or boldly.\" Trump's election placed the economic challenges faced by American workers at the center of political analysis, albeit in ways that distorted the racial diversity that has always defined the nation's working class. If progressives want to understand how central African Americans have been to that history, they might start by reading Workers on Arrival .\n\nTrotter's analysis adds to this scholarship as well: While emphasizing the breadth of black workers' contributions to economic development and growth, he is particularly interested in their roles building American cities. Extending an analysis developed in his 1985 book on black migration in early 20th century Milwaukee, he depicts cities as spaces of economic and political opportunity not available in rural settings. They are places where people of color-and in particular black communities-have been able to thrive. Without minimizing restrictions on jobs, housing, and civil rights, he describes how Africans established important employment niches, formed religious, civil and labor organizations, and connected with the burgeoning resistance to slavery in colonial cities from New Orleans to Boston. Enslaved and free black workers built the roads, buildings, fortifications, and other infrastructure, performed essential household and service labor, and toiled in a wide variety of crafts.

Yet even then, most viewed rural wage work as a seasonal supplement to farming. Only when the boll weevil and the collapse of international markets killed Southern agriculture did the majority of African Americans head to the cities. Current Issue View our current issue H owever, Trotter's emphasis begins to make much more sense as his narrative moves into the 20th century. As generations of black Southerners headed north in the face of Jim Crow, urban industrial employment became central to the economic and political aspirations of black workers. Black workers established small footholds in industry through strikebreaking in the 1890s, then moved rapidly into Northern cities during World War I. Most unions remained hostile to them, so African Americans joined others or formed their own. Black newspapers encouraged the exodus by advertising employment opportunities and contrasting the political and cultural offerings of cities over the rural Jim Crow South. The differences between urban and rural life for black workers were, in the early 20th century, only sharpened by the New Deal's labor legislation, which excluded agricultural and domestic employment from Social Security, collective bargaining, and the minimum-wage regulations that transformed industrial work in the 1930s and '40s and made work in the cities all the more desirable. By the beginning of World War II, roughly 3 million African Americans had moved to cities in the North and the West; by 1980, an additional 5 million had followed, turning a largely rural population into an urban working class. Even with the Great Migration, urban black workers still had to fight their way into industrial jobs. Black women primarily supported themselves and their families through domestic and personal service work, taking in laundry and sewing, and running beauty salons, bars, and other small businesses. Men sought industrial work but often ended up working in the service sector as redcaps, porters, janitors, garbage collectors, and waiters. Like the migration itself, moving into industrial work became the focus of a social movement. Trotter points out that black women had more success in industrial Southern cities, where they came to dominate low-wage labor in tobacco factories, industrial laundries, and canning plants. Black men pushed into the lowest-paid, most dangerous jobs in meatpacking, steel, automaking, and other Northern industries, but it would take the early organization of trade unions and civil rights activists to finally begin to open up other levels of industrial work to black Americans. World War II marked a turning point in this struggle, as the demand for industrial employment formed a central plank of the emerging civil rights movement. Don't Buy Where You Can't Work boycotts erupted in Philadelphia, New York, and Washington, DC, setting the stage for the 1941 March on Washington Movement against racial discrimination in the defense industry. Led by A. Philip Randolph, who headed the predominantly black Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters and Maids, the movement grew large enough that Franklin Roosevelt issued an executive order banning racial discrimination by defense contractors. With that victory, Randolph canceled the march but called for continued protests to demand a federal law banning discrimination by all employers. A few cities and states passed fair employment laws in the 1940s and '50s, but it wasn't until the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that this became federal law. Along with demands for voting rights, open housing, and equal access to public accommodations, the ability to secure well-paid union jobs formed the core of black political objectives well into the 1970s. T ragically, Trotter notes, the substantial realization of those demands \"coincided with the decline of the manufacturing economy, the resurgence of conservatism in U.S. politics, and the fall of the black urban industrial working class by the turn of the twenty-first century.\" While the general trend is well known, the speed and extent of the change were shocking. Between 1967 and 1987, New York, Chicago, Detroit, and Philadelphia lost 50 to 65 percent of their manufacturing jobs, with the steepest losses affecting black workers. Many black workers moved back into service and retail positions, but lower wages and weaker unions led to sharp increases in poverty across urban America. In the last parts of his book, Trotter describes how this economic crisis was exacerbated by aggressive policing and a rising backlash against both the social safety net and the racially egalitarian policies of the 1960s. Black workers continued to push back through organizations like the National Domestic Workers Alliance, the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists, and more recently, through movements like the Fight for $15 and Black Lives Matter. Yet the resurgence of housing and voting discrimination, the persistence of hiring discrimination and the rise of mass incarceration, coupled with the challenges of rebuilding unions in a changing economy, meant the continued decline of black workers' economic and political power. Unfortunately, the experiences of black workers are largely absent from contemporary analysis of the economic and political effects of deindustrialization. In the wake of the 2016 election, when political analysts scattered across the South and the Midwest in search of Donald Trump's blue-collar base, many uncritically accepted his assertion that rural white men and a dislocated white working class were the principal victims of the globalization of manufacturing and fossil fuel extraction. It was not just Republicans who claimed to champion the white working class, as Joe Biden garnered an early lead in the Democratic primary race by emphasizing his roots in Pennsylvania's mostly white coal country while rarely mentioning the multiracial working-class communities in Delaware that had been his political base for half a century. The journalist Henry Grabar points out that the majority of voters in Youngstown, Ohio, a frequent destination for journalists' \"heartland safaris\" after the 2016 election, are black or Latino. Sociologist Arlie Hochschild mentions in passing that African Americans are half the population of Lake Charles, Louisiana, yet she treats their experience as secondary to white workers' in her best-selling ethnography of conservatism in a refinery town. \"The collapse of manufacturing in the Mahoning Valley may have provoked a white identity crisis that the national media can't get enough of,\" Grabar notes of the area surrounding Youngstown, \"but the upheaval was more severe for black Americans.\" This oversight is not just academic, given that a decline in black working-class turnout could be as decisive in the 2020 presidential election as the conservative views of some white workers. Grabar asked a black union leader why only 10 percent of registered voters participated in a recent primary election in Youngstown, summing up her response as, \"Poverty...was crushing people's will to participate in the political process.\" The pollster Stanley Greenberg, who coined the term \"Reagan Democrat\" to describe the white working-class voters who shifted right in the 1980s, insists that a similar phenomenon was only part of the story in 2016. In places like Youngstown and Lake Charles, frustration with the economic policies of both parties has led more workers of all races to drop out of the political process altogether than to shift from one party to another. \"The Democrats don't have a 'white working-class problem,'\" Greenberg has argued. \"They have a 'working-class problem,' which progressives have been reluctant to address honestly or boldly.\" Trump's election placed the economic challenges faced by American workers at the center of political analysis, albeit in ways that distorted the racial diversity that has always defined the nation's working class. If progressives want to understand how central African Americans have been to that history, they might start by reading Workers on Arrival .\n\nIn addition to discounting the significance of plantation slavery, Trotter's emphasis on the liberatory nature of urban life also overlooks the degree to which many African Americans found power and autonomy in rural settings and remained committed to agriculture well into the 20th century. That commitment prompted the people emancipated from plantations not to move to the cities after the Civil War but rather to demand \"40 acres and a mule\" and to view sharecropping as preferable to wage labor. The historian Nell Painter reminds us that the first great migration of African Americans after Emancipation was not to Northern cities but to homesteads in Kansas, Oklahoma, and other states to the west. It is true, as Trotter claims, that black men sought seasonal employment in mines, lumber camps, and railroad construction as their \"dreams [of] landownership\" faded in the face of racist violence, theft, and exploitation in the Jim Crow era.

T ragically, Trotter notes, the substantial realization of those demands \"coincided with the decline of the manufacturing economy, the resurgence of conservatism in U.S. politics, and the fall of the black urban industrial working class by the turn of the twenty-first century.\" While the general trend is well known, the speed and extent of the change were shocking. Between 1967 and 1987, New York, Chicago, Detroit, and Philadelphia lost 50 to 65 percent of their manufacturing jobs, with the steepest losses affecting black workers. Many black workers moved back into service and retail positions, but lower wages and weaker unions led to sharp increases in poverty across urban America. In the last parts of his book, Trotter describes how this economic crisis was exacerbated by aggressive policing and a rising backlash against both the social safety net and the racially egalitarian policies of the 1960s. Black workers continued to push back through organizations like the National Domestic Workers Alliance, the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists, and more recently, through movements like the Fight for $15 and Black Lives Matter. Yet the resurgence of housing and voting discrimination, the persistence of hiring discrimination and the rise of mass incarceration, coupled with the challenges of rebuilding unions in a changing economy, meant the continued decline of black workers' economic and political power. Unfortunately, the experiences of black workers are largely absent from contemporary analysis of the economic and political effects of deindustrialization. In the wake of the 2016 election, when political analysts scattered across the South and the Midwest in search of Donald Trump's blue-collar base, many uncritically accepted his assertion that rural white men and a dislocated white working class were the principal victims of the globalization of manufacturing and fossil fuel extraction. It was not just Republicans who claimed to champion the white working class, as Joe Biden garnered an early lead in the Democratic primary race by emphasizing his roots in Pennsylvania's mostly white coal country while rarely mentioning the multiracial working-class communities in Delaware that had been his political base for half a century. The journalist Henry Grabar points out that the majority of voters in Youngstown, Ohio, a frequent destination for journalists' \"heartland safaris\" after the 2016 election, are black or Latino.

Grabar asked a black union leader why only 10 percent of registered voters participated in a recent primary election in Youngstown, summing up her response as, \"Poverty...was crushing people's will to participate in the political process.\" The pollster Stanley Greenberg, who coined the term \"Reagan Democrat\" to describe the white working-class voters who shifted right in the 1980s, insists that a similar phenomenon was only part of the story in 2016. In places like Youngstown and Lake Charles, frustration with the economic policies of both parties has led more workers of all races to drop out of the political process altogether than to shift from one party to another. \"The Democrats don't have a 'white working-class problem,'\" Greenberg has argued. \"They have a 'working-class problem,' which progressives have been reluctant to address honestly or boldly.\" Trump's election placed the economic challenges faced by American workers at the center of political analysis, albeit in ways that distorted the racial diversity that has always defined the nation's working class.

But he never got the chance.\" Related Article Trump's Racial and Ethnic Hierachy: Blacks v. Mexicans and Muslims Julianne Hing The joint session wasn't Shaw's first appearance with Trump. He tagged along with him on the campaign trail and even appeared in a Willie Horton-style campaign ad that touted Trump's tough-on-immigration approach. \"Trump is the only one saying: 'You're gonna be dealt with,'\" Shaw says in the ad. But, as Bustle pointed out, between 2010 and 2014 the Department of Homeland Security counted only 121 people charged with murder after having been previously held by immigration officials, about 0.001 percent of the total number of undocumented immigrants in this country. Trump chose to highlight Shaw's case not because he wanted to emphasize the tragedy that is murder, or even just to stir up unfounded fears about the criminality of undocumented immigrants generally. He was doing something else too, something nefariously brilliant. By using Shaw, Trump was specifically pitting black Americans against undocumented immigrants, telling us that brown, undocumented immigrants will kill our families too. In doing so, Trump told us that our families matter, that we are Americans . For once, black Americans weren't the subtext of dog-whistle politics but the intended audience. The cynicism of this move comes into focus when we look at Trump's actual agenda for black communities. Outside of the tragic stories like Shaw's, black Americans don't place quite as high on the chain anywhere else in Trump's America. Take, for example, his recent executive order doubling down on and expanding protections for police officers. The order, Preventing Violence Against Federal, State, Tribal, and Local Law Enforcement Officers , will \"enforce all Federal laws in order to enhance the protection and safety of Federal, State, tribal, and local law enforcement officers,\" and \"define new federal crimes, and increase penalties for existing federal crimes, in order to prevent violence\" against officers. The order also aims to create definitions of \"new crimes of violence\" against officers and establish mandatory minimums for existing ones. Billed as a way to bolster safety and protection, the order is really a reaction against the Black Lives Matter movement and the Department of Justice's agenda under President Obama, which investigated and scrutinized police departments across the country for infringing upon the civil rights of black and brown Americans.

One of its proposals, \"Protection from Illegal Immigration\" stated that \"No group has been more economically harmed by decades of illegal immigration than low-income African-American workers.\" But other than rhetorically setting these two communities against each other in a race to the bottom, Trump's plan offers very little to actually create better jobs for black Americans, and many of his proposals-from school choice to beefing up policing to financial deregulation to ignoring climate change-would disproportionately hurt black Americans. In other words, Trump doesn't want a new deal for black America-he just wants to fasten us in tighter to the old deal of low-wage, insecure, go-nowhere jobs. The champion of black America Donald Trump is not. Instead, he is continuing to seize on the vulnerability of communities that are disenfranchised, that suffer from higher rates of joblessness, poverty, inadequate housing, and subpar education. Donald Trump isn't the first to pit Americans against one another for political gain. For a moment after reconstruction in the 1890s, a populist movement emerged, one that lead to some alliances between poor whites and blacks in the South, particularly among farmers. Tom Watson, a white Georgia politician, delivered a speech to a crowd of black and white farmers, highlighting their common interests. \"You are made to hate each other because on that hatred is rested the keystone of the arch of financial despotism which enslaves you both,\" he said. \"You are deceived and blinded because you do not see how this race antagonism perpetuates a monetary system that beggars you both.\" Watson's was an economic message: \"The colored tenant is in the same boat as the white tenant, the colored laborer with the white laborer and that the accident of color can make no difference in the interests of farmers, croppers and laborers.\" The alliance didn't grow large enough to change the course of American history. Powerful white landowners were able to convince poor whites of their racial superiority, and Jim Crow and the Ku Klux Klan would cement an America that privileges racial unity over class. Later, Watson himself turned on the black Americans he once supported. Trump knows something, like Watson did, about black Americans: We will never stop seeking out first-class citizenship. But history has also taught us to be wary of the smoke and mirrors deployed by politicians like Trump. Baiting black people and trying to pit us against Mexicans won't work when all of Trump's other policies are ruinous to black communities. Trump touts a new deal for black America, but he forgets that while blacks benefited from the original New Deal-a set of economic recovery programs that lifted America out of the Great Depression- it was not intended for us . Trump is right about one thing: Black people do want a new deal. But not one that reinforces our place as second-class citizens with a pernicious mandate to trample on the backs of those without any citizenship at all.\n\nJulianne Hing\n\nThe joint session wasn't Shaw's first appearance with Trump.

For a moment after reconstruction in the 1890s, a populist movement emerged, one that lead to some alliances between poor whites and blacks in the South, particularly among farmers. Tom Watson, a white Georgia politician, delivered a speech to a crowd of black and white farmers, highlighting their common interests. \"You are made to hate each other because on that hatred is rested the keystone of the arch of financial despotism which enslaves you both,\" he said. \"You are deceived and blinded because you do not see how this race antagonism perpetuates a monetary system that beggars you both.\" Watson's was an economic message: \"The colored tenant is in the same boat as the white tenant, the colored laborer with the white laborer and that the accident of color can make no difference in the interests of farmers, croppers and laborers.\" The alliance didn't grow large enough to change the course of American history. Powerful white landowners were able to convince poor whites of their racial superiority, and Jim Crow and the Ku Klux Klan would cement an America that privileges racial unity over class. Later, Watson himself turned on the black Americans he once supported. Trump knows something, like Watson did, about black Americans: We will never stop seeking out first-class citizenship. But history has also taught us to be wary of the smoke and mirrors deployed by politicians like Trump. Baiting black people and trying to pit us against Mexicans won't work when all of Trump's other policies are ruinous to black communities. Trump touts a new deal for black America, but he forgets that while blacks benefited from the original New Deal-a set of economic recovery programs that lifted America out of the Great Depression- it was not intended for us . Trump is right about one thing: Black people do want a new deal. But not one that reinforces our place as second-class citizens with a pernicious mandate to trample on the backs of those without any citizenship at all.\n\nTrump chose to highlight Shaw's case not because he wanted to emphasize the tragedy that is murder, or even just to stir up unfounded fears about the criminality of undocumented immigrants generally. He was doing something else too, something nefariously brilliant. By using Shaw, Trump was specifically pitting black Americans against undocumented immigrants, telling us that brown, undocumented immigrants will kill our families too. In doing so, Trump told us that our families matter, that we are Americans . For once, black Americans weren't the subtext of dog-whistle politics but the intended audience. The cynicism of this move comes into focus when we look at Trump's actual agenda for black communities. Outside of the tragic stories like Shaw's, black Americans don't place quite as high on the chain anywhere else in Trump's America. Take, for example, his recent executive order doubling down on and expanding protections for police officers. The order, Preventing Violence Against Federal, State, Tribal, and Local Law Enforcement Officers , will \"enforce all Federal laws in order to enhance the protection and safety of Federal, State, tribal, and local law enforcement officers,\" and \"define new federal crimes, and increase penalties for existing federal crimes, in order to prevent violence\" against officers. The order also aims to create definitions of \"new crimes of violence\" against officers and establish mandatory minimums for existing ones. Billed as a way to bolster safety and protection, the order is really a reaction against the Black Lives Matter movement and the Department of Justice's agenda under President Obama, which investigated and scrutinized police departments across the country for infringing upon the civil rights of black and brown Americans.

As against the old-school right-wing racism of a Ronald Reagan that relied on dog whistles about \"welfare queens\" and \"states' rights,\" Trump is a shrill police whistle blaring out alarm about immigrant rapists and killers or birther lies about former president Barack Obama. But even rancid and ridiculous racism can conceal a hidden political agenda-one that it is all too easy to ignore because our natural impulse is to be dismissive and move on.\n\nOn Wednesday in an interview at the convention of the National Association of Black Journalists in Chicago, Trump had the temerity to question the Blackness of his rival, Vice President Kamala Harris. Amid gasps of astonishment from the Black journalists in the audience, Trump falsely asserted that Harris \"was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I didn't know she was Black, until a number of years ago, when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black. So I don't know, is she Indian or is she Black? I respect either one, but she obviously doesn't.\"\n\nThe first thing to say about Trump's comment is it is factually and logically absurd. There's no reason someone can't be both Indian and Black. Harris has Indian heritage through her mother, who was born in India, and Black heritage through her father, who was born in Jamaica. Further, ethnicity is both a cultural and a biological matter, and Harris was raised in a predominately Black community in Berkeley and graduated from Howard University, one of America's most distinguished historically Black universities, where she joined Alpha Kappa Alpha, a historically Black sorority.\n\nTrump's claim went against the argument- frequently made by other Republicans -that Harris was a \"DEI [diversity, equity, and inclusion] hire\" who became vice president only because she is a Black woman.\n\nTrump's comments came from a place of desperation. After Joe Biden's decision to abandon his reelection bid, Harris quickly cemented her position as presumptive nominee of her party and surged in the polls . While Trump thought he'd cruise to victory against Biden, he is facing the real prospect of loss against Harris.\n\nThe very day Trump made his comments, Vivek Ramaswamy, tech mogul and Trump supporter, tweeted :\n\nThe hard truth is we need a massive reset right now. The criticism that Kamala mounted a coup on Biden isn't landing, neither is the claim that she covered up Biden's cognitive decline. None of that matters to voters now.\n\nTrump's new line that Harris is really an Indian was thus a replacement for earlier, failed arguments. It has the advantage of being thematically linked with the accusation that Harris is a political shape-shifter-a flip-flopper who presents herself as a moderate or progressive depending on the needs of the moment. Trump's running mate, Ohio Senator JD Vance, made this connection explicit when he defended Trump's comments by saying they were \"hysterical\" and that Trump had merely \"pointed out the fundamental chameleon-like nature of Kamala Harris.\" (Vance, of course, is hardly on solid ground himself, since he's gone from being a Never Trump Republican to a complete MAGA minion, even swallowing his pride as his multiracial family is attacked by racists.)\n\nBeyond the \"chameleon\" attack, Trump seems to be trying to open a wedge in the Black community, as New Yorker writer Jay Caspian Kang has noted . This is the divide between Black Americans who trace their origins to slavery inside this country versus Black Americans who are of more recent immigrant heritage (even if, like Harris, they have ancestors who were enslaved elsewhere). This divide has become more visible in recent years with the coinage of terms such as \"American Descendants of Slavery\" (ADOS) and Foundational Black Americans (FBA).\n\nLawyer Camera Williams has offered a useful backgrounder to Trump's agenda in opening up this contentious divide:\n\nTrump bringing up the VP's identity is a specific dog whistle for a particular sector w/i the Black community. The ADOS & FBA community. It's a pointed gambit designed to siphon votes from her otherwise strongest base.... The term \"American Descendants of Slavery\" (ADOS) was created in 2016 to describe & separate Black Americans/African Americans from Black immigrant communities.\n\nThe ADOS movement is closely aligned w/ another group of similar beliefs called Foundational Black Americans (FBA) founded by snake oil salesman, black male incel magnet & YouTuber, Tariq Nasheed. Both of these groups are funded by & have their origins in right wing think tanks.\n\nThere's a ton of stuff that easily provides bread crumbs to this Psy Op designed to wedge a divide among Black Americans. The main point is to give an anti-immigrant perspective in relation to Black identity. The Trojan horse of reparations being the noted vehicle of racial discord.\n\nWhile Williams is undeniably accurate in noting that some of the promoters of these concepts are bad-faith actors serving right-wing interests, it should also be acknowledged that these concepts spring from genuine sociological divides. Because of the horrific and continuing intergenerational history of American racism, Black immigrants often have a life trajectory very different from that of  African Americans whose family history has deeper roots in the United States.\n\nDavid J. Deming, the director of the Malcolm Wiener Center for Social Policy at the Kennedy School, told The Harvard Crimson in 2020 that \"non-generational African Americans, or non-descendants of enslaved people, tend to do better than those who are traditionally called Black.\" Denning added, \"There is something about the history of a people and the way they were treated by society in the past that carries over to today's society in ways that aren't just captured by kind of a snapshot of economic characteristics.\"\n\nThese facts have policy implications. There are real reasons for supporting anti-poverty and affirmative action measures that specifically seek to help ADOS. But these policy arguments can be disentangled from the fact that Black Americans have always been a diverse people and have included recent immigrants as well as those with long-standing national roots. After all, no serious person can deny that Marcus Garvey, Harry Belafonte, Colin Powell, Shirley Chisholm, and Barack Obama are all part of the history of Black America.\n\nBlackness is a cultural and historical fact, not a biological one. Black Americans are a nation within a nation. Like any nation, they've always had immigrants. Indeed, Black Americans have often more quickly and fully accepted immigrants within their community than white Americans have immigrants inside the actual political nation.\n\nIt is true that some racists tried to use a similar argument to discredit Obama by arguing that his African immigrant and part-white background separates him from Black America. This was not an argument that gained any significant traction with Black Americans.\n\nTrump's racist questioning of Harris's identity is likely to fail for many reasons. The argument about distinctions between Blacks of recent immigrant origins versus ADOS is an internal one to the Black community. It is one thing for Black thinkers (even ones writing in bad faith) to hash out these distinctions among themselves; it is another for a white man, particularly one with Trump's history, to raise the same questions.\n\nBut then, Trump is actively courting backlash. Just as birther attacks on Obama only strengthened his popularity with Black Americans, it is likely that Harris will see a rallying effect. We've seen groups such as White Dudes for Harris form, but imagine the power that will come from Black Ladies and Dudes for Harris, motivated by racial solidarity and a proper sense that one of their own is under attack.\n\nThere's also the very real possibility of a backlash from Indian Americans and the rapidly growing community of multiracial Americans (which includes, ironically, the family of JD Vance). Trump's crude attempt to score a point is insulting to tens of millions of Americans who know that race is not a simple black-and-white matter but often a complex mixture.\n\nTrump's desperate attack on Harris is a divide-and-conquer move-but it also offers an opportunity for Harris. Her initial impulse has been to simply dismiss Trump's comments, saying that they were the \"same old show of divisiveness and disrespect.\" This is true enough, and if Harris wanted to, she could just leave it at that.\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nElie Mystal\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nBut in politics fortune often favors the brave. What if Harris responded to Trump's provocation by using it as an occasion to talk about her own remarkable life, about the two immigrants from different parts of the world who were her parents, about how after their divorce her mother found a community among her Black neighbors in Berkeley, and about how rich and complex the Black experience in America is? Such an approach-one that drew on the autobiographical opening to her 2019 book The Truths We Hold -would not only help Harris to establish a new bond with the public but also serve to elevate the American debate about racial identity that Donald Trump has done so much to degrade.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts.

      "text": "The Messiness of Black Identity\n\n\"Black,\" as in the capitalized identifier for the people, is everywhere. Is there not a strange air to its ubiquity? A feeling of religiosity? The writer publishing in the North American press can no longer be willful when deciding how she might like to dress the word. Many style guides, including the one used by this magazine, now capitalize the \"B\": a person is Black; a culture is Black. This standard has even encroached on the genre of fiction, like a stop sign installed in the badlands. How does the satirist work around the imposition, constructing her nasty, sarcastic world of minstrelsy and sharp tongues? The race has been made proper.\n\n\"I believe that eight million Americans are entitled to a capital letter.\" This was W. E. B. Du Bois, ministering to literate society at the turn of the twentieth century, about the word \"negro.\" In 1929, Du Bois, by then a star activist and editor, the ur-Black American intellectual, made the case again in a letter to Franklin Henry Hooper, his white editor at the Encyclopædia Britannica:\n\nFirst of all, the word \"Negro\" which was capitalized in my manuscript and which is already capitalized in everything I write, has been changed to a small letter. I feel very strongly on this point. I regard the use of a small letter for the name of twelve million Americans and two hundred million human beings as a personal insult, and under no circumstances will I allow this article to be published unless the word \"Negro\" is capitalized in this article. Of course, elsewhere in the Encyclopedia you will follow your own rule.\n\nThe letter was part of a larger pressure campaign, supported by Du Bois's contemporaries Alain Locke and W. A. Robinson, targeting the Britannica, the Times , and the other bulwarks of Western media. By 1930, the Times acquiesced. \"It is not merely a typographical change, it is an act in recognition of racial respect for those who have been generations in the 'lower case,' \" the newspaper declared. A perfect echo of this dignity dogma appeared in the Times' 2020 article \" Why We're Capitalizing Black .\" An editor on the national desk is quoted as saying that \"for many people the capitalization of that one letter is the difference between a color and a culture.\" The Associated Press, in a piece announcing its adoption of the same rule, also riffed on the color-not-a-person argument, which rings to me, at its most elemental, as an erasure of the role that the Black Power and Black Pride movements played in the shaping of how the people address themselves. (\"Negro\" didn't fall away as if a deciduous leaf; \"Black\" was agitated for.)\n\nA month earlier, a police officer in Minneapolis had murdered George Floyd , pressing on his neck until he could no longer breathe. That feeling I mentioned, of a kind of religiosity associated with the capitalization of \"Black,\" stems from this context -the manic scene in which cultural institutions sought to brighten the imagined line separating them from the institutions of the state, by reasserting themselves as officers of language. The A.P., in its announcement, went full internationalist: the capitalized Black, its vice-president of standards wrote, promoted \"an essential and shared sense of history, identity and community among people who identify as Black, including those in the African diaspora and within Africa.\"\n\nThe point was to denote and to define and to dignify, to bring the diaspora of dispersed Africans, former and present, into the hall of recognition enjoyed by the proper-noun ethnic categories. To shed Jesse Jackson's heavy hyphen in the formerly enshrined \"African-American.\" To simultaneously give the Haitian, the Nigerian, and the American her distinctions while also linking them in sociological relation, implicitly rooted in an understanding of the Atlantic in which slavery launched the race. Here's where my mind gets caught on the wide net, flung across continents and across time. Everyone knows what it means to capitalize \"Black.\" But how does it feel? On your tongue, on the page? If we act like affect isn't what truly rules how we talk to, and around, one another, we won't get to the whole of the matter.\n\nAnother time, another correspondence, although this time unanswered. Donald Harris, inflamed, writes a post for a Jamaican Web site, disciplining his eldest-born child, Kamala Harris, for her wanton assimilation. During her first Presidential campaign, which, in 2019, looked like it would be her only one, Kamala Harris had gone on \"The Breakfast Club,\" a radio show that has become an almost mandatory campaign stop for politicians seeking the Black vote, where she was asked a question about whether she had ever smoked marijuana. \"Half of my family's from Jamaica,\" she replied. \"Are you kidding me?\" Her father called upon her entire matriarchal line in order to admonish her:\n\nMy dear departed grandmothers (whose extraordinary legacy I described in a recent essay on this website), as well as my deceased parents, must be turning in their grave right now to see their family's name, reputation and proud Jamaican identity being connected, in any way, jokingly or not with the fraudulent stereotype of a pot-smoking joy seeker and in the pursuit of identity politics.\n\nDonald Harris's post, just like his daughter's joke, was a kind of mannered performance. The reaming was a hit among my friends and me, all of whom have parents who come from the Caribbean. We recognized his severity and his hyperbole, and then we recognized our laughing dismissal of his severity and his hyperbole as the mark of a cultural and generational difference. It is said that we don't know much about Harris pater-aside from the fact that he is a Marxist bogeyman or miracle, depending on one's place on the political spectrum-but, from the composition of his writings about family, I think we can glean something intense. He portrays himself as the proud Jamaican father, working hard to instill a sense of racial identity in his two children, taking them to visit his old schools in Kingston and in Port Antonio, fighting against the encroaching American secularities. \"A neegroe from da eyelans,\" is how he views the court viewing him, in the seventies, as he fought for custody of his children.\n\nKamala Harris and her campaigns, past and present, have actually made it a point not to focus too much on her race, or on her gender. Last week, Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz, sat for their first televised interview , with CNN's Dana Bash. Bash asked what Harris thought of Trump's musing that she \"turned Black\" for political gain. \"Same old tired playbook,\" Harris replied, speaking not only of Trump but seemingly of media avarice. \"Next question, please.\" Right, true, and warranted. But the question of Harris's race, although mainstreamed by Trump, wasn't originated by him. There exists a loose federation of Black Americans who look upon Black non-Americans as siphons of what reparative bounty should be theirs. The descendance from slavery, according to them, baptized the real inheritors of the Black condition. (Needless to say, this is an ahistorical and inaccurate view of transatlantic slavery.) They make hay out of statistics that suggest the success of Black non-Americans: the education level of the Nigerian, the earning power of the West Indian. Their movement is called ADOS , or American Descendants of Slavery. They are few but vocal enough online that they have been falsely accused of being Russian bots. Unlike Trump, ADOS 's adherents cast a figure like Harris as something other than fraudulent; they see her, instead, as a usurper.\n\nMost Black Americans don't espouse the beliefs of ADOS . Plenty of Black Americans also have non-American ethnic identities. But the ADOS dissension is at the extreme end of a kind of conflict that is known as \"diaspora warring.\" Diaspora warring is typically petty, unserious-kitchen talk. (Who makes the best rice is always a point of argument.) But it is based in an acknowledgment of difference-that Black-as-race has supplanted, in everyday language, Blackness-as-ethnicity. In acknowledging difference, this warring, as we facetiously call it, clings to lines of demarcation. It's Samuel L. Jackson, an American, on the occasion of Jordan Peele's \" Get Out ,\" starring Daniel Kaluuya, accusing British actors of taking roles that were meant for his countrymen. It's Buju Banton, a Jamaican reggae artist, criticizing Afrobeat artists for making music that is apolitical and soulless. I think, too, of intranational conversation-critiques levelled by Black Texans, for example, toward Black Northerners, calling them out for misapprehending the regional particularity of Juneteenth . And then there's the Olympics. For years, Sha'Carri Richardson , the American sprinter, has annoyed some Jamaican track-and-field fans, who have taken her brashness as unearned hubris. Usain Bolt once played the wise man, suggesting that Richardson focus less on trash-talking and more on improving her game. This summer, during the Paris Games, some bits of the beef returned, but the mood was more playful. A couple of months earlier, Richardson had come to the Jamaica Athletics Invitational in Kingston. There, everyone took her as a sister.\n\nThat's what some want: an end to trifling rivalry. And yet it's a fiction that the Black people of this world do not practice a degree of identity policing. ADOS , for its part, manages to route its identity policing through the machinery of American exceptionalism. These people are fringe, but, as a friend of mine once said, they are not completely incoherent. If they got their act together, ADOS could pose a political threat. In 2019, Farah Stockman tried to report on ADOS for the Times . She walked away frustrated. She could not pinpoint whether the organization was trolling or serious. To put it in the vernacular: she could not decipher what's really real.\n\nAs I write, a million or so people are gathered a stone's throw from my apartment for the West Indian Day Parade, held on Eastern Parkway, in Brooklyn, New York. My mother made it a point to bring me to the parade-to hit de road-before I was old enough to walk. Both she and my father immigrated to the States from Haiti as grown adults. The spirit of Donald Harris is in them. America was not going to supplant the origin. We lived in Caribbean neighborhoods: first, myself, my sister, my parents, and sometimes a cousin shared a one-bedroom apartment on East Twenty-first Street, in Flatbush. Then we moved on up to a semidetached clapboard joint, replete with a carpeted basement and a weeping willow in the back yard, in Canarsie, newly available to us on account of a swift and nearly complete white flight, a good two miles away from the last stop on the L. At my elementary school, most students were also from the West Indies. The African American kids play-adopted islands of origin. Everyone wanted to be Jamaican. We sang the Mass, all three hours of it, in kreyòl . Summers were spent with my grandmother, in Port-au-Prince.\n\nCanarsie was where you moved when you had a little money. It was residential. To go out, you'd drive your Toyota Camry to the Flatbush area, park, and then hit the neon clubs. One night, in August of 1997, police descended on Club Rendez-Vous. They arrested Abner Louima, the security guard, brought him to the local precinct, and beat and raped him with a broomstick. That he survived, to us, made him Lazarus. The torture of Louima, as Edwidge Danticat wrote in this magazine , in 2014, as well as the brutal police killing of Amadou Diallo, a Guinean student, came to define the changing city in that decade. The men were Black and they were immigrants; the two could not be divorced.\n\nDu Bois, who died in 1963, is entombed in Accra, Ghana. The tomb is cut from stone, sloped like a bed. I visited in 2018. Ghanaians I met on my trip told me about the Year of Return, an initiative set by the government for the following year, for the four-hundredth anniversary of the first recorded shipment of African slaves to the North American colonies. The Ghanaian state marketed the program as a birthright journey, one that could inspire the permanent return-a \"Blaxit,\" if you will-of those who have been spread across the Black Atlantic, stereotyped as the lost brother. Some of the people I met liked the open play at revived Afropolitanism. Others were disgusted that the Ghanaian government would spend money trying to attract comparatively wealthy Westerners when many of the country's young population had no work.\n\nDu Bois left America in 1961, at the age of ninety-three. The nonagenarian was essentially in exile, having been declared \"un-American\" in the McCarthyite era. In the later years of his life, he became even more fixated on his steerage of Pan-Africanism. Du Bois had been a key figure in the restoration of the Pan Africanist Congress at Paris in 1919; Kwame Nkrumah, the first President of an independent Ghana, who harbored a radical vision of the continent decolonized, later invited him to Accra to work on \"Encyclopaedia Africana,\" a project Du Bois had been longing to publish for some sixty years. He died, at ninety-five, before he could complete it. The encyclopedia now exists-Kwame Anthony Appiah and Henry Louis Gates, Jr., endeavored to complete Du Bois's work, with the publication of \" Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African-American Experience ,\" in 1999.

      "text": "The Black Families Seeking Reparations in California's Gold Country\n\nDuring the final years of the Great Depression, officials in California set out to build a state park to commemorate the centennial of the discovery of gold in 1848, an event that set off the largest mass migration in U.S. history and transformed the American West. They offered to buy plots of land from a dozen local families and businesses in Coloma, in the Sacramento Valley; this was where John Marshall, nearly a hundred years earlier, had famously found gold. He discovered the precious metal in rocks near a sawmill he was building for John Sutter-a Swiss German businessman and early settler of California-on the banks of the American River. Hundreds of thousands of people from around the world swarmed the Pacific Coast to mine for gold, sparking a vast economic boom.\n\nOne of the local landowners was Pearley Monroe, who worked as a janitor in California's State Capitol building, about fifty miles away. In the late nineteen-thirties, state officials offered Monroe twenty-five hundred dollars for \"the place of shifting gravel and flowing water where Sutter's Mill once stood,\" as a local paper put it. By the nineteen-thirties, Coloma had become a faded, rural town, with few economic prospects.\n\nA Black descendant of enslaved Americans brought to California during the gold rush, Monroe was proud of the family's land holdings. He declined the offer, hoping for a higher price. Monroe's grandparents had eventually settled as free citizens in Coloma, where they raised kids and fruit orchards and became prominent, suit-wearing members of the community. Monroe inherited his part of the Sutter's Mill property and bought the rest \"on speculation,\" according to a news report.\n\nAfter the state made its offer, Monroe, who had also spurned offers from gold-dredging companies and a local historical group, set his price at ten thousand dollars. By 1941, he had become known in the papers for his stubbornness. \"I would rather see the land turned into a park and swimming pool for my people,\" he told the Los Angeles Times . That same year, California's attorney general, Earl Warren-who would later become a famed Supreme Court Chief Justice-moved to condemn the property owned by Monroe and other local families under eminent domain. In 1942, a county judge fixed the government's price for Monroe's land at just over three thousand dollars, and forced him to sell.\n\nOfficials compelled a dozen or so other local families to sell their holdings as well, and established the Marshall Gold Discovery State Historic Park, just in time for the centennial, in 1948. The property seizures affected some Asian and white families. But two large Black families descended from enslaved people, the Burgesses and Monroes, lost significant amounts of land. Today, their relatives are demanding restitution from the California Reparations Task Force, which was established by Governor Gavin Newsom , in 2020, after the murder of George Floyd , to study racial injustice. On May 6th, the task force voted to formally recommend a large set of proposals to the California state legislature-which will soon have to make a decision regarding reparations.\n\nJonathan Burgess, a fire-battalion chief from Sacramento and a descendant of the Burgess family, has become a well-known advocate for reparations. He and Dawn Basciano, whose great-grandmother was Pearley Monroe's wife, showed me around the state park one afternoon last fall. They contend that their families were underpaid in the forced sales, and that more land has been lost through faulty record-keeping-and they want more recognition of the gold rush's rich, and largely ignored, Black history. \" Our history,\" Burgess said. \"I like to say 'our' history because we're all Americans.\"\n\nBurgess and Basciano described the arrival of their ancestors in California as they led me through the park's green lawns and reconstructed workers' shacks. According to family lore and historical records, which often ignored or omitted Black Americans, one of Burgess's forebears-Rufus Burgess-was brought to the Coloma area in 1850 as an enslaved person, probably with an owner who travelled by ship from New Orleans to San Francisco.\n\nEither way, those two years of slavery for Rufus Burgess were illegal, because, in 1850, California established itself as a free state. The gold rush, though, continued to draw plenty of fortune-seeking slaveowners who brought enslaved people with them to the rivers and mountains around Sacramento. Law enforcement was slack. \"Hundreds arrived before the state's constitutional ban on slavery went into effect in 1850, but many others came after,\" the historian Kevin Waite, author of \" West of Slavery ,\" has written. \"California . . . was a free state in name only.\"\n\nOnce freed, Rufus worked on local farms as a homesteader and started a successful blacksmith's shop on the site of what's now the Coloma Lotus Community Center. By the eighteen-seventies, he had purchased property of his own. He built a family home and was granted a deed to the African Church of Coloma. After the El Dorado County seat moved, in 1857, from Coloma to Placerville, about nine miles away, and took some white families with it, the town's nonwhite population grew steadily more powerful. \"The town was left to the Negroes and the Chinese,\" Jonathan Burgess told me. (Some Coloma residents dispute this claim, noting that several white families also remained in town.)\n\nWhen we arrived at a spot in the park where state officials had built a wooden replica of Sutter's Mill, Burgess seemed unimpressed. \"So this is the sawmill,\" he said, in a flat voice. \"There's a picture of my Uncle Marion down there,\" Burgess added, motioning into the distance. \"They credit my Uncle Marion, working with the Gallaghers and some other prominent families, and they said he dug his shovel down and hit the foundation of the sawmill. It's a great story, right?\"\n\nBurgess doesn't believe it. He doubts many of the state's official gold-rush accounts, including the traditional location of Sutter's Mill. Citing the curve of the river and the strength of the current, he believes the mill stood about two hundred yards upriver from where state officials say, behind the community hall on the site of Rufus Burgess, Sr.,'s blacksmith shop. If that was where Sutter's Mill was really situated-instead of the long-recognized spot on Pearley Monroe's old land-it would strengthen Burgess's claim that his family owned far more property in the eighteen-hundreds than the ten acres that the state claims they did.\n\nBut state officials backed up their assessment of the mill's location. Standing by California's replica of Sutter's Mill, Steve Hilton, a cultural-resources supervisor at the state park, later told me the official location is correct. He also showed me a nearby spot in the American River where, he said, a few timbers of the old mill sometimes resurface.\n\nOne reason for the confusing historical record is that California was a northern province of Mexico when Marshall found gold in 1848. Days after Marshall's find, the United States and Mexico signed a treaty that ended President James Polk's expansionist war with Mexico, and that granted a huge swath of territory, including California and much of the American West, to the United States. Soon after, the gold rush started in earnest. Prospectors dismantled Sutter's sawmill for scrap lumber. Marshall, despite his discovery, was out of a job. And the village of Coloma became a wild and dangerous frontier town, full of claim lawyers, gamblers, saloon owners, and other threats to a lucky miner's wealth.\n\nJonathan Burgess has written a children's book about the land controversies in Coloma that contains his corrections to the official state history, as well as what he admits are his own fictionalizations about Rufus. He and the state agree that the Burgess and Monroe families cultivated orchards on the riverside land in the late nineteenth century, but he feels the two Black families were shortchanged out of more than just their property when the state forcibly seized their land. \"If there's gold in the hills,\" Burgess said, \"there was gold beneath the orchards.\"\n\nThe Sacramento Bee , he pointed out, reported that several plots of land along the river were being sifted for gold by private dredging boats in the nineteen-thirties and forties. President Roosevelt had raised the price of gold to thirty-five dollars per ounce, up from about twenty. As a result, extracting small amounts of gold from rocks in the American River in Coloma was newly profitable. \"The General Dredging Co. is handling about 4800 cubic yards of material daily,\" reported the Los Angeles Times , in the summer of 1941. \"One dredge is working close to the lines of the Pearley Monroe property, where Marshall found gold in Sutter's millrace. The management of the company states that the historic site will not be disturbed.\"\n\nA local paper also noted that a dredging company had been trying to negotiate with Monroe to purchase his land when state officials began the process of seizing it through eminent domain. Burgess believes that timing was no coincidence, telling me, \"When Pearley refused to allow the dredgers to come and dredge, to get the remaining gold, eminent-domain proceedings happened shortly thereafter.\"\n\nFinally, Burgess cites an aerial photo from the late forties showing most of the plots around Pearley Monroe's land whitened by vast dredging trails. The photo, Burgess argues, proves that, five years after state officials forced Monroe to sell his land, boats had dredged both sides of the American River for gold tailings. He argues that the plots of land would be a source of generational wealth for his family if the state had not seized them.\n\nThe record-like everything else in this story-is complicated. Burgess has paperwork showing ownership dating back to some of Rufus's holdings in the eighteen-seventies. State records, though, show that the Burgess family possessed only ten acres of land in 1879. Burgess says those state documents are incomplete, citing fires that burned old census and property records. He finds it suspicious that the town's original 1873 property map, for example, has gone missing.\n\nToday, Jonathan Burgess and his twin brother Matthew spend most of their time in Sacramento, where they grew up. Both are media-savvy public figures: Matthew is an officer with the California Highway Patrol who ran for state senate, briefly, in 2022. The brothers used to own a food truck called Burgess Brothers Barbecue, and they've appeared on the Home Shopping Network to sell their B.B.Q. sauces and cornbread mix. In some ways, they are an American success story, but they also describe a deep sense of loss.\n\nJonathan and Matthew both remember driving down to Coloma on family trips and hearing about their ancestors and the land around Sutter's Mill. They also remember that, when they were kids-in the nineteen-seventies and eighties-there was a distinct lack of acknowledgment in the state park that Black families had existed, never mind thrived, in Coloma. Now several signs in the park show where the Monroes, Burgesses, and Gooches-another family descended from enslaved people-owned houses and land, most of which is now park property. Jonathan wants the unoccupied portion of his family's holdings back and turns up at every Reparations Task Force meeting in Sacramento.\n\nStories like the Burgess family's have received significantly more political and media attention since Governor Newsom created the Reparations Task Force three years ago. Reparations could mean anything from subsidized mortgages and tuition credits to direct payments to the descendants of enslaved people. Steven Bradford, a state senator who sits on the task force, and who is Black, told me that eminent domain has been used as a blunt tool for changing the racial makeup of neighborhoods throughout California's history. \"It's very few examples in the last hundred years where a park, a freeway, a road, or anything went through a white neighborhood,\" he said.\n\nThe Burgess brothers and Basciano have also been encouraged by the precedent-setting case of Bruce's Beach , in the city of Manhattan Beach, in which a clearly racist act of eminent domain was reversed two years ago by the County of Los Angeles and Governor Newsom. There, a Black family running a resort in the nineteen-twenties had its land and business ripped away by the white city officials, in a clear effort to change the racial makeup of the town.\n\nThe Coloma case is less straightforward. The Burgesses cannot produce a continuous paper trail connecting Jonathan's claim of massive Burgess landholdings in the eighteen-seventies to the nineteen-forties, when the eminent-domain proceedings began. \"Right now, there's no paperwork that has come up to show that we had more [land],\" Jonathan Burgess admitted. \"That is one-hundred-per-cent correct.\" Some of the dredged land in the aerial picture was owned by the Gallaghers, a local Irish American family. It's not obvious from the photo whether Pearley Monroe's land was dredged, and, given the limited historical record, it will be difficult to prove in court that dredging was the secret motive behind the state's eminent-domain land seizures.\n\nStill, Burgess has more old deeds than Black families tend to possess in California and across America. Burgess and Basciano can show direct lineage to people who should not have been enslaved in the first years of California's statehood, which means they should be eligible for general reparations under the task-force guidelines. But Burgess argues that he can also show proof of specific economic injustices. He believes the Monroes and Burgesses have enough deeds and other records to win direct restitution for property-similar to what was granted in the Manhattan Beach case. This outcome would entail a transfer of land from the park back to the families, or monetary compensation.\n\nThe Burgess case shows the immensity of the task facing California's state legislature. Should there be a minimum reparations payment to each Black family in California? Should some Black families in the state receive more than others? How long must a Black family have lived in California to be eligible?\n\nA recent, nonbinding report by state economists estimated it would cost eight hundred billion dollars-more than twice the state's current annual budget-to compensate Black residents \"for generations of over-policing, disproportionate incarceration and housing discrimination.\" But Steve Bradford, the state senator, said the focus should remain on the descendants of enslaved people. \"To conflate it with anyone else is not addressing the whole purpose of reparations,\" he told me. \"This was [for] folks who have direct lineage to chattel slavery here in the United States, brought to California, or folks who have been in California prior to 1900.\"\n\nThe task force will sift through all the paperwork and send a detailed report to the governor's office by July 1st. \"It's challenging,\" Bradford said. \"But we're making progress.\" Burgess, meanwhile, has warned that he might sue for direct return of the land, but hopes he won't have to do so. \"There's no reason to take a battle to court,\" he said. \"We know, unfortunately, our country's history, and California's history, which did not work towards the advantage of pioneer descendants of slaves.\" ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Race and Poverty, Fifty Years After the March\n\nWhen we talk about the historic civil-rights gathering whose fifty-year anniversary will be celebrated on Wednesday, we usually call it the March on Washington. In fact, the full name of the event was the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom; early in his speech, Martin Luther King, Jr., lamented that black Americans lived \"on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity.\" The marchers had ten demands for Congress, at least four of which were aimed at improving black people's financial circumstances and narrowing the gulf between black and white Americans' economic opportunities.\n\nFifty years later, that gulf hasn't changed much. By some measures it has widened. In 2011, the median income for black households was about fifty-nine per cent of the median income for white households, up slightly from fifty-five per cent in 1967, according to Census data analyzed by the Pew Research Center . But when you consider wealth -that is, everything a family owns, including a home and retirement savings-the difference seems to have grown. Pew found that the median black household had about seven per cent of the wealth of its white counterpart in 2011, down from nine per cent in 1984, when a Census survey first began tracking this sort of data.\n\nThe trend is unsettling-hard to believe, even-particularly given the progress black Americans have seen on some fronts. In a 1961 poll, forty-one per cent of respondents said they wouldn't vote for a \"generally well-qualified man\" from their party if he happened to be black; five years ago, Americans elected a black President. In 1964, white students graduated high school at almost double the rate of their black peers; today, graduation rates for blacks are only a couple of percentage points lower than for whites. Yet black Americans have moved ahead little-and by some measures have fallen behind-with regard to the one standard that matters most to Americans: making money. How did this happen? How do we fix it?\n\nBack in 1963, the Washington marchers made these four economic demands: a higher federal minimum wage, a law barring discrimination by employers, a massive job-training program, and an increase in the areas of employment covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938-the law that established standards such as overtime pay. The policy changes brought about by the protesters' demands, and the civil-rights movement at large, were significant, if not as numerous as King and his allies sought. In January of 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson launched the policies that became known as the War on Poverty; that July, Congress enacted the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Through the sixties and into the seventies, the government started job-training programs and deliberately hired more black people into government jobs, among other measures.\n\nAfrican-Americans increasingly found white-collar and skilled blue-collar work that provided decent wages-not only in northern cities like Baltimore and Detroit, which had drawn black workers earlier in the century, but also in the South. Black Americans seemed to be getting a foothold in the economy; by 1978, the black median income rose to fifty-eight per cent of the white median income, according to Pew.\n\nThen came the early nineteen-eighties, when corporations began going abroad for lower-cost labor and cutting domestic manufacturing jobs. That coincided, roughly, with a Reagan-era backlash against public spending that led to cuts in many of the earlier government programs. The gap between black and white incomes widened again. (The black-to-white income ratio would not surpass its 1978 high until the nineties.)\n\n\"The people who went to Baltimore, who went to Detroit, were the go-getters of the African-American community,\" Dedrick Muhammad, the senior director of the economic department of the N.A.A.C.P., told me. \"They were willing to work hard. These people, who have become demonized as the permanent underclass, became the permanent underclass when the jobs died.\"\n\nBecause of the dearth of pre-1984 wealth information, researchers have had a hard time studying the racial wealth gap in the years immediately after the civil-rights movement. They have, however, come to better understand what has happened over the past twenty-five years.\n\nWhen researchers compare today's situation with that of 1984, they find that a greater share of blacks than whites have ended up in low-paying service positions-for instance, assisting in nursing homes-that don't offer benefits that help compound people's wealth, such as retirement plans. Black families are less likely to receive inheritances; black students both graduate college at lower rates and are more likely to be saddled with college debt; and blacks are incarcerated at disproportionate rates, reducing their ability to earn good wages even when those who are imprisoned become free.\n\nBut the wealth gap mostly comes down to home ownership. Researchers at Brandeis University recently tracked the same group of black and white families from 1984 to 2009. During that period, a smaller proportion of black families bought homes, and those who did bought them later in life than their white peers-and that meant they benefited less as home values rose, according to Thomas Shapiro, a professor at Brandeis University. When one compares white families whose wealth grew over the years to black families whose wealth grew, Shapiro said, twenty-seven per cent of the disparity between the two groups is related to home ownership.\n\nWhich brings us back to the March on Washington. The marchers of 1963 sought policies that would help poor people generate wealth; back then, the government did that by helping people find good work and make decent wages, along with introducing anti-poverty programs that helped people pay for food and other essentials. Today, now that the wealth gap mostly has to do with investments-especially in housing-it would seem that the best policy solution would be to help people buy homes that they can afford and acquire other wealth-generating assets.\n\nInstead, the government's policies for poor people have emphasized consumption without also focussing on savings and investments, as the Urban Institute, a research organization, pointed out in an April report. For instance, the government helps people pay for food with the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Families can even lose certain benefits if they save too much.\n\nThe United States does have policies aimed at building wealth-but those policies happen to disproportionately help people who are already pretty rich. For instance, homeowners claim the mortgage-interest tax deduction only if they itemize their deductions, which higher-income taxpayers are likelier to do, and the deduction gets bigger when you have a larger mortgage or are in a higher tax bracket.\n\nThere are solutions. The government could, for instance, turn the deduction for homeowners into a flat amount-and one, Shapiro said, that could apply only to a first home and wouldn't require taxpayers to fill out an extra form. EARN , a San Francisco nonprofit, offers savings accounts in which the nonprofit adds two dollars or more for every dollar a person deposits. The government could emulate that approach to encourage people to save.\n\nFour years after the March on Washington, King became frustrated with the government's focus on the Vietnam War at the expense of the War on Poverty. He organized a kind of sequel to the 1963 march-this time called the Poor People's Campaign. \"We ought to come in mule carts, in old trucks, any kind of transportation people can get their hands on,\" he said. \"People ought to come to Washington, sit down if necessary in the middle of the street and say, 'We are here; we are poor; we don't have any money; you have made us this way ... and we've come to stay until you do something about it.' \" In April of 1968, King was assassinated. Given his concerns about the stagnation of the civil-rights movement soon after the March on Washington, it's hard to imagine that King would have been satisfied, had he lived, to discover that on the fiftieth anniversary of his speech, black Americans are still calling out from an island of poverty and going unheard.\n\nPhotograph by Bruce Davidson/Magnum.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "A Few Thoughts About British Actors Playing American (and African-American) Roles\n\nSamuel L. Jackson made the news for something other than his acting two weeks ago when, in a radio interview on Hot 97 , he talked about Jordan Peele's movie \"Get Out\" and its star, the British actor Daniel Kaluuya. \"I tend to wonder what would that movie have been with an American brother who really understands that, in a way, because Daniel grew up in a country where they've been interracial dating for, like, a hundred years,\" Jackson said. \"What would a brother from America have made of that role? I'm sure the director helped, but some things are universal, but everything ain't.\"\n\nJackson went on to mention Ava DuVernay's \"Selma\" and wondered how the role of Martin Luther King, Jr., might have been interpreted differently by an American actor rather than David Oyelowo, who grew up in England and Nigeria. \"There are some brothers from America who could have been in that movie,\" Jackson said. (I greatly admire \" Selma ,\" yet I, too, found Oyelowo's British mannerisms to affect the performance.) Asked why British black actors get so much work in Hollywood, he said, \"They're cheaper than us.\" After the ensuing laughter, he added, \"And they think they're better trained, for some reason, than we are, because they're classically trained.\" A few days later, Jackson clarified his remarks in an interview for Vanity Fair : \"Black Americans don't have the opportunity to go to the U.K. and see if they can adapt the British accent and work. They do restrict us in an interesting sort of way. We're not afforded that luxury. That's what I was trying to say.\"\n\nThere are a couple of distinct matters at stake in Jackson's remarks, though neither has much to do with \"Get Out,\" which Jackson said he hadn't seen. The first is a matter of fairness, the other a matter of movie art. These issues are both substantial; both have been in the air for a while, and Jackson's remarks merely crystallized them and brought them to the fore.\n\nIt seems obvious to nearly everyone today-as it didn't decades ago-that it's important for roles in movies to be played by actors whose ethnic background is close to that of the character, and all the more important when the characters in question are members of minority groups who have had their stories told on film (if at all) mainly by white filmmakers and their roles often interpreted by white actors. That's why Emma Stone, though one of the best young actors around, was utterly miscast as a part-Asian, part-Hawaiian woman in Cameron Crowe's \"Aloha.\" From the perspective of fairness, there are painfully few roles (and fewer substantial ones) in Hollywood movies that are written for actors other than white ones, so it's all the more offensive for a white actor to step into an Asian role. Moreover, Stone's miscasting didn't merely perpetuate the inequities of the business, it affected the movie's art as well-its tone, its mood, perhaps its substance, too.\n\nActors bring more than their technique and charisma to the screen-they bring their very life with them, their experience, and this is something that no amount of craft or charm can override. (Many of the greatest American movie actors-among the classics, John Wayne and Joan Crawford foremost-had little training in theatre and few self-transformative powers; on camera, they were always, unyieldingly, themselves.) Much of acting is unconscious and beyond actors' control-not merely accents or gestures but the subcutaneous, the fundamental matter of personal bearing, which develops in early life and is inseparable from upbringing, education, and mores. In that sense, the over-all question that Jackson poses-about the supposed differences between the training of American actors and British ones-gets to the heart of the cinema, to the difference between acting and being.\n\nThe fundamental question that Jackson doesn't address-but that his remarks imply-is whether the imaginative leap that it takes to do a part well contributes to or detracts from a performance. In other words, do actors' efforts to create characters strip away what's interesting about the actors themselves, as people rather than as bearers of skills? In the case of Kaluuya, the gap between the experience of being a black person in Great Britain and the United States is perhaps not as wide as Jackson assumes, which is something that Kaluuya addressed in a recent interview in GQ . \"The Brixton riots, the Tottenham riots, the 2011 riots, because black people were being killed by police,\" he said. \"That's what's happening in London.\" When it comes to the experience of racial minorities, appearance is, to a significant extent, experience; a Klan member or a racist police officer won't ask a black person for a passport-any more than for a diploma or a bank book-before launching an epithet or an attack. Kaluuya acknowledged as much in the same interview when he said, \"I resent that I have to prove that I'm black. . . . I see black people as one man. When I see people beaten on the streets of America, that hurts me. I feel that.\"\n\nApart from questions of the black experience, though, I think that the gap between British and American performers is shrinking-where British actors were once far more likely to have university or conservatory training, today many young American actors do as well. (The exceptions are often those, such as Kristen Stewart and Ryan Gosling, who were child stars, and those, such as Jonah Hill and Melissa McCarthy, who were comedians.) There are some recent movies in which the casting of a British-trained actor did the movie no good-for instance, Michael Fassbender as the title character in \"Steve Jobs\" and Ewan McGregor as Seymour (Swede) Levov in his own adaptation of Philip Roth's \"American Pastoral.\" As Jobs, Fassbender was too tight. Whether it was a matter of concentrating on the American accent, concentrating on the performance over all, or simply being a more temperamentally controlled person, Fassbender didn't bring the casualness, the loose mannerisms that Jobs brought to work and life along with his strong professional and intellectual focus. Similarly, McGregor, as the Swede, didn't stride freely, as Roth's character did, and turned him unduly taut and wary from the start. Were these shortcomings because of their personalities, as formed from childhood? Because of their effortful deployment of theatrical training in acting with American accents? In any case, they were the wrong actors for the roles.\n\nHere, too, the gap between Hollywood movies and independent productions is relevant. It's hard to imagine independent filmmakers-working on a modest budget, shooting on location with a small crew, perhaps filming stories from their own lives or families or home towns-bringing in actors to transform themselves with accents when the very essence of their work is to grow a film seemingly from the ground up. It doesn't mean that their actors aren't trained (though they're often likely to cast untrained actors, including themselves, alongside ones who have studied the craft). It means that, even with training, the force of the performances derives in large measure from their proximity to and connection with the actors' off-screen, real-life personality and experience. For instance, the godparents of the independent cinema, John Cassavetes and Gena Rowlands, both had solid professional training-and they made movies that nonetheless implicated them personally, and involved their personal lives onscreen, in ways that the Hollywood movies in which they appeared could never touch.\n\nNonetheless, even many independent films depend on more than emotional and practical connection to the actors' and filmmakers' lives-they also involve cinematic artifice, whether conspicuous or camouflaged. One of the greatest performances of last year was given by Naomie Harris in Barry Jenkins's texturally and dramatically realistic \"Moonlight,\" which was filmed on location in the predominantly African-American Miami neighborhood of Liberty City, where Jenkins grew up. The movie's most conspicuous elements of artifice are its leaps of a decade between its three sections; Harris's role, as the mother of Chiron, the protagonist, is the only one that appeared in all three sections and required the theatrical transformation of aging decades onscreen. Harris is also the only British actor among the film's leads, a fact that detracted from her performance not at all.\n\nIf there is such a thing as national characteristics-in effect, habits of mind and manner that are shaped by a country's educational system and customs and mores-they're in no way predictive or prescriptive. They're tendencies, and it makes less and less sense to consider them narrowly given the frequency and prevalence of migration. As tendencies, they too easily veer toward caricature, cliché, and stereotype, which is why they ought to be of little artistic use-except in self-critical, self-deprecating, or self-parodying work. What's more, the diversity of countries' populations also makes the narrowing view of a single national way of being all the more absurd. Where communities were formerly insular, now they flow together. Just as burritos, pizza, bagels, and tofu can be found pretty much anywhere now, as can hip-hop and country music, so the accents and gestures, the bearing-repertory and personal styles of American life (and, for that matter, life in many European countries) have changed and widened. (The rejection of that broadened and ever-expanding notion of national culture is the essence of the resurgence of far-right white nationalism.)\n\nThe recognition of the distinctiveness of individual experiences-and of the experiences of members of particular cultures within a country at large-is democracy at work, both politically and artistically. Jackson's remarks are all the more worth considering because the distinctiveness of historical consciousness is the very subject of  \"Get Out.\" I think that there are good reasons for the casting of Kaluuya in the lead role, starting with considerations akin to those of \"Moonlight.\" \"Get Out\" isn't exactly a horror film, but what it borrows from the genre is, above all, an element of symbolic abstraction. The movie's protagonist, Chris, a photographer, has a somewhat distracted, idealized yet tense air, especially as compared to his best friend, Rod (Lil Rel Howery), a T.S.A. agent who's much more practical, streetwise, and freewheeling. When I saw the movie, I had no idea that Kaluuya is British; if there's a subliminal or subtle tension to his performance, it's just right for the drama. I think that Peele, whose directorial début with \"Get Out\" is among the most notable of recent years, knew exactly what he was doing when he cast Kaluuya in the role.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "The Black Families Seeking Reparations in California's Gold Country\n\nDuring the final years of the Great Depression, officials in California set out to build a state park to commemorate the centennial of the discovery of gold in 1848, an event that set off the largest mass migration in U.S. history and transformed the American West. They offered to buy plots of land from a dozen local families and businesses in Coloma, in the Sacramento Valley; this was where John Marshall, nearly a hundred years earlier, had famously found gold. He discovered the precious metal in rocks near a sawmill he was building for John Sutter-a Swiss German businessman and early settler of California-on the banks of the American River. Hundreds of thousands of people from around the world swarmed the Pacific Coast to mine for gold, sparking a vast economic boom.\n\nOne of the local landowners was Pearley Monroe, who worked as a janitor in California's State Capitol building, about fifty miles away. In the late nineteen-thirties, state officials offered Monroe twenty-five hundred dollars for \"the place of shifting gravel and flowing water where Sutter's Mill once stood,\" as a local paper put it. By the nineteen-thirties, Coloma had become a faded, rural town, with few economic prospects.\n\nA Black descendant of enslaved Americans brought to California during the gold rush, Monroe was proud of the family's land holdings. He declined the offer, hoping for a higher price. Monroe's grandparents had eventually settled as free citizens in Coloma, where they raised kids and fruit orchards and became prominent, suit-wearing members of the community. Monroe inherited his part of the Sutter's Mill property and bought the rest \"on speculation,\" according to a news report.\n\nAfter the state made its offer, Monroe, who had also spurned offers from gold-dredging companies and a local historical group, set his price at ten thousand dollars. By 1941, he had become known in the papers for his stubbornness. \"I would rather see the land turned into a park and swimming pool for my people,\" he told the Los Angeles Times . That same year, California's attorney general, Earl Warren-who would later become a famed Supreme Court Chief Justice-moved to condemn the property owned by Monroe and other local families under eminent domain. In 1942, a county judge fixed the government's price for Monroe's land at just over three thousand dollars, and forced him to sell.\n\nOfficials compelled a dozen or so other local families to sell their holdings as well, and established the Marshall Gold Discovery State Historic Park, just in time for the centennial, in 1948. The property seizures affected some Asian and white families. But two large Black families descended from enslaved people, the Burgesses and Monroes, lost significant amounts of land. Today, their relatives are demanding restitution from the California Reparations Task Force, which was established by Governor Gavin Newsom , in 2020, after the murder of George Floyd , to study racial injustice. On May 6th, the task force voted to formally recommend a large set of proposals to the California state legislature-which will soon have to make a decision regarding reparations.\n\nJonathan Burgess, a fire-battalion chief from Sacramento and a descendant of the Burgess family, has become a well-known advocate for reparations. He and Dawn Basciano, whose great-grandmother was Pearley Monroe's wife, showed me around the state park one afternoon last fall. They contend that their families were underpaid in the forced sales, and that more land has been lost through faulty record-keeping-and they want more recognition of the gold rush's rich, and largely ignored, Black history. \" Our history,\" Burgess said. \"I like to say 'our' history because we're all Americans.\"\n\nBurgess and Basciano described the arrival of their ancestors in California as they led me through the park's green lawns and reconstructed workers' shacks. According to family lore and historical records, which often ignored or omitted Black Americans, one of Burgess's forebears-Rufus Burgess-was brought to the Coloma area in 1850 as an enslaved person, probably with an owner who travelled by ship from New Orleans to San Francisco.\n\nEither way, those two years of slavery for Rufus Burgess were illegal, because, in 1850, California established itself as a free state. The gold rush, though, continued to draw plenty of fortune-seeking slaveowners who brought enslaved people with them to the rivers and mountains around Sacramento. Law enforcement was slack. \"Hundreds arrived before the state's constitutional ban on slavery went into effect in 1850, but many others came after,\" the historian Kevin Waite, author of \" West of Slavery ,\" has written. \"California . . . was a free state in name only.\"\n\nOnce freed, Rufus worked on local farms as a homesteader and started a successful blacksmith's shop on the site of what's now the Coloma Lotus Community Center. By the eighteen-seventies, he had purchased property of his own. He built a family home and was granted a deed to the African Church of Coloma. After the El Dorado County seat moved, in 1857, from Coloma to Placerville, about nine miles away, and took some white families with it, the town's nonwhite population grew steadily more powerful. \"The town was left to the Negroes and the Chinese,\" Jonathan Burgess told me. (Some Coloma residents dispute this claim, noting that several white families also remained in town.)\n\nWhen we arrived at a spot in the park where state officials had built a wooden replica of Sutter's Mill, Burgess seemed unimpressed. \"So this is the sawmill,\" he said, in a flat voice. \"There's a picture of my Uncle Marion down there,\" Burgess added, motioning into the distance. \"They credit my Uncle Marion, working with the Gallaghers and some other prominent families, and they said he dug his shovel down and hit the foundation of the sawmill. It's a great story, right?\"\n\nBurgess doesn't believe it. He doubts many of the state's official gold-rush accounts, including the traditional location of Sutter's Mill. Citing the curve of the river and the strength of the current, he believes the mill stood about two hundred yards upriver from where state officials say, behind the community hall on the site of Rufus Burgess, Sr.,'s blacksmith shop. If that was where Sutter's Mill was really situated-instead of the long-recognized spot on Pearley Monroe's old land-it would strengthen Burgess's claim that his family owned far more property in the eighteen-hundreds than the ten acres that the state claims they did.\n\nBut state officials backed up their assessment of the mill's location. Standing by California's replica of Sutter's Mill, Steve Hilton, a cultural-resources supervisor at the state park, later told me the official location is correct. He also showed me a nearby spot in the American River where, he said, a few timbers of the old mill sometimes resurface.\n\nOne reason for the confusing historical record is that California was a northern province of Mexico when Marshall found gold in 1848. Days after Marshall's find, the United States and Mexico signed a treaty that ended President James Polk's expansionist war with Mexico, and that granted a huge swath of territory, including California and much of the American West, to the United States. Soon after, the gold rush started in earnest. Prospectors dismantled Sutter's sawmill for scrap lumber. Marshall, despite his discovery, was out of a job. And the village of Coloma became a wild and dangerous frontier town, full of claim lawyers, gamblers, saloon owners, and other threats to a lucky miner's wealth.\n\nJonathan Burgess has written a children's book about the land controversies in Coloma that contains his corrections to the official state history, as well as what he admits are his own fictionalizations about Rufus. He and the state agree that the Burgess and Monroe families cultivated orchards on the riverside land in the late nineteenth century, but he feels the two Black families were shortchanged out of more than just their property when the state forcibly seized their land. \"If there's gold in the hills,\" Burgess said, \"there was gold beneath the orchards.\"\n\nThe Sacramento Bee , he pointed out, reported that several plots of land along the river were being sifted for gold by private dredging boats in the nineteen-thirties and forties. President Roosevelt had raised the price of gold to thirty-five dollars per ounce, up from about twenty. As a result, extracting small amounts of gold from rocks in the American River in Coloma was newly profitable. \"The General Dredging Co. is handling about 4800 cubic yards of material daily,\" reported the Los Angeles Times , in the summer of 1941. \"One dredge is working close to the lines of the Pearley Monroe property, where Marshall found gold in Sutter's millrace. The management of the company states that the historic site will not be disturbed.\"\n\nA local paper also noted that a dredging company had been trying to negotiate with Monroe to purchase his land when state officials began the process of seizing it through eminent domain. Burgess believes that timing was no coincidence, telling me, \"When Pearley refused to allow the dredgers to come and dredge, to get the remaining gold, eminent-domain proceedings happened shortly thereafter.\"\n\nFinally, Burgess cites an aerial photo from the late forties showing most of the plots around Pearley Monroe's land whitened by vast dredging trails. The photo, Burgess argues, proves that, five years after state officials forced Monroe to sell his land, boats had dredged both sides of the American River for gold tailings. He argues that the plots of land would be a source of generational wealth for his family if the state had not seized them.\n\nThe record-like everything else in this story-is complicated. Burgess has paperwork showing ownership dating back to some of Rufus's holdings in the eighteen-seventies. State records, though, show that the Burgess family possessed only ten acres of land in 1879. Burgess says those state documents are incomplete, citing fires that burned old census and property records. He finds it suspicious that the town's original 1873 property map, for example, has gone missing.\n\nToday, Jonathan Burgess and his twin brother Matthew spend most of their time in Sacramento, where they grew up. Both are media-savvy public figures: Matthew is an officer with the California Highway Patrol who ran for state senate, briefly, in 2022. The brothers used to own a food truck called Burgess Brothers Barbecue, and they've appeared on the Home Shopping Network to sell their B.B.Q. sauces and cornbread mix. In some ways, they are an American success story, but they also describe a deep sense of loss.\n\nJonathan and Matthew both remember driving down to Coloma on family trips and hearing about their ancestors and the land around Sutter's Mill. They also remember that, when they were kids-in the nineteen-seventies and eighties-there was a distinct lack of acknowledgment in the state park that Black families had existed, never mind thrived, in Coloma. Now several signs in the park show where the Monroes, Burgesses, and Gooches-another family descended from enslaved people-owned houses and land, most of which is now park property. Jonathan wants the unoccupied portion of his family's holdings back and turns up at every Reparations Task Force meeting in Sacramento.\n\nStories like the Burgess family's have received significantly more political and media attention since Governor Newsom created the Reparations Task Force three years ago. Reparations could mean anything from subsidized mortgages and tuition credits to direct payments to the descendants of enslaved people. Steven Bradford, a state senator who sits on the task force, and who is Black, told me that eminent domain has been used as a blunt tool for changing the racial makeup of neighborhoods throughout California's history. \"It's very few examples in the last hundred years where a park, a freeway, a road, or anything went through a white neighborhood,\" he said.\n\nThe Burgess brothers and Basciano have also been encouraged by the precedent-setting case of Bruce's Beach , in the city of Manhattan Beach, in which a clearly racist act of eminent domain was reversed two years ago by the County of Los Angeles and Governor Newsom. There, a Black family running a resort in the nineteen-twenties had its land and business ripped away by the white city officials, in a clear effort to change the racial makeup of the town.\n\nThe Coloma case is less straightforward. The Burgesses cannot produce a continuous paper trail connecting Jonathan's claim of massive Burgess landholdings in the eighteen-seventies to the nineteen-forties, when the eminent-domain proceedings began. \"Right now, there's no paperwork that has come up to show that we had more [land],\" Jonathan Burgess admitted. \"That is one-hundred-per-cent correct.\" Some of the dredged land in the aerial picture was owned by the Gallaghers, a local Irish American family. It's not obvious from the photo whether Pearley Monroe's land was dredged, and, given the limited historical record, it will be difficult to prove in court that dredging was the secret motive behind the state's eminent-domain land seizures.\n\nStill, Burgess has more old deeds than Black families tend to possess in California and across America. Burgess and Basciano can show direct lineage to people who should not have been enslaved in the first years of California's statehood, which means they should be eligible for general reparations under the task-force guidelines. But Burgess argues that he can also show proof of specific economic injustices. He believes the Monroes and Burgesses have enough deeds and other records to win direct restitution for property-similar to what was granted in the Manhattan Beach case. This outcome would entail a transfer of land from the park back to the families, or monetary compensation.\n\nThe Burgess case shows the immensity of the task facing California's state legislature. Should there be a minimum reparations payment to each Black family in California? Should some Black families in the state receive more than others? How long must a Black family have lived in California to be eligible?\n\nA recent, nonbinding report by state economists estimated it would cost eight hundred billion dollars-more than twice the state's current annual budget-to compensate Black residents \"for generations of over-policing, disproportionate incarceration and housing discrimination.\" But Steve Bradford, the state senator, said the focus should remain on the descendants of enslaved people. \"To conflate it with anyone else is not addressing the whole purpose of reparations,\" he told me. \"This was [for] folks who have direct lineage to chattel slavery here in the United States, brought to California, or folks who have been in California prior to 1900.\"\n\nThe task force will sift through all the paperwork and send a detailed report to the governor's office by July 1st. \"It's challenging,\" Bradford said. \"But we're making progress.\" Burgess, meanwhile, has warned that he might sue for direct return of the land, but hopes he won't have to do so. \"There's no reason to take a battle to court,\" he said. \"We know, unfortunately, our country's history, and California's history, which did not work towards the advantage of pioneer descendants of slaves.\" ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "The Rise of Black Homeschooling\n\nWhen Victoria Bradley was in fifth grade, she started asking her mother, Bernita, to homeschool her. Bernita wasn't sure where the idea came from-they never saw homeschooling on TV. But something always seemed to be going wrong at school for Victoria. In second grade, a teacher lost track of her during parent pickup, and she wandered off school grounds. Bernita went to see the principal, intent on getting the teacher fired. The principal asked if she would consider taking an AmeriCorps position at the school. Bernita cut back her hours at the hair salon she owned and started doing community outreach, assisting teachers and hosting parent meetings.\n\nIn 2011, Bernita moved her family-which also included her older son, Carlos-to Detroit 's East English neighborhood, where she bought a three-story, yellow brick house for twelve thousand dollars. Victoria, then in fourth grade, transferred to Brenda Scott Academy, where two girls began bullying her. One wrote \"I'm fat\" in black pen on the back of Victoria's shirt. On another occasion, one of the girls spit at Victoria. She screamed at them, and was suspended. (That year, administrators suspended three hundred and forty Black students, or forty-two per cent of the school's Black population, and another sixteen Black girls were arrested there.)\n\nVictoria moved to a top-rated charter school, where she lasted only a few months-she said that an administrator picked on certain Black students. By fifth grade, Victoria had attended five schools, and she was tired of being the new kid. She brought up homeschooling when she was reprimanded for having blue braids, and again in eighth grade, after some boys dared each other to try picking her up as she sat at her desk. Homeschooling, she said, would allow her to learn at her own pace, without anyone making fun of her. Bernita was sympathetic, but she told Victoria that she couldn't teach her. She was a single mom, and she'd never completed her college degree.\n\nFor high school, Victoria enrolled in a majority-white charter school. Before the coronavirus pandemic shuttered Detroit's school system, which serves about fifty-three thousand children, she had failed chemistry and barely passed algebra. Soon after school went remote, in March, 2020, Victoria asked Bernita if she could drop out and take a job doing nails.\n\nDuring the first months of lockdown, Bernita, who works as an educational consultant, spent hours each day talking to other parents of students in the Detroit system on Zoom and Facebook. One mother told her that she had shut herself in the bathroom to cry after overhearing teachers berate her children on Microsoft Teams. Others told Bernita they'd only just discovered that their kids had been performing below grade level. (Before the pandemic, six per cent of Detroit's fourth graders met proficiency benchmarks in math, and seven per cent in reading, according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress.)\n\nEarly one evening last July, before Victoria's senior year, Bernita and Victoria pulled into their driveway and found that a container of dish soap they'd bought at Sam's Club had spilled in the trunk. While Bernita bailed out the soap using a three-ring binder and some old rags, Victoria looked down the cracked driveway and pointed at a swarm of fireflies. \"What makes them glow?\" she asked.\n\nBernita watched Victoria chase the fireflies around the yard for a few minutes. This, she thought, was what a Black kid's life should feel like-happy and unencumbered. She told Victoria to find a Mason jar. They ran through the grass until Victoria had trapped a single glowing insect. Afterward, they sat on their stoop, researching the specimen on Victoria's phone. They learned that the bugs belong to the family Lampyridae, and that a bioluminescent enzyme makes them glow.\n\nAs Victoria scrolled, Bernita laughed. \"You do know this is homeschooling, right?\" she asked.\n\nVictoria looked up from her phone. The fireflies lit up around them. \"Really?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yep,\" Bernita said. \"This is homeschooling. This is science. We about to do this for real.\"\n\nBlack families have only recently turned to homeschooling in significant numbers. The Census Bureau found that, by October, 2020, the nationwide proportion of homeschoolers-parents who had withdrawn their children from public or private schools and taken full control of their education-had risen to more than eleven per cent, from five per cent at the start of the pandemic . For Black families, the growth has been sharper. Around three per cent of Black students were homeschooled before the pandemic; by October, the number had risen to sixteen per cent.\n\nFew researchers have studied Black homeschoolers, but in 2009 Cheryl Fields-Smith, an associate professor at the University of Georgia's Mary Frances Early College of Education, published a study of two dozen such families in and around Atlanta. Some parents were middle class or wealthy, and wanted more challenging curricula for their children. Others hadn't attended college and earned less than fifteen thousand dollars a year; one family lived in a housing project.\n\nMost of the parents told Fields-Smith that the decision had been wrenching. Winning access to public education was one of the central victories of the civil-rights movement. Several parents had relatives who saw homeschooling as \"a slap in the face\" to the legacy of Brown v. Board of Education. Others worried about harming their neighbors' children, because public schools rely on per-pupil funding from state governments. (In 2020, around seventy per cent of Detroit public-school revenues came from per-student allocations by the state.)\n\nStill, the parents said that they felt as if they'd had no choice, with eighty per cent citing pervasive racism and inequities. Even in the wealthy families, parents said that their kids were frequently punished or seen as troublemakers. In some cases, students had been inappropriately recommended for special-education classes or medication; other students were bullied. In a study conducted in 2010 by professors from Temple University and Montgomery County Community College, homeschooling parents said that they thought Black Americans had been tricked into fighting for integration. \"Somebody put in our heads that being around your own kind was the worst thing in the world. How you need to be in better neighborhoods, in neighborhoods where people don't want you, in schools where people don't want to teach you,\" a mother in Virginia, who was homeschooling two children, said.\n\nBernita and Victoria first encountered a Black homeschooling family in 2015, when Victoria was in seventh grade and attending an after-school music class with a girl named Zwena Gray. Zwena's mother, Kija, had worked for many years as a substitute teacher in the University Prep School charter system. Most schools, in her view, prioritize whiteness-the kids are taught about white politicians and white inventors, and teachers and Black children are pushed toward compliance rather than creativity. Kija's son, Kafele, was frequently bullied. When he was in eighth grade, administrators at the charter school he was attending threatened to suspend him for not tucking in his shirt. Kija decided to homeschool him, and later Zwena, who was then in fifth grade. The children enrolled in online courses; Kija spent less time substitute teaching, and her husband, who works for the Detroit Health Department, also helped. Kafele returned to the charter school in eleventh grade, but Zwena never went back to school.\n\nWhen we talked in her dining room, Kija was baking cinnamon pound cakes to sell. As she described her journey from charter-school teacher to homeschool enthusiast, she drew a Biblical parallel: \"Satan was the closest thing to God, and he saw this shit for what it was, and he was, like, 'Oh, hell no.' He started to question things, and that's what made him cast out, because he didn't have blind faith-he had critical faith.\"\n\nBernita was astonished by what Kija had achieved with her children. Zwena had built robots, written code for Web sites, and designed her own clothes. But Kija had a bachelor's degree and a background in teaching. Bernita still couldn't see homeschooling as an option for Victoria.\n\nIn early 2020, an online acquaintance of Bernita's, Keri Rodrigues, a former labor organizer in Massachusetts and the president of a new organization called the National Parents Union, persuaded her to begin hosting a weekly forum for parents on Facebook Live. At the beginning of June, Bernita invited Kija on as a guest. It was a week after the police officer Derek Chauvin killed George Floyd in Minneapolis; thousands of people were protesting in downtown Detroit. The parents who spoke in the Facebook forum connected the uprising for racial justice with their experiences in the educational system. One mother said that she had tried many public and private schools; at all of them, the front office was filled with Black boys awaiting discipline.\n\nTesha Jordan, a single mother who works for Head Start, said that she'd been urged to transfer her son out of his middle school after his behavioral issues had scared a teacher. Jordan's son has a learning disability, and she worried that if she homeschooled him he would lose out-the state gave his middle school money for a social worker to help him with his homework twice a week. \"I'm not a teacher,\" Jordan said. \"I'm just a mother.\"\n\nKija, watching from her living room, unmuted herself. \"When I heard you say they had a behavioral problem-or you were told that-the thing that came to mind for me was, all Black people have a behavioral problem. It's called trauma,\" she said. \"And when you said, 'I'm not a teacher, I'm a mother'-those two things are synonymous.\"\n\nThe modern homeschooling movement in America was ignited in the nineteen-sixties, after Supreme Court decisions in 1962 and 1963 prohibited school prayer and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawed racial segregation in public institutions. Although homeschooling attracted some left-leaning hippies during the sixties and seventies, by the nineteen-eighties its most vocal and influential supporters were white Christian conservatives, according to Heath Brown, an associate professor of public policy at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and the author of the recent book \"Homeschooling the Right: How Conservative Education Activism Erodes the State.\"\n\nMost of the earliest homeschooling textbooks were written from a Christian perspective, and some were racist. Bob Jones University, the private South Carolina college that refused to admit Black students until 1971, began issuing homeschooling textbooks through its press later that decade. \"United States History for Christian Schools,\" first published in 1991, stated that most slaveholders treated enslaved people well, and that slavery \"is an excellent example of the far-reaching consequences of sin. The sin in this case was greed-greed on the part of African tribal leaders.\"\n\nArlin and Rebekah Horton, who met at Bob Jones University, went on to found what became Abeka, a Christian publisher that produces some of the country's most popular homeschooling materials. Abeka's \"America: Land I Love,\" for eighth graders, first published in 1996 and now in its third edition, argued that slavery allowed Black people to find Jesus. Abeka's eleventh-grade textbook \"United States History: Heritage of Freedom,\" first published in 1983 and now in its fourth edition, claimed that the Ku Klux Klan only occasionally resorted to violence. A 2018 investigation by the Orlando Sentinel found that Abeka was still producing textbooks stating that \"the slave who knew Christ had more freedom than a free person who did not know the Savior.\"\n\nEarly supporters of homeschooling wanted as little government intervention as possible and advocated against legislative proposals that would have sent money their way, Brown told me. \"It was a bargain they were unwilling to take,\" he said. \"In exchange for small amounts of funding, they would be subject to the things they fear most, which was having to adhere to a set of standardized educational schooling practices, on everything from teacher certification to testing to curricular choice.\"\n\nIn 1983, a group of white evangelical lawyers formed the Home School Legal Defense Association, to represent homeschooling parents who'd been arrested for not sending their children to school. When officers arrested two farmers in Michigan who'd been educating their children at home without a license, the H.S.L.D.A. spent nearly a decade fighting their case. In 1993, the state's Supreme Court ruled that homeschooling parents in Michigan did not need to be certified. (Michael Farris, the founding president of the H.S.L.D.A. and its board chairman, is now head of the conservative Christian nonprofit Alliance Defending Freedom, which in recent years has pushed for a series of anti-gay and anti-trans bills.)\n\nThe H.S.L.D.A. offers grants directly to coöperatives formed by homeschooling parents; after the number of homeschoolers spiked during the pandemic, it doubled its grant dollars for this year, to $1.3 million. As the number of Black and Latino homeschooling families has grown, the group has attempted to diversify its membership and staff. All but one of its lawyers are white, but it recently hired several Black and Latino consultants. LaNissir James, who has seven children, ranging in age from five to twenty-three, and who is based in Maryland but \"roadschools\" across multiple states in her R.V., started working as a high-school educational consultant for the H.S.L.D.A. in 2019. Families \"first need to understand the law,\" she said, because homeschooling regulations vary widely from state to state. Then James interviews parents to assess their children's academic needs. \"Are Mom and Dad working? Is Mom home? Do they want to be online? You find their strengths and weaknesses so that you can find a curriculum that matches that family.\"\n\nFor Black families like James's, the ability to improvise a curriculum is a major reason to try homeschooling. \"We are not seeing ourselves in textbooks,\" she said. \"I love traditional American history, but I like to take my kids to the Museum of African American History and Culture and say, O.K., here's what was going on with Black people in 1800.\" There are now hundreds of curricula to choose from, available on free or inexpensive Web sites such as Khan Academy and Outschool. Last year, one of the most popular offerings on Outschool was a course called Black History from a Decolonized Perspective, taught by Iman Alleyne, a former schoolteacher in Fort Lauderdale, who turned to homeschooling after her elementary-age son told her that school made him want to die.\n\nJames said that some of her Black clients need to know that homeschooling is something other Black families do. \"That's a normal feeling,\" she told me. \"And the answer is yes. There is joy for Black homeschoolers who find out about other Black homeschoolers.\"\n\nIn August, 2020, Bernita applied for and won a twenty-five-thousand-dollar grant from Keri Rodrigues's group, the National Parents Union, to fund a homeschooling collective called Engaged Detroit. She hired Kija and two other Black homeschooling mothers, at thirty-five dollars an hour, to coach a group of twelve parents, and used the remaining money to buy software, laptops, and other supplies.\n\nIn accepting the grant, Bernita became part of a decades-long political debate. The National Parents Union paid for the grant with money from Vela Education Fund, which is backed by the Walton Family Foundation and the Charles Koch Institute. These groups advocate \"school choice\"-rerouting money and families away from traditional public schools through such means as charter schools, which are publicly funded but privately managed, and vouchers, which allow public-education dollars to be put toward private-school tuition.\n\nSarah Reckhow, an associate professor of political science at Michigan State University and the author of \"Follow the Money: How Foundation Dollars Change Public School Politics,\" told me that the Waltons \"have been consistently a key funder of the charter-school movement.\" Since 1997, the Walton foundation has spent more than four hundred million dollars to create and expand charter schools nationwide. In 2016, it announced plans to spend an additional billion dollars on charters.\n\nSchool choice is an especially divisive subject in Michigan, where some of the country's first charter schools were established, in 1994. Betsy DeVos , of Michigan's billionaire Prince family, has invested millions, through donations and lobbying, to expand charters across the state. In 1999 and 2000, DeVos and her family backed an unsuccessful campaign, called Kids First! Yes!, to amend Michigan law to allow vouchers. In 2013, the Walton foundation doubled the budget of another DeVos project, the pro-voucher group Alliance for School Choice, when it announced a donation of six million dollars to send lower-income children to private schools. Three years later, DeVos published an op-ed in the Detroit News calling for the state to \"retire\" Detroit's public-school system: \"Rather than create a new traditional school district to replace the failed D.P.S.\"-Detroit Public Schools-\"we should liberate all students from this woefully under-performing district model and provide in its place a system of schools where performance and competition create high-quality opportunities for kids.\" DeVos's first budget proposal as Secretary of Education under President Trump, in 2017, would have cut nine billion dollars from federal education funding while adding more than a billion dollars for school-choice programs.\n\nAdvocates of school choice say that it gives low-income parents access to institutions that can better serve their children. Critics say that it lures highly motivated Black families away from traditional public schools and further hobbles underfunded districts. Presidents Clinton and Obama supported charters, but Democrats have largely cooled on them, and progressives such as Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have proposed curbing their growth. Michigan's charters, most of which operate as for-profit companies, have consistently performed worse than the state's traditional public schools. Yet parents continue to choose charters, which receive a large chunk of the more than eight thousand dollars per student that the state would otherwise send to non-charters, but aren't subject to the same degree of public oversight. About half of Detroit's students are now enrolled in charters, one of the highest proportions of any U.S. city.\n\nThe Walton foundation set up the National Parents Union in January, 2020, with Rodrigues as the founding president. Rodrigues's oldest son, who has autism and A.D.H.D., was suspended thirty-six times in kindergarten alone; sometimes he was sent to a sensory-deprivation room that Rodrigues thought resembled a cinder-block cell. Eventually, a school representative suggested a charter school. \"I didn't know what a charter school was,\" Rodrigues said. \"I didn't know I had any options. I just thought I had to send him to the closest school. I didn't know there were fights like this in education. All I knew was 'Oh, my god, are you kidding me-why are you doing this to my kid?' \"\n\nThe National Parents Union was less than three months old when the pandemic closed schools. As well-off families set up private learning pods, Vela Education Fund gave Rodrigues seven hundred thousand dollars to help people with fewer resources, like Bernita, create their own. \"There was an article in the New York Times about fancy white people in upstate New York creating these 'pandemic pods,' \" Rodrigues said. \"But that's how poor Black and brown folks survive in America-we resource-share. We don't call them 'pandemic pods,' because that's a bougie new term. For us, we called it 'going to Abuelita's house,' because she watched all the cousins in the family after school, and that's where you learned a host of skills outside of the normal school setting.\"\n\nLast summer, the nonprofit news organization Chalkbeat, which receives Walton funding, co-sponsored a virtual town hall on reopening Michigan's public schools. Detroit's superintendent, Nikolai P. Vitti, said that expanding to \"non-traditional\" options, such as learning pods, would hurt many of the city's children. He warned that homeschooling, like charter schools, would undermine public education and cost teachers their jobs. Legislators were already drafting bills, he said, to take money away from schools so that children could continue learning in pods after campuses reopened.\n\n\"I don't judge any parent for using the socioeconomic means that they have to create what they believe is the best educational opportunity for their child,\" Vitti said. \"We all do that, in our way, as parents. But that is the purpose of traditional public education, to try to be the equalizer, to try to create that equal opportunity.\"\n\nBernita had logged on to the discussion from her kitchen. \"Parents are not deciding to take their children out because of COVID ,\" she told Vitti. \"Parents are doing pods because education has failed children in this city forever.\"\n\nI asked Kija if it bothered her to accept money from the conservative-libertarian Koch family, who have spent vast sums of their fortune advocating for lower taxes, deep cuts to social services, and looser environmental regulations. \"I guess the bigger question is, why don't we have enough resources so that we don't have to get money from them? It bothers me, yes-but why do they have so much money that they get to fund all of our shit?\" she asked. \"I shouldn't have to get resources from the Kochs.\"\n\nKija and Bernita describe themselves as Democrats. Bernita said that, in another era, she \"would be a Black Panther with white friends.\" She said that she was \"at peace\" with her decision to take money from the Koch family, because they fund several of the charter schools that Victoria attended, through their Michigan-based building-supply company Guardian Industries. She is not a \"poster child\" for her conservative backers, she added-the Koch family has no control over what or how she teaches. In a video about Engaged Detroit produced by Vela Education Fund, Bernita states, \"If school won't reinvent education, we have to reinvent it ourselves, and our goal at Engaged Detroit is to make sure families have the tools so that choice is in their hands.\"\n\nVela Education Fund offered Bernita one year of funding, and in April she accepted another twenty-five-thousand-dollar grant, from Guardian Industries, to sustain her group through the next school year. Rodrigues imagines a scenario in which the per-pupil funding that public-school districts normally receive goes straight to a homeschooling parent. \"Instead,\" she said, \"you have systems that are addicted to that money.\"\n\nCeline Coggins, the executive director of Grantmakers for Education, a collective of more than three hundred philanthropic organizations, including the Walton Family Foundation, says it's not clear yet whether funders will continue to invest in homeschooling after the pandemic. Most are in \"listening mode,\" she said. Andre Perry, an education-policy expert at the centrist Brookings Institution, suspects that conservative-libertarian philanthropists will not prop up homeschooling as they have charters and vouchers, \"but they will use this wedge issue to hurt public schools,\" he said.\n\nPerry was once the C.E.O. of the Capital One New Beginnings Charter School Network, which launched in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, but he grew skeptical of the school-choice movement. Its funders tend to put their wealth toward alternatives to the public-school system, Perry told me, rather than lobbying state governments to implement more equitable funding models for public schools or to address the over-representation of Black children in special education. \"Because of the pandemic, you've had organizations saying, Hey, this is an opportunity to again go after public schools,\" Perry said. The Vela-funded homeschooling collectives don't address root causes of educational disparities, he continued: \"When people only focus on the escape hatch, it reveals they're not interested in improving public education.\"\n\nPerry went on, \"Slapping 'Parents Union' on something while you're constantly trying to underfund public education-that's not the kind of trade-off that suggests you're interested in empowering Black people. It's more of a sign that you're trying to advance a conservative agenda against public systems.\"\n\nSix months into the pandemic, a consensus had emerged that many children, in all kinds of learning environments, were depressed, disengaged, and lonely in the Zoom simulacrum of school. \"It's Time to Admit It: Remote Education Is a Failure,\" a headline stated in the Washington Post . \"Remote Learning Is a Bad Joke,\" The Atlantic declared. For some homeschoolers who rely heavily on online curricula, an all-screens, alone-in-a-room version of school can have a flattening effect even outside of a global health crisis. Kafele Gray, Kija's son, who is now twenty-one and studying music business at Durham College, in Ontario, liked online homeschooling because it freed him from bullying. After two years, though, he was failing his classes and procrastinating, with assignments piling up. \"It got kind of stressful,\" he said. \"You have to teach yourself and be on yourself.\" He especially struggled with math. \"When I'm in school, I'm better at math, because I have the teacher there to explain it to me-I'm seeing it broken down. When I was online, I would get it wrong, but I wouldn't know why.\" Still, when Kafele returned to his charter school, in eleventh grade, he'd learned to push himself to figure things out on his own. \"School was less challenging\" than it had been two years earlier, he told me. \"I started getting A's and B's again.\"\n\nWhen the fall semester started, Bernita and Victoria tried to replicate the course load Victoria would have undertaken in a normal year. Bernita searched for online chemistry and trigonometry classes, and Victoria decided to take dance at the charter high school she'd attended before the pandemic. Bernita wanted the Engaged Detroit families to learn about Black history, so she signed them up for a six-week virtual course with the Detroit historian Jamon Jordan. Victoria bought pink notebooks and pens and a chalkboard for writing out the weekly schedule, and Bernita set up a desk for her daughter in the den. Though Bernita spent many hours on Zoom for her consulting work, the family ate lunch together most days.\n\nAs the semester continued, Victoria faded. She stayed up until seven in the morning and slept until two every afternoon, and she stopped doing chemistry. In October, Bernita told her that she couldn't go on a planned post-pandemic trip to Los Angeles. Later that week, during her weekly coaching session with Kija, Bernita bragged about disciplining Victoria. Kija asked her to reconsider: teen-agers like sleeping in, and homeschooling allows kids to follow their natural rhythms. Besides, Kija said, Black kids are disciplined more than enough. Rather than punish Victoria, Kija suggested, Bernita should ask her daughter what she wanted to study.\n\nThe advice worked: Victoria replaced chemistry with a forensic-science class that met the state science requirements for graduation. She pored over lessons about evidence and crime scenes for hours at a time. By spring, she was waking up early to study for the core classes she needed to pass. One cold, sunny Wednesday, wearing a sweatshirt that read \"Look Momma I'm Soaring,\" Victoria sat down to puzzle out the trigonometry lessons that had always confused her. She emptied a pail of highlighters onto the table. At her high school, teachers hadn't let her write in different colors, and she couldn't make sense of her monochromatic notes. She opened a Khan Academy lesson on side ratios, and as the instructor explained the formulas for finding cosine and tangent Victoria drew triangles, highlighting each side with a different color.\n\nThe lesson included a nine-minute video and several practice questions. Every time Victoria attempted to find the cosine of the specified angle, she got the wrong answer. In a regular class, she would have pretended to understand. At home, she paused the video, rewound it, and flipped back through her notes. Eventually, she realized that she didn't know which side was the hypotenuse. She Googled the word.\n\n\"The longest side of a right triangle,\" she read. \"Oh.\"\n\nShe tried the formula for sine-opposite over hypotenuse-and this time a green check mark of victory flashed on her screen. Victoria solved for the angle's tangent, and when she got it right she smiled. \"O.K., I'm smart,\" she said.\n\nThe parents of Engaged Detroit meet on Zoom every other Monday night. One evening in mid-March, Bernita set her laptop on the kitchen table next to a plate of broccoli and mashed potatoes. A dozen squares popped up on her screen, showing kitchens and living rooms from across the city. The parents updated one another on their children's progress. Two preteens had started a jewelry-making business. An elementary-age boy with a stutter was relieved to be learning at home with his mom. Victoria watched for a minute, then went upstairs to feed her guinea pig, Giselle.\n\nA mother, Jeanetta Riley, recounted how, at the beginning of lockdown, she had discovered that her daughter, Skye, a freshman in high school, was performing two grades behind in math. After she joined Bernita's group, she found a tutor, and now, using Khan Academy, Skye had caught up to her grade level.\n\nLink copied\n\nLike Bernita, Jeanetta had thought of homeschooling as something only white people did. \"A lot of Black people are struggling,\" she told me. They don't have the resources to stay at home all day teaching. Before the pandemic, Jeanetta worked long hours in customer service at the Fiat Chrysler plant. The company laid her off in March, 2020, and she isn't sure when she'll return to work. Skye is old enough to stay home alone, though, and Jeanetta plans to continue homeschooling after the pandemic, a decision some of her family members do not support. One relative berated her at a party for thinking she could take charge of something others go to graduate school to master. But Jeanetta was enjoying her weekly coaching sessions with Kija, and Skye seemed happier.\n\n\"I see such growth in her,\" Jeanetta said. \"She's always painting stuff and bringing it to me. If that builds up her confidence, then I'm going for it. We didn't even know she could paint. We didn't know so much stuff about her. How is this my child, and I didn't know?\"\n\nThe day after the Engaged Detroit meeting, Victoria logged on to a dance class she was taking at the charter high school. Her teacher also joined from home, where she demonstrated the day's lesson under a framed poster of the Beatles. She was a white woman who often played white music in class, Victoria said-that Tuesday, she streamed an Adrianne Lenker song as the students stretched. Victoria preferred R. & B., but she felt close to her teacher, who often e-mailed her to check in. Other instructors had disappeared early in the pandemic.\n\nFor the class's final project, the teacher had encouraged the students to do something personal. Some choreographed a dance to music or to a poem. Victoria had written an original poem about being sexually abused as a child. Part of it read:\n\ntrauma can cause memory loss i physically remembered but consciously lost you're so shaken up thrown around and tossed it's up to you to ration the cost are you going to know who you are or cause family loss and you ask god to bring clarity on what you saw is this what defined who you are\n\nNear the end of that day's session, the teacher asked Victoria to stay online after class. When the other students had logged off, she told Victoria that she was worried about her poem. \"I don't want to censor anything,\" the teacher said. \"I just don't know from a school standpoint that we can share.\" The performances would be public, she said, for a \"family audience.\" She asked Victoria if she could revise the poem. \"Some of the lines are very, very vulgar,\" the teacher told her. (She was evidently referring to a stark couplet that switched the identity of \"you\" to disorienting effect: \"you touched me in a way i never knew was true / before you could make anyone else hard he got hard off of you.\") Victoria slumped a little in her chair, but she tried to keep smiling. \"O.K.,\" she said.\n\nA few nights later, Victoria opened an acceptance letter from Wayne State University. She'd won enough scholarship money to cover four years of tuition. With Pell Grant assistance, the amount came to more than thirteen thousand dollars a year. \"That's crazy,\" she whispered to herself. She carried the letter around the house the next morning; she paused her trigonometry lesson to reread it. On her lunch break, buzzing with triumph, Victoria called her dance teacher on Microsoft Teams. She asked if, instead of revising her poem, she could add a trigger warning. The teacher said again that parts of the poem were \"vulgar,\" then laughed-a high-pitched giggle. If Victoria wanted to perform it, the teacher would need to consult with the school's social worker: \"I feel like there's a fine line there, and I don't know what's acceptable for our audience.\"\n\nVictoria told her that she understood. She smiled, big and inviting, and she thanked her teacher for her time. \"I appreciate it that you're being understanding, that we're having a good conversation about this,\" the teacher said. \"Other people would get into this intense thing.\"\n\nBernita walked by and asked if she could speak to the teacher. Embarrassed, Victoria quickly closed her laptop.\n\n\"You just hung up on her,\" Bernita said. \"You know what I'm going to do is e-mail her, right?\"\n\n\"Mom,\" Victoria said firmly. Bernita stared back. Victoria bent over onto the table and buried her face in her arms. \"She's scared that [the teacher] is going to start acting funny with her,\" Bernita told me. \"That's what always happens when she addresses something. The teacher turns around and starts feeling some kind of way about her, so she don't want to address that, because she's, like, 'Just let me finish school.' \"\n\nShe turned back to Victoria, who was sobbing.\n\n\"Ain't that how you feeling?\"\n\nVictoria sat up to blow her nose, but cried harder. She nodded.\n\n\"People don't know the damage they do to kids,\" Bernita said. \"She's somewhere now thinking, 'Oh, that went well.' Baby, I'm going to e-mail her, O.K.?\"\n\nVictoria's tears dropped onto her acceptance letter, soaking it.\n\nBernita suggested that she put her emotions into something creative, so Victoria collected herself and went upstairs to her room, returning with green and yellow ribbons and a pair of white Nike Air Force Ones. She wouldn't have a normal high-school graduation. She wasn't even sure what her high-school diploma would say. \"Homeschool Academy\"? But she wanted to celebrate, so she'd started planning the outfit she'd wear when the semester ended. Wayne State's colors are green and gold.\n\nFor years, Victoria told people that she didn't plan to go to college, because she feared no college would accept her.

      "text": "The Politics of Black Aspiration\n\nAs wide-eyed Southern migrants stepped off trains in the big cities of the North a century ago, they were met by groups like the National Urban League, who presented them with care packages that often included basic items like soap and toiletries. This racial noblesse oblige was motivated by a sense of community responsibility, but also by the embarrassment that an upper tier of black America felt at the rough-hewn ways of their newly urban counterparts. The gifts were sometimes accompanied by handbills detailing the behavior expected of the new arrivals: admonitions against congregating on stoops, dressing inappropriately, wearing hair rollers in public, or raising chickens in the city. From the most cynical-and not entirely incorrect-perspective, the black struggle for civil rights in this country was driven by the desire of a fragile class of black strivers to distance themselves from the Negro non grata in a way that segregation made all but impossible.\n\nAt the turn of the twentieth century, W. E. B. Du Bois crusaded against the evils of segregation, one of which was the forced association of men of his standing with ruffians and undesirables. The sentiment was familiar to me long before I ever encountered his work, from my father's frequent admonishment: \"Never be common.\" This was told to me by a man with only three grades of formal education, the product of an overlooked outpost called Hazelhurst, Georgia, who had joined the Army and then made his way to Harlem in pursuit of better odds. The pervasive inequity, and nearly uniform poverty, of Jim Crow did not eliminate the capacity for class condescension among black people; it simply meant that \"class\" would be defined far more by behavior than by education or wealth.\n\nYears later, at the graduation where I received my doctorate, I gave my degree to my mother-a woman born in Bessemer, Alabama, who left the South at age fifteen for Chicago and finished high school there, but who, throughout her life, wielded her refined diction as a shield. Handing her the diploma was partly an act of filial deference, and mostly acknowledgement of an inside joke. The casual observer might see the arc of this family history-from an elementary school education to a Ph.D., in a single generation-as a metaphor for the successes of the civil-rights movement and a testament to the elastic potential of American democracy. But to my mother it had more to do with the guile of Brer Rabbit than the benevolence of Lyndon B. Johnson.\n\nOf late, we have begun to speak a great deal about black aspiration. Between the announcement, at the end of February, of Barack Obama's My Brother's Keeper initiative, and Paul Ryan's uncommonly blunt appraisal , last week, of \"inner-city\" men, poor black people find themselves, once again, part of a vexed dialogue about poverty, race, and government. \"Common,\" as my father used it, has become an obscure epithet, but for those curious about its meaning Ryan provided a serviceable definition:\n\nWe have got this tailspin of culture, in our inner cities in particular, of men not working and just generations of men not even thinking about working or learning the value and the culture of work, and so there is a real culture problem here that has to be dealt with.\n\nRyan's remarks soon gave way to the usual protestations of innocence: \"This has nothing to do whatsoever with race,\" he declared the next day. \"It never even occurred to me. This has nothing to do with race whatsoever.\" But this bit of theatre only obscured a more troubling issue, one that Ta-Nehisi Coates raised on the Web site of The Atlantic earlier this week. Ryan's indictment of \"inner-city\" laziness, with its obvious echoes of Ronald Reagan's \"Welfare Queen\" rhetoric, doesn't sound so different from Barack Obama's exhortations to African-American personal responsibility-which were on display in the White House at the end of last month, when the President launched his initiative to help young men of color. As Coates wrote:\n\nA number of liberals reacted harshly to Ryan. I'm not sure why. What Ryan said here is not very far from what Bill Cosby, Michael Nutter, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama said before him. The idea that poor people living in the inner city, and particularly black men, are \"not holding up their end of the deal\" as Cosby put it, is not terribly original or even, these days, right-wing. From the president on down there is an accepted belief in America-black and white-that African-American people, and African-American men, in particular, are lacking in the virtues in family, hard work, and citizenship.\n\nObama's frequent recourse to what is often called \"responsibility politics\" is not without its supporters: I made an oblique criticism of the program during a television appearance, and a small tide of black recrimination followed in response. On Thursday, Jonathan Chait, New York ' s politics writer, defended Obama against Coates's criticism, on the grounds that the President had a very different perspective from Paul Ryan, who believes that liberal public policies are responsible for the \"cycle of poverty.\" By contrast, Chait wrote, \"Obama's habit of speaking about this issue primarily to black audiences is Obama seizing upon his role as the most famous and admired African-American in the world to urge positive habits and behavior.\"\n\nTo the extent that Obama was speaking about the condition of young black men as a matter of American concern, Chait raises an important point. But on another level this is \"never be common\" all over again-this time, spoken with the moral authority of a man who, by virtue of his race and office, is the least common entity in the history of this nation. It has been Obama's consistent habit to douse moments of black achievement with soggy moralizing, whether at the commemoration of the 1963 March on Washington or during a commencement speech at Morehouse College.\n\nThose who defend Obama or excuse Ryan take recourse in the common-sense argument that such exhortations, even at their worst, do no harm. But this is to miss the point entirely: when the President, or any other leader, decides that black audiences need, more than anything else, to hear some variant on \"never be common,\" that decision confirms the long and ugly tradition that conflates blackness with laziness and poverty, and whiteness with virtue and wealth.\n\nConsider a rather more disturbing specimen of respectability politics: an essay by John Ridley , published by Esquire , in 2006, that attracted renewed attention earlier this month after Ridley won the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar for \"12 Years A Slave.\" If the title of Ridley's essay, \"The Manifesto of Ascendancy for the Modern American Nigger,\" doesn't adequately convey its contents, consider the opening paragraph:\n\nLet me tell you something about niggers, the oppressed minority within our minority. Always down. Always out. Always complaining that they can't catch a break. Notoriously poor about doing for themselves. Constantly in need of a leader but unable to follow in any direction that's navigated by hard work, self-reliance. And though they spliff and drink and procreate their way onto welfare doles and WIC lines, niggers will tell you their state of being is no fault of their own. They are not responsible for their nearly 5 percent incarceration rate and their 9.2 percent unemployment rate. Not responsible for the 11.8 percent rate at which they drop out of high school. For the 69.3 percent of births they create out of wedlock.\n\nSet aside the belief, naïve at best, that the word \"nigger\" is less contemptuous when uttered by another black person. These human epithets, Ridley asserts, should under no circumstances be conflated with black Americans-the respectable, striving citizens deserving of common decency. (Reading Ridley's essay, in fact, casts \"12 Years A Slave\" in a different light: for all its brilliance, the film is also the story of a virtuous black family man brought low by whites, who see no distinction between him and others of similar pigmentation.)\n\nIt would be tempting to single out Ridley for his inability to separate catharsis from analysis, were that confusion not so widespread. Years earlier, Chris Rock declared in a comedy routine that he loves black people but hates niggers. And, long before that, the unnamed protagonist of Ralph Ellison's \"Invisible Man\" was sent on his journey by accidentally exposing a rich white man to the type of unreconstructed Negro that black leaders had spent decades trying to wash, educate, or camouflage until better times were at hand. During the Great Migration, black newspapers featured letters from Northerners who resentfully inverted history, complaining that the migrants were \"bringing racism north with them.\" It was a logical fallacy that became a kind of conventional wisdom by the sheer frequency of its repetition.\n\nThe common ground here isn't so much between Ryan and Obama-it's between them and an entire skewed history of race in the country. Absent history, we overlook the fact that the \"inner-city,\" \"not working\" men who so trouble Ryan are the descendants of people who came to cities specifically in search of employment. You only have to skim a few pages of Isabel Wilkerson's magisterial history of the migration , \"The Warmth of Other Suns\"-or even watch a season of \"The Wire\"-to realize that, when we talk about the history of the American inner city, we're talking about what happened to those migrants, clutching their etiquette handbills and charity soap, in the weeks, months, and decades after they walked out of those train stations. In his piece, Chait acknowledges the racism that played an outsized role in shaping their fortunes:\n\nA person worries about the things that he can control. If I'm watching a basketball game in which the officials are systematically favoring one team over another ... the officiating bias may be my central concern. But if I'm coaching Team A, I'd tell my players to ignore the biased officiating. Indeed, I'd be concerned the bias would either discourage them or make them lash out, and would urge them to overcome it. That's not the same as denying bias. It's a sensible practice of encouraging people to concentrate on the things they can control.\n\nBut this is the kind of treacly liberalism best reserved for movies about dedicated white teachers who inspire their angry inner-city students-and it was precisely the myth that I meant to reject on the day of my graduation. A team on the receiving end of biased officiating loses more often, period. And, at some point, it quite reasonably begins to lose faith in the entire enterprise. To believe that my family history represents anything more than the confluence of hard work and an even greater degree of good luck would be to concede that a third-grade Jim Crow education represents a reasonable starting point from which to produce high-achieving children. And to do that would be to lend support, however unintentionally, to the belief that the implications of racism have been overstated.\n\nIt's not a coincidence that the history of black self-help has been so closely associated with many of the fiercest critics of the American social order. Discussions of race in America are mired in comparisons between blacks and other immigrant groups, but the dividing line is apparent: while the immigrant effort at self-improvement has often been rooted in a faith in American possibility, the ethic of black uplift was frequently entwined with its very opposite, an indictment of that possibility-or a loss of faith in its promise.\n\nIt's worth recalling that the poverty of which Ryan spoke both preceded and has outlived the liberal policies he derides. The black unemployment rate has been reliably half again as much as the white one. This gap was at its largest in 1989-at the end of eight years of Reaganomics-when the black figure was a hundred and seventy-six per cent of the white average. Even without the \"culture of poverty,\" black wages lag behind at nearly every level of educational attainment: the average lifetime earnings of a black person with a Master's degree are roughly equivalent to that of a white person with a Bachelor's. And yet the myth that education alone can be the great equalizer persists.\n\nTo his credit, Obama's My Brother's Keeper initiative offers more than a handbill with rules for good behavior. But both its scale and its intentions leave unsettling echoes. A century ago, the newly created National Urban League launched a program to identify ideal black job candidates and then work with industry to create a niche into which they could advance. It was a noble undertaking, but a hopelessly small one when pitted against the calcified will to maintain racial subordination.\n\nObama himself has become the greatest advertisement for black striving as well as its most dramatic indictment-an example of the widespread desire for African-American success, undercut by the blockaded frustrations of his Presidency. At the end of his press conference announcing the new initiative, Obama offered, as his parting statement, a vow that \"we will beat the odds.\" Coming from the most powerful black person in the history of this country, those words stung: trying to beat the odds is what you do when you've relinquished all hope of turning them in your favor.\n\nPhotograph by Kevin Lamarque/Reuters.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "The Unknown History of Black Uprisings\n\nSince the declaration of Martin Luther King, Jr.,'s birthday as a federal holiday, our country has celebrated the civil-rights movement, valorizing its tactics of nonviolence as part of our national narrative of progress toward a more perfect union. Yet we rarely ask about the short life span of those tactics. By 1964, nonviolence seemed to have run its course, as Harlem and Philadelphia ignited in flames to protest police brutality, poverty, and exclusion, in what were denounced as riots. Even larger and more destructive uprisings followed, in Los Angeles and Detroit, and, after the assassination of King, in 1968, across the country: a fiery tumult that came to be seen as emblematic of Black urban violence and poverty. The violent turn in Black protest was condemned in its own time and continues to be lamented as a tragic retreat from the noble objectives and demeanor of the church-based Southern movement.\n\nOn the fiftieth anniversary of the March on Washington, in August, 2013, then President Barack Obama crystallized this historical rendering when he said , \"And then, if we're honest with ourselves, we'll admit that, during the course of fifty years, there were times when some of us, claiming to push for change, lost our way. The anguish of assassinations set off self-defeating riots. Legitimate grievances against police brutality tipped into excuse-making for criminal behavior. Racial politics could cut both ways as the transformative message of unity and brotherhood was drowned out by the language of recrimination.\" That, Obama said, \"is how progress stalled. That's how hope was diverted. It's how our country remained divided.\"\n\nThis perception of riots as the decline of the nonviolent movement has marginalized the study of them within the field of history. As a result, our conventional wisdom about \"the riots\" of the sixties vastly underestimates the scale of Black insurgency and its political meaning. In her new book, \" America on Fire: The Untold History of Police Violence and Black Rebellion Since the 1960s ,\" the Yale historian Elizabeth Hinton recovers a much longer and more intense period of Black rebellion, which continued into the nineteen-seventies. In doing so, she challenges the dismissal of what she describes as the \"violent turn\" in Black protest, forging new ground in our understanding of the tactics employed by African-Americans in response to the extralegal violence of white police and residents and the unresolved issues of racial and economic inequality.\n\nUsing data compiled by the Senate Committee on Government Operations and the Lemberg Center for the Study of Violence, Hinton compiles a breathtaking list of more than a thousand uprisings, far beyond those with which we are most familiar. We have vastly underestimated the degree to which America was literally on fire from 1968 to 1972, years that Hinton compellingly describes as the \"crucible period of rebellion.\" Indeed, there were more than six hundred rebellions in 1970 alone. Hinton also makes the key finding that almost all of these rebellions came in response to escalating police interventions, intimidation, and harassment. She writes, \"The history of Black rebellion across regions and decades demonstrates a fundamental reality: police violence precipitates community violence.\"\n\nIn the summer of 1968, in Stockton, California, two police officers tried unsuccessfully to break up a party in a public-housing development. The situation quickly escalated when more than forty more white cops arrived, Hinton writes, turning the \"party into a protest.\" Police ordered the crowd to disperse; instead they pelted police with rocks and bottles. The police made some arrests, but they hardly restored order. The following day, two officers were dispatched to investigate reports of a disturbance at the gym in the housing development; residents locked the cops inside the gym, and, Hinton writes, for more than two hours, a crowd of two hundred and fifty people \"hurled firebombs, rocks, and bottles at the building screaming 'Pigs!' and other expletives.\" More than a hundred police, sheriff's deputies, and highway patrolmen arrived on the scene; the crowd released the two officers but continued to throw firebombs at the gymnasium, nearby cars, and even an elementary school. Many of them were teen-agers. Eventually, police called their parents, a strategy that worked as the kids finally went home.\n\nIn Akron, Ohio, in August, 1970, police attempted to break up a fight between Black youths; a gathering crowd attacked them with rocks for several hours. The following day, the violence escalated, as young people hurled heavier debris, such as concrete blocks and bottles, and damaged cars and injured bystanders. Finally, after two days of skirmishes with police, Hinton writes, \"one thousand people, mostly of junior high school age, came out throwing rocks and other objects.\" Police deployed more than thirty cannisters of tear gas to disperse the rebels, but the presence of police was, itself, the provocation. Officers moved to the perimeter so they could monitor but not further agitate the crowd. This was a short-lived strategy: they then made another show of force, touching off another round of conflict, which, according to reports, resulted in property destruction.\n\nSimilar rebellions occurred from Lorman, Mississippi, to Gum Spring, Virginia, in 1968, and Pine Bluff, Arkansas, to Erie, Pennsylvania, in 1970. Though the South is seen as the site of the nonviolent civil-rights movement and the North as where its noble objectives died, the wide scale of Black uprisings, from Southern towns to Midwestern cities, reveals widespread dissatisfaction with peaceful protest as a means to accomplish social change-which may suggest that we reconsider the assumption that the civil-rights movement was successful. For Hinton, the sheer scale of the uprisings, involving tens of thousands of ordinary Black Americans, challenges the idea that these were mindless \"riots\" involving wayward or misguided people. So, too, does the fact that Black violence almost always came in response to white violence aimed at controlling the ambitions and lives of Black people. Hinton writes: \"These events did not represent a wave of criminality, but a sustained insurgency. The violence was in response to moments of tangible racism-'a single incident,' as [President Lyndon] Johnson said-almost always taking the form of a police encounter. Yet the tens of thousands of Black Americans who participated in this collective violence were rebelling not just against police brutality. They were rebelling against a broader system that had entrenched unequal conditions and anti-Black violence over generations.\"\n\nHinton is not just recovering Black resistance; she is also exposing a long, and ignored, history of white political violence, used to maintain the subordinated status of Black communities. Hinton's book begins by acquainting readers with the history of post-emancipation white vigilantism, which lasted well into the twentieth century. The most infamous of these assaults took place in 1921, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where three hundred African-Americans were massacred by their white neighbors. But, even after the Second World War, as millions of Black Americans escaped the suffocating racism of the American South, they were greeted elsewhere by white mobs anxious to keep them confined to segregated enclaves. It is no exaggeration to say that tens of thousands of white people participated in riotous forms of violence to, as Hinton writes, police \"the activities of Black people and to limit their access to jobs, leisure, the franchise and to the political sphere.\"\n\nWhite police were not only reluctant to arrest white perpetrators; in many instances, they participated in the violence. Hinton dedicates an entire chapter to the ways in which white supremacists and police converged, in the name of law and order, to dominate rebellious Black communities. Outside of large metropolitan areas, understaffed police forces deputized white citizens to patrol and control Black protests. According to Hinton, in August of 1968, in Salisbury, Maryland, the police department \"installed an all-white, 216-member volunteer force to aid the regular 40-man force in the event of a riot.\" In other instances, white cops allowed white residents to harass, beat, shoot, and even murder African-Americans with no reprisals. In the small town of Cairo, Illinois, a Black rebellion in 1967 brought together white police and white vigilantes in a concerted effort to isolate and suppress African-Americans. After the initial uprising, sparked by the suspicious death of a Black soldier in the city jail, white residents formed a vigilante group dubbed the Committee of Ten Million-a name inspired by a letter written by the former President Dwight Eisenhower, which called for a \"committee of ten million citizens\" to restore law and order after the uprisings in Detroit and Newark. Cairo police deputized this group to patrol Black neighborhoods, including the public-housing development Pyramid Courts, where the majority of the nearly three thousand Black people of Cairo lived. In 1969, the \"white hats,\" as the committee members had taken to calling themselves, fired shots into Pyramid Courts. When Black residents took up arms in self-defense, periodically curfews were imposed but applied only to Pyramid Courts residents. In response, the National Guard was periodically deployed to police Pyramid Courts. But local police would also fire into the development with machine guns from an armored vehicle (described by Black locals as the Great Intimidator). No one was killed, but Black families would sometimes sleep in bathtubs to avoid the gunfire. Black men also shot out the street lights to obscure the view of white snipers. This amounted to a war on the Black residents of Cairo, which lasted until 1972. Hinton recounts that the mayor of Cairo gave an interview to ABC News, in 1970, in which he said, of Black citizens, \"If we have to kill them, we'll have to kill them. . . . It seems to me that this is the only way we are going to solve our problem.\" Hinton goes on to observe that, in all of the hundreds of rebellions of this period, \"the police did not arrest a single white citizen. . . . even though white citizens had been perpetrators and instigators. White people could attack Black people and face no consequences; Black people were criminalized and punished for defending themselves and their communities.\"\n\nHinton builds upon the arguments of her previous book, \" From the War on Poverty to the War on Crime ,\" to explain how the rebellions of the 1968-72 period came to be overlooked. Lyndon Johnson's declaration of a \"war on crime,\" in 1965, opened up new and lavish spending to local law enforcement, reducing the need for the deployment of the National Guard and federal troops to put down Black rebellions. The absence of federal intervention removed these conflicts from national focus, making them local matters. Meanwhile, the buildup of local police forces, loosely packaged as \"community policing,\" promoted police encroachment into all aspects of Black social life, transforming typical youthful transgressions into fodder for police assaults on young Black people. Places where Black youth congregated, including public-housing developments, public schools, and historically Black colleges and universities, were now sites of police surveillance and potential arrest. These encounters between police and Black youth set the stage for what Hinton describes as \"the cycle\" of police abuse, in which police incursions provoked a violent response, which justified greater police presence and, in another turn, more combative responses. In this period, which saw the ascendance of the Black Panther Party and the radicalization of Black politics far beyond the expectation of simply achieving equality with whites, young Black people in working-class communities fought back against police attempts to criminalize their daily activities or to ensnare them in the life-altering criminal-justice system.\n\nBlack resistance took different forms, from Black residents pelting police with bricks and bottles to Black snipers shooting at police, with the purpose of driving them out of their communities. Black snipers, in particular, fulfilled political fantasies that demonized all forms of Black resistance as pathological and deserving of violent pacification. From 1967 to 1974, the number of police killed in the line of duty jumped from seventy-six to a hundred and thirty-two, the highest annual figure ever. But those totals were dwarfed by the number of young Black men killed by the police in the same period. Hinton reports that, between 1968 and 1974, \"Black people were the victims of one in four police killings,\" resulting in nearly a hundred Black men under twenty-five dying at the hands of police in each of those years. By comparison, today only one in ten people killed by police is Black, according to the Centers for Disease Control. (Hinton cites this figure but notes that it may represent underreporting.)\n\nThis cycle of abuse could not continue. The crucible period of rebellion was over by the end of the seventies. It was not reform that brought its end; it was repression. Prison became a way of dealing with pugnacious Black youth. By the mid-seventies, according to Hinton, seventy-five percent of African-Americans imprisoned were under the age of thirty. Rebellion as a collective rejection of the quotidian acts of police violence became infrequent, she writes, as \"Black Americans had more or less resigned themselves to the policing of everyday life.\" For the past forty years, uprisings in response to police abuse have \"tended to break out only after exceptional incidents of police brutality or miscarried justice.\"\n\nIn some of the most powerful parts of \"America on Fire,\" Hinton systematically unravels the failures of police reform. More than fifty years ago, the Kerner Commission reached the damning conclusion that, unless there were a massive redistribution of resources into Black communities, patterns of segregation across the United States would deepen and, along with them, resentment and retaliation by African-Americans. As the report observed :\n\nNo American-white or black-can escape the consequences of the continuing social and economic decay of our major cities. Only a commitment to national action on an unprecedented scale can shape a future compatible with the historic ideals of American society. The major need is to generate new will-the will to tax ourselves to the extent necessary, to meet the vital needs of the nation.\n\nBut, without clear mechanisms for enforcement of the commission's recommendations, they went unheeded. Kerner established a model for commissions on race, policing, and inequality that has persisted to the present, creating a rich archive of public hearings documenting the racism and abuse directed at Black citizens that has led to very little being done about it.\n\nThis bleak reality is evidence of the shortsightedness of the liberal premise that exposing a problem is the first step in its resolution. In fact, as the Kerner Commission explained, fixing those problems would require unprecedented action. It would mean using the powers of the judiciary and the federal bureaucracy to dismantle systems of residential segregation, school segregation, and the racial segmentation of American workplaces. It would also mean leveraging financial resources to end the endemic poverty that made Black Americans disproportionately vulnerable and visible to police in the first place. Instead, just months after the publication of the Kerner Report, Richard Nixon ran a successful Presidential campaign impugning Black rebellion as mere \"crime\" while arguing that he could restore law and order in the nation's cities. When running for reëlection, in 1972, Nixon coupled his theme of law and order and a new declaration of a \"war on drugs\" with an anti-welfare message that would become a theme of Republican politics for a generation, cohering a new, white \"silent majority\" around the politics of racial resentment and subordinating the demands of the Black minority. Hinton paints a bleak picture, in which the dual agenda of the Reagan Administration, of strengthening law enforcement while weakening social programs, helped to maintain the conditions that legitimized the expanding powers of police and growing prison populations. Though rising murder rates seemed to blunt the logic that more crime-control measures would make people safer, any skepticism was easily depicted as insufficient concern about safety and crime. Politically, elected officials goaded one another to demand tougher laws, tougher punishment, tougher enforcement. Between 1970 and 1980, the number of people incarcerated in federal and state prisons jumped by fifty per cent.\n\nMore than fifty years after the Kerner Commission, we have seen in the past eight years the return of Black rebellions in response to growing inequality that has been managed by the forces of racist and abusive policing. This is not history repeating itself; it is evidence that the problems that gave rise to earlier Black rebellions have not been resolved. Hinton observes that the \"contemporary movement for racial justice has built upon earlier traditions, creating a type of militant, nonviolent protest that blended the direct action tactics of the civil rights movement with the critiques of systemic racism that are often identified with Black power.\" Hinton argues that the persistence of inequality, coupled with new cycles of violence between the policed and law enforcement, is evidence that we must \"move beyond reform.\" But the enormousness of that task seems to stop Hinton in her tracks. She is not naïve about the difficulty of effecting the changes that are necessary to rein in abusive police while also solving deep and long-standing inequities that always legitimize policing. With this in mind, she avoids the temptation to neatly wrap up this history with simplistic suggestions for more public policies that stand no chance of approval or will inevitably fail to be enforced. She does, however, suggest that regressive-taxation formulas that starve public programs of funding be reformed. She also calls for establishing a justice system \"based on the principle of repair instead of retribution.\" But these recommendations pale in comparison with the power of collective protest that she expertly documents throughout the book.\n\nThere are no easy answers to the question of how to end the cycle of racist and abusive policing, but the force of resistance and rebellion has been the most effective way of both exposing the problem and pressuring authorities to act. The biggest difference between now and the earlier crucible period of rebellion is that today's uprisings are increasingly multiracial. Since the uprising in Los Angeles in 1992 and certainly the rebellions of last summer, Latinx and ordinary white people have been inspired by rebellion as a legitimate form of protest. The rebellions of last summer involved thousands of white people who were also angered by the abuses of police and by the deepening unfairness of our society. Protesters' demands to \"defund the police\" brought together new coalitions to challenge the entwined political realities of funding law enforcement and ignoring social-welfare services while injecting new arguments into the public discussion of this very old problem of racist police abuse. This won't end police brutality, but it can expand the number of people who also see themselves as victimized by deformed public policies. The larger the movement, the harder it is to maintain the status quo.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "The Matter of Black Lives\n\nOn February 18th, as part of the official recognition of Black History Month, President Obama met with a group of African-American leaders at the White House to discuss civil-rights issues. The guests-who included Representative John Lewis , of Georgia; Sherrilyn Ifill, the director-counsel of the N.A.A.C.P. Legal Defense and Educational Fund; and Wade Henderson, who heads the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights-were intent on pressing the President to act decisively on criminal-justice issues during his last year in office. Their urgency, though, was tempered by a degree of sentimentality, verging on nostalgia. As Ifill later told me, \"We were very much aware that this was the last Black History Month of this Presidency.\"\n\nBut the meeting was also billed as the \"first of its kind,\" in that it would bring together different generations of activists. To that end, the White House had invited DeRay Mckesson, Brittany Packnett, and Aislinn Pulley, all of whom are prominent figures in Black Lives Matter, which had come into existence-amid the flash points of the George Zimmerman trial; Michael Brown's death, in Ferguson, Missouri; and the massacre at the Emanuel A.M.E. Church, in Charleston, South Carolina-during Obama's second term.\n\nPublished in the print edition of the March 14, 2016 , issue.\n\nBlack Lives Matter has been described as \"not your grandfather's civil-rights movement,\" to distinguish its tactics and its philosophy from those of nineteen-sixties-style activism. Like the Occupy movement, it eschews hierarchy and centralized leadership, and its members have not infrequently been at odds with older civil-rights leaders and with the Obama Administration-as well as with one another. So it wasn't entirely surprising when Pulley, a community organizer in Chicago, declined the White House invitation, on the ground that the meeting was nothing more than a \"photo opportunity\" for the President. She posted a statement online in which she said that she \"could not, with any integrity, participate in such a sham that would only serve to legitimize the false narrative that the government is working to end police brutality and the institutional racism that fuels it.\" Her skepticism was attributable, in part, to the fact that she lives and works in a city whose mayor, Rahm Emanuel, Obama's former chief of staff, is embroiled in a controversy stemming from a yearlong coverup of the fatal shooting by police of an African-American teen-ager.\n\nMckesson, a full-time activist, and Packnett, the executive director of Teach for America in St. Louis, did accept the invitation, and they later described the meeting as constructive. Mckesson tweeted: \"Why did I go to the mtg w/ @ POTUS today? B/c there are things we can do now to make folks' lives better today, tomorrow, & the day after.\" Two weeks earlier, Mckesson had announced that he would be a candidate in the Baltimore mayoral race, and Obama's praise, after the meeting, for his \"outstanding work mobilizing in Baltimore\" was, if not an endorsement, certainly politically valuable.\n\nThat split in the response to the White House, however, reflected a larger conflict: while Black Lives Matter's insistent outsider status has allowed it to shape the dialogue surrounding race and criminal justice in this country, it has also sparked a debate about the limits of protest, particularly of online activism. Meanwhile, internal disputes have raised questions about what the movement hopes to achieve, and about its prospects for success.\n\nThe phrase \"black lives matter\" was born in July of 2013, in a Facebook post by Alicia Garza, called \"a love letter to black people.\" The post was intended as an affirmation for a community distraught over George Zimmerman's acquittal in the shooting death of seventeen-year-old Trayvon Martin, in Sanford, Florida. Garza, now thirty-five, is the special-projects director in the Oakland office of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, which represents twenty thousand caregivers and housekeepers, and lobbies for labor legislation on their behalf. She is also an advocate for queer and transgender rights and for anti-police-brutality campaigns.\n\nGarza has a prodigious social-media presence, and on the day that the Zimmerman verdict was handed down she posted, \"the sad part is, there's a section of America who is cheering and celebrating right now. and that makes me sick to my stomach. we GOTTA get it together y'all.\" Later, she added, \"btw stop saying we are not surprised. that's a damn shame in itself. I continue to be surprised at how little Black lives matter. And I will continue that. stop giving up on black life.\" She ended with \"black people. I love you. I love us. Our lives matter.\"\n\nGarza's friend Patrisse Cullors amended the last three words to create a hashtag: #BlackLivesMatter. Garza sometimes writes haiku-she admires the economy of the form-and in those four syllables she recognized a distillation not only of the anger that attended Zimmerman's acquittal but also of the animating principle at the core of black social movements dating back more than a century.\n\nGarza grew up as Alicia Schwartz, in Marin County, where she was raised by her African-American mother and her Jewish stepfather, who run an antiques store. Her brother Joey, who works for the family business, is almost young enough to have been Trayvon Martin's peer. That is one reason, she says, that the Zimmerman verdict affected her so deeply. The family was not particularly political, but Garza showed an interest in activism in middle school, when she worked to have information about contraception made available to students in Bay Area schools.\n\nShe went on to study anthropology and sociology at the University of California, San Diego. When she was twenty-three, she told her family that she was queer. They reacted to the news with equanimity. \"I think it helped that my parents are an interracial couple,\" she told me. \"Even if they didn't fully understand what it meant, they were supportive.\" For a few years, Garza held various jobs in the social-justice sector. She found the work fulfilling, but, she said, \"San Francisco broke my heart over and over. White progressives would actually argue with us about their right to determine what was best for communities they never had to live in.\"\n\nIn 2003, she met Malachi Garza, a gregarious, twenty-four-year-old trans male activist, who ran training sessions for organizers. They married five years later. In 2009, early on the morning of New Year's Day, a transit-police officer named Johannes Mehserle fatally shot Oscar Grant, a twenty-two-year-old African-American man, in the Fruitvale BART station, in Oakland, three blocks from where the Garzas live. Alicia was involved in a fight for fair housing in San Francisco at the time, but Malachi, who was by then the director of the Community Justice Network for Youth, immersed himself in a campaign to have Mehserle brought up on murder charges. (He was eventually convicted of involuntary manslaughter, and served one year of a two-year sentence.)\n\nGrant died nineteen days before Barack Obama's first Inauguration. (The film \"Fruitvale Station,\" a dramatic recounting of the last day of Grant's life, contrasts his death with the national exuberance following the election.) His killing was widely seen as a kind of political counterpoint-a reminder that the grip of history would not be easily broken.\n\nGarza had met Patrisse Cullors in 2005, on a dance floor in Providence, Rhode Island, where they were both attending an organizers' conference. Cullors, a native of Los Angeles, had been organizing in the L.G.B.T.Q. community since she was a teen-ager-she came out as queer when she was sixteen and was forced to leave home-and she had earned a degree in religion and philosophy at U.C.L.A. She is now a special-projects director at the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights, in Oakland, which focusses on social justice in inner cities. Garza calls Cullors her \"twin.\" After Cullors created the Black Lives Matter hashtag, the two women began promoting it. Opal Tometi , a writer and an immigration-rights organizer in Brooklyn, whom Garza had met at a conference in 2012, offered to build a social-media platform, on Facebook and Twitter, where activists could connect with one another. The women also began thinking about how to turn the phrase into a movement.\n\nBlack Lives Matter didn't reach a wider public until the following summer, when a police officer named Darren Wilson shot and killed eighteen-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson. Darnell Moore, a writer and an activist based in Brooklyn, who knew Cullors, coördinated \"freedom rides\" to Missouri from New York, Chicago, Portland, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Boston. Within a few weeks of Brown's death, hundreds of people who had never participated in organized protests took to the streets, and that campaign eventually exposed Ferguson as a case study of structural racism in America and a metaphor for all that had gone wrong since the end of the civil-rights movement.\n\nDeRay Mckesson, who was twenty-nine at the time and working as an administrator in the Minneapolis public-school system, watched as responses to Brown's death rolled through his Twitter feed, and decided to drive the six hundred miles to Ferguson to witness the scene himself. Before he left, he posted a request for housing on Facebook. Teach for America's Brittany Packnett helped him find a place; before moving to Minneapolis, he had taught sixth-grade math as a T.F.A. employee in Brooklyn. Soon after his arrival, he attended a street-medic training session, where he met Johnetta Elzie, a twenty-five-year-old St. Louis native. With Packnett, they began sharing information about events and tweeting updates from demonstrations, and they quickly became the most recognizable figures associated with the movement in Ferguson. For their efforts, he and Elzie received the Howard Zinn Freedom to Write Award, in 2015, and Packnett was appointed to the President's Commission on Twenty-first Century Policing.\n\nYet, although the three of them are among the most identifiable names associated with the Black Lives Matter movement, none of them officially belong to a chapter of the organization. Elzie, in fact, takes issue with people referring to Garza, Cullors, and Tometi as founders. As she sees it, Ferguson is the cradle of the movement, and no chapter of the organization exists there or anywhere in the greater St. Louis area. That contentious distinction between the organization and the movement is part of the debate about what Black Lives Matter is and where it will go next.\n\nThe central contradiction of the civil-rights movement was that it was a quest for democracy led by organizations that frequently failed to function democratically. W. E. B. Du Bois , in his 1903 essay \"The Talented Tenth,\" wrote that \"the Negro race, like all races, is going to be saved by its exceptional men,\" and the traditional narrative of the battle for the rights of African-Americans has tended to read like a great-black-man theory of history. But, starting a generation ago, civil-rights historians concluded that their field had focussed too heavily on the movement's leaders. New scholarship began charting the contributions of women, local activists, and small organizations-the lesser-known elements that enabled the grand moments we associate with the civil-rights era. In particular, the career of Ella Baker, who was a director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and who oversaw the founding of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, came to be seen as a counter-model to the careers of leaders like Martin Luther King, Jr. Baker was emphatically averse to the spotlight. Barbara Ransby, a professor of history and gender studies at the University of Illinois at Chicago, who wrote a biography of Baker, told me that, during the nineteen-forties, when Baker was a director of branches for the N.A.A.C.P., \"she would go into small towns and say, 'Whom are you reaching out to?' And she'd tell them that if you're not reaching out to the town drunk you're not really working for the rights of black people. The folk who were getting rounded up and thrown in jail had to be included.\"\n\nCullors says, \"The consequence of focussing on a leader is that you develop a necessity for that leader to be the one who's the spokesperson and the organizer, who tells the masses where to go, rather than the masses understanding that we can catalyze a movement in our own community.\" Or, as Garza put it, \"The model of the black preacher leading people to the promised land isn't working right now.\" Jesse Jackson-a former aide to King and a two-time Presidential candidate, who won seven primaries and four caucuses in 1988-was booed when he tried to address young protesters in Ferguson, who saw him as an interloper. That response was seen as indicative of a generational divide. But the divide was as much philosophical as it was generational, and one that was visible half a century earlier.\n\nGarza, Cullors, and Tometi advocate a horizontal ethic of organizing, which favors democratic inclusion at the grassroots level. Black Lives Matter emerged as a modern extension of Ella Baker's thinking-a preference for ten thousand candles rather than a single spotlight. In a way, they created the context and the movement created itself. \"Really, the genesis of the organization was the people who organized in their cities for the ride to Ferguson,\" Garza told me in her office. Those people, she said, \"pushed us to create a chapter structure. They wanted to continue to do this work together, and be connected to activists and organizers from across the country.\" There are now more than thirty Black Lives Matter chapters in the United States, and one in Toronto. They vary in structure and emphasis, and operate with a great deal of latitude, particularly when it comes to choosing what \"actions\" to stage. But prospective chapters must submit to a rigorous assessment, by a coördinator, of the kinds of activism that members have previously engaged in, and they must commit to the organization's guiding principles. These are laid out in a thirteen-point statement written by the women and Darnell Moore, which calls for, in part, an ideal of unapologetic blackness. \"In affirming that black lives matter, we need not qualify our position,\" the statement reads.\n\nYet, although the movement initially addressed the killing of unarmed young black men, the women were equally committed to the rights of working people and to gender and sexual equality. So the statement also espouses inclusivity, because \"to love and desire freedom and justice for ourselves is a necessary prerequisite for wanting the same for others.\" Garza's argument for inclusivity is informed by the fact that she-a black queer female married to a trans male-would likely have found herself marginalized not only in the society she hopes to change but also in many of the organizations that are dedicated to changing it. She also dismisses the kind of liberalism that finds honor in nonchalance. \"We want to make sure that people are not saying, 'Well, whatever you are, I don't care,' \" she said. \"No, I want you to care. I want you to see all of me.\"\n\nBlack activists have organized in response to police brutality for decades, but part of the reason for the visibility of the current movement is the fact that such problems have persisted-and, from the public's perspective, at least, have seemed to escalate-during the first African-American Presidency. Obama's election was seen as the culmination of years of grassroots activism that built the political power of black Americans, but the naïve dream of a post-racial nation foundered even before he was sworn into office. As Garza put it, \"Conditions have shifted, so our institutions have shifted to meet those conditions. Barack Obama comes out after Trayvon is murdered and does this weird, half-ass thing where he's, like, 'That could've been my son,' and at the same time he starts scolding young black men.\" In short, all this would seem to suggest, until there was a black Presidency it was impossible to conceive of the limitations of one. Obama, as a young community organizer in Chicago, determined that he could bring about change more effectively through electoral politics; Garza is of a generation of activists who have surveyed the circumstances of his Presidency and drawn the opposite conclusion.\n\nI met up with Garza in downtown San Francisco last August, on an afternoon when the icy winds felt like a rebuke to summer. A lively crowd of several hundred people had gathered in United Nations Plaza for Trans Liberation Tuesday, an event that was being held in twenty cities across the country. A transgender opera singer sang \"Amazing Grace.\" Then Janetta Johnson, a black trans activist, said, \"We've been in the street for Oscar Grant, for Trayvon Martin, for Eric Garner. It's time for our community to show up for trans women.\"\n\nThe names of Grant, Martin, and Garner-who died in 2014, after being put in a choke hold by police on Staten Island-are now part of the canon of the wrongfully dead. The point of Trans Liberation Tuesday was to draw attention to the fact that there are others, such as Ashton O'Hara and Amber Monroe, black trans people who were killed just weeks apart in Detroit last year, whose names may not be known to the public but who are no less emblematic of a broader social concern. According to a report by the Human Rights Campaign, between 2013 and 2015 there were fifty-three known murders of transgender people; thirty-nine of the victims were African-American.\n\nGarza addressed the crowd for just four minutes; she is not given to soaring rhetoric, but speaks with clarity and confidence. She began with a roll call of the underrepresented: \"We understand that, in our communities, black trans folk, gender-nonconforming folk, black queer folk, black women, black disabled folk-we have been leading movements for a long time, but we have been erased from the official narrative.\" Yet, over all, her comments were more concerned with the internal dynamics of race. For Garza, the assurance that black lives matter is as much a reminder directed at black people as it is a revelation aimed at whites. The message of Trans Liberation Tuesday was that, as society at large has devalued black lives, the African-American community is guilty of devaluing lives based on gender and sexuality.\n\nThe kind of ecumenical activism that Garza espouses has deep roots in the Bay Area. In 1966, in Oakland, Huey P. Newton co-founded the Black Panther Party, which was practically defined by hyperbolic masculinity. Four years later, he made a statement whose message was, at the time, rare for the left, not to mention the broader culture. In a Party newsletter, he wrote:\n\nWe have not said much about the homosexual at all, but we must relate to the homosexual movement because it is a real thing. And I know through reading, and through my life experience and observations, that homosexuals are not given freedom and liberty by anyone in the society. They might be the most oppressed people in the society.\n\nThe movement remained steadfastly masculinist, but by the nineteen-eighties Newton's words had begun to appear prescient. When I asked Garza about the most common misperception of Black Lives Matter, she pointed to a frequent social-media dig that it is \"a gay movement masquerading as a black one.\" But the organization's fundamental point has been to challenge the assumption that those two things are mutually exclusive. In 1989, the race-theory and legal scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw introduced the principle of \"intersectionality,\" by which multiple identities coexist and complicate the ways in which we typically think of class, race, gender, and sexuality as social problems. \"Our work is heavily influenced by Crenshaw's theory,\" Garza told me. \"People think that we're engaged with identity politics. The truth is that we're doing what the labor movement has always done-organizing people who are at the bottom.\"\n\nAs was the case during the civil-rights movement, there are no neat distinctions between the activities of formal organizations and those incited by an atmosphere of social unrest. That ambiguity can be an asset when it inspires entry-level activism among people who had never attended a protest, as happened in Ferguson. But it can be a serious liability when actions contrary to the principles of the movement are associated with it. In December, 2014, video surfaced of a march in New York City, called in response to the deaths of Eric Garner and others, where some protesters chanted that they wanted to see \"dead cops.\" The event was part of the Millions March, which was led by a coalition of organizations, but the chant was attributed to Black Lives Matter. Several months later, the footage provoked controversy. \"For four weeks, Bill O'Reilly was flashing my picture on the screen and saying we're a hate group,\" Garza said.\n\nA week after the march, a troubled drifter named Ismaaiyl Brinsley fatally shot two New York City police officers, Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu, as they sat in their patrol car, before killing himself. Some observers argued that, although Brinsley had not identified with any group, his actions were the result of an anti-police climate created by Black Lives Matter. Last summer, not long after Dylann Roof killed nine African-Americans at the Emanuel A.M.E. Church, South Carolina's governor, Nikki Haley, implied that the movement had so intimidated police officers that they were unable to do their jobs, thereby putting more black lives at risk. All of this was accompanied by an increasing skepticism, across the political spectrum, about whether Black Lives Matter could move beyond reacting to outrages and begin proactively shaping public policy.\n\nThe current Presidential campaign has presented the movement with a crucial opportunity to address that question. Last summer, at the annual Netroots Nation conference of progressive activists, in Phoenix, Martin O'Malley made his candidacy a slightly longer shot when he responded to a comment about Black Lives Matter by asserting that all lives matter-an evasion of the specificity of black concerns, which elicited a chorus of boos. At the same event, activists interrupted Bernie Sanders . The Sanders campaign made overtures to the movement following the incident, but three weeks later, on the eve of the first anniversary of Michael Brown's death, two protesters identifying themselves as Black Lives Matter activists-Marissa Johnson and Mara Willaford-disrupted a Sanders rally in Seattle, preventing the Senator from addressing several thousand people who had gathered to hear him. The women were booed by the largely white crowd, but the dissent wasn't limited to whites. This was the kind of freestyle disruption that caused even some African-Americans to wonder how the movement was choosing its targets. At the time, it did seem odd to have gone after Sanders twice, given that he is the most progressive candidate in the race, and that none of the Republican candidates had been disrupted in their campaigns.\n\nGarza argues that the strategy has been to leverage influence among the Democrats, since ninety per cent of African-Americans vote Democratic. She says that it will be uncomfortable for voters if \"the person that you are supporting hasn't actually done what they need to be doing, in terms of addressing the real concern of people under this broad banner.\" She defended the Seattle action, saying that it was \"part of a very localized dynamic, but an important one,\" and added that \"without being disrupted Sanders wouldn't have released a platform on racial justice.\" Afterward, Sanders hired Symone Sanders, an African-American woman, to be his national press secretary. He also released a statement on civil rights that prominently featured the names of African-American victims of police violence, and he began frequently referring to Black Lives Matter on the campaign trail. He subsequently won the support of many younger black activists, including Eric Garner's daughter.\n\nAn attempt to disrupt a Hillary Clinton rally early in the campaign, in New Hampshire, failed when the protesters arrived too late to get into the hall. But Clinton met with them privately afterward, and engaged in a debate about mass incarceration. She has met with members of the movement on other occasions, too. Clinton has the support of older generations of black leaders and activists-including Eric Garner's mother-and she decisively carried the black vote in Super Tuesday primaries across the South. But she has been repeatedly criticized by other activists for her support of President Bill Clinton's 1994 crime bill, and, particularly, for comments that she made, in the nineties, about \"superpredators\" and the need \"to bring them to heel.\" Two weeks ago, Ashley Williams, a twenty-three-year-old who describes herself as an \"independent organizer for the movement for black lives,\" interrupted a private fund-raising event in Charleston, where Clinton was speaking, to demand an apology. The next day, Clinton told the Washington Post , \"Looking back, I shouldn't have used those words, and I wouldn't use them today.\"\n\nIf Black Lives Matter has been an object lesson in the power of social media, it has also revealed the medium's pitfalls. Just as the movement was enjoying newfound influence among the Democratic Presidential contenders, it was also gaining attention for a series of febrile Twitter exchanges. In one, DeRay Mckesson and Johnetta Elzie got into a dispute with Shaun King, a writer for the Daily News , over fund-raising for a social-justice group. The conservative Web site Breitbart ran a picture of Mckesson and King with the headline \" BLACK LIVES MATTER LEADERS JUST EXCOMMUNICATED SHAUN KING .\"\n\nLast month, it was announced that Garza would speak at Webster University, in St. Louis, which prompted an acrimonious social-media response from people in the area who are caught up in the debate over the movement's origins. Elzie tweeted, \"Thousands of ppl without platforms who have NO CLUE who the 'three' are, and their work/sacrifice gets erased,\" and said that the idea that Garza is a founder of the movement is a \"lie.\" Garza released a statement saying that she had cancelled the event \"due to threats and online attacks on our organization and us as individuals from local activists with whom we have made an effort to have meaningful dialogue.\" She continued, \"We all lose when bullying and personal attacks become a substitute for genuine conversation and principled disagreement.\"\n\nThere's nothing novel about personality conflicts arising among activists, but to older organizers, who had watched as federal surveillance and infiltration programs sowed discord that all but wrecked the Black Power movement, the public airing of grievances seemed particularly amateurish. \"Movements are destroyed by conflicts over money, power, and credit,\" Garza said, a week after the cancellation. \"We have to take seriously the impact of not being able to have principled disagreement, or we're not going to be around very long.\"\n\nAlmost from the outset, Black Lives Matter has been compared to the Occupy movement. Occupy was similarly associated with a single issue-income inequality-which it transformed into a movement through social media. Its focus on the one per cent played a key role in the 2012 election, and it likely contributed to the unexpected support for Bernie Sanders's campaign. To the movement's critics, however, its achievements fell short of its promise. Its dissipation seemed to prove that, while the Internet can foster the creation of a new movement, it can just as easily threaten its survival.\n\nBlack Lives Matter would appear to face similar concerns, though in recent months the movement has tacked in new directions. In November, the Ella Baker Center received a five-hundred-thousand-dollar grant from Google, for Patrisse Cullors to further develop a program to help California residents monitor and respond to acts of police violence. Last year, Mckesson, with Elzie, Brittany Packnett, and Samuel Sinyangwe, a twenty-five-year-old data analyst with a degree from Stanford, launched Campaign Zero, a list of policing-policy recommendations that calls for, among other things, curtailing arrests for low-level crimes, reducing quotas for summonses and arrests, and demilitarizing police departments. To date, neither Clinton nor Sanders has endorsed the platform, but both have met with the activists to discuss it.\n\nThe announcement of Mckesson's mayoral candidacy, which he made on Twitter-he has more than three hundred thousand followers-is the most dramatic break from the movement's previous actions. (Beyoncé has more than fourteen million followers, but she follows only ten people. Mckesson is one of them.) Mckesson is a native of Baltimore and he grew up on the same side of town as Freddie Gray, whose death last year in police custody sparked protests and riots in the city-at which Mckesson was a frequent presence. His family struggled with poverty and drug addiction, but he excelled academically and went on to attend Bowdoin College, in Maine. He will be running against twenty-eight other candidates. One of them, the city councilman Nick Mosby, is married to Marilyn Mosby, the Maryland state's attorney, who is handling the prosecution of the six police officers indicted in connection with Gray's death.\n\nIn Baltimore, Mckesson told me that he is using his savings to fund his activist work. \"It's totally possible to have Beyoncé follow you on Twitter and still be broke,\" he said. (BuzzFeed reported that a former Citibank executive would host an event at his New York City home to raise funds for Mckesson's campaign.) He wouldn't discuss his candidacy's implications for the movement, but he is very serious about running. Two weeks ago, he released a twenty-six-page report detailing his platform for reforming the city's schools, police department, and economic infrastructure. He has already been attacked for his connection to Teach for America; after he released his plan for improving Baltimore's schools, it was dismissed as a corporatist undertaking along the lines of Michael Bloomberg's and Rahm Emanuel's reforms. He rejects the idea that his lack of experience in elected office should be an obstacle. When I asked how he thought he would be able to get members of the city council and the state legislature to support his ideas, he said, \"I think we build relationships. That question seems to come from a place of traditional reading of politics. That says, 'If you don't know people already, then you cannot be successful.' Politics as usual actually hasn't turned into a change in outcomes here.\"\n\nGarza is tactful when she talks about Mckesson's campaign. \"I'm in favor of people getting in where they fit in. Wherever you feel you can make the greatest contribution, you should,\" she said. But she doesn't see it as her role to define the future of the movement. She told me an anecdote that illustrates the non-centrality of her role. Last month, on Martin Luther King Day, she and Malachi were driving into San Francisco, where she was scheduled to appear at a community forum, when they heard on the radio that the Bay Bridge had been shut down. Members of a coalition of organizations, including the Bay Area chapter of Black Lives Matter, had driven onto the bridge, laced chains through their car windows, and locked them to the girders, shutting down entry to the city from Oakland. Garza had known that there were plans to mark the holiday with a protest-marches and other events were called across the nation-but she was not informed of this specific activity planned in her own city. \"It's not like there's a red button I push to make people turn up,\" she said. It would have been inconceivable for, say, the S.C.L.C. to have carried out such an ambitious action without the leadership's being aware of every detail.\n\nIn January, Garza travelled to Washington, to attend President Obama's final State of the Union address; she had been invited by Barbara Lee, her congressional representative. (Lee, who was the sole member of Congress to vote against the authorization of military force after 9/11, has a high standing among activists who are normally skeptical of elected officials.) After the speech, as Garza stood outside in the cold, trying to hail a cab, she said that she was disappointed. The President had not driven home the need for police reform. He had spoken of economic inequality and a political system rigged to benefit the few, but had scarcely touched upon the implications of that system for African-Americans specifically. From the vantage point of black progressives, his words were a kind of all-lives-matter statement of public policy.\n\nA year from now, Barack Obama will leave office, and with him will go a particular set of expectations of racial rapprochement. So will the sense that what happened in Sanford, Ferguson, Baltimore, Charleston, and Staten Island represents a paradox. Black Lives Matter may never have more influence than it has now. The future is not knowable, but it isn't likely to be unfamiliar. ♦\n\nAn earlier version of this article misstated Mckesson's age at the time.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "Until Black Women Are Free, None of Us Will Be Free\n\nI first encountered the Combahee River Collective Statement in a women's-studies class, my second year of college at SUNY Buffalo. We had been reading about divisions within the feminist movement in the late nineteen-sixties and early nineteen-seventies, and the emergence of a body of thought captured in the framework of \"Black feminism.\" The Combahee River Collective was a small organization, but it involved some of the luminaries of Black feminism: Barbara Smith and her twin sister, Beverly Smith, as well as Demita Frazier, Cheryl Clarke, Akasha Hull, Margo Okazawa-Rey, Chirlane McCray, and Audre Lorde. Equally dismayed by the direction of the feminist movement, which they believed to be dominated by middle-class white women, and the suffocating masculinity in Black-nationalist organizations, they set out to formulate their own politics and strategies in response to their distinct experiences as Black women. But they were not only reacting to the deficits they found in organizations led by white women and Black men. They were also inspired by the national liberation and anti-colonial movements, from the Algerian struggle against the French occupation to the Vietnamese resistance to the American war. The C.R.C. saw themselves as revolutionaries whose aspirations far exceeded women's rights: they aspired to the overthrow of capitalism.\n\nThe Black women of the C.R.C. were not the first to break with white feminist and Black-nationalist organizations. In many ways, they built on the work of the Third World Women's Alliance, which was an outgrowth of the Black Women's Liberation Committee-a caucus of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. What distinguished the C.R.C.  from those groups was the explanatory power of their statement, which was first collected in Zillah Eisenstein's anthology \" Capitalist Patriarchy and the Case for Socialist Feminism ,\" in 1978. Reading the statement for the first time, two things struck me. The first was its effort to combine socialist politics with feminism. I had been a socialist since I was fourteen, and, in the groups that I had become active with, feminism was always painted as hostile to socialism. As it was explained to me, feminists saw the world as divided between men and women and not between classes. The Combahee Statement obliterated that premise. Theoretically rich and strategically nimble, it imagined a course of politics that could take Black women from the margins of society to the center of a revolution. Because Black women were among the most marginalized people in this country, their political struggles brought them into direct conflict with the intertwined malignancies of capitalism-racism, sexism, and poverty. Thus, the women of the C.R.C believed that, if Black women were successful in their struggles and movements, they would have an impact far beyond their immediate demands. As they put it, \"If Black women were free, it would mean that everyone else would have to be free since our freedom would necessitate the destruction of all the systems of oppression.\"\n\nMy other revelation came out of their insistence that \"Black feminism\" was necessary to clearly articulate the experiences of Black women. It had never occurred to me that the framework of \"race\" was not nearly capacious enough to capture the particular ways that Black women experienced American society. I had seen the everyday variety of racism in the U.S. that left most Black people with a bitter edge, at least those in my family. I had seen my father harassed by police, in Cincinnati, Ohio, for jaywalking. When I was seven, I saw my father jump in to stop a group of white teen-agers from threatening my older brother, only to have the police blame him for the altercation. But my mother's experiences were altogether different. She and my father met in high school, dated through college, and eventually landed in graduate school, at SUNY Buffalo, in the early nineteen-seventies. While my father believed that a revolution was within the grasp of those who fought hard enough to make it happen, my mother, who had studied English, French, and Spanish in college, was finishing her doctorate and raising me and my brother. My father left when I was two, and my mother took us to Dallas, where she worked as a reading specialist for the Dallas Independent School District. Three of her brothers followed her to Dallas, and one, a Vietnam veteran,  lived in our garage for a time, as he tried to jump-start his life. When, in the early eighties, my mother got burned out from haggling with less qualified white male administrators and a fancy career that was going nowhere fast, she started a house-cleaning business. She didn't know about the Volcker Shock and the recession that would follow. My mother's advanced degrees could not protect her from bankruptcy in 1982. They could not stop our lights from being periodically turned off, or a steady stream of bill collectors from coming to our front door. They could not help her relax, work less, or be more present. My mother died at fifty-two, fifteen years after she filed for bankruptcy; the chronic exhaustion she felt from work was masking the symptoms of an untreated and ultimately deadly case of lupus. Doris Jeanne Taylor's life was unceremoniously extinguished two weeks after she entered the hospital.\n\nIt was years before I pulled those different strands of my mother's life together. I was still annoyed by her absence and neglect when I was younger. It was not until long after her death that I saw the composite portrait of a single Black mother, raising two kids with a bankruptcy scuttling her credit, a perpetually faulty car draining her bank account, and a broad network of family members to care for. Racism alone could not explain what killed my mother. Gender was also an incomplete answer. It was the overlap of race, gender, and the aspirations to the comfort of a class that she poked around the edges of but could not ultimately break into. Black feminism made sense of my mother's life of work, her compulsory caretaking and debt. It made sense of her senseless death, just shy of the twenty-first century. Malcolm X made it plain: \"The most neglected person in America is the Black woman.\"\n\nAll of this stood in stark contradiction to what, as a young person, I had understood \"feminism\" to be. I had seen feminism as the domain of white women primarily concerned with glass ceilings and access to abortion. Those were fine things to act against and struggle for, but they felt like lightweight politics in contrast to the things that my nineteen-year-old self was concerned about: the U.S. presence in the Middle East, police brutality and racism, poverty and inequality. The women of the C.R.C. described how the myriad ways that Black women experienced oppression could translate into a radical rejection of the status quo. As they explained, \"Black feminists and many more Black women who do not define themselves as feminists have all experienced sexual oppression as a constant factor in our day-to-day existence.\" And they were doing even more than that: the Combahee Statement was also written to describe how race, gender, and sexual orientation were woven together in the lives of queer Black women. In describing the distinct experiences of Black women who were lesbians, they pioneered what would eventually become known as \"intersectionality\"-the idea that multiple identities can be constantly and simultaneously present within one person's body. The experiences of Black lesbians could not be reduced to gender, race, class, or sexuality. The C.R.C. demanded politics that could account for all, and not just aspects of their identity.\n\nMost important, the C.R.C. saw themselves as socialists and as part of the broader left, but they understood that no mass movement for socialism could be organized without responding to the particular forms of oppression experienced by Black women, Chicana women, lesbians, single mothers, and so many other groups. Their point was a simple one: you cannot expect people to join your movement by telling them to put their particular issues on hold for the sake of some ill-defined \"unity\" at a later date. Solidarity was the bridge by which different groups of people could connect on the basis of mutual understanding, respect, and the old socialist edict that an injury to one was an injury to all. It was mind-blowing!\n\nTo be honest, I didn't know what to do with the Combahee Statement. It was so unlike anything I had ever read before in politics, and it clashed so violently with what I had come to believe about feminism and \"identity politics\" that I did not know how to integrate it into my activism. I had to put it away.\n\nThe Combahee River Collective formed in Boston, in 1974, during a period that regularly produced organizations that claimed the mantle of radical or revolutionary struggle. The group broke from the Boston chapter of the National Black Feminist Organization, and named themselves after a daring Union Army raid, led by Harriet Tubman, to liberate seven hundred and fifty enslaved people in South Carolina. A few years ago, Barbara Smith told me that she and her comrades believed that, by naming the group after the Combahee River Raid, they were both honoring Harriet Tubman and indicating that liberation required political action.\n\nThe women of the C.R.C. drew on their experiences in Black, male-dominated organizations. Demita Frazier had been a member of the Black Panther Party in Chicago, right up until the Chicago police helped to assassinate the Panther leader Fred Hampton, in 1969. More generally, Black men dominated the leadership of the organized Black left. As a result, many Black women felt shut out of directing those organizations, just as they felt that their experiences as Black women were ignored.\n\nThey fared no better in organizations led by white women, who, for the most part, could not understand how racism compounded the experiences of Black women, creating a new dimension of oppression. The overwhelming majority of Black women were working-class and were forced to labor both outside and inside their homes. But Black women who tried to utilize public welfare so that they could spend more time caring for their children were demonized as freeloaders, even as white women who chose to work at home were celebrated for prioritizing their families over personal ambition. In the reality of organizing, these tensions manifested themselves in white women's desire to focus their organizing on abortion rights, while Black feminists argued for the broader framework of reproductive justice, which included the struggle against forced sterilizations of Black and brown women. These were hardly doctrinaire disputes. The eugenics programs of the early twentieth century continued into the nineteen-seventies, as tens of thousands of women in the United States were subjected to sterilization procedures without their informed consent.\n\nThe class and race tensions within feminism lasted far beyond the seventies. When I reached college, in the nineties, these same debates could be found animating women's-studies classes. In my Intro to Women's Studies class, one white woman, who said she was from Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, chafed at what she described as the \"divisiveness\" of Black feminism. After all, weren't we all women? To clarify, the woman said she was as much in solidarity with the women who cleaned her home as she was with white middle-class women like herself, who had also been trained to lower their horizons and expect less out of life. Apparently, the sisterhood was powerful.\n\nThe Combahee Statement was anything but divisive. It celebrated the possibilities of a political coalition born out of solidarity among groups who recognized the need to be engaged in struggle. In this way,  the C.R.C. pioneered the notion of \"identity politics,\" perhaps one of the most controversial and misunderstood terms in all of U.S. politics. In the statement, the authors described \"the concept of identity politics\" in the following way: \"We believe that the most profound and potentially most radical politics come directly out of our own identity, as opposed to working to end somebody else's oppression. In the case of Black women this is a particularly repugnant, dangerous, threatening, and therefore revolutionary concept because it is obvious from looking at all the political movements that have preceded us that anyone is more worthy of liberation than ourselves. We reject pedestals, queenhood, and walking ten paces behind. To be recognized as human, levelly human, is enough.\"\n\nI recently spoke with Barbara Smith, who made clear that \"identity politics\" was not intended to be exclusionary or to contend that only those who suffered a particular oppression could fight against it or even comment on it. \"We were not being reductive, we were not being separatists,\" she said. \"Combahee was never separatist.\" This would, of course, have been a rejection of the solidarity at the heart of the C.R.C.'s politics. Instead, they argued that Black women-and all oppressed people-had the right to form their own political agendas, because no one else would. Smith told me, \"By 'identity politics,' we meant simply this: we have a right as Black women in the nineteen-seventies to formulate our own political agendas.\" She went on, \"We don't have to leave out the fact that we are women, we do not have to leave out the fact that we are Black. We don't have to do white feminism, we don't have to do patriarchal Black nationalism-we don't have to do those things. We can obviously create a politics that is absolutely aligned with our own experiences as Black women-in other words, with our identities. That's what we meant by 'identity politics,' that we have a right. And, trust me, very few people agreed that we did have that right in the nineteen-seventies. So we asserted it anyway.\"\n\nAny concept, once it is released into the world, can take on new meanings when confronted with new problems. Identity politics has become so untethered from its original usage that it has lost much of its original explanatory power. In its earliest iteration, Black feminism was assumed to be radical because the class position of Black women, overwhelmingly, was at the bottom of society. But the civil-rights revolution and concerted efforts by the political establishment created a different reality for a small number of African-Americans. Today, there is a small but influential Black political class-a Black élite and what could be described as the aspirational Black middle class-whose members continue to be constrained by racial discrimination and inequality but who hold the promise that a better life is possible in the United States. They stand in contrast to the Black poor and working class, who live in veritable police states, with low-wage work, poor health care, substandard and expensive housing, and an acute sense of insecurity.\n\nMore than a fifth of Black women live below the poverty line, but their lives are largely invisible. Instead, popular culture and mainstream media outlets are fixated on Oprah Winfrey, Beyoncé Knowles, and Michelle Obama, to whom they turn for insights into the experiences of Black women. Much of what is meant by identity politics in its contemporary idiom is simply representation-the presence of Black, queer, gendered, and classed bodies with almost no attention paid to their political commitments. But the radicality of Black women's politics was based on their position at the bottom. The view is decidedly different from the top. The C.R.C. gave us the political tools to understand the difference between bottom-up and top-down politics, and their distorted manifestation in the identity politics of today.\n\nWhen I came back to the Combahee Statement, in the aftermath of the Ferguson uprising , I saw that its politics had the potential to make a way out of what felt like no way. But then I understood it differently, not just as a critical document in the canon of feminist literature or as a much-needed exposition of the origins of Black feminism. Instead, I read it as a powerful intervention for the left as a whole. In a political moment when futile arguments claimed to pit race against class, and identity politics against mass movements, the C.R.C. showed how to understand the relationship between race, class, and gender through the actual experiences of Black women. As the statement read:\n\nWe need to articulate the real class situation of persons who are not merely raceless, sexless workers, but for whom racial and sexual oppression are significant determinants in their working/economic lives. Although we are in essential agreement with Marx's theory as it applied to the very specific economic relationships he analyzed, we know that his analysis must be extended further in order for us to understand our specific economic situation as Black women.\n\nBlack women were at the helm of the growing Black Lives Matter movement, and they, too, were gravitating to the politics of the C.R.C. Smith told me, \"Many of the people in the Movement for Black Lives absolutely acknowledge that they are inspired by the politics of the Combahee River Collective and by the feminism of women of color, not just Black women.\" She was thinking of Audre Lorde, June Jordan, and Cheryl Clarke, and of the pioneering Chicana activists Cherríe Moraga and Gloria Anzaldúa. As Smith put it, \"These people were looking at the situation and saying, 'What we have here is not working. We need to think about things in a different way.' And who better to do that than feminists of color who are queer and on the left?\" She added, \"One of the signs to me that feminist-of-color politics are influencing this moment is the multiracial, multiethnic diversity-and not just racial and ethnic, but every kind of diversity-of the people who are in the streets now. That's right out of the Black feminist playbook.\"\n\nIn 2016, as the fortieth anniversary of the Combahee Statement approached, I realized that it would be an opportunity to draw attention back to the document and its astounding prescience and analysis, and to complicate a stilted and unsatisfying national discussion about who the real inheritors were of socialist politics in the United States. At that time, when I first thought of collecting an oral history of the Combahee River Collective, which became the book \" How We Get Free ,\" Senator Bernie Sanders was in the thick of a contentious Democratic Presidential primary. A good portion of the tension was generated by wild and unfounded assertions that socialism and the spoils of social democracy were only of interest to white people. I kept coming back to the C.R.C.'s basic claim:\n\nWe realize that the liberation of all oppressed peoples necessitates the destruction of the political-economic systems of capitalism and imperialism as well as patriarchy. We are socialists because we believe that work must be organized for the collective benefit of those who do the work and create the products, and not for the profit of the bosses. Material resources must be equally distributed among those who create these resources. We are not convinced, however, that a socialist revolution that is not also a feminist and anti-racist revolution will guarantee our liberation.\n\nNo one had the right to strip socialism and its rootedness in collectivity, democracy, and human fulfillment from Black women, or the Black radical tradition. The claims that socialism was for white people were an affront to a long lineage of Black communists and socialists here in the United States. Black Americans have always been drawn to radical and revolutionary politics as a salve for the diseased wound of racial oppression and the poverty and misery it creates. If lynchings, police brutality, and rat-infested housing were the best that American democracy could offer Black Americans, then how bad could communism or socialism really be?\n\nToday, in the midst of the greatest wave of protest and social upheaval in more than a generation, books about racism, policing, and the Black Lives Matter movement top best-seller lists. Instinctively, many of us turn to history as a way to grasp some frame of reference. I myself have found the Combahee Statement more compelling than ever. The C.R.C. connected the exploitative tendency of capitalism to a range of oppressions that kept apart those with the most interest in coming together. They envisioned coalition politics on the basis of mutual solidarity, including a commitment to the struggles against sexism, heterosexism, racism, class oppression, exploitation, and imperialism. These were, in their view, the preconditions for a mass movement in which no one's issues were left behind.\n\nAfter the C.R.C. disbanded, in 1980, Barbara Smith went on to play a critical role in the establishment of women's studies in colleges and universities, as well as in publishing. She founded the legendary Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press, with Audre Lorde, in 1980. Smith served on the Albany city council from 2006 to 2013, and later worked in the Albany mayor's office on issues related to inequality. During the 2020 Democratic Presidential primary, she served as a surrogate for Bernie Sanders. Smith is skeptical about the longevity of this particular moment, as she has earned the right to be. Will it turn into something more lasting than a frustrated outburst from those at the bottom? But her caution also betrays the hope and deep desire for radical change that all revolutionaries harbor. Smith told me, \"I'm not convinced that, despite the millions of people who are out in the streets expressing that they are done with things as they are-I'm not convinced that that translates into a movement. We now have language, we have an analysis of what's going on with the prison-industrial complex, with mass incarceration, with police brutality, with extrajudicial murders-we have that, and we have bases of operation, because there are definitely Black Lives Matter organizations in various cities around the country.\" She continued, \"But the question for me is: What's next? How do we mobilize all of this energy and actually bring about fundamental political, social, and economic change?\"\n\nOf course, what comes next will depend on what those who constitute the movement do. There are no maps or predetermined paths that guarantee the success or failure of a  movement. It is a living thing. But we can take inspiration from the imaginative optimism of the Combahee Statement. Many things have changed since the publication of the document, but many have not, and therein lies the problem that continues to pull people into the streets. The women of the C.R.C. believed that another world was possible, one in which Black women, and thus all of humanity, were freed from systems of oppression and exploitation, as the result of a collective struggle that reached down to the roots of the problems we face.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "6 myths about the history of Black people in America\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nSix historians weigh in on the biggest misconceptions about Black history, including the Tuskegee experiment and enslaved people's finances.\n\nby Jessica Machado and Karen Turner\n\nTo study American history is often an exercise in learning partial truths and patriotic fables. Textbooks and curricula throughout the country continue to center the white experience, with Black people often quarantined to a short section about slavery and quotes by Martin Luther King Jr. Many walk away from their high school history class - and through the world - with a severe lack of understanding of the history and perspective of Black people in America.\n\nLast summer, the New York Times's 1619 Project burst open a long-overdue conversation about how stories of Black Americans need to be told through the lens of Black Americans themselves. In this tradition, and in celebration of Black History Month, Vox has asked six Black scholars and historians about myths that perpetuate about Black history. Ultimately, understanding Black history is more than learning about the brutality and oppression Black people have endured - it's about the ways they have fought to survive and thrive in America.\n\nEnslaved people were money. Their bodies and labor were the capital that fueled the country's founding and wealth .\n\nBut many also had money. Enslaved people actively participated in the informal and formal market economy. They saved money earned from overwork, from hiring themselves out, and through independent economic activities with banks, local merchants, and their enslavers. Elizabeth Keckley , a skilled seamstress whose dresses for Abraham Lincoln's wife are displayed in Smithsonian museums, supported her enslaver's entire family and still earned enough to pay for her freedom.\n\nFree and enslaved market women dominated local marketplaces, including in Savannah and Charleston, controlling networks that crisscrossed the countryside. They ensured fresh supplies of fruits, vegetables, and eggs for the markets, as well as a steady flow of cash to enslaved people. Whites described these women as \"loose\" and \"disorderly\" to criticize their actions as unacceptable behavior for women, but white people of all classes depended on them for survival.\n\nIn fact, enslaved people also created financial institutions, especially mutual aid societies. Eliza Allen helped form at least three secret societies for women on her own and nearby plantations in Petersburg, Virginia. One of her societies, Sisters of Usefulness, could have had as many as two to three dozen members. Cities like Baltimore even passed laws against these societies - a sure sign of their popularity. Other cities reluctantly tolerated them, requiring that a white person be present at meetings. Enslaved people, however, found creative ways to conduct their societies under white people's noses. Often, the treasurer's ledger listed members by numbers so that, in case of discovery, members' identities remained protected.\n\nDuring the tumult of the Civil War, hundreds of thousands of Black people sought refuge behind Union lines. Most were impoverished, but a few managed to bring with them wealth they had stashed under beds, in private chests, and in other hiding places. After the war, Black people fought through the Southern Claims Commission for the return of the wealth Union and Confederate soldiers impounded or outright stole.\n\nGiven the resurgence of attention on reparations for slavery and the racial wealth gap , it is important to recall the long history of black people's engagement with the US economy - not just as property, but as savers, spenders, and small businesspeople.\n\nShennette Garrett-Scott is an associate professor of history and African American Studies at the University of Mississippi and the author of Banking on Freedom: Black Women in US Finance Before the New Deal .\n\nMuch is made about how colonial Black Americans - some free, some enslaved - fought during the American Revolution. Black revolutionary soldiers are usually called Black Patriots. But the term Patriot is reserved within revolutionary discourse to refer to the men of the 13 colonies who believed in the ideas expressed in the Declaration of Independence: that America should be an independent country, free from Britain. These persons were willing to fight for this cause, join the Continental Army, and, for their sacrifice, are forever considered Patriots. That's why the term Black Patriot is a myth - it infers that Black and white revolutionary soldiers fought for the same reasons.\n\nFirst off, Black revolutionary soldiers did not fight out of love for a country that enslaved and oppressed them. Black revolutionary soldiers were fighting for freedom - not for America, but for themselves and the race as a whole. In fact, the American Revolution is a case study of interest convergence. Interest convergence denotes that within racial states such as the 13 colonies, any progress made for Black people can only be made if that progress also benefits the dominant culture - in this case the liberation of the white colonists of America. In other words, colonists' enlistment of Black people was not out of some moral mandate, but based on manpower needs to win the war.\n\nIn 1775, Lord Dunmore, the royal governor of Virginia who wanted to quickly end the war, issued a proclamation to free enslaved Black people if they defected from the colonies and fought for the British army. In response, George Washington revised the policy that restricted Black persons (free or enslaved) from joining his Continental Army. His reversal was based in a convergence of his interests: competing with a growing British military, securing the slave economy, and increasing labor needs for the Continental Army. When enslaved persons left the plantation, this caused serious social and economic unrest in the colonies. These defections were encouragement for many white plantation owners to join the Patriotic cause even if they previously held reservations.\n\nWashington also saw other benefits in Black enlistment: White revolutionary soldiers only fought in three- to four-month increments and returned to their farms or plantation, but many Black soldiers could serve longer terms. The need for the Black soldier was essential for the war effort, and the need to win the war became greater than racial or racist ideology.\n\nInterests converged with those of Black revolutionary soldiers as well. Once the American colonies promised freedom, about a quarter of the Continental Army became Black; before that, more Black people defected to the British military for a chance to be free. Black revolutionary soldiers understood the stakes of the war and realized that they could also benefit and leave bondage. As historian Gary Nash has said, the Black revolutionary soldier \"can best be understood by realizing that his major loyalty was not to a place, not to a people, but to a principle.\"\n\nBlack people played a dual role - service with the American forces and fleeing to the British - both for freedom. The notion of the Black Patriot is a misused term. In many ways, while the majority of the whites were fighting in the American Revolution, Black revolutionary soldiers were fighting the \"African Americans' Revolution.\"\n\nLaGarrett King is an education professor at the University of Missouri Columbia and the founding director of the Carter Center for K-12 Black History Education.\n\nA dangerous myth that continues to haunt Black Americans is the belief that the government infected 600 Black men in Macon County, Alabama, with syphilis. This myth has created generations of African Americans with a healthy distrust of the American medical profession. While these men weren't injected with syphilis, their story does illuminate an important truth: America's medical past is steeped in racialized terror and the exploitation of Black bodies.\n\nThe Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male emerged from a study group formed in 1932 connected with the venereal disease section of the US Public Health Service. The purpose of the experiment was to test the impact of syphilis untreated and was conducted at what is now Tuskegee University, a historically Black university in Macon County, Alabama.\n\nThe 600 Black men in the experiment were not given syphilis. Instead, 399 men already had stages of the disease, and the 201 who did not served as a control group. Both groups were withheld from treatment of any kind for the 40 years they were observed. The men were subjected to humiliating and often painfully invasive tests and experiments including spinal taps.\n\nDeemed uneducated and impoverished sharecroppers, these men were lured by free medical examinations, hot meals, free treatment for minor injuries, rides to and from the hospital, and guaranteed burial stipends (up to $50) to be paid to their survivors. The study also did not occur in total secret, and several African American health workers and educators associated with the Tuskegee Institute assisted in the study.\n\nBy the end of the study in the summer of 1972, after a whistleblower exposed the story in national headlines, only 74 of the test subjects were still alive. From the original 399 infected men, 28 had died of syphilis, 100 others from related complications. Forty of the men's wives had been infected, and an estimated 19 of their children were born with congenital syphilis.\n\nAs a result of the case, the US Department of Health and Human Services established the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) in 1974 to oversee clinical trials. The case also solidified the idea of African Americans being cast and used as medical guinea pigs.\n\nAn unfortunate side effect of both the truth of medical racism and the myth of syphilis injection, however, is it tangibly reinforces the inability to place trust in the medical system for some African Americans who may not choose to seek out assistance, and as a result put themselves in danger.\n\nSowande Mustakeem is an associate professor of History and African & African American Studies at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nIt is well-known that African Americans faced the constant threat of ritualistic public executions by white mobs, unpunished attacks by individuals, and police brutality in Jim Crow America. But how they responded to this is a myth that persists. In an effort to find lawful ways to address such events, some Black people made legalistic appeals to convince police and civic leaders their rights and lives should be protected. Yet the crushing weight of a hostile criminal justice system and the rigidity of the color line often muted those petitions, leaving Black people vulnerable to more mistreatment and murder.\n\nIn the face of this violence, some African Americans prepared themselves physically and psychologically for the abuse they expected - and they fought back. Distressed by public racial violence and unwilling to accept it, many adhered to emerging ideologies of outright rebellion, particularly after the turn of the 20th century and the emergence of the \"New Negro.\" Urban, more educated than their parents, and often trained militarily, a generation coming of age following World War I sought to secure themselves in the only ways left. Many believed, as Marcus Garvey once told a Harlem audience, that Black folks would never gain freedom \"by praying for it.\"\n\nFor New Negroes, the comparatively tame efforts of groups like the NAACP were not urgent enough. Most notably, they defended themselves fiercely nationwide during the bloodshed of the Red Summer of 1919 when whites attacked African Americans in multiple cities across the country. Whites may have initiated most race riots in the early Jim Crow era, but some also happened as Black people rejected the limitations placed on their life, leisure, and labor, and when they refused to fold under the weight of white supremacy. The magnitude of racial and state violence often came down upon Black people who defended themselves from police and citizens, but that did not stop some from sparking personal and collective insurrections.\n\nDouglas J. Flowe is an assistant professor of history at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nThe bodies of people of color have a pernicious history of total exploitation and criminalization in the US. Like total war, total exploitation enlists and mobilizes the resources of mainstream society to obliterate the resources and infrastructure of the vulnerable. This has been done to Black people through a robust prison industrial complex that feeds on their vilification, incarceration, disenfranchisement, and erasure. And the crack epidemic of the late 1980s and '90s is a clear example of this cycle.\n\nEven though more white people reported using crack more than Black people in a 1991 National Institute on Drug Abuse survey, Black people were sentenced for crack offenses eight times more than whites. Meanwhile, there was a corresponding cocaine epidemic in white suburbs and college campuses that compelled the US to install harsher penalties for crack than for cocaine. For example, in 1986, before the enactment of federal mandatory minimum sentencing for crack cocaine offenses, the average federal drug sentence for African Americans was 11 percent higher than for whites. Four years later, the average federal drug sentence for African Americans was 49 percent higher .\n\nEven through the '90s and beyond, the media and supposed liberal allies, like Hillary Clinton, designated Black children and teens as drug-dealing \"superpredators\" to mostly white audiences. The criminalization of people of color during the crack epidemic made mainstream white Americans comfortable knowing that this was a contained black-on-black problem.\n\nIt also left white America unprepared to deal with the approach of the opioid epidemic, which is often a white-on-white crime whose dealers will evade prison (see: the Sacklers , the billionaire family behind Oxycontin who has served no jail time; and Johnson & Johnson , which got a $107 million break in fines when it was found liable for marketing practices that led to thousands of overdose deaths). Unlike Black Americans who are sent to prison, these white dealers retain their right to vote, lobby, and hold on to their wealth .\n\nJason Allen is a public historian and facilitator at xCHANGEs, a cultural diversity and inclusion training consultancy.\n\nOne of the biggest myths about the history of Black people in America is that all were enslaved until the Emancipation Proclamation, or Juneteenth Day.\n\nIn reality, free Black and Black-white biracial communities existed in states such as Louisiana, Maryland, Virginia, and Ohio well before abolition. For example, Anthony Johnson, named Antonio the Negro on the 1625 census, was listed on this document as a servant. By 1640, he and his wife owned and managed a large plot of land in Virginia.\n\nSome enslaved Africans were able to sell their labor or craftsmanship to others, thereby earning enough money to purchase their freedom. Such was the case for Richard Allen, who paid for his freedom in 1786 and co-founded the African Methodist Episcopal Church less than a decade later. After the American Revolutionary War, Robert Carter III committed the largest manumission - or freeing of slaves - before Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, freeing his 100 enslaved Africans.\n\nNot all emancipations were large. Individuals or families were sometimes freed upon the death of their enslaver and his family. And many escaped and lived free in the North or in Canada. Finally, there were generations of children born in free Black and biracial communities, many who never knew slavery.\n\nEventually, slave states established expulsion laws making residency there for free Black people illegal. Some filed petitions to remain near enslaved family members, while others moved West or North. And in the Northeast, many free Blacks formed benevolent organizations such as the Free African Union Society for support and in some cases repatriation.\n\nThe Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 - and the announcement of emancipation in Texas two years later - allowed millions of enslaved people to join the ranks of already free Black Americans.\n\nDale Allender is an associate professor at California State University Sacramento.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nApparently, we can't even trust these justices to follow their own very recent precedents.\n\nThe Court decided an identical case two years ago. But every voting rights case that reaches this Court is dangerous.\n\nAn expert on Black voting explains what's really happening with Black support for Donald Trump.\n\nThe acclaimed writer takes on another intractable problem.\n\nThe US has often singled out Haitian immigrants. GOP attacks are the latest example.\n\nPreliminary data shows a negative impact on Black enrollment at some universities.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC. All Rights Reserved"

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nLongstanding inequalities have led to the current wave of protests.\n\nby Sean Collins\n\nThe current protests - and the anger that fuels them - did not spring up out of nowhere. They are a cry of pain from a raw nerve that has always afflicted the United States, one that was all too often ignored.\n\nThat nerve had a number of causes, and a number of things exacerbating it: biased and violent policing, of course, but also lingering effects of segregation affecting education, job opportunities, and health; a multi-tiered wage system that gives white men greater financial rewards than others, most of all black women; a criminal justice system that is punitive if you are black but able to find forgiveness, mercy, and understanding if you are white; the sense that not just one's labor but one's life is less valuable than those of other citizens only because of the color of their skin.\n\nPeople marching in the streets have had enough of this injustice. They are demanding Americans no longer allow themselves to be policed as they have been . They are pulling down memorials to traitorous men who would still have them enslaved. They are calling for lynching to be made a federal crime . They want equal pay; they want political change. They want people to listen carefully, thoughtfully, and to be willing to change their hearts and behavior.\n\nA historic number of Americans are participating in these protests: According to the Pew Research Center , 6 percent of American adults have taken to the streets in recent weeks, a figure that translates to about 17 million people. Millions more who did not go out want to see real change, too. Recent data shows this - and how the country has reached this point - in the nine charts below.\n\nThe recent spate of police killings and well-documented police violence at largely peaceful protests - from students being dragged from a car in Atlanta, Georgia, to a 75-year-old man being pushed to the ground and left bleeding in Buffalo, New York - appear to have led Americans to have an increasingly negative view of police, according to a Democracy Fund/UCLA Nationscape poll of more than 6,000 Americans taken from May 28 to June 3.\n\nPollsters found that the percentage of Americans with an unfavorable impression of police rose from 18 percent in their May 21-27 survey to 31 percent in its May 28-June 3 poll. The polling for both weeks had a 2.2 percentage point margin of error, meaning either number could be 2.2 percentage points higher or lower than was officially recorded.\n\nRegardless, that increase suggests the American public's perception of law enforcement has begun to more closely mirror the sentiment of black Americans, who even before the recent protests and killings expressed notable skepticism about police.\n\nFor instance, in a Pew Research Center study conducted from April 20 to 26 - about a month before George Floyd was killed - 10,139 American adults were asked for their thoughts on police, and researchers received starkly different answers based on ethnicity.\n\nMost Americans have high confidence in police, the study found - except for black Americans. With a 1.5 percentage point margin of error, 56 percent of black Americans said they had a great deal or fair amount of confidence in police, compared to the 78 percent of white Americans who said the same. And confidence was even lower among young black Americans - 49 percent said they had a great or fair amount of confidence in police.\n\nSome of that lack of confidence appears to come from a belief that police officers are unethical - 48 percent of black Americans see officers' ethical standards as being low or very low, Pew found.\n\nMany other polls have also captured this lack of trust - for instance, a Washington Post/Ipsos poll taken from January 2 to 8 of 1,088 black Americans (with a 3.5 percentage point margin of error) found that 83 percent said they didn't trust police \"to treat people of all races equally.\" Only 14 percent said they did trust police to do so.\n\nThe situation has not improved.\n\nA recent Yahoo News/YouGov poll, taken May 29 and 30 - four days after Floyd was killed - of 1,060 US adults (with a 4.3 percentage point margin of error) found that 94 percent of black Americans believe the criminal justice system treats white Americans better. The same poll found that 91 percent of black Americans don't believe white and black people receive equal treatment from the police. A Monmouth University study (conducted from May 29 to June 1, of 759 US adults, with a 3.6 percentage point margin of error) found that 87 percent of black Americans believe police are more likely to use excessive force against black people.\n\nMore recent work from Pew , a survey conducted from June 4 to 10 of 9,654 US adults, with a 1.5 percentage point margin of error, found that the majority of black men - 64 percent - say they have been stopped unfairly by police.\n\nThe sum of all these studies is that there just isn't trust in police among black Americans - certainly not to the degree there is among white Americans. And one important reason for that is fear: of violence, of unfair treatment, of death.\n\nThis general lack of trust has long been undergirded by a pervasive tension, one illustrated in video broadcast on Los Angeles's Fox 11 , in which police responding to property seizures at black businesses arrived at the scene and began to detain the business owners rather than those in breach of the law.\n\nIt's a tension that lies in unpredictability - in knowing that any interaction with police can quickly escalate into an unfair, traumatic, and even life-ending event. It's why Ta-Nahisi Coates recently told Vox's Ezra Klein he was leery of calling the police when there were fights in his family's neighborhood. Perhaps the police would come and make peace. But perhaps they would detain the wrong people, as happened in Los Angeles, or even pursue a course of action that left someone dead, as was the case with George Floyd.\n\nThe tension created by this uncertainty was reflected in the May 29-30 YouGov survey, which found that the sight of a police officer makes 60 percent of black Americans feel \"less secure.\" About one-third - 22 percent - of white Americans said the same, while 32 percent of white Americans said the sight of an officer makes them feel more secure, a sentiment shared by only 5 percent of black Americans.\n\nPart of the reason for this is the specter of death police carry for black Americans. A much-cited study by researchers at Rutgers University, the University of Michigan, and Washington University in St. Louis, explained by Vox's Dylan Scott , found that black men have a 1-in-1,000 chance of being killed by police. For no black American is that statistic abstract. Nor is it, increasingly, for other Americans: Since Floyd's death, the public has learned of the killings of Javier Ambler , Maurice Gordon , Manuel Ellis , Tony McDade , Momodou Lamin Sisay , Rayshard Brooks , and many others.\n\nThere is also fear not just over killing but over racially motivated harassment and detention. The YouGov work found that 43 percent of black Americans say they have been treated unfairly by police, and the Monmouth study found that 44 percent of black Americans felt they or a family member had been harassed by police, compared to 24 percent of white Americans who said the same.\n\nMonmouth's study also found the majority of black Americans - 87 percent - believe that police are more likely to use excessive force against black people, a sentiment white Americans agreed with, though not by an overwhelming margin; 49 percent of white Americans said police were more likely to use excessive force against black people, while 39 percent felt the use of force wasn't tied to race.\n\nIn addition to the fear, tension, and uncertainty comes a sort of pessimistic cynicism - the sense that if one is the victim of police violence or misconduct, nothing will happen. There was surprise over the speed at which Derek Chauvin, the former police officer who killed Floyd, was arrested: just four days after Floyd was killed. Arrests of those officers who kill rarely come that quickly, if at all - it took nearly a month for the Baltimore officers involved in Freddie Gray's death , and more than four years for former St. Louis officer Jason Stockley to be arrested for killing Anthony Lamar Smith.\n\nAn analysis by the advocacy group Mapping Police Violence found that 99 percent of police killings from 2014 to 2019 did not result in officers being charged with, let alone convicted of, a crime. And that is for those who kill - a situation that would seem to leave little recourse for those who've suffered excessive force or were arbitrarily detained.\n\nBlack Americans feel this keenly, according to YouGov's polling. When asked whether police are usually held accountable for misconduct, 82 percent of black respondents said no, compared to the 52 percent of white people, 48 percent of Latinx respondents, and 63 percent of those of other ethnicities who said the same.\n\nAnd Monmouth's polling suggests black Americans are forced to face their anxieties and fears around policing more often that other Americans - and in stressful situations. The university's pollsters asked if an officer had ever kept respondents (or their families) safe in a \"dangerous situation.\" Across ethnicities, most said police had not; but 41 percent of black Americans said they'd been protected by police, compared to 33 percent of white Americans - a number that, coupled with the survey's other findings, would seem to suggest that being protected by police has not outweighed the negative perceptions black Americans have of police due to concerns about being victims of violence or unfair treatment.\n\nThere is a deep and multifaceted problem with how police interact with black Americans - but the issues they face, and those the protests concern, go beyond law enforcement: They are systemic, involving government, health, and economics.\n\nPolling reflects this.\n\nAn Axios/Ipsos poll taken from May 29 to June 1 of 1,033 American adults (with a 3.1-3.4 percentage point margin of error) found only 18 percent of black Americans trust the federal government to work for their interests; 67 percent feel Congress is doing a bad job, according to Monmouth's polling.\n\nResults like these come amid a pandemic that has disproportionately affected black, Latinx, and Native Americans - one that the federal government, particularly the executive branch, has struggled to respond to.\n\nThrough the end of May, black Americans were hospitalized for Covid-19 at 4.5 times the rate of white Americans, according to data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (adjusted to account for differences in age distributions among each ethnic population). While the CDC's data set is not yet complete - it has ethnicity information for about 79.9 percent of cases - current numbers show only Native Americans have been hospitalized at rates greater than black Americans.\n\nBlack Americans face a disproportionately higher rate of hospitalizations, as well as a disproportionately higher rate of death. While black Americans make up about 13 percent of the US population , the CDC estimates they account for 23 percent of all Covid-19 deaths, as of June 3. White Americans, on the other hand, make up about 76 percent of the US population , but account for 53.2 percent of coronavirus deaths, according to the CDC.\n\nAnalysis by the nonpartisan study group APM Research Lab of all coronavirus deaths in 43 US states and Washington, DC, found that more than 25,028 black Americans died of Covid-19 before June 9 - meaning one in 1,625 black Americans has died of the disease. By comparison, one in 3,800 white Americans has died. According to the group's analysis, if black Americans died of Covid-19 at the same rate as white Americans, more than 14,000 black people who died after being infected by the coronavirus would be alive today.\n\nLess severe cases also disproportionately affect black Americans. Analyzing data collected through June 9, the CDC found that black people make up 22.1 percent of all US coronavirus cases. Black Americans are more likely to know someone who has died of Covid-19 than white Americans - an analysis by the NORC Centers for Public Affairs Research found that 11 percent of black Americans have had a family member or close friend die of the disease, compared to 4 percent of white Americans.\n\nThe AP's Kat Stafford and Hannah Fingerhut note that this disparity is even greater in cities and states that faced particularly high case counts, like Birmingham, Alabama, where 15 percent of black adults had a close friend or family member die, compared to 2 percent of white adults.\n\nRegardless of the severity or outcome, Covid-19 represents a health and economic burden for many - particularly black Americans.\n\nWhile coronavirus testing is usually free, any hospitalizations or emergency room visits related to coronavirus care are not. Covid-19-related hospital stays for an insured person could exceed $1,300, with some patients having to pay more than $20,000, according to research by the Peterson Center on Healthcare and the Kaiser Family Foundation . An analysis from FAIR Health , a nonprofit focused on the cost of care, found that those without insurance - as about 11.5 percent of black Americans were in 2018 - can expect to pay between $42,486 and $74,310.\n\nEnd-of-life services are also very expensive, with the National Funeral Directors Association putting the median cost of a funeral in 2019 at $7,640.\n\nUnexpected costs like these would be financially ruinous for most Americans at the best of times. A SSRS/Bankrate poll conducted in January (with a 3.39 percent margin of error) found that 59 percent of Americans would be unable to cover a $1,000 emergency, for instance. And even if one has a mild case of Covid-19, the need to quarantine can have taxing financial consequences.\n\nAll these costs come as black Americans - who, generally, have always been less secure financially than white Americans - are in a more precarious financial situation than ever.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic comes amid the larger backdrop of a racial income and wealth gap.\n\nIpsos's polling found that 33 percent of black Americans said they are in dire financial straits at the moment, nearly double the number of white Americans who reported the same - 18 percent.\n\nPew polling has captured a similar struggle, and one that is ongoing, finding that 46 percent of black Americans struggle to pay their bills in a typical month and that 48 percent reported having difficulties in April. The number of black Americans found to have bill difficulties was nearly double the number of Latinx Americans - 28 percent - and 2.3 times the number of white Americans, at 20 percent.\n\nSome of this disparity stems from the fact that there are gross inequalities in pay by ethnicity. Data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that in the first quarter of 2020, the median pay for a black male worker between the ages of 25 and 54 was $891 per week; for a Latino man of the same age, it was $796 a week. Meanwhile, a white man of the same age averaged $1,128 per week. Women of all three racial groups made less than the average white man, with white women making $906, black women making $767, and Latina women making $701.\n\nThis difference that extends to those classified as essential workers - a group that, according to an analysis by the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), is about 15 percent black. And it is one that is particularly evident in high risk essential jobs like health care. EPI's work found that a white health care worker's median hourly wages were $7.96 more than a black health care worker's.\n\nThe pay gaps are a reminder that being an essential worker was not enough for equal pay in normal times, and equal pay still has not appeared as these jobs became potentially life-threatening - and potentially resource-draining, again, given the costs of care and lost wages caused by infection. Overall, these wage gaps are indicative of a poor economic reality that black Americans have had to endure for centuries, and that has been a source of stress, with millions under constant concern about paying their bills.\n\nMuch has been made of the better-than-expected jobs report released at the beginning of June - after record contractions, the Department of Labor reported that the economy added 2.5 million jobs in May.\n\nThe fact that there is still 13.3 percent unemployment - roughly 20.9 million people - was ignored by many, including President Donald Trump , who said the report was \"an affirmation of all the work we've been doing\" and \"a great day for [George Floyd], it's a great day for everybody.\"\n\nBut while it is good news that some Americans got their jobs back, that good news didn't reflect everybody, particularly black Americans. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , black unemployment increased slightly from April to May, up 0.1 percentage points (87,000 people), as did Asian American unemployment, which rose 0.5 percent (55,000 people).\n\nMuch of the growth in May was driven instead by increases in white employment, which increased by 2 million; Latinx Americans accounted for most of the other new jobs - 286,000.\n\nBlack Americans' exclusion from economic gains is nothing new. In January, when the unemployment rate was 3.6 percent, the black unemployment rate was 6 percent; there were about 5.9 million unemployed people, 1.2 million - or 21 percent - of whom were black. There was a similar disparity between the general unemployment and black unemployment rates in June 2019 of 2.3 percentage points; 2.5 percentage points in June 2018 ; 3.7 percentage points in June 2008 ; and in the first half of 1988 , 6.8 percent.\n\nAll this suggests that even once the economy returns to normal, it will still be a poor economy for black workers. And if the recession triggered by the pandemic mirrors the Great Recession, unemployment numbers for black Americans won't return to that 6 percent level anytime soon. As an analysis by American Progress's Christian E. Weller notes, \"The decline in prime-age employment rates associated with the Great Recession started two months sooner for African Americans than whites and lasted 15 months longer than it did for white workers.\"\n\nOne reason the unemployment numbers for black Americans tend to be higher, Weller points out, is that it takes unemployed black Americans about five more weeks, on average, to find work than white Americans, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers.\n\nThat means more time being unemployed, and more time having to survive off the depressed income unemployment insurance provides. And when it comes to unemployment, the wage gaps discussed previously begin to affect even those who are unemployed or furloughed.\n\nUnemployment benefits (not counting the temporary $600 per unemployment check provided by the CARES Act) are calculated based on one's former weekly earnings. This means preexisting wage gaps have only exacerbated inequality at a particularly trying time, as black Americans can expect to receive smaller unemployment benefits on average than white Americans.\n\nThe US Federal Reserve shows that unemployed black Americans have less wealth and fewer resources to leverage during lean times, and that they have struggled with debt even during good economic times.\n\nThe Fed's data on US household wealth shows there is no measure by which Americans of color come anywhere close to the wealth owned by white Americans - a paradigm that has held for centuries. In the final quarter of 2019, white Americans held 84.2 percent of US assets; black Americans held 4.8 percent. White Americans hold 85.5 percent of the country's net worth; black Americans, 4.2 percent.\n\nAnd black Americans' wealth is not concentrated in leverageable assets. For most Americans, homes are a source of wealth. But a 2019 report by the National Association of Real Estate Brokers (NAREB) found that 40.6 percent of black households owned homes in the second quarter of 2019, 0.3 percentage points lower than the level of black homeownership following the 1968 passage of the Fair Housing Act.\n\nThose who do own homes often own property that is less valuable for being in a black community. Andre M. Perry, a fellow in the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution, told Vox's Aaron Ross Coleman that his group's research found that \"after controlling for education, crime, walkability, and many other metrics you might find on Zillow, homes in black neighborhoods are devalued by 23 percent. About $48,000 per home, about $156 billion in lost equity.\" And even getting those undervalued homes can be a struggle - the NAREB study found that black applicants looking for home loans were denied at twice the rate of white applicants.\n\nThose who do get loans are likely to have more difficulty paying them off than their white counterparts, because, again, black Americans make less than white Americans of their same education and skill levels. Younger black Americans, in particular, have other debt burdens draining their income, in part because their families had less wealth to begin with.\n\nLow familial wealth means black college-goers take out more in student loans than white students; data collected by New America's Wesley Whistle found that in 2016, 84 percent of black college-goers took out student loans, compared to 67 percent of white students.\n\nNot only did most black college-goers have these loans, but even before the current economic downturn, they had trouble staying current with their payments. In 2018, the Federal Reserve found that 28 percent of black Americans ages 18 to 29 with student loans had fallen behind on their payments, as had 15 percent of Latinx college students in the same age range. By comparison, 7 percent of white 18- to 29-year-olds with debt were behind.\n\nAll this is a reminder that there are chronic and interconnected factors that exclude black Americans from the benefits of a strong economy, and cause them more anguish than Americans of other ethnicities - particularly white Americans - when times are bad. And although they are so tangled that it is difficult to tell precisely where one economic issue begins and another ends, it is clear they all have one source: the systemic racism that has devalued black labor for more than four centuries and the social injustices that have stemmed from it.\n\nFor decades, it felt as though black Americans lived in a different reality, and one that went largely unacknowledged.\n\nBut the worlds black Americans and other Americans live in seem like they are beginning to converge, in large part due to the recent killings of black people - particularly the killing of George Floyd, which 70 percent of Americans had watched by May 30, according to YouGov's polling.\n\nFollowing those killings, there has been an increasingly broad understanding that something is not quite right about American life - and that racial inequality is to blame.\n\nAccording to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll - taken of 1,000 registered voters from May 28 to June 2, with a 3.1 percentage point margin of error - 80 percent of the country believes things in the US are out of control. YouGov's pollsters found that 57 percent of Americans believe race relations are \"generally bad\" in the US; 45 percent believe they have gotten worse; and 61 percent of Americans said police killings are signs of a larger problem.\n\nA Democracy Fund/UCLA Nationscape poll of more than 6,000 Americans taken from May 28 to June 3, with a 2.2 percentage point margin of error, found that 96 percent of Americans believe black Americans face racial discrimination. And 62 percent of those said black Americans face a lot or a great deal of discrimination - a figure that jumped 12 percentage points from the survey taken May 21 to 27, suggesting that the protests have played an important role in reshaping the country's perception of the injustices black Americans face. As of June 10, more than two-thirds - 67 percent - of Americans now support the Black Lives Matter movement, according to Pew.\n\nUnderstanding historical and underlying issues has led to the protests around the country being seen as right. Pew's June polling found that 65 percent believe the protests are the result of \"longstanding concerns about the treatment of black people.\" The WSJ/NBC poll found that 59 percent of Americans believe the killing of Floyd to be a bigger issue than even violent protests, and Monmouth's polling - taken during a time when there was much coverage of people at the protests seizing property and committing violent acts - found that 54 percent of Americans believed the protests themselves to be justified, and that 78 percent felt the anger behind the protests was justified.\n\nMore recent polling from the Washington Post/George Mason University (taken from June 2 to 7, of 1,006 US adults, with a 3.5 percentage point margin of error) found this level of support to be sustained: 74 percent of Americans support the protests - and 90 percent of Americans do not blame the protesters for any violence that occurred during recent uprisings.\n\nWith this support has come a rapid desire to see change. The Democracy Fund/UCLA Nationscape poll found that the percentage of Americans with an unfavorable view of police increased 13 percentage points between May 21-27 and May 28-June 3. The Washington Post/George Mason poll found that 81 percent of Americans believe the police need to make changes to ensure all Americans are treated equally by law enforcement. And that feeling that something needs to be altered goes beyond just the police: The Post poll captured a desire for leadership that can help \"address the nation's racial divisions\" - 62 percent of Americans said they want this. Monmouth's polling, meanwhile, found that 74 percent of Americans believe the country is on the wrong track.\n\nThese results help illuminate why there is such broad support for the protesters. It is not only those who march who believe the US is on the wrong track, and that radical changes are needed in policing, political leadership, and the ways people of color are treated.\n\nPoliticians have begun to acknowledge this, from the Minneapolis City Council announcing it will restructure the city's police department to House Democrats unveiling a broad police reform bill .

But that's not really what stops her. \"Most of my peers are white,\" she says, \"and I get very angry about the systemic inequality evident in our situations, and their seeming obliviousness to it.\"\n\nDee's family has been middle-class and college-educated going back three generations, \"since Black people reasonably could be,\" she says. Her maternal grandparents were the children of sharecroppers in the South, migrated north as adults, got graduate degrees, and, unlike millions of Black Americans who were unable to secure mortgages at the time due to racist housing covenants and lending practices, bought a home.\n\nHomeownership was, and remains, the beating heart of wealth accumulation for the American middle class. Our society privileges homeowners in everything from the tax code to the availability of home equity lines to membership requirements for neighborhood associations. You buy a place, that place grows in value, and either you trade up to a bigger place or you keep it until you can pass it down to your kids or your kids get the money from its sale. Stability gives birth to even more stability.\n\nThat's not what happened with Dee's family. \"My grandparents were bludgeoned every time the economy took a downturn,\" Dee recalls, in part because of the legacy of redlining and the devaluation of property in Black neighborhoods. \"They ended up losing their house. They had enough to live on, but no wealth.\" The same happened to her parents. She says they were \"destroyed\" by the 2008 housing crisis, which disproportionately affected Black homeowners, many of whom, because of longstanding discriminatory lending practices, believed subprime mortgages were the best financing option available to them. Dee's grandparents managed to make ends meet, but their retirement savings were drastically diminished, and they'll eventually require some subsidization from Dee.\n\n\"Having everything 'right' and still living with precarity, literally living paycheck to paycheck, is deeply upsetting\"\n\nBut Dee, 41, has been struggling for years to find something approximating financial security in her own life. She lives in the Hudson Valley, north of New York City, with her partner and two kids. She and her partner make around $200,000 a year. At more than three times the national median household income, this sounds like a big number, but every month, they found their resources depleted. Before the pandemic, they were allocating most of their money toward their mortgage, child care, and student loans. They'd been putting money into their kids' 529 college savings accounts, but otherwise the focus has been on credit card and student loan debt, which they've just started to be able to actually pay off. These days, they're no longer paying expensive child care bills, but there's a real threat that Dee's partner's job could disappear at any moment, at which point they would immediately start drowning in debt.\n\nDee describes herself as frustrated and so very, very angry. \"Having everything 'right' and still living with precarity, literally living paycheck to paycheck, is deeply upsetting,\" she says. Which is why her extra income is going toward her kids' college savings: to prevent them starting their lives already behind, the way she feels she did. The hole Dee dug in search of middle-class stability for her family is so deep that she'd realistically need to double, even triple her income to pull herself out and have enough to stabilize her parents as well.\n\nShe doesn't have a ton of hope that will happen. \"I live in America,\" she says. \"There is no support for middle-class families, and there is no targeted support for those who have suffered from systemic racism. It's getting harder and harder to maintain a middle-class life.\"\n\nDee's story is illustrative of just how different the hollowing of the middle class can feel, depending on your race and family history. Unlike many white middle-class Americans who find themselves bewildered by the prospect of going financially backward from their parents, Dee watched as her family's best-laid plans for a steady, middle-class future were foiled, again and again, by economic catastrophes in which losses were disproportionately absorbed by Black Americans.\n\nAs economists William Darity Jr., Fenaba Addo, and Imari Smith recently explained , \"for Black Americans, the issue may not be restoring its middle class, but constructing a robust middle class in the first place.\" For families like Dee's, the stability of the middle class has always been a mirage. And you can't hollow out what's never actually existed.\n\nA foundational myth of the American dream is the potential of the individual, wholly unbound by context. Parental income level, race, education, access to resources as a child, health, location - positive or negative - all become incidental. The idea is that in America, land of opportunity, you excel on your own merits.\n\nThis is a lie, of course. When we talk about class status in America, we still largely focus on current status instead of intergenerational familial legacy; on income, rather than our access to wealth, which \"serves as a reservoir that a family can tap into when its income flow is disrupted,\" according to economist Ngina Chiteji. Wealth can absorb the blow of a recession, a lost job, or a medical catastrophe. Family wealth makes it easier for future generations to buy homes, and makes it less likely that they'll accumulate debt. If Dee's grandparents and parents hadn't been so thoroughly destabilized by various recessions, her student debt load might be significantly lower or nonexistent today.\n\nWealth begets wealth. It makes it easier to launch a business or take a career risk. It's correlated with better health outcomes, lower child mortality, longer life expectancy: everything you'd expect from a solid home life and access to health care. Because of intersecting racist policies and practices - redlining, continued segregation in schools , hyper-surveillance and brutality by law enforcement, and the policing of Black bodies , just to start - wealth has been far more difficult for Black Americans to accumulate.\n\nIn 2016, the median net wealth for white families was $171,000. For Black families, it was $17,000. Black people currently hold less than 3 percent of the nation's total wealth, even though they make up 14 percent of the population. In 2002, the typical white child's grandparents' net worth was eight times bigger than the average Black child's. Take away home equity, and 93 percent of white children's grandparents have positive wealth. That's only true for 73 percent of Black children's grandparents. Even when Black Americans reach an income level that situates them in the middle class, there's still a matrix of discriminatory systems that make it difficult for them to gain the stability - the wealth - that theoretically accompanies middle-class existence.\n\nJasmyne, 29, works for a nonprofit in Los Angeles. She grew up in the South and attended the same HBCU as her husband, a first-generation college student who now works in STEM. Together, they pull in $192,000 a year, which, according to the Pew middle-class calculator , places them in the upper echelon of incomes in the area. But Jasmyne believes placing her, or anyone else, within a particular class is tricky.\n\n\"I consider anything above the average US salary to be middle class, but with a whole slew of caveats,\" she says. \"For example, my husband and I earn middle-class salaries, but we also have significant student debt and often have to support family. We live in an expensive city, so what seems high [for housing costs] in our hometowns is pretty average here. He is saving for retirement, but I haven't even begun.\"\n\nUntil very recently, Jasmyne's mother lived with them; she'd tapped out her retirement savings, so Jasmyne and her husband helped cover her bills while she got financially secure. \"I only know of one other couple that has had to navigate that under the age of 30,\" Jasmyne says, \"and we will likely have to revisit that living arrangement as she ages.\"\n\nPart of Jasmyne and her husband's burden is shared by hundreds of thousands of other millennials and Gen X-ers, regardless of race, who have found themselves providing a safety net for their parents. But that need is not evenly distributed across the middle class. In the mid-2000s, 36 percent of middle-class Black people had a parent living below the poverty line, as opposed to only 8 percent of the white middle class; according to one 2006 study , Black middle-class Americans are 2.6 times more likely to have a low-income sibling than those in the white middle class. People in situations like Jasmyne's have a higher probability of becoming the primary source for the \"reservoir\" of stability for their extended family - which in turn makes it more difficult to save, or invest, or set up the financial infrastructure that will ensure that you won't need help from your children later in life.\n\nThere's no room to mess up, no room for catastrophe\n\nKeisha, who's 33 and lives in Atlanta with her husband, expressed something similar. As an IT specialist in the transportation field, she makes around $95,000, and her husband brings in $50,000. She was the first person in her family to go to college, and currently pays $450 a month in student loan debt. The other big monthly payments in their lives are $2,000 on their mortgage and $1,500 toward paying down their credit card debt. They're saving very little every month, usually somewhere between $50 and $100.\n\nIn many ways, Keisha thinks her situation is similar to her parents': Growing up, her family was always \"comfortable,\" but with \"the feeling that if income stops, then that would change very quickly.\" The difference, Keisha says, is that her parents had a much larger support network - and they were making less money. \"It was understandable for them to need help occasionally, as opposed to myself and my spouse, who don't have children and make higher salaries. I feel like people in my situation are held to a different standard.\" There's no room to mess up, no room for catastrophe. It's hard to knit your own social safety net when you're the safety net for so many other people as well. (This is also true of many immigrant families - something this series will address in the months to come.)\n\nIf you focus on an individual's finances, it's easy to isolate and judge bad decisions: They shouldn't have taken out that loan or relied on that credit card or filed for bankruptcy. In my first article on the hollow middle class , I opened with the story of Delia - a middle-class teacher in New Jersey, covering her parents' bills and struggling to put money aside in part because she was still paying for both of her daughters to attend private school. Delia explained why private school felt so important to her: She saw it as her girls' ticket out of their small hometown, a place where she felt trapped by the financial ramifications of her parents' bad decisions. Readers were incredibly antagonistic toward that choice. One man went so far as to send me a 2,000-word breakdown of all that was wrong with how Delia was spending her money. \"There was no comments section on the piece,\" he wrote, \"but she needs to know.\"\n\nKeisha feels anxious and stressed about money, particularly about her debt, every day. She doesn't feel comfortable talking to her peers about it, so she turns to online forums for support and commiseration. \"It's embarrassing to be in a bad financial situation,\" she says. \"Even if you can explain away why or how you got into the situation, talking about it still invites extra judgment that you're somehow irresponsible or that you've mismanaged your money, instead of talking about the things that are outside of your control.\"\n\nA middle-class salary does not exclude Black Americans from higher stress levels than white Americans in their same income bracket, or a higher likelihood of incarceration\n\nThis attitude is wrong when it comes to any person's financial situation, but it's particularly wrong when it comes to a person who's part of a group that's been historically and systematically marginalized. As sociologists Melvin Oliver and Thomas Shapiro contend in their groundbreaking examination of Black and white wealth disparities in America , the legacy of chattel slavery - low wages, segregation, poor schooling - has \"sedimentized\" racial inequality. Within that hierarchy, Black wealth falls to the bottom, while explicit and implicit modes of white privilege keep white wealth buoyed to the top.\n\nDarity, Addo, and Smith argue that the Black middle class is best understood as \"a subaltern middle class.\" Its members may be economically privileged among Black communities, but no amount of money can insulate them from marginalization or the everyday exhaustion of navigating America as a Black person. The authors point to wide-ranging data that underlines as much: A middle-class salary does not exclude Black Americans from higher stress levels than white Americans in their same income bracket, or a higher likelihood of incarceration. If you're a Black woman with a graduate degree, the chances that your baby will die as an infant are higher than for a white woman without a high school degree. And the more educated you are, the more racism you're likely to encounter in the workplace.\n\nDealing with that racism? Combating it, confronting it, attempting to hedge against it? It can cost a lot of money. In Black Privilege: Modern Middle-Class Blacks With Credentials and Cash to Spend , sociologist Cassi Pittman Claytor interviewed dozens of members of what she calls the \"modern Black middle class.\" One of these interviewees, Sharon, grew up in a tony suburb, attended an elite college, and works as an advertising account manager pulling in somewhere between $75,000 and $99,000 a year. But whenever she tries to consume in accordance with her income level, she's surveilled. As she tells Claytor, \"Because I'm black, they think I'm going to steal something.\"\n\nFor some, countering stores' racist surveillance means, well, buying things. Cultivating relationships with salespeople, becoming valuable customers. Proving, again and again, that they are middle-class - an assumption that is granted without a second thought to most white customers. Tasha, who works as an attorney, tells Claytor that she tries to subvert the problem by opening store credit cards. \"I can be like, 'I'm a cardholder, I've been a loyal customer since whatever year. ... Like I've always shopped here.' You can pull up my card savings. You see the amount of money I spend.\"\n\nThat's a ton of purchases just to be taken seriously as a Black consumer, and even then, people might think you're buying what you can't afford or that you're careless with money. Keisha, the IT specialist, tells me that an appliance in her home recently broke down, so she called a company for repairs. Instead of telling her the price, they quoted her the monthly payment for financing. \"I'm not sure if that assumption was based on our race or the poor state of the appliance, which hadn't been serviced in several years, but I'm always wondering in the back of my mind: Is it because I'm Black that you're making this assumption?\"\n\nAs a result, Keisha often finds herself overcompensating. \"Instead of saying to the repairman, 'You're right, I cannot afford this $3,000 repair, I'd like to hear about your financing,' I end up posturing as if I can absolutely afford it and asking for the total price.\" She hates it, but she also wants to disabuse people of whatever negative image they might have of Black people. \"It's like the stereotype that Black people don't tip. Even if the service was terrible, I never tip below 25 percent,\" Keisha says.\n\nMany of Claytor's interviewees - who work in fields ranging from the arts to finance - are the only Black employee, or one of a handful of Black employees, in their workplaces. The burden of representation falls on them, and they police their own appearances accordingly, often at significant cost. \"Jackie Robinson syndrome,\" in which Black employees feel they must groom and conduct themselves as exemplars, runs rampant: \"For the sake of their careers, they try to be more 'put together' than their white counterparts and take far more care of their appearance,\" Claytor writes. \"They describe wearing dress pants when their white colleagues are wearing khakis. While they are sure to wear clothing that is always clean and pressed, they describe white colleagues as wearing clothes that are wrinkled and have holes.\"\n\nIt takes a lot of racial privilege to wear whatever you want in the workplace. It also costs a significant amount of money - and time and concern and stress - to counteract others' preconceptions. Darryl, a bank associate, tells Claytor that he developed a secondary, unspoken dress code for himself. He shaved off his goatee, and because he'd chosen to keep his hair in cornrows, he felt the need to dress in a way that offset it: always \"neat\" and \"nice.\" His white coworkers might come in with \"some dingy-ass, dirty-ass t-shirt, or a sweater with a hole in it\" - an unthinkable option for a Black man in so many workplaces.\n\nSeveral women in Black Privilege describe straightening their hair instead of wearing braids, to decrease the likelihood, in one woman's words, of looking \"too quote-unquote ethnic and angry black woman, Black Power-esque.\" Tasha, the woman who developed the strategy of shopping places where she'd opened up a line of credit, worked in a firm where the majority of employees were white women. She was always vigilant - in attitude and appearance - to never give her employers a reason to avoid hiring Black women in the future. Vigilance is exhausting. It breaks the body down . And it's yet another invisible cost for members of the Black middle class to bear.\n\n\"What is often not acknowledged is that the same social system that fosters the accumulation of private wealth for many whites denies it to blacks,\" Oliver and Shapiro wrote back in 1995, \"thus forgiving an intimate connection between white wealth accumulation and black poverty.\"\n\nRecall Dee's frustration and disinclination to talk about her own money problems with her white peers: It's hard to have a conversation about wealth when the mechanisms, policies, and societal practices that may have helped one family maintain stability were used to prevent another family from ever achieving it. Not because they weren't as hardworking, not because they were \"worse with money,\" but simply because they were Black.\n\nWhen we talk about the middle class, we have to be precise about which part of the middle class we're talking about. I didn't do that as well as I should have in the first piece in this series; I wanted to use subsequent pieces to dive deeper, but that was a poor excuse. In introductions, in headlines , in tweets, and in conversations with friends, we should be specific. Over the past 40 years, the middle class has hollowed out for white Americans, undercutting the foundation of the belief system so many expected to inherit as their own. That is a categorically different experience from reaching the middle class and realizing just how much work and time and diligence and luck it will take for others like you, even your someday children, to reach that same point.\n\nIt's hard to have a conversation about wealth when the mechanisms, policies, and societal practices that may have helped one family maintain stability were used to prevent another family from ever achieving it\n\nIt's not just that so many white Americans were born on third base, as the old saying goes, and think they hit a triple. It's that they don't understand that for centuries, Black Americans were not even allowed in the ballpark. Worse than that, they were treated as tools of the game that is American capitalism, never the beneficiaries. When they were begrudgingly allowed on the playing field, they were hobbled, again and again. Called cheaters, given bad calls, left with the worst equipment, all but a small section of the stands rooting against them.\n\nIf, as a Black American, you somehow managed to distinguish yourself, the understanding was that it only happened because someone let you on the field when another player was actually better. Other players were powerful enough that they could help their kids get on the team, even if they're not that talented. Your kid could be a superstar, and still, she has to go through everything you went through, deal with all the same bullshit, beat all the same opponents, just because she's a Black kid. The game is rigged against you: actively invested in keeping those in power still in power. It's a bad baseball analogy, but baseball is as American as you can get.\n\nSo how do you actually fix that game? You can acknowledge that reparations , whether in the form of lump payments, preferential lending terms, universal free college, or any other number of potential iterations , are not radical. They are a recognition of historical, enduring inequality, economic and otherwise, and an attempt to restore a modicum of the stability systematically denied to Black families.\n\nFor the middle class as a whole to solidify, Congress and the Biden administration will have to dramatically rethink the costs, from child care to higher education, that are pulling families out of the middle class and into debt, and preventing millions of others from reaching the middle class in the first place. But unless they want that solidified middle class to be a white echo of what it was before, reparations must be a part of that solution.\n\nThis is more true than ever amid the Covid-19 pandemic: Black people are more likely to work in \"essential\" jobs, but also more likely to work in industries that cut or laid off workers during the pandemic. Last month alone, 154,000 Black women dropped out of the job force while white women actually gained jobs. More than one out of every 750 Black Americans has died of Covid-19, and Black people have died from the disease at 1.5 times the rate of white people. A Johns Hopkins study from August showed that Black people have nearly double the infection rate of white people, a statistic for which the full implications are still coming into focus as we learn more about the long-term effects of the disease.\n\nAs Nikole Hannah-Jones wrote for New York Times Magazine last summer following the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery , \"race-neutral policies simply will not address the depth of disadvantages faced by people this country once believed were chattel. Financial restitution cannot end racism, of course, but it can certainly mitigate racism's most devastating effects. If we do nothing, black Americans may never recover from this pandemic, and they will certainly never know the equality the nation has promised.\"\n\nOne of the simplest arguments for reparations, I found on Reddit. \"Reparations isn't free money to blacks,\" one user wrote. \"It's a bill owed to blacks.\" For slavery, and the economy that was built upon it. For World War II, and the benefits the vast majority of Black GIs did not receive for it. For redlining, and all the home equity lost because of it. For police brutality and mass incarceration and Covid-19, and all the time and life and promise they have stolen. The tab goes on for so long that it's impossible to imagine its end. That doesn't mean it doesn't need to be paid. Quite the opposite: It means it must be.\n\nIf you'd like to share your experience as part of the hollow middle class with The Goods, email annehelenpetersen@vox.com or fill out this form .\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nTrade wars are easy to win - if you're China.\n\n﻿From Dunkin' deodorant to Sabrina Carpenter perfume, smelling good isn't enough - it's all about smelling edible.\n\nThe latest on the trade war.\n\nGold has become a rare safe bet in Trump's economy.\n\nBusinesses and consumers are already appearing to panic.\n\nThe Democratic Party faces an electoral math problem post-Trump.

We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nVox analyzed dozens of studies and found that racism adds up in insidious ways.\n\nby Sean Collins and Izzie Ramirez\n\nData visualization by Alvin Chang for Vox and Capital B\n\nPart of the discrimination issue of The Highlight . This story was produced in partnership with Capital B .\n\nAfter a long search, Keisha Orr - a human resources manager working on Wall Street in the early 2000s - believed she had found the perfect candidate for a job at her financial tech company. The applicant had it all: an ambitious resume, a decorated educational career, and poise. Keisha asked her supervisor and the hiring manager to move the candidate to the next round. They bristled.\n\nEven though the client service position didn't require a degree, the hiring manager told Orr that the candidate wasn't eligible because he hadn't finished college, never mind that he was a college senior a few months away from completing his bachelor's at New York University. Orr couldn't help but wonder whether the resistance was because the potential hire was Black.\n\n\"It was almost like I was cosigning for him in some ways,\" Orr, who is a Black woman, told Vox. \"No one we had interviewed even held a candle to him. It was very baffling and mind-blowing to me.\"\n\nThanks to Orr's persistence, the candidate was eventually hired, staying with the company for years. Yet she's never gotten over the sense of angst that she might be held responsible if he didn't meet expectations. Only now, 20 years later, does Keisha recognize that what happened was discriminatory.\n\nWhen something is as ubiquitous as discrimination, it becomes familiar, and what is familiar quickly becomes so ordinary as to be almost imperceptible. That's why discrimination is regularly dismissed, even by those whom it affects the most. The hurdle for Keisha and others has long been that it's often hard to prove.\n\nOur collaboration launched with a comprehensive look at Juneteenth as it became the nation's newest federal holiday. You can read the entire discrimination package here .\n\nDecades' worth of discrimination studies collected by researchers at the University of Chicago and shared with Vox, however, spotlight how common experiences like Keisha's really are. In the face of denials from many white Americans that systemic racism exists, the myriad studies provide tangible proof that it is, in fact, pervasive, affecting many areas of life.\n\n\"The thing we were surprised by was after George Floyd, there was this debate about, 'I don't know, is discrimination really systematic?'\" said Devin Pope, a professor of behavioral science and economics and one of the University of Chicago researchers who set out to compile the data. \"We're like, wait, people don't realize that this is a closed topic? The evidence is overwhelming that Black Americans get treated differently than white Americans in so many points of their lives.\"\n\nResearch around discrimination in America continues to grow and capture attention. There are the big examples: Black people dying needlessly while giving birth , receiving smaller paychecks than their white colleagues , being excluded from certain neighborhoods and all the amenities and opportunities they provide. Discrimination steals their health, degrading their cells through a process known as weathering. It makes the American dream of embracing the freedom of the open road a nightmare. It prevents folks from accessing quality health care . It is buried in the code that powers the digital world. Each of those circumstances comes with its own anxiety and angst.\n\nThe studies provided to Vox by the University of Chicago researchers - Pope, Oeindrila Dube, and Sendhil Mullainathan - illuminate the everyday experiences: having emails go unanswered , having trouble getting help in public , being undertreated when in pain . Those quotidian tasks make up the average American's day, yet when tainted by racism, they can make daily life for Black Americans more difficult, with myriad repercussions.\n\nVox's review of more than 40 studies, which were conducted over nearly 50 years, animates a reality that any Black American could expound upon at length, offering a view into what discrimination snatches from individual Black Americans every day of their lives. It's one thing to know that racism exists; that it has made life more challenging in both hidden and obvious ways and has not meaningfully improved in the last few decades . It's another to see those experiences boldly affirmed in reams of data, to have tangible proof that what you think you're experiencing isn't just in your head, and that it is systemic and endemic.\n\nThe research used various methodologies (including correspondence studies , field experiments , statistical analyses , and review studies ) and were conducted in a range of locations from North Carolina to Chicago to Seattle , looking at a range of ages and class divides. (The University of Chicago researchers worked on some of the studies; others informed their own work.) They all drew the same, insidious conclusion: Anti-Black discrimination practiced by Americans, white and otherwise, routinely robs Black people of opportunity, money, health, safety, and dignity.\n\nBlack life isn't just unfairly strenuous; it's also artificially short. The National Center for Health Statistics projects that the average life span for a Black American is 70.8 years. The projection for a white American? 76.4 years. That gap makes time all the more of the essence for Black people.\n\nYet anti-Black discrimination wastes their time - a lot of it.\n\nVox analyzed the data from the studies to provide an expansive picture of just how much. We learned that the average Black American could lose years, if not decades, of their life to discrimination.\n\nThe studies collected by Pope and his colleagues, as well as a breadth of other research, contain countless examples of this time-stealing phenomenon. Black Americans have to wait days longer for an appointment with a new doctor . They must be prepared to wait one day longer for a response for information about joining a new church and have to send out twice as many emails to get a response from a potential roommate . They spend more time applying for mortgages , and they see more Uber rides canceled - the list goes on.\n\nOrr is just one example. She lost time - to worry, sleepless nights, and nerve-racking conversations with leadership - that she could have spent advancing her career or taking care of herself and her family.\n\nA longer wait time doesn't necessarily mean racism. Yet Black Americans feel negative consequences even from potentially discriminatory actions, the studies showed.\n\n\"The minute you point out what you think or feel, it's 'You're playing the race card' and it immediately diminishes what is a reality,\" said Henrika McCoy, a professor of social work at the University of Texas at Austin who researches equity in mental health for Black males and writes about institutional racism. \"Racism is not about intent. Racism is about power to implement the prejudice that you have, but it's also about the outcome.\"\n\nA 2015 study by Tara Goddard, Kimberly Barsamian Kahn, and Arlie Adkins contains a particularly acute example of the irrelevance of intent. They measured the time it took for cars to stop for Black and white pedestrians at a crosswalk without a signal in Portland, Oregon. The researchers found that Black pedestrians had to wait an extra 2.4 seconds to cross the street on average.\n\nWhat is 2.4 seconds? Ephemera, seven blinks . But what if you are an average Black American and you live to age 70.8? What if you cross the street once a day? Then you've spent about 17.16 hours longer waiting to cross the street than you would have if you were white. That's more than a full waking day of your life taken by discrimination.\n\nSay you're a civic-minded Black American and you never miss an election. A 2022 study by M. Keith Chen, Kareem Haggag, Pope, and Ryne Rohla used smartphone location data and neighborhood demographics information to track wait times in voting lines across the US for the 2016 presidential election . They found that Black Americans living in majority-Black areas have to wait longer to vote, sometimes more than 30 minutes. How long depends on where you live, but on average, wait times in areas with all Black residents were 5.23 minutes longer than in areas with no Black residents. Across a lifetime of elections, that can add up to about more than an hour waiting in line.\n\n\"If everything takes you 15 minutes more, now you've got less time with your kids, you have less time at work, you have less sleep,\" Chen told Vox. \"It adds up.\"\n\nEven fun can be tainted. Trinity Alicia, a 23-year-old living in Boston, recalled an evening she spent at a Cambridge bar. It was an unfamiliar space: Everyone was older and white. Her friends were busy, and so she'd come alone.\n\n\"The bartender just was like, 'You know, you can get a drink somewhere else,'\" Alicia said. \"He definitely served other people that came to the bar after me. And I was wondering, like, 'What is this?' I was confused because I hadn't had a hidden discrimination experience like that before.\"\n\nDeflated, Alicia went home. She'd spent time getting ready, commuting, trying to get the bartender's attention. Four hours of her life. Vaporized.\n\nOne could argue that a few lost hours at a bar aren't the end of the world. Stolen hours quickly become days and years, however, and that time tariff becomes far more significant in important areas like housing, finances, and employment.\n\nThe wage disparity between Black and white Americans is well documented : Black people in this country persistently make less than white people. Black women make less than their male peers and face a double discriminatory tariff, due to both race and sex. An Economic Policy Institute analysis found that in 2022, the average white employee made $34.49 an hour, while the average Black employee made $25.61 - a difference of $8.88, or nearly 30 percent. This can mean the difference between having food on the table, emergency savings money, a 401(k), and student loan debt paid, or not.\n\nThe discrepancy means that Black time - that same time stolen by discrimination - is worth markedly less than white time: 43 cents per minute versus 57 cents. To make up the pay gap caused by discrimination, a Black worker must toil an extra 2.7 hours each day. Over the course of a career (assuming one starts working at 22 and retires at 65), that's the equivalent of 3.4 years of extra work - years that the worker could have spent with their family or friends, or frittering away any way they wanted.\n\nThe time tariff affects many other areas of employment, too. In a seminal 2004 study, Mullainathan, collaborating with Marianne Bertrand , found that Black Americans needed an extra eight years of experience to receive the same number of interview requests as a white American of equal qualifications. In the eyes of recruiters, that makes a 22-year-old white job seeker from Princeton University looking for employment in the financial sector equivalent to a 30-year-old Black Princeton graduate who started working in the industry right out of college.\n\nAs many wealthy Black Americans have noted, money is no aegis against racism . In fact, scholars Stephen Holt and Katie Vinopal analyzed data from the American Time Use Survey, which tracks how people in the US ages 15 and older use their time. They found that while poorer Black Americans and poorer white Americans spent roughly the same amount of time waiting for goods and services in an average day, wealthy Black Americans spent 26 more minutes than their equally moneyed white counterparts waiting; that's 1.3 years wasted.\n\nDiscrimination as it exists today is sustained by the interlocking gears of history, white supremacy, white nationalism, sexism, and classism. To destroy discrimination, one must first obliterate its component parts. There's not always societal or political will to do so. It can also be hard to constantly acknowledge the presence of discrimination and its emotional toll.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we live in a society where, in order to be successful as a person of color, especially as a Black person, you have to move past [discrimination], because if you don't, you'll probably never get anything done,\" said McCoy, the social work professor.\n\nPlus, Valerie Wilson, director of the Economic Policy Institute's program on race, ethnicity, and the economy , points out, it's a huge burden for an individual to prove discrimination. \"The system currently is set up in a way that you have to have the experience of discrimination before anything happens,\" she said, \"as opposed to us putting more resources and energy into preventing it or limiting opportunities for it to happen in the first place.\"\n\nAt the same time, the large body of existing discrimination research can be used to slowly chip away at the issues discrimination causes, several of the researchers Vox interviewed said. It can be effectively used to support arguments in lawsuits, for instance - and has been, perhaps most famously in Brown v. Board of Education , in which the plaintiffs relied on an experiment known as the \"Doll Test\" to advance their arguments. In closed rooms, where bureaucracy relies on data, these studies provide evidence.\n\nThere is no easy solution to the problems discrimination causes, no easy way to get back the time it saps. \"We have to get creative,\" said Seft Hunter, the director of Black-led organizing and power-building at the DC-based nonprofit Community Change Action. \"We know there are folks who are just happy not knowing what's happening, because then they're not in a position to have to confront what it means to see these disparities play out uninterrupted all across the country.\" Purloined time becomes yet another issue our eyes gloss over, something bad that's part of the normal fabric of the everyday.\n\nThat's what makes discrimination so frustrating. It is deadly, expensive, tiring, and dehumanizing. It's also a complete waste of time.\n\nSean Collins is a news editor with Vox's politics and policy team.

And Barry, their Cavalier King Charles spaniel , watches along. It's an added layer of protection against the pressure that McWoods feels contributed to her 69-year-old mother's death in January from pancreatic cancer.\n\nAs her mother battled the disease, McWoods picked up the book Inflamed: Deep Medicine and the Anatomy of Injustice by Rupa Marya and Raj Patel.\n\nIt wasn't long after she cracked it open that she had to close the cover, leaving pages unread. In the book, the authors outlined how racism intertwined with the surge in inflammatory diseases like gastrointestinal disorders and asthma. They unpacked how the air we breathe, the food we eat, and the inability to escape racial violence bleed into medical illness. Too close to home, she thought.\n\nWhat she read was part of a larger concept introduced decades ago, called \"weathering,\" which refers to the idea that the constant stress of living in an unjust society contributes to poor health outcomes in marginalized communities. It's like a rock being slowly eroded by the outdoor elements, surviving the storms as the force repeatedly chips away at its strength. Around the time Arline Geronimus, now a public health researcher at the University of Michigan, coined the term \"weathering,\" Dr. Camara Phyllis Jones was digging into the accelerated aging hypothesis. Jones attributes the pervasive health disparities to the stress hormones that are elevated when Black Americans endure racism, and as a result some people's bodies age prematurely.\n\nThese ideas outline the forces that have contributed to historically dismal health disparities, from maternal mortality to heart disease and cancer.\n\n\"The impacts of racism are why we see what we see,\" says Jones, a family physician and past president of the American Public Health Association. \"Racism is foundational in our nation's history, and yet many people are in staunch denial of its continued existence and profoundly negative impacts on the health and well-being of our nation.\"\n\nIt's as though Black people have tightened their ab muscles, bracing for a gut punch but never relieving the pressure. They sleep knowing they have to do it all over again. A car constantly revving its engine. Tiny paper cuts that, over time, destructively multiply. A body living in an unbroken cycle of fight or flight.\n\nMcWoods's mom felt it.\n\nIn the neighborhood where she grew up in Chicago, the average life expectancy was lower than in the wealthier white areas of town, much like the community where McWoods now lives in Northern California. Stress was high, she says, and her mother was consistently on high alert.\n\n\"I know for a fact that is what played a role in her health outcome,\" McWoods says.\n\nAcross the San Francisco Bay Area, like much of the country, those with higher incomes and more wealth live longer compared with those who earn less, one report shows . The poorest neighborhoods tend to have the largest concentration of Black residents. And as a result, they have the lowest life expectancy.\n\nSegregation influences health. Policies that affect housing, education, income, homeownership, and employment have a profound impact on residents' physical and mental well-being. And how racism is embedded within those social structures and institutions disturbs the health of Black Americans.\n\nThis discrimination outside of medical spaces also trickles into health care settings, where Black patients are more likely to be dismissed and treated with racist algorithms and insufficient technology . The cumulative burden of chronic stress, referred to as allostatic load, wears down the body.\n\n\"That's how it kills you,\" said Dr. Tony Iton, a senior vice president at the California Endowment. \"That's how racism gets under your skin and kills you.\"\n\nIt all culminates in Black Americans being at higher risk for heart disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes, asthma, homicide, and myriad other health issues, compared with others. California data shows that, even among the wealthy, childbirth is deadlier for Black women.\n\n\"Just being Black makes you tired,\" said Dr. Michael LeNoir, an Oakland-based allergist and pediatrician. \"We're the only population that probably does not benefit health-wise from increasing your socioeconomic status.\"\n\nExperts say the disparity is due, in large part, to structural racism, which is about the opportunities people are afforded - or not afforded - by race. That can include the quality of schools that people are able to attend; the availability of safe, green, open-air parks or neighborhoods free of pollution; and water free of lead. It also involves the consistent exposure to explicit discrimination and the stress of processing microaggressions in majority-white spaces.\n\n\"It doesn't just so happen that people of color in this country are overrepresented in poverty while white people in this country are overrepresented in wealth,\" Jones says. \"For each group, there's some initial historical injustice that is perpetuated today.\"\n\nThe effects of policies like redlining and \"separate but equal\" schooling often ripple into bleak health outcomes for Black Americans. The disparities aren't as much due to genetic or biological differences, but rather attributable to structural disadvantages associated with race in this country. Continued exposure to emotional strain raises the level of the stress-related hormone cortisol in people's bodies, therefore affecting inflammation and disease rates.\n\n\"There's nothing intrinsic in us,\" says Jones. \"There's a lot happening to us.\"\n\nIn the Bay Area, many Black folks have found themselves stuck within a more covert form of racism than what their families fled the Deep South to escape. And it's bleeding into their health outcomes.\n\nBakari Olatunji has been vegan since 1980, he says, motivated in part by what he saw his family going through. He lost his mother to colon cancer. His dad died of a stroke. His older brother's liver failed. Bullets killed his younger brother.\n\nSince 2022, Vox has partnered with the Black-led nonprofit newsroom Capital B to publish inclusive, rigorous journalism for our audiences.\n\nOur collaboration launched with a comprehensive look at Juneteenth as it became the nation's newest federal holiday. You can read the entire discrimination package here .\n\n\"When I look at the death of my mother and father, I see colonization,\" the 68-year-old says. When he was asked if the stress of being Black played a role in the death of his loved ones, Olatunji's answer was clear.\n\n\"How can it not?\"\n\nHis parents moved the family from Shreveport, Louisiana, to the West Coast when he was 6 years old in an effort to shield their babies from the racism they refused to talk about. But they couldn't escape it. There were the white people at the clothing store in Hayward, California, who told Olatunji and his brother they didn't serve \"their kind\" there. And, years later, the cops who pulled him over and said he fit the description of someone who had robbed a local shop.\n\n\"It's worse out here because people let their guards down,\" Olatunji says.\n\nHe has lived in Oakland for 60 years, and believes the homelessness and poverty Black folks are facing are worse now than ever before. He credits his good health to his veganism.\n\n\"It's hard for me to live a good life and not be stressed.\"\n\nLike Olatunji's family, Ben Darden fled blatant racism in Houston. In 1952, he moved to stay with an uncle and go to college. At the University of California Berkeley, he was one of a few Black students among thousands, he said.\n\nHe experienced racism but didn't know what to do about it. \"Down there, it's direct,\" the 88-year-old says. \"Out here, they just don't embrace you.\"\n\nDarden's inability to find a job despite a top-notch education was what angered him most. Some of his Black friends ended up working at the toll booths, he recalls. \"There was not a chance, even with an education.\"\n\nThere wasn't much to do about his anger, he says, except sit it in. As he recounted his life, he was waving a sign that read, \"HONK FOR PEACE,\" on the corner of International Boulevard and 98th Avenue in Oakland. It was a Friday evening in April, and a small crowd was protesting gun violence in the community. The sky melted orange as the sun set. Darden was double-masked underneath his KN95.\n\nAlthough he's not convinced stress played a role in his high blood pressure, prostate issues, and kidney problems, weathering and the accelerated age hypothesis may explain a piece of his story.\n\nTheir impacts may be \"hard for us to realize because we live it from the cradle to the grave,\" LeNoir says. \"It is so insidious at times that we don't recognize the pressure that is on each of us.\"\n\nAt 15 years old, Eric McDonnell's mother fled Mississippi to settle out West. The year was 1957, the same decade of the Brown v. Board of Education case , the Montgomery bus boycott, and the lynching of 14-year-old Emmett Till.\n\nThe decision to leave was about escaping the terror of the Deep South, as McDonnell puts it.\n\n\"It almost didn't matter what she found in San Francisco,\" he says.\n\nInstead of the brutality of the South, the family would battle a far more subtle - but acute - racism in California. One that would gradually wear on McDonnell's body over the years, the symptoms appearing in adulthood.\n\nIt was a steady stream of stress. There was his daily fear of living, moving. Existing. McDonnell, now chair of San Francisco's African American Reparations Advisory Committee, was on constant alert. How would the cops react to him on the street? What discriminatory expectations did his boss have of him as a Black man?\n\nHe couldn't escape the feeling that he was being hunted. Unsafe. Unprotected. He wondered who would be in each room he walked into, questioning if they valued his life. An all-consuming cloud of angst followed him.\n\nMcDonnell learned to suppress all that was weighing on him. He mastered the art of hushing the emotions that spiraled to the surface due to the stress. In some ways, he says, the high-functioning alcoholism perfected the practice.\n\nIt manifested in other ways, too. His blood pressure began to creep up, leading to a hypertension diagnosis about 10 years ago. When asked if he thought the stress of being Black affected his health, McDonnell did not hesitate. \"No question,\" he says. \"No question.\"\n\nHe is also battling Bell's palsy, a condition that leaves one side of the face weak. The doctors traced McDonnell's case back to stress. The left side of his face is temporarily paralyzed.\n\nSome years back, he lost a loved one to heart disease. Another to a brain aneurysm. It is hard to tie either scientifically to weathering, he says, but he wholeheartedly believes it affected their health outcomes.\n\nMcDonnell does not see his experience as unique, he says. \"To be Black is to be under duress.\"\n\nMcWoods, the therapist, sees it in her clients.\n\nSome are still fearful of local public transportation after the 2018 murder of Nia Wilson , a young Black woman who was stabbed as she was standing on a platform, in an unprovoked attack. Many more are navigating microaggressions in majority-white professional spaces, particularly in the Bay Area's tech industry, where young Black folks find that they are one of few. After George Floyd's murder, says McWoods, there was an expectation for them to still produce despite the mass grief and vicarious trauma they felt.\n\nHow could they maintain an intense pace of work while simultaneously not being understood? What emotions could they share with their colleagues? Will they be seen as too emotional? Incompetent?\n\nDiscrimination at work, one study found , is linked to increased risk of high blood pressure.\n\n\"African American health, if left to its own devices, is actually quite good,\" Iton says. \"It's the social pressures of racism and discrimination that lead to the weathering, and ultimately, the increase in chronic disease and premature death.\"\n\nThese days, McWoods tries her best to safeguard against racism's wrath. She wants to disrupt what it means to be a strong Black woman.\n\n\"I have seen a lot of strong Black women,\" she says, \"and I haven't seen their pace change.\"\n\nThat's why McWoods goes on walks, to break up the stress sitting inside her body, hoping the tightness will release, protecting her from the same illness that took her mother. That's the best treatment for the quiet, but dangerous, weight of racism.\n\nThe movement, the bubbles, the outdoors.\n\nMargo Snipe is the national health reporter at Capital B , where she covers issues affecting the mental and physical health of Black Americans, racial bias in medicine, and inequities in the American health care system.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nSwole of body, swole of mind.\n\nNothing will cure you of perfectionism faster than trying to grow living things.\n\nHow a day off can (and can't) help children.\n\nWhy early season heat waves are becoming more common and more dangerous.\n\nIt feels very tempting to cocoon myself in relaxing hobbies to spare my mental health.\n\nThe one allergy treatment to rule them all, explained.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nHere's what Trump has - and hasn't - done for Black communities in the past four years.\n\nby Fabiola Cineas\n\nAt last week's NBC town hall event , President Donald Trump leaned in to the camera to recite a statement that has become a fixture of his reelection campaign: \"I have done more for the African American community than any president with the exception of Abraham Lincoln .\"\n\nOver the past year, Trump has shouted this from the lectern at campaign rallies and from the balcony at the White House as a play to Black voters, a countermessage to his racist rhetoric. The phrase has morphed over time, starting in the fall of 2019 as something more restrained - \"We've done more for African Americans in three years than the broken Washington establishment has done in more than 30 years\" - and rising to the bold \"No president has done more for our Black community\" this year.\n\nIn June, Trump tweeted a similar statement bragging about what he has done for Black Americans. It came just days after George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, was killed by Minneapolis police officers, setting off unrest and protests for Black lives across the country. He had not actually addressed the reason for millions of people marching in the streets: the institutional racism in policing.\n\nThe tone-deaf display continued earlier this month, when in his first address since announcing he had tested positive for the coronavirus, Trump confidently shouted the claim to hundreds of Black and Latinx voters standing on the White House South Lawn: \"Nobody can dispute it. Nobody can dispute it. It's true. Nobody can dispute it.\" The very fact that the president encouraged Black people to assemble in his name just days after his diagnosis, forgoing social distancing and despite the devastation the virus has wrought on Black and Latinx communities, one could argue undermined his message.\n\nWhile Trump may be confident in his claim of having done the most for Black Americans, his record begs to differ. He has repeatedly cited his efforts on criminal justice reform and the economy as the reasons he's been the best president for Black America since Lincoln - who signed the Emancipation Proclamation, freeing enslaved people in the Confederacy, and clearing the way for the ratification of the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery across the US - but rarely does Trump put his supposed \"wins\" in context. For example, Trump often tries to take credit for a decline in violent crime, though the downward trend predates him by many years.\n\nTrump's \"since Lincoln\" bit is also untrue on its face: Ulysses S. Grant created the Department of Justice and pushed for the prosecution of the Ku Klux Klan; Franklin Delano Roosevelt's Justice Department pushed for poll tax repeal ; Harry S. Truman desegregated the military ; Lyndon B. Johnson through Great Society legislation signed the Voting Rights Act, the Civil Rights Act, and the Fair Housing Act, and desegregated hospitals in the South through the Social Security Act Amendments of 1965; and Barack Obama, the first Black president, passed the Affordable Care Act, which has reduced racial disparities in health care .\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has wholly disregarded how his strategy and policies don't help Black communities - from his rhetoric that sows division to his inaction in addressing the coronavirus pandemic that has killed nearly 1 in 1,000 Black people in the US.\n\nHere's a look at what Trump has and hasn't done for Black communities and why his campaign's recently released plan for Black America is a vague last-ditch effort to lock in Black voters.\n\nStanding before hundreds of Black and brown supporters earlier this month, Trump said that America has reached a \"historic reduction of violent crime\" during his presidency. \"We signed a landmark criminal justice reform bill that nobody thought was possible to think about. I did that. I did that. I got that done,\" he said.\n\nIn December 2018, Trump did indeed sign the First Step Act , which made \" the most substantial changes in a generation \" to \"tough on crime\" laws that increased the federal prison population by 700 percent since 1970 .\n\nSince Trump signed the measure into law, more than 3,000 people have been released from federal prison due to the law's \"good time credits,\" which provide early release for well-behaved inmates; hundreds have been released into the elderly home confinement pilot program, which places older federal inmates in home confinement before the end of their prison term; and more than 2,000 people - 91 percent of whom are Black - received sentencing reductions because the First Step Act retroactively applied the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (a law Obama passed), reducing the sentencing disparity between crack and cocaine charges.\n\nWhile these changes are substantial, many have pointed to the areas where the act fails - and why Trump can't take full credit for the initiative.\n\nAs Catherine Kim reported for Vox , Trump's Justice Department, under Attorney General Bill Barr's direction, has \"attempted to block hundreds of eligible beneficiaries\" from being released and has tried to send those who have been released back behind bars, according to the Sentencing Project . \"The department has tried to freeze applications or re-incarcerate former inmates by setting higher standards for their release ,\" Kim wrote.\n\nMoreover, Trump has failed to mention how the bill was the \"culmination of several years of congressional debate\" over how to reduce the size of the federal prison population and maintain public safety, according to the Congressional Research Service . The law is basically a scaled-down iteration of the Sentencing and Reform Corrections Act that was introduced in Congress in 2015.\n\nProponents of the law have also pointed out that its effects on the size of the federal prison system will ultimately be minimal. Vox's German Lopez reported :\n\nThe law may let thousands of federal inmates out early, but, as Stanford drug policy expert Keith Humphreys noted in the Washington Post , more than 1,700 people are released from prison every day already - so the First Step Act in one sense only equates to adding a few more days of typical releases to the year.\n\nWhile much of what Trump has touted did not originate with him, this summer he had the opportunity to create his own criminal justice agenda when protests swept the country over the police shootings of Black Americans like Breonna Taylor , the 26-year-old killed in her home in Louisville, Kentucky, and Jacob Blake , the 29-year-old who survived after police shot him in the back several times in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Instead, Trump claimed that the phrase \"Black lives matter\" is a symbol of hate and responded to the unrest by celebrating law enforcement, directing them to meet the protesters with force and violence.\n\nTrump's dismissal of the Black Lives Matter movement's repeated calls for police and criminal justice reform, coupled with his \"law and order\" rhetoric - rhetoric that incites violence and that has long been racist - counters the police reform efforts he touts. In June, Trump signed an executive order that called for more training for police officers and the establishment of a national database of police misconduct, among other actions - all steps that fall far short of the transformative changes that activists have called for .\n\nEarly on, Trump made his tone clear when he tweeted, \"When the looting starts the shooting starts,\" focusing on the small number of people ransacking property and giving very little attention to the families burdened by police violence.\n\nTrump has also tried to take credit for the reduction in violent crime nationwide, but he inherited the downward trend that has been in effect since 2000. Trump has tried to argue that because he expresses support for and honors police officers - supposedly unlike Obama - criminals have been less inclined to commit crimes. Yet researchers haven't been able to establish a link between rises in homicides and \"disrespect for the police.\" According to economists at the Brennan Center , by claiming that he is responsible for lower crime rates, Trump is promoting dangerous misconceptions about the relationship between crime and policing.\n\nTrump has repeatedly patted himself on the back for achieving \"the lowest Black and Hispanic unemployment rate in the history of our country.\"\n\nBefore the pandemic hit, the unemployment rate for Black Americans reached an all-time low (since the Bureau of Labor Statistics started keeping track in 1972) at 5.9 percent in May 2018 . But as many have pointed out, the decline in the Black unemployment rate began during President Obama's presidency.\n\nEven as the overall unemployment rate dropped after a sharp rise in March, the Black unemployment rate remained higher. White Americans have found work more quickly overall, and the employment gap has persisted , even as further economic relief from the government remains nowhere in sight. The continued failure to contain the coronavirus epidemic makes a full recovery even more difficult .\n\nTrump also chooses not to mention the kinds of jobs that Black Americans occupy. A Brookings Institution report found that Black Americans are overrepresented in low-wage, undervalued \"essential\" jobs in which they're more likely to die due to factors like the coronavirus.\n\nAccording to an Associated Press fact-check , household median income was higher for Black people before Trump took office. Furthermore, Trump's focus on the unemployment rate ignores other economic hardships that Black people face, like low rates of Black homeownership and low Black male labor force participation rates, according to the New York Times .\n\nIn the same breath, Trump has often celebrated the \"opportunity zones\" provisions included in the 2017 tax bill that he signed into law. While opportunity zones are supposed to encourage investment in high-need communities, according to a 2019 New York Times report , the program has mostly just benefited wealthy Americans making the investments, and haven't been proven to help underresourced communities. The early beneficiaries of the tax breaks are billionaires and Trump family members for \"high-end apartment buildings and hotels, storage facilities that employ only a handful of workers, and student housing in bustling college towns,\" according to the report.\n\nRelatedly, Trump cites declining poverty rates before the pandemic as proof of his success. \"Last year, Black and Hispanic American poverty reached the lowest ever in the history of our country,\" Trump said at the White House event earlier this month.\n\nAccording to census data , Trump's claim is correct but ignores the major disparities that remain. According to the data, the US poverty rate was 10.5 percent in 2019, the lowest since 1959, when data was first collected and released on this scale, with an 18.8 percent poverty rate for Black people and a 15.7 percent poverty rate for Hispanics.\n\nDespite these historic lows, Black and Hispanic people are overrepresented in the poverty population relative to their representation in the overall population. According to the data, Black people represented 13.2 percent of the total population in the United States but 23.8 percent of the poverty group - almost two times greater than their portion of the general population. Hispanics comprised 18.7 percent of the total population but 28.1 percent of the population in poverty - 1.5 times more than their share of the population.\n\nExperts are torn about whether Trump should be credited with the declines in poverty - which may be reversed without further economic stimulus . Trump has taken credit for the number of people who have stopped receiving food stamps under his presidency - in February, he claimed that 7 million people stopped receiving assistance through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.\n\nExperts say the decline in food stamp enrollment is due to \"improving employment opportunities and pay increases,\" with enrollment decreases beginning in 2014 and 2015 under Obama, according to the New York Times . But there could also be another reason for the decline in SNAP assistance: Trump has tightened eligibility requirements. In March, it was estimated that 700,000 people would be kicked off food stamps because of the administration's new strict work requirement . A federal judge recently struck down that requirement , calling it \"arbitrary and capricious.\"\n\nTrump has also repeatedly mentioned how his administration has funded historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs). \"They couldn't get funded. Nobody was funding them for years and years and decades, nobody was funding them,\" Trump said.\n\nThis is simply untrue: Under Obama, the federal government invested more than $4 billion in HBCUs over seven years.\n\nAnd while federal funding for HBCUs has been renewed under Trump's presidency , Trump has not publicly acknowledged that the renewal is the result of congressional appropriations.\n\n\"Congress does all this work and presents it to him in the budget, and he can choose to sign it. This year, he held off on signing some significant STEM funding, making HBCUs beg for it,\" Rutgers professor and leading HBCU authority Marybeth Gasman told the Washington Post . \"Trump has promised all kinds of things to HBCUs and has followed through on little. Under Trump, the White House Initiative for HBCUs was moved to the White House and is quite quiet compared to the work under President Obama's administration.\"\n\nIn 2016, Trump won just 8 percent of Black voters. The same holds true in 2020 - his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, leads Trump with Black voters, 83 percent to 8 percent, a 75-point margin, according to CNN . However, Trump's support among Black voters ages 18 to 44 has jumped from 10 percent in 2016 to 21 percent this year, according to FiveThirtyEight , \"while older Black voters look as if they'll vote for Biden by margins similar to Clinton's in 2016 .\"\n\n\"Black voters remain an overwhelmingly Democratic-leaning constituency , but a notable reduction in their support could still be a problem for Biden,\" according to the publication.\n\nIn a last-ditch effort to attract more Black voters, Trump unveiled his \" Platinum Plan \" for Black Americans mere weeks before the election. It includes proposals to designate the Ku Klux Klan and antifa as terrorist organizations, make lynching a hate crime, recognize Juneteenth as a federal holiday, and increase investments in Black communities by supporting Black homeownership, small businesses, and job creation. The plan is vague - it lists what Trump would seek to accomplish but doesn't explain how he'd get there. (For comparison, Biden's Lift Every Voice Plan, though far from perfect in the eyes of progressives , explains the steps a Biden-Harris administration would implement to support Black Americans.)\n\nBut if voters are still unclear about what Trump has done for Black Americans, no data is as stark as coronavirus data. From willfully misleading the public on the virus to dismantling the government's pandemic response team , Trump could have prevented tens of thousands of deaths early on. Instead, his inaction has left thousands of Black Americans dead, with the coronavirus killing them at twice the rate of white people.\n\nSince contracting the coronavirus, Trump has further downplayed the severity of the disease, tweeting , \"Don't be afraid of Covid. Don't let it dominate your life,\" dismissing the hundreds of thousands of Americans who have lost loved ones to the disease, many whose family members could not receive the kind of care and treatment the president did.\n\nWhatever economic gains Black Americans experienced in the early years of his term have also been undone in the pandemic, especially since more than 90 percent of Black businesses that applied for loans through the federal Paycheck Protection Program were denied. Forty percent of Black-owned small businesses have since closed, according to a Brookings Institution report .\n\nUltimately, the idea of \"who's done more for Black people\" homogenizes Black communities - stripping them of their diverse identities and backgrounds - and makes elected officials accountable during election season only.\n\nIn 2016, Trump made his pitch to Black Americans, asking, \"What the hell do you have to lose?\" With the way the past four years have played out, it's clear they had a lot to lose - and stand to lose a lot more.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nAn exhausting - if not exhaustive - timeline of J.K.

But there's a dark side.\n\nAnd how religion became a force in US politics.\n\nIn the past four decades, the gap between rich and poor has grown significantly. It's a dangerous trend.\n\nThese government scientists are likely the next in line for big cuts.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC. All Rights Reserved"

We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nResearch suggests black people want a systemic overhaul on crime reduction and inequality.\n\nby Aaron Ross Coleman\n\nIn the debate over the \"defund the police\" movement, both Democrats and Republicans have pointed to attitudes in black communities about policing to support their opposition to the idea.\n\nHowever, when it comes to policing and crime, black attitudes elude simple explanations. In polling, black people often express disgust at police racism yet support more funding for police. A 2015 Gallup poll found that black adults who believed police treated black people unfairly were also more likely to desire a larger police presence in their local area than those who thought police treated black people fairly. A 2019 Vox poll found that despite being the racial group with the most unfavorable view of the police, most black people still supported hiring more police officers. And more recently, a June 2020 Yahoo News/YouGov survey taken after the killing of George Floyd found that 50 percent of black respondents still said that \"we need more cops on the street,\" even as 49 percent of black respondents said when they personally see a police officer it makes them feel \"less secure.\"\n\nBlack people are not a monolith. Their opinions vary by age, gender, and class. These complex, seemingly contradictory feelings reflect the dilemma of being black in America. America's political class often demands that black people decide between abysmal options - between unemployment and minimum wage, between displacement and gentrification, between peer violence and police violence.\n\nOn law enforcement, the choice black Americans have historically faced is either suffering from the shootings, beatings, and stabbings of racist cops, or suffering from violent crime in redlined neighborhoods - again, abysmal options.\n\nWhen researchers actually take the time to listen to black people, however, they find black people don't want to choose between two bad options.\n\n\"Don't get me wrong,\" writes police abolitionist Mariame Kaba in the New York Times. \"We are not abandoning our communities to violence. We don't want to just close police departments. We want to make them obsolete.\"\n\n\"We should redirect the billions that now go to police departments toward providing health care, housing, education and good jobs,\" Kaba continues. \"If we did this, there would be less need for the police in the first place.\"\n\nIn the Yahoo News/YouGov poll, most black Americans said they were more worried about police brutality against minorities than about local crime and thought the Minneapolis City Council's pledge to dismantle their police was a \"good idea.\" They also favored \"gradually redirecting police funding toward increasing the number of social workers, drug counselors and mental health experts responsible for responding to non-violent emergencies.\"\n\nWhat this is really about is prioritizing communal safety, valuing human flourishing, and desiring policy solutions not predicated on state-sanctioned anti-black violence - consider this the third way.\n\nThe false binary of more or less policing, popular among both Democrats and Republicans, artificially narrows the possibilities for public policy.\n\nAs political factions seize on favored polling positions, creating a simplistic - or even misrepresentative - view of black Americans' beliefs, there's an even more fundamental problem: Surveys fail to measure attitudes toward complex policy solutions because they don't poll for them.\n\nSurveys fail to wrestle with \"the myriad ways in which American racism narrowed the options available to black citizens and elected officials in their fight against crime,\" as Pulitzer Prize-winning author and civil rights attorney James Forman Jr. described it. Or, as Yale Law School professor Emily Bazelon recently suggested in the New York Times, surveys show black people supporting police hiring \"partly because they don't see the government providing other resources for making their neighborhoods safe.\"\n\nToday, however, as the Black Lives Matter movement rises in popular opinion, and policymakers reckon with racism, this more-or-less policing dichotomy starts to fall apart.\n\nA close review of innovative research from Johns Hopkins and Yale University's Portals Policing Project and Black Futures Lab's Black Census Project broadly indicates that black people desire more community investment alternatives, more police transparency and accountability, and an end to police racism and brutality. In other words, they want a systemic, nuanced, and meliorating approach - not an either/or.\n\nIf you squint hard enough, it's possible to view black posture on policing as mildly frustrated but generally supportive. Indeed, review polls of black citizens, orders from black mayors, bills of black legislators, or the platform of black voters' preferred presidential candidate and you will repeatedly find approval for the police, and requests for more policing.\n\nThis isn't new. In 2015, even after the uprisings against police brutality in Ferguson, Missouri, and Baltimore, a Gallup poll found black citizens were 20 percent more likely than white Americans to say that they wanted more police officers, and they were 23 percent less likely than white Americans to say that they had enough police officers currently.\n\nLikewise, a 2018-2019 poll conducted by Vox and Civis Analytics found that most black people wanted more police in their neighborhood. As Ezra Klein summarized :\n\nWhat that polling found was, it's true, for instance, African Americans have a less favorable view of local police, but it's still very favorable. So white people have a 79% favorable view of the local police, Hispanic 77%, and black people 58%. And even given that the numbers are very close in terms of when you pull the different groups on whether or not they want to see more police officers hired into their communities. So among white people, 65% say they support that and 13% oppose it; among Hispanic folks, 64% supported and 13% oppose it. And among black people, 60% supported and 18% opposed it. So it is a little bit less popular in black communities, but not that much.\n\nThis positive stance toward policing is borne out in the preferences of black elected officials like Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser, who has become symbolic of black mayors who push back against calls to defund the police. Last week, Bowser said she was \"not at all\" reconsidering police funding amid activists' calls to shift budget priorities. Likewise, Rep. James Clyburn , the highest-ranking black member in Congress and a civil rights activist, said on CNN's State of the Union Sunday that \"nobody is going to defund the police.\"\n\nSimilarly, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, who has the overwhelming support of black voters, opposes defunding the police and instead suggested reforms like training officers to shoot somebody in the leg as opposed to in the heart .\n\nThis backing of pro-policing policy among black lawmakers and their allies is decades old. They overwhelmingly supported President Bill Clinton's 1994 crime bill, which put 100,000 more police on American streets with more punitive policing methods. As Princeton professor Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor explains in From #BlackLivesMatter to Black Liberation , \"Black mayors, including the mayors of Detroit, Atlanta, and Cleveland, pressured the CBC to vote for the legislation. They wrote to the chair of the caucus, Kweisi Mfume, urging him to support the legislation.\"\n\nTaylor writes that \"In the end, the majority of the CBC voted for the bill, including liberal luminaries like John Conyers and former Black Panther Bobby Rush.\"\n\nIt's possible to interpret black people's views of police as generally favorable. However, that interpretation would be based on the assumption that mainstream indicators of political attitude adequately and accurately capture the full complexity of opinions of black people - people who, despite Biden's musings, typically want to be shot in neither the heart nor the leg.\n\nThere are many potential shortcomings in relying on traditional forms of political opinion to interpret black attitudes. Black legislative officials are shown to disproportionately underrepresent the opinions of heavily policed, high-segregation areas.\n\nPolitical scientists like Emory's Andra Gillespie have argued that the electoral constraints of black politicians for winning in cosmopolitan, multiracial districts often require neglecting \"the most socially marginal members of the black community.\" In her book The New Black Politician: Cory Booker, Newark, and Post-Racial America , which examines some of the tensions of \"middle-class black representation of poor black constituents,\" Gillespie contends that \"the same forces that discouraged black leaders from addressing controversial problems in black communities also created opportunities for deracialized political candidates to gain political currency.\"\n\nIn practice, this means ambitious black officials shy way from third-rail topics like racialized police brutality and the social ills of segregation.\n\nMoreover as, James Forman Jr. notes in Locking Up Our Own: Crime and Punishment in Black America , these middle-class and \"elite\" black Americans often do not bear the brunt of aggressive criminal justice policy. Lower-income black people do. Therefore, the class differences often create a disconnect between the policing experiences of lower-income black people and the policy preferences of the middle-class black officials who represent them.\n\nTaylor also drills in on this point, explaining how civil rights-era class divisions led to a breakdown in representation for low-income black people. \"As more blacks entered the middle class, political demands shifted. Black elected officials were more in tune with the needs of their middle-class constituencies, black and white, than they were with the needs of the black working class.\"\n\nThis is crucial because black people are overwhelmingly working class. The median household income for a black family hovers around $41,000.\n\nBoth Taylor and Forman note that black people, especially working-class ones, favor a less punitive and more comprehensive approach to crime reduction. This is what Forman describes as the \"all-of-the-above strategy\" that includes support for police, courts, and prisons but also fixes joblessness, poverty, and segregation - generally speaking, the root causes of crime. Despite requesting both, American public policy has acted on black support for \"tough on crime\" policies but not on the social welfare policies, though if they had their druthers, polling suggests black people would choose the latter.\n\nAccording to the Race, Crime, and Public Opinion poll cited in a 2014 Sentencing Project report , researchers found that \"white Americans are also more likely than African Americans to endorse the use of the criminal justice system over other social policy tools to reduce crime.\"\n\n\"When asked how best to reduce crime, 35% of whites said by investing in education and job training (versus 58% of blacks), 10% said by investing in police and prisons (versus 1% of blacks), and 45% said through both means (versus 35% of blacks),\" researchers found.\n\nSo while many popular mainstream black elected officials unequivocally support police budgets, these positions more and more can fall out of sync with the black constituents who interface with the most aggressive policing on a day-to-day basis.\n\nPolling does capture black people's discontent with police racism and impunity. According to a 2019 Pew survey , \"84% of black adults said that, in dealing with police, blacks are generally treated less fairly than whites; 63% of whites said the same.\" The survey also found that \"Black adults are about five times as likely as whites to say they've been unfairly stopped by police because of their race or ethnicity (44% vs. 9%).\"\n\nSimilarly, a 2016 Pew survey found that \"Black Americans are far less likely than whites to give high police marks for the way they do their jobs.\" In the poll, \"only about a third of black adults said that police in their community did an 'excellent' or 'good' job in using the right amount of force (33%, compared with 75% of whites), treating racial and ethnic groups equally (35% vs. 75%), and holding officers accountable for misconduct (31% vs. 70%).\"\n\nLast year, the Black Census Project polled more than 30,000 black people (likely the largest poll of black people since Reconstruction) and found similar results. \"The vast majority of Black Census respondents see the excessive use of force by police officers (83 percent) and police officers killing Black people (87 percent) as problems in the community,\" the study read.\n\n\"Black Americans are far less likely than whites to give high police marks for the way they do their jobs\"\n\nThe polling also found \"nearly three-quarters of respondents (73 percent) agree that holding police officers responsible for the misconduct would improve police-community relations, while 60 percent favor requiring police officers to wear body cameras.\"\n\nHowever, while polls communicate black people's frustration with policing, their methodology and conventions limit their ability to assess black attitudes. As noted by the Black Census pollsters, their staff had to reformulate the way they conducted their survey to accommodate for mistakes regularly made in polling of black people. This included finding ways to distribute polls to people who did not have internet access, were incarcerated, or otherwise were marginalized.\n\nThese hurdles and others are why ethnographies and other long-term interviewing techniques are crucial to understanding marginalized black people, who are not regularly the focus of policymaking, and their opinions on policing.\n\nPolitical surveys can often be shallow. They represent a single snapshot in time. Often they fail to reach the right people altogether. As written in the Black Census Project , traditional probabilistic survey samples misstate black attitudes \"as traditional methods can exclude important information about communities that are under-represented.\"\n\nMore to the point, Johns Hopkins's political scientist and sociologist Vesla Mae Weaver argues , \"current research on policed population is totally inadequate to help us understand how the residents of neighborhoods like Michael Brown's are that are characterized by saturation policing, come to understand how police authority is experienced, and how policing is shaping the political thought and action of communities where it's concentrated.\"\n\nWeaver set out to address the survey's shortcomings in her Policing Portals Project . Working with a team of faculty, PhD candidates, and students from Johns Hopkins and Yale University, researchers \"amassed over 850 conversations across 14 neighborhoods in six cities - the most extensive collection of first-hand accounts of policing to date.\" The conversations took place at the researchers' \"portals\" - trailers that had been converted into art installations where community members could livestream a conversation with a resident living in another highly police-community. Over three years, 2,000 Americans discussed their experiences with the police in places like Ferguson, Baltimore, and central Brooklyn. The findings are striking.\n\nBlack citizens repeatedly expressed concerns about the political legitimacy of their local police. In the research published based on these conversations, the authors wrote that often, \"participants characterize police as contradictory - everywhere when surveilling people's everyday activity and nowhere if called upon to respond to serious harm.\" Locals also \"report that their experience of government bears little resemblance to official governance or written law.\"\n\nAnalyzing discussions between black participants, Weaver, along with Boston University's Spencer Piston and Yale's Gwen Prowse, emphasizes that \"the dialogues we trace here should be seen within their broader historical context, part of the decades-long 'stunning challenge to the legitimacy of state power in Black communities'.\"\n\nThese concerns about the political legitimacy of police are difficult to capture in analyzing in polling or black politicians' statements alone. This same sentiment was articulated by Ta-Nehisi Coates on a recent episode of The Ezra Klein Show .\n\n\"I think, among a large swath to a majority of black people in this country, the police are illegitimate. They're not seen as a force that necessarily causes violent crime to decline,\" Coates said. \"Oftentimes, you see black people resorting to the police because they have no other option, but they're not seen with the level of trust that maybe Americans in other communities bestow upon the police. They know you could be a victim to lethal force because you used a $20 bill that may or may not have been counterfeit, because you were asleep at night in your home and somebody got a warrant to kick down your door without knocking.\"\n\nWeaver's research traces the origins of police abuse and legitimacy to early adolescence, noting that many black interview participants \"reported being very early in their adolescents when they had their first encounter with police authority. The emotional force of minority youths' first experience of the police baptizes them in a way supplying a visceral and lasting memory of the state exerting power over their bodies.\"\n\nThis christening of black youth is similarly noted in the research of California State University sociologist Jan Haldipur, author of No Place on the Corner: The Costs of Aggressive Policing . He says that based on a multi-year study of stop-and-frisk in the South Bronx, \"sustained negative police interaction can fundamentally reshape someone's worldview.\"\n\n\"For young people, and I think this is a point worth emphasizing, negative police encounters can be extremely traumatic experiences, even when excessive force is not used,\" Haldipur said in an interview. \"They can be a source of stress. They are a source of anxiety. It can feel overwhelming. It can change the way you look at the state and these institutions that are supposed to protect you.\"\n\n\"It's sort of this idea of, do they really have my best interests in mind, and at a young age, it forces people to critically evaluate these systems,\" he told me.\n\nIn his book, Haldipur writes that this aggressive policing erodes \"faith in both local and state institutions.\"\n\nThis finding that black people view poor policing as an aspect of a broader state failure to provide adequate public goods and services comports with the research done by Forman and others that suggests black people regularly demand a more comprehensive policy solution. The Sentencing Project polling finding black people preferring investment to more policing bolsters this.\n\nAs Vanita Gupta, former head of the US Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division, said of her interviews during their investigations in Baltimore following the uprising:\n\nWhen I went to Baltimore to investigate policing for the Justice Department, after Freddie Gray died from injuries he got in police custody, in every community meeting that I went to, folks were not just talking to me about concerns about police abuse. They wanted the Justice Department to fix the schools, to fix public transportation so they could get to their jobs more easily. Policing problems - police violence, over-policing - were often the tip of the spear.\n\nIn terms of crime reduction policy, black people often support comprehensive reforms, emphasizing the need for development, education, and more democratic control. The complexities of the lived experiences of black people, particularly those living in violent neighborhoods, might not lend themselves to simple slogans, but in broad strokes, research on black opinions paints a radically different picture from the ones Americans currently inhabit. Such a world is one in which black people have full employment, quality schools, reliable public transit, health care, and local democratic control of safety and emergency services.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nAn exhausting - if not exhaustive - timeline of J.K.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nHow white supremacy tried to divide Black and Asian Americans - and how communities worked to find common ground.\n\nby Jerusalem Demsas and Rachel Ramirez\n\nAgainst the backdrop of anti-racism protests last summer, racist violence was surging in Chinatowns and Asian American communities across the country.\n\nIn July, an 89-year-old Chinese woman was set on fire while walking on the street after being slapped in the face in Brooklyn, New York. The two assailants, she said, didn't say a word before attacking her. She scrambled to put out the fire, but it left a large burn mark on the back of her pink blouse - a grisly reminder of the attack.\n\nIt was not an isolated incident. Between March 19 and December 31, 2020, there were more than 2,808 \"firsthand accounts of anti-Asian hate,\" according to a report by Stop AAPI Hate , an organization that has been tracking reports on anti-Asian violence - a 150 percent rise since 2019 . From being barred from establishments to being spat or coughed on, Asian Americans have reported physical and verbal harassment throughout the pandemic, as they've been used as a xenophobic scapegoat for the spread of a virus that originated in China. According to one survey conducted last April, 32 percent of Americans have \"witnessed someone blaming Asian people\" for Covid-19, and 60 percent of Asian Americans have witnessed this behavior.\n\nThis year, the attacks have seemed to take a more gruesome and visible turn: A 61-year-old Filipino man was slashed in the face as he rode the subway in New York; a 64-year-old Vietnamese woman was robbed in a parking lot in San Jose ahead of Lunar New Year; and an 84-year-old Thai man was shoved to the ground in San Francisco, which resulted in his death .\n\nThese attacks may have been spurred by the coronavirus pandemic and then-President Donald Trump repeatedly using racist terms for the virus , but anti-Asian sentiment in the United States is not new - just look to the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which banned Chinese immigrants from becoming US citizens, and President Franklin Roosevelt's executive order in 1942 that put Japanese Americans into internment camps.\n\n\"When the pandemic emerged and the president began calling the virus 'kung flu' or 'China virus,' those who were aware of how race operates knew that we were about to experience a surge of racism that we haven't seen in a while,\" said Pastor Raymond Chang, founder and president of the Asian American Christian Collaborative , a faith-based group advocating for Asian American communities while also leading Black and Asian solidarity. \"Racism against Asian Americans has always been a part of the fabric of our society. It just depends on whether it's overt and violent, or subtle and kind of flies under the radar.\"\n\nHow do you define your Asian identity? We want to hear from you for an upcoming story. Fill out this Google form to share your experience .\n\nWhat also isn't new in times of anti-Asian sentiment is the focus on relationships between Black and Asian communities. Many of the attacks that have gained widespread attention have featured Black assailants, and have threatened to inflame tensions between Asian Americans and Black Americans. While Vox found no evidence that Black Americans are predominantly responsible for this rise in attacks, or that they are particularly hostile to Asian Americans relative to the rest of the population, the narrative of Black-Asian hostility is rooted in immigration and economic policies that have historically pitted these communities against one another.\n\nIn America, \"what we need to realize is that there's this timeless structure, in which there's always one group on top and another at the bottom,\" Scott Kurashige, professor and chair of comparative race and ethnic studies at Texas Christian University, told Vox. \"Though there certainly is an unchanged structure in the sense that this country has had a white supremacist ruling class structure since the beginning, it's not the same techniques of governance or the same ideology, and certainly not the same people.\"\n\nUltimately, there is a failure to remember what got America to this place of racial hierarchies and lingering Black-Asian tensions: white supremacy. White supremacy is what created segregation, policing, and scarcity of resources in low-income neighborhoods, as well as the creation of the \"model minority\" myth - all of which has driven a wedge between Black and Asian communities. In fact, it is white Christian nationalism, more than any other ideology, that has shaped xenophobic and racist views around Covid-19, according to a recent study . And for Black and Asian American communities to move forward, it is important to remember the root cause and fight together against it.\n\nThere is already a long history of Black-Asian solidarity against oppression and structural racism, which has been obscured by these recent fissures. In the late 1960s, for instance, Black and Asian activists led the Third World Liberation Front movement to establish race and ethnic studies in college and university curriculums in California. And today, members of both communities are showing up for each other in demonstrations for Black lives and against anti-Asian violence.\n\n\"This is a moment for us to really tell that history to share that not only have Asians and other immigrants and people of color been blamed and scapegoated, but that there's also a history of our community, mobilizing, and demanding change and action - that we've stood in solidarity together with other communities,\" said Cynthia Choi, co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate.\n\nThe models we have for understanding and interpreting racism are often oversimplified and lead to frustration and resentment.\n\nA simple model of racism that casts people as either perpetrators or victims of racism is divorced from the reality that individuals have dozens of identities outside of just their race. The fact is that Black Americans are native-born Americans, and, like all native-born people, they are susceptible to xenophobic and nationalistic sentiments that can place blame on an \"other\" - in this case, Asian Americans, who can be seen as \"forever foreigners\" even if they, too, are native-born.\n\nWhile Black Americans (who are overwhelmingly Democratic) often have more liberal views on immigration reform, there is also existing research that indicates that Black people may feel economic competition with new immigrant communities that can manifest as broad anti-immigrant sentiment and racism.\n\n\"It's not that Asian-Black tensions or racial hierarchies don't exist today but that there is a failure to remember what got America to this place: white supremacy\"\n\nScholars also highlight that a lot of this competition is due to a racial hierarchy that has placed Black Americans at the bottom. When newcomers enter the country, they encounter a system that reserves the best for wealthy, white Americans, engendering resentment and zero-sum thinking among everyone else for whatever is left.\n\nThe conflict between Korean Americans and Black Americans is one of the most visible examples of this phenomenon.\n\nIn 1965, the United States ended the quota-based system of immigration and began to push for high-skilled labor to enter the country. One group that was able to enter the country were Korean Americans who were hyper-selected - that is, they had much higher socioeconomic and educational attainment relative not only to their country of origin but also to the native-born US population.\n\nYến Lê Espiritu, a professor of ethnic studies who specializes in Asian American studies at the University of California San Diego, explained how this highly educated population came to the United States and was often unable to replicate the social status that they enjoyed in their home country due to racial discrimination and other barriers. Instead, they found employment as small-business owners, opening up shops in predominantly Black communities.\n\n\"Many of these immigrants didn't intend to be small businessmen. The structural context is that Korean immigrants couldn't regain the employment and educational status they once held,\" Espiritu told Vox. Their proximity to Black people was because they were only able to start businesses in \"economically disadvantaged areas.\" This, coupled with the fact that anti-Black racism in financing meant Black people often couldn't start their own businesses, sparked bitterness on both sides.\n\nEspiritu added that an additional barrier was that both groups had already been primed to mistrust each other. As Koreans consumed American media, they internalized the racist depictions of Black Americans as violent, uneducated, and poor - similarly, Black Americans had watched (with the rest of America) as Koreans were depicted as untrustworthy during the Korean War.\n\nEdward T. Chang, a professor of ethnic studies at the University of California Riverside, explained the \"middleman minority\" theory, which helps further explain the tensions that arose at these Korean-owned businesses.\n\n\"'Middleman minority' is a term derived from the historical experiences of Jews in Europe and Chinese in Southeast Asia and Asian Indians in Africa,\" Chang told Vox. Middlemen minorities exist between dominant and subordinate groups in society and often hold professions heavily concentrated in the retail and service industries like grocery markets and liquor stores, he explained.\n\nThese groups often have daily contact with one another in a way that white Americans often do not due to segregated neighborhoods, shopping centers, and schools. Between the racist stereotypes both groups have internalized and the linguistic and cultural barriers separating them, it's little surprise the continual interactions could lead to conflict.\n\nIn America's collective memory, the most notable such collision occurred during the 1992 Los Angeles riots sparked by the acquittal of four white LAPD officers after they were videotaped beating Rodney King, a Black man. Over the following week, more than 50 people were killed and 1,000 were injured in the uprising that showcased not only anger at the verdict but also longstanding resentments between Black and Korean communities in the LA area. According to CNN , roughly half a billion dollars' worth of damage was borne by Korean-owned businesses.\n\nMany believe the 1992 riots are emblematic of the relations between Black Americans and Asian Americans despite being the product of a specific time and place. After the riots, churches and community organizers worked to educate the two communities on their shared histories of oppression - many Korean business owners, for example, were unaware of the violence and discrimination Black people have faced in America.\n\nToday, more than nine in 10 Korean Americans believe there is at least some discrimination against Black people, according to a survey by Asian Americans Advancing Justice. Meanwhile, 70 percent of Korean Americans agree that the government should do more to protect the civil rights of Black Americans.\n\nAccording to scholars and activists who have experienced it firsthand, Black-Asian tensions have obscured America's root problem: white supremacy.\n\n\"Racism and white supremacy have created longstanding rifts between communities of color,\" Pastor Chang said. \"The way the system works, the rhetoric around Black and Asian tensions will be used to discount the white supremacy that actually drives these tensions.\"\n\nTo be white is to sit atop America's ruling class - and since darker skin has historically been deemed undesirable and equated with being poor under Western and Eurocentric views, anyone who is not white falls at the bottom of this hierarchy. In this dominant Black-white paradigm, Asian immigrants and Asian Americans have had to find a way to fit in, rendering them at risk of invisibility. Those who could assimilate into the dominant framework often did, buying into the notions of racial hierarchies and white supremacy - including internalizing racism against their own communities.\n\nBut not all Asians are offered this opportunity: The categorization of Asian Americans encompasses roughly 40 ethnicities and a vast range of economic statuses, religions, regions, and cultures. While it's true that Asian Americans are the wealthiest minority group in the country, they also have the widest income gap of any racial group. Myanmarese Americans, for example, have a far higher poverty rate than other Asian groups, particularly Japanese Americans. A huge reason for this divide is due to the disparity between Asian immigrants who arrived in the US with skill-based visas and those who arrived as refugees.\n\n\"Our history is a story of seeking to belong but finding that our choices were often either erasure or exclusion or assimilation,\" Pastor Chang said. \"We ultimately chose to try to fight erasure in the form of assimilation to the degree that made us give up a lot of our cultural heritage. When it benefited the broader white society, they didn't punish Asians as much, but when Asians are perceived as a threat, they either incarcerated or excluded us altogether.\"\n\nThis rush to assimilation is what has perpetuated the model minority myth and helped further racial tensions. The model minority myth took root around the time Japanese Americans were put in internment camps in World War II. Asians were scared of returning or being put into camps, so they remained reticent and were seen as hard workers who, as Choi puts it, \"have been able to pull themselves up by the bootstraps or overcome barriers.\" This perpetuated the belief that nonwhite Americans can succeed and overcome racism in the US, without acknowledging the specific historical struggles of Black and Latino Americans and the role of skin color in creating a caste system meant to stoke interracial conflicts.\n\n\"The model minority stereotype really isn't meant to define Asian Americans. Rather, it's meant to define African Americans as deficient and inferior to white people by using Asian Americans as a proxy or a pawn to serve that purpose,\" Kurashige told Vox. \"It was never an accurate portrayal of Asian Americans, but actually consciously meant to distort and stereotype Asian Americans.\"\n\nThe recent rise in anti-Asian attacks has reflected the anti-Asian sentiment that has always coursed through America\n\nFor example, there are other ethnicities that meet the surface criteria of a so-called model minority but are unlikely to be seen that way. According to researchers at Columbia University and UC Irvine, nearly two-thirds of Nigerian immigrants are college-educated - far exceeding the US mean at 28 percent. Like Koreans, Nigerians were defined by hyper-selected migration, but unlike Koreans, they were racialized as Black in the US context. Nigerians are not held up as a \"model,\" yet more evidence that the minority myth was not about the outcomes of a specific group but a way to reemphasize the existing racial caste structure and absolve the government of removing barriers to success for Black people.\n\nThe model minority myth is to Asians what the \"Black criminality\" myth is to Black communities. Any image of Black people acting inherently violent toward Asian Americans or other groups of color feeds into the systemic tropes that have long painted Black people as criminals, which has been perpetuated by both American media and Asian media platforms like WeChat and Weibo . Last summer, Asian news media furthered the \"Black criminality\" image during the protests for racial justice, creating a fearmongering framework around incidents of looting and violence, rather than focusing on the largely peaceful protests.\n\nIn recent months, videos circulated in social media showing elderly Asians getting shoved and attacked, with a few of the attacks perpetrated by Black assailants, and the news and social media were quick to put the spotlight on historically complicated tensions between Black and Asian communities. Again, it's not that these fissures don't exist after decades of white supremacy-inflected policy - it's just that the emerging narrative has too easily attributed the violence to these tensions when there are other factors in play. For example, anti-Asian (and anti-China) sentiment is on the rise globally - from Australia to Europe to Canada , people are registering increasing hostility toward China and people who they think are Chinese. Not to mention in America, it is white Christian nationalists who are the most likely to say that it isn't racist to call Covid-19 \"the Chinese virus.\"\n\nUltimately, the recent rise in anti-Asian attacks has not only reflected the anti-Asian sentiment that has always coursed through America, but also underscores how Asian Americans' perceived model minority status has kept that racism out of the public consciousness for so long. So when America needs an answer to why this violence is happening - the same way it was quick to blame Asians for the pandemic - the tendency is to scapegoat Black people, or to claim that these incidents aren't racially motivated.\n\nAs author and activist Helen Zia said , Asian Americans are not \"missing in action\"; they are \" missing in history .\" And because of this invisibility, Asian Americans are often unaware of their own communities' history of activism and solidarity with Black communities and other communities of color.\n\nWhile the decades-long acculturation into a predominantly white society will take a lot of work to undo, the intergenerational gap between Asian immigrants who have absorbed anti-Black sentiment and younger US-born Asians who are much more willing to speak out against injustice will play a major role in this shifting narrative. And it starts with looking at the moments of solidarity that have come before.\n\nIn his book The Shifting Grounds of Race: Black and Japanese Americans In the Making of Multiethnic Los Angeles , Kurashige examines the coexistence of Black and Japanese Americans in Los Angeles, before, during, and after World War II, going back to the creation of the model minority myth.\n\nWhile Japanese Americans were incarcerated in camps, Black folks from the Jim Crow South migrated West to Los Angeles and settled in spaces that were previously occupied by Japanese Americans. After being released from internment camps, Japanese Americans found themselves having to integrate with their Black counterparts. Fearing being put back into camps, they tried to prove themselves worthy of earning back their constitutional rights by working hard. As policing and white fearmongering intensified in these communities, Japanese Americans were further invoked as a \"model minority\" for being able to rise up economically after their internment.\n\nBut that status didn't necessarily translate into divides between Japanese American and Black communities themselves. Kurashige cites stories of an African American elder who delivered care packages and letters to his Japanese friends when they were first put into temporary assembly centers before they were interned, and another story of a Black woman who sent high school yearbook copies to her Japanese American classmates who had been put in camps. When politicians and media stoked fears of \"race riots\" upon Japanese Americans being released from internment, one Black activist told the media, \"I have nothing against the return of the Japanese.\"\n\n\"A friend who was a waitress at this cherished, now demolished, bowling alley in Crenshaw in Los Angeles said she would serve udon noodles to African American customers who were having lunch with their Japanese American friends eating grits,\" Kurashige said. \"You can find solidarity moments like this all over the place when we shift the framework. We can still be concerned about racism and white supremacy, but we don't have to center whiteness and white ideologies all the time.\"\n\nMovements of solidarity between both communities are even more widespread and out in the open today. Like many Americans this summer, Asian Americans rallied around Black Lives Matter protests and vowed to interrogate anti-Blackness within their communities. \"I'm tired of the Asian community being quiet or missing in action when it's time to side with our Black brothers and sisters,\" one Asian American activist who joined the Black Lives Matter protests in Austin, Texas, told Vox last June . And now Black activists have joined the fight at recent rallies in New York and California, calling attention to the resurgence of anti-Asian violence. Heartwarming videos circulated on social media showing Black people chanting things like, \"We are on these streets fighting for Asian lives.\"\n\nHealing is happening at the community level, too. Last May, Pastor Chang led an effort to bring Black and Asian communities together by hosting a three-part panel series titled \" Interconnected ,\" in which they discussed racial biases and the deep-rooted history of Black and Asian American conflicts. And in the aftermath of the police killing of George Floyd, Ray brought together two churches a mile apart from each other - an African American church and an Asian American church - to lead a historic solidarity march for Black lives in Chicago.\n\n\"If you take a holistic look at our history, I truly believe that Asian Americans have more in common with the African American community than with the white community in America,\" Pastor Chang said. \"The fact that many people don't know that shows how historically malnourished we are and how fragmented our understanding of history is.\"\n\nIn addition to understanding this history, Alicia Garza, co-founder of Black Lives Matter and principal of Black Futures Lab, said it's important to continue fostering these interracial relationships. Without these interracial relations and solidarity movements, she said, white nationalist groups will end up benefiting if Black and Asian communities are seen at conflict with each other instead of addressing the overall problem of systemic racism and white supremacy head on.\n\n\"We need to make sure that we're not falling into the wedges and the traps that get set for us,\" Garza said. \"There is a long history of solidarity in Black communities and Asian communities - and those relationships are needed more than ever.\"\n\nIn this moment of racial reckoning, Garza, Pastor Chang, Choi, and others say it's imperative to have difficult and uncomfortable yet meaningful conversations across all racial groups to understand one another's collective struggles.\n\n\"We have to enter into the stories of other people and understand how their communities have been shaped and formed, and why they are the way they are,\" Pastor Chang said. \"That comes through learning, unlearning and relearning, because there's a lot of misconception and misunderstanding around how we actually got to where we are today.\"\n\nUltimately, the pandemic has exposed the cracks in America's society, bringing forth the layers of systemic racism and legacies of injustice that many Americans have chosen not to pay attention to until now. And it's not only up to Black and Asian American communities to do the work of building solidarity - it's the responsibility of all Americans to understand the role that white supremacy has played in creating these rifts that are exploited again and again.\n\n\"The crisis for me is not that there's this intractable clash of cultures between Black and Asian Americans,\" Kurashige said. \"The crisis is systemic: It is Covid-19, the persistence of white nationalism, police brutality, and these really anti-human discourses and practices that are at the center of so much of what's wrong in our country's history.\"\n\n\"We need dramatic change,\" he added. \"Radical solutions never come from the top down. They start off with groups at the grassroots level breaking through the status quo.\"\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nAn exhausting - if not exhaustive - timeline of J.K.

      "text": "Here's what the \"Black tax\" does to so many families - including mine\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nAs a money coach and a Black woman, I've seen the racial wealth disparity firsthand.\n\nby Lynnette Khalfani-Cox\n\nLast month, during my weekly FaceTime call with my mother, I noticed she was all bundled up in her home.\n\nSince the temperature had dropped in Georgia, where she lives, I didn't think much of it - even though Mom was wearing a thick winter sweater that seemed more appropriate for New York, where she was raised.\n\nOn the following week's video call, Mom was sporting a turtleneck. So this time, I asked her about it and she made a startling confession, sheepishly revealing that she didn't want to turn up the heat and have a larger utility bill, so she was basically toughing out being in a chilly house. When I urged her to warm things up, she assured me it was just a brief, temporary decision.\n\nBut the next Sunday, when I saw her dressed in a coat during our regular check-in, I knew it was more serious. \"Mommy, I will pay your utility bill,\" I told her. \"Turn up the heat to whatever temperature you'd like. But I don't want you sitting there in a cold house.\"\n\nFor me, forking over an extra $100 a month for a heating bill is no big deal. But 100 bucks is a lot of money for someone living mainly on a modest Social Security check. The episode served as a harsh reminder of how precarious my mom's financial situation is, especially at this stage of her life.\n\nVox's German Lopez is here to guide you through the Biden administration's burst of policymaking. Sign up to receive our newsletter each Friday .\n\nAt 77, my mom is single, retired, and has no retirement savings at all. Meanwhile, my family and I are doing great financially; thanks to entrepreneurship, investments in stocks and real estate, and some other smart money moves, we've amassed a seven-figure net worth.\n\nWe're extremely grateful for the privilege we have and count our blessings daily, especially since we know how rare it is for a Black family like us to be in this position. The median Black household has a net worth of only $24,100, a fraction of the $188,200 in net worth the median white household has, 2019 Federal Reserve data shows.\n\nAnd these numbers don't always show the nuance of financial instability for many Black families. A quarter of Black households have zero or negative net worth, compared with a tenth of white families, according to the Economic Policy Institute .\n\nThe reasons for the wealth gap are complicated and multi-layered, with racism, historical injustices, structural inequality, and educational disparities all playing a huge role. So do career choices, marriage status, and inheritance levels for Black people, which are starkly lower than for white people. The practice of redlining, for example, under which the government would not guarantee loans for Black Americans who were trying to purchase homes, as well as the effect of mass incarceration on Black representation in the workforce, are just a couple of examples of how African Americans are systematically prevented from building wealth.\n\nConsequently, here's the harsh reality about being Black in America: The deck is often so stacked against you that the weight of it all can feel overwhelming - no matter your income, your net worth, or how much you've achieved. For African Americans like me, systemic inequities and generations of poverty can make it seem like whatever you've done is never enough, especially when you know you'll have to help support relatives or make contingency plans for any number of scenarios out of your control.\n\nThe reality is that for those of us able to generate wealth and reach a level of comfort, we are often also financially supporting family members or paying down debt. We simply don't have that generational wealth that so many white families have to fall back on and start out their adult lives with. Even two people earning the same income can be looking at totally different financial situations based on their race and class: One could be putting money into savings or investing, while the other might be using that same income to pay a family member's rent or help support an aging parent's retirement.\n\nI know that people like my mother don't have any real safety net other than relatives. There's no inheritance coming. As a result, for far too many Black people, low income and low wealth translate into a lifetime of scraping by.\n\nMy mother married my father at age 19, and then my parents - neither of whom went to college - had five girls together in quick succession. When they met, my dad had been working as a shoeshine man in Harlem, just like his father and his grandfather. Several years after tying the knot, however, my father moved from New York to Los Angeles to take a shot at pursuing an acting career. When my mother later followed, with kids in tow, so did money problems and a host of other marriage woes.\n\nSome of my earliest childhood memories are of my parents arguing over finances, including my father's chosen work endeavors. Acting gigs weren't steady, and the shoeshine stands that my father set up in Southern California didn't produce a regular paycheck. With five mouths to feed, my mom didn't like him exploring his creative passions or his entrepreneurial side.\n\n\"Michael, you need to get a real job!\" she would yell at him. By the time I was 7, they divorced, leading to years of increased financial struggle, including periods when we lived with my mom in a shelter or simply squatted in empty apartments without paying rent.\n\nSince my father didn't pay required child support payments, my mom, Lucille, juggled multiple jobs, mostly as a secretary and a cashier. Along the way, she made an incredible number of sacrifices for her five daughters and always pushed us all to go to college and prioritize education. Ultimately, Mom retired as a school bus driver in a suburb of Atlanta.\n\nShe now gets a pension of just $182 a month, along with a Social Security check of roughly $1,500 monthly. That's what she lives on, along with occasional money she receives from my husband and me and from my oldest sister, Cheryl, who also lives in Georgia.\n\nLike so many struggling retirees in America, my mom can sometimes be too proud to ask for help. I know she doesn't want to feel like she's imposing on her kids. Then there are times that she won't request assistance because she feels guilty about her own spending.\n\nAmong Black Americans, it's not uncommon for those who can to help family members financially: Some call it the \"Black tax,\" a term commonly used in South Africa that refers to the obligations of first-in-the-family college graduates, professionals, or others who \"make it\" to assist their family members.\n\nI'm happy to help out my mother by covering her needs when she's short on cash. But it can be an emotional experience for her to even ask, especially when her spending choices sometimes exacerbate her financial challenges.\n\nI'm definitely not judging her, as I've battled the same demons. Twenty years ago, I had $100,000 just in credit card debt. Fortunately, I paid it all off by aggressively budgeting, reining in excess spending, and using every bit of \"extra\" money - like income tax refunds and work bonuses - to attack my debts. Even though I'm now financially comfortable, if I'm being honest, one of my biggest fears in life is that I might still wind up like my mother: elderly, alone, and nearly destitute.\n\nI guess I should probably share at this point that for the past 18 years, I've worked as a money coach and co-owner of a financial education business. So anyone who knows me and my current circumstances may think my fears are ridiculous, or that I'm being hyperbolic. For starters, I'm happily married to a great guy who happens to be my business partner, too. I'm a Gen X-er, and I'm far from broke.\n\nBut I also realize how fragile economic stability can be, both because of my own family and from what I know through my professional work. Even for many higher-income African Americans, financial security often feels so tenuous, in part because of family demands and in part because that's just the reality of being Black in America, where historical and current disparities loom so large.\n\nI'm not alone in experiencing the realities of living with the Black tax. Recently, on the social media app Clubhouse, an entire conversation was devoted to this topic. The room was packed, including with people like Ervin Johnson, a Black millennial who works as an executive at a nonprofit in Washington, DC.\n\n\"It was like a therapy session for Black professionals,\" Johnson later told me of the Clubhouse experience. \"There's so much to unpack about the Black tax,\" he added, \"because it's definitely a hidden burden that's in the back of your mind all the time.\"\n\nLike many Black people who are the first in their family to earn a high salary, Johnson contributes significantly to his parents' finances, including paying for various health care costs, insurance, and more. \"I'm glad that I'm in a position to help. But you do sometimes feel guilty about your success or about hitting certain goals,\" he said. \"It's also a responsibility that sometimes makes you wonder how much further along you could be financially.\"\n\nWith my mom's permission, I looked recently at her Social Security statement, which details her earnings record for the more than 40 years that she worked. The statement showed that for most of her life, my mother earned anywhere from $15,000 to roughly $25,000 annually. In her two highest-grossing years - 2000 and 2001 - she earned $31,685 and $33,739.\n\nThe part of me that's shocked at that wonders: How on earth did she raise five girls on such a small sum?\n\nBut another part of me - the kid who dealt with the lights being disconnected or who frequently stood on our apartment's heat grates to stay warm - knows how: my mother's grit, prayers, and determination that her girls would have a better life than she had.\n\nWe lived in two-bedroom apartments my entire life: my mom in one bedroom and my sisters and I, five girls - all of us born one and two years apart - in another small room with two sets of bunk beds. We survived with the help of welfare and various federal assistance programs like food stamps, Section 8 housing vouchers, and government powdered milk.\n\nI remember from ages 9 to 16, along with my Black and Latino peers who also grew up in various low-income neighborhoods throughout central Los Angeles, busing into wealthy white school districts. There, I'd hang out in upscale neighborhoods like Brentwood and the Pacific Palisades, where kids all had their own bedrooms, sprawling homes with pianos in the family room or pools in the backyard. It was an eye-opener, to say the least, and the first time I encountered a group of people for whom homeownership was the norm.\n\nIn America, homeownership typically represents about two-thirds of the average household's wealth. Unfortunately, the national rate of homeownership for Black people is abysmally low: just 44.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with 74.5 percent for white households, the US Census Bureau reports .\n\nPerhaps that's why I'm now so determined, especially after having children, to make generating wealth a part of my legacy. We believe so strongly in homeownership and education as pathways to building wealth that my husband and I have made a commitment to give our children the kind of financial assistance my mother wasn't able to provide for me, including paying for college, a car, and a down payment on a first home.\n\nWhile it's my duty to support my kids, I don't consider my mother to be my obligation in the exact same way. Nonetheless, having the ability to aid her financially has made me grateful for my financial strength and keenly aware of my fiscal goals.\n\nAs we continue our wealth-building endeavors - now and in the decades ahead, when I'm in my 60s, 70s, and beyond - I want my husband and me to have laid such a rock-solid economic foundation for ourselves and for our children that they won't ever need to assist us in any way. They will not have to face the prospect of having their economic or social mobility hampered by the generation that preceded them.\n\nThough it can sometimes seem next to impossible to truly get ahead as a Black person in America, I cling fast to my goals, drawing on Lucille's imperfect yet impressive example of overcoming insurmountable odds for my kids' sake.\n\nIn this way, I'm very happy to be exactly like my mother: Above all else, I just want the best for my children.\n\nLynnette Khalfani-Cox is a personal finance expert , speaker, and author of 15 books, including the New York Times bestseller Zero Debt .

We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nBetween the pandemic and protests, practitioners of African religions are welcoming the community and liberation their traditions can bring.\n\nby Nylah Iqbal Muhammad\n\nBetween the pandemic and protests, practitioners of African religions are welcoming the community and liberation their traditions can bring.\n\nby Nylah Iqbal Muhammad\n\nPorsche Little , a Brooklyn-based artist, diviner, and aborisha - or someone who serves the Orisha, a group of spirits central to the Yoruba and other African Diaspora religions - says that she has received a huge increase in requests for divinations and readings throughout the pandemic.\n\n\"There's so much happening right now in the world to everyone, and I know for certain that all of this is happening for a reason,\" she says. \"A lot of people are stuck in the house and can't really make sense of their lives, but that's what I'm here for.\"\n\nLittle says when she counsels people in her community these days, they specifically want to talk about challenges arising from this tumultuous time we're living in. Between a terrifying pandemic , a major racial reckoning , an existential crisis that climate change presents , and a government that fails to address any of these things, some Black people are turning to African and Black Diaspora traditions as a means of comfort, community, healing, and liberation.\n\n\"With the pandemic and the anxiety and the fear and all of those emotions that all of us are dealing with right now ... in the beginning my spiritual practice helped keep me connected and grounded. It helped me understand this moment in the larger context,\" says Akissi Britton, an assistant professor of Africana Studies at Rutgers University and Lucumí priestess for 36 years.\n\nThe Black Diaspora has been through centuries of struggle, resistance, and joy since being scattered from our original homelands. And through it all, many of us have connected with those original practices - food, family structures, languages - as a way of healing and building community with each other. The same goes for African and Black Diasporic spirituality, like the Yoruba, Lucumí, and Santería traditions; many practitioners of these religions offer a different type of healing, one that is removed from traditionally Westernized versions, which generally stress individualism and independence. African traditions, instead, are reliant upon collectivism, strong communities, and healthy interdependence.\n\nMost of these traditions revolve around Orisha (sometimes referred to as Orisa, or Òrìṣà in the Yoruba language, or Orixá in Latin America), a group of spirits from the Yoruba religion that provide guidance. Yoruba and other practitioners are often connected to one Orisha, usually called their guardian - like Oshun , the goddess of love, fertility, and success, and Babalú-Aye , Orisha of healing, including against airborne diseases that can cause epidemics. People who seek practitioners like Little are looking for guidance, which comes from rituals that invoke the Orisha , like baths or offerings and sometimes the reading of tarot cards. Sessions and ceremonies are often private and individualized.\n\nBritton says that growing up in the Afro-Cuban Lucumí religion, which is derived from the Yoruba tradition, gave her a fulfilling sense of self. \"I am not separated from my Orisa, from my ancestors, from the spirits, as well as from my community,\" she says. \"When my sense of self is much broader and attached to other things, I don't feel so isolated. I don't feel so alone, like I'm trying to figure it out on my own.\"\n\nBritton spiritually counsels others, but she encourages them to seek therapy if they can, too; Lucumí priestesses are not necessarily trained therapists, psychiatrists, and psychologists. Britton has sought out therapy for herself, and says that it works well with her spiritual practice. Often in therapy, she says, \"I have gotten information that my ancestors and Orisa have given to me, which is just confirmation.\"\n\nJo, a former student of Britton's and an Afro-Boricua artist and community organizer, says that the Lucumí religion offered her healing after a tumultuous relationship with both race and religion as a child. Growing up with a white mother and in the Christian church, Jo had little connection to her father's Puerto Rican family. Still, she was always drawn to the beauty of the complex cultural practices in the Boricua community.\n\nEarly in her life, Jo says, she didn't receive much affection from the people who were \"supposed to love\" her, and instead she experienced a lot of pain. She completely rejected Christianity and religion altogether, until she found strength and healing in Lucumí. Although she didn't come to Lucumí until adulthood, she feels much of it has always been with her.\n\n\"In some weird way, I always felt protected,\" she says. \"My angels and ancestors have always been the ones to bring me that feeling. As an adult, I was led right back to the same innate practices I believed in when I was young. I reconnected with the voices and knowings I had turned away from for so long. And it changed my life.\"\n\nFor practitioners of African spirituality, healing often comes in the form of liberation and resistance. These traditions are made even more pressing considering the centuries-long attempts by European slave owners, colonists, and neo-colonists to suppress and demonize these religions. And now, in a time when America's racist foundation has been pushed to the foreground, seeking solace in this connection feels especially poignant.\n\nDuring slavery, Christianity was used to justify the horrific practice. As such, the enslaved were often forbidden from practicing their indigenous religions, and other religions like Islam. Even in places like Cuba, Brazil, Haiti, and Trinidad, European colonists and slave masters attempted to obliterate the humanity and autonomy of enslaved Africans, Britton says. Many in the Black Diaspora embraced Christianity, finding a different sort of liberation in a religion meant to oppress them - a radical tradition that continues today, especially in the African American Episcopal Church (AME).\n\nHowever, as a form of resistance, other enslaved Africans syncretized their indigenous religions with Christianity, creating traditions like Santería, Vodun , and Hoodoo . For instance, the word Santería means \"honor to saints,\" and the religion is infused with the Spanish Catholicism that was indoctrinated into enslaved Africans early on. In fact, some practitioners correspond Orishas with Catholic saints - Eleguá, associated with roads and paths, corresponds with Saint Anthony, the patron saint of travelers and lost things - while others believed in removing the Catholic component altogether, as they saw the European influences as antithetical to goals of decolonization and autonomy.\n\nBut syncretizing practices wasn't a matter of happenstance. \"[Africans'] ingenuity, their creativity, their brilliance allowed them to maintain certain practices from home while masking them in the practices that Europeans insisted upon,\" Britton says. Santería was \"the masking behind the saints ... that in itself is a liberation practice,\" she says.\n\nBritton points out that the Haitian Revolution - the only successful slave revolt and an event that led to the creation of the first free Black republic - while not specifically Lucumí, was \"the coming together of Africans, different ethnic groups too, that had a ceremony that inspired and gave strength for the revolution that made it.\"\n\n\"Africans and their descendants [have] refused to allow Europeans slave masters and colonialists to dictate their full humanity,\" Britton says. \"This gave them a very strong sense of identity, inspiration, spiritual grounding that was liberatory in the sense that it allowed them to think differently and understand themselves differently than the dominant models do.\"\n\nLittle, who is studying Ifá and Lucumí traditions, says honoring Orisha and her ancestors helps her connect with her past before enslavement and colonization. She has been following the path to become an initiated priestess, which is mostly focused on immersing oneself in community as they guide you, something that can feel like coming home for so many Black people. \"I spent a lot of my life wondering who I was, and where I came from, but now I don't question that. It has truly reconnected me with not only my roots but with people that I've known from past lives,\" she says. \"There's a certain power that comes with remembering where you came from.\"\n\nBecause of the oppression people in the Black Diaspora faced, however, stigma against African spirituality exists today. The Roman Catholic Church has often viewed these practices as akin to demon worship. I know in my own family, some people see these practices as evil or dangerous. Others embrace it.\n\nLittle says that we should interrogate those ingrained beliefs and where they come from, particularly relating to Christianity and other religions closely related to \"conquest, murder, homophobia, sexism, and slavery amongst so many other forms of violence.\" For Little, it's worth questioning why some in the diaspora have been taught that African religion, which she says \"connects you with your personal power, identity and lineage,\" is evil. She suggests that \"people need to decolonize their own minds and then see what serves them best.\"\n\nRuqaiyyah Beatty, who grew up practicing Christianity, Islam, and other other African religions, is a now practitioner of Ifá , a Yoruba religion and system of divination. She says that through her practice, she was able to find healing through connection. \"I was able to connect to Nigeria, it gave me a global network of spirituality, divine guidance, family, and love, and I was able to create and sustain a great relationship to god,\" she says.\n\nFor those looking to get involved with African spiritual traditions, Britton stresses that research is key. She suggests reading books by independent scholar John Mason , who wrote Black Gods - Orisa Studies in the New World, which discusses 13 Orisha, including their symbols, personal characteristics, philosophical values, animal familiars, and feast days.\n\nShe also says it's important to enter these spaces from a place of respect, seeking mentorship and accountability, and above all, community. \"You cannot do this by yourself,\" she stresses. The best way to guard against misinformation, Britton says, is to go slow, research, and talk to people.\n\nWhile African spirituality can keep us connected during a time that can feel especially isolating, Little says, it can also keep us empowered. \"I just want people to know that although there is a higher power, remember that you have power as well. I want us all collectively to start using our intuitions ... and to question everything.\"\n\nNylah Burton is a Denver-based writer. She covers mental health, social justice, and identity.

      "text": "How the effort to resettle formerly enslaved Black Americans created Liberia\n\nThe trip began with William D. Coleman, a boy who had grown up on a plantation.\n\nThe landscape looks like many places in the United States. Yellow school buses wend their way through streets with familiar names like Johnson and McDonald. There is a Masonic temple, structures that resemble those in the American South and even a flag - complete with a star and stripes -- that resembles Old Glory.\n\nBut this is not America. It's Liberia, a small nation.\n\nBefore the American Civil War, many formerly enslaved people and their descendants lived in the U.S. Some white religious groups believed these individuals could never be truly free in a segregated society, prompting them to support a movement for expatriating free Black people. In 1816, the American Colonization Society, or ACS, was formed to pursue this goal.\n\n\"They aimed to form a colony in Africa and to have free Blacks who chose to go to leave and go to Liberia,\" C. Patrick Burrowes, Historian of Liberia, told ABC News. \"They were joined by people who were politicians and who thought that the repatriation of Blacks to Africa was important to preserve stability in the U.S. About as long as free Blacks were here, that would influence those who were enslaved, and those who were enslaved might rebel.\"\n\nThe ACS purchased land in Africa, naming it \"Liberia,\" which means \"the land of the free.\" Its capital, Monrovia, is named after U.S. President James Monroe.\n\nIt is estimated that approximately 15,000 freed Black Americans resettled in Liberia. They began building a country based on their knowledge, overcoming challenges from the local population.\n\nAmong those who would make the journey was William D. Coleman, a boy who had grown up on the Wardlaw Plantation in Fayette County, Kentucky.\n\nJames Wardlaw's will stipulated that upon his death, he wanted freedom and safe passage for William and his mother and uncle and all enslaved people on his property, provided they emigrated to Liberia.\n\nBurrowes states that records show that in 1853, William, his mother Ellen, and an uncle boarded a ship in Baltimore and set sail for Liberia.\n\n\"Life was rough because you're coming into a place that's new,\" Burrowes said. \"Certainly not as rough as it would have been on a plantation. And now you're working for yourself.\"\n\nABC News visited what has been dubbed \"Kentucky in Africa,\" where relics of the past still stand to this day. During the visit, we met the Colemans' direct descendants.\n\n\"From the time they came in, they started fashioning things after the U.S., the flag, everything,\" Martin Coleman said. \"The structures on Jefferson's plantation or Madison's plantation were not built by Jefferson himself. He might have designed them, but the actual enslaved people were the ones who built them. So they had those skills.\"\n\nIn 1847, at a Baptist church, Liberians signed their own Declaration of Independence. William D. Coleman, born enslaved on an American plantation, eventually became the nation's 13th president.\n\nThe Colemans' search for freedom would not end there.\n\nDecades later, during the brutal Liberian Civil War, a portion of the family chose to flee the violence by returning to America.\n\n\"I don't think anybody ever planned to come back, you know,\" James Coleman said. \"But when the coup took place, thank God we had a place of refuge. And we can come back to, you know, and settle again and try to start all over... But, yeah, I mean, America and Liberia always had a very close relationship; it's a full cycle.\"\n\nEvery year, the Colemans hold a big family reunion. What began in 1998 as a small core gathering of Colemans has now blossomed into a massive event, with as many as 300 American and Liberian Colemans attending, reaching across two continents and several U.S. states.\n\n\"We hope that they don't get mixed up and don't know who they are,\" 93-year-old Genevieve Coleman-Garnett said. \"We wanted them to know who they were and where they came from.\"\n\nThe descendants of William D. Coleman had an opportunity to reflect on their shared legacy and give back. They also created a foundation aimed at rebuilding the nation that granted them liberty.\n\n\"You know, life is better here, you know, than it is over there,\" James Coleman said. \"We got to continue to work, though. And remember, we know who we are, why we came where we came from, and do what we can to help the situation over there.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Additionally, an estimated 997,673 excess deaths occurred among Black males and 628,464 excess deaths occurred among Black females.\n\nAccording to the study, among a multitude of causes of death in this minority group, heart disease in both sexes and cancer rates in males were major contributing factors. These findings suggest that prior efforts made to eliminate disparities in death rates have not been successful.\n\nThe study also noted that infants and middle-aged adults had the largest excess years of potential lives lost. The years of potential life lost among Black males was 47 million, and 35 million in Black females.\n\nThere seemed to be substantial progress from 1999 to early 2010s, but \"despite initial progress during the early 2000s, [the study] found persistent excess mortality rates among non-Hispanic Black adults,\" César Caraballo , a postdoctoral associate at CORE and lead author of the study, said in prepared remarks.\n\nDespite progress narrowing health disparities in the early 2000s, progress later stalled - and was especially exacerbated by the pandemic, consistent with fears of the COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately affecting the Black population more than the non-Hispanic white population, according to the study. Early in the pandemic, the death rate abruptly increased and exceeded previous years. In 2020, the number of excess deaths among both Black men and Black women was higher than in previous years, the study showed.\n\n\"The abrupt worsening of these disparities in the first year of the pandemic indicates that current efforts to eliminate mortality disparities have been minimally effective and that progress has been fragile,\" Caraballo said.\n\nResearchers said both pandemic-specific factors (higher infection exposure, financial instability, food insecurity and financial distress) and social factors (structural racism, systemic bias, barriers to healthcare, higher prevalence of multiple chronic conditions and worse average health status) contributed to the vulnerability in the Black population.\n\nMedical experts say that analyzing the excess death rate should raise awareness of the unfair health burden of Black Americans and spur new policies specifically designed to ease this glaring disparity.\n\nIfesinachi Nnaji, MD, is a resident physician in family medicine at Stony Brook Southampton Hospital and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "'I felt powerless': Black Americans suffering from long COVID say they have trouble accessing care\n\nBlack patients often struggle to receive treatment, advocates say.\n\nThroughout the pandemic, Black Americans have made up a disproportionate share of cases , hospitalizations and deaths compared to any other racial or ethnic group.\n\nNow, doctors and advocates are warning the Black community is facing another barrier: access to long COVID care.\n\nLong COVID occurs when patients who were infected with the COVID-19 virus have lingering symptoms for more than four weeks after recovering. In some cases, these symptoms can persist for months or even years.\n\nIt's unclear what causes people to develop the condition, but research is ongoing .\n\nAccording to data from the U.S. Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey , with the latest update conducted between Jan. 4 and Jan. 16, 28.7% of Black respondents said they currently have or have had long COVID.\n\nBy comparison, 27.6% of white adults reporting having or having had long COVID. Hispanic adults were the only racial/ethnic group with a higher percentage reporting long COVID at 31.7%.\n\nHowever, when it came to adults currently with long COVID who are suffering from significant limitations, Black patients had the highest share of people reporting, the survey shows.\n\nData shows 34.6% of Black Americans with long COVID report severe limitations on their ability to perform day-to-day activities. Hispanics had the second highest rates of severe physical limitations at 32% and those who reported being multiple races or another race were 30.5%.\n\nOne of those people is Chimére Smith, a 40-year-old former middle school English teacher from Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nSmith said she contracted COVID in late March 2020. Her symptoms started off with a scratchy throat and soon progressed to a myriad of symptoms including extreme fatigue, a persistent cough, fogginess, headaches, nausea, diarrhea and spinal pain.\n\n\"I remember trying to do some type of social media dance with my partner and after like two minutes, I had to sit down because the world was spinning,\" she told ABC News. \"And so, within those first few days, as I said to my partner, 'I think I have COVID.'\"\n\nSmith said she went to two hospitals in the Baltimore area, both of which were familiar with her medical history, but doctors refused to test her for COVID-19.\n\n\"They told me that my symptoms were not profound enough to test,\" she said. \"They told me that they didn't have enough tests. They told me that I was fine and that I was just being anxious because we were out of school for the unforeseeable future. I got a lot of doctors telling me I was anxious, and that I was okay.\"\n\nHowever, Smith's symptoms continued for several weeks and even months, to the point where she lost vision in her left eye and was left unable to work or drive.\n\nSmith said she paid more than a dozen visits to doctors and hospitals asking for help, but she said she was discharged after every visit with no treatment plan in place.\n\nSmith said she had never been dismissed by a doctor before and felt discouraged.\n\n\"I felt extremely frustrated,\" she said. \"I was incredibly sad and depressed about that. I felt very despondent. I had several white male doctors sit at my bedside and ask me, 'Are you sure there's nothing personal going on in your life? Are you sure? Is it a relationship issue? Was it a job issue?'\"\n\nShe continued, \"But nobody wanted to listen to me. And so, it was infuriating. I felt powerless. The way that some of those doctors talk to me, I can tell they were talking to me that way because I was a Black female patient, who they assumed did not know anything about what was happening to her body.\"\n\nIn April 2021, Smith testified before the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health on the lingering effects of COVID-19.\n\nThere is a history of distrust when it comes to the Black community and the health care system due to beliefs among patients that doctors won't treat them as well as their white counterparts. A 2012 meta-analysis found Black patients were 22% less likely than white patients to receive any pain medication.\n\nThere is also a fear of being used as guinea pigs in clinical research or other studies as what occurred during the Tuskegee experiments from 1932 to 1971.\n\nBlack men were injected with syphilis to track progression of the sexually transmitted in infection, but the study was conducted without informed consent and patients never received treatment for the disease.\n\nWhat's more, eugenics movements in the 20th century saw many women across communities or of color forcibly sterilized.\n\nDr. Panagis Galiatsatos, an assistant professor and physician in pulmonary and critical care medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, told ABC News there is unconscious and implicit bias in the medical field that may lead to doctors dismissing Black patients compared to white patients.\n\n\"I can tell you, for a lot of affluent patients coming to our clinic or white patients, what got them to this clinic is that their doctor took their symptoms seriously and got him to our clinic,\" Galiatsatos, a member of the Johns Hopkins Post-Acute COVID-19 Team, said. \"Counter that with disadvantaged patients from a socioeconomic standpoint or Black/African-American patients, it took them several doctors to listen to what they're experiencing before someone took them seriously.\"\n\nDuring the period when she thought no one was listening to her, Smith said she felt like she was going to die before anyone figured out what was wrong.\n\nIt wasn't until a year and two months after Smith's symptoms first began that she visited a doctor who told her she believed that Smith was suffering from long COVID.\n\n\"I had a doctor's appointment on May 20, which was my 39th birthday, and on that day was when a physician, a Black woman said to me, for the very first time, 'I believe you,'\" she said. \"And when she said that I cried like a baby. Because I could not believe somebody was actually telling me, 'I believe you. Everything that you're saying to me, convinces me that you had COVID.'\"\n\nIt's not just a matter of getting doctors to believe Black patients. There's also trouble accessing care among the Black community.\n\n\"So, with my own eyes, my colleagues and I have seen it in our own clinic, where those that are so economically disadvantaged, those of minority race, their persistence of symptoms by the time they get to our clinic have been going on for a little over a year,\" Galiatsatos said. \"When we counter that versus populations of higher socioeconomic status or the white race, for instance, those individuals usually catch us well within three to six months.\"\n\nThere are several factors at play. Black Americans traditionally have less access to insurance -- let alone quality insurance -- allowing them to see a doctor at a post-COVID clinic.\n\n\"So many of our patients that we've taken on have had to go through several insurance authorizations just to get a referral to come to us, and that's what they will say is part of their delay,\" Galiatsatos said.\n\nAdditionally, despite several clinics opening up across the country, Black patients are more likely to rely on public transportation, meaning less access to clinics. Galiatsatos said fewer than 10% of the patients he sees at the post-COVID clinic are Black.\n\nBlack households are also less likely to have internet. According to the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies , 34% of Black adults in the U.S. do not have home broadband, meaning they may not have information about long COVID or know where to go to receive care.\n\nWhat's more, a 2022 study found Black Americans make up about 15% of the U.S. workforce, but are much more likely than white Americans to hold frontline or essential jobs, accounting for 30% of bus drivers and 20% of food service workers, for example.\n\n\"A day missed of work is a day missed of income,\" Galiatsatos said. \"If those patients have long COVID, they're going to decide between a paycheck and their health every day and that's not fair to them.\"\n\nTo close the racial gap in long COVID care, Galiatsatos recommends more regular implicit bias training among doctors and more telemedicine so patients can access specialized clinics.\n\nSmith, the long COVID patient, said school buildings, historically black colleges and universities, churches and other community organizations can be used to educate Black communities on the effects of COVID and long COVID.\n\nWhile Smith is able to cook and drive again, she still is unable to work and experiences several symptoms including brain fog, short-term memory loss, joint pain, gastrointestinal inflammation and headaches.\n\nShe hopes her story will help educate others and convince them to be their own advocate if they get pushback from physicians.\n\n\"This has been my reality for three years,\" she said. \"I would rather be in a classroom with 40 kids, talking about how to write a great essay, than sitting here talking to you. Three years later, and I still get no comfort. I love telling my story to inspire other Black people and Black families, but I don't get any joy.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "US economy 'has never worked fairly for Black Americans,' Treasury chief says\n\nFed data shows white families have 8 times the average wealth of Black families.\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen discussed the systemic inequities still lurking in the U.S. economy and the work her department \"needs to do to narrow the racial wealth divide,\" during remarks Monday at an event honoring the late Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\n\"From Reconstruction, to Jim Crow, to the present day, our economy has never worked fairly for Black Americans -- or, really, for any American of color,\" the Treasury chief said during the Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action Network's annual breakfast honoring the life and legacy of King.\n\nOn what would have been his 93rd birthday, Yellen reflected on how the late civil rights icon -- often referred to as the \"moral leader of our nation\" -- knew that, \"economic injustice was bound up in the larger injustice he fought against.\"\n\nSince taking office last January, Yellen said that she and her team have worked hard to \"ensure that neither the figurative bank of justice -- nor any literal economic institution -- fails to work for people of color.\"\n\nShe said the Treasury has recently completed its first equity review, \"looking across the department and asking: Where are our operations not as inclusive as they should be?\"\n\nYellen added that they have also hired the department's first-ever counselor on racial equity and sought to hire the \"most diverse leadership team in Treasury's history.\" She added that the Treasury was injecting some $9 billion into Community Development Financial Institutions and Minority Depository Institutions that seek to serve people and places that the financial sector historically has left out.\n\n\"Of course, no one program and no one administration can make good on the hopes and aspirations that Dr. King had for our country,\" Yellen said. \"There is still much more work Treasury needs to do to narrow the racial wealth divide.\"\n\nData backs up Yellen's sentiments that there is still vast work needed to be done to address race-based economic disparities -- many of which were heightened over the past year as the COVID-19 pandemic took a disproportionate toll on communities of color.\n\nThe insidious legacy of slavery in the U.S., as well as decades of racist policies that followed, results in systemic economic issues that are still present today -- such as the racial wealth gap, experts said. A Brookings Institution report published last year said that the net worth of a typical white family ($171,000) is nearly 10 times greater than that of a Black family ($17,150) in America, with researchers saying the gaps in wealth between Black and white households \"reveal the effects of accumulated inequality and discrimination, as well as differences in power and opportunity that can be traced back to this nation's inception.\"\n\nSeparate and more-recent data from the Federal Reserve indicated that in 2019, the typical White family has eight times the wealth of the typical Black family and five times the wealth of the typical Hispanic family. The Fed dataset indicates that in 2019, the median wealth of a white family in the U.S. was $188,200 and the median wealth of a Black family was some $24,100. The data notably is before the COVID-19 pandemic hit Black and Latino communities with inordinate furor and in many cases widened the gap between the haves and have-nots.\n\nThe central bank researchers said inheritance and inter-generational gifting of wealth, as well as investments families make in their children (such as paying for college tuition) are a big factor in their children's ability to accumulate wealth.\n\n\"For these reasons, wealth (or a lack thereof) can persist across generations and reflect, among other factors, a legacy of discrimination or unequal treatment in housing, education, and labor markets,\" the Fed researchers wrote .\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Young Black voters might be swing voters now\n\nBiden's support among young Black voters was weak. Can Harris win them back?\n\nBefore President Joe Biden exited the presidential race on July 21, pollsters had noticed a consistent trend : Black voters were less solidly in the Democratic camp than in recent elections, including 2020. The Republican Party took notice: During the Republican National Convention, speakers like Rep. John James and Madeline Brame made special efforts to appeal to this key constituency.\n\nBlack voters are at least 10 percent of the population in several of the states most likely to decide the 2024 election - from Pennsylvania to Michigan to Florida. They also loom large in Georgia and North Carolina, states that have been close in the recent past. So even small changes in Black Americans' support for Democrats could take key states off the table.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris's candidacy has the potential to win back Black voters who shifted away from Democrats when Biden was the nominee. But who exactly are these potential new Black swing voters? That's a hard question to answer, in part because polls are rarely optimized to target a demographic that is diverse and larger than the entire population of Canada. By comparing high-quality polls from 2008 to 2024, though, we can see that age has emerged as a major factor in Black voters' support for Democrats - with younger Black voters no longer as solidly in Democrats' camp.\n\nIt's unsurprising that the first Black president, Barack Obama, won more than 90 percent of Black voters during his own reelection bid in 2012 and enjoyed strong Black turnout , too. So, to get a baseline of Black voters' support for a white Democrat before former President Donald Trump came on the scene, we've got to look back to the 2008 primaries, when then-Sen. Hillary Clinton was one of the front-runners for the Democratic nomination.\n\nThat spring, before the nomination was set, the polling firm Knowledge Networks used population-based methods - surveying respondents online after recruiting them offline - to conduct a panel survey for the National Annenberg Election Survey . With a sample size of 9,888 in its spring 2008 wave alone, this survey had a large sample (962) of Black respondents. Overall, 75 percent of Black adults said they would vote for Clinton in a hypothetical general election matchup with then-Sen. John McCain, who got only 8 percent among Black adults. That's a 67-percentage-point gap.\n\nIn early 2024, however, the numbers looked quite different. Political scientist Gall Sigler and I partnered with NORC in February and March of this year to conduct a survey of the 2024 election that included 834 Black adults, and we found Biden led among these respondents by a smaller margin of 61 percent to 20 percent - a gap of only 41 points. (That wasn't far off a March/April YouGov poll of 2,004 Black or African American respondents conducted as part of the National Black Voter Project, which found Biden up 62 percent to 15 percent.) To be sure, that was still a massive pro-Democratic lean. But it was less than Democrats have enjoyed in the recent past.\n\nWhat changed between 2008 and 2024? A look at Black support by age reveals the answer. As you can see in the chart below, in 2008, Black support for Clinton and McCain was reasonably consistent across age groups. Clinton's support was between 67 and 84 percent among Black Americans across all age categories.\n\nBut by 2024, a clear age gap had opened up among Black Americans, at least when thinking about a Biden-Trump matchup. Older Black voters remained overwhelmingly Democratic: For example, Black respondents aged 65-74 supported Biden by 70 points. But as you can see in the next chart, younger Black voters favored Biden by much smaller margins. In fact, Black voters between 25 and 34 gave just about equal support to Biden and Trump.\n\nOf course, it's possible that the key factor wasn't age itself, but rather something correlated with age, like propensity to turn out to vote. Back in April, using the same data set, I found that Trump performed much better - and Biden much worse - among Black voters who turned out less frequently . Biden's margin over Trump was 81 points among Black voters who voted in 2018, 2020 and 2022, while it was only 10 points among those who voted in none of those three elections.\n\nYounger voters tend to turn out less consistently, so maybe Biden's underperformance with young voters was really a weakness with infrequent voters. But vote history wasn't the whole story. When we fit a linear regression model to account for the relationship between prior turnout and voter preference simultaneously, age-based differences in voter preference among Black voters were reduced but not eliminated.\n\nAnother factor could have been Black voters' personal experiences with politics. In theory, Black voters who were young adults during the civil-rights era might be especially loyal to the Democratic Party because of the party's role in passing landmark legislation like the 1965 Voting Rights Act when they were most impressionable . But if that were true, we might expect to see a discontinuity for people in their late 70s, since someone who is 77 today was 18 in 1965. Instead, the actual trend by age groups looked more like a straight line, suggesting that other processes were at work.\n\nIndeed, there are other factors that also vary with age and might explain the age gap we saw. Thirty years ago, political scientist Michael Dawson published the book \" Behind the Mule ,\" which argued that Black voters are an unusually cohesive voting bloc because of something called \"linked fate.\" To an important extent, Dawson wrote, Black Americans see their own opportunities as tethered to those of the Black community, so they vote overwhelmingly for the party they see as best for that community.\n\nIn the early 2024 survey, we measured this idea partly by asking Black respondents, \"Do you think what happens generally to Black people in this country will have something to do with what happens in your life, or not?\" Overall, our respondents tended to agree, with 75 percent saying what happens generally to Black people has \"a lot\" or \"some\" to do with their own life. But there was an age gap here too, albeit a more modest one: Black respondents aged 55-64 reported the highest sense of linked fate (79 percent), while those who were 18-24 reported the lowest (60 percent). It's plausible, then, that weaker perceptions of linked fate among younger Black voters helps explain the age gap in presidential support.\n\nBut let's be precise about the magnitude of the relationship. As respondents shifted from the lowest sense of linked fate (\"not at all\") to the highest (\"a lot\"), their support for Biden increased by about 0.11 on a 0-1 scale, according to a linear regression model. So linked fate was a part of the explanation, but it was not the whole story either. Even when we accounted for linked fate in statistical models, the age gap remained meaningful.*\n\nFor years, Democratic campaigns have devoted a lot of time and energy specifically to mobilizing Black voters. That will surely also be the case this year since, even if the Biden-level performance holds, Democrats will still benefit from high Black turnout - but some quick math shows us that those benefits may be dampened compared to prior years.\n\nIf Black voters as a whole cast more than 90 percent of their ballots for the Democrats, turning out 100 new Black voters will result in a net gain of 80 Democratic votes - that's assuming, though, a very high margin of Democratic victory among Black voters, and that the Black voters who only vote occasionally have the same levels of support as those who vote consistently. But if Black voters who wouldn't have otherwise voted are only with the Democrats by a margin of, say, 47 percent to 29 percent , turning out 100 new Black voters produces just 18 votes for Democrats on average. So if Democrats are losing the support of younger Black voters or less engaged Black voters, they may find that their get-out-the-vote efforts don't bear the same fruit as in past years.\n\nSophia Leung and Gall Sigler contributed research.\n\n*In these regression models, we also saw that women were about 0.07 points (on the same 0-1 scale) more pro-Biden and that neither income nor education was a strong predictor of Black respondents' presidential preference.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

And they actually viewed me as I'm being discriminated against. It's been pretty amazing,\" Trump said to applause.\n\nHe continued, asserting that Black people are starting to turn to him because \"what's happening to me, happens to them,\" centering his appeal to Black voters by equating his criminal prosecutions to the historic discrimination Black Americans have faced.\n\n\"I think that's why the Black people are so much on my side now because they see what's happening to me happens to them. Does that make sense?\"\n\nTrump is charged with 91 felony counts and faces charges including racketeering, conspiracy to obstruct justice and falsifying business records.\n\nThroughout the evening, Trump portrayed himself as a victim of an unjust criminal justice system which he said appeals to Black voters, especially in the Fulton County election interference case, where he was ordered to take a mugshot.\n\n\"My mug shot, we've all seen the mug shot. And you know who embraced it more than anybody else: the Black population. It's incredible,\" he said.\n\nTrump's comments come as he also likened himself to Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny in the wake of Navalny's death, saying the more than $350 million in penalties he faces in his New York civil fraud trial are a \"form of Navalny.\"\n\nTrump was joined on stage by the leaders of the organization as well as some of his Black political allies, including Reps. Byron Donalds and Wesley Hunt and his former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson who engaged with him repeatedly as he made off-the-cuff remarks.\n\n\"These lights are so bright in my eyes that I can't see too many people out there. But I can only see the Black ones. I can't see any white ones. You see, that's how far I've come. That's how far I've come,\" Trump said, quipping about a racial stereotype that Black people can't be seen in the dark as the lawmakers laughed behind him.\n\nThe ballroom was mainly filled with Black Republicans who seemed to enthusiastically cheer the former president on from their dinner tables.\n\n\"That's real,\" Kevin McGaray told ABC News. \"We get picked on all the time unnecessarily and, and he understands what that feels like now, so there's a connection.\"\n\nMcGary is a Black Republican from San Francisco. He voted for Trump in 2020 and 2016.\n\n\"I appreciate the track record that he has with the Black community,\" he said. \"Everything he did was on point for communities of color. So I appreciate that.\"\n\nMeanwhile onstage, Trump touted his policy appeals to the room which included boasting about his help in securing the passage of the First Step Act, a bipartisan criminal justice bill, and claimed he was able to help economic growth in the Black community.\n\nVoters like Karqueta Lindsey from Raleigh, North Carolina, don't like the way he compares his legal troubles to Black Americans. However she tells ABC News that his \"words\" on race are not a deal breaker.\n\n\"I'm not saying that everything that Donald Trump says that I'm for it, but I'm not for 100% of what any politician says,\" Lindsey said. \"I am pro-life and the borders need to be secured. So those are things that affect me, not the words.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

But for the Black Americans who are moving here, it's a dream.\n\nSo far, about 19 families, most of whom are from Georgia, have pooled their money to buy the nearly 97 acres of land in Wilkinson County, which is located about two hours south of Atlanta. It's their escape, they said, from the everyday racism that feels like a part of life in the United States.\n\nThe final push to make the move came this summer after seeing images of Black Americans like Jacob Blake in Wisconsin and Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia being gunned down by white police officers and white neighbors, many of them said.\n\n\"We came together and we said, 'You know what, we don't like being slaughtered in the streets. We don't like our children being there, being at the mercy of some psychopath that wants to tackle us and arrest us and bang our heads. We don't want that. So how about we just come together and build our own,'\" said Dr. Tabitha Ball, a licensed clinical psychologist from the Atlanta suburbs.\n\nRenee Walters and Ashley Scott started the campaign to buy Freedom after Walters saw a viral post about buying a town \"for the price of a New York apartment.\"\n\n\"So when I looked at it, I saw I had all these parcels and acres. I called my friend, [Ashley], who is one of the most amazing realtors in Atlanta, and I said, 'Sis, we have to go,'\" Walters said.\n\nThe people in Freedom include a range of professionals from doctors to real estate agents. Still, the group needs to build roads and establish running water and electricity before it can start building homes.\n\n\"We're not preaching separation and we're not preaching segregation. No, we just want to be safe, that's it,\" Ball said. \"Is that too much to ask for, just to be safe and happy and healthy? That's what this is about.\"\n\nThis is not the first time that people who felt persecuted or unwanted have pulled up stakes to settle somewhere new. Immigrants from Ireland, Italy and Germany all fled Europe and moved to the United States around the turn of the 20th century in hopes of building better lives, and created ethnic communities here.\n\nConservative Dutch communities left the motherland in the mid-1800s to set up Holland, Michigan. To this day, its tulip festival and iconic windmills are mainstays.\n\nBut those are examples of Americans who feel they can walk freely in this country, which, for many Black Americans, is still not the case today.\n\nThe Browns are one of many black families from across the country that came to see Freedom for themselves during an event that was held over the Labor Day Weekend. They drove down to Freedom from their home in Chicago.\n\n\"I think that if we want to feel safe [and] secure and be able to honor our culture, our heritage and plan for our children and not have to worry about what happens to them when they leave out the door, we have to ... not necessarily segregate, but have our own [space],\" Marissa Brown said.\n\n\"There are so many communities that have their own space, and it's not that we're anti-anything... We have to be pro-black love, and black love matters. Black community matters. Black power matters,\" Brown added.\n\nHistorian Kendra Taira Field, an associate professor of history at Tufts University in Massachusetts, underlines that Black Americans have tried to set up their own communities like Freedom before. She said the reason they've done this has been to escape racial violence, and pointed to examples in Nicodemus, Kansas; Eatonville, Florida; and Mound Bayou, Mississippi.\n\nShe said these all-Black communities sprung up at times when Black Americans were lynched and hung from trees in their neighborhoods.\n\n\"There's a really rich and long history of African American emigration both domestically and also abroad. For instance, [the] 'Back to Africa' moment, and [it's] almost always in response to ... the history of racial violence and economic exploitation in the U.S.,\" Field said.\n\nField said that Black Americans often decide to segregate themselves because, for them, it feels safer to only be surrounded by their own people. They feel it gives them a chance to thrive.\n\nField knows this personally; her family started an all-Black settlement in Oklahoma.\n\n\"Then when that fell through, and Oklahoma ended up looking a lot like Mississippi in terms of its Jim Crow laws, they were participating in a 'Back to Africa' movement,\" she said. \"They ended up helping to purchase a ship for $69,000 in 1913 and [1914], and actually migrating to the Gold Coast, which is now present-day Ghana.\"\n\nGhana has now produced one of the world's fastest growing economies, according to the International Monetary Fund. The African country's success ranks alongside several countries in Europe.\n\nIn recent years, Black Americans searching for a real-life Wakanda started moving to Ghana in droves.\n\nRashad McCrorey, 40, from Harlem in New York City, moved to Ghana during the COVID-19 pandemic to run his travel company, Africa Cross-Culture. He said he is now living his best life with no thoughts of looking back.\n\n\"I feel myself healing. I'm starting to see Black people with loving unity,\" McCrorey said. \"It's all part of this systematic injustice that put us in a condition where a lot of times we have to come out of America to heal -- to be places where we're not always the victim. We're not always in protection mode.\"\n\nFor the first time in his life, McCrorey said he is not afraid of the police. There, he said, he's seen citizens have altercations with officers without it ending in violence or death.\n\n\"Only in Ghana [do] I have police friends,\" he said. \"In America I refuse to have police friends, no matter what the ethnicity is ... and it comes from the system.\"\n\nEven the music he listens to in Ghana is different than in the states, he said.\n\n\"[With American music], it's drugs, drugs, murder, murder, you know, on everything. Here we're not hearing that on everything,\" McCrorey said. \"It's a lot of things going on in America that as Black Americans, we need to get away from sometime ... [and] see what real healthy living is about.\"\n\nFor those who are settling in Freedom, Georgia, it's a new beginning for them, too. Co-founder Ashley Scott says Black Americans today are suffering trauma and the solution for them is to get away.\n\n\"This land is to be an example and an inspiration to other families that you, too, can buy land together and create the village that you want for yourself,\" said Scott during a cookout and ribbon cutting for the new city.\n\n\"This is our village. We are a village of families and we happen to be Black families. But what we want is for all families to have an experience, that same power of doing something together and building something for ourselves. That is what this mission and this movement really is.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

And so far, there's no recovery in sight.\n\nOwning a home has long been a challenge for black families in the U.S. Generation after generation, institutional racism has made them targets for financial predation. In the middle of the 20th century, when the government effectively refused mortgage credit to black people, this took the form of contract-for-deed , a sort of rent-to-own arrangement that entailed all the burdens and none of the benefits of ownership. It later evolved into other schemes, such as the Federal Housing Administration machinations of the 1970s, in which an ill-designed federal loan program allowed speculators -- sometimes with the help of corrupt government officials -- to sell inner-city homes to black buyers at astronomical prices. The result: foreclosures, blighted neighborhoods and a persistent wealth gap between blacks and whites."

If you are not white, married, a man, a homeowner, and/or a wealthy corporate executive, the tax system has historically been a cinder block on your finances. This is a topic examined in great detail in Emory University law professor Dorothy A. Brown's recent book, The Whiteness of Wealth . Brown writes that U.S. tax policy has hampered, and at times erased, African Americans' ability to generate wealth, even when accounting for the various forms of tax reform passed over the years. It's not that tax policy is written with explicit discriminatory dimensions, but rather it has been drafted in ways that structurally advantage white households, especially those who live outside of central urban neighborhoods.\n\n\"Once I looked at the history of taxation in America, it became clear why so many tax policies have drastically different impacts on Black and white families,\" Brown writes in the book. \"They were created during a time when Black families paid into the system without having the same legal rights to live, work, marry, vote, or receive an education as their white peers.\""

Her mother, Dottie, having to battle prejudiced teachers, including one who marked down Dorothy's sister's grades so the precocious child wouldn't upstage her White classmates. Or the White cop beating a handcuffed Black man in the backseat of a cruiser, something she once observed while waiting to cross a street.\n\nAs a teenager, Brown thought she'd found a way out-a loophole in American racism. Taking an accounting class, the self-described math geek discovered the U.S. tax code, a universe governed by intricate rules where race wouldn't matter.

You having a little piece here and a little piece there.\"\n\nFor some Black Americans , they are pieces of a picture shattered by systemic racism.\n\nAt Alabama State University, Taylor spent decades as an archivist, sifting through documents where humans are only identified by numbers, names are misspelled and racially segregated records leave holes in family trees.\n\nBefore she died in July, Taylor hoped to impart on young people the importance of knowing your family history.\n\n\"Self-worth. That's important. You know, like I can sit here and tell you about my family all the way down to some parts of slavery. I feel proud of that,\" Taylor said.\n\nIn the decades after the Civil War, Black Americans owned an estimated 16 million acres of land, but by the turn of the century, 90% of that had been lost or stolen, amounting to a near $326 billion loss in wealth, according to the American Bar Association.\n\nTaylor said we won't ever know the full extent of enslaved people and their involvement, \"because the records are not there.\" Records are missing or obscured, making lines of ownership difficult to follow.\n\nTaylor helped Josephine Bolling McCall uncover the truth about her father's life and death.\n\n\"In doing family history, we start with ourselves and work backwards,\" Taylor said.\n\nElmore Bolling was lynched in 1947, when McCall was just 5 years old. He was a business man who was targeted by a white mob for his success.\n\n\"Some people were lynched for merely crossing the street in front of a White person,\" McCall said. \"My father was lynched because he was doing good. He had not committed a crime. They wanted to cut him down because he was making the wrong example for Blacks in the community.\"\n\nThat \"wrong example\" was simply \"achievement and helping others to achieve,\" she added.\n\nWith help from Taylor, McCall wrote a book documenting her father's story, a full story she didn't know until she was 35 years old. Despite the tragedy, she says she and her family were never angry.\n\nTaylor spoke to CBS News earlier this year as she was undergoing chemotherapy and had partially retired, but her passion for teaching was untouched. Up until her death, she continued to encourage the next generation to keep looking at the past, through her book and classes on how-to search the archives. At Alabama State, she worked with young librarians, by sharing her knowledge with archivists like Kashonda Murphy.\n\n\"The past is important, because it gives us insight into the future. If you don't know where you're from, I mean, you don't know what's ahead of you,\" Murphy said.\n\nIt's important work, even when it's painful or infuriating.\n\n\"It will make you mad,\" Taylor said. \"It'll make you where you do not want to do any more research. But who's gonna do it and document it so that grandkid, or that kid, can be proud of their family? Not what happened to them, but because of who they were.\"\n\nTaylor died at 79 years old after a battle with cancer. By her estimates, she helped nearly 10,000 people connect with their past.\n\nJames Brown is a special correspondent for CBS News. Brown has served as host for the CBS Television Network's NFL pre-game show, \"The NFL Today,\" and had served as play-by-play announcer for the Network's coverage of college basketball, including the NCAA Tournament.\n\n© 2024 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "text": "Report from National Urban League finds continued economic disparities among Black Americans\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nMarch 1, 2024 / 11:24 AM EST / CBS News\n\nNearly six decades after the Civil Rights Act outlawed discrimination based on race, religion, sex, and national origin, the 2024 State of Black America report assigns a score of just below 76% to the current level of equality between Black and White Americans - a figure indicating that, while progress has been made, significant disparities remain, according to Marc Morial, president of the National Urban League.\n\nMorial said the National Urban League's report evaluates data that includes unemployment, death rates, health insurance coverage and economic indicators. The findings suggest that Black Americans earn significantly less than White people, with a median family income of $45,000 compared to $75,000 for Whites.\n\n\"At that rate, we're 180 years away from parity,\" said Morial, who is former mayor of New Orleans.\n\nSince the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Morial said that while \"there are those who push for progress, there have also been those who pushed against progress, witnessed today in over 1,000 bills that have been introduced in state legislatures to make it more difficult to vote.\"\n\nMorial said cited challenges to diversity and inclusion initiatives as examples of resistance to equality.\n\n\"I mean, there is a resistance movement to the kinds of change that the nation needs,\" Morial said. \"And there was one in 1964. And there's one in 2024, and it's intensified.\"\n\nMorial called for action to accelerate the closing of the racial gap, emphasizing the need for unrestricted access to voting and economic reforms to address poverty and wealth disparities. He also highlighted the need to have support for children, such as the expired child tax credit that Morial said cut in half child poverty rates in its brief time period.\n\n\"What's dramatic is that the Civil Rights Act of '64, the Voting Rights Act of '65, the Great Society programs in the middle 1960s, probably cut the American poverty rate in half in a 15-year period,\" Morial said. \"So can we?

Harvard researcher David Williams has spent his career showing what the CDC now recognizes: racism itself can be a killer.\n\nProfessor David R. Williams: Imagine a fully loaded jumbo jet with 220 passengers and crew taking off and crashing today. And the same thing happened every day next week and every day next month and every day for the rest of the year. That's exactly what is occurring when we say there are racial disparities in health in the United States. Over 200 Black people dying prematurely every single day.\n\nDr. David Williams, who is originally from the Carribean island of St. Lucia, is a professor of public health at Harvard and chairman of its Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences. He has spent a quarter-century researching the corrosive impact that racism has on the health of people of color all around the world.\n\nBill Whitaker: You have conducted rigorous psychological, sociological, scientific studies of this phenomenon?\n\nProfessor David R. Williams: That's correct. We've done studies in South Africa. There're colleagues doing studies in Australia, studies in the U.K., studies across the world. And we find in all of these contexts, empirically, statistically that experiences of discrimination are directly impacting health.\n\nCan something as complex and subjective as racial discrimination really be measured? Williams insists it can with a test that he created nearly 25 years ago.\n\nBill Whitaker: What is the Everyday Discrimination Scale?\n\nProfessor David R. Williams: The Everyday Discrimination Scale is-- a measure, a nine item measure, it has items like you're treated with less courtesy than others. You're treated with less respect than others. You receive poorer service than others in restaurants or stores. People act as if they're afraid of you. It's little ways in which your dignity is chipped away on a daily basis. And what we are finding is that persons who score high on the Everyday Discrimination Scale have a broad range of-- of adverse health conditions. It predicts high blood pressure. It predicts the onset of diabetes. It predicts incidence of cardiovascular disease. It predicts poorer mental health.\n\nProfessor Williams has demonstrated that the health of Black Americans suffers whether they are rich or poor, well-educated or not. Black women with college degrees are more likely to see their babies die as infants than White women who didn't finish high school. Another stark example? The 1970 graduating class at Yale.\n\nBill Whitaker: The Black graduates were three times more likely to die prematurely than their White classmates--\n\nProfessor David R. Williams: That's correct. I mean that's the magnitude of some of the racial disparities in health we see.\n\nBill Whitaker: Just to make this abundantly clear. A Black man or woman-- with a college degree, making a lot of money, is less well off, health-wise, than a White man or woman in the same category, under the same circumstances?\n\nProfessor David R. Williams: Absolutely.\n\nDavid Williams' research shows that even when treated in the same health care settings, Black Americans are less well-cared-for than Whites.\n\nProfessor David R. Williams: One researcher coined the term \"weathering\" to describe what is happening to African Americans. Imagine a drop of water falling from the rooftop of this building to the concrete sidewalk below. If the water drips today, it's no big deal. But if day in, day out, week in, week out, year in, year out there is a constant drip, drip, drip of water, the sidewalk, the concrete below would become weathered. It becomes eroded by the constant exposure to adversity. And so what the research is suggesting, that all of these stressors are weathering African Americans in the same way.\n\nMichelle Thomas: I can't change the color I am. And I can't change the color my kids are. And I can't, you know, change the way people see us.\n\nMichelle Thomas is a single mom raising six kids in Atlanta. She has felt the drip, drip, drip of all of racism's \"stressors.\"\n\nMichelle Thomas:  You see the Confederate flag being flown. You see people driving by are calling you the N-word. And you're just walking down the street. I don't know any other race that actually say they have to have a talk with their kids about how to handle yourself when you're in the street or how to handle yourself around a police officer or how to handle yourself when you go shopping in a store. Make sure your hands are not in your pocket.\n\nShe points to a particularly painful moment in 2019 when her teenage son Jerome, who is on the autism spectrum, was stopped and handcuffed by Atlanta police who said he fit the profile of a robbery suspect.\n\nMichelle Thomas: I'm like, \"If you talked to him for a little while, you would know for a fact that my son had had autism. But you didn't get a chance to know my son. You just assumed that he was the criminal. And that broke my heart.\n\nBill Whitaker: What was the impact on your son? What did it do to him?\n\nMichelle Thomas: He was, like, \"Mom, did I do something wrong?\" And I'm, like, \"No baby. You did nothing wrong. It's just your skin.\" And he's, like, \"Well, you think this is gonna happen to me again?\" And -- you know, I had to say. And I'm, like, \"Yes. Nine-- nine times out of ten this is gonna happen to you plenty of times in your lifetime.\"\n\nShirley Franklin: People are really tired of these two Americas. They want to do something different.\n\nShirley Franklin served two terms as mayor of Atlanta, and then as board chair of purpose-built communities, an organization trying to improve health outcomes for African Americans by investing in Black neighborhoods.\n\nBill Whitaker: Dr. Williams told us that there is a 20 to 25-year gap in life expectancy based on the communities we live in. That's a remarkable number.\n\nShirley Franklin: The life expectancy numbers are startling and they are horrific.\n\nOne of the places where Franklin's group is trying to change those numbers is historic South Atlanta, the neighborhood of about 2,000 people where Michelle Thomas and her kids now live.\n\nShirley Franklin: We determined that there were three key pillars. One is community wellness and community health with a sense of community spirit. Another is accessible affordable housing. And the third is education.\n\nProfessor David R. Williams: If we can improve the living conditions of individuals, we actually can improve their health. Let me give you an example of a study that was done years ago.  Where they took African Americans who lived in public housing and randomly, by the flip of a coin, some of them remain in -- public housing, and some of them were given a voucher where they could go and find housing in areas of-- of lower levels of poverty than where they currently were. Research shows ten to 15 years later those African Americans who moved to a better neighborhood had lower rates of obesity-- and lower diabetes risk. No health intervention. You just changed their neighborhood.\n\nA crucial factor in that equation is access to healthy foods. For years, South Atlanta - like many Black neighborhoods - was what's known as a food desert, with no nearby grocery store. Katie Delp, whose neighborhood nonprofit works with former Mayor Franklin's group, says she tried to convince grocery chains to open a store.\n\nBill Whitaker: You approached, like, every major supermarket chain to ask them if they would build a supermarket -- in the neighborhood, and they all said no?\n\nKatie Delp: They all said no.\n\nBill Whitaker: Why?\n\nKatie Delp: The community does not have enough disposable income for a large supermarket. So it doesn't work for their model.\n\nSo Delp and her colleagues decided to build a smaller one of their own. In 2015 they opened Carver Market with Community Grounds, a coffee shop, in the same building.\n\nBill Whitaker: Do you remember your reaction the first time you saw or walked into Carver Market?\n\nMichelle Thomas: Yeah. I was blown away. Like, it has a cafe here and there's a -- grocery store. I'm, like, \"Wow.\" And I'm, like, \"This area is a food desert. And we got somethin' like th--\" I was, like, \"Thank God. Amen.\" I was so happy.\n\nBill Whitaker: Just the things you're saying, to be able to walk into a store and get fresh vegetables and fruits, and have a coffee shop, that's something many Americans just take for granted. And that's not something that is available to everybody.\n\nMichelle Thomas: Yes. It's not. And it's sad. And it should be.\n\nProfessor David R. Williams: To have grocery stores that provide affordable access to high quality foods is a good thing from a health and nutrition point of view. But in addition to that, it provides employment opportunities. And really-- a job is a good health-enhancing strategy.\n\nThat has been precisely Michelle Thomas's experience in South Atlanta.\n\nBill Whitaker: You didn't just wanna shop at Carver Market.\n\nMichelle Thomas: No. I wanted to be a part of Carver Market. \"How can I apply? How can I get started?\"\n\nBill Whitaker: What was your first job?\n\nMichelle Thomas: My first job was a barista.\n\nBill Whitaker: So what is your job now?\n\nMichelle Thomas: I'm assistant-- general manager of - of-- Carver Market. (LAUGH)\n\nThe health benefits that a nearby grocery store can provide have been proven in neighborhod after neighborhood. MichelleThomas says she sees it in her own family, compared to the food-desert where she used to live.\n\nMichelle Thomas: I could never get fresh fruit and vegetables the same day that I needed them. With Carver Market, I can actually just walk down the street like five blocks and I have fresh vegetables, fresh fruit. And that's the point. You want to give your kids something healthy.\n\nEven with all the progress in South Atlanta, there's fresh trauma, too. Last June, Rayshard Brooks was shot and killed by an Atlanta police officer just a half-mile from the Carver Market. In the unrest that followed, the market was vandalized. But that wasn't the whole story.\n\nKatie Delp: One thing that struck me the morning-- after the vandalism is that we had neighbors everywhere, you know, sweeping up glass, scrubbing off graffiti-- boarding up windows.\n\nMichelle Thomas: We came together. You wouldn't believe how many neighbors came together. And if you see that many people, you know you're at a good place.\n\nThat same week, Michelle Thomas and her neighbors held a peaceful march that drew a stark contrast to the violence. They painted murals over graffiti and started bike rides to occupy neighborhood kids idled by the pandemic. And recently, more than 400 neighborhood residents got a COVID vaccine during a one-day pop-up clinic.\n\nMichelle Thomas: We're more than just a neighborhood. We're more than just people. We're a family. And once-- you have a family, hey, you have everything.\n\nSouth Atlanta is now one of almost 30 neighborhoods around the country that are part of the purpose-built communities network, all of them working to undo or at least mitigate the damage done by decades - centuries, really - of segregation and racism.\n\nBill Whitaker: If you're working community by community, this is gonna take a long time to reach your goals. I mean, people are clamoring for change right now.\n\nShirley Franklin: It took 400 years to get into this desperate situation. So your question about whether we do it one at a time-- doesn't sit too well with me. Because we didn't get here overnight. And it's gonna take some, it's gonna take some time to get out of this dilemma.\n\nProduced by Rome Hartman and Sara Kuzmarov. Field producers, Miles Doran and Cristina Gallotto.

      "text": "Late genealogist remembered for work uncovering Black Americans' family histories\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nSeptember 12, 2024 / 8:02 PM EDT / CBS News\n\nMontgomery, Alabama - Scanning through archives may seem like a daunting task, but if you know what you're looking for - like genealogist Frazine Taylor did - small clues quickly reveal the story of a real person.\n\n\"I used to like detective stories,\" Taylor said. \"That's what family history is. You having a little piece here and a little piece there.\"\n\nFor some Black Americans , they are pieces of a picture shattered by systemic racism.\n\nAt Alabama State University, Taylor spent decades as an archivist, sifting through documents where humans are only identified by numbers, names are misspelled and racially segregated records leave holes in family trees.\n\nBefore she died in July, Taylor hoped to impart on young people the importance of knowing your family history.\n\n\"Self-worth. That's important. You know, like I can sit here and tell you about my family all the way down to some parts of slavery. I feel proud of that,\" Taylor said.\n\nIn the decades after the Civil War, Black Americans owned an estimated 16 million acres of land, but by the turn of the century, 90% of that had been lost or stolen, amounting to a near $326 billion loss in wealth, according to the American Bar Association.\n\nTaylor said we won't ever know the full extent of enslaved people and their involvement, \"because the records are not there.\" Records are missing or obscured, making lines of ownership difficult to follow.\n\nTaylor helped Josephine Bolling McCall uncover the truth about her father's life and death.\n\n\"In doing family history, we start with ourselves and work backwards,\" Taylor said.\n\nElmore Bolling was lynched in 1947, when McCall was just 5 years old. He was a business man who was targeted by a white mob for his success.\n\n\"Some people were lynched for merely crossing the street in front of a White person,\" McCall said. \"My father was lynched because he was doing good. He had not committed a crime. They wanted to cut him down because he was making the wrong example for Blacks in the community.\"\n\nThat \"wrong example\" was simply \"achievement and helping others to achieve,\" she added.\n\nWith help from Taylor, McCall wrote a book documenting her father's story, a full story she didn't know until she was 35 years old. Despite the tragedy, she says she and her family were never angry.\n\nTaylor spoke to CBS News earlier this year as she was undergoing chemotherapy and had partially retired, but her passion for teaching was untouched. Up until her death, she continued to encourage the next generation to keep looking at the past, through her book and classes on how-to search the archives. At Alabama State, she worked with young librarians, by sharing her knowledge with archivists like Kashonda Murphy.\n\n\"The past is important, because it gives us insight into the future. If you don't know where you're from, I mean, you don't know what's ahead of you,\" Murphy said.\n\nIt's important work, even when it's painful or infuriating.\n\n\"It will make you mad,\" Taylor said. \"It'll make you where you do not want to do any more research. But who's gonna do it and document it so that grandkid, or that kid, can be proud of their family? Not what happened to them, but because of who they were.\"\n\nTaylor died at 79 years old after a battle with cancer. By her estimates, she helped nearly 10,000 people connect with their past.\n\nJames Brown is a special correspondent for CBS News. Brown has served as host for the CBS Television Network's NFL pre-game show, \"The NFL Today,\" and had served as play-by-play announcer for the Network's coverage of college basketball, including the NCAA Tournament.\n\n© 2024 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "text": "Report finds democracy for Black Americans is under attack\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nApril 15, 2023 / 1:16 PM EDT / AP\n\nExtreme views adopted by some local, state and federal political leaders who try to limit what history can be taught in schools and seek to undermine how Black officials perform their jobs are among the top threats to democracy for Black Americans, the National Urban League says.\n\nMarc Morial, the former New Orleans mayor who leads the civil rights and urban advocacy organization, cited the most recent example: the vote this month by the Republican-controlled Tennessee House to oust two Black representatives for violating a legislative rule. The pair had participated in a gun control protest inside the chamber after the shooting that killed three students and three staff members at a Nashville school .\n\n\"We have censorship and Black history suppression, and now this,\" Morial said in an interview. \"It's another piece of fruit of the same poisonous tree, the effort to suppress and contain.\"\n\nBoth Tennessee lawmakers were quickly reinstated by leaders in their districts and were back at work in the House after an uproar that spread well beyond the state.\n\nThe Urban League's annual State of Black America report being released Saturday draws on data and surveys from a number of organizations, including the UCLA Law School, the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League. The collective findings reveal an increase in recent years in hate crimes and efforts to change classroom curriculums, attempts to make voting more difficult and extremist views being normalized in politics, the military and law enforcement.\n\nOne of the most prominent areas examined is so-called critical race theory . Scholars developed it as an academic framework during the 1970s and 1980s in response to what they viewed as a lack of racial progress following the civil rights legislation of the 1960s. The theory centers on the idea that racism is systemic in the nation's institutions and that they function to maintain the dominance of white people in society.\n\nDirector Taifha Alexander said the Forward Tracking Project , part of the UCLA Law School, began in response to the backlash that followed the protests of the George Floyd killing in 2020 and an executive order that year from then-President Donald Trump restricting diversity training.\n\nThe project's website shows that 209 local, state and federal government entities have introduced more than 670 bills, resolutions, executive orders, opinion letters, statements and other measures against critical race theory since September 2020.\n\nAnti-critical race theory is \"a living organism in and of itself. It's always evolving. There are always new targets of attack,\" Alexander said.\n\nShe said the expanded scope of some of those laws, which are having a chilling effect on teaching certain aspects of the country's racial conflicts, will lead to major gaps in understanding history and social justice.\n\n\"This anti-CRT campaign is going to frustrate our ability to reach our full potential as a multiracial democracy\" because future leaders will be missing information they could use to tackle problems, Alexander said.\n\nShe said one example is the rewriting of Florida elementary school material about civil rights figure Rosa Parks and her refusal to give up her seat to a white rider on a Montgomery, Alabama, bus in 1955 - an incident that sparked the bus boycott there. Mention of race was omitted entirely in one revision, a change first reported by The New York Times.\n\nFlorida has been the epicenter of many of the steps, including opposing AP African American studies , but it's not alone.\n\n\"The things that have been happening in Florida have been replicated, or governors in similarly situated states have claimed they will do the same thing,\" Alexander said.\n\nIn Alabama, a proposal to ban \"divisive\" concepts passed out of legislative committee this past week. Last year, the administration of Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, rescinded a series of policies, memos and other resources related to diversity, equity and inclusion that it characterized as \"discriminatory and divisive concepts\" in the state's public education system.\n\nOklahoma public school teachers are prohibited from teaching certain concepts of race and racism under a bill Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt signed into law in 2021.\n\nOn Thursday, the Llano County Commissioners Court in Texas held a special meeting to consider shutting down the entire public library system rather than follow a federal judge's order to return a slate of books to the shelves on topics ranging from teenage sexuality to bigotry.\n\nAfter listening to public comments in favor and against the shutdown, the commissioners decided to remove the item from the agenda.\n\n\"We will suppress your books. We will suppress the conversation about race and racism, and we will suppress your history, your AP course,\" Morial said. \"It is singular in its effort to suppress Blacks.\"\n\nOther issues in his group's report address extremism in the military and law enforcement, energy and climate change, and how current attitudes can affect public policy. Predominantly white legislatures in Missouri and Mississippi have proposals that would shift certain government authority from some majority Black cities to the states.\n\nIn many ways, the report mirrors concerns evident in recent years in a country deeply divided over everything from how much K-12 students should be taught about racism and sexuality to the legitimacy of the 2020 election.\n\nForty percent of voters in last year's elections said their local K-12 public schools were not teaching enough about racism in the United States, while 34% said it already was too much, according to AP VoteCast, an expansive survey of the American electorate. Twenty-three percent said the current curriculum was about right.\n\nAbout two-thirds of Black voters said more should be taught on the subject, compared with about half of Latino voters and about one-third of white voters.\n\nViolence is one of the major areas of concern covered in the Urban League report, especially in light of the 2022 mass shooting at a grocery store in Buffalo, New York . The accused shooter left a manifesto raising the \"great replacement theory \" as a motive in the killings.\n\nData released this year by the FBI indicated that hate crimes rose between 2020 and 2021. African Americans were disproportionately represented, accounting for 30% of the incidents in which the bias was known.\n\nBy comparison, the second largest racial group targeted in the single incident category was white victims, who made up 10%.\n\nRachel Carroll Rivas, deputy director of research with the Southern Poverty Law Center's Intelligence Project, said when all the activities are tabulated, including hate crimes, rhetoric, incidents of discrimination and online disinformation, \"we see a very clear and concerning threat to America and a disproportionate impact on Black Americans.\"\n\n© 2023 The Associated Press.

      "text": "\"If a race has no history ... it stands in danger of being exterminated.\" Meet Carter G. Woodson, the \"Father of Black History\"\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nFebruary 6, 2021 / 11:50 PM EST / CBS News\n\nCarter G. Woodson, known as the \"Father of Black History,\" is given much credit for the creation of Black History Month, a federally recognized celebration during the month of February of the impact African Americans have had and the contributions they have made in the United States. It is also a time to reflect on the continued efforts African Americans make to fight for racial justice and equality among people of color.\n\nThroughout his life, Woodson, who was born in 1875, dedicated his work to educating African Americans on their heritage.\n\nThe son of former slaves, Woodson spent most of his childhood working in coal mines in Huntington, West Virginia. After teaching himself English and arithmetic, he graduated from Berea College in 1903 and went on to earn his master's degree in history from the University of Chicago.\n\nHe later earned a doctorate in history from Harvard , making him the second Black American to graduate with a PhD from the university, and the only person of enslaved parents to earn a PhD in history from any institution in the United States, according to the National Park Service.\n\nTroubled by the lack of information about the accomplishments of African Americans, Woodson in 1915 founded the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History, an organization now called the Association for the Study of African American Life and History, to write Black Americans into the nation's history.\n\nWoodson believed it was imperative for young African Americans to understand their history and be proud of their culture.\n\n\"If a race has no history, if it has no worthwhile tradition, it becomes a negligible factor in the thought of the world, and it stands in danger of being exterminated,\" Woodson wrote in \"The Mis-Education of the Negro,\" published in 1933.\n\nIn 1926, Woodson helped create the first Negro History Week, which was held during the second week of February to coincide with the birthdays of Frederick Douglass, an abolitionist who himself escaped from slavery, and former President Abraham Lincoln. Though his true date of birth isn't known, Douglass celebrated his birthday on February 14, while Lincoln was born February 12.\n\nThe week influenced communities nationwide to organize performances and lectures focused on Black history, and establish history clubs in schools. Decades later, city mayors began to issue yearly proclamations to recognize Negro History Week, according to The Association for the Study of African American Life and History. By the late 1960s, Negro History Week evolved into Black History Month on college campuses. But it wasn't until 1976 that then-President Gerald Ford formally recognized Black History Month during the celebration of the United States Bicentennial.\n\n\"In celebrating Black History Month, we can take satisfaction from this recent progress in the realization of the ideals envisioned by our Founding Fathers,\" Ford said in a February 10 speech . \"But, even more than this, we can seize the opportunity to honor the too-often neglected accomplishments of Black Americans in every area of endeavor throughout our history.\"\n\nThe Association for the Study of African American Life and History dedicates its time to promoting, preserving and disseminating information about Black history, culture and life, according to its stated mission . It also selects a theme for Black History Month each year that reflects how people of African descent in the United States have viewed themselves, the influence of social movements on racial ideologies, and the aspirations of the Black community.\n\nThis year's theme is The Black Family: Representation, Identity, and Diversity.\n\n© 2021 CBS Interactive Inc.

Black families had $24,100 in wealth in 2019 compared to $188,200 in White families, according to Federal Reserve data .\n\nHiring more Black workers for higher-earning jobs at major companies will help shrink that gap, Frazier said. That could begin to \"eliminate some of the systemic barriers that African-Americans have faced,\" he said.\n\nThe Black Lives Matter protests that erupted soon after the police killing of George Floyd have pushed companies to publicly denounce racism. Companies have also vowed to hire more people of color and diversify their workplaces. Adidas, Best Buy and Wells Fargo have all announced diversity hiring targets .\n\n\"After the whole George Floyd killing, conversations were happening across kitchen tables as well as boardroom tables,\" Frazier said.\n\nKhristopher J.

      "text": "Why some Black Americans are skeptical of a COVID-19 vaccine\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nDecember 11, 2020 / 8:29 PM EST / CBS News\n\nCOVID-19 has disproportionately ravaged Black communities across America. Black Americans are three times more likely to die from the virus than Whites and more than 48,000 have died since the beginning of the pandemic. But as the U.S. moves closer to approving a coronavirus vaccine, public health officials are working to confront the long history of racism and mistreatment of Black Americans to sell them on a vaccine.\n\nStudies suggest the Black community is \"less inclined\" to take the vaccine than any other racial group, according to a Pew Research Center study published this month. Of the 12,648 adults surveyed, only 42% of Black Americans would consider taking the vaccine, compared to 63% of Hispanics, 61% of White adults, and 83% of English-speaking Asian Americans who would.\n\nThe Black community's distrust of the vaccine and the nation's medical establishment is rooted in a long record of mistreatment. The late 1900s were defined by medical breakthroughs in the nation's scientific community, but many of these experiments and discoveries were made at \"the expense of Black people's human dignity,\" said Dr. Reed Tuckson, co-founder of the Black Coalition Against COVID-19. \"There is a history of insults that have occurred in health care for people of color.\"\n\nIn 1951, Henrietta Lacks, a woman suffering from cervical cancer , went to Johns Hopkins Hospital for treatment. When doctors took samples of her cancer cells, they discovered that her cells doubled at a rapid rate unseen before, making them ideal for cancer research. Since 1951, these \"HeLa\" cells, named after the first two letters in her first and last name, have been used to make advances in biomedical research.\n\nBut Lacks' cells were used without her knowledge or consent and her family failed to receive any funds from the companies that used the \"HeLa\" cells to make medical discoveries.\n\nAnother infamous example: the Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment, a 1931 study conducted by the Public Health Service and Tuskegee Institute that examined the progression of syphilis in Black men.\n\nIn 1972, an Associated Press report revealed the hundreds of men participating were misled about the experiment and went untreated - even penicillin was withheld when it became the standard treatment for the disease in 1947.  The men and their families were later granted a $10 million settlement and health benefits for their descendants from the federal government but the incident remains on the forefront of the Black community's mind.\n\nEarlier this week, Dr. Anthony Fauci said he fully respects the underlying skepticism of Black Americans but said it would be tragic for Black Americans to miss out on the benefits of the vaccines. \"The terrible and shameful things that happened a long time ago are inexcusable,\" Fauci said Tuesday. \"It would be doubly tragic that the lingering effects of that prevent you from doing something so important.\"\n\n\"The time is now to put skepticism aside,\" Fauci said. \"You'll be saving yourself and your family illness, as well as that of your community.\"\n\nWhile these areas of distrust are historical examples, studies show Black Americans still face implicit racial bias and discrimination among health care providers. In underserved communities, Black individuals are less likely to have access to dedicated primary care doctors, a lack of health care that is directly linked to higher cases of chronic, unmanaged diseases in the Black community.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., Black residents make up roughly 46% of the population, but over 80% of virus deaths. In Chicago, Black residents died at six times the rate of White residents.\n\nFor twin sisters and doctors Delana Wardlaw and Elana McDonald, the lack of trusted Black doctors and poor primary care access in underserved communities are some of the biggest reasons the Black community is being hit hardest by COVID-19.\n\nPoor or no access to regular healthcare can lead to a lack of diagnoses of chronic diseases, such as diabetes, asthma, high blood pressure, heart disease, and kidney disease - all conditions the CDC says puts people at greater risk for the virus.\n\nWardlaw and McDonald believe Black physicians can play an important and personal role in reducing the Black community's fears and concerns about the COVID-19 crises, something they consider a \"valuable\" part of the education process.\n\nThe sisters established community COVID-19 testing in Philadelphia, where Black residents contract the virus at twice the rate of White Philly residents and make up over 55% of those hospitalized for COVID-19.\n\n\"The goal is to make sure that patients have adequate information, they are considering all the concerns, all the information and the options that are available so that we can make sure that we're not allowing history to allow us to become a statistic,\" said Wardlaw.\n\nEven further, clinical trials for both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines lack Black, Brown, and indigenous participants, as Black individuals make up only 10% and 8% respectively of their trial participants, a shortcoming that many in the Black community have cited as a reason for distrust.\n\nDr. Gary Gibbons, director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute at the National Institute of Health, said increasing the diversity of vaccine trials is essential to demonstrating trust to the Black community and ensuring the vaccine is effective for all people.\n\n\"It's so critically important that the same communities that are so adversely affected by a disease, or in this case a pandemic, be included in the research designed to establish what is safe and effective, to more effectively treat or prevent this disease,\" said Gibbons.\n\nAround the country, Black health leaders, researchers, clergy, and advocates are working together to reduce the fears of potential vaccine participants. One such group: The Black Coalition Against COVID-19, has created a series of town halls directly addressing residents' questions and concerns.\n\n\"It is our hope and conclusion there that by talking regularly and consistently with the Black community from a love-based, trusted and scientifically valid perspective, that we, in fact, should make a big difference in how many people are thinking about these issues and making choices and decisions for themselves, their families and their communities,\" said Tuckson.\n\nIn New York City, the Ali Forney Center, a shelter dedicated to homeless LGBTQ+ youth, is working to stop the spread of misinformation surrounding the virus. The center recently transformed its education platform to focus on vaccine education.\n\n\" It's especially important to note for this population, our young people have been let down by society,\" said Alex Roque, the center's director. \"And if you lose that faith and when you lose that faith in the people who are supposed to love you, who do you trust after that?\"\n\nAmbrose Lane Jr., Chair of the Health Alliance, the largest community-based health advocacy group in Washington, D.C., said his group is working to educate Black residents on the vaccine. Lane said he is hopeful that renewed attention to medical distrust will help combat COVID-19 vaccine fears and the larger distrust of the nation's scientific community.\n\n\"If we take this opportunity now to be able to really focus on addressing those disparities in our communities, we will have a better health care system and we will be prepared for the next time,\" said Lane. \"Because eventually, there will be a next time.\"\n\n© 2020 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "text": "The Black church is having a moment\n\nThe Rev. Jemar Tisby describes himself as a \"theological mutt.\" He was baptized in a Southern Baptist church, joined a White nondenominational congregation and spent much of his time attending Catholic schools.\n\nBut once he attended a small Black Baptist church in the Mississippi Delta, he found a home. Located in a former warehouse, the church had concrete floors, metal folding chairs for pews and an elderly congregation of only about 12 people.\n\nWhat they lacked in size, though, they made up for in spiritual fervor. When members of the congregation began to \"feel the spirit,\" they cried, moaned and swayed while singing spirituals like \"Wade in the Water.\"\n\n\"It was if you were hearing the echoes of the ancestors,\" says Tisby, author of \" How To Fight Racism: Courageous Christianity and the Journey Toward Racial Justice .\" \"It was almost like you were transported back in time. There was a dignity and ancestral strength that they tapped into.\"\n\nThe Black church rituals that Tisby celebrates are in the national spotlight this week. For over 400 years, the Black church has been the central institution in the African American community, but many of its customs remain a mystery to outsiders. New research and a new documentary film could help change that.\n\nThe Pew Research Center on Tuesday is publishing a major study, \" Faith Among Black Americans ,\" that takes a sweeping look at African Americans' religious beliefs and practices. On Tuesday night PBS will premiere \" The Black Church: This is Our Story, This is Our Song ,\" a two-part documentary series produced and hosted by scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr.\n\nFeaturing interviews from such luminaries as Oprah Winfrey, singer John Legend and social critic Cornel West, the series examines \"the world within a world\" of the Black church's distinctive style of preaching, gospel music and blending of African faith traditions with Christianity.\n\n\"The Black church gave people a sense of value, belonging and worthiness,\" Winfrey says in the special. \"I don't know how we could have survived as a people without it.\"\n\nThe Pew study and the PBS special arrive as the Black church is helping transform American politics. Black churchgoers played a critical role in President Biden's victory and helped Democrats win control of the US Senate with the election of Raphael Warnock, a Black pastor who preaches in the same Atlanta pulpit that the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. once occupied.\n\nAfter four years of White evangelicals grabbing headlines, the Black church is getting its due.\n\nThe phrase \"the Black Church\" has long been used by Black scholars and clergy as an umbrella term for all historically Black Protestant denominations as well as nondenominational churches with predominantly Black congregations, Pew says.\n\nThe new study, Pew's most comprehensive look at the religious practices of Black Americans, is based on interviews with at least 8,660 Black adults. For comparative purposes, researchers also posed some of the same questions to 4,574 Americans of other races.\n\nIt found that Black people are more religious than other groups in the US. While 90% of Americans overall in believe in God or a higher power, 97% of Black adults believe in the same, Pew says. And while 54% of Americans surveyed believe \"evil spirits can harm,\" 73% of Black adults say the same.\n\nBlack Americans are also more likely to say religion is \"very important\" in their lives, and to believe prayers to ancestors have protective power, the survey found. Most Black adults regularly engage in personal prayer, with 63% saying they pray at least once a day.\n\nThe Black church is also known for its unique culture. The study found that Black Protestants are far more likely than Black adults of other faiths to go to a church that features highly expressive worship: dancing in the aisles, speaking in tongues and shouts of \"amen!\"\n\nThe study also explores an integral facet of the Black church: Its stance on social justice. As Pew discovered, that activism remains essential to many African Americans.\n\nAt least 44% of Protestant Black churchgoers said they heard a sermon, lecture or discussion on race relations or racial inequality in the last year while 29% of all adults heard a sermon on the same topics during the same time period.\n\n\"Most Black Christians say that opposing racism is essential to being a Christian,\" says Besheer Mohamed, who co-authored the report along with Kiana Cox, Jeff Diamant and Claire Gecewicz.\n\nThe PBS special tells the story behind those numbers, describing the Black church as an \"engine for social justice.\" Many of the country's best-known civil rights leaders - King, Frederick Douglass, the activist Fannie Lou Hamer - were motivated primarily by their Christian faith and the Black church's tradition of speaking truth to power.\n\n\"This is the story and song our ancestors bequeathed to us,\" says Gates , host of the PBS special. \"No social institution in the Black community is more central and important than the Black church.\"\n\nThe Black church's emphasis on social justice may seem baffling to outsiders who think churches shouldn't get involved in politics. But the Black church was forged during the crucible of slavery.\n\nEnslaved Africans drew hope from stories like Moses leading the children of Israel out of bondage. For them, Christianity was about liberation from injustice, not just personal sin.\n\nFor decades the Black church was the only independent institution in the Black community that had the sufficient numbers and resources to push for social change, says Tisby, the pastor and author. Today groups like Black Lives Matter aren't as dependent on the Black church and can mobilize people on social media, he says.\n\nThat may explain some trends in the Pew survey. Despite the Black church's key place in Black life, almost half (47%) of African Americans believe that predominately Black churches are less influential today than they were 50 years ago. Only 30% think they are more influential.\n\nThe study also found that that younger Black adults are less religious and less involved in Black churches than older generations. About half of Black adults born after 1996 attend a Black church, compared to two-thirds of Black Baby Boomers.\n\nStill, the Black church still wields tremendous power and resources. The church's ability to influence the 2020 election is evidence of that, Tisby says.\n\n\"The Black church isn't the only outlet for organizing and protest, but it remains the central outlet,\" he says.\n\nTisby says he is not worried about the long-term mission of the Black church. All he has to do is look at the headlines. He cites how many White evangelical churches threw their support behind former President Trump.\n\n\"I don't worry too much about the Black church,\" he says. \"As long as there is racism within the White church, there will always be a Black church.\"\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

You can't. Here's why\n\nMore than two-fifths chose passing down financial assets to the next generation (44%); and having multiple streams of income (43%).\n\nMeanwhile, 35% selected \"retire early\" and 22% chose \"owning a business.\"\n\nIn terms of gender, Pew noted, \"Black women are more likely than Black men to say being debt-free, being able to pass down financial assets and being able to retire early are essential to their personal definition of financial success.\"\n\nAnd there are differences based on income. \"Black adults with lower levels of family income are more likely than those with middle or upper incomes to say being debt-free and owning a business are essential.\"\n\nSurvey respondents selected a number of factors that in their view make success possible. Top of the list was self-confidence (79%) and financial stability (75%).\n\n\"Far fewer see personal relationships having a significant role in success,\" Pew researchers said.\n\nA small majority (54%) said having supportive family members is necessary, while a smaller share said having connections (41%) or mentors (39%) was essential. Just 20% identified having a college degree.\n\nA majority of respondents (54%) said they worry on a nearly daily basis about one or more of several financial concerns: paying their bills (31%); the amount of debt they have (29%); being able to save enough for retirement (28%); being able to buy enough food (24%); being able to pay the rent or mortgage (23%); and the cost of health care (22%).\n\nAnd regardless of income, most Black adults said they feel financial pressures.\n\nFor instance, 64% of upper-income respondents and 70% of low-income ones said they felt pressures to provide for their families, while 50% of those with high incomes and 53% of those with low income said they feel pressure to own their own home.\n\nRelated article Strong economic growth but high unemployment: A look at Nevada's economy\n\nBut when it comes to emergency savings, there were notable differences between income groups. Overall, 28% of respondents said they could not cover expenses for three months if they lost their main income. But low earners (41%) were more than five times as likely as those with high incomes (7%) to say so. Less than a fifth of middle income earners (18%) said the same.\n\nA higher paycheck, of course, can make it much easier to set aside emergency savings. In an analysis of Black Americans' income in July, Pew noted that only 6% of Black adults in the US made $100,000 or more in 2021. But among those who said they would need $100,000 to live the life they want, 62% indicated they think they will reach that income level in the future.\n\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

      "text": "Black Americans are being hammered by a double pandemic\n\nIt started off as a strange-sounding disease that only other folks were getting.\n\nBut then it hit black people with a sudden ferocity. Many of the victims died alone, separated from family. Hospital workers were bewildered. The virus was unstoppable.\n\nThat's what Pernessa Seele saw when AIDS first devastated the black community in the late 1980s. She worked then as an immunologist at a Harlem hospital.\n\nShe's seeing a similar pattern now as the coronavirus ravages African American communities in Chicago, New York, Detroit, New Orleans and other places. For blacks, already more likely to die from HIV/AIDS than any other group in America, it's a double pandemic -  two lethal and incurable viruses hitting at once.\n\n\"This coronavirus is treacherous, and it is relentless,\" says Seele, founder and CEO of The Balm in Gilead, Inc.,  a nonprofit that works with faith communities to eliminate health disparities. \"It doesn't care if you have HIV. It'll fight with HIV for you  - two viruses for the control of your death.\"\n\nIt's too early to know how many Americans with HIV are dying of coronavirus. But the prospect of both incurable diseases racing through black neighborhoods is causing some black activists and health officials to shudder.\n\n\"It makes the specter of Covid-19 even more frightening,\" says Gregorio Millett, a vice-president and director of public policy for amfAR, Foundation for AIDS Research. \"It places just one more additional burden It could be devastating.\"\n\n\"When whites catch a cold, black folks get pneumonia.\"\n\nThat's a folk saying in the black community that reflects a historical pattern: Whenever a disease afflicts America, it hits black America even harder.\n\nBlack people are more likely than other Americans to have underlying health issues like diabetes, heart disease and lung disease. Blacks also are statistically more likely to live in poverty, with less access to health insurance. And more are mistrustful of health care providers.\n\nThis helps explain why blacks have been disproportionately victimized by HIV and AIDS. African Americans make up 13% of the US population but accounted for 42% of new HIV diagnoses in the United States in 2018, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .\n\nPeople are now living longer with HIV because of advances in treatment and medication, but many blacks can't afford those treatments or don't live in places where they are readily available, says Seele, from the Balm of Gilead.\n\n\"People are living longer with HIV, but if you don't have access to treatment you ain't living longer,\" she says.\n\nUnderlying health issues and limited access to treatment also partly explain why so many coronavirus victims are black. In Chicago, an estimated 72% of Covid-19 deaths have been among blacks, who make up just 30% of the city's population.\n\n\"We are at the top of the totem pole when it comes to disparities,\" says Bishop O.C. Allen III, an activist and founder of the Vision Church of Atlanta . Allen, who has hypertension, said he recently spent eight days in isolation in the hospital recovering from the coronavirus.\n\nThe prevalence of HIV infections also makes coronavirus an especially lethal disease in the black community. HIV breaks down its victims' immune system, and the coronavirus is particularly deadly for people with weakened immune systems.\n\nFor one, people with HIV are more likely to develop Type II diabetes, says Dr. Marjorie Innocent, senior director of health programs at the NAACP.\n\n\"The reality is that HIV can also increase the risk of developing other chronic conditions that increase the likelihood of complications from COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus,\" Innocent says.\n\nWhen asked if she could recall another time when the black community faced two deadly pandemics simultaneously, Innocent paused before answering.\n\n\"Two incurable viruses hitting the African-American population at the same time? I can't say that I do.\"\n\nSome community leaders are worried the coronavirus is already hampering the battle against HIV and AIDS.\n\n\"With this coronavirus, people might be afraid [to go to a hospital or clinic] to get an HIV test,\" says Allen, the activist.\n\nIf few black Americans are getting tested for HIV or the coronavirus, you could potentially have infected people unknowingly spreading both diseases through the community.\n\nSays Allen, \"It creates the perfect storm of disproportionate numbers.\"\n\nWhen compared to the HIV pandemic, there are some reasons for optimism about stopping the spread of the coronavirus in the black community.\n\nFor one, there was a stigma attached to victims of AIDS - especially back in the 1980s, in the early days of the virus - that does not exist with people diagnosed with the coronavirus.\n\nMany blacks are being exposed to Covid-19 because they hold service jobs, as grocery clerks or bus drivers or nurse's aides, and don't have the privilege of working from home. Americans today are praising the courage of these workers, not vilifying them as many once did with AIDS patients.\n\n\"President Trump has called this a war against the virus, and those are the people who are on the front lines,\" says Allen, the activist. \"We are the ones who are delivering goods, working the cash register. We're out there.\"\n\nIn addition, many of the public health officials now leading the nation's battle against Covid-19, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, are the same people who helped reduce the AIDS death toll, Millett says.\n\n\"That's the silver lining,\" Millett says. \"We've been successful in turning around one of the major epidemics of our lifetime, which is HIV. We've done this before.\"\n\nBut for such efforts to have a chance at success, experts say we will need more data on the coronavirus' impact on black patients.\n\nThis is why the NAACP and other groups are calling for more hospitals and public health officials to release a racial and ethnic breakdown of coronavirus victims, Innocent says. Up until now, that information has been spotty.\n\n\"It's very troubling that it's taken this long for data showing the disproportionate impact on African Americans to be released,\" Innocent says.\n\nSome also are concerned that even when health officials beat back the coronavirus, blacks will be the last to benefit because they won't have access to quick testing and advanced treatments.\n\n\"Even when we need these new innovations, the communities that need them the most won't get them,\" Millett says. \"You see this over and over again.\"\n\nUntil more black Americans rise out of poverty and get better medical care, they will continue to be at the mercy of pandemics like AIDS and Covid-19, black activists and health care leaders say.\n\nIf that happens, it'll be a grim replay of what Seele saw from the front lines of the AIDS epidemic - and something she now dreads.\n\n\"The death toll will continue to rise in the black community,\" she says. \"We'll be left out again.\"\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Young Black Americans who want to explore their roots can take a free birthright trip to Africa. Here's how\n\nThere are a lot of things that make up who we are as people. Our physical features, our pet peeves, our passions - and our roots. It's a puzzle we spend our entire lives trying to finish.\n\nAs human beings, we are complex and difficult to understand. But sometimes, looking back at where we came from and discovering the successes, struggles and sacrifices of our ancestors can make that puzzle a bit more complete.\n\nFor young black people, that discovery can mean the world.\n\nThat's why Birthright AFRICA , a nonprofit organization based in New York City, offers free trips to Africa for youth and young adults of African descent looking to explore their cultural roots. The organization also funds local and national exploration in cities like New York City and Washington, where scholars live and are a bus ride away from gaining an understanding of their history and contributions in the US before visiting the continent.\n\n\"National Black History Month often focuses on the past, but this is about creating an infrastructure so that we can help people transform their futures,\" Birthright AFRICA co-founder Diallo Shabazz told CNN.\n\n\"This isn't about validating black identity. It's about providing an opportunity for people to explore their ancestry. \"\n\nOne of Birthright AFRICA's most important goals is giving young scholars the knowledge that the American school system often fails to provide.\n\nThose who go on the trip visit cultural sites, museums, universities, and organizations managed and led by people of African descent to learn about the \"historic and present-day resilience and brilliance of their heritage often lacking in our school curriculums,\" according to Birthright AFRICA co-founder and CEO Walla Elsheikh.\n\nWhile it's been more than a half a century since the Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Education ruling found that \"separate but equal\" has no place in US public schools, true racial equality in our education system has yet to exist.\n\nSchools with more black students are less likely to provide counselors , offer advanced classes, and hire teachers with proper licenses. Consequently, black students are more likely to be absent from school and get suspended.\n\nAlthough black students in colleges have more access (and freedom) to choose their own courses, when it comes to study abroad programs, the lack of diversity and equal opportunities continues.\n\n\"Only 6% of study abroad students are black or of African descent. And only 2% of US managers, leaders, and entrepreneurs are of African descent,\" Elsheikh said.\n\n\"To address this gap in diversity and talent, Birthright AFRICA is creating the next generation of global leaders and entrepreneurs that are proud of their African heritage, confident in their innovative aspirations and connected to the African continent.\"\n\nWhile tourists visiting Africa are more likely to remember the food or safaris, those who have taken the birthright trip have something else to cherish.\n\nFor Shaina Louis, a 23-year-old Haitian student born and raised in New York, her birthright trip to Ghana in 2018 as a student at the City University of New York gave her one thing she'd never expected to find: closure.\n\n\"Prior to Birthright Africa, I had a lot of pent up resentment and antagonism due to a history that I felt my people had no say in. For those of us in the diaspora, our history, according to the textbooks, starts with slavery. I was doubtful and kind of cynical about what the future held not only for me as an individual, but also for black people as a whole,\" Louis told CNN.\n\nAfter years of wondering where she fit in in a world where her ancestors were \"stifled\" and doubting the connection between Africa and those whose were forced to leave, Louis finally got the answers to all of her unspoken questions.\n\n\"We may not speak the same language, but the foods we eat, the way we carry ourselves, the way we relate to one another, and our deeply ingrained spirituality reflect a bond that is still there,\" she said. \"There is a sense of inner peace and ease I now have, that wasn't there before. I can move forward with my life, with intention behind everything I do.\"\n\nKareem Williams, a 26-year-old scholar who went to Ghana on his birthright trip in 2019 as a participant of community-based GrowHouse NYC, said he felt extremely disconnected from his Jamaican roots while growing up in New York.\n\nWhat surprised Williams the most, he said, was the kindness he received from people in the country. Unlike the \"feeling of separation\" he's experienced in the US, for once, he felt like he belonged.\n\n\"Before I had even touched down in Ghana, the energy I felt as I got closer to Africa, I felt a rush, a vibration, and it was so strong,\" Williams said. \"It felt like something was pulling me towards the country. It felt surreal.\"\n\nVisiting Ghana, he said, made him feel that he had a place where he didn't have to \"constantly face resistance,\" an environment - and a system - that would help him thrive instead of hold him back.\n\n\"It has to do with the American system. There's so much prejudice and micro aggressions that I didn't feel in Ghana. I felt so connected to my ancestors for the first time. When I came back to the US, I realized how much it changed me. Like my life will never be the same.\"\n\nNow, Williams says he plans to someday return to Africa in hopes of getting into a position where he can become a global leader with the ability to influence reform, economic decisions, and infrastructure to collaboratively strengthen African businesses and communities.\n\nTo take a birthright trip to Africa, you have to be a US citizen and between 13 to 30 years old.\n\nYou also have to be of African descent; this includes African American, Afro-Caribbean, Afro-Europeans, Afro-Asian and Afro-Latinx, according to Elsheikh.\n\n\"We consider all black people of African descent,\" Elsheikh said. \"Our target groups are those who have been negatively impacted by the traumatizing enslavement and colonization of black people.\"\n\nBirthright AFRICA collaborates with high school, college, or community-based organization who are then considered \"partners.\" These educational partners select the participants and the country they will visit as part of the Birthright AFRICA program.\n\nAnyone who isn't already a part of one of these education partners can register through the Birthright AFRICA website which will then redirect them to a partner in their area with available spaces where they can apply.\n\nThose who take the trip to Africa get to go for free - flights, hotels, food, and costs of museums are covered by Birthright AFRICA and the educational partners.\n\nFor those who aren't interested in a trip but would like to help fund them, Birthright AFRICA heavily relies on donations to make these life-changing trips possible.\n\nCNN's Saeed Ahmed contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "California issued its first in-depth report detailing how the government has harmed Black Americans\n\nA panel in California considering reparations for Black Americans released its first report Wednesday detailing the \"innumerable\" harms of slavery in the state that \"have snowballed over generations.\"\n\nIn a 500-page interim report , the California Reparations Task Force detailed California's involvement in slavery and how it continues to negatively impact Black Americans. The nine-member panel is the first of its kind in any state. Advocates have been pushing lawmakers to replicate it at the federal level.\n\nChairperson Kamilah Moore said the report is the most extensive issued by the government on the African American community in more than 50 years.\n\n\"Thus, it is my hope that people in California and across the United States utilize this report as an educational and organizing tool, as this interim report exceeds expectations in substantiating the claim for reparations for the African American/American Freedmen community on the municipal, state and federal level,\" Moore said in a statement.\n\nThe document outlines how Black Americans have been harmed, including by slavery and political disenfranchisement, and in labor, housing, education, the criminal justice system, and arts and culture. The panel included preliminary recommendations for each category but said a final report will be issued next year.\n\n\"After the War of Independence, the American government continued to pass laws to maintain this false racial hierarchy which treated all Black people as less than human,\" the report states.\n\nThe task force calls for a state office to process reparations claims and \"identify and mitigate the ways that current and previous policies have damaged and destabilized Black families;\" to restore historical sites; to support education; and to offer free legal aid and other services.\n\nOther recommendations include updating language in the state's Constitution; removing racial bias and discriminatory practices in standardized testing; compensating people deprived of profits for their work; investing in and creating free healthcare programs; and  apologizing for acts of political disenfranchisement.\n\nIt is not yet clear how the state will put these recommendations into place.\n\nAn estimated 1,500 enslaved African Americans lived in the California in 1852, according to the report. The US Census Bureau says Black Americans make up almost 6.5% of the state's population.\n\nThe state established the panel in 2020 to study slavery as an institution and how it still affects Black Americans. In the past year, the task force has held hearings and discussed how the state should compensate those harmed by slavery, including descendants.\n\nThe task force said the interim report focuses on identifying and summarizing \"the myriad badges and incidents of slavery\" and the group's work is not finished.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Rob Bonta said the report is a historic step and commended the task force \"for being a model for partners across the nation.\"\n\n\"I urge every American to read the task force's report and join with us in recommitting ourselves to justice,\" Bonta said.\n\nCNN's Julia Vargas Jones contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Black communities are leading a vegan revolution. Food insecurity and systemic obstacles still stand in their way.\n\nWhen Brenda Sanders founded the Afro-Vegan Society in 2016, she felt her mission was promoting a choice between life or death. As a space for Black people to convene over their unique experience with veganism, it also revealed the dire health status of so many Americans.\n\n\"There's no way to even deny at this point that all of these completely preventable diseases that are still so prevalent in our community are not diet-related,\" Baltimore-native Sanders told Insider. \"It's a matter of life and death for marginalized communities, especially Black and Brown folks.\"\n\nSanders echoes a bleak statistic: on average, the life expectancy of Black Americans is 6 years lower than the overall population . With heart disease as the most common cause of death , poor diet and healthy food inaccessibility has had a detrimental impact for decades.\n\nDespite pressing health concerns, reports have shown that Black people are leading the numbers in vegan and plant-based eating. In the past 10 years, reports have shown that Black Americans were nearly three times more likely to follow a vegan diet. In 2021, a Gallup poll reported that 31% of nonwhite respondents cut back on their meat consumption within the year prior compared to 19% of white respondents. And a 2015 survey conducted by the Vegetarian Resource Group found that 8% of Black Americans reported never eating meat, fish, or poultry, compared to 3.4% of the overall population.\n\nAdvocates and Black vegans themselves are not surprised by these numbers. As a counter narrative to exclusive, coastal, and expensive options at retailers like Whole Foods or Erewhon, veganism and plant-based options have been ingrained in predominantly Black communities for much of the 20th century and beyond.\n\n\"When I was introduced to veganism and plant-based eating 25 years ago, it was through Black people who had opened up a health food store/cafe back in the early seventies,\" Sanders recalls. \"And if you go around the country, there were these little out of the way, tucked-into-the-corner-of-the-hood spots that were serving plant-based food.\"\n\nThe roots of Black veganism and vegetarianism go through many subcultures of Black America and the diaspora: from Rastafarianism, the Nation of Islam, and early hip-hop culture . Plant-based cuisine, existing for centuries before modern \"vegan\" nomenclature, have been reintroduced and reinvented within Black American culture for quite some time.\n\nWhile Black communities are no cultural stranger to plant-based or vegan options, accessibility is the primary obstacle to impacting community health. Post-pandemic, the nation is facing one of the highest rates of food insecurity in the past 25 years .\n\nAccording to the Harvard University Social Policy Data Lab , 1 in 6 Americans are struggling to eat meals daily with Black communities being twice as likely to experience food insecurity. On top of that, a history of geographic and urban planning has left large portions of the American South without easy access to food at all.\n\nDr. Amie Breeze Harper , author of \"Sistah Vegan: Black Women Vegans Speak on Food, Identity, Health and Society,\" purports that a laundry list of systemic tactics have led to the inaccessibility of healthy food options, including the \"racial wealth gap, poor transportation infrastructure\" and targeted marketing that excludes the majority of the nation.\n\n\"Systemic racism has made phenomena such as food apartheid a major impediment to achieving access to any type of holistic and culturally appropriate dietary practice, which includes veganism,\" Dr. Harper said. \"Food apartheid tends to affect Black and Brown communities the most, if we are talking about racialized minorities in the USA.\"\n\nA food desert, also as referred to as \"food apartheid,\" is defined by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) as \"large proportions of households with low incomes, inadequate access to transportation, and a limited number of food retailers providing fresh produce and healthy groceries for affordable prices.\" To qualify technically as a food desert, at least a third of the population must live more than 1 mile from a supermarket in an urban environment or 10 miles from a supermarket in rural areas. According to the McKinsey Institute for Black Economic Mobility, 21% of Black Americans reside in a food desert.\n\nBut the solution isn't as simple as erecting more supermarkets or groceries stores. Accessibility serves as the first behemoth for increasing nutritional value - reshaping demand and reducing costs follows directly behind as nutrient-rich food can cost ten times more than \"junk food, \" not including the increasing wealth gap or price inflation.\n\n\"Sometimes you build the supermarkets and people don't come,\" Sanders explained. \"And then it becomes 'well they had a grocery store there and people didn't support it so it shut down.' But how much did you reach out to the community? Did you do a cooking demo to the community? We got to get education there, too.\"\n\nTo bridge the knowledge gap, Black vegans are taking to social media to provide guides and recipes on how to prepare fresh foods once they're in the hands of those who need it. Collectively, vegan chefs and influencers alike have amassed millions of followers connected to vegan and plant-based cooking.\n\n\"I have seen how specifically Black communities, for example, are using the internet and social media to advocate for, and promote, their vegan food options and businesses in a way that didn't exist even 15 years ago,\" Dr. Harper said.  \"I think of how Tabitha Brown , Brenda Sanders , Tracye McQuirter , Kai Nortey , and Badass Vegan have used cyber technology to create a more diverse way to narrate and promote veganism.\"\n\nCelebrities have also advocated for veganism. In 2019, Beyoncé and Jay-Z offered fans the chance to win tickets to their concerts for life if they incorporated more plant-based meals into their diets. Venus Williams has spoken about how a raw plant-based diet helped her manage an autoimmune disease.\n\nThe deeply-rooted cultural significance of plant-based and vegan alternatives remains the key to the often overlooked popularity within Black communities. Dissecting it from continued trends and promoting its connection to issues related to individual well being, environmental health, and generational community development remains at the core of the Afro-Vegan Society's mission.\n\n\"We must divorce the idea of plant-based alternatives from trends, from the idea that it has to be expensive, or that it somehow runs counter to our culture,\" Afro-Vegan Society founder Sanders said. \"There are so many different problems that can start to be addressed by this one change.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "How Black History Month became a national celebration of Black Americans' accomplishments\n\nThe precursor to Black History Month was created in 1926, when the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History declared the second week of February as \"Negro History Week\" to recognize the contributions of Black Americans to US history.\n\nFrustrated by the lack of awareness of the Black community's accomplishments, historian Carter G. Woodson - known as the \"Father of Black History\" and the son of former slaves - along with other activists and civic leaders founded the Association. The organization, now known as the Association for the Study of African American Life and History, created research and publication outlets for Black scholars, including the Journal of Negro History and the Negro History Bulletin.\n\n\"If a race has no history, it has no worthwhile tradition, it becomes a negligible factor in the thought of the world, and it stands in danger of being exterminated,\" Woodson wrote in the Journal of Negro History in 1926.\n\nWoodson chose February to celebrate Negro History Week because it coincided with the birthdays of two men who represented freedom for Black Americans: Frederick Douglass, who spearheaded the movement for abolition in the country, and Abraham Lincoln, who issued the Emancipation Proclamation that declared the end of slavery.\n\nBlack communities had celebrated both Douglass and Lincoln for centuries since the late 19th century.\n\nIn the late 1960s, college students and educators, fueled by growing awareness of the Black past, pushed to expand Negro History Week into a month-long celebration. Schools and cultural and community centers across the country began adopting Black History Month.\n\nIn 1976, President Gerald Ford recognized Black History Month to \"honor the too-often neglected accomplishments of Black Americans in every area of endeavor throughout our history.\"\n\nOther countries have since joined in recognizing Black History Month, including Canada, Ireland, and the United Kingdom.\n\nWoodson believed it was important to provide a theme to focus the public's attention every year, emphasizing important developments throughout Black history.\n\nExamples of past themes included \"The Negro in Democracy\" in 1942, \"Black Women\" in 1996, and \"Black Health and Wellness\" in 2022.\n\nThe theme of this year's Black History Month is \"Black Resistance,\" which draws attention to how Black Americans have resisted oppression and discrimination for centuries. It also celebrates those who have fought for Black freedom, including Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and educator and civil rights activist Septima Clark.\n\nThe official colors of Black History Month are black, red, yellow, and green, which symbolize unity and pride. The colors are derived from the Ethiopian flag and the Pan-African flag, which was created in 1920 to represent the unity of the African diaspora and Black liberation in the US.\n\n\"Red is the color of the blood which men must shed for their redemption and liberty; black is the color of the noble and distinguished race to which we belong; green is the color of the luxuriant vegetation of our Motherland,\" according to the Universal Negro Improvement Association.\n\nThe color yellow, from the Ethiopian flag, symbolizes justice, optimism, and equality.\n\nJump to"

This weekend's event will include a trip to Providence Island, where former slaves settled before moving into what is now mainland Monrovia.\n\nWhile there are no official statistics tracking Black Americans moving abroad, many are discussing it more openly after the police killing of George Floyd. In the aftermath, many African Americans saw the U.S. \"from the outside in\" and made up their minds not to return.\n\nTashina Ferguson, a 26-year-old debate coach, was living in New York at the time of Eric Garner's death.\n\nShe moved to South Korea in 2019 and will celebrate Juneteenth on Sunday with a group of drag performers at a fundraising brunch for the Marsha P. Johnson Institute.\n\nShe has mixed feelings about the newest federal holiday.\n\n\"The commerciality of Juneteenth has become this like whole, 'Put it on a T-shirt, put it on ice cream tubs' type of thing,\" she said. \"But as a Black person within the Black community I'm like, 'Yeah, let's celebrate us.'\"\n\nShe said that only a powerful change would make her consider returning to the U.S.\n\nChrishan Wright in New Jersey regularly speaks with Black Americans who plan to or already have made the move abroad.\n\nWright, 47, hosts a podcast \"Blaxit Global\" and said many of her guests are tired of the U.S.\n\n\"They've done all the things to achieve what is supposed to be the American dream, and that yardstick keeps moving. They don't feel like they're on solid ground in terms of being able to retire comfortably or pay off student debt or just cover their bills.\"\n\nWright plans to move in 2023 to Portugal. Through her podcast, she already knows of Juneteenth celebrations this weekend in Lisbon, the capital.\n\nIn some places with larger populations of Black Americans, Juneteenth is already part of the program. LaTonya Whitaker, from Mississippi, has lived in Japan for 17 years. She is executive director of Legacy Foundation Japan, which hosted a Juneteenth gathering of about 300 people at the ritzy Tokyo American Club on Saturday.\n\nShe and her husband David didn't plan to live in Japan.\n\nLike Whitaker, many Black Americans at the Juneteenth event came to Japan almost by coincidence, as Christian missionaries or Peace Corps volunteers. But they made Japan their home. She now wants to raise their son there because she worries about gun violence in the U.S.\n\n\"I realized we really need a community,\" said Whitaker.\n\nMichael Williams teaches African American history at Temple University in Tokyo and left the U.S. when he was 22. He's now 66 and had lived abroad for much of his adult life, but returned to the U.S. for graduate school in Boston and Baltimore.\n\nAmerica has changed so much, he feels like a tourist when he visits, he laughed.\n\nWilliams said he knows about Juneteenth from teaching history.\n\n\"I would always end my presentations that hopefully, someday, this would be a national holiday. And so now it is, and it feels great,\" he said.\n\nIn Taipei, Toi Windham and Casey Abbott Payne are holding multiple events to celebrate Juneteenth. The two, part of Black Lives Matter Taiwan, are hosting performances by Black artists and musicians.\n\nBoth have celebrated with their families long before it was a federal holiday.\n\nWindham has lived in Taiwan for five years, and had always celebrated Juneteenth growing up in Texas. For her, it's an opportunity to educate people about a different part of American culture, even the darker parts.\n\n\"A lot of people tend to enjoy hip-hop culture and the attire and certain parts of our culture, but I feel like it's important to acknowledge all parts of Black culture,\" she said.\n\nPayne, an organizer, has lived in Taiwan for 11 years and said he also celebrated Juneteenth growing up in Milwaukee, which has one of the oldest celebrations nationwide.\n\n\"As a kid, I remember the street being lined with street vendors, and there's music going on and there'd be the Juneteenth parade rolling through,\" he said.\n\nStill for others, the day is a chance to joyfully kick back and rest.\n\nIn Bangkok, a group called Ebony Expats organized a silent movie screening, a bike ride in a nature reserve and a dinner for at a Jamaican restaurant serving jerk chicken and pumpkin soup.\n\nRestaurant owner Collin Clifford McKoy served 20 years in the U.S. Army before eventually opening his restaurant during the pandemic in Thailand. He said the Juneteenth holiday is a chance for Black people to share their culture while being so far from home, American or not.\n\n\"Overall, it's about coming together regardless of where we are, and it tells how much blood runs deep as a community to come together and enjoy ourselves,\" he said. ___ Associated Press writers Huizhong Wu in Taipei, Taiwan, Yuri Kageyama in Tokyo, Krista Larson in Dakar, Senegal and Jonathan Paye-Layleh in Monrovia, Liberia, contributed to this report.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "A large study found Black Americans are more likely to die from colorectal cancer because they are less likely to get life-saving treatments\n\nChadwick Boseman, the actor who starred in Marvel's Black Panther, died in late August at age 43 after a private 4-year battle with colon cancer .\n\nIt has long been known that there is a racial gap in colon cancer mortality rates in the US , with African Americans disproportionately diagnosed at later, hard-to-treat stages . (Chadwick Boseman was diagnosed with stage 3).\n\nNow, a new study on 16,382 patients with colon cancer offers some theories as to why Black Americans are particularly at-risk of dying from the disease, which is largely treatable at stages 1 and 2 .\n\nThe reasons, the researchers concluded, all stemmed from a systemic lack of access to care.\n\nThe researchers from City of Hope National Medical Center in California looked at data from 2000 to 2012 on California patients with colon cancer that spread to their liver, comparing treatments, outcomes, and demographics such as race, age, sex, and concurrent health issues.\n\nThey found Black people are 10% less likely overall to have life-saving treatment for colorectal cancer. They're also 17% more likely to die than white peers.\n\nWhen Black patients underwent liver surgery to treat the cancer's spread to that organ, they had the same survival rate as white patients.\n\nBut the study, published today in JAMA Network Open, found Black patients were least likely to undergo surgery or chemotherapy.\n\nDr. Lucas Thornblade, City of Hope surgical oncology fellow and first author of the study, said the disparity \"could be attributed to factors such as lower rate of referral to cancer specialists, late detection of colorectal cancer metastases and patient-reported barriers, including fear of cancer and its treatment, costs, and the burdens of transportation and childcare during therapy.\"\n\nResearchers believe that, in part, explains why Black Americans had the lowest median survival length of any group - 11 months, compared to the longest-living group, Middle Eastern patients at 18 months.\n\n\"The unfortunate reality is that minorities, especially Black people, have a much lower chance of getting lifesaving cancer treatment. Health care works within a social construct, and to change health disparities, we need social change,\" Dr. Mustafa Raoof, surgical oncologist at City of Hope and co-author of the study, said in a press release.\n\nHealthcare inequality and medical racism are well-documented in America.\n\nFor instance, in the current coronavirus pandemic, a large body of evidence has found Black Americans are among the most susceptible to COVID-19 .\n\nThat's not simply genetics or biology, but the result of complex intersections of discrimination and inequality in employment, housing, stress, and other chronic illnesses as well as reliable access to both preventative care and medical treatment, experts say.\n\n\"Opportunity and exposure are not equally distributed, especially by race, in this country,\" Dr. Camara Jones, an epidemiologist and physician with affiliations at Morehouse, Emory, and Harvard universities, previously told Business Insider .\n\nThe body-shaming Chadwick Boseman experienced is a reminder to think twice before commenting on a celebrity's weight loss\n\nWhat you need to know about colon-cancer symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment\n\nChadwick Boseman worked through colon cancer. 3 other people with the illness talked to Insider about what that's really like.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "I moved from the US to the safest city in Mexico. Here are 9 things that surprised me about the process.\n\nOn April 16, I made my choice to leave the United States because I felt unsafe as a Black person in the US.\n\nThis decision came after months of burnout, exhaustion, near-daily panic attacks, and fear. I watched the news - racial injustice, violence, the insurrection at the Capitol - and just felt more grief and rage, which is nothing new.\n\nEventually, my health took turns for the worse from the levels of stress and anxiety I was under daily. My Google search history became overwhelmed with \"safest cities for Black Americans\" and \"top cities for expats.\"\n\nSo my partner and I took the leap and relocated to the second safest city in North America and safest city in Latin America - Mérida, Mexico. Here are some things that surprised me about the process:\n\nBecoming an expat can seem scary, but with proper planning and research it wasn't actually that difficult.\n\nFor starters, I knew I wanted to move somewhere safe, warm, and affordable with access to high-speed Internet so I could run my expatriate consulting business.\n\nI wanted peace and freedom with the ability to go out and have some fun, too. So I turned to Mexico.\n\nBloomberg's 2021 Best Places to Live for Expats also ranked Mexico as one of the top three countries to live in due to the cost of living, quality of life, and ease of transition.\n\nIt's also important to consider the quality of medical care, the current political climate , and visa requirements while you search.\n\nThe next biggest step was choosing our \"out date,\" when we'd finally move .\n\nSeeing vlogs and videos from locals allowed us to see the perspective of people who are already in our potential destination. They also helped show us what the day-to-day looks like from a non-tourist perspective.\n\nWe also searched for videos like \"apartment hunting in Mexico\" to get an idea of what life as an expat entails and what we should look out for along the way.\n\nMexico has very relaxed visa laws, which made it easier for us to make our exit . That said, some countries have hefty costs associated with their visas that can make the process both lengthy and expensive.\n\nYou can also visit Mexico from the US without a visa, which is a good option if you want to get a taste of the country without committing entirely.\n\nIf you're decided on living in Mexico for the long haul you can apply for a temporary-residency visa while in the US. This requires a little more work to get, but it allows you to stay in the country for up to four years.\n\nEven though I made a quick decision to move, I was able to do so after months of becoming more intentional about my budget and how I utilized my extra income.\n\nA common rule of thumb is to save at least enough to cover one year's worth of expenses in your destination country. What surprised us the most about this process is how quickly we met our savings goal by downsizing our current lifestyle.\n\nOnce we determined our out date, we began downsizing and filling our garage with things that were no longer a priority.\n\nWe separated the space into two halves - things to keep and things to sell. This was initially a daunting task, but Facebook Marketplace was the greatest tool in rehoming some of our favorite items.\n\nWe were also able to create additional income, which sped up our exit plan.\n\nIn a matter of weeks, we added nearly $5,000 to our Mexico savings account. As the excitement began to take over, it became easier to get rid of more items.\n\nIn order to avoid exorbitant rental-car charges, we sold our vehicles two days before our departure date. We tried a few dealerships, but Carmax gave us the best offers and we were able to add another cushion of cash to our savings .\n\nWe also bought a cheap storage unit to keep our personal items, like family photos, in until we find our forever home.\n\nSince we utilized the cost-free tourist visa, the most expensive part of moving was our oversized luggage, which cost us an extra $300.\n\nBut learn from our mistakes - most of the things we brought probably could've been repurchased at a significantly lower cost once we arrived at our destination.\n\nIt can be extremely helpful to prioritize the things you can't live without instead of little luxuries you may use down the road.\n\nMany debit cards charge a foreign-transaction fee so we opened an account with Charles Schwab because they don't.\n\nWe also had to make sure our phones were unlocked and able to be fully functional in Mexico. We often use our cell phones for translations, directions, and to share our experiences on social media so it was important that we'd be able to use them at any time.\n\nIn many cities, it's wise not to search for your home until after you've arrived so that you can explore the different neighborhoods and determine which area will best meet your needs . The market can also be fast-paced, so the places you find online might not be available by the time you arrive.\n\nWe reserved an Airbnb prior to our arrival which allowed us to find local realtors who could show us what options were available.\n\nIt can also be helpful to rent an Airbnb you potentially see yourself living in. Sometimes hosts offer long-term leases that can be negotiated for a lower cost than what's presented online.\n\nBy not immediately jumping into a lease, you can determine if you can see yourself in the city for the long-term.\n\nWe've taken this opportunity to truly explore the country and decide for ourselves what we want our life to look like .\n\nMérida is beautiful and we thought we'd stay there for a while, but we realized we wanted the feel of a larger, metropolitan city instead. Now, we're headed for Mexico City.\n\nThe most important lesson of our journey so far is knowing it's OK to change your mind.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "9 startling facts that show just how hard the student-debt crisis is hurting Black Americans\n\nIn the wake of George Floyd's death, the Black Lives Matter protests have shined a spotlight on America's long history of inequality and systemic racism .\n\nEducation is one area where Black Americans are hurting the most as the result of institutionalized racism - especially with student loans.\n\nBlack students are not only more likely to need to take on debt for school , graduates are also nearly five times as likely to default on their loans than their white peers.\n\nThe racial gap between Black and white student borrowers prompted senators who ran for a presidential bid in 2019 to address the issue during their campaigns: Elizabeth Warren's initiative would have wiped all student debt for 75% of US borrowers , and Bernie Sanders called to eliminate all such debt .\n\nHere are nine mind-blowing statistics about the student-debt crisis' impact on black borrowers as compared to white students. (The majority of data sources compared Black- and white-borrower debt, which is why other racial groups were not mentioned directly.)\n\nOf the black students who graduated in 2003, one in two defaulted on their student loans sometime within the following 12 years, according to data from the National Center for Education Statistics as analyzed by Student Loan Hero .\n\nIn comparison, the rates of default for white student was at 21.5%, and 36.1% for Latino students.\n\nBeth Akers, fellow at the Brookings Institution's Center on Children and Families, told Martha C. White of NBC News that black students don't benefit as much from their parents' wealth as white students do.\n\nWell-off black families have a lower average net worth than white families, and they hold their wealth differently - mostly in homeownership as opposed to financial assets like stocks that are easy to access, White reported.\n\nBlack students with bachelor's degrees owe $7,400 more student debt on average upon graduation than white grads, according to Brookings .\n\nThe gap widens over time: after four years, black grads hold almost twice as much in student debt as their white counterparts at $53,000.\n\nBrookings analyzed restricted-use data from the Department of Education's Baccalaureate and Beyond surveys, as well as Department of Education and Census Bureau data.\n\nThough just six out of every 100 BA holders default on their loans, black borrowers are much more likely to default: 21% of them default on their loans compared to just 4% of white grads, according to Brookings . Furthermore, black graduates with a bachelor's degree are even slightly more likely to default - or don't make a payment for 270 consecutive days - than white college dropouts.\n\nBrookings does not attribute the racial disparity to just lower levels of parent education or family income. Instead, they point to higher for-profit graduate-school enrollment and lower earnings post-grad.\n\nA Wall Street Journal analysis of Education Department data found that not only do alumni at HBCUs take on 32% more debt than graduates at other public or nonprofit four-year schools, the majority of graduates haven't paid any debt in the first few years out of school.\n\nWhile HBCUs make up just 5% of four-year American colleges, they make up \"50% of the 100 schools with the lowest three-year student-loan repayment rates,\" the Journal found. The discrepancy could be because black families already have less wealth compared to other racial groups.\n\nHBCUs are typically more affordable than other institutions, according to Student Loan Hero . Spelman College, the most expensive HBCU as of January 2019, costs $28,181 in tuition, several thousand dollars less than the national average of $32,410 for private four-year colleges.\n\nThe Roosevelt Institute , a liberal think tank based in New York, found that white households headed by people between the ages of 25 and 40 have 12 times the amount of wealth on average than black households.\n\nBy eliminating student debt - as presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have proposed to do in some capacity - the ratio shrinks to just five times the amount of wealth .\n\nEven after canceling debt, however, the racial wealth gap will remain high: the median wealth in young white households would total $52,700, compared to $10,010 for their black peers.\n\nThat's according to a study by Jason Houle and Fenaba Addo in SAGE journals . They found that racial inequalities in student debt contribute to the black-white wealth gap in early adulthood, which increases over time.\n\nAfter adjusting for family background and postsecondary characteristics, black youth reported 85.8% more debt than their white peers when starting their careers, according to the authors. This disparity grows by 6.7% annually, they said.\n\nBlack college graduates ages 21 to 24 earn $3.34 less per hour than their white peers, reported Jillian Berman for MarketWatch , citing an analysis by the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. That contributes to a $7,000 annual difference.\n\nThe data found the workers held similar qualifications and experience levels.\n\nThe Center for American Progress , a liberal think tank, released a report in January that found black students are more likely to borrow more money to attend graduate school than their white peers. As a result, the median debt for black graduate students is 50% higher than for their white peers.\n\nBlack graduate students' federal loans are, on average, $25,000 higher than white graduate school grads, the report found.\n\n\"The current system has had particularly pernicious effects on Black and Latinx students, as well as women, who are seeking a better life for themselves and their families,\" Ben Miller, vice president for postsecondary education at the Center for American Progress, wrote in the report. \"It is time for the federal government to make sure that the tens of billions of dollars in graduate student loans it provides each year really are making lives better.\"\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Slave codes used to dictate what enslaved people could or couldn't wear. Newly freed Black Americans shed their old clothes as a symbol of freedom.\n\nFor centuries, Juneteenth has been a celebration of emancipation, community, and joy for Black Americans.\n\nThe holiday originated in Galveston, Texas on June 19, 1865, when a Union Army general declared that more than 250,000 enslaved Black people were freed. The first celebrations for Juneteenth - a portmanteau of \"June\" and \"nineteenth\" - took place one year later in 1866 in Texas.\n\nNow, the holiday is celebrated in a variety of ways across the nation, ranging from parades and pageants to concerts and cookouts .\n\nAnother visually and historically significant way Juneteenth is celebrated is through fashion, which became a way for descendants of enslaved Black Americans to reclaim a collective past, and to express their social and political freedom.\n\nFrom the 16th to 19th centuries, slave codes in certain states made slavery a permanent condition and defined slaves as property, employing similar language to those describing real estate. These codes also dictated what enslaved people could and couldn't wear.\n\nUnder the code in some states, like Virginia and South Carolina, slave owners were legally required to provide clothing for enslaved workers. The clothing they did provide, however, was often uncomfortable, emphasizing durability over comfort or style.\n\nSome slave owners gave their workers fabric instead of clothes, expecting them to cut and sew their own clothing, according to curator Madelyn Shaw. These fabrics included flannel, osnaburg linen, and plains, a stout and heavy woolen cloth that was often hot and scratchy to wear.\n\nLike skin color, clothing was a visible mark of social status, used by the controlling white society to discriminate and separate. The Negro Law of South Carolina explicitly prevented slaves from \"wearing finer, or of greater value than negro cloth.\"\n\n\"I have a vivid recollection of the linsey-woolsey dress given me every winter by Mrs. Flint. How I hated it! It was one of the badges of slavery,\" Harriet Ann Jacobs, an abolitionist activist and writer who escaped slavery, wrote in her memoir.\n\nJust as clothing was used as a means of control and separation, freed slaves reclaimed fashion as a symbol of freedom.\n\nIn 1861, during the American Civil War, newly emancipated slaves spent hours waiting in line to pick clothing of their choice from boxes of old and new clothing that were distributed from Northern states, according to Laura Towne, an abolitionist at the time.\n\nThe clothes that were given away were often soiled and old, but the newly freed Americans \"were eager to discard the osnaburg and linsey that had been the badge of slavery, giving whatever they had to remove that physical mark of their former status,\" Shaw, the curator, wrote.\n\nDuring the first official Juneteenth celebrations in Texas in 1866, Black Americans ceremoniously cast off their ragged clothes and threw them into the river. They instead donned clothes taken from the plantations that had belonged to their former \"masters\" as a symbol of their newfound freedom.\n\nTo this day, self-expression through fashion remains an important part of Juneteenth celebrations.\n\nSome Black Americans celebrate the holiday and honor their ancestors by wearing traditional clothing from the African diaspora.\n\nOthers follow a color theme: Red, white, and blue - the tri-colors of the Juneteenth flag - serve as reminders that enslaved Black Americans were first and foremost American. Another symbolic color trio is red, black and green, which are also the official colors of Black History Month .\n\n\"Red is the color of the blood which men must shed for their redemption and liberty; black is the color of the noble and distinguished race to which we belong; green is the color of the luxuriant vegetation of our Motherland,\" according to the Universal Negro Improvement Association.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "How the Black aristocracy of the Gilded Age ushered in a new era of education and freedom\n\nIn a letter published in the April 22, 1852 issue of the Frederick Douglass Papers, someone known only by the pen name \"Ethiop\" observed: \"Quite a combination of enterprising Blacks are beginning to appear.\"\n\n\"They begin to take their places in every pursuit about town and country; and as their thoughts and sympathies partake of their varied and independent occupations, they naturally form an active and efficient business class. I call it an ARISTOCRACY,\" Ethiop declared.\n\nThe observation signaled the emergence of a new Black elite in New York City, which bloomed in full force during the Gilded Age - a period toward the end of the 19th century marked by rapid economic growth and prosperity.\n\nThe HBO show \"The Gilded Age,\" which recently premiered its second season , captures the clash between Manhattan's old and new money. It also gives viewers a glimpse into the world of wealthy Black Americans previously overlooked in history.\n\n\"The Black elite of the Gilded Age signaled that we too have taste. We too have education. We are like other citizens,\" Carla Peterson, historian and author of \"Black Gotham: A Family History of African Americans in Nineteenth-Century New York City,\" told Insider.\n\nJust a few years after the Emancipation Proclamation was signed in 1863, the Gilded Age ushered in a Black aristocracy, made up of Black Americans who managed to amass wealth they'd previously been barred from.\n\nIndustrialization and the railroad boom opened up business opportunities across the US. Many of the Black elite were made up of the \"shopkeeping aristocracy\" who owned retail and grocery stores and pharmacies, according to Peterson.\n\n\"After the Civil War, there was an incredible explosion of modern industry, technology, and science, which fueled the money that makes the Gilded Age,\" Peterson said. \"Black families of wealth emerged in this context.\"\n\nThomas Downing, the son of formerly enslaved parents, moved to New York City and became a savvy businessman who popularized oysters, which had once been considered common food . In 1825, he opened the upscale Thomas Downing Oyster House - a restaurant so popular that Downing was nicknamed \"the \"New York Oyster King.\"\n\nDowning was one of the wealthiest people in New York City at the time of his death in 1866, even though he was prohibited from acquiring US citizenship until the Civil Rights Act of 1866 was passed, just one day before he died.\n\nThere was also Pierre Toussaint, who was born a slave in Haiti and was eventually freed in New York City. He became a highly sought-after hairdresser among the society's upper crust, and used his new wealth to support orphans and immigrants gain education and employment.\n\nBlack women also gained financial and social power. Mary Ellen Pleasant became a self-made millionaire after she moved to San Francisco, following the glimmer of the California Gold Rush . While she worked as domestic help, she listened to the wealthy men she served as they exchanged information on making proper investments and managing money.\n\nPleasant used that knowledge to buy up boarding houses, laundromats, restaurants, and Wells Fargo shares, becoming a famous figure in San Francisco.\n\nMoney alone didn't grant access to the upper echelons of Black society. In addition to having \"character\" and \"respectability,\" the Black elite emphasized both education and hard work as core values, according to Peterson.\n\n\"Since Blacks came to this country, education has always been number one,\" Peterson told Insider. \"There is a belief that if you had ambition, you could do anything you wanted. And ambition started with education.\"\n\nOn February 25, 1837, Quaker philanthropist Richard Humphreys founded the first HBCU in the country, the African Institute - now Cheyney University - in Pennsylvania. The majority of HBCUs originated from 1865 to 1900, the period following the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nEducation was key to unlocking the skills to become a doctor or pharmacist, and also led to a flourishing of interests in humanities and the arts, according to Peterson. Scholars like W.E.B. Du Bois advocated for the need for an educated class.\n\n\"The Negro race, like all races, is going to be saved by its exceptional men,\" Du Bois wrote in his essay, 'Talented Tenth.\"\n\nNot everyone lived lavish lifestyles. The Gilded Age was also notorious for having the most significant wealth inequality in American history. The vast majority of workers, especially Black Americans and immigrants, faced extreme poverty and harsh working conditions in factories.\n\n\"Chattel slavery is dead, but industrial slavery remains,\" economist and New York mayoral candidate Henry George said in 1886.\n\nEven those who did manage to gain wealth faced pervasive systemic inequities. White society largely viewed Black Americans as \"a homogenous mass of degraded people,\" according to historian Willard B. Gatewood in his book, \"Aristocrats of Color: The Black Elite.\"\n\n\"Even exceptional Blacks were considered inferior to whites,\" Gatewood wrote.\n\nBut there was also a \"certain amount of cooperation and interracial alliances between Blacks and whites,\" Peterson told Insider, describing how professional relationships enabled Black Americans to climb the ranks within businesses. She also pointed to the King's Daughters, a nationwide charity organization where white and Black women worked together to help those in need.\n\nPeterson said the emergence of the Black elite is inextricably tied to the burgeoning political and social activism in the 20th century, as exemplified by the 1909 founding of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the political magazine The Crisis, and the Harlem Renaissance.\n\n\"None of this could have happened without having had the 19th century Black elite,\" Peterson said.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "For some children of immigrants, 'African American' doesn't fit their unique, Black experiences in the US\n\nAlex Love is a born and raised New Yorker. She's lived in that city for the past 34 years she's been on this earth. But unlike many Americans, she doesn't like McDonald's, favors a chicken patty over takeout, and says \"good morning\" to strangers she passes on the street.\n\n\"I grew up knowing that I was American, but not a 'regular American,'\" the consultant told Insider.\n\nBoth Love's parents are from Barbados. So how she shows up in American society and views her Blackness was first shaped by that Black immigrant experience.\n\n\"If you have a parent born in another country, even though you're born here, your upbringing is still predominantly led and shaped by where your parents came from and their own culture,\" said Haitian-American journalist, Edvige Jean-François who speaks extensively on the Black immigrant experience.\n\nStraddling the line of an African American and Black immigrant identity can even make it difficult to feel connected to historical milestones and celebrations unique to the US, including recent Juneteenth commemorations.\n\n\"I think that it's great that people are celebrating, but I don't feel connected to it,\" she said. \"For me, I can trace my history within Barbados so that's where I feel rooted.\"\n\nBlack, second-generation immigrants spoke with Insider about that intersectionality, and how they internalize American Blackness through a different lens than their African American counterparts whose existence dates back to US slavery.\n\nSecond-generation immigrants - people born in the US with at least one immigrant parent - make up 12% of the American population, according to a 2017 Pew report.\n\nBut the term can also be applied to those born abroad and raised in the US.\n\nBlack immigrants with parents from the Caribbean, Northern and sub-Saharan Africa , and a smaller group from Canada and Europe are included in that makeup.\n\n\"Unfortunately, people do look at [all] Black people here as being black when it comes to these things and don't recognize our individual cultures and ethnicities,\" Jean-François said.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has had her own Blackness called into question on account of her Jamaican heritage. And former President Barack Obama faced lingering attacks on a racial identity, and US citizenship from the far-right who pinpoint his Kenyan father.\n\nWith parents or guardians from countries where Black people are usually the dominant majority race, some second-generation immigrants like Love hold a different view of their place in the US in comparison to African Americans with longstanding history here.\n\nSociology professor Nancy Foner noted pressure to reject the dominant culture \"is usually found in first-generation immigrants,\" but with second-generation immigrants often \"a small minority\" still favor their ancestral home and cultural practices.\n\nFor those that do, their reasons can be as rooted in societal anti-Blackness in the US that positions African Americans as inferior, as it is cultural pride. As a result, some second-generation Americans, even those who migrated to the US as a child attempt to distance themselves from African Americans .\n\n\"My upbringing is very heavy on manners. I kind of had a different standard,\" Love said. \"So I kind of grew up believing that Americans didn't have as good manners as Caribbean kids.\"\n\nOne of the things that she found most challenging was navigating between being identified as Caribbean and being identified as African American, especially being born and raised in the US.\n\nFoner said there is often a struggle second-generation Black immigrants face to define their Blackness, often most closely associating with their parents' homelands.\n\n\"They think of themselves in many cases as African Americans, but they also think of themselves in many cases as Jamaicans or Nigerians,\" she told Insider. \"And because of how other Americans view race, they have a problem establishing their ethnic identity.\"\n\nSome research suggests most children of immigrants eventually assimilate , taking on the cultural norms of where they reside to better fit in with the world outside of their homes.\n\nBut that's not always the case - especially for Black second-generation Americans whose parents themselves may be unaware of the societal nuances that dictates what it means to be Black in America.\n\nThose who lean heavily towards becoming more Americanized may do so with the intent of being part of the African American culture.\n\nJean-François told Insider she was keen to learn about Blackness in America and determined to understand the African American experience beyond what she learned in her Haitian home.\n\nHer parents, who migrated to the US in their 30s and 40s, didn't necessarily understand the systemic racism, redlining, economic disenfranchisement, or just being treated differently primarily because of the color of their skin.\n\nTheir idea of navigating American society and becoming successful hitched on the cornerstone of attaining proper education and avoiding political or social activism and groups - something they didn't associate with their African American counterparts.\n\nJean-François' own experience proved that to be untrue having moved to Canada, then the US. She was first made aware of her racial difference when, at eight years old, a white girl asked Jean-François whether her parents had left her in the toaster for too long.\n\nLove, too, came to the realization that what she learned in the home sometimes did not translate to when she was out in the world as a Black person, especially in the corporate world.\n\nAt home, she was taught to be humble, keep her head down, and that with a good education and hard work she would be successful.  But \"that has not been true, in my experience, in the [American] workforce,\" she said.\n\nThere are times, she said, when she had to be bold and make herself seen in a way she was told African Americans behaved to get ahead.\n\nBut as part of the African diaspora overall, Love told Insider African Americans and Black immigrants are connected through shared traumas of slavery and segregation.\n\nBlack immigrants are part of the larger Black community in America and have similarly been treated institutional racism. As recent as 2018 the killings of St. Lucian American Botham Shem Jean and Jamaican American Saheed Vassell made national and international news as two Black immigrants who were victims of police brutality.\n\nDifferences like Jamaican, Ghanaian, or Panamanian may be important at home - not within American institutions that devalue Black skin regardless of whether it carries a blue or red passport.\n\n\"Being Black in America, the rest of the world doesn't care what my name is,\" Ephiphane Yohou, a Maryland-based global marketing strategist said, adding non-Black people seldom say 'let me go and find out where her last name comes from.'\"\n\n\"If you're Black, you're Black,\" she told Insider.\n\nYohou, whose parents migrated from the Ivory Coast in West Africa, is often subject to the same stereotypes as all Black Americans - including the over-policing of her dress, hair, and mannerism in the workplace.\n\nShe says the complexity of being Black in America, with various ethnic backgrounds, is all rooted in the desire to be accepted and free in the US - regardless of if a Black person is born in America or makes a home here for themselves.\n\nThe diaspora has been uniting to fight against racial injustice, including marches in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. Second generation Americans' lived experience also uniquely position them to fight against anti-Black racism while amplifying imm migrant issues.\n\nBlack immigrants are detained and deported at disproportionate rates relative to their population , and many young migrants from Africa and the Caribbean are DACA recipients.\n\n\"We have to recognize African American cultures in the fight that they have waged historically, for African Americans, but all Black people who come here have benefited and are benefiting from it,\" Jean-François said.\n\nEven though their upbringing resulted in two different views of where they stand on being Black in America, both Love and Jean-François agree on one thing: being a Black person in America means dealing with racism.\n\nWith that experience nearly universal across the diaspora, Jean-François says country-of-origin debates detract from liberation for all Black people, no matter where they're born.\n\n\"Whether or not we celebrate our individual cultures, when it comes to America and how they view Black people, we face the same challenges,\" she said.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Majority of Black Americans believe U.S. institutions are conspiring against them, poll finds\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nWASHINGTON - Most Black Americans say they've experienced racial discrimination regularly or from time to time, which colors how they view U.S. institutions like policing, the political system and the media, according to a study on conspiracy theories.\n\nThe study released Monday by the Pew Research Center examined the intersection of race and conspiratorial beliefs. It's the second installment in the research group's series on how Black Americans see success and failure .\n\nThe study defines racial conspiracy theories as ideas that Black Americans might have about \"the actions of U.S. institutions\" that aren't necessarily the stated goals of the institution. The study stresses that these are claims that Black Americans may have because of America's documented history of racist policies largely impacting Black communities. Pew examined claims including conspiratorial beliefs about how major institutions discriminate against Black Americans and support for generational adages such as \"you have to work twice as hard\" to advance compared with white Americans.\n\nFor instance, the study found that more than 8 in 10 Black Americans surveyed agreed with the statement that \"Black people are more likely to be incarcerated because prisons want to make money on the backs of Black people.\" And more than 6 in 10 Black adults surveyed agreed that institutions such as the criminal justice system, the country's economic system and policing are designed to hold Black people back.\n\nThose sentiments exist alongside a reality that Black people were 32% of sentenced state and federal prisoners in 2022 , even though they make up just 12% of the overall U.S. population. By comparison, white people were underrepresented among prisoners at 31%, while Hispanic people were slightly overrepresented at 23% of prisoners, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics.\n\nPew's study draws from a poll of Black Americans conducted last September. Study authors say that views are unlikely to have shifted since the respondents were surveyed.\n\nThe study also explored why Black adults believe these narratives and allowed respondents to explain how they feel about discrimination and racial disparities in their own words, said senior Pew researcher and study author Kiana Cox.\n\nShe added that although the survey was released during an election year it does not focus on partisan politics. Rather, it showcases the feelings Black Americans have that can influence how the community views the nation but often go unheard or aren't taken seriously.\n\n\"There are anecdotal conversations among Black people about the system, the Man, the invisible hand, the agenda that is set out to create a situation where Black people can't advance. So, we wanted to explore that,\" Cox said. \"We also wanted to figure out how many Black people are familiar with these narratives about the system being designed for their failure and how many Black people believe them.\"\n\nAmericans are far from impervious to conspiratorial thinking dating back to the founding of the nation , a legacy that has gained new life as the internet supercharged communication and, often, the spread of misinformation and hoaxes . The Pew study notes that Black Americans have a unique relationship with both discrimination and claims of government conspiracy theories given the nation's legacy of slavery, Jim Crow era segregation laws and modern day discrimination against Black Americans by public and private actors.\n\n\"When you have a history of American institutions actually conspiring against Black people, it's not so hard to believe that anything else would also be true,\" said Tasha Philpot, a professor of political science at the University of Texas at Austin, who studies political psychology among Black Americans.\n\n\"Especially in the last few years where race has been pretty salient, it doesn't surprise me that people would say they are experiencing racial discrimination,\" she said.\n\nAmong Black adults who have experienced discrimination, about three-quarters said it made them feel as though the system as a whole was designed to keep them down. Black adults who have faced discrimination also felt varying emotions as a result - 76% felt angry overall, 53% said they worried about their personal safety, and 41% felt depressed, for example. Researchers surveyed 4,736 Black, multiracial Black and non-Hispanic, and Black and Hispanic respondents last September from across the country.\n\nBlack Americans were also likely to believe racial conspiracy theories about politics. Three-quarters of those surveyed said they agreed that \"Black public officials being singled out to be discredited more than white officials\" happens in politics today. In medicine, the survey found that 55% of those surveyed said they agreed with the statement that \"medical researchers experiment on Black people without their knowledge or consent.\"\n\nPhilpot said some Black Americans may still believe such theories, given documented episodes of discrimination such as the Tuskegee syphilis experiment and the exclusion of Black Americans from New Deal programs that benefited white Americans.\n\n\"It's not really a conspiracy theory if it's true,\" she said.\n\nFor more from NBC BLK, sign up for our weekly newsletter .\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

About three-quarters of Black people said so despite where they come from, their economic status or educational backgrounds.\n\nOverall, 14 percent say being Black is only somewhat important to their identity and 9 percent say it has little to no impact, highlighting the diversity of thought among Black Americans, which include U.S.-born Black people and Black immigrants, and different ethnicities, political party affiliations and ages.\n\nPew Research Center released its report on Black identity on Thursday, and the results pinpoint the critical role race plays in shaping identity in the U.S.\n\n\"What our data suggests to me is that being Black is important to all Black people, according to our findings, regardless of the intersections of their identity,\" said Kiana Cox, research associate and co-author of the report. A \"majority of Black people, 76 percent, said that being Black was really important to them.\"\n\nCox, who has worked with Pew Research Center in Washington, D.C., for about four years, said they wanted to make sure they had a large enough sample to \"get this kind of nuance within racial and ethnic groups, but also to understand sort of life and society as Black people understand it.\"\n\nShelly Eversley, a professor at The City University of New York, said the 76 percent of survey respondents who consider their Blackness important to their identity was still less than she would expect it to be because \"race informs every asset of Black life.\"\n\n\"Understanding the way race informs daily life is protection for a lot of Black people,\" said Eversley, who has taught about race for 20 years and is interim chair for the Department of Black and Latinx Studies. She was not a participant in the report.\n\nShe said being Black is something you are aware of at a young age. Black children are often disciplined harder at school and other places, and their parents tend to have conversations with them about the dangers of racism when they are still young, she added.\n\nThe report also points to how the importance that people place on being Black fosters a sense of connectedness among communities, Cox said.\n\nPeople who say that being Black is an important part of their personal identity were more likely to express a sense of connection with Black people in their local communities, in the U.S. and around the world than those who said Blackness is relatively less important.\n\nThere are 47 million Black people in the U.S., about 14 percent of the population, according to the 2020 census. Most Black adults in the U.S. where born in the country, but an increasing portion of the population is comprised of immigrants, about 12 percent. Of the Black immigrant population, 90 percent were born in the Caribbean or Africa.\n\nCox also said she was shocked to learn that place - or where people grew up and were living - played a large role in identity and how people shaped their values and what they viewed as important issues.\n\nBlack Americans cited violence and crime, along with economic issues such as poverty and homelessness as the most important issues to address in their communities, according to the report. The most important local issues named across subgroups of Black Americans does vary but often violence and crime, economic issues and housing issues rank among the top three.\n\nOverall, 17 percent of Black Americans said the most important issue is violence or crime - a category that includes drug activity, theft and vandalism, among other offenses. Eleven percent cited economic issues as the most important, 7 percent cited housing and 6 percent cited Covid-19 and public health. Nearly half of Black adults said local leaders are most responsible for addressing these important issues.\n\nA separate poll conducted in March by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research revealed an overwhelming majority of adults say more progress is needed in achieving equal treatment for Black people in dealings with police and the criminal justice system. That's two years after protests against the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis sparked a racial reckoning across the country.\n\nWhen asking about community issues, the survey used an open-ended question, so \"the answer of what Black Americans think is important is a little more multilayered than just violence or crime,\" Cox said, noting that there is so much more that goes into that category than police violence.\n\nThe report also showed that about half of Black people who say being Black is crucial to personal identity feel very or extremely informed about the history of Black people in the U.S. Of that group, about half say they learned that history from family and friends. A large majority, regardless of how Blackness shapes their personal identities, say they have spoken to their families about their own history.\n\n\"The clarity in which family as a source of history for both U.S. Black history, like the kind of history we expect to learn in school, and ancestral history, what we learn about our family histories, was very interesting. It came through so strongly,\" Cox said. \"What that is telling us, is it confirms what scholars and historians have told us about the strength of family for Black Americans, especially in terms of greater knowledge.\"\n\nThe survey of 6,513 U.S. adults, including 3,912 Black Americans, was conducted Oct. 4-17, 2021. The margin of sampling error for Black respondents is plus or minus 2.8 percentage points.\n\nFollow NBCBLK on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .\n\n‎\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "Much of the Black middle class was built by federal jobs. That may change.\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nWhen Francine Verdine took a job as a clerk at the Internal Revenue Service in Houston in 1983, it was supposed to be a stopgap until something better came along. She didn't expect that 42 years later, she would look back on it as the start of a rewarding career that provided growth in various management positions, upward mobility and the opportunity to build a comfortable life for her family.\n\n\"I enjoyed my career,\" said Verdine, who retired in 2019. \"I had no idea when I started that I could make the money I did by the time I left. It's sad that many others' opportunity to have a similar career could be over.\"\n\nFor decades, the federal government provided both reliable jobs and guardrails to offset systemic racial bias in hiring and promotions, offering an alternative for Black workers who might be overlooked or ignored in the private sector. They played a crucial role in helping Black workers like Verdine join the middle class and thrive. But vast cuts by the Trump administration, led by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency , are threatening to close down that once-dependable path to financial stability.\n\nThe government, which has about 3 million employees, is the largest employer in the country. At least 75,000 of them accepted buyout offers and thousands were fired in the last several weeks. Many of the workers fired were either newer hires or told they were let go for subpar performance.\n\n\"The federal workforce was a means to help build Black middle class. It hired Black Americans at a higher rate than private employers,\" said Sheria Smith, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 252, which represents the Education Department employees.\n\nAs a part of his efforts, President Trump is angling to shut down the Department of Education , a move that will have dramatic repercussions around the country. Nearly 30% of Education employees are Black according to a 2024 report by the department.\n\nSmith said 74 workers at the department had been let go so far, 60 of whom are Black.\n\nAt the Department of Health and Human Services, where more than 1,300 new hires were reportedly laid off, 20% of the staff was Black . And at the Department of Veterans Affairs, which recently lost 1,000 employees, 24% are Black .\n\nThese numbers illustrate how important government jobs have been and are for Black people, said Marcus Casey, a fellow in the Economic Studies program at the Brookings Institution. He said the administration's efforts are trying to undermine the gains of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned discrimination on the basis of race and other characteristics, and of affirmative action, which began in the federal government to make the hiring and promoting process more inclusive.\n\n\"Whether it was from the post office, through direct growth of federal agencies, through the military - the government fought against the headwinds associated with the private sector,\" said Casey, an affiliated scholar with Brookings' Future of Middle Class Initiative .\n\nMany Black people could build careers through the federal government typically because the private sector overlooked them, regardless of their qualifications, he said. \"And so, the federal government has been essential to the building of the Black middle class.\"\n\nA worker at the Department of Transportation in Washington, D.C, who requested anonymity for fear of being fired, said several workers in his office have been fired for \"poor performance.\"\n\n\"Morale is so low,\" he said. \"People who should be there are gone. Everyone is nervous about the next shoe dropping.\"\n\nHe said he has 16 years on the job and was planning to retire in four. \"I wanted to do an even 20, maybe even 25. But I have to be honest with myself now: I don't think I'm going to make it. Every indicator is that my head will be chopped off sooner or later. How can anyone be productive with that hanging over you?\"\n\nThe president's sweeping changes began with ending DEI throughout the government, weaponizing it as a \"destructive ideology \" along the way. Countless jobs have been lost in an area that was created to develop fair hiring opportunities.\n\n\"A lot of Black people not only benefited from what they call DEI now, but the original affirmative action programs, and the veteran preferences,\" Casey said. \"That combination helped a lot of people get a foothold in the civil service.\" These efforts, he said, \"helped people get middle-class salaries and build middle-class lives with an ecosystem of race-specific businesses around Black communities.\"\n\nVerdine said it's no secret that the government could be streamlined, but added that the way the administration is going about it is \"disheartening.\"\n\n\"There's no humanity in what's happening right now,\" she said. \"No organization. It's just chaos and people being hurt.\"\n\nAmong those facing the chaos are Verdine's daughter and daughter-in-law, who have disabilities, and are federal workers at the Food and Drug Administration. Under Schedule A, workers with disabilities are allowed a faster hiring process, but their probationary periods are longer than a standard federal employee.\n\nHer family members were reluctant to speak with NBC News about their worries for the future for fear of reprisal. Verdine said they are rightfully fearful, as disabilities are a part of diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility programs that Trump barred two days after being sworn in.\n\n\"You cannot tell where this will go,\" she said. \"My daughter and daughter-in-law live in uncertainty. At any time, based on how this has been going, they can get the call that their job is no more.\"\n\nThe Trump administration did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nVerdine stressed that she had to be qualified for the jobs and promotions she obtained, and in some cases, she felt as though she had to be \"overly qualified\" for positions that she had seen white people, men and women, get with less education, less experience than she had. \"As a matter of fact, I had to train some of those same people. So, the idea that DEI was some pathway to giving Black people jobs, that just wasn't true,\" she said.\n\nSmith, from Local 252, said that although the federal jobs cuts are not labeled as DEI casualties, the pattern is curious.\n\n\"We are concerned as a union that the vagueness of a lot of these executive orders and their implementation are actually a means or pretext to get rid of Black, brown, female members of this workforce for reasons that may not be complying with the law,\" Smith said.  She added that the majority of  people who've been forced out by this administration ostensibly based on DEI do not work in DEI, but \"they happen to be Black.\"\n\nIn addition to regulating America's schools, the Department of Education enforces Title VI \"to make sure that Black and brown students across this country are getting equitable access to education,\" Smith said. \"That work has been stopped. ... We've been told to stop working for the American people.\"\n\nRos Patterson, a 62-year-old benefits department worker at the Veterans Administration in Cole Valley, Illinois, received a phone call on Jan. 28 telling her she had been let go after nearly a year. She said she was told she had 90 minutes to turn in her company laptop.\n\nFlustered and confused, because she was not given a reason for her firing at the time, Patterson drove to Iowa City, Iowa, her closest federal office, and learned that no one there was aware that she was to drop off her laptop - or had papers for her to sign confirming her termination.\n\nEventually, someone helped her. About 30 minutes later she learned from now-former colleagues that all VA workers had been offered a buyout that included eight months pay as part of a severance package.\n\nAs a probationary employee, she said she was not eligible for it. \"I could have used that paycheck as I looked for another job,\" Patterson said.\n\nShe had not planned to retire, but losing her job forced her to, she said, so she could maintain a semblance of her old life. \"I wasn't left any choice,\" said Patterson, who now receives food stamps, is on Medicaid and was approved for Section 8 senior housing. \"I understand probationary employees are quick and easy to fire. But it was done in such a duplicitous manner.\"\n\nShe said she voted for Trump, the orchestrator of the chaos in her life, but is \"not bitter. It is what it is. I'm not blaming Trump. My thing is how it happened. I had no time to process anything or get myself together. It's cold the way it was done,\" she said. \"You'd expect the government to do better.\"\n\nWe're looking to hear from federal government workers.

      "text": "The American dream while Black: 'Locked in a vicious cycle'\n\nHomeownership is supposed to be the gateway to the American dream. Black Americans have been denied access.\n\nShannon Wright / for NBC News\n\nShannon Wright / for NBC News\n\nBy Nigel Chiwaya and Janell Ross Aug. 3, 2020\n\nEbony Jones thought she was one of the lucky ones. Jones, a Black woman in her 30s, inherited a home her grandfather, a World War II veteran, had bought nearly seven decades earlier with the help of his GI Bill benefits.\n\nBut when Jones and her two children moved into the house in Compton, California, which was paid off almost 40 years ago, they soon discovered that sewage sometimes backed up in the living room and that the plumbing needed to be repaired. The distressing process of securing a home equity loan introduced Jones to an American reality.\n\nDespite Jones' good credit score, low debt-to-income ratio, better-than-average income and several thousand dollars of savings, lenders who immediately expressed interest stopped or went quiet when they got to two questions.\n\nWhat was her ZIP code? Answer: 90220. That's Compton, 29 percent Black, 68 percent Latino.\n\nWas she married? Answer: No.\n\nFederal law prohibits lenders from using the answers to those questions to determine a borrower's ability to repay a loan.\n\n\"When I initially apply for a loan online, without fail, I get no problem,\" said Jones, 37. \"They bombard me with emails and letters. Then they see the property address or ask me if I'm married, and everything changes.\"\n\nThe United States is in the midst of a racial reckoning as protests that began in the wake of George Floyd's death in Minneapolis police custody, as well as high Black unemployment due to the coronavirus pandemic, have prompted some Americans to contemplate the ways institutionalized racism and discrimination have constrained Black lives for centuries.\n\nAdvocates, scholars and officials say one of the clearest examples of that ongoing discrimination exists in the housing market, where the gap in homeownership rates between Black and white Americans is wider than it was before the Civil Rights movement.\n\nSeventy-six percent of white households owned their homes at the end of the second quarter of 2020, compared to just 47 percent of Black households, according to the Census Bureau . That 29-percentage-point gap, perpetuated by decades of housing and economic policies favorable toward white buyers and designed to exclude Black buyers, has only been exacerbated by the pandemic and before it the 2008 financial crisis. Homeownership is the prime driver of America's ongoing wealth gap.\n\n\"We have a housing market with different components, including rentals and purchases and financing and insurance, that is really built on a structure that was explicitly racist,\" said Debby Goldberg, vice president of housing policy and special projects at the National Fair Housing Alliance, a consortium of nonprofit anti-housing discrimination organizations. \"It shouldn't be a surprise to anyone looking around to see how segregated we remain. To see this enormous homeownership gap. And hand in hand with that to see the enormous wealth gap that exists.\"\n\nIn Jones' case, being able to live reasonably required access to a home equity loan. Ultimately, just one bank, Navy Federal Credit Union, offered her a loan, but only after making her wait eight months - supposedly to see whether any additional heirs would lay claim to the house, she said - and with the condition that her boyfriend co-sign. Even then, the credit union offered her only $185,000. That's far less than $248,000, or up to 80 percent of the equity Jones had in the home after earlier repairs. That's what lenders typically allow a person with good credit to borrow.\n\nNavy Federal declined to comment on Jones' case, citing its obligation to protect borrowers' privacy. The credit union is \"committed to serving all of our members as a trusted financial partner,\" a Navy Federal spokesperson said by email.\n\nThe consequences of not owning a home or of becoming a homeowner later in life are enormous, experts say. It often leaves a family unable to reach other pillars of the American dream, like tapping into home equity to start a business, survive a job loss or a medical emergency or pay for a child's college education. It is part of the reason a higher percentage of Black households owe student loan debt than white households . And experts say not owning a home makes it harder for Black children to become adult homeowners.\n\n\"Black Americans are locked in a vicious cycle,\" said Andre M. Perry, a fellow in the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution who is author of \"Know Your Price: Valuing Black Lives and Property in America's Black Cities.\"  \"It is the lack of wealth that is the first and most fundamental barrier to homeownership for Black people in this country.\"\n\nAmerica's housing gap ballooned after the New Deal, experts say, when the federal government rolled out a suite of programs to boost homeownership and construction-industry employment in the wake of the Great Depression. Many of the programs, such as the Federal Housing Administration, an agency that oversees federal backing of private mortgage loans, the introduction of the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage and a tax credit for those with mortgages, made buying a home much more affordable for white families.\n\nBut Black households were often left out of the homeownership boom because of redlining, a practice in which the Federal Housing Administration refused to back loans in areas that were occupied predominantly by people of color. Those areas, often lined or shaded red on agency maps, were considered too risky.\n\nOther discriminatory policies also proliferated. In several cities, including Minneapolis, St. Louis, Seattle and Chicago, it wasn't uncommon to see housing deeds that forbade the sale of specific properties to people of color .\n\nAs a result, by 1950 only about a third of Black households owned their homes, compared to more than half of white households.\n\n\"Housing is a story about wealth. Access to housing is one of the ways to generate wealth,\" said Skylar Olsen, senior principal economist at Zillow, an online real estate information platform that regularly analyzes market trends. \"Not having access to housing in the past because of redlining, that really, really impacted generations of wealth building.\"\n\nThe 1968 Fair Housing Act outlawed redlining. But experts say the barriers between Blacks and homeownership didn't evaporate with the law. A Northwestern University study of bias in the housing market published in January found that while overt forms of discrimination - a real estate agent who won't return a phone call or who will deny that a listing is available - have decreased over the past four decades, discrimination in the mortgage market showed little change from 1968 to 2016.\n\nAnd Minneapolis, one of the cities where racially restrictive deeds were prominent during the early 20th century, to this day has the largest homeownership gap in the United States.\n\nExperts say the reasons for the lack of change are baked into the financial system. Black neighborhoods are less likely to have bank branches in them, depriving many households of a chance to build a personal relationship with a banker that can lead to loans and positive credit histories. On-time rent payments aren't tallied into credit scores, while late payments are, creating a system that punishes misfortune while ignoring positive behavior. Rent payments and lower incomes also make it difficult for Black households to save for down payments.\n\nAnd Olsen said that in an era when nearly half of young homebuyers needed gifts from their families to purchase homes , the lack of existing home equity from Black parents makes it harder for their children to purchase homes.\n\nSince the Great Recession, bank lending standards have tightened in a way that bars many moderate-income buyers and those looking to purchase low-cost homes from the world of homeownership, Perry said.\n\nEven when they make it to the mortgage market, Black homebuyers are more likely to be denied mortgages than any other racial group , according to a 2019 report by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , or CFPB.\n\nWhen they are approved for mortgages, Black buyers remain more likely than any other racial group to be charged higher interest rates and to be steered toward predatory loans. And when unemployment rises, as it has during the COVID-19 pandemic , Black households are more likely to lose their jobs and homes. Black Americans were twice as likely to be foreclosed upon during the 2008 financial crisis, Olsen said. They were also far more likely to have been offered high-cost and therefore high-risk loans . Between the second quarter of 2004 and the second quarter of 2019, the Black homeownership rate fell 9.1 percentage points while the white homeownership rate fell 3.1 percentage points.\n\nThe homeownership gap between Black and white Americans on the cusp of retirement reached a 30-year high, according to a 2019 Harvard University Joint Center for Housing Studies Report . And among those ages 50 to 64, the Black/white homeownership gap is even larger, at 27 percentage points.\n\n\"Let's be clear about what those numbers really mean,\" said Odette Williamson, a staff lawyer who oversees the Racial Justice and Equal Economic Opportunity project of the National Consumer Law Center, a nonprofit advocacy group. \"Not only is this a generation of Black people who have less than some before them, less to help cover medical and other expenses at the end of life, less to live on in retirement. This is yet another generation where many will have absolutely nothing to pass on.\"\n\nDuring the Great Recession, a 2007 Rasmussen poll found that 54 percent of Americans believed greedy, dishonest borrowers were to blame for the last housing crisis. The idea, along with racism and a declining sense of white American power , helped to bind the tea party together. But Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who proposed a wave of financial regulations before and after that crisis, blamed banks and Washington lawmakers.\n\n\"Part of the reason for the confusion is that the lenders first peddled their products in communities of color,\" Warren said in an interview. \"They perfected their cheating ways by taking advantage of African Americans and Latinos all across this country. And that just didn't raise anybody's attention.\n\n\"The fact that Black families were being stripped of their homes didn't feel like an urgent problem to the regulators in the Bush administration,\" said Warren, who first proposed the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2007. It became a reality during the Obama administration. \"The lenders ... figured out the most effective ways to cheat people and then sold those products in every community. And that's when they brought down the whole economy.\"\n\nBanks also packaged and sold groups of high-risk, high-cost mortgages like securities.\n\nThose who manage to buy their homes also face a gulf in how their home prices will grow. According to the most recent Federal Reserve Survey of Consumer Finances , the mean net housing wealth for Black households was $94,400 in 2016, less than half the $215,800 mean for white households. And an NBC News analysis of home value estimations from May 2020 on Zillow found that homes in ZIP codes that were predominantly Black were valued at just 60 percent of the value of homes in predominantly white neighborhoods.\n\nAnd prices of Black-owned homes have appreciated far more slowly, as well. An NBC News analysis of home valuations from Zillow from 2010 to 2020 found that price growth of homes in predominantly Black ZIP codes was about half of the growth in predominantly white ZIP codes.\n\nExperts say the same fundamentals that prevent would-be homeowners from getting mortgages keep Black homebuyers from getting loans to perform maintenance on properties and make retailers less interested in setting up shop nearby. Even parks and other public facilities tend to be more common and better maintained by governments in predominantly white areas.\n\n\"So now, not only do I not have as much of an income boost, I also have a limited ability to improve the capital stock,\" said Olsen, of Zillow. \"The quality of the homes becomes more and more disparate between Black and white communities.\"\n\nPerry, of the Brookings Institution, said: \"The long-standing narrative in America is that the conditions of Black neighborhoods and cities are a direct result of the residents in them. People are so ahistorical that they forget there has been a policy violence leveled against Black people that comes out in the wash of research. There has been violence in practice from the nation's appraisers, which are almost 90 percent white . You cannot discount that violence happening on paper and in communities, year after year after year.\"\n\nAs in many other American industries, The Appraisal Institute , an industry trade group, has maintained a \" Diversity Pipeline Initiative \" and has committed to expanding the profession in January.\n\nIn Compton, Jones said, a regular topic of conversation is how happy people are that Compton has its very own big-box store, part of a national chain. That's a meaningful convenience that Jones said she still can't believe people in other parts of the Los Angeles area have the luxury and gall to protest.\n\nWhile the Black homeownership rate has increased since mid-2019, advocates worry that the homeownership gap will only grow, not only because the pandemic has sent Black unemployment to its highest level since the 1980s , but also because federal agencies have walked back Obama-era efforts to combat discrimination.\n\nThe CFPB, the government financial watchdog created under President Barack Obama and proposed by Warren, has drastically scaled back its discriminatory enforcement actions against bank lenders. The agency filed 11 such actions during the Obama era. The actions reclaimed what former Director Richard Cordray, an Obama appointee, described as $12 billion for consumers. After substantial resistance, they created conditions in which lenders knew the agency was watching and behaved accordingly, he said. The agency has filed just one enforcement action since then.\n\nIn July, the Department of Housing and Urban Development terminated a 2015 regulation connected to the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing section of the Civil Rights Act. The rule, which required local governments and jurisdictions receiving HUD funding to analyze systemic barriers to fair and equal housing, was deemed \"unworkable and ultimately a waste of time\" by HUD Secretary Ben Carson, the only Black member of the Trump Cabinet.\n\nIn its place, HUD introduced a rule that lowered the requirements for jurisdictions, allowing them to continue certification as long as they take an \"active step\" toward promoting the agency's new definition of fair housing.\n\nGoldberg, of the National Fair Housing Alliance, said the new rule disregards segregation and other systemic factors in housing.\n\n\"You look around us at what's been going on in this pandemic and you can see the conditions of neighborhoods of color that have been disinvested have put them in harm's way,\" Goldberg said. \"This rule was one of the tools we had to try to tackle the inequalities. To take it away now is just inexplicable and inexcusable.\"\n\nA senior HUD official said that fair housing remains a vital goal to the department and that freeing jurisdictions from paperwork compliance burdens would allow them to continue making progress in promoting fair housing.\n\nBut President Donald Trump in a series of tweets last week appeared to confirm that rescinding the rule was about preventing further racial and economic integration of suburban neighborhoods. Trump, who has repeatedly returned to the racist theme that the American way of life is under assault from Black protesters since the George Floyd protests began, said the rule change was aimed at protecting the \"Suburban Lifestyle Dream\" from \"low income housing built in your neighborhood.\"\n\n...Your housing prices will go up based on the market, and crime will go down. I have rescinded the Obama-Biden AFFH Rule. Enjoy!\n\n\"In the time we were building new suburbs after World War II, we made low-cost credit available to white families and explicitly did not to people of color,\" Goldberg said. \"This is how we thought about the American Dream at that time. That's the image the president is trying to conjure up.\"\n\nCities and states have tried to address parts of the gap. Minneapolis voted in 2019 to increase housing density and, with it, likely residential integration by eliminating single-family home zoning. That will allow apartments, condominiums and townhomes to be built in many more neighborhoods. A similar bill is pending in the California Assembly.\n\nBut advocates say real change must come from the federal government.\n\n\"The benefit of the federal action is that it can be larger-scale,\" Goldberg said. \"It sets a floor for everyone. Everyone has some basic level of protection.\"\n\nWithout leadership from the government, advocates and regulators say, the gap will continue.\n\n\"What I fear,\" said Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., chair of the Financial Services Committee, which regulates banking, \"is that in the absence of so many cops on the beat, now that Trump has installed his people over at the CFPB, at HUD and all the agencies, is that redlining may have returned, that new forms of discrimination are taking shape.\"\n\nThat possibility could distort the lives of generations of Black Americans to come.\n\n\"I think the issue for us is that we don't come from generations of wealth. Most Black people can't say that - they cannot say their parents and their grandparents, aunts and uncles all owned homes,\" Jones said. \"So, to this day, our American Dream looks like an isolated hope.\"\n\n\"I'm trying to break cycles,\" Jones said. \"I'm trying to assure that my children's goal is not survival but to thrive and flourish in a world full of  possibilities that remain easier for some people, white people, to access.\"\n\nNigel Chiwaya is a data reporter for NBC News.\n\nJanell Ross is a reporter for NBC BLK who writes about race, politics and social issues."

In 2020, the enormous number of deaths from Covid-19 - which hit Black Americans particularly hard - erased two decades of progress.\n\nAuthors of the study describe it as a call to action to improve the health of Black Americans, whose early deaths are fueled by higher rates of heart disease, cancer, and infant mortality.\n\n\"The study is hugely important for about 1.63 million reasons,\" said Herman Taylor, an author of the study and director of the cardiovascular research institute at the Morehouse School of Medicine.\n\n\"Real lives are being lost. Real families are missing parents and grandparents,\" Taylor said. \"Babies and their mothers are dying. We have been screaming this message for decades.\"\n\nHigh mortality rates among Black people have less to do with genetics than with the country's long history of discrimination, which has undermined educational, housing, and job opportunities for generations of Black people, said Clyde Yancy, an author of the study and chief of cardiology at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine.\n\nBlack neighborhoods that were redlined in the 1930s - designated too \"high risk\" for mortgages and other investments - remain poorer and sicker today , Yancy said. Formerly redlined ZIP codes also had higher rates of Covid infection and death . \"It's very clear that we have an uneven distribution of health,\" Yancy said. \"We're talking about the freedom to be healthy.\"\n\nA companion study estimates that racial and ethnic inequities cost the U.S. at least $421 billion in 2018, based on medical expenses, lost productivity, and premature death.\n\nIn 2021, non-Hispanic white Americans had a life expectancy at birth of 76 years, while non-Hispanic Black Americans could expect to live only to 71 . Much of that disparity is explained by the fact that non-Hispanic Black newborns are 21⁄2 times as likely to die before their first birthdays as non-Hispanic whites. Non-Hispanic Black mothers are more than 3 times as likely as non-Hispanic white mothers to die from a pregnancy-related complication. (Hispanic people can be of any race or combination of races.)\n\nRacial disparities in health are so entrenched that even education and wealth don't fully erase them, said Tonia Branche, a neonatal-perinatal medicine fellow at Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago who was not involved in the JAMA study.\n\nBlack women with a college degree are more likely to die from pregnancy complications than white women without a high school diploma. Although researchers can't fully explain this disparity, Branche said it's possible that stress, including from systemic racism, takes a greater toll on the health of Black mothers than previously recognized.\n\nDeath creates ripples of grief throughout communities. Research has found that every death leaves an average of nine people in mourning.\n\nBlack people shoulder a great burden of grief, which can undermine their mental and physical health, said Khaliah Johnson, chief of pediatric palliative care at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. Given the high mortality rates throughout the life span, Black people are more likely than white people to be grieving the death of a close family member at any point in their lives.\n\n\"We as Black people all have some legacy of unjust, unwarranted loss and death that compounds with each new loss,\" said Johnson, who was not involved with the new study. \"It affects not only how we move through the world, but how we live in relationship with others and how we endure future losses.\"\n\nJohnson's parents lost two sons - one who died a few days after birth and another who died as a toddler. In an essay published last year , Johnson recalled, \"My parents asked themselves on numerous occasions, 'Would the outcomes for our sons have been different, might they have received different care and lived, had they not been Black?'\"\n\nJohnson said she hopes the new study gives people greater understanding of all that's lost when Black people die prematurely. \"When we lose these lives young, when we lose that potential, that has an impact on all of society,\" she said.\n\nAnd in the Black community, \"our pain is real and deep and profound, and it deserves attention and validation,\" Johnson said. \"It often feels like people just pass it over, telling you to stop complaining. But the expectation can't be that we just endure these things and bounce back.\"\n\nTeleah Scott-Moore said she struggles with the death of her 16-year-old son, Timothy, an athlete who hoped to attend Boston College and study sports medicine. He died of sudden cardiac arrest in 2011, a rare condition that kills about 100 young athletes a year. Research shows that an underlying heart condition that can lead to sudden cardiac death, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, often goes unrecognized in Black patients.\n\nScott-Moore still wonders if she should have recognized warning signs. She also has blamed herself for failing to protect her two younger sons, who found Timothy's body after he collapsed.\n\nAt times, Scott-Moore said, she wanted to give up.\n\nInstead, she said, the family created a foundation to promote education and health screenings to prevent such deaths. She hears from families all over the world, and supporting them has helped heal her pain.\n\n\"My grief comes back in waves, it comes back when I least expect it,\" said Scott-Moore, of Baltimore County, Maryland. \"Life goes on, but it's a pain that never goes away.\"\n\nKFF Health News , formerly known as Kaiser Health News (KHN), is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF - the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.\n\nFollow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook .\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "Influencers and popular podcasts fuel election disinformation among Black voters, report shows\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nAt least 40 million Americans may be regularly targeted and fed disinformation within Black online spaces by a host of sources across social media, fueling false information around the election, according to a new report published Tuesday.\n\nTouted as the first deep dive into understanding disinformation targeting Black America, the report, published by Onyx Impact , a nonprofit organization working to combat disinformation within the Black community, identified half a dozen core online networks \"reaching or targeting\" Black Americans online with false and misleading narratives.\n\nConservative commentators like Candace Owens are among the most influential distributors of false information, according to the report, followed by a variety of sources, such as platforms geared toward the Black manosphere, like the \"Fresh and Fit\" podcast. Some episodes of the show have outright challenged women's intelligence and allowed guests to share false and harmful narratives without pushback.\n\nThe report identifies some platforms like the nationally syndicated radio show, \"The Breakfast Club,\" as a \"gateway influencer\" or an authentic online space that holds critical space for stemming the tide of disinformation. These platforms, however, are also often targets for \"bad actors to introduce harmful narratives,\" according to the report.\n\nThree other effective sources of disinformation, the report notes, are extreme Black nativists and separatists, like Foundational Black Americans who don't believe in the concept of pan-Africanism and have stressed that people who are not descendants of enslaved people should not speak for or on behalf of Black Americans, as well as health skeptics such as Rizza Islam, an activist and self-proclaimed intellectual extremist, who has said without evidence that childhood vaccines \"destroy the brain chemistry\" and lead to autism and other disabilities. According to the CDC , this is not true. None of the other individuals or platforms listed above responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe report also identified foreign actors \"that seek to influence U.S. political discourse,\" like the digital media company African Stream.\n\nAfrican Stream denied spreading misinformation, adding that they \"present an authentically African perspective.\"\n\n\"We have a vigorous fact-checking process, which means work is checked by three different trained journalists three times before posting on our platforms,\" the Nairobi-based company said in a statement, describing their work as a \"Pan-African digital media platform covering affairs concerning Africans at home and in the diaspora.\"\n\nOnyx Impact found those six sources collectively have a potential reach of nearly 41 million Americans, adding that each represents spaces where skepticism, anti-Black rhetoric and deception of truth run rampant. For context, that figure is equivalent to nearly every Black person in the country, according to the latest census data.\n\nOver four months, a team of researchers for Onyx Impact identified 2,500 online accounts creating, sharing or amplifying disinformation to Black communities. The researchers also held seven national focus groups of Black audiences to understand how those narratives were showing up in offline spaces. The point of the effort was to gauge the impact of the information, said the founder of Onyx Impact, Esosa Osa, an alumnus of the voting rights group Fair Fight.\n\nConstant repetition of false or misleading information, \"no matter how kind of absurd that disinformation is,\" said Osa, can be effective across audiences, regardless of income, education or class. \"Disinformation works because the more times that we hear something, the more likely we are to believe that it is true,\" she said.\n\nNarratives with the highest reach and impact across the networks, the report says, include misleading narratives focused on promises that these networks say President Joe Biden has broken, civic engagement and issues that stoke division.\n\nEarlier this year, for example, Owens tweeted without evidence that vaccines cause an \"explosion\" of childhood cancer. But experts, through data , have denied that any link exists. In another instance, Owens shared inaccurate information that the shooter that killed 21 people, including 19 children, at Robb Elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, in 2022 was transgender, an assertion that was based on the wrong photos of the shooter.\n\nCritics have also repeatedly slammed the popular gossip site The Shade Room for being a hub for disinformation, particularly on issues related to Biden. The outlet once reported about a Biden-backed program to distribute \"crack pipes\" to promote health equity. The site ran with an article by The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative website. The post quickly went viral, and the White House called it \"misleading and misinformed.\" In reality, the program was harm-reduction program meant to reduce drug overdoses. The Shade Room corrected the information in a follow-up post and took the original post down, but for many , the misinformation had already spread further than the truth.\n\nThe Shade Room did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe report noted that \"confronting the challenges created by misinformation\" is \"crucial to ensuring the health and stability of our democracy.\"\n\nWhen it is left unchecked, experts said, disinformation can have devastating effects on the most marginalized communities, including harming physical and mental health.\n\nTimothy Welbeck, a civil rights attorney and director of the Center for Anti-Racism at Temple University, said disinformation presented as fact has the \"heightened ability\" to influence Black communities' decision-making in ways never before seen, particularly less than five months from a presidential election.\n\n\"It can either encourage [voter] apathy or potentially encourage people to vote differently than they would have already,\" Welbeck said, noting that Americans' biggest issues, from the economy to Israel's war with Hamas to federal judicial appointments, will greatly be affected by who becomes president in November - in his eyes, a direct byproduct of how successful disinformation continues to spread.\n\nOnyx Impact offered strategic guidance in the report to those combating disinformation to engage with those platforms by identifying trusted messengers and discrediting bad actors. While there is no evidence that African Americans are more susceptible to disinformation than any other ethnic group, Osa said, consistent targeting of any group has a way of breaking through.\n\n\"Black voters are likely less susceptible to many disinformation narratives given their deserved higher levels of skepticism in institutions and government overall,\" she said, \"but just like other communities, when disinformation is targeted and comes from messengers with standing, it can be incredibly effective and dangerous.\"\n\nPolling shows that disinformation remains a concern for most Americans.\n\nA national survey published this month by the media reform group Free Press found that 79% of adults in the U.S. worry that what they read online includes \"fake\" or \"false\" information with the deliberate goal to \"confuse.\" The poll of 3,000 people across the U.S. also found that 76% of respondents are concerned that they were reading misleading information online about the presidential election. Black Americans, in particular, are also disproportionately more likely to get their news from social media, the Free Press survey found.\n\nOsa said there is nothing new about increased disinformation and misinformation ahead of recent presidential elections. In 2016, Russia set out to interfere with the election by spreading propaganda on social media, hacking into campaigns and probing state voter databases, according to a Senate report . In 2020, there were coordinated efforts to deter Black voters from going to the polls more systematically, including conservative activists' making more than a thousand fake robocalls to deter Detroit voters, who are overwhelmingly Black, from voting by mail.\n\nToday, however, Osa said, the way disinformation is presented to a population with outsize political power and influence continues to be more sophisticated. Black Americans are projected to account for 14% of eligible voters in November and have a higher turnout rate than Latino voters, despite making up a lower share of the U.S. population.\n\nRecent outreach to Black voters by Biden and former President Donald Trump is evidence of an emphasis on capturing the demographic.\n\nThe latest NBC News poll found that 2 in 3 Black voters ages 18 to 49 support Biden, as well as 88% of older Black voters.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has garnered support from 1 in 4 young Black voters ahead of this year's election and 6% of older Black voters, according to the NBC News poll, in an election in which even minor changes in voting patterns in battleground states could decide the race.\n\nBy comparison, in 2020, no less than 78% of Black voters chose Biden, according to exit polling data .\n\nBut not all experts believe disinformation efforts have substantial influence now or will have it in the future.\n\nDeen Freelon, a presidential professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania and an expert in digital politics, remains hesitant about overstating how deep misinformation runs within the Black community.\n\n\"It is incredibly difficult to draw a straight line between any kind of communication ... and the kinds of attitudinal and behavioral changes that people would like communication to have,\" he said. \"It's just very hard to change people's minds and their behavior in substantial ways from what they're already doing.\"\n\nHowever, Freelon acknowledged that even a slight change in behavior could tip the race to Biden or Trump.\n\n\"The vast majority of people who consume [disinformation] is a small group of people, but in a close election, a small group of people can be sufficient to, at least potentially, sway the election one way or the other,\" he said.\n\nCORRECTION (June 26, 2024, 12:17 a.m. ET): An earlier version of this article misclassified The Breakfast Club, according to the report's criteria. The report classifies it as a \"gateway influencer,\" not as an outright distributor of false information.\n\nFor more from NBC BLK, sign up for our weekly newsletter .\n\nMarquise Francis is a correspondent for \"Stay Tuned.\"\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Neither did recording artists Prince and Aretha Franklin.\n\nEach time the news broke , there was surprise that such notable names hadn't made estate plans. Yet, estate planning isn't as common as experts argue it should be, including among Black Americans.\n\nOverall, 33 percent of U.S. adults have a will, according to Caring.com's 2021 wills and estate planning survey. Meanwhile, 27.5 percent of Black Americans have one, up from 25.9 percent in 2020.\n\nDespite the growth, Black Americans could miss out on the largest wealth transfer in history, said Brickson Diamond, co-founder of Black House Foundation, a nonprofit aimed at creating new opportunities for the Black community in the film world.\n\nOver the next 25 years, an estimated $68 trillion will be transferred from U.S. households to heirs and charity, according to an analysis of high net worth and ultra-high net worth markets by consulting group Cerulli Associates .\n\nWithout a plan in place, probate costs could be 3 percent to 8 percent of the value of an estate, said Diamond, a board member of Gentreo , an online estate-planning platform.\n\nThere is also a lack of clarity around a loved one's wishes and potential discord that may cause among family members. Then, there is property that may have been in the family for a generation or more.\n\n\"So many families lose their family access and ownership of land,\" he said.\n\n\"So if you haven't prepared to pay the taxes and get the mortgage covered ... the home will at best fall into disrepair and at worst fall out of the hands of the family.\"\n\nTo be sure, Black Americans' median wealth is less than 15 percent of that of white families in the U.S., according to the Federal Reserve's 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances . White families had a median wealth of $188,200, compared to $24,100 for Black families.\n\nThe median Black household wealth was forecast to hit zero by 2053 in a 2017 report by Prosperity Now and Institute for Policy Studies. Then, the pandemic hit, disproportionately affecting Black communities and accelerating that timeline, said Portia Wood, a Los Angeles-based estate attorney who focuses on Black, Latino and LGBTQ families.\n\n\"We are in a state of emergency now,\" she said. \"It is not a 2053 number anymore; it is here.\"\n\nEveryone over the age of 18 should make a plan, Wood said.\n\n\"The misconception that age is a factor, that you're supposed to be old to do estate planning, or you're supposed to be wealthy to do estate planning is just wrong,\" she said.\n\nShe suggests finding a culturally competent attorney to help you, one that understands the specific issues Black Americans face.\n\nThere are also online resources, which may be able to help with basic situations.\n\nHere's a sampling of some documents you'll need apart from a last will and testament:\n\nA last will and testament spells out who you want to give your assets to after you die. It also allows you to name a guardian for any minor children you may have.\n\nWhat's more, people should consider revisiting the plan as life circumstances change. Just don't think of it as one and done, Diamond said.\n\n\"It's continuous,\" he said. \"[It] evolves as your assets evolve, evolves as your family evolves.\"\n\nThen there are trusts, which hold assets on behalf of your beneficiaries instead of those assets going directly to them. Diamond recommends trusts for those with higher asset levels and/or a complicated financial situation.\n\nMore from Invest in You:\n\nHow the Greenwood Project is removing barriers to careers in finance\n\nWant a four-day-workweek job?

Could more Black cardiologists help?\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nFor Elston Harris, heart attacks seem to be a generational curse.\n\nSeveral men from his father's side of the family - including Harris' uncles - died from heart attacks. Harris, who is 59 and a former college basketball player, almost experienced a similar fate after his own heart attack in 2017. The only signs he was having a heart attack that he noticed were \"small\" symptoms of back pain and trapped gas.\n\nFor Harris, the curse may have been a blessing in disguise: While being treated at Advocate Trinity Hospital, a medical center in southeast Chicago, he was referred to Dr. Marlon Everett, a cardiologist who gave him a \"game plan\" to follow. This included putting God first, eating healthy and concentrating on his checkups. But aside from Everett's expertise, Harris said he felt comfortable because Everett looked like him.\n\n\"When you are African American or Black, you're more comfortable interacting with someone who knows, 'OK, he might have grew up here, or he might eat this, or I heard them do that,'\" said Harris, who lives in Chicago. \"So, you're a lot more comfortable with people who walk in similar footsteps.\"\n\nAround 60% of Black American adults have heart disease, and heart disease death rates are highest among Black Americans compared to other racial and ethnic groups, according to the American Heart Association .\n\nYet Harris' experience of having a cardiologist who looks like him is a rarity. A 2021 report by the Association of American Medical Colleges found that only 4.2% of cardiologists are Black. An earlier study, published in 2019 in the journal JAMA Cardiology had similar findings, revealing that Black doctors made up only 3% of the cardiologist workforce. That same report found that 51% of cardiologists were white and 19% were Asian.\n\nIncreasing the number of Black cardiologists could mean better heart health for Black patients.\n\n\"Underrepresented medical professionals are more likely to practice in their communities where cultural sensitivity can create trust and their presence have been shown to improve outcomes,\" the AHA said in a statement to NBC News. \"This connection is particularly important among Black Americans when it comes to heart health.\"\n\nDr. Mary Branch, a cardiologist based in Greensboro, North Carolina, said she first became interested in cardiology nearly 20 years ago, after shadowing a white interventional cardiologist who was \"very accepting of me,\" she said. The path to cardiology is onerous, and includes four years of medical school, three years of internal medicine residency and three years of a cardiology fellowship, in addition to several board exams, she said, which can be a difficult path to follow.\n\nBranch, a fourth-generation physician, said her path also included financial strain and discrimination - hurdles that are all too common for Black medical students and among the reasons, she said, why there are so few Black doctors in cardiology.\n\nBranch was the first Black woman to enter the cardiovascular disease fellowship at the Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. At one point during her fellowship, she said, she lived in a hotel while trying to find secure housing.\n\nEven without a place to stay, Branch said she was \"still showing up\" at her fellowship. \"Really, it was just God saying you're needed,\" she said. \"So, we got to keep going. But that meant a lot of hard choices.\"\n\nMany Black medical students can also experience harsh microaggressions, which can prevent them from becoming a cardiologist, Branch said.\n\nThe margin of error can be \"very small\" for Black trainees, she said. While most medical students and residents of all races perceived high levels of mistreatment, Black people perceived more stress in medical school than white people, according to a 2006 study in the Journal of the National Medical Association. The perceived stress stemmed from their minority status and experiences of racial discrimination in training.\n\nA 2021 study in the Journal of General Internal Medicine found that the proportion of Black doctors in the U.S. had increased by only 4 percentage points over the last 120 years. The study also found that the share of Black male doctors remained the same since 1940. While there's little data on the rates of Black women in cardiology, Black women make up only 2.8% of the physician workforce , according to a 2021 perspective in The Lancet .\n\nEverett, who is a member of the Association of Black Cardiologists, a national organization bringing attention to the harmful impact of heart disease on Black people, cited a lack of adequate training programs for doctors who want to be cardiologists. Most cardiology programs may only have three or four cardiology training positions, but \"we're just not getting those training positions,\" he said.\n\n\"Until there are programs that are mandating that there's diversity in training programs, we're never going to have a lot of inclusivity, especially in the sought-out training programs ... such as cardiology,\" Everett added.\n\nThe organization also plays a role in recruiting Black patients for clinical trials, which have low numbers of Black participants. A 2021 study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association found that Black adults were underrepresented in cardiovascular trials funded by the National Institutes of Health.\n\nThat can mean that doctors don't have the best available information on how to treat Black patients.\n\n\"It's very important to have a lot of Black patients in trials, so we can get better data - and more data means better information, and hopefully better outcomes,\" Everett said.\n\nFor many Black patients, having a Black cardiologist creates feelings of trust and comfort, which is sometimes a challenge due to the medical system's history of racism and mistreatment toward Black patients.\n\nNikita Oxner first saw Branch last year after doctors discovered she had a heart murmur that they detected during a sleep study. Oxner, 45, said up until that point, she had never sought care from a cardiologist, and even being referred to one was \"scary.\" Yet her fears subsided when she met Branch.\n\nUnder Branch's care, Oxner discovered she had a condition that makes it difficult for the heart to pump blood.\n\nHeart-related problems run in Oxner's family. In 2019, hypertension led to her brother's sudden death at age 31, and her grandmother died from heart disease at age 77. Her father, who died from cancer at age 39, \"had hypertension, high blood pressure a majority of his life,\" she said.\n\nOxner said that when she shared details about her brother and other family members to Branch, \"she instantly understood.\" While she \"didn't feel good\" about having surgery to insert a defibrillator in her heart, Oxner trusted her doctor's opinion.\n\n\"She had a lot of compassion,\" said Oxner, who lives in Greensboro, North Carolina. \"She was very understanding, down to earth and relatable - and really helped me understand how this could change my life.\"\n\nAs a Black woman who often has to advocate for her health, Oxner said the fact that Branch was also a Black woman \"mattered to me.\"\n\nBranch said the added layer of trust and comfort often seen between a Black patient and Black doctor can help motivate patients to stay on their heart medications and stick with healthy lifestyle changes.\n\nFor example, \" hypertension is a big thing in our community,\" she said. A Black cardiologist may also be on hypertension medication , she said, \"so, they can relate and connect in that way.\"\n\nLike Oxner, Kia Smith, 42, is another Black woman who sought cardiac care from a Black physician. Smith, who lives in Ellenwood, Georgia, said she saw Dr. Camille Nelson, a cardiologist at Atlanta Heart Associates, in 2020 after experiencing an elevated heart rate. Smith said she believes that if she had chosen a non-Black cardiologist, she may have been treated like \"a dramatic walk-in\" and had her symptoms dismissed .\n\n\"At every turn, when I was concerned, she did not dismiss my concerns or my personal experiences,\" Smith said of Nelson. \"She also explained the science of everything to me, and we were able to get to a place where I was confident that I was going to be OK.\" Nelson said that Smith's symptoms may have stemmed from stress and recommended workout routines to get her heart into a healthier state.\n\nDr. Zainab Mahmoud, a cardiologist and instructor of medicine at Washington University in St. Louis, said many Black women tell her that they feel heard and understood under her care. Having a provider who can understand a Black patient's experiences \"creates this kind of trust and improves a patient-provider relationship,\" she said.\n\n\"They're more likely to then have their family members come or their family and friends come to see me as well,\" Mahmoud added. \"I've seen that happen multiple times I can't even count.\"\n\nIncreasing the number of Black cardiologists has been the focus of major health organizations in recent years.\n\nThe AHA's scholars program provides cardiology resources for Black students from historically Black colleges and universities, where more than 70% of Black medical professionals earn their degrees.\n\nThe organization is also focusing on broader efforts: A strong education can help grow the next generation of Black doctors, nurses and researchers, it said in a statement. One major goal is to increase the number of Black students in graduate science, research and public health programs.\n\nLike the AHA, the American College of Cardiology also implemented diversity efforts through its internal medicine program to introduce Black, Latino and other underrepresented groups into cardiology.\n\n\"The problem is, it's not just cardiology,\" said Dr. Melvin Echols, the ACC's chief diversity, equity and inclusion officer. \"It's all of health care. You see a significant, very low rate of African American doctors. I think what we're trying to do is make it easier, No. 1, for people to actually get information and get resources.\"\n\nHarris, who survived his 2017 heart attack, said it was \"through God's grace\" that he ended up at Advocate Trinity Hospital when his life was on the line - with a cardiologist he could trust.\n\n\"He was there during my episode and we immediately formed a relationship after that,\" Harris said of his cardiologist Everett. Harris has been under his care \"ever since.\"\n\nClaretta Bellamy is a fellow for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

For Black people 65 and older, that figure rises to more than 92 hours each week, according to the report.\n\nCharlene Polite Corley, the vice president of diverse insights and partnerships at Nielsen, told NBC News that consumption of media can be an important source of connection and community for Black Americans, and the report's findings echo this sentiment.\n\n\"When it comes to the media consumption of Black America, it really just means content is key to our culture,\" said Polite Corley, who is Black. \"'Have you seen this show? Have you heard this album? Stream this latest hit.' Those are forms of cultural cachet.\"\n\nBlack Americans are more likely than the general population to access three or more streaming services, according to Nielsen. Around 73% of Black individuals pay for three or more subscription-based streaming services, compared to 60% of all audiences.\n\nOver two-thirds of Black Americans reported feeling that Black representation in TV and media was inadequate. The majority of the Black diaspora surveyed - which includes consumers in the United Kingdom, Brazil, Nigeria and South Africa - agreed that they felt misrepresented in the media.\n\n\"What the prevailing message for me is that the practices of years past where maybe just having one character wasn't enough - the funny best friend or the nice and loving mom,\" Polite Corley said. \"People want the nuance and intersectionality and the authenticity.\"\n\nThese findings echo what other researchers have found about Black representation in parts of media. The majority of Black Americans surveyed in early 2023 told the Pew Research Center that they felt portrayals of Black people are more negative than news about other racial and ethnic groups.\n\nAll of these findings lead to media companies' bottom lines: Around 59% of Black individuals were more likely to support brands that feature Black individuals, according to Nielsen.\n\nIt may also be a missed opportunity for media companies, content creators and brands given the increasing buying power of Black consumers, according to the Nielsen report, which writes that today's Black buying power at $1.7 trillion is estimated to top $2 trillion by 2026.\n\n\"I hope what the report shows is the increased demand, the opportunity to continue to meet that demand, and that this is an investment and not a risk or something that we should be retreating from,\" Polite Corley said.\n\nFor more from NBC BLK, sign up for our weekly newsletter .\n\nEmi Tuyetnhi Tran is an intern for NBC News Digital.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Trump draws pushback after anti-immigration rant\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nWhat exactly are \"Black jobs\" - and are they really at risk from the recent surge of immigrants?\n\n\"They're taking Black jobs now and it could be 18, it could be 19 and even 20 million people,\" former President Donald Trump said in the debate Thursday about the role immigrants play in the U.S. economy. \"They're taking Black jobs, and they're taking Hispanic jobs, and you haven't seen it yet, but you're going to see something that's going to be the worst in our history.\"\n\nThe available data, however, doesn't indicate that immigrants are filling roles en masse that would otherwise go to American citizens.\n\nAnd as Derrick Johnson, CEO of the NAACP, pointed out, \"There's no such thing as a Black job or a white job.\"\n\n\"They're hardworking Americans who are seeking to have quality jobs, and that should be the goal of this conversation,\" he told NBC News. This election cycle - when researchers have found Black voters are being heavily targeted by political disinformation - it is crucial to not turn \"communities against one another,\" Johnson said.\n\nIt's true that Black workers have historically been overrepresented in certain sectors like government and home health care . But Black Americans occupy all rungs of employment, including leadership positions: Eight Fortune 500 companies, an all-time high , are currently run by Black executives, though that rate is far below Black Americans' 14.4% share of the population.\n\nData shows that Black workers have seen gains during both the Biden and Trump administrations. Under Trump, the unemployment rate for the group fell to 5.3% in September 2019 - a record low at the time. It dropped even further under President Joe Biden, to a new low of 4.8% in April 2023.\n\nToday, as the broader U.S. labor market has slowed, Black unemployment has crept up to 6.1% along with the national rate, which has climbed from a low of 3.4% in January 2023 to 4%. But the employment situation for Black workers remains generally favorable.\n\nAnother measure of job-market health, the labor - force participation rate, h a s a lso improved among Black workers under Biden, with 64% of the U.S. Black population in the workforce (employed and unemployed but seeking work), compared with a peak of 63.2% under Trump.\n\nAs the overall economy has slowed, the rate has slipped back to 62.9% - about where it stood for the better part of the Trump administration.\n\nThe all-time labor-force participation record for Black workers - as well as all U.S. workers - came during the Clinton years and has declined since then, largely thanks to baby boomer retirements.\n\nIn May, the White House released a report showing the gains Black workers have made in the past three years, concluding that the robust overall labor market \"has benefited the middle and working classes, especially Black Americans.\"\n\nAs debate-watchers digested Trump's remarks, some voiced confusion and criticized the moderators for not pushing back. Former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms joked in a post on X : \"I have a law degree. Does that get me a #blackjob?\"\n\nCherron Perry-Thomas, a Pennsylvania voter watching the debate in a focus group with NBC News, said Trump has a \"very limited vocabulary\" when discussing Black workers. \"We're very diverse people.\"\n\nAnother Black Pennsylvanian, who spoke to NBC News anonymously to share his thoughts freely, said he would likely back Biden but found himself \"disgusted by the way both of them speak about the Black community.\"\n\n\"In fairness, Trump did positive things for the Black community and he's strategic enough to appeal to Black voters now,\" he said, but added that he felt Biden's record is stronger.\n\nRecent improvements in Black workers' fortunes haven't been uniform. For instance, they are more likely to be union members than any other racial or ethnic group. Yet despite Biden's longtime support for organized labor, union membership rates have fallen during his administration to a record low of 10%, down from 10.8% in 2020.\n\nWhen it comes to pay, inflation-adjusted weekly earnings for Black workers reached a two-decade high of $314 under Trump. That was narrowly surpassed in the fourth quarter of 2023 under Biden, hitting $315. But amid persistent inflation and a cooling job market, Black workers' average weekly earnings declined in the most recent quarter to $293.\n\nAs for whether immigrants are \"taking\" native-born workers' jobs in general, the data suggest they aren't. The Bureau of Labor Statistics  finds that the unemployment rate for U.S.-born citizens remains near all-time lows: 3.8% in May, lower than the nation's 4% unemployment rate overall. It's unlikely that native workers' unemployment would be so low if they were being crowded out by immigrants.\n\nWhile Trump may have been pointing to Black workers' overrepresentation in lower-wage roles, newly arrived immigrants tend to be employed in fields - like construction, food service and agriculture - that would likely go unfilled by native-born workers, whatever their race, experts say.\n\n\"It is clear the labor market is both absorbing immigrants and generating strong job opportunities for U.S.-born workers, including those in demographic groups potentially most impacted by immigration,\" the Economic Policy Institute, a progressive think tank, said ea r lier this year .\n\nSeth Anderson-Oberman, another Pennsylvania voter who watched the debate, found the jobs discussion off-putting.\n\nHe decried \"the constant use of division to try to pit people against each other - Black and brown folk, immigrants, people who are struggling to be able to take care of themselves and their families - pitting us against each other.\"\n\nFor more from NBC BLK, sign up for our weekly newsletter .\n\nRob Wile is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist covering breaking business stories for NBCNews.com.\n\nChar Adams is a reporter for NBC BLK.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Here's why there's so little progress\n\nFrom\n\nBy\n\nFred Clasen-Kelly\n\n,\n\nRenuka Rayasam\n\nMorris Brown, a primary care physician, listens to Sarah McCutcheon's heartbeat in the exam room at his medical office in Kingstree, South Carolina, which sits in a region that suffers from health care provider shortages and high rates of chronic diseases. Gavin McIntyre for KFF Health News hide caption\n\nKINGSTREE, S.C. - One morning in late April, a small brick health clinic along the Thurgood Marshall Highway bustled with patients.\n\nThere was Joshua McCray, 69, a public bus driver who, four years after catching COVID-19, still is too weak to drive.\n\nLouvenia McKinney, 77, arrived complaining about shortness of breath.\n\nPonzella McClary brought her 83-year-old mother-in-law, Lula, who has memory issues and had recently taken a fall.\n\nMorris Brown, the family practice physician who owns the clinic, rotated through Black patients nearly every 20 minutes. Some struggled to walk. Others pulled oxygen tanks. And most carried three pill bottles or more for various chronic ailments.\n\nBut Brown called them \"lucky,\" with enough health insurance or money to see a doctor. The clinic serves patients along the infamous \"Corridor of Shame,\" a rural stretch of South Carolina with some of the worst health outcomes in the nation.\n\n\"There is a lot of hopelessness here,\" Brown said. \"I was trained to keep people healthy, but like 80% of the people don't come see the doctor, because they can't afford it. They're just dying off.\"\n\nAbout 50 miles from the sandy beaches and golf courses along the coastline of this racially divided state, Morris' independent practice serves the predominantly Black town of roughly 3,200 people. The area has stark health care provider shortages and high rates of chronic disease, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease.\n\nSuch racial inequities are especially severe across the Southeast, home to most of the country's Black population.\n\nBut South Carolina remains one of the few states where lawmakers refuse to expand Medicaid, despite research that shows it would provide medical insurance to hundreds of thousands of people and create thousands of health care jobs across the state.\n\nThe decision means there will be more preventable deaths in the 17 poverty-stricken counties along Interstate 95 that comprise the Corridor of Shame, Brown said.\n\n\"There is a disconnect between policymakers and real people,\" he said. The African Americans who make up most of the town's population \"are not the people in power.\"\n\nThe U.S. health care system, \"by its very design, delivers different outcomes for different populations,\" said a June report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. Those racial and ethnic inequities \"also contribute to millions of premature deaths, resulting in loss of years of life and economic productivity.\"\n\nOver a recent two-decade span, mounting research shows, the United States has made almost no progress in eliminating racial disparities in key health indicators, even as political and public health leaders vowed to do so.\n\nAnd that's not an accident, according to academic researchers, doctors, politicians, community leaders, and dozens of other people KFF Health News interviewed.\n\nFederal, state, and local governments, they said, have put systems in place that maintain the status quo and leave the well-being of Black people at the mercy of powerful business and political interests.\n\nJoshua McCray, of Kingstree, South Carolina, retired as a public bus driver after he caught COVID and nearly died. During the pandemic, Black Americans were more likely to hold jobs - in fields such as transportation, health care, law enforcement, and food preparation - that the government deemed essential to the functioning of society, making them more susceptible to the virus. Gavin McIntyre for KFF Health News hide caption\n\nAcross the nation, authorities have permitted nearly 80% of all municipal solid waste incinerators - linked to lung cancer, high blood pressure, higher risk of miscarriages and stillbirths, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma - to be built in Black, Latinx, and low-income communities, according to a complaint filed with the federal government against the state of Florida.\n\nFederal lawmakers slowed investing in public housing as people of color moved in, leaving homes with mold, vermin, and other health hazards.\n\nAnd Louisiana and other states passed laws allowing the carrying of concealed firearms without a permit even though gun violence is now the No. 1 killer of kids and teens. Research shows Black youth ages 1 to 17 are 18 times more likely to suffer a gun homicide than their white counterparts.\n\n\"People are literally dying because of policy decisions in the South,\" said Bakari Sellers, a Democratic former state representative in South Carolina.\n\nKFF Health News undertook a yearlong examination of how government decisions undermine Black health - reviewing court and inspection records and government reports, and interviewing dozens of academic researchers, doctors, politicians, community leaders, grieving moms, and patients.\n\nFrom the cradle to the grave, Black Americans suffer worse health outcomes than white people. They endure greater exposure to toxic industrial pollution, dangerously dilapidated housing, gun violence, and other social conditions linked to higher incidence of cancer, asthma, chronic stress, maternal and infant mortality, and myriad other health problems. They die at younger ages, and COVID shortened lives even more .\n\nDisparities in American health care mean Black people have less access to quality medical care, researchers say. They are less likely to have health insurance and, when they seek medical attention, they report widespread incidents of discrimination by health care providers, a KFF survey shows. Even tools meant to help detect health problems may systematically fail people of color.\n\nAll signs pointed to systems rooted in the nation's painful racist history, which even today affects all facets of American life.\n\n\"So much of what we see is the long tail of slavery and Jim Crow,\" said Andrea Ducas , vice president of health policy at the Center for American Progress, a nonprofit think tank.\n\nPut simply, said Jameta Nicole Barlow , a community health psychologist and professor at George Washington University, government actions send a clear message to Black people: \"Who are you to ask for health care?\"\n\nThe end of slavery gave way to laws that denied Black people in the U.S. basic rights, enforced racial segregation, and subjected them to horrific violence.\n\n\"I can take facts from 100 years ago about segregation and lynchings for a county and I can predict the poverty rate and life expectancy with extraordinary precision,\" said Luke Shaefer , a professor of social justice and public policy at the University of Michigan.\n\nStarting in the 1930s, the federal government sorted neighborhoods in 239 cities and deemed redlined areas - typically home to Black people, Jews, immigrants, and poor white people - unfit for mortgage lending. That process concentrated Black people in neighborhoods prone to discrimination.\n\nLocal governments steered power plants, oil refineries , and other industrial facilities to Black neighborhoods, even as research linked them to increased risks of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, cancer, and preterm births.\n\nMorris Brown, a primary care physician, says that South Carolina lawmakers' refusal to expand Medicaid will result in preventable deaths because many people who live near his medical offices in Kingstree and Lake City cannot afford to go to a doctor. (Gavin McIntyre for KFF Health News) Gavin McIntyre for KFF Health News hide caption\n\nThe federal government did not even begin to track racial disparities in health care until the 1980s, and at that time disparities in heart disease, infant mortality, cancer, and other major categories accounted for about 60,000 excess deaths among Black people each year. Elevated rates of six diseases, including cancer, addiction, and diabetes, accounted for more than 80% of the excess mortality for Black and other minority populations, according to \" The Heckler Report ,\" released in 1985. During the past two decades there have been 1.63 million excess deaths among Black Americans relative to white Americans. That represents a loss of more than 80 million years of life, according to a 2023 JAMA study .\n\nRecent efforts to address health disparities have run headlong into racist policies still entrenched in health systems. The design of the U.S. health care system and structural barriers have led to persistent health inequities that cost more than a million lives and billions of dollars, according to the National Academies report.\n\n\"When COVID was first hitting, it was just sort of immediately clear who was going to suffer the most,\" Ducas said, \"not just because of differential access to care, but who was in a living environment that's multigenerational or crowded, who is more likely to be in a job where they are an essential worker, who is going to be more reliant on public transportation.\"\n\nFor example, in spring 2020, the North Carolina health department, led by current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Mandy Cohen, failed to get COVID testing to vulnerable Black communities where people were getting sick and dying from COVID-related causes at far higher rates than white people.\n\nAnd Black Americans were far more likely to hold jobs - in areas such as transportation, health care, law enforcement, and food preparation - that the government deemed essential to the economy and functioning of society, making them more susceptible to COVID, according to research .\n\nUntil Joshua McCray, the bus driver in Kingstree, S.C., got COVID in his mid-60s, he was strong enough to hold two jobs. He ended up on a feeding tube and a ventilator after he contracted COVID in 2020 while taking other essential workers from this predominantly Black area to jobs in a whiter, wealthier tourist town.\n\nNow he cannot work and at times has difficulty walking.\n\n\"I can tell you the truth now: It was only the Good Lord that saved him,\" said Brown, the rural physician who treated McCray and many patients like him.\n\nFederal and state governments have spent billions of dollars to implement the Affordable Care Act, the Children's Health Insurance Program, and other measures to increase access to health care. Yet, experts said, many of the problems identified in \"The Heckler Report\" persist.\n\nWhen Lakeisha Preston in Mississippi was diagnosed with walking pneumonia in 2019, she ended up with a $4,500 medical bill she couldn't pay. Preston works at Maximus, which has a $6.6 billion contract with the federal government to help people sign up for Medicare and Affordable Care Act health plans.\n\nShe is convinced that being a Black woman made her challenges more likely.\n\n\"Think about how many centuries the same thing has been happening,\" said Preston, noting how her mother worked two jobs her entire life without a vacation and suffered from health conditions including diabetes, cataracts, and carpal tunnel syndrome. Today Preston can't afford to put her 8-year-old son on her health plan, so he's covered by Medicaid.\n\nIn email exchanges with the Biden administration, spokespeople insisted that it is making progress in closing the racial health gap. They said officials have taken steps to address food insecurity, housing instability, pollution, and other social determinants of health that help fuel disparities.\n\nPresident Joe Biden issued an executive order on his first full day in office in 2021 that said \"the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed and exacerbated severe and pervasive health and social inequities in America.\" Later that year, the White House issued another executive order focused on improving racial equity and acknowledged that long-standing racial disparities in health care and other areas have been \"at times facilitated by the federal government.\"\n\n\"The Biden-Harris Administration is laser focused on addressing the health needs of Black Americans by dismantling persistent structural inequities,\" said Renata Miller, a spokesperson for the administration.\n\nThe CDC, along with some state and local governments , declared racism a serious public health threat.\n\nU.S. Rep. Alma Adams, a North Carolina Democrat, pushed for \"Momnibus\" legislation to reduce maternal mortality. Yet federal lawmakers left money for Black maternal health out of the historic Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.\n\n\"I come to this space as an elected official, knowing what it is like to be poor, knowing what it is like to not have insurance and having to get up at 3, 4 in the morning with my mom to take my sister to the emergency room,\" Adams said.\n\nIn the 1960s in North Carolina, Adams and her family would take her sister Linda, who had sickle cell anemia, to the emergency room because they had no doctor and could not afford health insurance. Linda died at the age of 26 in 1971.\n\n\"You have to have some sensitivity for this work,\" Adams said. \"And a lot of folks that I've worked with don't have it.\"\n\nDr. Morris Brown's medical practice serves the predominantly Black town of Kingstree, S.C. (population roughly 3,200). The area has stark health care provider shortages and high rates of chronic disease, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease. Gavin McIntyre for KFF Health News hide caption\n\nThe website for Kingstree depicts idyllic images of small-town life, with white people sitting on a porch swing, kayaking on a river, eating ice cream, and strolling with their dogs. Two children wearing masks are the only Black people in the video, even though Black people make up 70% of the town's population.\n\nBut life in Kingstree and surrounding communities is marked by poverty, a lack of access to health care, and other socioeconomic disadvantages that have given South Carolina poor rankings in key health indicators such as rates of death and obesity among children and teens.\n\nSome 23% of residents in Williamsburg County, which contains Kingstree, live below the poverty line, about twice the national average, according to federal data.\n\nThere is one primary care physician for every 5,080 residents in Williamsburg County. That's far less than in more urbanized and wealthier counties in the state such as Richland , Greenville , and Beaufort .\n\nEdward Simmer, the state's interim public health director , said that if \"you are African American in a rural zone, it is like having two strikes against you.\"\n\nAsked if South Carolina should expand Medicaid, Simmer said the challenges South Carolina and other states confront are worsened by health care provider shortages and structural inequities too large and complicated for Medicaid expansion alone to solve.\n\n\"It is not a panacea,\" he said.\n\nBut for Brown and others, the reason South Carolina remains one of the few states that have not expanded Medicaid - one step that could help narrow disparities with little cost to the state - is clear.\n\n\"Every year we look at the data, we see the health disparities and we don't have a plan to improve,\" Brown said. \"It has become institutionalized. I call it institutional racism.\"\n\nA July report from George Washington University found that Medicaid expansion would provide insurance to 360,000 people and add 18,000 jobs in the health care sector in South Carolina.\n\n\"Racism is the reason we don't have Medicaid expansion. Full stop,\" said Janice Probst, a former director of the Rural and Minority Health Research Center in South Carolina. \"These are not accidents. There is an idea that you can stay in power by using racism.\"\n\nSouth Carolina's Republican governor, Henry McMaster, in July vetoed legislation that would have created a committee to consider Medicaid expansion, saying he did not believe it would be \"fiscally responsible.\"\n\nExpanding Medicaid in the state could result in $4 billion in additional economic output from an influx of federal funds in 2026, according to the July report.\n\nBeyond health care coverage and provider shortages, Black people \"have never been given the conditions needed to thrive,\" said Barlow, the George Washington University professor. \"And this is because of white supremacy.\"\n\nKFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF .\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

But as white supremacy reminds us, their importance - their relevance - comes with a healthy dose of violence and utter disrespect for people of color like me.\"\n\nFor more than a week, tens of thousands of people have thronged cities nationwide, staging protests. The demonstrations were triggered by the death of 46-year-old George Floyd while in police custody in Minneapolis on Memorial Day.

This amid the COVID-19 pandemic, which has seen a disproportionate number of deaths among African Americans, exacerbating challenges in these uncertain times for a people often racially profiled and long oppressed.\n\nCities are burning. Not just with fires but with anger.\n\nBlack people say they are frustrated. Fearful. Fatigued.\n\n\"I'm not going to lie - I am angry,\" said Ellington, a 41-year-old marketing professional who has a 10-year-old daughter. \"As a black man in America, it is already hard enough that we have to fight within ourselves to become a better person, but there are countless forces working outside of ourselves that are also working against us and have been for generations.\"\n\nEllington is one of nearly 200 people who shared with NPR what it's like to be black in America right now.\n\nNicholas Gibbs of Spring, Texas, is particularly concerned about his two toddler sons growing up.\n\n\"To be black in America, you have to endure white supremacy. You have to fear the police. To be American, you have the luxury of saying, 'They should have complied!' To be black in America, you have to hope someone recorded your compliance because you may no longer be around to defend yourself,\" the 39-year-old said.\n\nAlexander Pittman, who lives in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., said there's a huge amount of anxiety on a daily basis regarding any contact with police even if you are doing nothing wrong or illegal, because you know it could escalate out of control.\n\n\"Being a black man in America, you know you live by a different set of rules,\" Pittman said.\n\nHe recounted what happened to him a few years ago when he'd just moved to Hollywood, Fla., and went out one evening to walk his dog, Marley.\n\n\"I was confronted by several Hollywood police officers. I was also roughed up and detained before being let go,\" the 32-year-old said, adding that no charges were filed against him.\n\nAs dad to a 4-year-old and a public school teacher, Pittman said he tries to have real conversations with his students and son about the role that race has played in the U.S. historically - and today.\n\n\"It's hard, because on one hand I don't believe in riots, looting and violence, but on the other hand, when is enough, enough? We need real, tangible policing reform on a national level, and that has largely been ignored.\"\n\nThe Rev. Carol Thomas Cissel says being black in America is about playing her part to help alleviate racial inequality. Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Centre County hide caption\n\nMany black mothers in America expressed fear for the boys and men in their lives.\n\n\"I'm weary of living in a constant state of anxiety and fear because I have black and brown men in my life: my son, brothers, friends, grandson, son-in-law and father. I'm bone tired of existing in a system that tells me every damn day that me and my people do not matter,\" said the Rev. Carol Thomas Cissel of State College, Pa.\n\nA mother, minister and grandmother, Cissel said her \"DNA will continue to scream in agony\" because black men and boys are not safe in America.\n\n\"I will try to hold the pain and soul wounds of my people. I will mourn because I know wishes, words or rituals cannot keep my son and grandson alive.\"\n\nJami Vassar, a 34-year-old fourth-generation military veteran from Aberdeen, N.C., can relate. As a mom of two teenage sons, she worries about their well-being and tries to keep them close.\n\n\"They are my gentle giants, but they are big black boys, and I have to remind them that the world doesn't see them as kids and there is real danger just for existing,\" she said.\n\nVassar said although she comes from a family of proud Americans who boast a long line of service to the country, the world sees them as black first. Just last week while driving with her younger son, she said he expressed fears about getting pulled over. He'll be getting his driver's license soon.\n\n\"I had to tell him I'm afraid when I get pulled over. My family has served in every war since War World I. They served before African Americans could vote, and we continue to serve even though we are not always seen as equals. It hurts,\" she said.\n\nAnother mom, Edith Jennings of Holyoke, Mass., said she too worries about her two adult sons. Last week on an unusually balmy spring day in New England, while driving through a small area with one of them, they noticed two young white men standing by their bicycles, laughing and talking to each other.\n\n\"My son, who is 28 years old and now a new father of his own son, said, 'It must be nice to wake up in the morning and feel safe, to not be afraid to go out and do what you have to do for the day, to hang out with your friends, not be afraid of the police. I wonder what that is like.' When I heard that, I was almost in tears,\" Jennings said.\n\nHaving grown up in the 1960s and '70s and remembering a story her mom told about watching the Ku Klux Klan burning crosses in her yard, Jennings said she never expected to have to deal with such racial issues when she had her own kids.\n\n\"Now here we are in the 21st century and I have a 2-month-old grandson, and I wonder if he, as a young black man, will survive in America. I feel like black men and women are an endangered species here in America. That's what's it like being black in America now!\"\n\nProtesters in Miami hold signs during a rally Sunday in response to the recent death of George Floyd.

She recalls white men standing on the corner and calling out the N-word as she passed by.\n\n\"All you had to be was a person of color to feel the hatred when you went near a white man. A feeling of fear, oppression, being disliked, having no rights, and the fear of being killed with a lie trailing behind the death,\" she said.\n\nOther mothers shared their concern that nothing will change.\n\n\"People are tired of empty protests that fail to deliver change. Some care more about dogs than the lives of black and brown people in America,\" said Nicole Green of Melbourne, Fla., who said her childhood memories are filled with relatives being pulled over or being harassed by police.\n\nFree Browning said the situation in the country is disheartening, particularly for a person who suffers from anxiety and depression.\n\n\"As a single mom of three and an Atlanta native, I'm angry, horrified, scared, hurt and uneasy. While I don't condone the destruction of many of the businesses here in Atlanta, I have lost my concern to care.\"\n\nOthers said being black in America can feel like being at war.\n\n\"I recently purchased two guns and plan on purchasing more,\" said 62-year-old Bruce Tomlin of Albuquerque, N.M.\n\nTomlin said he dealt with a lot of racial tension living for more than three decades in Texas. While he says Albuquerque is different, he travels often out of state as a truck driver. After watching the video of Arbery being shot, he said he wants to be able to defend himself.\n\n\"I feel every person of color in America should be armed. I feel that the current administration and the 1% are guiding us into a civil war,\" he said. \"I also feel that it is open season on black males in particular. People of color are being eliminated by police and disease. I plan on fighting until the end.\"\n\nMichael Martin of Chicago said he feels like there's nothing he can do to protect himself and his family.\n\n\"We can't go jogging without worrying about being lynched; we can't go bird-watching without having the police called on us. Our children can't go outside and play without us worrying about them being gunned down and labeled 'suspects.' We can't sleep in our own beds without being executed,\" he said. \"The same rights and protections that our white peers are afforded are not afforded to us. We can't arm ourselves without being labeled thugs and shot.\"\n\nSome people feel conflicted. Helpless. Ambivalent. Mentally drained.\n\n\"Last night I cried to my partner,\" said Glenn Smith of Brooklyn, N.Y. \"I cried because I realized how proud I am to be an American, a New Yorker and a Brooklynite. I cried because in those feelings of pride, I'm faced with feelings of contradiction. Why are cops brutally killing people that look like me?\"\n\nCheyenne Amaya of Woodbridge, Va., said police-involved deaths no longer surprise her.\n\n\"They are so a part of my normal life now that I feel a bit desensitized. I still have to continue to try to put a brave face on while feeling angry, hurt, sad, anxious and tired. It's been like this my whole life,\" she said. \"We were taught at a young age to make ourselves appear less threatening and to always keep our hands up. It's tiring trying to live your life while constantly in fear of someone shooting you down or accusing you of something you didn't do.\"\n\nWaddell Hamer of Indianapolis, who recently graduated with his master's degree in social work, said: \"The mental health of blacks during this time is fragile. I know mine is. COVID, racism and poverty to name a few. How do I tend to the mental health of blacks during this time?\"\n\nStill, amid these myriad emotions expressed by black Americans, some spoke of hope.\n\nCissel, the minister from Pennsylvania, said that for \"all my people to be safe, the racist fabric of this country must be ripped to shreds and rewoven.\"\n\nShe's ready to do her part.\n\n\"I will light a candle, hope it blossoms into a steady flame of peace and say these words aloud: 'We are included. We belong. We are here.' For, just like you - entitled by birthright, we have a place in this world too.\"\n\nNPR would like to hear about your reaction to these incidents and your personal experience as a black person in America.

The open carry rally is organized by an activist group known as BLM757 in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and the Second Amendment.\n\nEditor's note: NPR will be continuing this conversation about Being Black in America online and on air.\n\nBruce Tomlin, a 63-year-old truck driver from New Mexico, said he was never really a \"gun person.\" Then he saw a video of three white men following and fatally shooting Ahmaud Arbery while he was jogging.\n\n\"The man is trying to get away and they're just gunning him down in the street like he was a dog,\" Tomlin said about watching the video of Arbery. \"It's made me hypervigilant. It has made me nervous. I'll even admit to being a little bit scared sometimes.\"\n\nSo he bought a gun. And he's planning on buying more.\n\n\"I just feel like in my viewpoint, every Black person in America, especially Black males, needs to have some type of protection with them as often as [they] can, because I think the political climate [is] getting to the point where it's just going to be a lot of violence coming our way,\" Tomlin said. \"I just feel safer now having a gun. And I didn't always feel that way. I've never been the world's biggest fan of guns, but I just don't feel safe without one.\"\n\nIn early June, NPR reached out to Black Americans to ask about their personal experiences in this country. Nearly 500 people responded, some of whom described wanting to buy - or decidedly not wanting to buy - firearms for self-defense in response to the recent fight for racial justice.\n\nTomlin is one of many Black Americans who recently bought firearms for the first time, faced with a combination of the coronavirus pandemic and the fight for racial justice.\n\n\"The highest overall firearm sales increase comes from Black men and women, who show a 58.2% increase in purchases during the first six months of 2020 versus the same period last year,\" Jim Curcuruto, the National Shooting Sports Foundation director of Research and Market Development, wrote in a report , according to AOL News. \"Bottom line is that there has never been a sustained surge in firearm sales quite like what we are in the midst of.\"\n\nPhilip Smith, the president of the National African American Gun Association, said that he had a massive influx of members in two waves: Once, in 2016, following President Donald Trump's election, and again during the recent  racial justice protests. He said a year ago, NAAGA was getting maybe 10 new members a day; now, its seeing 10 new members an hour. He said there are many factors pushing Black people to buy firearms, including \"the politics right now, the pandemic and the racial tone: Those three things together act as kind of a three-headed monster that is driving folks to come to us.\"\n\nWhile there may be an uptick in Black people owning guns in the United States today for protection, it's not necessarily a new phenomenon. The majority of gun owners are white men, but in a 2017 survey by the Pew Research Center , 24% of Black people reported owning a gun, compared to 36% of white people.\n\nIfeoma Ozoma, a 28-year-old who works in tech policy, owned guns for self-protection long before the recent protests erupted across the nation. She grew up in Alaska, with familiarity with firearms, and always knew she wanted to own one for self defense. So, after graduating college, she started buying them.\n\n\"My gun ownership is not connected to the political movement,\" Ozoma said. \"It's connected more to the history of the country, and I am adherent to both the First and the Second amendment and so I am practicing both, I believe, in owning guns.\"\n\nAcross races, since the 1970s, gun ownership has shifted away from hunting and sport and towards self-defense - and one of the most fierce advocates for the right to bear arms in public, particularly for protection, was the Black Panthers . Malcolm X said African Americans had to defend themselves \"by whatever means necessary.\" Even Martin Luther King Jr. applied for a permit to carry a concealed firearm in 1956 , shortly after his house was bombed. His application was denied, but he had armed supporters guarding his home.\n\n\"I'm a student of history and political science, and I think what we're dealing with now, and it's the same with most societies, is like frog boiling, where you don't realize how bad things are because they just get incrementally worse,\" Ozoma said. \"And we've taken some big, big leaps this year in getting incrementally worse. But if there was a societal breakdown, my first assumption is not that the police ... is going to make a priority of protecting Black citizens. And so I would like to have my own form of protection.\"\n\nArmed members of the Black Panther Party leave the Capitol in Sacramento May 2, 1967.

The Panthers entered the Capitol fully armed and said they were protesting a bill before the Legislature restricting the carrying of arms in public.\n\nSome people in the United States do tend to buy firearms in reaction to emergencies: Gun sales spiked after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and in response to the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., and, according to the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System , twice as many Americans underwent background checks for handgun purchases in March 2020 as they had two months earlier.\n\nKat Traylor, of Aurora, Colo., first started thinking about buying a weapon when she saw empty grocery shelves at the start of the pandemic. Like Ozoma, she's thought about chance encounters with police, too.\n\n\"Elijah McClain was murdered in my city,\" Traylor said, referring to the death of a Black man who died following an encounter with law enforcement last year.\n\nPolice put McClain in a chokehold. Paramedics  injected him with an anesthetic called ketamine. Aurora has since opened an independent investigation into his death, as has Colorado's attorney general. McClain's parents have filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the city and several of its police officers. Traylor said she doesn't necessarily envision using her firearm, particularly against police, but having it gives her some sense of control.\n\n\"What we as a family had to determine is how do we want to...die,\" she explained slowly. \"It's sad to look at it that way. Do we want to die not being prepared? Or at least trying to protect ourselves. That's how you weigh that.\"\n\nKat Traylor and her husband Kevin Cox at a gun range. Leigh Paterson/Courtesy Leigh Paterson hide caption\n\nKat Traylor and her husband Kevin Cox at a gun range.\n\nAt the same time, data shows owning a gun might not actually make you safer. Larry Green, a 68-year-old in Phoenix, doesn't want to buy or own a gun for exactly that reason. He pointed to Philando Castile, a registered gun owner who was shot and killed by a police officer on July 6, 2017, in a St. Paul, Minn.,  suburb after he told the officer he was armed. Green was pulled over in Phoenix the week Castile was killed, and the officer asked if he had a gun in the car. He was thankful that he didn't.\n\nOzoma understands the point that Castille was a legal gun owner who was shot and killed anyway, but she says that doesn't make her shy away from her gun ownership.\n\n\"Philando Castile was just pulling for his license to show that he had the right to have a gun. Breonna Taylor was lying in bed with her partner who was lawfully using his weapon against some people who broke into their apartment and did not announce who they were,\" Ozoma said. \"So it doesn't really matter either way, whether I'm armed or not, I could be killed or be attacked. And I'd rather be armed.\"\n\nTomlin agrees.\n\n\"I'd rather go to trial than go to the cemetery,\" he said.\n\nKUNC reporter Leigh Paterson contributed to this report.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

The hashtag started five years ago and is an \"archetypal\" example of a hashtag tied to political issues or causes. Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images hide caption\n\nA demonstrator holds a \"Black Lives Matter\" sign while protesting then-presidential candidate Donald Trump in 2016. The hashtag started five years ago and is an \"archetypal\" example of a hashtag tied to political issues or causes.\n\nFive years ago, when George Zimmerman was acquitted in the shooting death of an unarmed 17-year-old named Trayvon Martin, the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter lit up the social media universe and ignited powerful dialogue around racial injustice and police brutality.\n\nA recent study from the Pew Research Center shows that the hashtag remains relevant - it's used an average of about 17,000 times a day. #BlackLivesMatter has inspired the start of other hashtag movements, highlighting the role of social media in modern American activism and protest, especially for underrepresented communities, the survey finds.\n\nMore than half of all Americans have engaged in at least one \"political or social-minded activity\" on social media in the past year, according to the study. They include people looking up information on local protests, using hashtags relating to a political issue, or encouraging others to take action.\n\nSome groups are more likely to participate in these activities, including Democrats and Americans aged 18-49.\n\nThe study also reveals that while a majority of Americans believe that social media are important in accomplishing a range of political goals, black Americans - eight in 10 - value the platforms for magnifying issues that aren't usually discussed. A smaller share of Hispanics and whites - around 60 percent for each group - share the same sentiment.\n\nAs a whole, however, a majority of Americans are largely skeptical about the broader impact of social media on political discourse: Seventy-seven percent of Americans feel that social networking sites are distracting and 71 percent of the American population says \"social media makes people believe they're making a difference when they really aren't\" - what's commonly referred to as \" slacktivism .\"\n\nThe study reveals that whites are more likely than the rest of the U.S. population to think social media platforms have a negative impact .\n\nDespite the varying opinions by race, a majority of Americans still have an overall positive impression of social media's ability to help enact political change. Sixty-nine percent of U.S. adults say the platforms help raise awareness of issues to politicians and 67 percent say they assist with creating sustained social movements.\n\nFor minority social media users, however, it's even more personal: Black and Hispanic social media users are more likely than whites to say that social sites help them find politically like-minded people, get involved with issues that are important to them and express their political views.\n\nA prime example of this is the consistent presence of the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag on Twitter. The study finds that it continues to spike following the highly publicized fatal deaths of black Americans by law enforcement, and refers to #BlackLivesMatter as an \"archetypal example\" of hashtags associated with political issues or causes.\n\nThe most notable of spikes for #BlackLivesMatter occurred in a span of roughly 10 days in the summer of 2016, when the deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile - both of which were captured on video and published on social media  - happened within a day of each other. The hashtag averaged nearly 500,000 tweets daily and prompted the use of the opposing hashtags #BlueLivesMatter and #AllLivesMatter. The Pew Research Center study also analyzed that these hashtags are commonly mentioned around topics of race, law enforcement and violent acts.\n\nThe influence of racialized social media movements was spotlighted last week when Facebook announced that it removed fake Facebook and Instagram accounts or pages associated with a political influence campaign linked to the Russian government. The pages had exploited names like \"Black Elevation\" and \"Resisters,\" and organized counterprotests to white nationalist rallies in Washington.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Here, Abel Woldu and Dr. Kelsey Angell participate in the University of Minnesota's white coat ceremony in 2022. Half of that incoming class of doctors-in-training are people of color.\n\nMany people of color in this country say they have to change the way they dress and mentally brace themselves for potential mistreatment when they visit the doctor. That's one of the sobering findings of a large new survey that probes the extent and implications of discrimination in American life, including health care.\n\nThe survey was conducted by the health research organization KFF. Researchers polled a nationally representative sample of nearly 6,300 adults.\n\nThe good news is that, among those that had sought health care in the past three years, people reported having positive and respectful interactions with their health care providers most of the time.\n\nBut the survey also uncovered troubling differences along racial and ethnic lines. Black, Hispanic, Asian and American Indian and Alaska native adults were much more likely than their white counterparts to report having negative interactions during health care visits.\n\n\"Things like a provider not listening to them, not answering a question or responding to a direct request, not prescribing pain medication that they thought they needed,\" says Samantha Artiga , director of racial equity and health policy at KFF.\n\nFor example, twice as many Black women who'd given birth in the last decade said they'd been refused pain medications they'd thought they'd needed, compared to white women. Numerous previous studies have found that Black patients are less likely to receive appropriate pain medication than white patients.\n\nAnd overall, at least a quarter people of color said that doctors were less likely to involve them in decisions about their care. In some cases, Artiga says some survey respondents shared specific stories in which their concerns were initially dismissed, only later to be found to be a serious health condition.\n\nArtiga says these types of experiences with unfair treatment may help explain why large shares of the respondents of color who took the survey said they took certain steps to prepare for health care visits at least some of the time.\n\n\"For example, feeling like they have to dress very carefully or take a lot of care with their appearance in order to be respected and listened to by their health care provider, or saying that they sometimes prepare for possible insults from health care providers during health care visits,\" Artiga says. Six-in-10 Black respondents said they are careful about how they present themselves and/or expect to be insulted in health care settings.\n\nAnother disturbing finding of the study is that Black adults with self-reported darker skin tones report more discrimination in everyday life. Sixty-two percent of Black adults who say their skin color is \"very dark\" or \"dark\" reported incidents of discrimination in the past year, compared to 42% Black adults who say their skin color is \"very light\" or \"light.\"\n\nPeople of color were much more likely to report having respectful, positive interactions when their health care providers shared their racial or ethnic background.\n\nThat's in line with a growing body of research that has found patients of color are more likely to be satisfied with health care interactions, and more likely to adhere to medical recommendations, when their doctors look like them. One recent nationwide study even found that Black patients lived longer if they resided in counties with more Black physicians.\n\nHowever, data from the Association of American Medical Colleges show Black and Hispanic doctors remain vastly underrepresented relative to their share of the U.S. population.\n\n\"There's a real opportunity here in terms of increasing the diversity of the health care workforce to have positive impacts in people's interactions in the health care system,\" Artiga says.\n\nThe survey was conducted in the summer of 2023 and is the first in a series of studies KFF plans to do on the effects of racism and discrimination.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Gavin McIntyre for KFF Health News hide caption\n\nKINGSTREE, S.C. - One morning in late April, a small brick health clinic along the Thurgood Marshall Highway bustled with patients.\n\nThere was Joshua McCray, 69, a public bus driver who, four years after catching COVID-19, still is too weak to drive.\n\nLouvenia McKinney, 77, arrived complaining about shortness of breath.\n\nPonzella McClary brought her 83-year-old mother-in-law, Lula, who has memory issues and had recently taken a fall.\n\nMorris Brown, the family practice physician who owns the clinic, rotated through Black patients nearly every 20 minutes. Some struggled to walk. Others pulled oxygen tanks. And most carried three pill bottles or more for various chronic ailments.\n\nBut Brown called them \"lucky,\" with enough health insurance or money to see a doctor. The clinic serves patients along the infamous \"Corridor of Shame,\" a rural stretch of South Carolina with some of the worst health outcomes in the nation.\n\n\"There is a lot of hopelessness here,\" Brown said. \"I was trained to keep people healthy, but like 80% of the people don't come see the doctor, because they can't afford it. They're just dying off.\"\n\nAbout 50 miles from the sandy beaches and golf courses along the coastline of this racially divided state, Morris' independent practice serves the predominantly Black town of roughly 3,200 people. The area has stark health care provider shortages and high rates of chronic disease, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease.\n\nSuch racial inequities are especially severe across the Southeast, home to most of the country's Black population.\n\nBut South Carolina remains one of the few states where lawmakers refuse to expand Medicaid, despite research that shows it would provide medical insurance to hundreds of thousands of people and create thousands of health care jobs across the state.\n\nThe decision means there will be more preventable deaths in the 17 poverty-stricken counties along Interstate 95 that comprise the Corridor of Shame, Brown said.\n\n\"There is a disconnect between policymakers and real people,\" he said. The African Americans who make up most of the town's population \"are not the people in power.\"\n\nThe U.S. health care system, \"by its very design, delivers different outcomes for different populations,\" said a June report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. Those racial and ethnic inequities \"also contribute to millions of premature deaths, resulting in loss of years of life and economic productivity.\"\n\nOver a recent two-decade span, mounting research shows, the United States has made almost no progress in eliminating racial disparities in key health indicators, even as political and public health leaders vowed to do so.\n\nAnd that's not an accident, according to academic researchers, doctors, politicians, community leaders, and dozens of other people KFF Health News interviewed.\n\nFederal, state, and local governments, they said, have put systems in place that maintain the status quo and leave the well-being of Black people at the mercy of powerful business and political interests.\n\nJoshua McCray, of Kingstree, South Carolina, retired as a public bus driver after he caught COVID and nearly died. During the pandemic, Black Americans were more likely to hold jobs - in fields such as transportation, health care, law enforcement, and food preparation - that the government deemed essential to the functioning of society, making them more susceptible to the virus. Gavin McIntyre for KFF Health News hide caption\n\nAcross the nation, authorities have permitted nearly 80% of all municipal solid waste incinerators - linked to lung cancer, high blood pressure, higher risk of miscarriages and stillbirths, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma - to be built in Black, Latinx, and low-income communities, according to a complaint filed with the federal government against the state of Florida.\n\nFederal lawmakers slowed investing in public housing as people of color moved in, leaving homes with mold, vermin, and other health hazards.\n\nAnd Louisiana and other states passed laws allowing the carrying of concealed firearms without a permit even though gun violence is now the No. 1 killer of kids and teens. Research shows Black youth ages 1 to 17 are 18 times more likely to suffer a gun homicide than their white counterparts.\n\n\"People are literally dying because of policy decisions in the South,\" said Bakari Sellers, a Democratic former state representative in South Carolina.\n\nKFF Health News undertook a yearlong examination of how government decisions undermine Black health - reviewing court and inspection records and government reports, and interviewing dozens of academic researchers, doctors, politicians, community leaders, grieving moms, and patients.\n\nFrom the cradle to the grave, Black Americans suffer worse health outcomes than white people. They endure greater exposure to toxic industrial pollution, dangerously dilapidated housing, gun violence, and other social conditions linked to higher incidence of cancer, asthma, chronic stress, maternal and infant mortality, and myriad other health problems. They die at younger ages, and COVID shortened lives even more .\n\nDisparities in American health care mean Black people have less access to quality medical care, researchers say. They are less likely to have health insurance and, when they seek medical attention, they report widespread incidents of discrimination by health care providers, a KFF survey shows. Even tools meant to help detect health problems may systematically fail people of color.\n\nAll signs pointed to systems rooted in the nation's painful racist history, which even today affects all facets of American life.\n\n\"So much of what we see is the long tail of slavery and Jim Crow,\" said Andrea Ducas , vice president of health policy at the Center for American Progress, a nonprofit think tank.\n\nPut simply, said Jameta Nicole Barlow , a community health psychologist and professor at George Washington University, government actions send a clear message to Black people: \"Who are you to ask for health care?\"\n\nThe end of slavery gave way to laws that denied Black people in the U.S. basic rights, enforced racial segregation, and subjected them to horrific violence.\n\n\"I can take facts from 100 years ago about segregation and lynchings for a county and I can predict the poverty rate and life expectancy with extraordinary precision,\" said Luke Shaefer , a professor of social justice and public policy at the University of Michigan.\n\nStarting in the 1930s, the federal government sorted neighborhoods in 239 cities and deemed redlined areas - typically home to Black people, Jews, immigrants, and poor white people - unfit for mortgage lending. That process concentrated Black people in neighborhoods prone to discrimination.\n\nLocal governments steered power plants, oil refineries , and other industrial facilities to Black neighborhoods, even as research linked them to increased risks of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, cancer, and preterm births.\n\nMorris Brown, a primary care physician, says that South Carolina lawmakers' refusal to expand Medicaid will result in preventable deaths because many people who live near his medical offices in Kingstree and Lake City cannot afford to go to a doctor. (Gavin McIntyre for KFF Health News) Gavin McIntyre for KFF Health News hide caption\n\nThe federal government did not even begin to track racial disparities in health care until the 1980s, and at that time disparities in heart disease, infant mortality, cancer, and other major categories accounted for about 60,000 excess deaths among Black people each year. Elevated rates of six diseases, including cancer, addiction, and diabetes, accounted for more than 80% of the excess mortality for Black and other minority populations, according to \" The Heckler Report ,\" released in 1985. During the past two decades there have been 1.63 million excess deaths among Black Americans relative to white Americans. That represents a loss of more than 80 million years of life, according to a 2023 JAMA study .\n\nRecent efforts to address health disparities have run headlong into racist policies still entrenched in health systems. The design of the U.S. health care system and structural barriers have led to persistent health inequities that cost more than a million lives and billions of dollars, according to the National Academies report.\n\n\"When COVID was first hitting, it was just sort of immediately clear who was going to suffer the most,\" Ducas said, \"not just because of differential access to care, but who was in a living environment that's multigenerational or crowded, who is more likely to be in a job where they are an essential worker, who is going to be more reliant on public transportation.\"\n\nFor example, in spring 2020, the North Carolina health department, led by current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Mandy Cohen, failed to get COVID testing to vulnerable Black communities where people were getting sick and dying from COVID-related causes at far higher rates than white people.\n\nAnd Black Americans were far more likely to hold jobs - in areas such as transportation, health care, law enforcement, and food preparation - that the government deemed essential to the economy and functioning of society, making them more susceptible to COVID, according to research .\n\nUntil Joshua McCray, the bus driver in Kingstree, S.C., got COVID in his mid-60s, he was strong enough to hold two jobs. He ended up on a feeding tube and a ventilator after he contracted COVID in 2020 while taking other essential workers from this predominantly Black area to jobs in a whiter, wealthier tourist town.\n\nNow he cannot work and at times has difficulty walking.\n\n\"I can tell you the truth now: It was only the Good Lord that saved him,\" said Brown, the rural physician who treated McCray and many patients like him.\n\nFederal and state governments have spent billions of dollars to implement the Affordable Care Act, the Children's Health Insurance Program, and other measures to increase access to health care. Yet, experts said, many of the problems identified in \"The Heckler Report\" persist.\n\nWhen Lakeisha Preston in Mississippi was diagnosed with walking pneumonia in 2019, she ended up with a $4,500 medical bill she couldn't pay. Preston works at Maximus, which has a $6.6 billion contract with the federal government to help people sign up for Medicare and Affordable Care Act health plans.\n\nShe is convinced that being a Black woman made her challenges more likely.\n\n\"Think about how many centuries the same thing has been happening,\" said Preston, noting how her mother worked two jobs her entire life without a vacation and suffered from health conditions including diabetes, cataracts, and carpal tunnel syndrome. Today Preston can't afford to put her 8-year-old son on her health plan, so he's covered by Medicaid.\n\nIn email exchanges with the Biden administration, spokespeople insisted that it is making progress in closing the racial health gap. They said officials have taken steps to address food insecurity, housing instability, pollution, and other social determinants of health that help fuel disparities.\n\nPresident Joe Biden issued an executive order on his first full day in office in 2021 that said \"the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed and exacerbated severe and pervasive health and social inequities in America.\" Later that year, the White House issued another executive order focused on improving racial equity and acknowledged that long-standing racial disparities in health care and other areas have been \"at times facilitated by the federal government.\"\n\n\"The Biden-Harris Administration is laser focused on addressing the health needs of Black Americans by dismantling persistent structural inequities,\" said Renata Miller, a spokesperson for the administration.\n\nThe CDC, along with some state and local governments , declared racism a serious public health threat.\n\nU.S. Rep. Alma Adams, a North Carolina Democrat, pushed for \"Momnibus\" legislation to reduce maternal mortality. Yet federal lawmakers left money for Black maternal health out of the historic Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.\n\n\"I come to this space as an elected official, knowing what it is like to be poor, knowing what it is like to not have insurance and having to get up at 3, 4 in the morning with my mom to take my sister to the emergency room,\" Adams said.\n\nIn the 1960s in North Carolina, Adams and her family would take her sister Linda, who had sickle cell anemia, to the emergency room because they had no doctor and could not afford health insurance. Linda died at the age of 26 in 1971.\n\n\"You have to have some sensitivity for this work,\" Adams said. \"And a lot of folks that I've worked with don't have it.\"\n\nDr. Morris Brown's medical practice serves the predominantly Black town of Kingstree, S.C. (population roughly 3,200). The area has stark health care provider shortages and high rates of chronic disease, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease. Gavin McIntyre for KFF Health News hide caption\n\nThe website for Kingstree depicts idyllic images of small-town life, with white people sitting on a porch swing, kayaking on a river, eating ice cream, and strolling with their dogs. Two children wearing masks are the only Black people in the video, even though Black people make up 70% of the town's population.\n\nBut life in Kingstree and surrounding communities is marked by poverty, a lack of access to health care, and other socioeconomic disadvantages that have given South Carolina poor rankings in key health indicators such as rates of death and obesity among children and teens.\n\nSome 23% of residents in Williamsburg County, which contains Kingstree, live below the poverty line, about twice the national average, according to federal data.\n\nThere is one primary care physician for every 5,080 residents in Williamsburg County. That's far less than in more urbanized and wealthier counties in the state such as Richland , Greenville , and Beaufort .\n\nEdward Simmer, the state's interim public health director , said that if \"you are African American in a rural zone, it is like having two strikes against you.\"\n\nAsked if South Carolina should expand Medicaid, Simmer said the challenges South Carolina and other states confront are worsened by health care provider shortages and structural inequities too large and complicated for Medicaid expansion alone to solve.\n\n\"It is not a panacea,\" he said.\n\nBut for Brown and others, the reason South Carolina remains one of the few states that have not expanded Medicaid - one step that could help narrow disparities with little cost to the state - is clear.\n\n\"Every year we look at the data, we see the health disparities and we don't have a plan to improve,\" Brown said. \"It has become institutionalized. I call it institutional racism.\"\n\nA July report from George Washington University found that Medicaid expansion would provide insurance to 360,000 people and add 18,000 jobs in the health care sector in South Carolina.\n\n\"Racism is the reason we don't have Medicaid expansion. Full stop,\" said Janice Probst, a former director of the Rural and Minority Health Research Center in South Carolina. \"These are not accidents. There is an idea that you can stay in power by using racism.\"\n\nSouth Carolina's Republican governor, Henry McMaster, in July vetoed legislation that would have created a committee to consider Medicaid expansion, saying he did not believe it would be \"fiscally responsible.\"\n\nExpanding Medicaid in the state could result in $4 billion in additional economic output from an influx of federal funds in 2026, according to the July report.\n\nBeyond health care coverage and provider shortages, Black people \"have never been given the conditions needed to thrive,\" said Barlow, the George Washington University professor. \"And this is because of white supremacy.\"\n\nKFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF .\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Here's why\n\nBy\n\nBria Suggs\n\nParticipants speak during an event June 26 at Rocky's Barber Shop in Atlanta, hosted by the Donald Trump campaign and billed as a \"Black American Business Leaders Round Table,\" in advance of a presidential debate between President Biden and Trump. From left are lobbyist Rufus Montgomery, radio host Shelley Wynter, Rep. Wesley Hunt, R-Texas, Marc KD Boyd, founder of Helping Empower Youth, Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., Rocky Jones, barbershop owner, Ben Carson, former secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and Latron Price, manager of Westside Community Market. Gerald Herbert/AP hide caption\n\nJen Iro, a 34-year-old from Texas, has been having a hard time with the current state of American politics. The last time she cast a ballot was for former President Barack Obama, and she doesn't think she'll vote this year either.\n\n\"[Politics are] not really important to me because as of right now, it seems to get worse and worse and worse, which really makes me more disinterested,\" Iro explained.\n\nIro is one of a growing number of young eligible voters who are feeling disconnected from politics and unable to identify with a political party. With a lack of affordable housing, climate change and rising costs, some millennials and Gen Zers are feeling hopeless about a political system that they don't believe has been catering to their needs.\n\nGenerally, young voters and Black voters tend to vote Democratic. In 2020, 92% of Black voters cast a vote for President Biden, while only 8% backed former President Donald Trump.\n\nHowever, there appears to be a shift within the Black electorate that has been widening over the years. According to Pew Research , 7% of Black voters over 50 currently identify as or lean Republican, while 17% of Black voters under 50 align with the Republican Party. It is unclear how Vice President Harris, as the Democrats' presidential hopeful, will fare with this group.\n\nA member of the audience cheers as President Biden speaks during a campaign rally at Girard College on May 29 in Philadelphia. Biden has since dropped out of the race in favor of Vice President Harris and this event launched a nationwide campaign to court Black voters, a group that has traditionally come out in favor of Biden, but their support projected lower for him than it was in 2020. Harris' stake with the group is yet to be seen. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images hide caption\n\nPeople tend to grow more conservative as they age. But among Black voters, younger generations may be the more conservative ones. In a pivotal election year, this conservative shift could have an impact on the upcoming presidential election.\n\nApproximately 40 million members of Gen Z will be eligible to vote in November. Of that 40 million, almost half are young people of color, including nearly 6 million Black youth.\n\nChristopher Towler is investigating why Iro and other young Black voters feel disconnected from politics. He's an associate professor at California State University, Sacramento and the principal investigator of the Black Voter Project.\n\n\"[Black voters] know the importance of elections,\" Towler said. \"They understand what it means to have representation. But at the same time, they don't necessarily feel like they're being represented by either side of the aisle right now.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nTowler thinks that a lot of Black Americans who are less likely to vote, or vote less consistently, aren't seeing what politicians and parties claim as \"wins\" for the Black community impact their individual lives. People may not see more opportunities for themselves, as are often touted by the Biden Administration, including lowering Black unemployment or increasing Black small business loans and grants.\n\n\"I think there's an overall sentiment that they want something to support, they really understand the importance of this moment,\" Towler said. \"But at the same time, they're not necessarily sure that their vote is going to change much.\"\n\nAs part of the Black Voter Project's 2024 national survey , Towler examined the level of Republican support among young voters.\n\n\"In the data that I collected, the highest percentage of Black people that say they're going to vote for Trump is among the 18- to 29-year-old cohort, with about 22% saying they'll vote for Trump,\" Towler explained. \"They're also the least supportive of the Democratic Party.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nTowler thinks this partially could stem from young people thinking of the Civil Rights Movement as distant history.\n\n\"We're getting into generations of young Black voters that are not just once removed, but maybe twice or three times removed from a civil rights generation,\" Towler said. \"The way that they form their identity is less likely to be directly attached to the civil rights struggle...they're less likely to be suspicious of political institutions and they're more likely to support Trump and the Republicans.\"\n\nBernard Fraga, associate professor at Emory University, has also noticed this shift. To Fraga, this is simply a new era of Black voters.\n\n\"The narrative that the Democrats kind of own the change issue, as in the idea that people who want things to be different than they are now, that's been something that's been true for a long time,\" Fraga said. \"Now, there's some folks in the electorate, particularly young people, who see the Republican Party as representing change.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nR.C. Maxwell, a 35-year-old Republican from Arizona, has witnessed a lot of change within the party over the years. He doesn't remember seeing much conservative outreach to young voters or voters of color before Donald Trump ran for president in 2015. Now, Maxwell says, the party is speaking directly to those groups.\n\nHe's also noticed more young people gravitate toward the GOP as they seek economic opportunities.\n\n\"We want prosperity and we want secure borders and we want the American dream,\" Maxwell said. \"And only the Republican Party is speaking to this message because they have the policies in terms of limited government. Drill, baby, drill . \"\n\nKiah Hopkins is a 20-year-old from Georgia who plans on voting for the Democratic ticket in November, but knows people her age who are Republican-leaning or looking at a third-party candidate.\n\n\"The thing that I hear a lot is, if a person is really conservative, they really like how the economics are handled by Republicans,\" Hopkins said. \"Usually with social issues, they tend to be more liberal. At least, like, my friends who maybe are in the middle or leaning conservative, they'll be more liberal on social issues and more conservative with economics.\"\n\nShe says she has heard a lot of her peers say they aren't planning to vote in the presidential election, and it concerns her.\n\n\"For people who say they're outright not voting just scares me because this is a privilege that we have, that our ancestors were able to fight for,\" Hopkins said.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

A little more than 6 in 10 Black voters say they feel \"hopeful\" about the state of the country. More than 8 in 10 Black voters say they feel \"exhausted.\"\n\n\"I think that if anywhere you find just how heterogeneous Black Americans are, it's around this question of patriotism,\" said Farah Jasmine Griffin, the chair of the African American and African Diaspora Studies Department at Columbia University. \"You have African Americans who are definitely patriotic, but not uncritically so, not naively so. And then you have others who find a problem with the very notion of patriotism, and I think that's always been an ongoing and consistent tension.\"\n\nWe broached this topic in a series of conversations with more than a dozen Black people across the country from various backgrounds.

Military background, serving your country was really important. And the sacrifices that soldiers made was really emphasized,\" she said. \"And then, on the other hand, we would talk about, like, the civil rights movement. But the two never combined.\"\n\nShe wasn't the only person to draw a link between patriotism and the struggle for civil rights. Armond Bragg of Birmingham, Ala., did, too. The 75-year-old was active in the civil rights movement during the 1960s.\n\nWhen asked how he saw patriotism, Bragg described himself as \"from the school of Colin Kaepernick,\" the former quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers who sparked a movement when he knelt during the national anthem to protest police brutality .\n\n\"I believe in kneeling on one knee to protest what's going on in this country,\" Bragg said.\n\nAs he's watched protests continue, Bragg has wondered how much has changed.\n\n\"You know, there's not a better song to listen to than the national anthem. It can at times give you goose bumps. But knowing what's happening in the country, we don't have these patriotic desires as we used to have, even when we were dealing with segregation,\" he said.\n\nIn Richmond, Va., where the Confederate statues on Monument Avenue have been a focal point for demonstrations , Maya Rogers described the beauty of the scene.\n\n\"One day we were walking somewhere that had nothing to do with the protests, but it literally stopped us, the beauty of everyone being together and singing, and standing around the monument drew us in,\" Rogers, 23, said. \"Me personally, I've felt so many emotions because I feel like I'm walking in ancestors' shoes in Richmond.\"\n\nShe said that protesting made her feel like \"a true American,\" because she was \"fighting for something she wanted to stand up for.\"\n\nMadea Neyor's parents are from Liberia and she grew up in the U.S. That gives her a dual perspective on patriotism.

That's given her the chance to have conversations with family that grew up in Liberia.\n\n\"I've visited Liberia several times, being that both of my parents are from there, while growing up in the United States. I do see what it's like and what it can do to a country when people are at unrest,\" she said. \"One of the great things about growing up here in the United States is getting that dual perspective.\"\n\nWhen asked how she thought about patriotism today, Neyor connected it to what she'd learned from her parents..\n\n\"I took it as, what can I do to help a country, a place that I love, be better,\" she said. \"Those are values of leadership that I think both my parents instilled in me, of being prideful of a country while assisting it and helping it to be better, too.\"\n\nMany people, including Andre Myrick in Charlottesville, Va., described the challenge of feeling attachment to this country, where progress has been both halting and uneven.\n\nWhen asked about his experience learning about patriotism, Myrick brought up his father who is a Marine Corps veteran. He said his father cared a lot about service, but as time went on \"even he felt less and less patriotic about patriotism, generally.\"\n\nMyrick said this is one of the first times in his life that he's been finding his voice as it relates to issues of his own race.\n\n\"I've been going back and listening to civil rights leaders and just passionate black voices from the past. I was listening to a program with James Baldwin a couple of weeks ago, and he talks about speaking with a 16-year-old Black boy in San Francisco who feels like he doesn't have a country,\" said Myrick. \"And Baldwin basically says, 'I have nothing to say that proves that he does.' That kind of sums up how I've been feeling of late.\"\n\nAndre Myrick of Charlottesville, Va., was one of the many people who described the challenge of feeling attachment to this country, where progress has been both halting and uneven. Andre Myrick hide caption\n\nAndre Myrick of Charlottesville, Va., was one of the many people who described the challenge of feeling attachment to this country, where progress has been both halting and uneven.\n\nThe Rev. Frantz Whitfield of Waterloo, Iowa, has also struggled with this challenge. When he first began decorating his office at Mount Carmel Missionary Baptist Church, he hung a copy of the Declaration of Independence on the wall.  Several years later, he took it down and replaced it with a Nelson Mandela campaign poster.\n\nWhitfield, who is 38, said that when people ask why the campaign poster remains on his wall, he tells them that it's because, while Nelson Mandela stood up for his rights, Whitfield's country hasn't stood up for his.\n\n\"As a black man, I really don't take much pride in the independence of a country where I feel that in the year 2020, I have to talk about banning choke holds and police reform, all these years later,\" he said. \"I really feel like that's something that should have been done years ago. I celebrate the history of my culture, my ancestors who sacrificed so much for me to have a somewhat comfortable life.\"\n\nInstead of celebrating the Fourth of July, Whitfield said he thinks about July 5, the day in 1852 when Frederick Douglass delivered a speech in which he said: \"This Fourth of July is yours, not mine. You may rejoice, I must mourn.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Not the figurative kind, but a literal dream, as she slept in the rental studio apartment in South Los Angeles that she was sharing with a friend.\n\nAt around 2 a.m., Norrington remembers, \"God said to me, 'Why don't you get a mortgage that doesn't move?' And in my head I knew that meant a fixed mortgage.\"\n\nDonnaLee Norrington in her bedroom in Compton, Calif. Last summer, as she slept in a  rental studio apartment in South Los Angeles, she had a dream about owning a home for the first time. Norrington was 59 at the time.

Last summer, as she slept in a  rental studio apartment in South Los Angeles, she had a dream about owning a home for the first time. Norrington was 59 at the time.\n\nThe very next morning - she made an appointment with Mark Alston, a local mortgage broker well known in the South LA Black community, to inquire about purchasing her very own home for the first time.\n\nShe was 59 at the time.\n\nAlston has built his lending practice on the hope of expanding access to homeownership for Black Americans. He says they have been systematically discriminated against by the real estate industry and government policy. Unlike most loan officers, Alston works with his clients for months - even years - to disentangle a convoluted loan application process, pay off bills and boost credit scores so they can ultimately qualify for a home loan.\n\nToday, Norrington and her younger sister MaryJosephine Norrington own a three-bedroom house in Compton, where three generations of her family currently live.\n\nDonnaLee Norrington in her living room with grandchildren.

Norrington and her younger sister MaryJosephine Norrington own a three-bedroom house in Compton, where three generations of her family currently live.\n\nOwning a home is an undeniable part of the American dream - and of American citizenship. It is also the key to building intergenerational wealth. But Norrington's homeownership success story is an increasingly rare one for Black Americans.\n\nOver the last 15 years , Black homeownership has declined more dramatically than for any other racial or ethnic group in the United States. In 2019, the Black homeownership rate was about as low as in the 1960s , when private race-based discrimination was legal.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe story of housing discrimination is rooted in a long history of racist government policies perpetuated by the real estate industry and private attitudes that began with slavery. The federal government began to push and expand homeownership in the New Deal era through innovations like the 30-year mortgage.\n\nBut one way Black people and other minority groups were left out systematically was through a process known as \"redlining\" which labeled certain areas as \"risky\" for a home loan. African Americans and immigrants were relegated to areas, marked in red on government-sponsored maps , where poverty was most concentrated and housing was deteriorating.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe Fair Housing Act of 1968 recognized segregationist practices like redlining to be unconstitutional. But the law only prohibited future, formalized discrimination rather than undoing the foundationally racist landscape on which homeownership in America was built.\n\nThe vicious cycle and legacy of redlining has persisted: Residents of redlined communities struggled to receive loans to buy or renovate their homes, which led to disrepair and a decline of a community's housing stock. That in turn forced businesses to close and depressed tax revenue, diminishing school funding.\n\n\"The market is a reflection of that which we hold to be valuable - that which we see as desirable, that which we see as undesirable. And it's impossible to measure that without factoring in race in the United States,\" says writer Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor .\n\nToday, many of the same neighborhoods that were redlined continue not only to have the highest poverty rates, but also worse health outcomes that lead to shorter lifespans. And Black Americans are nearly five times more likely to own a home in a formerly redlined neighborhood than in a greenlined, or \"desirable,\" neighborhood, resulting in less home equity than white Americans have.\n\nThe West Coast has often held hope as a cultural and political promised land for marginalized groups. During the first and second Great Migrations, millions of Black Americans moved west to escape the Jim Crow South in search of more equal treatment and opportunities - in part, because legal, racist policies and practices were so widespread all across the country at that time.\n\nBut while Los Angeles, one of California's major metropolises, would become the battleground for hard-fought civil rights victories for Black Americans, it was also a place where housing segregation, predatory real estate practices and exploitative lending thrived.\n\nOur story begins with one Los Angeles neighborhood, known as Sugar Hill, where the Black community successfully fought racially restrictive covenants only to later face another threat - from the freeway.\n\nThe tree-lined boulevards of the West Adams neighborhood are studded with stately homes.\n\n\"That was Marvin Gaye's place right there,\" says Rha Nickerson, who grew up in the area, as she points to one such two-story house on Gramercy Place.\n\nIt's easy to tell from the ornate architecture of the houses, the antique street lights and the wide roads that the neighborhood bore witness to a lot of history. But it's hard to miss the loud hum of the Santa Monica I-10 freeway coming from behind a large concrete wall at the end of Marvin Gaye's street.\n\nSiblings Rha and Van Nickerson are now 73 and 72, respectively. They spent formative years of their childhoods in this neighborhood, which was once called Sugar Hill - a nod to the thriving Black Harlem Renaissance neighborhood of the same name. Doctors, entrepreneurs and oil barons lived in Sugar Hill - even legendary stars like jazz singer Ethel Waters and Gone with the Wind actress Hattie McDaniel.\n\nBut Sugar Hill's thriving Black community was an exception: It managed to exist despite systemic efforts to prevent Black people from buying homes in much of Los Angeles.\n\nSiblings Rha (left) and Van Nickerson are now 73 and 72, respectively. They spent the formative years of their childhoods in the neighborhood of Sugar Hill. Nevil Jackson for NPR hide caption\n\nOne of the most prevalent tools white residents used to maintain the segregation - across America and in Sugar Hill - was the racially restrictive covenant . These agreements, embedded in property deeds, made homeowners promise never to sell to African Americans or other minority groups. In 1940, 80% of properties in Los Angeles had these restrictions attached to them.\n\nRha Nickerson remembers her father teaching her about these covenants when she was a young girl, and says that it was only because people like Hattie McDaniel fought these restrictions that her family was able to live there.\n\nRacially restrictive covenants were ubiquitous in Sugar Hill at the time, like many places in America. But some white homeowners willingly violated them to sell to Black buyers, in part because Black people were willing to pay more since there was far less property available to them. The willingness to violate covenants was especially the case around the Great Depression, when many homeowners were desperate to sell.\n\nIvan Houston stands outside the historic Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company while sharing the history of his grandfather's company. Nevil Jackson for NPR hide caption\n\nThe first African American known to purchase a home in Sugar Hill was entrepreneur Norman Houston, who bought property in 1938. In the years following, a wave of Black families moved into the area.\n\nBut one white homeowners association did not like the way its neighborhood was changing. So members of the West Adams Heights Improvement Association sued their Black neighbors for violating racially restrictive covenants in hopes of having them evicted - even though white sellers had violated the covenants.\n\nLeft: Ivan Abbott Houston (bottom left), with his father Ivan J.

Two of Houston's grandchildren, Ivan Houston and Kathi Houston-Berryman, say they remember their grandfather as a leader in the movement for housing justice for Black Angelenos.\n\n\"He always did have a vision and I think he was what is known as a pacesetter ... because he was always moving ahead,\" Houston-Berryman says.

Hattie McDaniel, her codefendants, and 250 sympathizers \"appeared in all their finery and elegance.\"\n\nThe white plaintiffs claimed Black homeowners in Sugar Hill would lead to declining property values in the neighborhood, even though their Black neighbors had well-maintained properties with increasing home values. Such racist thinking was in line with the dominant logic of the real estate industry at the time - the logic underlying redlining.\n\nIn his retort, civil rights attorney Loren Miller, who represented the Black homeowners, used an argument that had never worked in any U.S. court before - that restrictive covenants violated the California Constitution and the 14th Amendment, which mandates equal protection under the law.\n\nOutside the former home of their grandfather, Norman Houston, Ivan Houston and Kathi Houston-Berryman speak with a current resident who points next door to where Gone with the Wind actress Hattie McDaniel once lived. Nevil Jackson for NPR hide caption\n\nTaking the packed courtroom by surprise, Judge Thurmond Clarke ruled in favor of Miller. \"Certainly there was no discrimination against the Negro race when it came to calling upon its members to die on the battlefields in defense of this country in the war just ended,\" Clarke said.\n\nThis victory did not just mean the Black residents of Sugar Hill got to stay in their homes - it set a precedent for the 1948 U.S. Supreme Court Case Shelley v. Kraemer , also argued by Miller, that would deem racially restrictive covenants unenforceable.\n\nThe neighborhood of West Adams, formerly know as Sugar Hill. Then neighborhood was split in two by the construction of the Santa Monica Freeway in early 1960s. Nevil Jackson for NPR hide caption\n\nAmina Hassan, who has written a biography about Miller, says the win was monumental because \"housing was the crux of it all.\" She says access to safe, quality housing meant Black people could \"have their children in better schools, they could find jobs in the area. Housing was the key to greater wealth.\"\n\nIn 1952, a few years after the Supreme Court ruling, Rha and Van Nickerson's family moved into the Berkeley Square community of Sugar Hill. The siblings' eyes light up recounting their childhood there.\n\n\"We got our wagon and we'd go up and down the street and selling lemonades,\" Van recalls. They share a laugh and Rha adds, \"We learned how to drive in Berkeley Square because the streets, there was no traffic. It was so comfortable then.\"\n\nSanta Monica I-10 freeway now occupies the space where the historic neighborhood of Berkeley Square once stood. Nevil Jackson for NPR hide caption\n\nBut just months after the Nickersons moved in, rumors began to spread that yet another threat to Sugar Hill was looming - a freeway. It was part of a federal push in the 1950s to modernize America's roadways, and many of these highways ultimately cut through communities of color. The proposed plans called for the Santa Monica Freeway to run east to west, razing Berkeley Square completely and splitting Sugar Hill in two.\n\n\"I remember quite vividly and I remember my father being so upset. ...I remember meetings with homeowners in Berkeley Square,\" Rha Nickerson says. Some of those homeowners banded together and lobbied against the freeway at the state Capitol.\n\nBut this time, all they were able to accomplish was delaying the project. The California Highway Commission unanimously approved the freeway that would decimate Rha and Van Nickerson's childhood home. Van remembers looking outside of his bedroom window. \"I watched the tractor bulldoze these homes down.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nThe government seized the Nickersons' home through eminent domain - and while the U.S. Constitution requires \"just compensation\" for any property acquired this way, residents who lost their homes were not entitled to assistance from the government in finding and moving to new homes.\n\nRha Nickerson felt her family was cheated. \"I remember my father telling me about eminent domain, and how there was no option to stop this. The valuation for our home was quite low; it was not market value that we were compensated for. And so it was quite an upheaval.\"\n\nThe Nickerson house at 20 Berkeley Square as seen in the mid-1950s. Van Nickerson hide caption\n\nIt was an upheaval Rha's father told her would never have happened if Sugar Hill were a white neighborhood. \"He was very, very angry. He felt the city government resented Black people living there, and this is their way of demolishing a very viable community to support racism,\" she says.\n\nAt the time, highway planners used the language of science to justify building freeways through communities of color, says Eric Avila, a professor of urban studies at UCLA. \"They presented a kind of dizzying array of charts and graphs to insist that this was the most economically efficient route for this particular freeway. They denied any questions of race, they denied any questions of bias.\"\n\nIn the neighborhood of West Adams, a culdesac sits against the interstate 10 freeway. Nevil Jackson for NPR hide caption\n\nWhat they did instead, Avila says, was say they were targeting so-called \"blighted\" communities. \"I don't think we know the extent to which Sugar Hill was designated a blighted area because it was affluent. ... But in the discourse of urban planning in the mid-20th century in the United States, blight was often synonymous with people of color and with African Americans in particular.\"\n\nBy 1963, the construction through Sugar Hill began and Rha and Van Nickerson's family home was replaced with traffic lanes. Around that time, the California Division of Highways proposed another freeway that would cut through Beverly Hills. But when that wealthy white community protested, officials canceled construction.\n\nAlmost 70 years later, the Nickersons still feel the loss of their childhood home. \"It was just sad,\" Rha Nickerson says. \"I didn't know what to expect because that's all I knew was Berkeley Square, and I really felt very secure in the community. So I was quite rattled by it all.\" She and her brother say that after the freeway forced them out, they never quite experienced the same safety and comfort that Sugar Hill provided.\n\nRha and Van Nickerson are dressed for Easter in their backyard in Berkeley Square in the mid-1950s. Van Nickerson hide caption\n\nVan Nickerson recalls a particular moment when he knew things had changed. \"We moved over onto Bronson Avenue and I immediately got into some problems. Most of that neighborhood was white and a white boy called me a n***** in front of my house. And pardon my vernacular, but I kicked his ass. You know, that was the beginning of the real world for us.\"\n\nFor many of the residents in the area today, deafening road noise, toxic pollutants, and the resulting health conditions they cause are part of everyday life. This pattern has played out in cities all across America - affecting communities of color most.\n\nBefore Van and Rha Nickerson parted ways during a recent visit to their old neighborhood, they closed their eyes and listened for the sounds of their beloved Berkeley Square one more time - only for Van to hear \"the rumbling of the automobile.\"\n\n\"That was nonexistent when we were kids. It was quiet,\" he said. Rha nodded in agreement, adding, \"You can't hear the birds anymore.\" She headed to the corner to catch the next bus to Inglewood, where she lives now.\n\nVan got into his car to begin his journey home to a town more than an hour away. His drive would begin on the Santa Monica Freeway - and take him right through the middle of what was once known as Sugar Hill.\n\nAs the construction that made Los Angeles \"the city of freeways\" ramped up in the early 1960s, white Americans continued to move to newly developed suburbs that dotted the borders of urban city centers.\n\nIt had been nearly a decade since racially restrictive covenants had been lifted, so slowly, more neighborhoods were opening up to Black residents like Robert Lee Johnson's family.\n\nJohnson and his two brothers lived in a public housing complex in South LA until his mother Gaynelle became an X-ray technician and married his stepfather, James Ferguson, who was an aerospace engineer. In 1961, they bought property from a white couple just north of downtown Compton, a suburb just south of downtown Los Angeles.\n\nJohnson remembers moving-in day. \"I see moving vans, trucks and everything all down the street,\" he says. Johnson was 5 years old at the time, so he says he thought \"it was moving day for everybody.\" And he noticed that all the other families moving in were were Black, too.\n\nIn the years before covenants had been deemed unconstitutional, Compton was a nearly all-white city. Suddenly, when covenants were lifted, the real estate industry recognized a new, untapped market could be targeted for home sales.\n\nRobert Lee Johnson in his old neighborhood in Compton. Johnson remembers moving in one day in 1961. \"I see moving vans, trucks and everything all down the street,\" he says. Johnson was 5 years old at the time, so he says he thought \"it was moving day for everybody.\" And he noticed that all the other families moving in were were Black, too.

Johnson was 5 years old at the time, so he says he thought \"it was moving day for everybody.\" And he noticed that all the other families moving in were were Black, too.\n\nBut for Black people to move in, existing homeowners would have to make way. So, the real estate industry targeted white homeowners to convince them to sell their homes using a scheme known as blockbusting.\n\nThe underlying idea was to create panic among white homebuyers by creating the expectation that Black homebuyers were moving in and would, in turn, lower property values in their neighborhoods. There are accounts of real estate agents recruiting Black people to walk around white neighborhoods with strollers to create the impression that African American families were settling in.\n\nAgents would convince white homeowners that their houses were losing value by the day because of the looming threat of Black neighbors, so the homeowners would panic and sell. Then, the agents would turn around and sell those homes at inflated prices to Black buyers - who were eager to make a start in better neighborhoods.\n\nKitty Felde, who is white, grew up in Compton in the 1960s and remembers a flyer appearing under her family's front door. \"It had one very clear message and it was, 'Sell now, because you're never going to be able to get the money you want for your house.' And they didn't say this but it was like, they are moving in.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nFelde says it was clear the flyers were referring to African Americans. In the years to come, she began noticing the neighborhood changing and new faces at school. Her family chose to stay, but many white neighbors fled and families like Robert Johnson's took their place.\n\nJohnson has warm memories of the years that followed \"moving day\" in 1961. He says Compton felt like a \"step into another world\" compared with the public housing complex his family was living in prior to their move. Though their new home was shared with his brothers, it was spacious. He recalls having fruit trees in his backyard - oranges, loquats and persimmons. \"I didn't know what a loquat was until I got to Compton!\"\n\nHe remembers going to a local recreation center and park to learn how to swim, play basketball and perform in community Christmas plays. \"Our parents were involved, you know. Your father was out there being a coach, the mothers were out there supporting the team, selling hot dogs.\" He says it was a typical American suburb.\n\nUntil the mid-1960s, Compton was a thriving Black city with Black political power - it had elected its first Black councilman, Douglas Dollarhide, who eventually went on to become the city's first Black mayor. Union jobs were opening up to Black workers, and Compton was home to better, integrated schools and a city college.\n\nBut while Compton represented social mobility for many Black Americans, it also came to represent their exploitation. Predatory practices, like blockbusting, forced families to overpay for homes that would eventually decline in value as more Black residents arrived. According to census data, the median home price in Compton in 1960 was $12,800. Johnson's family paid $17,500 - or 37% more - despite it being a smaller home than most in Compton at the time.\n\nRobert Lee Johnson speaks with a resident in his childhood neighborhood. He says Compton felt like a \"step into another world\" compared with the public housing complex his family was living in prior to their move. Though their new home was shared with his brothers, it was spacious. Nevil Jackson for NPR hide caption\n\nJosh Sides, a professor of history at California State University, Northridge, says those numbers strongly suggest Johnson's family was a target of blockbusting. And after more Black residents moved in, home prices languished in Compton over the next several generations.\n\n\"The really evil part of blockbusting, in my view, is that it perpetuated the notion that Black people in your neighborhood diminished value,\" Sides says. \"And because of that perception, it became a self-fulfilling prophecy. That is, it became true that a Black person moving to your neighborhood meant your value declined because, of course, property values are largely the function of social decision and social beliefs.\"\n\nBy 1970, Compton's Black population had reached 71%. But as more white residents left, their businesses and tax base did, too. A number of economic factors also led to fewer manufacturing jobs in the area, which were the backbone of Compton's steady employment. Around this time, industrial jobs had largely moved to LA's suburbs, unemployment in Compton was skyrocketing, and it continued to worsen into the next decade.\n\nJohnson remembers some neighbors began having trouble making their mortgage payments. \"The first time I really noticed it personally was at school because you're sitting in class and your classmates are gone,\" he says.\n\nThat's when he recognized something had changed. Wilson Park, where he had had taken swim lessons and played basketball, was suddenly without paid adult supervision, which Johnson remembers resulting from a loss in the city's revenue.\n\n\"People in Compton were put in a very bad position,\" he says. \"Legitimate jobs were gone, and then comes this - it's more than a drug. It was almost like a demonic spirit.\" He is referring to the crack epidemic that took hold in Compton during the 1980s.\n\nNearly three decades after his family had purchased his childhood home in Compton, Johnson realized he didn't want to raise his own son in his beloved city.\n\nRobert Lee Johnson greets his childhood friend and neighbor, Yolanda Segura. The two met in 1961 when Robert first moved to the neighborhood at age 5. Nevil Jackson for NPR hide caption\n\n\"One day, I'm sitting in front of my house washing my car, and some fool from a block away had gotten a new rifle and he starts shooting out the street lights.\" To protect his son, Johnson felt he had no option but to leave Compton.\n\nWhen Johnson's family sold their home in 1988 for $64,000, it was worth less than what they paid in 1961. Adjusted for inflation, that house lost nearly 8% of its value over 27 years.\n\nBut even though Johnson left Compton, Compton never really left him. He's written a book about the city's history, he's a founding member of the city's historical society, and you can see his face brighten instantly when he spots an old neighbor during a recent visit.\n\nRobert Johnson was just one of thousands of Black Comptonites who began streaming out of the city in the 1980s in search of more space and safer neighborhoods. The face of the once majority Black city was changing quickly as its African American residents largely moved inland to newly built exurbs.\n\nBilly Ross remembers visiting his relatives in newly developed cities like Rancho Cucamonga. \"None of this existed. ... These houses were built like '06, '07, '08.\" By the early 2000s, so many people from Compton had relocated to the Inland Empire that one of its neighborhoods became known as \"Little Compton.\" Nevil Jackson for NPR hide caption\n\nBilly Ross, now 45, spent the 1980s and early '90s growing up in Compton just as Johnson was relocating his family. \"Compton was changing around us - and fast,\" Ross says.\n\nHe describes his childhood there as both \"magical\" and \"incredibly challenging.\" Magical because it was a largely Black city with political power, which meant there was diversity within the Black community. \"It was a spectrum of people, a spectrum of Black class ... you know, from professional people to people [that] are just getting by. I mean, that's magical.\"\n\nRoss' eyes crinkle and a smile spreads across his face when he recalls sitting on his front porch as his sister would braid his hair and a neighbor would walk past, making spontaneous plans to play a game of dice around the corner. He says there was always something exciting happening on his block. But then his smile fades. \"The Compton I grew up in really doesn't exist anymore.\"\n\nBut the \"incredibly challenging\" part of growing up in Compton, he says, came when the crack epidemic and its ripple effects hit. Economic inequality and police violence against Black people in Los Angeles were at a fever pitch. The rising tension between law enforcement and African Americans erupted in the 1992 uprising when four police officers were acquitted after brutally beating a Black man named Rodney King.\n\nBilly Ross explains the development happening in Rancho Cucamonga. He says people are moving away from the architecture of McMansions and towards something more modern. Nevil Jackson for NPR hide caption\n\nRoss' relatives and neighbors began trickling out of the city in search of more space, good schools, and safety. It was also becoming increasingly unaffordable to purchase property in Los Angeles County. Like many others, Ross' relatives turned their gazes to the Inland Empire - a stretch of land that began about 50 miles east of LA. Not long before, it had been mostly desert, vineyards and factories.\n\nBut then, a window of opportunity opened for potential Black homebuyers when newly developed cities like Rancho Cucamonga cropped up. Ross remembers visiting his relatives nearby. \"None of this existed. ... These houses were built like '06, '07, '08.\" By the early 2000s, so many from Compton had relocated to the Inland Empire that one of its neighborhoods became known as \"Little Compton.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nRoss recalls his impression of life in the Inland Empire as a teenager. \"It's like, 'You guys are going to buy a five-bedroom house and you're going to have a pool. Like what? That's super fly ... and people were willing to commute for that.\" Even though housing was cheaper and more spacious in the Inland Empire, most jobs stayed in LA, which meant commuters spent anywhere from three to five hours in rush-hour traffic per day.\n\nRoss' parents chose to stay in Compton. Their philosophy was, \"don't move, improve.\" That's a phrase Ross says Black people hear a lot. \"In the places where we are en masse, there is often an incentive to leave, and that's messed up because you don't get the generational, the institutional, cultural insulation. You don't get the transfer of energy. And you end up going from where you are rich in so many ways - maybe not financial - but you're rich. And you go elsewhere looking to carve out some economic security. But culturally, now you are diluted.\"\n\nBut even for Ross, who holds such allegiance to Compton, moving inland eventually became the most practical option. In 2000, after he had graduated college, he married his wife, Tamara, who rented a home, and then they briefly owned a condominium 25 miles northeast of Compton. A few years later, when they learned they were expecting their first child, they decided they needed more space and had new considerations, like good school districts.\n\nSo, in April 2006, the couple zeroed in on a four-bedroom house with a three-car garage in the city of Fontana in the Inland Empire. The entire lot was almost 8,000 square feet. It would cost $525,000.\n\nTheir loan officer offered them terms they could not refuse - something commonly known as a NINJA loan . They would have a minimal down payment - far lower than the standard 20% - and they would need no proof of income or assets. All the officer needed was a credit check, which was no problem for the couple because they had high credit scores. It was so easy, and they had been told they could always refinance if they needed a more affordable payment later down the line.\n\n\"There was this kind of feel that this is a secret and it's being brought to the masses now. That was even part of the pitch. ... You remember this feeling like, 'Oh, yeah, this is like the kind of loan white people use.' You know, like, 'Why would you use your own money to buy a house?' \"\n\nA neighborhood of Rancho Cucamonga, a city in the Inland Empire. As it became increasingly unaffordable to purchase property in Los Angeles County, like many others, Ross' relatives turned their gazes to the Inland Empire - a stretch of land that began about 50 miles east of LA. Not long before, it had been mostly desert, vineyards and factories. Nevil Jackson for NPR hide caption\n\nImmediately, Ross threw himself into the pleasures of suburban life. \"The newness of it was cool. This was a one-story house and it had space inside and outside. And I could water my own grass like my father did. I had grass !\" Ross was transitioning into a real estate career at this time, Tamara was climbing the ranks as a prosecutor, and they were growing their family. Life in Fontana was good.\n\n\"And then, by the fall of '07, all hell broke loose,\" Ross says. The global financial crisis struck and suddenly, the oasis that was the Inland Empire was beginning to disappear before his eyes. Nearly 16% of homes in the region went into foreclosure, making it one of the hardest hit places in the country.\n\nMany homeowners in the area sought help from the Fair Housing Council of Riverside County, where Rose Mayes is the executive director. \"I had to create a whole new [foreclosure] department\" because of the high demand for this kind of help, she says. The phone calls from those seeking help were incessant. \"They were experiencing pain,\" Mayes says. \"They didn't know what to do. ... people who thought they had done the right thing for the right reasons and it didn't happen that way.\"\n\nMany people Mayes remembers helping were buying homes or refinancing for the first time, making them more vulnerable to the predatory, subprime loans that were widespread during this time. And she noticed that Black and Latinx people were most commonly targeted for such loans.\n\nThis is a pattern that has now been tracked all over the United States. Several studies have found that Black and Latinx borrowers were charged significantly more for mortgage loans than white borrowers with similar financial situations between 2004 and 2008.\n\nA financial innovation called \" mortgage-securitization \" incentivized investors to sell as many loans as possible. Lenders would often steer homebuyers who could have qualified for conventional government mortgages into riskier loans that put more money in the lenders' pockets - telling buyers they could have a bigger house, lower payments, or both.\n\nThe people who were disproportionately targeted belonged to the same communities that had been redlined, locked out of neighborhoods because of racially restrictive covenants, and blockbusted. Now, predatory loans would take away the wealth that so many had spent their lifetimes building.\n\nRose Mayes is the executive director of the Fair Housing Council of Riverside County. Mayes remembers helping first-time homebuyers who were vulnerable to predatory subprime loans. Nevil Jackson for NPR hide caption\n\nBy 2008, Ross says his house was worth half of what he paid for it two years earlier. But his mortgage payments didn't reflect that decreased value. He and his wife were paying two times what neighbors were paying to rent the homes along his street - many of them homes that had been foreclosed on by banks.\n\nHomeownership did not shape up to be what Ross once thought - a promise to pass on wealth and security to his children.\n\nRoss says he tried to refinance time and time again because what he was paying was becoming unsustainable. But the lenders refused - because ironically, as long as he kept paying his mortgage every month, they had no incentive to cut him a better deal. He thought, \" 'Oh, I know this game,' and that was tough because you have made a commitment ... and the commitment is tied, in a way, to your identity. You see yourself as a certain type of person.\"\n\nBut after paying what he says felt like an exorbitant mortgage for several years, \"Tamara and I ultimately decided that these people don't give a damn about us. And they are content to bleed us dry.\"\n\nSo they stopped paying. Ross knew their credit scores would tank and they would have to swallow that hit for years to come. But he also knew this strategy was the only chance they had to hold on to their house.\n\nEventually, about two years after they employed a \"strategic default,\" Billy and Tamara Ross' gamble worked. A lender finally agreed to help them refinance. They spent years building up their credit score again. In 2019, they were able to sell the house in Fontana and move into a new one nearby.\n\nMayes, of the Fair Housing Council, says many homeowners in the Inland Empire are still reeling from the financial crisis. Others she remembers helping simply disappeared, she says.\n\nBilly Ross considers himself one of the lucky few Black people who made it out of financial hole, despite a system he thinks is designed to keep African Americans on the bottom. \"It really makes me sad,\" he says. \"There ain't a whole lot of us on this side where we're able to function and kind of take advantage of some of the things that this society has to offer.\" Nevil Jackson for NPR hide caption\n\nBilly Ross considers himself one of the lucky few Black people who made it out, despite a system he thinks is designed to keep African Americans on the bottom.\n\n\"It really makes me sad,\" he says. \"There ain't a whole lot of us on this side where we're able to function and kind of take advantage of some of the things that this society has to offer. A lot of us, we don't own property. We don't have equity in the stock market. We don't have equity in this country. We don't own stuff. And ownership is equity.\"\n\nThat is why Ross isn't wasting his second chance. He and his wife have been building what Ross calls his soon-to-be \"forever home.\" He recalls a recent conversation with a loan officer who was trying to lock him into a loan now - promising that if he didn't like the terms, he could \"just refinance\" down the road.\n\nIt was all too familiar to Ross, who thought, \" 'This guy's asking me to gamble.' And I told him ... 'Dude, I'm Black. ... We're going to measure twice and cut once. And we're probably going to keep this house forever, whether we live in it or not. It's going to belong to our children.' \"\n\nFor Ross, passing on that property is not just about leaving behind a house for his kids. It's about passing the baton to the next generation, and the one after that - so that one day, they have something to call their own.\n\nA few months ago, DonnaLee Norrington celebrated her 60th birthday in the newly purchased Compton home she and her sister, MaryJosephine, now call their own. Norrington thought she would never own a home again after losing the condominium she and her ex-husband briefly owned before the financial crisis. She said losing that home had turned her credit upside down and from that point on, she rented.\n\nDonnaLee Norrington thought she would never own a home again after losing the condominium she and her ex-husband briefly owned before the financial crisis. Norrington is seen here with her sister, MaryJosephine, in her home office. Nevil Jackson for NPR hide caption\n\n\"I didn't even consider homeownership just because I thought it was out of my grasp - not so much financially, but just the fact that maybe I was too old to own a home and I just didn't want all the responsibility that came with it,\" Norrington says.\n\nThen, she had that dream in which God told her to go to Mark Alston, the mortgage broker, to buy a home with a fixed mortgage. Alston says he understood Norrington's vision, but \"she started crying before we closed. I told her to wait. Let's get all the way done before we celebrate.\"\n\nAlston says he got into real estate because he wanted to do something for his community - for people like Norrington - to change the persistent gap between Black and white homeownership. \"I mean, it's pretty unbelievable to me [that] almost 75% of the white community owns houses. ... And in my community, you know, it's like 2 out of every 10 in LA, 4 out of every 10 in the country,\" he says.\n\nDonnaLee Norrington and her sister MaryJosephine. While they did qualify for decent loans with their existing credit situations, a little bit of guidance in paying off bills and waiting for negative portions of their credit history to expire helped them get a better rate, and eventually, qualify for a refinance. Nevil Jackson for NPR hide caption\n\nAlston has mostly Black clients in and around LA. He says there are complex, systemic barriers holding Black Americans back from homeownership, many of them tied to the process of acquiring an affordable loan that actually allows them to retain and pass on generational wealth.\n\nIn order to simply qualify for a loan, a potential borrower must be favorably \"creditworthy\" according to the lender. In the existing financial system, it is the FICO credit score that primarily determines that creditworthiness, but a third of Black Americans do not even have one.\n\nAnd for those who do, Alston says, the scores are not as fair or predictive as they could be because the score does not factor in a wide range of payments ordinary people pay. For example, cellphone bills, utility bills and even rental payments are not included in the FICO scores lenders typically use.\n\nMany financial experts agree that these kinds of payments are good indicators of one's ability to pay a monthly mortgage. Laurie Goodman of the Urban Institute told NPR, \"I would assume that if you are looking at my credit score, whether or not I make rental payments is far more predictive than whether or not I pay my Macy's credit card - but my Macy's credit card is included and rental payments are not.\"\n\nDonnaLee Norrington embraces her daughter Summer at her home. Nevil Jackson for NPR hide caption\n\nAlston says, in the case of DonnaLee Norrington and her sister, while they did qualify for decent loans with their existing credit situations, a little bit of guidance in paying off bills and waiting for negative portions of their credit history to expire helped them get a better rate, and eventually, qualify for a refinance. \"A lot of people have disputes with credit over a $200 or $300 cable box bill,\" which he says could significantly lower credit score.\n\nNot all mortgage brokers help their clients dig through paperwork and small disputes to get a better loan. But Alston says most Americans lack an understanding of a complex financial system, so this kind of guidance goes a long way. \"It has nothing to do with intelligence. It has to do with familiarity with financial operations,\" he says.\n\nMark Alston has built his lending practice on the hope of expanding access to homeownership for Black Americans. He says they have been systematically discriminated against by the real estate industry and government policy. Nevil Jackson for NPR hide caption\n\nBeyond credit scoring, an additional barrier to homeownership became more prevalent after the financial crisis - risk-based pricing, which essentially means the riskier the borrower, the more a lender charges that borrower to loan them money.\n\nAbout half of Black homebuyers get loans backed by the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which primarily use a borrower's credit score and down payment to measure the risk that will determine the cost of the loan. Because the average Black borrower's credit score is about 60 points lower than the average white borrower's score, and because Black buyers, on average, make smaller down payments, risk-based pricing tends to drive up costs for the average Black homebuyer.\n\nPrior to the global financial crisis, Fannie and Freddie used risk-based pricing to a limited degree, but they generally enabled a broad spectrum of borrowers to access fairly similar rates on their loans. But in response to the crisis, the mortgage giants got more aggressive with risk-based pricing - which disparately affects borrowers with less wealth and lower credit scores. Alston calls this \"the poor-pay-more fee.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nEconomist Ed Golding worked at Freddie Mac during the crisis. Now at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he has analyzed how these extra charges affect Black homeowners' wealth. \"It's inherently unfair that basically we raised the prices during the financial crisis so that these people who were hurt by the financial crisis could bail out the financial institutions,\" he says.\n\nGolding says homebuyers with less wealth and lower credit scores are still being asked to pay more today. \"It seems that we're asking the victims to pay and to pay again for what was really not their fault,\" he says.\n\nIn separate statements to NPR, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac said this type of pricing helps them manage risk, and has \"provided stability during the pandemic and enabled homeownership for millions of families, including many families of color.\"\n\nA third barrier to homeownership that disproportionately affects Black borrowers is mortgage insurance, which is typically required if a borrower makes a down payment that is less than 20% of the loan amount. In fact, 9 in 10 Black homebuyers pay for mortgage insurance compared to only 6 in 10 white homebuyers. And insurance is just another way the financial system accounts for risk - the cost of which is passed on to the \"risky\" homebuyer.\n\nThe Fair Housing Act does not consider any of these risk-based barriers to be illegal. Until now, courts have ruled that lenders can price loans in ways that disproportionately disadvantage certain racial groups if that pricing is related to credit risk. But researchers at UC Berkeley have been exploring a fourth barrier that has nothing to do with credit risk: outright discrimination.\n\nThe researchers analyzed nearly 10 million home loans and found that Black and Latinx borrowers are still being charged more, even after controlling for risk. That means Black and Latinx homebuyers with the same credit score and percent down payment as white homebuyers are still paying more for their loans, despite posing no additional risk to the lender - which amounts to illegal discrimination, based on past court rulings.\n\nUntil the mid-1960s, Compton was a thriving Black city with Black political power - it had elected its first Black councilman, Douglas Dollarhide, who eventually went on to become the city's first Black mayor. Union jobs were opening up to Black workers, and Compton was home to better, integrated schools and a city college. Nevil Jackson for NPR hide caption\n\nThe study also found that the higher the concentration of Black or Latinx residents in a neighborhood, the more Black or brown buyers in that neighborhood are overcharged.\n\n\"This effect is much more pronounced when we cut by geography,\" says Robert Bartlett of Berkeley Law, one of the authors of the study. \"And so, it is a legitimate concern that basically, this is kind of the new redlining that we're faced with.\"\n\nIn this case, rather than refusing to insure loans in Black and brown neighborhoods, lenders simply appear to be charging marginally higher rates to people who live in those neighborhoods. And the effect holds true even when computer algorithms are writing the loans. Their findings will appear in a forthcoming issue of the Journal of Financial Economics .\n\nThis idea, of including Black Americans in the housing market but charging them more to do so, is part of what Princeton scholar Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor calls \"predatory inclusion.\"\n\n\"Once you pay this fee, that fee, this higher amount of money, now you get to participate equally with your white peers,\" Taylor says. \"And so not only does that impact the way that housing is supposed to generate wealth for people - it cuts into the wealth, the amount of money African Americans have to pay to enter into the housing market in the first place.\"\n\nMark Alston meets with clients at his office on La Tijera Boulevard in Los Angeles. Unlike most loan officers, Alston works with his clients for months â even years â to disentangle a convoluted loan application process, pay off bills and boost credit scores so they can ultimately qualify for a home loan.

Unlike most loan officers, Alston works with his clients for months â even years â to disentangle a convoluted loan application process, pay off bills and boost credit scores so they can ultimately qualify for a home loan.\n\nThe cumulative effects of these legal policies and discriminatory practices mean Black Americans pay more to own a home - what some experts call a \"Black tax\" on homeownership. It also means they accumulate less wealth over their lifetimes than white Americans - on the order of tens of thousands of dollars of lost savings and investments, according to an analysis by MIT's Golding and his colleagues.\n\nAnd while lenders and mortgage companies may say risk-based pricing is a fair way to account for risk, the broker Mark Alston has a different view of what \"fair\" means in America. \"When you've had 350 years of not just unfairness but actual opposition - you had exclusionary zoning laws, you had private covenants, you had federally institutionalized redlining, now you have disparate housing finance policy. When you have actual opposition, 'fair' is an interesting concept.\"\n\nAlston says \"a good head start beats fast running,\" and worries that a 350-year head start for white Americans could mean Black Americans may never catch up - unless the financial system is changed to be more affirmatively equitable.\n\n\"I could care less about Black Lives Matter being painted on [a] basketball court,\" he says. \"How about an affirmative program to lower the gap between white and black homeownership? How about actual public policy that moves the needle, for real? How about a change in employment and pay that narrows the gap, the inequities between white and black pay? How about those type of things that will make a difference for future generations?\"\n\nIn a statement to NPR, the National Association of Realtors, the largest real estate group in the country, acknowledged its past role in housing discrimination and said it has implemented anti-bias training programs for its members.\n\nBack on her tree-lined street in Compton, DonnaLee Norrington sheds tears through a big smile as she reflects on her accomplishment. \"I always feel like a late bloomer,\" she says, but owning her own home is a relief.

Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nThough African Americans are being hospitalized for COVID-19 at more than triple the rate of white Americans, wariness of the new vaccine is higher in the Black population than in most communities. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention highlighted communities of color as a \"critical population\" to vaccinate. But ProPublica found little in the way of concrete action to make sure that happens.\n\nIt will be up to states to make sure residents get the vaccine, but ProPublica reviewed the distribution plans of the nine states with the most Black residents and found that many have barely invested in overcoming historic mistrust of the medical establishment and high levels of vaccine hesitancy in the Black community. Few states could articulate specific measures they are taking to address the vaccine skepticism.\n\nAnd it could be hard to track which populations are getting the vaccine. While the CDC has asked states to report the race and ethnicity of every recipient, along with other demographic information like age and sex, the agency doesn't appear ready to apply any downward pressure to ensure that such information will be collected.\n\nIn state vaccination registries, race and ethnicity fields are simply considered \"nice to have,\" explained Mitchel Rothholz, chief of governance and state affiliates for the American Pharmacists Association. While other fields are mandatory, such as the patient's contact information and date of birth, leaving race and ethnicity blank \"won't keep a provider from submitting the data if they don't have it.\"\n\nIn the initial stages, vaccines will go to people who are easy to find, like health care workers and nursing home residents. But barriers will increase when distribution moves to the next tier - which includes essential workers, a far larger and more amorphous group. Instead of bringing the vaccine to them, it's more likely that workers will have to seek out the vaccine, so hesitancy and lack of access will become important factors in who gets the shots and who misses out.\n\n\"There are individuals who are required to be on the front line to serve in their jobs but perhaps don't have equitable access to health care services or have insurance but it's a challenge to access care,\" said Dr. Grace Lee, a professor of pediatrics at Stanford University School of Medicine and member of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which is tasked with issuing guidance on the prioritization of COVID-19 vaccine distribution. \"We can build equity into our recommendations, but implementation is where the rubber meets the road.\"\n\nAbout a quarter of the public feels hesitant about a COVID-19 vaccine, meaning they probably or definitely would not get it, according to a December poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Hesitancy was higher than average among Black adults in the survey, with 35% saying that they definitely or probably would not get vaccinated.\n\nMistrust of the medical community among people of color is well-founded, stemming from a history of unscrupulous medical experimentation. The infamous Tuskegee study, conducted from 1932 to 1972 by the U.S. Public Health Service, still looms large in the memories of many Black Americans, who remember how researchers knowingly withheld treatment from African American sharecroppers with syphilis in order to study the disease's progression.\n\nSubscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\nBut the injustices aren't confined to the past. The National Academies' Institute of Medicine has found that minorities tend to receive lower-quality health care than white counterparts, even when adjusting for age, income, insurance and severity of condition. Black Americans are also more likely to be uninsured and utilize primary care services less often than white Americans.\n\n\"It's not just about history. It's about the here and now,\" said Dr. Bisola Ojikutu, an infectious disease physician at Massachusetts General Hospital. \"People point to racial injustice across the system. It's not just hospitals; people don't trust the government, or they ask about the pharmaceutical industry's profit motive. From the very beginning, Black and brown people are marginalized from the enterprise of research. They think: 'So few people look like us in research, industry and academia, why should we trust that someone at that table is thinking of our interest?'\"\n\nWhen it comes to vaccinations, the consequences can be grave. Black and Hispanic people are less likely to get the flu shot than white people, according to the CDC. At the same time, Black Americans have the highest rate of flu-associated hospitalizations, at 68 people per 100,000 population, compared to 38 people per 100,000 in the non-Hispanic white population.\n\nHealth officials have tried to assuage vaccine concerns in the traditional way, by publicizing specific individuals receiving the shot. The U.S. began its mass immunization effort by injecting a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine into the left upper-arm of Sandra Lindsay, a Black woman and critical care nurse in New York.\n\nMeanwhile, an onslaught of memes and conspiracy theories characterizing the vaccine as harmful are making the rounds on social media. One reads, \"Just had the covid-19 vaccine. Feeling great,\" along with the picture of the character from the 1980 movie \"The Elephant Man.\" Another image circulating on Twitter features the photos of three Black people and claims they are suffering from Bell's palsy due to the vaccine. The Twitter user who shared the image asked followers, \"still want those Tuskegee 2.0 genocide vaccines?\"\n\nIt may only take one or two negative headlines to further sow fear, said Komal Patel, who has 16 years of experience as a pharmacist in California. After two health care workers in the United Kingdom experienced allergic reactions to Pfizer's vaccine, Patel said she saw anxiety spike on social media, even though regulators have said that only people with a history of anaphylaxis - a severe or life threatening immune reaction - to ingredients in the vaccine need to avoid taking the shot. \"Just two patients, and here we go, there's all this chatter.\"\n\nIt falls to states to make sure their residents of color are vaccinated. But the speed at which the vaccine needs to be disseminated means that states haven't had much time to plan communications efforts, said Lee, from CDC's advisory group. \"How do we make sure messaging is appropriate? You may want to emphasize different messages for different communities. We don't have the time for that.\"\n\nProPublica found that few states can articulate specifically what they are doing to address vaccine skepticism in the Black community.\n\nTexas , Georgia and Illinois' state plans make no mention of how they plan to reach and reassure their Black residents. Black communities make up between 13% and 33% of the population in the three states, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. None of the three states' health departments responded to requests for comment.\n\nCalifornia's state plan includes \"a public information campaign ... to support vaccine confidence,\" but does not provide details apart from the state's intention to use social media, broadcast outlets and word of mouth. In an email, the California Department of Public Health did not provide additional information about outreach to Black residents, only saying, \"this is an important issue we continue to work on.\"\n\nA spokesman for New York's Department of Public Health said the state has been working since September to overcome hesitancy with expert panels and events like Gov. Andrew Cuomo's November meeting with community leaders in Harlem to discuss concerns with the Trump administration's vaccine plan, specifically for communities of color.\n\n\"Governor Cuomo has been leading the national effort to ensure...black, brown and underserved communities have equal access to, and confidence in, the vaccine,\" a Saturday statement said.\n\nDr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said: \"Media outreach is not enough. TV ads are one thing, but usually public service announcements are at midnight when nobody is listening, because that's when they're free.\" Normally, public health officials go to barber shops, beauty salons, bowling alleys and other popular locales to hand out flyers and answer questions, but due to the pandemic and limits on congregating, that's not an option, Benjamin said, so officials need to plan a serious social media strategy. That could involve partnering with \"influencers\" like sports figures and music stars by having them interview public health figures, Benjamin suggested.\n\nDr. Mark Kittleson, chair of the Department of Public Health at New York Medical College, said he's not surprised to hear how vague some of the state health plans are, because states often focus on providing high-level guidance while county or regional level health departments are left to execute the plan. But he said specific efforts need to be undertaken to reach residents of color. \"Spokespeople for the vaccination need to be a diverse group,\" Kittleson said. \"Dr. Tony Fauci is fantastic, but every state needs to find the leading health care experts that represent the diversity in their own state, whether it's Native American, African American or Latino.\" Kittleson also suggested partnering with churches.\"Especially in the African American community, when the minister stands up and says, 'Folks, you need to take your blood pressure medication and take care of yourself,' people listen to that,\" he said. \"The church needs to be brought into the fold.\"\n\nMaryland's state plan acknowledges the distrust among Black and Latino communities as well as rural residents, and says it will aim to tailor communication to each group by working with trusted community partners and representatives of vulnerable groups. A Department of Health spokesperson said in an email that \"as vaccination distribution continues to ramp up, we urge all individuals to get the vaccine.\"\n\nFlorida's written plan includes a messaging strategy for everyone in the state, but does not specifically address the Black community. A \"thorough vaccination communication plan continues to be developed in order to combat vaccine hesitancy,\" a spokesperson for the Florida Department of Health said in response to ProPublica's queries.\n\nIn North Carolina and Virginia, however, health officials started preparing months ago to reassure residents about potential vaccines. North Carolina formed a committee in May with leaders from marginalized communities to guide the state's overall response to the pandemic. Vaccine concerns were a priority, said Benjamin Money, deputy secretary of health services for North Carolina's Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe politicization of the pandemic has mobilized the Black and brown medical scientific community to dig into the research and how the vaccines work, Money said, \"so that they can feel assured that the vaccine's safe and it's effective and they can convey the message to their patients and to their community constituents.\"\n\nThe development and deployment of a vaccine will affect everybody on the planet. Help us identify and tell important stories.\n\nThe committee is advising North Carolina officials on their vaccine messaging and hosting a webinar for Black religious leaders. Similarly, the Virginia Department of Health has staff devoted to health equity across racial and ethnic groups and is putting on a series of town hall-style meetings speaking to specific communities of color.\n\nBlack residents in Virginia have expressed concerns about how rapidly the early vaccines were developed, said Dr. Norman Oliver, Virginia's state health commissioner.\n\n\"It all boils down to telling people the truth,\" Oliver said. \"The first thing to let folks know is that one of the reasons why these vaccines were developed so quickly is because of the advances in technology since the last time we did vaccines; we're not trying to grow live virus and keep it under control or do attenuated virus and develop a vaccine this way.\"\n\nIn addition to promoting reliable information, Virginia health officials hired a company to monitor the spread of vaccine misinformation in the state and to locate where falsehoods appear to be taking hold, Oliver said. The state hopes to target its communications in places where distrust is most intense.\n\nThe CDC has set aside $6.5 million to support 10 national organizations, according to spokesperson Kristen Nordlund. The funds are \"to be disbursed by each organization to their affiliates and chapters across the country so they may do immunization-focused community engagement in the local communities they serve,\" Nordlund said in an email. She didn't respond to questions on whether the funds had already been disbursed and to which organizations.\n\nEvery state has a vaccination registry, where data on administered shots is routinely reported, from childhood vaccinations to the flu shot. What's new in this pandemic is that the CDC has requested all the data be funneled up to the federal level, so it can track vaccination progress across the nation.\n\n\"Race and ethnicity data should be recorded in states' immunization data, but we do not know how reliably it is collected,\" said Mary Beth Kurilo, senior director of health informatics at the American Immunization Registry Association. \"We really don't have good data on how well it's captured out there across the country.\"\n\nMany immunization records are fed into the state's registry directly from a doctor's electronic health record system, Kurilo said, which can present technological stumbling blocks: \"Is [the data] routinely captured as part of the registration process? Can they capture multiple races, which I think is something that's become increasingly important going forward?\"\n\nWhen asked about historic rates of compliance and how they planned to gather information on race and ethnicity of vaccine recipients this time, health departments from Georgia, Texas, Illinois, Florida and California didn't respond.\n\nMaryland's state plans indicate it intends to use information gathered through its vaccine appointment scheduling system, including demographic data gathered from recipients, to direct its communication outreach efforts. The Maryland Department of Health, which didn't provide more detailed information, said it is \"currently exploring all options as far as vaccine data reporting.\"\n\nNorth Carolina's immunization records system routinely collects race and ethnicity information, and a spokesperson told ProPublica it has that type of demographic data for 71% of people in the system. Stephanie Wheawill, director of pharmacy services at the Virginia Department of Health, said that providers will be \"asked to record that information\" but didn't elaborate on how the department planned to encourage or enforce compliance.\n\nData fields for vaccine recipients' race and ethnicity are standard in New York, a spokesman said. But the state didn't provide any details about rates of compliance in supplying that data.\n\n\"You've got to have the data to compare,\" said Martha Dawson, president of the National Black Nurses Association and an associate professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham's nursing school. \"Because if you don't have the data, then we're just guessing. There's no way to know who received it if you don't take the data.\"\n\nThere is tension between gathering enough data to understand the extent of the rollout and the possibility that asking for too much information will scare away people who are already leery of the vaccine.\n\n\"The biggest concern people have is how will this information be used?\" said Lee, from the CDC's advisory group. \"People need to trust that the data will be used with a good intent. \"\n\nRothholz, with the American Pharmacists Association, said there could be ways apart from state registries to estimate vaccine uptake among minorities. \"If I'm a community pharmacy in a predominantly African American community, if I'm giving away 900 or 1000 vaccines, you can track penetration that way,\" he said. Geographic-based analysis, however, would depend on the shots being distributed via community pharmacies rather than by mass vaccination sites - a less likely scenario for the Pfizer vaccine, the first to be administered, which requires ultracold storage that will be difficult for many small pharmacies to manage.\n\nThe best way to help a worried individual, whether scared about data collection or the vaccine itself, is a conversation with a trusted caregiver, according to Dr. Susan Bailey, president of the American Medical Association.\n\n\"Time and again it's been shown that one of the most valuable things to encourage a patient to undertake a change, whether it's stopping smoking or losing weight, is a one-on-one conversation with a trusted caregiver - having your physician saying, 'I took it and I really want you to take it too,\" she said. \"But patients have to have the opportunity to ask questions, and not to be blown off or belittled or feel troublesome for asking all their questions.\"\n\n\"If someone says that they're afraid of being a guinea pig, maybe drill a bit deeper,\" Bailey suggested. \"Ask, 'What are you concerned about? Are you concerned about side effects? Are you concerned that not enough people have taken it?'\"\n\nThe American Academy of Family Physicians uses the mnemonic \"ACT\" to guide their members in conversations with patients of color, president Dr. Ada Stewart said in an email: \"Be Accountable and Acknowledge both historical and contemporary transgressions against Black, brown and Indigenous communities. ... Communicate safety, efficacy and harms such that individuals can weigh their own personal risk to potential benefits, and exercise Transparency with regard to the development of vaccines and the distribution process.\"\n\nDavid Hodge, associate director of education at Tuskegee University's National Center for Bioethics in Research and Health Care, urges Black and brown leaders such as pastors and community organizers to take control of the messaging right now and not wait for their local governments to tackle the issue.\n\n\"We're not in a position right now to be patient. We're not in a position to sit on the sidelines, we have to make it happen.\"\n\nUpdate, Dec. 19, 2020: This story was updated with a statement from the New York Department of Public Health.\n\nFiled under:\n\nCaroline Chen\n\nCaroline Chen was a national reporter for ProPublica covering health care.\n\nRyan Gabrielson\n\nRyan Gabrielson was a reporter for ProPublica covering health care.\n\nTopher Sanders\n\nI report on injustice of any kind, but particularly in race, inequality and the legal system.\n\nGet our investigations delivered to your inbox with the Big Story newsletter.\n\nCreative Commons License (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0)\n\nThank you for your interest in republishing this story.

It made perfect sense to ProPublica's Nikole Hannah-Jones.\n\nby Nikole Hannah-Jones\n\nInvestigating America's racial divide in education, housing and beyond.\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nThis story was co-published with Politico Magazine .\n\nLast July 4, my family and I went to Long Island to celebrate the holiday with a friend and her family. After eating some barbecue, a group of us decided to take a walk along the ocean. The mood on the beach that day was festive. Music from a nearby party pulsed through the haze of sizzling meat. Lovers strolled hand in hand. Giggling children chased each other along the boardwalk.\n\nMost of the foot traffic was heading in one direction, but then two teenage girls came toward us, moving stiffly against the flow, both of them looking nervously to their right. \"He's got a gun,\" one of them said in a low voice.\n\nI turned my gaze to follow theirs, and was clasping my 4-year-old daughter's hand when a young man extended his arm and fired off multiple shots along the busy street running parallel to the boardwalk. Snatching my daughter up into my arms, I joined the throng of screaming revelers running away from the gunfire and toward the water.\n\nThe shots stopped as quickly as they had started. The man disappeared between some buildings. Chest heaving, hands shaking, I tried to calm my crying daughter, while my husband, friends and I all looked at one another in breathless disbelief. I turned to check on Hunter, a high school intern from Oregon who was staying with my family for a few weeks, but she was on the phone.\n\n\"Someone was just shooting on the beach,\" she said, between gulps of air, to the person on the line.\n\nUnable to imagine whom she would be calling at that moment, I asked her, somewhat indignantly, if she couldn't have waited until we got to safety before calling her mom.\n\n\"No,\" she said. \"I am talking to the police.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\nMy friends and I locked eyes in stunned silence. Between the four adults, we hold six degrees. Three of us are journalists. And not one of us had thought to call the police. We had not even considered it.\n\nWe also are all black. And without realizing it, in that moment, each of us had made a set of calculations, an instantaneous weighing of the pros and cons.\n\nAs far as we could tell, no one had been hurt. The shooter was long gone, and we had seen the back of him for only a second or two. On the other hand, calling the police posed considerable risks. It carried the very real possibility of inviting disrespect, even physical harm. We had seen witnesses treated like suspects, and knew how quickly black people calling the police for help could wind up cuffed in the back of a squad car. Some of us knew of black professionals who'd had guns drawn on them for no reason.\n\nThis was before Michael Brown . Before police killed John Crawford III for carrying a BB gun in a Wal-Mart or shot down 12-year-old Tamir Rice in a Cleveland park. Before Akai Gurley was killed by an officer while walking in a dark staircase and before Eric Garner was choked to death upon suspicion of selling \"loosies.\" Without yet knowing those names, we all could go down a list of unarmed black people killed by law enforcement.\n\nWe feared what could happen if police came rushing into a group of people who, by virtue of our skin color, might be mistaken for suspects.\n\nFor those of you reading this who may not be black, or perhaps Latino, this is my chance to tell you that a substantial portion of your fellow citizens in the United States of America have little expectation of being treated fairly by the law or receiving justice. It's possible this will come as a surprise to you. But to a very real extent, you have grown up in a different country than I have.\n\nAs Khalil Gibran Muhammad, author of The Condemnation of Blackness , puts it, \"White people, by and large, do not know what it is like to be occupied by a police force. They don't understand it because it is not the type of policing they experience. Because they are treated like individuals, they believe that if 'I am not breaking the law, I will never be abused.'\"\n\nWe are not criminals because we are black. Nor are we somehow the only people in America who don't want to live in safe neighborhoods. Yet many of us cannot fundamentally trust the people who are charged with keeping us and our communities safe.\n\nAs protest and revolt swept across the Missouri suburb of Ferguson and demonstrators staged die-ins and blocked highways and boulevards from Oakland to New York with chants of \"Black lives matter,\" many white Americans seemed shocked by the gaping divide between law enforcement and the black communities they are supposed to serve. It was no surprise to us. For black Americans, policing is \"the most enduring aspect of the struggle for civil rights,\" says Muhammad, a historian and director of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in New York. \"It has always been the mechanism for racial surveillance and control.\"\n\nIn the South, police once did the dirty work of enforcing the racial caste system. The Ku Klux Klan and law enforcement were often indistinguishable. Black-and-white photographs of the era memorialize the way Southern police sicced German shepherds on civil rights protesters and peeled the skin off black children with the force of water hoses. Lawmen were also involved or implicated in untold numbers of beatings, killings and disappearances of black Southerners who forgot their place.\n\nIn the North, police worked to protect white spaces by containing and controlling the rising black population that had been propelled into the industrial belt during the Great Migration. It was not unusual for Northern police to join white mobs as they attacked black homeowners attempting to move into white neighborhoods, or black workers trying to take jobs reserved for white laborers. And yet they strictly enforced vagrancy laws, catch-alls that gave them wide discretion to stop, question and arrest black citizens at will.\n\nMuch has changed since then. Much has not.\n\nLast Fourth of July, in a few short minutes as we adults watched the teenager among us talking to the police, we saw Hunter become a little more like us, her faith a little shaken, her place in the world a little less stable. Hunter, who is biracial and lives with her white mother in a heavily white area, had not been exposed to the policing many black Americans face. She was about to be.\n\nOn the phone, she could offer only the most generic of suspect descriptions, which apparently made the officer on the other end of the line suspicious. By way of explanation, Hunter told the officer she was just 16. The police called her back: once, twice, then three times, asking her for more information. The interactions began to feel menacing. \"I'm not from here,\" Hunter said. \"I've told you everything I know.\"\n\nThe fourth time the police called, she looked frightened. Her interrogator asked her, \"Are you really trying to be helpful, or were you involved in this?\" She turned to us, her voice aquiver. \"Are they going to come get me?\"\n\n\"See,\" one of us said, trying to lighten the mood. \"That's why we don't call them.\"\n\nWe all laughed, but it was hollow.\n\nMy friend Carla Murphy and I have talked about that day several times since then. We've turned it over in our minds and wondered whether, with the benefit of hindsight, we should have called 911.\n\nCarla wasn't born in the United States. She came here when she was 9, and back in her native Barbados, she didn't give police much thought. That changed when she moved into heavily black Jamaica, Queens.\n\nCarla said she constantly saw police, often white, stopping and harassing passersby, almost always black. \"You see the cops all the time, but they do not speak to you. You see them talking to each other, but the only time you ever see them interact with someone is if they are jacking them up,\" she said. \"They are making a choice, and it says they don't care about you, it tells you they are not here for your people or people who look like you.\"\n\nCarla herself was arrested at a young age-because she was present when her cousin pushed through a subway turnstile without paying. The teenagers were cuffed, thrown in a paddy wagon, booked and held overnight. At 15, Carla, then a student at The Dalton School, a prestigious private academy in Manhattan, had an arrest record.\n\nThat experience, along with many others, informed Carla's decision on July 4.\n\n\"I am a responsible adult, but I really can't see having a different reaction. Isn't that weird?\" she told me. \"By calling the police, you are inviting this big system-that, frankly, doesn't like you-into your life. Sometimes you call and it is not the help that comes.\"\n\n\"So, no, I wouldn't call the police,\" she said. \"Which is sad, because I want to be a good citizen.\"\n\nI moved to the historic Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn in 2011. Before then, I had been living in Portland, Oregon, and when I chose my new home in the gritty big city, it was partly because it was only a block away from a police precinct. That proximity made me feel safer-I figured crime would be less common with so many police nearby. Inadvertently, however, I also picked a prime target area of the city's stop-and-frisk program-a system of policing that caught so many innocent black and brown men in its dragnet that a federal judge found it unconstitutional in 2013.\n\nMy block is fairly typical of Bed-Stuy. My neighbors, until recently, were all black and included everyone from laborers to college professors. Both immaculately kept brownstones and boarded-up townhouses line my street. We have block meetings and a community garden. Police are a constant presence, speeding down the street to the precinct or walking the beat. Sometimes, I escort my daughter to the store underneath police watchtowers with tinted windows that pop up around the neighborhood with no warning, then disappear just as suddenly-their entire existence ambiguous yet alarming. I have witnessed from my window, countless times, police stopping someone, usually a young man, who is walking down the street. These men are often searched and questioned as they go to the bodega or head home from work or school.\n\nA few months ago, a police officer approached my neighbor as he was leaving the bodega and began questioning him. My neighbor is quiet and respectful, but he also is poor and transient. He tends to look disheveled, but the worst thing I've seen him do is drink beer on the stoop.\n\nWhen he asked why he was being stopped, the police grabbed him and threw him to the ground. As someone recorded the incident on a cellphone, police shot my neighbor with a Taser gun and then arrested him.\n\nHe was never told why police stopped him. The only thing they charged him with was resisting arrest. But this arrest cost him his job and a fine he will struggle to pay. If he doesn't pay, a judge will issue a bench warrant, and instead of preventing crime, the police will have created a criminal.\n\nCrowds of mostly white protesters have defied Ohio's stay-at-home order without arrest, while in several of the state's biggest jurisdictions, police departments have primarily arrested black people for violating the order.\n\nAcross the street and a few doors down from me, my neighbor Guthrie Ramsey has his own story. Guthrie was born in Chicago and grew up in a family that did not emphasize the obstacles their children would face. \"I was socialized to believe that the police were our friends,\" he said.\n\nYet one night, some years ago, while driving his teenage son to a soccer game, Guthrie was pulled over by police. Within minutes, he and his son were sprawled on the ground, with guns drawn on them. The police believed Guthrie fit the description of a suspect. Guthrie, a short, easy-going guy with a contagious laugh, managed to point the police to his University of Pennsylvania faculty ID. That's right: He's an Ivy League professor. And a noted musician.\n\n\"It was so frightening. It was humiliating. You get so humiliated that it's hard to even get to the anger,\" he told me. \"You just don't get to experience interactions with the police as a garden-variety circumstance.\"\n\nThese types of stories in black communities are so ubiquitous as to be unremarkable. If my husband is running very late and I cannot get hold of him, my mind does not immediately go to foul play. I wonder if he's been detained.\n\nThis fear is not unjustified. Young black men today are 21 times more likely to be shot and killed by police than young white men. Still, it's not that black Americans expect to die every time they encounter the police. Police killings are just the worst manifestations of countless slights and indignities that build until there's an explosion.\n\nSince 1935, nearly every so-called race riot in the United States-and there have been more than 100-has been sparked by a police incident, Muhammad says. This can be an act of brutality, or a senseless killing. But the underlying causes run much deeper. Police, because they interact in black communities every day, are often seen as the face of larger systems of inequality in the justice system, employment, education and housing.\n\nIn the months since Ferguson, many pundits have asserted that black Americans deserve this type of policing, that it is a consequence of their being more likely to be both the perpetrators and victims of violent crime. \"White police officers wouldn't be there if you weren't killing each other,\" former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani argued on Meet the Press as the nation awaited the grand jury decision in the Michael Brown shooting. It should be noted that Giuliani oversaw the NYPD during two of the most notorious cases of police brutality in recent memory, the sodomy of Abner Louima and the death of Amadou Diallo , who was unarmed, in a hail of 41 bullets. Both were black men.\n\nWhat Giuliani was saying, in essence, is that law-abiding citizens deserve to be treated with suspicion because they share racial traits with the tiny number among them who commit crimes.\n\nBlack communities want a good relationship with law enforcement because they want their families and property to be safe. After all, it is true that black communities often face higher rates of crime; in 2013, more than 50 percent of murder victims across the country were black, though only 13 percent of the total population is. But it's also true that crime reduction efforts by black people in black communities have contributed to the recent, historic drop in crime across the country.\n\nSo why are black Americans still so often denied the same kind of smart policing that typically occurs in white communities, where police seem fully capable of discerning between law-abiding citizens and those committing crimes, and between crimes like turnstile-jumping and those that need serious intervention?\n\n\"You can be protected and served,\" Muhammad says. \"It happens every day in communities across America. It happens all the time in white communities where crime is happening.\"\n\nDuring the height of the \"Black Lives Matter\" protests, a mentally ill man shot and killed two police officers a few blocks from my home. I lay up that night thinking about those two men and their families. No one wants to see people killed. Not by police, not by anyone. The next morning, my husband and I took food and flowers to the grim brick precinct right around the corner from us that the officers were working out of when they were killed.\n\nThe officer at the front desk did not greet us when we came in. And he looked genuinely surprised by our offering, his face softening as he told us we didn't have to do this, but thank you. That people who should be allies somehow felt like adversaries troubled me.\n\nThe next day, I drove by the precinct on my way to the store. It had been cordoned off with metal barricades. Two helmeted officers stood sentry out front, gripping big black assault rifles, and watching. The message felt clear.\n\nThey weren't standing out there to protect the neighborhood. They were there to protect themselves from us.\n\nFor more of Nikole Hannah-Jones' work on race and inequality in the nation's schools and neighborhoods, see School Segregation, the Continuing Tragedy of Ferguson .\n\nNikole Hannah-Jones\n\nNikole Hannah-Jones covered civil rights and fair housing for ProPublica.

To understand why COVID-19 killed so many young Black men, you need to know the legend of John Henry.\n\nby Akilah Johnson and Nina Martin\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nThe Rev. Dr. Kejuane Artez Bates was a big man with big responsibilities. The arrival of the novel coronavirus in Vidalia, Louisiana, was another burden on a body already breaking under the load. Bates was in his 10th year with the Vidalia Police Department , assigned as a resource officer to the upper elementary school. But with classrooms indefinitely closed, he was back on patrol duty and, like most people in those early days of the pandemic, unprotected by a mask. On Friday, March 20, he was coughing and his nose was bleeding. The next day, he couldn't get out of bed.\n\nBates was only 36, too young to be at risk for COVID-19, or so the conventional wisdom went. He attributed his malaise to allergies and pushed forward with his second full-time job, as head pastor of Forest Aid Baptist Church , working on his Sunday sermon between naps. Online church was a new concept to his parishioners, and during the next morning's service, he had to keep reminding them to mute their phones. As he preached about Daniel in the lion's den - we will be tested, but if we continue to have faith, we will come through - he grimaced from the effort. That night he was burning up with fever. Five days later he was on a ventilator; five days after that, he died.\n\nWhile COVID-19 has killed 1 out of every 800 African Americans , a toll that overwhelms the imagination, even more stunning is the deadly efficiency with which it has targeted young Black men like Bates. One study using data through July found that Black people ages 35 to 44 were dying at nine times the rate of white people the same age, though the gap slightly narrowed later in the year. And in an analysis for ProPublica this summer using the only reliable data at the time accounting for age, race and gender, from Michigan and Georgia, Harvard researcher Tamara Rushovich found that the disparity was greatest in Black men. It was a phenomenon Enrique Neblett Jr. noticed when he kept seeing online memorials for men his age. \"I'll be 45 this year,\" said the University of Michigan professor, who studies racism and health. \"I wasn't seeing 60- and 70-year-old men. We absolutely need to be asking what is going on here?\"\n\nTo help illuminate this gap in knowledge and gain a deeper understanding of why America has lost so many young Black men to COVID-19, ProPublica spent months gathering their stories, starting with hundreds of news articles, obituaries and medical examiners' reports, then interviewing the relatives and friends of nearly two dozen men, along with researchers who specialize in Black men's health. Our efforts led us to a little-known body of research that takes its name from one of the most enduring symbols of Black American resilience.\n\nAs the legend goes, John Henry was a steel-driving man who defeated a steam-powered drill and died with a hammer in his hand. The folktale celebrates one man's victory against seemingly insurmountable odds. But it holds another, harsher truth: His determination and strength are also what killed him. The John Henry of contemporary social theory is a man striving to get ahead in an unequal society. The effort of confronting that machine, day in and day out, compounded over a lifetime, leads to stress so corrosive that it physically changes bodies, causing Black men to age quicker, become sicker and die younger than nearly any other U.S. demographic group. COVID-19 is a new gear in an old machine.\n\nIn interviews about the young men who died from the virus, a portrait emerged of a modern John Henry: hard-working, ambitious, optimistic and persistent, trying to lift others along with themselves. They were the very people communities would have turned to first to help recover from the pandemic: entrepreneurs who were also employers; confidants like coaches, pastors and barbers; family men forced into a sandwich generation younger than their white counterparts, because their parents got sick earlier and they had to care for them while raising kids of their own.\n\nThey were ordinary men. Time and again, it was their fight that was remarkable.\n\nBates, the only child of a single mother who supported him as a teacher's aide, made it to Alcorn State University on football and choir scholarships. When his mother got sick with breast cancer, he had to drop out; after she died, he was almost destitute. Over the years, he built himself into multiple men at once, each a pillar to many others: the pastor whose flock depended on his counsel; the mentor known to school kids as Uncle Officer Bates; the assistant football coach and band director ; the adoring father to 5-year-old Madison - his \"heartbeat,\" he called her. Recently he and his wife, Chelsea, a second grade teacher, had launched One Love Travel, organizing excursion packages and cruises as part of their long-term plan to build generational wealth.\n\nHe carried the stress of his efforts in his blood vessels, in his kidneys, in the extra pounds that accumulated with each passing year; he had diabetes and hypertension and at 6-foot-6, he was more than 100 pounds overweight. His official cause of death, on April 1, was COVID-19-related pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\nBut Chelsea knows that the virus, no matter how powerful, didn't kill her husband on its own. It was the years of working nonstop, taking care of other people more than himself, that wore his body down. And when the virus attacked, he couldn't fight back.\n\nIn the summer of 1978, the social epidemiologist Sherman James , then a 34-year-old researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, met the man who would shape his life's work. At 70, John Martin was a retired farmer who suffered from debilitating osteoarthritis and hypertension. He had peptic ulcers so severe that doctors had to remove 40% of his stomach. Recounting his story in his backyard rocking chair, his cane resting on his lap, the old man had no doubt why his health was so bad: \"I worked too hard.\"\n\nBorn in 1907, Martin grew up in a family of sharecroppers who were only paid half of what their labor in the tobacco fields earned. Throughout the South at the time, most Black farmers lived at the economic mercy of landowners who were employers, landlords and vendors all at once. Martin watched as the system ruthlessly exploited his father; after one particularly harsh winter spent hungry, Martin vowed he would be different. Borrowing $3,725 in 1941, he purchased 75 acres. He had 40 years to settle the mortgage but accomplished the near-impossible: He paid it off in five. \"That's the reason my legs [are] all out of whack today,\" he told James.\n\nJames listened, spellbound, until Martin's wife called out, \"John Henry, it's time for lunch.\" At that moment, something clicked. Holy cow, James remembers thinking. \"It was just like the ancestors were speaking to me.\" The power of Martin's story wasn't simply that it echoed the legend of John Henry; it also echoed the life experiences of most of the working-class African American men James knew.\n\nFive years out of graduate school, James was among a small group of researchers focusing on one of the most enduring public health problems in the United States: why health outcomes for Black men are so poor. Black men live shorter lives than all other Americans - 71.5 years versus 76.1 years for white men - and have for generations. Black men's life expectancy didn't reach 65, the eligibility age for Medicare, until 1995, 30 years after the federal health program for the elderly became law; white men were living into their mid-60s by 1950. The shorter lifespans reflect a broader disparity: Black people have much higher rates of hypertension, obesity, diabetes and strokes than white people do, and they develop those chronic conditions up to 10 years earlier. The gap persisted this year when the Brookings Institution examined COVID-19 deaths by race; in each age category, Black people were dying at roughly the same rate as white people more than a decade older.\n\nFor generations, public health experts mostly ignored the disparities. When they did pay attention, they invariably blamed the victims - their \"unhealthy\" behaviors and diets, their genes, the under-resourced neighborhoods they \"chose\" to live in and the low-paying jobs they \"chose\" to work. Their chronic illnesses were seen as failures of personal responsibility. Their shorter life expectancy was written off to addiction and the myth of \"black-on-black\" violence . Many of those arguments were legacies of the slave and Jim Crow eras, when the white medical and science establishment promoted the idea of innate Black inferiority and criminality to rationalize systems built on servitude and segregation.\n\nPondering the lessons of John Henry Martin , James began to see what many of his colleagues had been missing. It wasn't just living in poverty that wore down Black men's bodies, he hypothesized, but the struggle to break out of poverty. It wasn't just inequality that made them sick, but the effort to be equal in a system that was fundamentally unjust. \"It's this striving to make something of themselves ... to live their lives with dignity and purpose and to be successful against extraordinary circumstances,\" James said. \"They're trying to make a way out of no way. It's the Black American story.\"\n\nAmerica has changed profoundly since Martin's day. Yet the machinery of racial inequality continues to be omnipresent. It's in the hospitals where Black newborns have significantly lower mortality if they're cared for by Black doctors rather than white ones. In the redlined neighborhoods where poverty and pollution are concentrated - but not affordable housing or grocery stores or reliable internet. It's in the crumbling, exploitative economies that force parents to risk their lives working long hours for low pay without sick leave. In mass incarceration and voter suppression. In the innumerable hurdles, one piled upon another, that make Black Americans' climb up the socioeconomic ladder more daunting than ever, their successes more fragile and their setbacks more consequential.\n\n\"Everyone thinks about racism as something that is personally mediated, like someone insulting me,\" said Linda Sprague Martinez , a professor at Boston University's School of Social Work who conducts community health research with adolescents and young adults. \"But the way in which it's really pervasive is how it disrupts life chances and opportunity. ... These are systems that are designed for you to fail, essentially, and for you to be erased and to be maintained in a certain position in our society.\"\n\nChallenging such a relentless machine, through \"high-effort coping,\" James concluded, requires three categories of personal traits that are major themes of the John Henry legend: tenacity, mental and physical vigor and a commitment to hard work. To measure them, he developed the John Henryism scale, with scores determined by how strongly people identify with 12 statements, including: \"Once I make up my mind to do something, I stay with it until the job is completely done,\" and, \"It's not always easy, but I usually find a way to do what really needs to be done.\"\n\nTo score high in John Henryism, you don't have to be Black or male or economically disadvantaged. But over the years, James and other researchers have found that Black people, especially those who are poor and working-class, do score high and tend to suffer greater cardiovascular risks, perhaps because the innumerable hurdles in their paths require greater effort to overcome. \"The stress,\" James said, \"is going to be far more overwhelming than it has a human right to be.\"\n\nStress is a physiological reaction, hard-wired in the body, that helps protect it against external threats. At the first sign of danger, the brain sounds an alarm, setting off a torrent of neurological and hormonal signals that whoosh into the blood, stimulating the body to fight or give flight. The heart beats faster and breathing quickens; blood vessels dilate, so more oxygen reaches the brain and muscles. The immune system's inflammatory response is activated to promote quick healing. When the threat passes, hormone levels return to normal, blood glucose ebbs and heart rate and blood pressure go back to baseline. At least, that's how the human body is designed to work.\n\nBut overexposure to cortisol and other stress hormones can cause the gears to malfunction. \"Your body's over-producing, always working hard to bring itself back down to the normal level,\" said Roland J. Thorpe Jr ., a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and founding director of the Program for Research on Men's Health at the Hopkins Center for Health Disparities Solutions. The constant strain \"resets the normal,\" he said. As blood pressure remains high and inflammation becomes chronic, the inner linings of blood vessels start to thicken and stiffen, which forces the heart to work harder, which dysregulates other organs until they, too, begin to fail. \"Your body starts to wear down,\" Thorpe said - a phenomenon known as weathering.\n\nThe cumulative effects of stress begin in the womb, when cortisol released into a pregnant woman's bloodstream crosses the placenta; it is one of the reasons a disproportionate number of Black babies are born too early and too small. Then, exposure to adverse childhood experiences - anything from abuse and neglect to poverty and hunger - continues the toxic stream; too much exposure to cortisol at a critical stage in development can rewire the neurological system's fight-or-flight response, essentially causing the brain's stress switch to break. The more stress a youngster endures, the more likely he or she is to have academic, behavioral and health problems from depression to obesity.\n\nWeathering isn't specific to race, but it is believed to take a particular toll on Black people because of the unique, unrelenting stress caused by racism that wears away the body and the spirit, \"just like you have siding on the house, and the rain or the sun beats on it, and eventually it starts to fade,\" said Dr. Jerome Adams , the U.S. surgeon general under the Trump administration. Shawnita Sealy-Jefferson , a social epidemiologist at Ohio State University, says the human body isn't designed to withstand such biological and emotional assaults: \"It's the same thing as if you revved the engine of your car all day, every day. Sooner or later, the car is going to break down.\"\n\nThe effects of stress can be seen at the cellular level. Researchers have found that in Black people, telomeres - repeated sequences of DNA that protect the ends of chromosomes by forming a cap, much like the plastic tip on a shoelace - become shortened at a faster rate , a sign of premature aging. In a 2018 study examining changes in seven biomarkers in cardiac patients over a 30-year period, researchers found that Black patients weathered at an average of about six years faster than whites. And it was the extraordinarily high rates of hypertension in the Black community that prompted scientists to look at the impact of stress in the first place. By age 55, about 76% of Black men and women develop high blood pressure, versus 54% of white men and 40% of white women, which increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes.\n\nSustained stress has strong links to obesity, which Black children and adults have at much higher rates than whites. Some of this is physiological: The interplay between cortisol and glucose is complex and insidious, triggering metabolic changes that can lead to diabetes and other chronic diseases. Some of it is psychological and behavioral: Stress is strongly associated with depression and other mental health disorders. \"The way that people deal with stress is by strategies that make us feel better,\" such as comfort eating, said Thomas LaVeist , dean of Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine. Stress and anxiety cause sleeplessness, which itself is correlated with weight gain. The result is often a cascade of health problems - hypertension, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome - that strike early and feed off of each other.\n\nBecause Black Americans experience many forms of stress, often at once, researchers have more questions than answers about the specific role John Henryism plays in these outcomes. The study of Black men's health remains an under-examined frontier, with little in the way of funding or will because \"Black men are not viewed as sympathetic,\" said LaVeist, and because so few go into the health research professions. He and Thorpe, the Johns Hopkins professor, co-founded the Black Men's Health Project , the first large-scale national study focused solely on Black men's needs, with a goal sample size of 5,000. They hope to learn how stressors like segregation and adverse early life experiences impact health outcomes.\n\nIf this segregated body of emerging knowledge were to grow and infiltrate the mainstream medical and research communities, James can only imagine how beneficial that would be. Health professionals could build deeper relationships with their patients by better understanding the sources of stress that wreak havoc on their cardiovascular systems. They could test for high blood pressure, diabetes and cholesterol levels more frequently and at younger ages. \"Until we can have a society that is more just racially,\" James said, \"we do need to find these intermediate steps.\"\n\nAs ProPublica examined the lives lost to COVID-19, themes emerged in the pressure points faced by many young Black men. The wearing down typically begins when they are boys and must become little John Henrys to navigate white spaces or push through the adverse experiences endemic to Black communities. It continues when they grow into men, as most need to navigate the public's projections of danger with unwavering vigilance. The more they succeed, the more responsibility they feel to lift their families and communities with them, and with that, comes more stress.\n\nAs James listened to the stories ProPublica was gathering, he instantly recognized the cycle of striving and succumbing that he has been writing about for 40 years. \"They could have done so much more had the struggle not been so intense,\" James said. \"They were cut down too soon.\"\n\nThomas Fields Jr. was barely a year old when his father first went to prison. The loss altered the trajectory of his life in ways that many children wouldn't have been able to overcome. His mother, just 17 when he was born, moved with him from the suburbs of Washington, D.C., to Detroit, where her own mother had recently relocated. The city was in freefall: manufacturing jobs were disappearing; crime was surging; middle-class and white flight was stripping away the city's tax base, eroding vital services and causing schools to fail. Just waiting at the wrong bus stop could get you robbed or shot.\n\n\"When you're a young male living in Detroit, if you live past 18, it's like you're 50 years old,\" Fields, then 31, said on a Facebook Live chat last year. \"I swear that's how it feels.\"\n\nMitigating childhood adversity requires deep wells of resilience; researchers say one of the best ways to build those reserves is having a nurturing caregiver. In this, young Thomas was exceptionally lucky. His mother worked two jobs and still managed to watch him like a hawk; she told him constantly that she loved him. His grandmothers looked after him after school and during summer breaks. His father, Thomas Sr., did his best to be involved from behind bars, urging him to not make the same mistakes. \"I wanted this Thomas Fields to break the mold,\" he said.\n\nTo do that, Thomas became a little John Henry. He got decent grades, stayed out of trouble and taught himself to cook - healthy food, not the junk so many of his peers ate. After high school, he attended Grambling State University in Louisiana for a couple of years, then joined the U.S. Navy, where he went from being a talented amateur chef to a trained professional. He also became a father. When there were setbacks, he was already planning his next move. It's a strategy that Black adolescents absorb like the air they breathe and the water they drink, Sprague Martinez said. \"The mentality is: 'Even if this system is not designed to work for me ... I'm going to win this game. I haven't gotten the prize yet? I must not be working hard enough.'\"\n\nHigh-effort coping can confer mental health benefits even for children raised in the direst of circumstances. Dosha DJay Joi endured the kind of trauma that dooms many children - beatings, neglect, sexual abuse. Born in Chicago, he spent much of his adolescence in group homes in the Wisconsin system. For years he was afraid to talk about the abuse and scared to tell his birth mother he was queer. He learned to channel himself into education and advocacy, helping other LGBTQ and foster kids; he especially wanted to make sure children remained connected with their siblings. He was inspired to study social work because of what he'd been through, said his mother, Kecha Kitchens. \"Then a family member got sick, and he didn't like how the nurses were treating the other patients in the nursing home, so he wanted to become a nurse.\"\n\nBy the age of 28, Joi had a bachelor's degree in human services, he had trained as a substance abuse counselor and he was working toward his nursing degree. He served as a court-appointed special advocate for kids aging out of foster care and lobbied lawmakers in the Wisconsin capitol and Washington D.C., forming a special bond with Rep. Gwen Moore , who represents Milwaukee in Congress. But the years of hardship took an enormous physical toll; Joi suffered from hypertension, heart and lung problems and at his heaviest, he weighed more than 500 pounds. When COVID-19 arrived in the Midwest, he was particularly vulnerable. He died on May 14.\n\nFor young John Henrys, the psychological benefits of high-effort coping seem to be complicated by what's happening inside the body. \"Typically when you study resilience in any group, and [subjects are] doing well by our typical metrics\" - going to college, getting a good job, not taking drugs - \"we say, 'Woo-hoo,'\" University of Georgia researcher Gene Brody said. \"Logically, we thought this would transfer to have health benefits.\" But for Black young adults trying to climb the economic ladder, they found just the opposite. \"When you look under the skin, doing blood draws and using other kinds of measures, they look like their health is starting to suffer.\"\n\nIn more than 25 years spent tracking the health of Black families in rural Georgia , Brody and his colleagues found that adolescents identified by their teachers as being success-oriented already had higher \"allostatic loads\" - science jargon for wear-and-tear on the body - at age 19 than their peers. By age 25, those from more disadvantaged backgrounds who scored high on the John Henryism scale were more likely to have metabolic syndrome, a cluster of conditions that are precursors to diabetes and heart disease, than people from less disadvantaged backgrounds. Brody and his colleagues have dubbed this phenomenon \"skin-deep resilience.\" The same effects are not found for young white strivers.\n\nIn his late 20s, Fields was diagnosed with such a severe case of diabetes that his military career came to a screeching halt. When he returned to Detroit last year, he was a little brawnier, with more tattoos. \"Diabetes was something that he was going to beat, because he wasn't going to lose to anything,\" said the Rev. Torion Bridges, one of his best friends for 20 years. He became a personal chef and motivational speaker, started a podcast and wrote a cookbook. He helped out his mom, who had multiple sclerosis. And he took a job as a \"school culture facilitator,\" working with kids who had discipline problems, at Paul Robeson Malcolm X Academy, the pioneering Afrocentric public school he had attended. He was especially good with troubled boys who didn't have a father at home, said principal Jeffrey Robinson, his onetime homeroom teacher, later his boss. \"He could identify with the feeling of the loss.\"\n\nIn March, Fields and his mother caught the coronavirus at the same time.\n\nShe recovered. He did not.\n\nTo navigate life as a Black man is to be constantly vigilant. The ubiquity of racism means that everyday interactions, while driving or shopping or birdwatching , can have potentially dangerous outcomes. So John Henrys live in a heightened state of awareness, continually adjusting. It might mean placing family photos near the front door to quickly prove your son belongs should police ever respond. It often means being able to \"strategically assimilate\" - to assume a public identity aimed at neutralizing stereotypes of blackness and defusing irrational white fears. This, W.E.B. DuBois explained more than a century ago, is \"double-consciousness, this sense of always looking at one's self through the eyes of others, of measuring one's soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity.\"\n\nNew York Times columnist Brent Staples would whistle Vivaldi in graduate school to signal that he was too cultured to be threatening. Darrell Hudson , who researches health disparities at Washington University in St. Louis, scans the closet each day before teaching class to select what he calls his \"Non- Threatening Black Guy Uniform.\"\n\n\"What's not appreciated fully, I think, is how much energy it takes,\" said Derek M. Griffith , professor and director of the Center for Research on Men's Health at Vanderbilt University. \"All of these different things that you have to do to modulate your body and so forth, all that additional attention that you have to pay to that, is a burden that most people don't have to bear. It is a cause of weathering that we don't fully appreciate.\"\n\nA 2014 study found that vigilance was positively associated with the prevalence of hypertension for Blacks but not whites. The more vigilant Black people were, the more the disparity grew. And researchers have found that Black people who are on guard against anticipated discrimination have higher blood pressures while they sleep. \"When you experience racism or discrimination and it could cost your life, it's good to be vigilant; but a prolonged and heightened state of vigilance is not good,\" the University of Michigan's Neblett said. \"It can kill you in the end.\"\n\nLeslie Lamar Parker grew up in the Minneapolis suburbs, in a state that was 84% white. Like many John Henrys in this story, he was large - tall and wide - in a way that made him stand out to cruel classmates and clueless teachers. Bigness can be perilous for Black boys, who are often seen as older, stronger and less innocent than their white counterparts, stereotypes that underlie higher rates of school discipline and police violence. Parker learned to play the class clown and questioned authority. \"School couldn't hold his attention, not because he wasn't smart. He wouldn't go,\" his mother, Tyuon Brazell, said. Because he wasn't on track to graduate, she did what other parents might not and suggested he drop out his junior year. That's when he started to thrive, earning his GED, graduating from college and becoming an IT specialist in his old school district, where he mentored students of color, ordering them lunch from DoorDash and supervising the tech club. \"That was really important to him,\" said his wife, Whitney, \"making sure they didn't fail any other brown kids like they failed him.\"\n\nOne key to his coping was overcorrecting for how he might be perceived. Strangers would approach him to say how lovely it was to see him with his son and daughter, a microaggression masquerading as a compliment. He was so sensitive to stereotypes about absent Black fathers, his wife said, he was \"a present parent on steroids.\" To walk through the world as a Black man is to be simultaneously hypervisible and invisible, under surveillance yet never really seen. So he turned his wardrobe into a \"conversation starter,\" an expression of his irreverent personality but also armor against snap judgments about his imposingness. He carried a Spongebob SquarePants backpack to work and often wore a pro-wrestling or superhero T-shirt during off hours.\n\nParker was constantly scanning the horizon for threats against his family and his kids at school, wondering whether there was something more that he could do for them. He projected a cool demeanor, his argumentative wit camouflaging worries that his mother knew kept his head in overdrive. \"I kept telling him: 'Son, you need to rest. You don't have to do everything in a day.'\" He was diagnosed with high blood pressure at just 27 and worried it, and the extra pounds, would keep him from seeing his two children grow up. He died in May from COVID-19 at the age of 31.\n\nThe effort it takes for Black people to navigate mostly white spaces - to get an education, earn a living, take out a loan, raise a child - can be caustic. Their credentials are questioned; expertise doubted . On college campuses , Black students are often asked if they're on a sports scholarship or if they're really students. Research shows that a person doesn't need to be the target of a racist incident for his body to be affected. Watching videos of police killing Black people or even just anticipating a racist experience can trigger the fight-or-flight response. Incidents build up in memories and transform into chronic stressors; ruminating on them can activate the body's biological stress reaction. This happens over and over again, often many times a day, until the cortisol pump essentially breaks.\n\nJoshua Bush, who died in April of COVID-19, slammed up against racial stereotypes in his work as a nurse in South Carolina. There were funny looks from people who didn't expect to see a Black man when he arrived at job interviews and white patients who refused to let him touch them. He told them, \"That is your choice, but you're missing out on great help,\" his mother, Linda, recalled. He and his wife, LaKita, saw the health care industry as their route to upward mobility. She worked in hospital administration; at 30, he was studying to become a registered nurse, working as an LPN.\n\nBush also suffered from a rare enzyme abnormality that caused severe muscle cramps from overexertion, and because of it, trips to the emergency room weren't uncommon. He'd come to accept that the first image doctors and nurses saw - someone Black and overweight - influenced their bedside manner. They treated him like he had no medical knowledge and lectured him about diabetes, though it had nothing to do with why he was seeking care. His experience informed the way he cared for his own patients, part of his \"fight against the system,\" his wife said. At the same time, she could see her husband's stress \"all over his body.\"\n\nLifting as we climb, onward and upward we go. Words that started as a call-to-action at the rise of the Jim Crow South have become an enduring part of the African American experience - and can serve as a unique form of stress. The proverb was born of Black suffragist Mary Eliza Church Terrell's belief that it was incumbent upon the growing Black middle and upper class to use their position to fight racial discrimination and help others rise through education, work and community activism. It is why Thomas Fields was told as a boy that he was \"duty-bound\" to give back to the community once he got an education. Why Dosha Joi advocated for young people in the system \"because someone helped bring out the sunshine in me.\"\n\n\"You're socialized to say it's not just about you. It's really about what you're going to do for your broader community and for your family,\" Washington University's Hudson explained. \"People take it very seriously, trying to light a path for those behind them - even when they're not necessarily in the most stable situation themselves. ... But they're lifting as they climb. That's taxing. That's a visceral stress.\"\n\nIn the Brookhaven, Mississippi, of Eugene Thompson's youth, Black business owners understood that Brookway Boulevard - at least the stretch that ran through downtown - was for white businesses. The election of Barack Obama was a turning point; Thompson figured if a Black man could become president of the United States, surely he could rent a modest space on \"the Boulevard.\" Publicly, his goal was to grow his client base by cutting white people's hair, too. His family knew his aspirations were grander. \"He wanted to do something in Brookhaven to help Black people to get off their knees,\" his mother, Odell Edwards, said. \"We are on our knees.\"\n\nIt's not easy earning a living in Mississippi, where the single most common job is working as a cashier and the $7.25 minimum wage hasn't budged in a decade. Cutting hair came naturally for Thompson, who started on himself at 12. He attended a local beauty academy before he could afford to go to barber school and over the years took the same methodical approach to growing his business - buying secondhand equipment, doing the construction himself, all without bank loans, mentoring or government support.\n\nBut Thompson's real ambition was to start his own school. \"He always tried to encourage the boys in the community, or people who had been in prison and couldn't find a job - 'I can teach you how to cut hair and you can have your own business,'\" his younger sister, Dedra Edwards, said. After three years spent earning his teaching credential, Thompson opened his TaperNation Barber Academy for students last fall. Then he realized graduates needed places to work, so he launched his next project: renovating a second shop nearby where other barbers and hair stylists could rent chairs.\n\n\"It was running him ragged,\" Odell said.\n\nAt 46, Thompson was severely overweight and suffered from lifelong respiratory problems as well as anxiety and sleeplessness. High blood pressure and diabetes ran in his family, but Thompson's true health status was unclear - like more than 15% of Black people in Mississippi, he wasn't insured and avoided going to the doctor except in an emergency. When he started feeling symptoms of COVID-19 in late March, he shrugged them off at first; he'd been having heart palpitations and panic attacks, which his family attributed to stress from work.\n\nAfter he died in early April, leaving behind six children, TaperNation had to shut down. \"You have to have a barber's instructor license to keep it going, and no one else in the family has one,\" his sister said. \"We had to sell almost everything.\"\n\nRecent disasters - Hurricane Katrina, the Great Recession - have shown that Black communities aren't just more vulnerable than white populations to economic and social dislocations; they recover more slowly. The impacts of the pandemic are likely to be magnified because so many deaths have occurred among Black people under age 60, the peak earning years when people raise families, start businesses, amass social capital and create lasting legacies. In addition to the lives it took, COVID-19 has robbed wealth that John Henrys were only beginning to accrue and toppled what they had begun to build for themselves and those around them.\n\nIn many cases, they were the structural beams, holding everything up. \"These are people who help pay bills for people who aren't their biological family members,\" said Sealy-Jefferson, the Ohio State social epidemiologist. \"They bring food when somebody dies. They watch kids when a single mother has to work.\" Some of the biggest losses are intangible, she said: \"social support, emotional support, resource sharing, encouragement, storytelling, role modeling- all of these things that are vital for African Americans in particular, given our history in this country.\"\n\nFields couldn't comfort students reeling from a crisis that has killed more than 1,600 of their loved ones and neighbors. \"It's a tremendous loss,\" said Robinson, his principal. Bates' wife, Chelsea, was too bereaved to go back to work when school resumed, which meant living off of her husband's death benefits and savings; she focused on trying to help Madison process a grief she's too young to understand. \"Sometimes she lays on the floor and kicks and screams that she wants her daddy, that she misses daddy and why did he have to leave?\" she said. \"I tell her, I'm sorry, I wish that mama could do something to bring him back. I really do.\"\n\nWeekday mornings have been quiet without Kendall Pierre Sr. puttering around the house before sunrise so he could open his barbershop by 5 a.m. That's when workers from nearby chemical plants would stop in for a cut or shave after their graveyard shifts. Sundays are different without his sermons at Mt. Zion Baptist Church, in the little town of Ama, Louisiana, followed by a family breakfast his son always looked forward to. \"My grandmother would come. Some of my aunties and cousins. He would put Aunt Jemima batter in the waffle iron and say: 'See? This is better than Waffle House!'\"\n\nSince his dad died in May of COVID-19, Kendall Pierre Jr., a 20-year-old student at Louisiana State University, has felt an overwhelming absence and, at the same time, his father's equally consuming presence. \"I can still hear him,\" he said.\n\nDon't drive with your hoodie on.\n\nWork twice as hard.\n\nReal men don't wear slippers in public; put on some shoes.\n\nThe only child of a single mother, 45-year-old Pierre Sr. took his role as father figure seriously. To nieces and nephews, he was Uncle Dad. To his sons' basketball teams, he was Coach Kendall with the pep talks.\n\nIf a task has begun, never leave it until it's done.\n\nBe the labor great or small, do it well or not at all.\n\nWhen players couldn't afford uniforms or travel for tournaments, he would pay. \"Their parents would send them with all they could, which was sometimes only $5,\" Pierre Jr. said. They could count on him for food, deodorant, even a haircut. \"He would bring his clippers to make sure all the players looked nice.\"\n\nWhen the killing of George Floyd roiled the country, Pierre Jr. had no doubt about how his father would have reacted. He would have talked to officials at the sheriff's office, school board administrators, government leaders. He would have organized community meetings at the church.\n\nHe needed dialysis to stay alive. He couldn't miss a session, not even during a pandemic.\n\nWe're living in troubled times.\n\nHis son thought about that when his friend texted him about organizing a Black Lives Matter protest. \"Since my dad passed, I've had this newfound courage, and this urge to act on things ... to just do things outside of my comfort zone,\" he said.\n\nOn a Saturday morning in June, 400 people joined in the 2.6-mile march from Westbank Bridge Park to St. Charles Parish Courthouse. A local reporter covered it and interviewed Pierre Jr. for a story. \"If we don't speak about systemic racism and police brutality, no change will ever happen,\" he said. \"I feel like it's something that I have to do and be a part of something bigger than just me.\"\n\nHe knows his father would have been proud. His mother was. But she worries, too. Her husband didn't make enough time for doctor's appointments to monitor his Type 2 diabetes, nor did he get much sleep. \"I would tell him, 'Kendall, you need to rest,'\" recalled Sabrina, his wife of 24 years and a registered nurse. \"He would say he could rest when he's dead and gone.\"\n\nShe knows how much goes into taking care of yourself as a Black man and thinks about that every time her sons walk out the door; her daughter, too. \"Lord, I pray for them. ... I tell them: 'Put the seat belt on, drive the speed limit. Make sure you don't get any tickets.' I don't want them to get stopped by a cop.\" Her husband's stature in the community conferred a kind of protection. \"Because of my husband and who he was, people would be looking out for my sons. We don't have that anymore.\"\n\nZipporah Osei and Mollie Simon contributed reporting.\n\nArt Direction by Lisa Larson-Walker.\n\nAbout the Art\n\nElliott Jamal Robbins, 32, is an artist who works in a variety of media, including drawing, printmaking, sculpture and video/animation. He has exhibited artworks in group and solo exhibitions in New York, Chicago, Miami, Berlin and the Netherlands. This is how he described his thinking behind the art in this story:\n\nFor me, the story of John Henry presents problems. Namely, its focus on the physical attributes of the man and celebrating the labor that killed him. In the original tale, John Henry is almost Christlike in his willingness, if not gleeful, in sacrificing his own body. In my own work, I'm always more drawn to the mundane scene. Rather than consider the figure of John Henry as a type or didactic prop to expound the ills of systemic racism, I decided to focus a narrative as though from the point of view of the subject, and we witness his day-to-day experiences as he does.\n\nBeginning on the bus, we are reminded of this as the site where African Americans fought for the basic human right to sit where they chose. From one mode of transportation to another, the horseback rider recalls the notion of the American west, which most often represents a connection to the land, and freedom. In contrasting the horse from the rider, we see that while one figure experiences a kind of liberation, another body is at work which propels this motion. This relationship between horse and rider is a corollary for the relationship between John Henry and the train, a mechanical achievement that would bring with it the promises of cross country travel, commerce and economic prosperity.\n\nThe story of John Henry is a means of making visible the unseen labor, exploitation and oppression of nation building. In this way I want to consider the real impact of systemic racism on those experiencing it daily, as well as decentralize the notion of racial violence from images of murdered black men and women. Instead, I want to consider how violence is enacted everyday, and its key actors are those who participate in systems which are propped up by the degradation of others.\n\nClarification, Dec. 24, 2020: This story was updated to clarify a figure on Black infant mortality.\n\nAkilah Johnson\n\nAkilah Johnson was a narrative health care reporter at ProPublica.\n\nNina Martin\n\nNina Martin was a reporter covering sex and gender issues.

Here's why.\n\nby Ava Kofman and Hannah Fresques\n\nFiscal Responses to COVID-19\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nRecord numbers of Americans are receiving unemployment insurance during the pandemic. That's because of the enormous scale of jobs lost - but also because Congress greatly expanded the number of workers eligible for benefits. For the first time, thanks to the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, part-timers, independent contractors and gig workers qualify for unemployment payments. Black workers are overrepresented in these nontraditional positions, which in the past has contributed to making them less likely to receive unemployment payments than other groups.\n\nYet despite the expansion of eligibility, a smaller percentage of unemployed Black workers are receiving unemployment benefits than white workers during the pandemic, according to national survey data from NORC at the University of Chicago: 13% of jobless Black workers received such payments between April and June, compared with 22% for Hispanic workers and 24% for white workers.\n\nAccording to an analysis of national survey data, Black unemployed workers were about half as likely to receive such benefits.\n\n\"In every recession, we see these same disparities,\" said William Spriggs, a Howard University economist who analyzed the data. After the 2008 financial crisis, for example, 23.8% of jobless Black workers received unemployment vs. 33.2% for white workers, according to a 2012 study of national claims data by the Urban Institute.\n\nSome of the continuing disparity is explained by geography, according to Michele Evermore, a senior policy analyst with the National Employment Law Project. Many states have made it more difficult to access benefits in recent years. In the 1950s, an average of 50% of jobless people were able to regularly access benefits; by the end of 2019, that average had fallen to 28% of workers. The states that have made the deepest cuts to their unemployment programs are mostly in the South and have a higher share of Black residents. In states such as Florida and North Carolina, fewer than 12% of jobless individuals received benefits last year.\n\nIn the South, and other states shaded lightly below, it's much harder for people to receive unemployment benefits. For example, 10% of jobless residents in North Carolina got benefits in 2018, compared with 50% in New Jersey.\n\nAmong those who received unemployment benefits in 2018, the program replaced 36% of lost wages in Louisiana, compared with 53% in Iowa.\n\nAs a result, the weaker benefits in those states disproportionately affect Black unemployed workers.\n\nThese low rates perpetuate themselves. People in states with restrictive benefits are often deterred from applying for them, research shows , because they perceive themselves to be ineligible, whether or not they actually are. Moreover, workers who have been historically excluded - because they are temporary employees or work on call - may not know the new pandemic assistance program exists and, therefore, may not have bothered to apply for benefits at all. Black workers have been applying for benefits during the pandemic at a lower rate than white workers, according to the NORC survey.\n\nThe inequity in unemployment benefits is all the more damaging because Black workers have been more likely to be unemployed in both the current downturn and in past recessions . Even when the economy is healthy, Black unemployment is dramatically higher - often double - that of white workers. The gap cannot be explained by gender, age or education level . (Were it not for the fact that Black workers are overrepresented in transit and service industry jobs currently deemed \"essential,\" the rate of Black unemployment today would be even worse.)\n\nBlack households have long suffered from lower wages, lower incomes and fewer assets to fall back on than white households. \"Because Black households have one-tenth of the wealth of white households, it's that much more important that unemployment insurance kicks in to reduce the different experiences across these racial groups,\" said Damon Jones, an economist who teaches at the University of Chicago. \"If you start out with less wealth and you have less access to unemployment insurance, you're doubling down on this negative impact.\"\n\nThat scenario appears to be playing out today. A Pew study in April found 48% of Black Americans were having trouble paying bills, compared with 44% for Hispanics and 26% for whites.\n\nEven when Black workers do obtain benefits, they often receive smaller payments than white workers, since the benefits are determined by salary and Black workers earn less at every education level. \"If your historical earnings reflect labor market discrimination, you're going to get hit with lower benefits,\" said Jared Bernstein, a fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. \"The underlying formulas of the system reflect this historical discrimination.\"\n\nThe catastrophic loss of millions of U.S. jobs is another part of the coronavirus pandemic that is falling disproportionately onto the shoulders of Black Americans.\n\nBlack workers are also more likely to exhaust the standard 26 weeks of benefits than white counterparts because they tend to stay unemployed longer than their white peers. Job discrimination in the labor market and fewer workplace protections mean that Black workers are typically the first to lose their jobs and the last to get them back.\n\nIf the longstanding gulf suggests a two-tiered unemployment system, that's by design. \"You wonder why this system is so messy and complicated,\" Jones said. \"And then you look back in the history and you see that the origins of some of these barriers were driven by racism and xenophobia.\"\n\nThe Social Security Act established unemployment insurance, in 1935, as a joint federal-state system. It had a narrow definition of who deserved benefits: full-time breadwinners who had been momentarily laid off but would return to work as soon as business picked up. This definition deliberately excluded agricultural and domestic workers, jobs held predominantly by Black Americans, from its purview.\n\nHistorians have debated the extent to which these exclusions stemmed from racial animus. But whatever the motivations, the original definitions had a disparate impact: 65% of Black workers fell outside the reach of the new program, and in agrarian parts of South, that number went up to 80%, according to Larry DeWitt, a former historian for the Social Security Administration.\n\nThe economy has radically changed, but the unemployment system has remained largely the same. (Domestic workers and farmworkers were included in 1950s amendments to the bill.) \"Our unemployment system has not kept up with the changing demographics of the American labor force,\" Spriggs said.\n\nIt's been decades since employers began abandoning traditional work practices, in which full-time staffers put in 40-hour weeks, in favor of part-time arrangements and independent contractors. One study from the National Bureau of Economic Research found \"all the net employment growth in the United States from 2010 to 2015\" took place through what it called \"precarious\" arrangements: temporary help agency work, on-call work, contract work and independent contracting. Such arrangements account for 40% of all jobs, according to estimates in a 2015 GAO report , and are expected to increase as the economy emerges from the pandemic.\n\nDespite the pandemic assistance program passed by Congress in March, the outdated vision of employment in most state unemployment systems continues to put Black, Hispanic and female workers at a disadvantage. These workers not only disproportionately hold on-call, temp or contingent positions. They also get shut out of the system because they are more likely than white men to work sporadically or leave work for child care - scenarios that render them ineligible for benefits.\n\nMeanwhile, the pandemic program that expands unemployment eligibility is temporary; it expires on Dec. 31. So far, the various rounds of negotiations on extending congressional funding for unemployment have not focused on continuing the expanded eligibility. Economists like Evermore have called for legislation that would permanently include contingent workers - and increase the amount and duration of benefits. The continuing inequities, she said, make the nation's unemployment system \"far less effective at countering recessions than it could be.\"\n\nFiled under:\n\nAva Kofman\n\nAva Kofman was a reporter on ProPublica's national desk.\n\nHannah Fresques\n\nHannah Fresques is the deputy data editor at ProPublica.\n\nGet our investigations delivered to your inbox with the Big Story newsletter.\n\nCreative Commons License (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0)\n\nThank you for your interest in republishing this story.

      "text": "ProPublica logo\n\nThe American Diabetes Association is creating an initiative to fight unnecessary amputations, which a ProPublica investigation found disproportionately affect Black diabetics. Congress, doctors and the public are finally taking notice, too.\n\nby Lizzie Presser\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nPrompted by a ProPublica story that detailed how Black Americans with diabetes lose limbs at a rate triple that of others, the American Diabetes Association has included an initiative to prevent unnecessary amputations as part of an unprecedented campaign to reduce racial disparities in diabetes care.\n\n\"The ProPublica article raised the consciousness of what the problem is,\" said Tracey Brown, the CEO of the ADA. \"Every four minutes, someone is losing a limb from diabetic complications. That's ridiculous. We have got to find a way to drive change.\"\n\nThe story highlighted obstacles to equitable care for diabetic patients at risk of amputation, from the government's decision not to endorse screening at-risk patients for vascular disease in the legs, to the inadequate incentives for certain specialists to move to underserved areas, to the health system's failure to consider limb-saving options before permitting surgeons to apply a blade.\n\nSubscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\nIn the weeks that followed publication, several congressional and state legislative offices reached out to the association to ask for guidance on drafting policy to reduce disparities in diabetic amputations. In response, the organization decided to build an agenda around the issue.\n\nThe ADA's Health Equity Now campaign, which addresses the cost of diabetes care, nutrition, discrimination and more, was motivated by the racial health disparities that have been exposed by COVID-19, which has hit Black Americans with diabetes particularly hard. As part of the project, the association has built a Health Equity Bill of Rights , asserting that all diabetes patients are entitled to affordable drugs, healthy food, the latest medical advances and other protections.\n\nThe right to avoid preventable amputations is the only complication of uncontrolled diabetes that is included in the list. The organization is sharing the document with policymakers, practitioners and patients as it begins to look toward policy change. It is also encouraging members of the public to ask their governors to support the project.\n\nDr. Ronald Dalman, the president of the Society for Vascular Surgery, said: \"I commend the ADA for doubling down on this particular complication of poorly managed diabetes. It's a long overdue prioritization.\" He added that it's a \"moment in time where we can leverage this concern about health care disparities to call out a very specific problem: the prevalence of amputation in certain subsets of the population.\"\n\nDr. Gary Puckrein, the head of the National Minority Quality Forum, a nonprofit focused on reducing health care disparities, said that the ADA's efforts are just a step. \"The American health care system was organized during an era when inequality was acceptable and mainstream in American society,\" he said. \"It's not that African Americans are sicker, it's that the health care delivered is unequal.\"\n\nHe hopes that the national conversation on health disparities will mirror the conversation about police violence against Black Americans. \"You, in effect, have your knees on their neck in the health care system as well when you don't provide them with the care that they need.\"\n\nBlack patients were losing limbs at triple the rate of others. The doctor put up billboards in the Mississippi Delta. Amputation Prevention Institute, they read. He could save their limbs, if it wasn't too late.\n\nTwo weeks after publication of the story, Rep. Bennie Thompson , a Democrat from Mississippi, honored Dr. Foluso Fakorede, the main subject of the ProPublica article, for his work in reducing unnecessary amputations in Bolivar County, Mississippi. The acknowledgement, made in the House of Representatives, referenced ProPublica's findings.\n\nThe co-chairs of the Congressional Peripheral Artery Disease Caucus - Rep. Donald M. Payne Jr. , a Democrat from New Jersey, and Rep. Gus Bilirakis , a Republican from Florida - have also begun work on a bill to address disparities in amputations, particularly for people with peripheral artery disease, a condition in which clogged arteries in the legs limit the flow of blood.\n\n\"The ProPublica article has brought strong awareness and real interest from a variety of parties - from the medical field and from patients and from potentially future patients,\" said a spokesman for Payne. \"We have been working with Bilirakis and other members to move this forward, with the ultimate goal of introducing legislation.\"\n\nSummer Blevins, deputy chief of staff for Bilirakis, added that their legislative ambition \"is based on the basic principle that prevention, education and early intervention is best for the patient and also saves money.\"\n\nLizzie Presser\n\nLizzie Presser covers health, inequality and how policy is experienced for ProPublica.\n\nGet our investigations delivered to your inbox with the Big Story newsletter.\n\nCreative Commons License (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0)\n\nThank you for your interest in republishing this story.

      "text": "The University Uprooted a Black Neighborhood. Then Its Policies Reduced the Black Presence on Campus.\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nThis article was produced for ProPublica's Local Reporting Network in partnership with the Virginia Center for Investigative Journalism at WHRO . Sign up for Dispatches to get stories like this one as soon as they are published. This story was co-published with VCIJ and The Chronicle of Higher Education .\n\nMore than most public colleges, Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Virginia, is the embodiment of one person's vision.\n\nPaul Trible was CNU's president from 1996 to 2022, serving almost three times as long as anyone else. He remains a distinguished professor at the school and its highest-paid employee, making more than half a million dollars a year. A former congressman and U.S. senator, Trible took over a young university and transformed it from a commuter school into a residential campus. He boosted the school's endowment from $300,000 to $64 million. Construction during his presidency included a student union, dormitories, a theater and concert hall, a baseball stadium and a chapel. The CNU library underwent major renovation and was renamed after Trible and his wife.\n\nThe longtime Republican politician also left another, less-noted legacy: a decline in the Black presence both on campus and in the adjacent neighborhood. Under his stewardship, the university pursued policies that thinned the ranks of Black students and faculty even as its continuing expansion eradicated a nearby Black community.\n\n\"For our area, a school that's built on land that was taken from Black Americans\" should be more diverse, said Audrey Perry Williams, president of the Hampton Roads chapter of the Association for the Study of African American Life and History, during a university-sponsored panel discussion on CNU's history in November. \"It's just amazing that we've got all of this technology, we've got this outstanding institution here. And we're not represented.\"\n\nUnder Trible, CNU prioritized recruiting from affluent, largely white suburban high schools, according to current and former university officials.\n\nIn a state that is one-fifth African American and a city that is 44% Black, CNU's Black enrollment dropped from 17% to 7% during Trible's administration. It now stands at 8%.\n\nThe share of low-income students also decreased. The fifth most expensive of Virginia's 15 public universities. CNU has the highest average net price - the actual cost of attending after subtracting grants and scholarships - for students from families with incomes under $30,000, according to state data.\n\nPell Grants, the federal financial aid program for low-income students, demonstrate the shift. From 1996, when Trible became president, to 2017, the last year for which federal data is available, the number of Pell Grant recipients at CNU dropped by 26%. Over the same period, the number of recipients nationally almost doubled. According to state data, the number of CNU students on Pell Grants declined by about one-third, from 1,003 in 1996 to 663 in 2021.\n\nProportions of Black and Low-Income Students at Christopher Newport University Dropped as Recruiting Efforts Targeted Affluent Suburbs\n\nBlack representation among professors is even more sparse. Out of CNU's 286 full-time faculty in the fall of 2021, only seven, or 2.4%, were Black, the lowest percentage since at least 1993 and well below the national average of 6%, according to U.S. Department of Education data. One factor: CNU's hiring criteria favored candidates from schools that were highly ranked by U.S. News & World Report, putting applicants from historically Black colleges and universities at a disadvantage.\n\nQuestions of racial discrimination have plagued Christopher Newport, which has 4,500 students and an annual revenue of about $180 million, since its birth as an all-white branch of the Colleges of William and Mary system in 1960. As ProPublica and Virginia Center for Investigative Journalism at WHRO previously reported, the city of Newport News seized the core of a middle-class Black community by eminent domain as a site for the new college's campus, bypassing other, less-expensive locations. Under Trible, the university completed the neighborhood's erasure by acquiring almost all of the remaining homes.\n\nAs CNU president, Trible's actions and comments on race-related issues sometimes stirred controversy. In 2003, the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found reasonable cause for a complaint by two former CNU employees - a Black police officer and a white security guard with an adopted Black daughter - who had quit after two campus officers used racial slurs and made death threats. The EEOC urged CNU to rehire the complainants, pay their lost wages and discipline the offending officers.\n\nTrible refused. He said in an email to faculty and staff that CNU had investigated the case \"aggressively and exhaustively\" and \"determined that these are unfounded allegations of disgruntled former employees.\" The Department of Justice, to which the EEOC refers cases when its findings aren't heeded, decided not to sue the university. The security guard, William Nowinsky, received the department's approval to file a lawsuit, but couldn't afford to do so.\n\nAfter a white police officer murdered George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, in Minneapolis in May 2020, Trible emailed the CNU community, deploring not only the deaths of Floyd and other victims of police violence, but also the vandalism associated with protests sweeping the country. \"My own son's business,\" a luxury clothing store in Richmond, \"was ransacked, and all of his merchandise and cash register carried off,\" Trible said. In response, 1,700 students and alumni signed a letter criticizing him as \"tone deaf\" to racism. Trible then apologized, writing, \"I hear your cry for change. ... Black lives matter to me and always have and always will.\" CNU also created a scholarship in Floyd's memory for undergraduates from underrepresented groups.\n\nThat summer, more than 180 CNU faculty members wrote to Trible and members of the school's board, urging them \"to recognize and address our own university's role in reproducing systemic inequality. ... We believe that demographic disparities, alongside a number of university policy decisions, foster an environment that produces a strong anti-Black bias.\"\n\nAmong other policy changes requested in the letter, the writers urged CNU to make Martin Luther King Day a university holiday. Although Trible voted as a senator in 1983 for a national holiday in King's honor, a ProPublica-VCIJ survey found that Christopher Newport was the last Virginia state university to recognize it as a holiday, not doing so until 2021. Asked why, CNU and Trible did not respond.\n\nIn 2019, the Phi Beta Kappa Society, which has almost 300 member colleges, rejected CNU's request to set up a chapter on campus and encouraged the school to pursue greater diversity. \"A diverse faculty, staff, and student body allows ideas to emerge for the benefit of the entire campus community,\" Frederick M. Lawrence, the honor society's secretary and CEO, wrote in a letter explaining the decision. \"There are elements that Christopher Newport can point to with pride, especially that the Board of Visitors has affirmed the importance of free inquiry. It is important as well that the campus culture support that commitment.\"\n\nIn the past, Trible has attributed the drop in Black enrollment to higher admissions standards , but neither he nor CNU answered a detailed list of questions about this and other aspects of his record as president. \"We want to learn and understand the University's full history,\" current President William Kelly said in a statement. \"As we examine our past, we seek to contribute to the future of Virginia and Newport News, our hometown that we cherish. We welcome local high school students to an innovative, no-cost, pre-college program. We're offering expanded scholarships and direct admission to first-generation and low-income students. We are recruiting more diverse students and faculty and we are committed to building stronger connections with our neighbors and community.\"\n\nIn a September message to faculty and staff, Kelly also acknowledged \"the impacts on the community from the location and expansion of the campus.\" Christopher Newport's growth \"has come at a human cost, and we must continue to learn about and understand our complicated history,\" Kelly said.\n\nAs the campus expanded, so did Trible's pay. Between 2010 and 2022, he earned at least $10 million in combined compensation from CNU and its real estate foundation. On average, Trible was paid $772,000 annually during this period, with roughly $425,000 coming from the university and $347,000 coming from the foundation, according to public tax filings. In all but one year between 2010 and 2021, Trible's pay exceeded that of his counterpart at another state university in Virginia, Old Dominion, that has five times as many students as Christopher Newport, according to compensation data on the most recent tax forms from each school's real estate foundation.\n\nAs a tenured professor in the department of leadership and American studies, Trible's current salary is $524,000, paid by the real estate foundation, according to a university spokesperson. Trible is not teaching this year. According to his contract, he does not have \"any obligations\" this year. He may start teaching next year, the spokesperson said. The other former CNU president and distinguished professor, Anthony Santoro, who is teaching this year, is making $200,464. The current president, Kelly, a retired rear admiral and former superintendent of the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, earns $400,000.\n\nTrible's post-presidential pay has become an issue on campus. At an all-faculty meeting in August 2022, James Bogenpohl, an associate professor of biology and neuroscience, asked provost Quentin Kidd how much Trible was making. Kidd said he didn't know and faculty would have to submit a public records request, Bogenpohl said. They did so. At a similar meeting a year later, which included a discussion of budget cuts to faculty merit awards and research, Bogenpohl stood and read from Trible's contract, questioning its generous terms in a time of belt-tightening. Some professors applauded, Bogenpohl said, while others looked shocked that he would criticize the revered ex-president. Trible didn't attend the meeting. Kidd did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\"Trible claims to love the university,\" Bogenpohl said in an interview. \"You would think if he's going to take a year of leave, he might find it in his heart to take that year without a half-a-million-dollar bonus.\"\n\nThe 76-year-old Trible descends from an old Virginia family. His roots stretch back centuries in Essex County, Virginia, a rural region of former plantations and small commercial ports along the Rappahannock River, about an hour northeast of Richmond.\n\nOne 19th-century ancestor, John Samuel Trible, was a doctor and plantation owner, according to the Essex County Historical Society. John S. Trible enslaved 19 people, including 11 females and 8 males between the ages of 1 and 70, according to the 1850 Federal Census Slave Schedule.\n\nPaul Trible himself owns an antebellum plantation in Kilmarnock, Virginia , called Gascony, which was operated by slave labor in the 18th and 19th centuries. In the 1950s, his parents acquired the main home and property, which Trible eventually inherited. He has bought adjacent properties over the years, reassembling the original plantation. Gascony was named a Virginia landmark in March, and Trible's application to the National Park Service to add it to the national register of historic places was pending as of June. A primary benefit of these designations is that owners may qualify for tax credits for renovations.\n\nTrible's father, Paul Trible Sr., was a business executive, and the family moved frequently. Paul Trible Jr. grew up in Richmond and New Orleans and graduated from high school near Scranton, Pennsylvania.\n\nAs an undergraduate at private, all-male Hampden-Sydney College in southwestern Virginia, he made his goal clear. \"I want to be president of the United States,\" Trible told his adviser, according to \"Crazy as Hell: The Story of the Transformation of Christopher Newport University\" by Ellen Vaughn, which was copyrighted by the university's education foundation and is dedicated to Trible and his wife, Rosemary.\n\nTrible attended law school at Washington and Lee University, where Robert E. Lee became president after commanding Confederate forces in the Civil War. He was elected to Congress in 1976, before his 30th birthday. When he sought reelection two years later, his Democratic opponent criticized him for voting against every priority advocated by the Congressional Black Caucus.\n\nTrible \"has one of the worst records in the entire Congress when it comes to issues important to blacks,\" read a campaign ad by Democrat Lewis Puller. Trible responded that it was ridiculous to characterize his entire record on the basis of 16 votes.\n\nTrible won anyway, and then was elected to the Senate in 1982. A staunch supporter of Ronald Reagan, Trible was viewed as a pragmatist, not a firebrand. Conservative on social issues - he opposed abortion except to save the pregnant person's life - he worked across the aisle to support public education.\n\nIn 1988, during his last full year in the Senate, Trible and Virginia's other Republican senator, John W. Warner, backed the nomination of a local lawyer to the federal bench. The nomination died in committee after it was revealed that the attorney belonged to the James River Country Club in Newport News, which would not admit its first Black member until 1990. Newport News leaders may have wanted to uproot a middle-class Black community nearby because it was close to the country club, where the city's business and political elite played golf, according to CNU historian Phillip Hamilton.\n\nInstead of running for reelection, Trible sought the Republican nomination for governor. He lost and returned to practicing law. He also served on CNU's board of visitors. When CNU's president, Santoro, announced in 1995 that he would resign, Trible was named to the search committee for a new president. After reviewing dozens of applications,Trible surprised other committee members by offering himself as a candidate.\n\n\"I haven't labored in the academic world,\" he told the search committee, according to \"Crazy as Hell.\" \"But I have learned important lessons in government service. I know and love this community and Virginia, and I've come to know and love this school.\"\n\nTrible brought his conservative politics and values to his presidency. For example, his administration imposed traditional standards of fashion. Students who worked part time for the university had to abide by dress codes. In 2013, the code required student employees to wear \"modest\" clothes and jewelry \"in good taste.\" Only women could have fingernail polish, makeup or earrings - and no more than two earrings per earlobe. Visible tattoos were \"not acceptable.\" By 2020, the policy was less specific, but it still said that tattoos and piercings other than earrings could not be visible.\n\nIf Trible was going to be at an event, \"you better wear a tie,\" Bogenpohl said.\n\nWhen Trible arrived, the school had a small endowment and an unimposing campus. Trible proved to be an effective fundraiser. After he networked with politicians across the state in 1996, the legislature increased CNU's funding by 21%, the largest hike of any university that year, according to \"Crazy as Hell.\"\n\nTrible developed a close relationship with Smithfield Foods in nearby Smithfield, Virginia, the world's largest pork producer. In 2005, a $5 million donation from Smithfield established a business school at CNU. Two years later, Trible joined Smithfield's board. The company foundation again donated $5 million in 2011, plus $1 million from its chief executive and his wife for CNU's chapel, which opened in 2012 and features a marble entranceway, a 60-foot cupola and a main hall seating 325 people.\n\nOne of Trible's early moves as president was to establish a real estate foundation - a common strategy at Virginia public universities to reduce reliance on state financing for major projects. It became a vehicle for Christopher Newport to buy and develop adjacent properties, displacing dozens more Black families and a Black church. It offered Trible six-figure bonuses for fundraising for new construction. The foundation also built a five-bedroom, five-bathroom presidential mansion for Trible on the waterfront, with a library, a reception hall and four fireplaces, according to the local newspaper.\n\nDuring his presidency, Trible has said, the university underwent a $1 billion renovation and expansion. In 2019, The Princeton Review ranked CNU as the 17th-most-beautiful campus in America.\n\n\"Paul Trible was a builder,\" former president Santoro said. \"Just look at the place.\"\n\nTrible's plans to reshape the student body were equally ambitious. Christopher Newport's original mission was to serve the rapidly growing student population in the blue-collar Tidewater region. Trible had a different idea. His vision, he told the university alumni magazine in 2006, was to \"offer a private school experience at a public university - great teaching, small classes, lots of personal attention and a marvelous sense of community.\"\n\nDuring his tenure, CNU moved away from vocational programs. In the early 2000s, facing state budget cuts, it eliminated a bachelor's degree program in nursing. Although data on the program's enrollment by race was unavailable, nationally 11% of nursing graduates are Black . It also planned to scuttle teacher education but compromised, after strong criticism from the local community, by creating a master's degree program.\n\nCNU also pivoted to recruiting students from the wealthy suburbs of Richmond and northern Virginia. School officials courted high school guidance counselors there and held annual recruiting events at the opulent, late-19th-century Jefferson Hotel in Richmond, according to Vaughn's book.\n\nTrible himself pitched CNU at the Jefferson Hotel in the fall of 2019, said William Gordon, who attended the session as a prospective student. The event was known at Gordon's suburban Richmond high school as a way for early admission applicants to make an impression, he said. Gordon, who is Black, said he soon noticed how few other Black students were there. \"It was like to the point where, if anybody Black was in that room, you would give a little nod,' he said.\n\nAfter Trible's speech, Gordon and other students lined up to meet him. Trible wrote down many of their names and CNU followed up by immediately accepting some of them, Gordon said. His own acceptance was deferred, but he ultimately enrolled.\n\nIn the long term, CNU has struggled to attract enough high-achieving students from outside its home region. In Trible's first decade as president, the number of CNU applicants soared and its acceptance rate dropped from 82% to about half. The average SAT score of its students rose by more than 200 points, according to media reports, and the graduation rate increased.\n\nBut CNU couldn't sustain this success. Its yield rate - the percentage of admitted students who enroll - has plunged from almost 40% in 2004 and 2005 to 17% in 2021 and 18% in 2022, according to data from the university's office of institutional research .\n\nCNU accepted at least 85% of applicants in 2021 and 2022. Even so, enrollment has skidded 14% in the past decade, increasing CNU's reliance on state funding.\n\nCNU was founded to serve the Newport News area. But by 2014, few of its students were local. The proportion of freshmen coming from Newport News and neighboring Hampton, which both have a plurality Black population, had plummeted from 9% as recently as 2005 to 3.5%. The two cities, Newport News sheriff Gabriel Morgan said, weren't \"seen as the pool to draw from.\"\n\nAs Morgan, who is Black, drove or biked past the campus almost every day, he realized that it didn't reflect the city's makeup. He told then-Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, who agreed that CNU should have more diverse voices in its leadership and appointed Morgan to CNU's board.\n\n\"Trible didn't have the benefit of people challenging his policies,\" Morgan said.\n\nWith Morgan's support, CNU implemented the Community Captains program in 2019. Sophomores at Newport News high schools who have at least a B-plus average and would be the first in their family to go to college are paired with a CNU student mentor and receive academic preparation as well as early admission. Aided by an influx of Community Captains, the number of Black freshmen from Newport News increased to 44 in fall 2021, up from a low of 14 in 2018, but still below levels seen earlier in Trible's presidency.\n\nIn 2018, Trible established a President's Council on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. Two years later, he created the position of chief diversity officer.\n\nStill, Morgan felt that progress was slow and that other board members were more enthusiastic about new buildings than they were about diversity.\n\n\"If you're white, straight and Christian, you're going to love Christopher Newport,\" said Morgan, who left the board in 2022. \"If you're anything other than that, it's going to be a struggle for you. Unfortunately.\"\n\nCNU spokesperson Jim Hanchett said that the university has stepped up its in-person recruiting visits to high schools in the Hampton Roads area, which includes Newport News and Hampton, focusing on underserved communities. It is also offering \"immediate, direct admission\" to more than 30,000 out-of-state students who come from low-income families, who would be the first in their families to go to college, or who are members of underrepresented groups, Hanchett said.\n\nCNU has a Black student organization and several Black fraternities and sororities. But current and former students told ProPublica that they found it hard to be Black on a predominantly white campus. In 2021, in his second semester at CNU, William Gordon transferred to Virginia Commonwealth University due to a dispute over his financial aid and a campus environment that he felt was unwelcoming to Black students, he said.\n\nMatthew Johnson, a Black CNU senior who is a resident assistant in a dormitory, said that a drunken white student there once called him the N-word. When he objected, the student said that Johnson had misheard. \"He told me he said 'bigger,'\" recalled Johnson, who decided not to pursue the matter.\n\nThe Rev. William Spencer, current pastor of a Baptist church that used to be the religious and social center of the Black neighborhood next to campus but has since relocated, said that the school's diversity efforts are more show than substance. \"I'm looking for diversity and inclusion to not just be a word thrown around like a used toothpick but to actually mean something,\" Spencer said at the panel discussion in November on the university's history.\n\nBlack faculty members also said they feel isolated. Trible's predecessor, Santoro, hired about a dozen Black professors over the course of his presidency, including psychology professor Shelia Greenlee and her husband, political scientist Harry Greenlee. The Greenlees soon began hosting a monthly Friday-night dinner for other Black professors, where they discussed topics such as establishing a Black faculty caucus and how to support Black students.\n\n\"It was just an opportunity for us to bond, to connect and to feel comfortable that there was someone else here other than you because there are so few of us,\" Shelia Greenlee said.\n\nAs several Black professors left, the dinners became less frequent. After Trible became president, the Greenlees wanted to revive them, but there weren't enough Black faculty and some of those that were hired didn't stay long. With her husband's retirement two years ago, she said, the number of Black professors at CNU with tenure - lifetime job security - dropped by one-third, from three to two. One of them was Greenlee herself.\n\nOne deterrent to hiring Black faculty was a policy adopted at least 15 years ago under Trible. It said that tenure-track candidates should \"ideally\" have at least one credential, such as a doctorate, from a university ranked as one of the 74 best in the nation by U.S. News & World Report, or a bachelor's degree from one of the top 50 national universities or top 89 liberal arts colleges. Only one historically Black college or university, Spelman College in Georgia, made any of those lists. Another possible credential was Phi Beta Kappa membership, but only four HBCUs have chapters. In their 2020 letter to Trible, faculty members urged CNU to \"immediately abandon\" its reliance on these hiring lists, \"thus eliminating the implicit and explicit racial bias.\" Instead, CNU expanded the criteria to include a degree from one of the top 25 historically Black colleges.\n\nRead More\n\nPatricia Hopkins, a Black associate professor of English, realized when she moved to a new office in 2010 just how much of an anomaly she was. While she and her daughter were shelving books in her new office, a white janitorial staffer came to her door. \"Faculty are going to be here any second to move into these offices, and you haven't even dusted yet,\" he said, tossing rags and a can of furniture polish at her.\n\n\"It never occurred to him that I was actually Dr. Hopkins and this was my office,\" she recalled. \"The likelihood is, he took an educated guess and on this campus, I'm more likely to be the cleaner than be the professor.\"\n\nReach Brandi Kellam at [email protected] or [email protected] and Louis Hansen at [email protected] .\n\nFiled under -\n\nGabriel Sandoval is a research reporter with ProPublica.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "Task Force to Consider \"Restorative Justice\" for Black Families Uprooted by Virginia University's Expansion\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nThis article was produced for ProPublica's Local Reporting Network in partnership with the Virginia Center for Investigative Journalism at WHRO . Sign up for Dispatches to get stories like this one as soon as they are published.\n\nThe city of Newport News, Virginia, and Christopher Newport University are creating a joint task force to reexamine the destruction of a Black neighborhood to make way for the school's campus starting in the 1960s, and recommend possible redress for uprooted families.\n\nThe new commission, announced Monday, will scrutinize four decades of the school's property acquisitions, probing the decisions that led to locating and expanding its campus in the midst of a once-thriving Black community. It will also contact families displaced by Christopher Newport's steady growth to ask what \"restorative justice\" would mean for them, and seek state assistance with potential relief for victims, according to a draft action plan.\n\nThe formation of the task force follows publication of a series by the Virginia Center for Investigative Journalism at WHRO and ProPublica , which revealed that Christopher Newport and other Virginia state universities grew by decimating thriving Black communities. It also documented race-based decision-making by the City Council by locating the school in a Black neighborhood despite having cheaper options and by seizing properties by eminent domain. CNU's expansion has whittled down the Shoe Lane neighborhood in Newport News to just five houses.\n\nIn their announcement, Newport News Mayor Phillip Jones and Christopher Newport University President Bill Kelly said that the task force's goals are to develop a \"comprehensive understanding\" of historical events and to ensure that residents are treated better in the future. \"Understanding and acknowledging our past is important to moving forward in a transparent and thoughtful way. Christopher Newport is committed to this work,\" Kelly said.\n\n\"I was deeply disturbed to know that this happened in our community,\" Jones said. \"I feel a personal obligation to ensure the city speaks to its role in displacing families and disrupting the sense of community in this historic area.\"\n\nThe city will align itself with CNU's plan to boost Black enrollment, according to the draft action plan obtained by VCIJ and ProPublica. Black people make up 44% of Newport News residents but only 8% of Christopher Newport students, down from 17% in 1996, VCIJ and ProPublica reported.\n\nThe announcement marks the latest and one of the broadest efforts in the country by a university and its host city to revisit their role in urban renewal and the disruption of once-stable Black communities. City and school reexamination of the historic displacement of marginalized communities has led to greater recognition of the plight of former residents near the University of Colorado Denver and the University of Georgia in Athens. The Denver university has also established a scholarship fund for descendants of families in the displaced Aurorian community.\n\nBesides municipal and university action, the VCIJ-ProPublica series has also stirred a state legislative response. Delegate Delores McQuinn introduced legislation this month to create a commission to study how Virginia public colleges have uprooted Black communities and to explore routes of redress.\n\nThe first phase of the Newport News and CNU review will examine property records and assessments from 1958 to 1997 to determine whether property owners were properly paid for their land. The task force will also review city and university records, family archives and church documents to identify displaced families and calculate potential compensation, according to the draft action plan.\n\nAdditionally, the working group will survey affected families and consult with historians, lawyers and restorative justice experts. The task force will also suggest changes to the city's policy for using eminent domain to seize properties.\n\nThe city has not released details about how many members would be appointed to the task force, when it would be expected to conclude its work or when findings would be released.\n\nNewport News Vice Mayor Curtis Bethany and CNU Provost Quentin Kidd will co-chair the task force, which is expected to include representatives of the city, the university administration, alumni, students and the community, according to the action plan.\n\nThe ProPublica series detailed how universities have taken advantage of federal funding and court rulings to displace tens of thousands of families of color. A 1959 amendment to the Federal Housing Act gave colleges generous subsidies to join with cities to expand into stable neighborhoods, often by using eminent domain. While these efforts were promoted as ways to revitalize deteriorating neighborhoods, they frequently resulted in the destruction of Black middle-class communities. Christopher Newport and other Virginia state universities grew at the expense of Black neighborhoods.\n\nFollowing the first story in the series , Kelly acknowledged in a message to faculty and staff that the university's progress \"has come at a human cost, and we must continue to learn about and understand our complicated history.\"\n\nKelly also shared the series and a related documentary film with students, faculty and staff, and CNU hosted a panel discussion in November on its history. There, before an overflow crowd, panelists and audience members lashed out at the university. \"A school that's built on land that was taken from Black Americans should be more diverse,\" said panelist Audrey Perry Williams, president of the Hampton Roads Association for the Study of African American Life and History.\n\nAnother panelist, professor Johnny Finn, chair of the Christopher Newport sociology department, floated the idea of reparations for affected families. \"I think we need to think about materially, in addition to the symbolic and the representational, how we deal with this,\" Finn said.\n\nIn 2019, Christopher Newport implemented the Community Captains program, designed to prepare students from Newport News high schools to enter the university and increase enrollment of Black students. Other Virginia universities have taken steps to rectify the historical displacement of marginalized communities caused by their campus expansions. Beginning in the 1960s, Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, took over part of the predominantly Black Lambert's Point neighborhood. ODU has since worked to improve relations with remaining residents by increasing enrollment of students of color and awarding scholarships to residents of Lambert's Point and nearby areas. The University of Virginia, which also dislodged Black residents, appointed two executive commissions to study its historical support for racist policies and has set a goal to create affordable housing for Charlottesville residents on university-owned properties.\n\nAround 1960, the area bounded by Shoe Lane and three other streets was a growing Black middle-class neighborhood. Residents included teachers, dentists, a high school principal and a NASA engineer, and there were plans to develop farmland for additional housing. But an all-white Newport News City Council blocked those plans by seizing the core of the community in 1961 to establish a college. A former Christopher Newport University president said he was told that the goal was to \"erase the Black spot,\" in part because the area was near an all-white country club where city and business leaders gathered. The city paid the homeowners 20% less for the properties than the value set by an independent appraiser, council records show.\n\nEven after the 1960s seizure, Black families continued to live around the perimeter of the college. However, Christopher Newport kept expanding. Between 1987 and 2019, it acquired at least 70 properties in the Shoe Lane area, according to an analysis of real estate records. Contending that the university's expansion hurt their property values, because no one else would want to buy the property, homeowners unsuccessfully sued the university in federal court in 1989.\n\nRead More\n\nPaul Trible, CNU's president from 1996 to 2022, said publicly he wouldn't need to invoke eminent domain. But his administration used it as leverage to force at least one homeowner to sell in 2005, records show. That same year, the school's governing board approved its use for three other properties that Christopher Newport said it ultimately acquired without resorting to eminent domain.\n\nDwayne Johnson, who grew up on Shoe Lane, urged the task force not only to compensate families for underpayments and loss of property value but also to pay them punitive damages. Johnson's great-grandfather purchased 30 acres of land on Shoe Lane in the early 1900s.\n\n\"Do we want reparations? That would be nice,\" Johnson said. \"But do we think it will be meaningful in that it actually is reflective of our losses? I don't know.\"\n\nFiled under -\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "\"I Want the Anger to Be Your Anger\": Bringing a ProPublica Investigation From Page to Screen\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nIn 2019, I wrote a story for ProPublica, co-published with The New Yorker, about the dispossession of Black landowners in the South . The story looked at the legal obstacles that families face when they pass their land down without a will, a form of ownership known as heirs' property. Laws and loopholes allow speculators and developers, among others, to acquire the property out from under families, often at below-market rates. Black Americans lost 90% of their farmland between 1910 and 1997, and the heirs' property system is one of the primary causes.\n\nI focused on the Reels family of North Carolina, chronicling how they had lost their land to developers but refused to leave it. This land was their home, their freedom, their livelihood, their history and their legacy. They believed so deeply in their moral claim to the land that they would not accept a ruling that it no longer belonged to them. Their story of losing heirs' property is common in the South, but their determination to protest was unlike anything I had seen. Two of the brothers, Melvin Davis and Licurtis Reels, ended up spending eight years in a county jail for refusing to obey a court order to stay off the land. Their sister, Mamie Reels, and their niece, Kim Duhon, dedicated their lives to protecting the property and freeing Melvin and Licurtis.\n\nWhile I was reporting, my editor, Alexandra Zayas, suggested that ProPublica send a videographer to capture the story. For two months, Mayeta Clark filmed while I was investigating. Katie Campbell joined on a few shoots as well. By the time the story was published in July 2019, we had almost 90 hours of footage. We reached out to documentary filmmaker Raoul Peck to see if he might be interested in collaborating on the project. Born in Haiti, Peck has directed documentaries and features about subjects that include Patrice Lumumba, the first prime minister of the Republic of Congo, who was murdered with U.S. and Belgian support (\"Lumumba: Death of a Prophet\"), the rebuilding efforts in post-earthquake Haiti (\"Fatal Assistance\") and James Baldwin's unfinished manuscript on race in America (Oscar-nominated \"I Am Not Your Negro\"). I spent several months working with Peck, and then he went off to shoot and write. When he completed a script, ProPublica reviewed it to ensure its accuracy. The resulting film is \"Silver Dollar Road,\" co-produced by Velvet Film, ProPublica, JuVee Productions and Amazon MGM Studios. It will premiere this evening at the Toronto International Film Festival and will be released on Prime Video on Oct. 20. I spoke with Peck last week about the film and his process. This conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nWatch the Trailer for \"Silver Dollar Road\"\n\nThe filmmaker I always wanted to be was one who never had a plan. My way of approaching issues or subjects of film is always what, in this moment of my life, seems important, and where can I contribute. I dig into my personal history. Baldwin, Marx, remember, those are stations of my real life. So usually my projects come in a very organic way, and this one did as well.\n\nI was familiar with the topic and, of course, my blood would always boil. But I thought, \"OK, there are American filmmakers who are capable of doing this film, I don't need to immerse myself in it.\" Then this came through ProPublica, asking if I would executive produce, and I said, \"Of course,\" because I thought it was a great story. We had also found a great filmmaker, a young filmmaker, and I thought we could bring him in and allow him to make his second film. Then this filmmaker had to make another project, but by that time, I was deeply involved in it. So I said, \"You know what? I need to meet the family.\" Once I did, I decided I would direct it. I didn't look for it, I had many other offers, but I decided to do this one because there was a connection.\n\nWell, some of the cornerstones of what I do are power and abuse of power, history or \"denied history,\" and injustice. I had this feeling while reading about this family and then seeing the footage that you guys had shot that these were people I knew - that these were situations that I knew, whether through my studies, or in films or history, but also through my own experience in Haiti and Congo.\n\nAt one point, we had conversations about whether I should bring you into the film. I watched you talking to the family and I felt you were like the daughter of the house, and I didn't want to lose that - until, you know, I got to a point where I did. There was also your resistance. As a journalist, you wanted to stay a journalist, which I totally respect. You didn't want to become the subject of your own work. But I'm a filmmaker. My process is to observe, and I try to tell the narrative of my observation.\n\nBut then, when I was with the family, the effect of Mamie and Kim, these two women, was clear to me. They were the ones running the show. They were the pivotal people. They were the most courageous. They were the most clear-eyed. They were the most philosophical. Not only is Mamie all those things, but she's also funny. You could see how much she took on to be the leader. She knew she had to be the joker because she had to take everybody with her. The main characters would be Mamie and Kim, and it was great to have two different generations, two women with different educations and different ways of seeing life. They had to tell the story themselves.\n\nVery often, the studios or networks want a nice, closed-off story, where you tell the story but the subjects still stay on the other side of the fence. Where we are voyeurs, looking at the misery or the happiness or whatever it is of other people, but we don't feel that they are like us or we are like them. There was no way I was going to go there - take all these moments from this family and sell them. No. My duty as an engaged filmmaker is to make sure that I'm a vehicle bringing these voices to a loudspeaker.\n\nIn terms of my personal journey, the only one that counts is my journey of making new friends. Kim, Mamie, everybody - I feel they are my family, I feel they are friends. So I would answer your question by saying, the film I try to make is the film that uses my experience and knowledge the way I understand society today, mostly a capitalistic society, and how that society expresses itself in multiple stories. By the way, the story is the same as the one from \"I Am Not Your Negro.\" It's the same story about capitalism, racism, colonialism, exploitation, injustice. It's the same themes again and again. So I felt at home in the sense that this is a continuation of what I've been doing.\n\nI'm going to be blunt about this. I grew up with journalists. My first job when I was in university in Berlin was to take photos and do interviews and sell them to newspapers. I've seen how the profession has evolved. This desire to be \"objective\" is a trap. I claim my subjectivity in the sense that I base my films on objective matter, on solid research, empirical material, theory, etc. But then as an artist, I use my subjectivity, and I say what I have to say. That's the only way to evade the trap. At this point in the debate over truth, I must talk about what I feel and think and be transparent about it.\n\nOne of my main concerns with this film was how do I avoid the cliches - the cliches of the job as a filmmaker but also the cliches about Black people in the South. How do I give these people power? Because of the algorithms now, the streaming platforms want documentary filmmakers to tell the whole story in the first one to three minutes. But once you do that, you're basically making a product - you're not telling a very specific story that can change your mind about even the way you watch films. So if I had gone that way for an opening, it would have been just another terrible story about a Black family in the South. You would maybe see it once and then forget about it.\n\nBut I wanted to make a film where you first establish real people, people you want to watch and listen to, people you will remember. So it's a different type of construction, and I knew that it was the only way to tell the story instead of saying up front that two brothers were in jail for eight years for nothing. If you don't understand the price, the real toll on the whole family - if you can't identify with the people - you will just have pity. But I want you to have a connection, and I want the anger to be your anger about the injustice, so it's felt as an injustice to you too.\n\nExactly that. I think we made the best use of your work, Mayeta's work and my work. In this case, it was a collective. It's different, but it's still my signature.\n\nRead More\n\nIt's the themes, but another part of it is the subjectivity. You know, there are things that Mamie says that I would probably analyze differently, because I researched \"the other side,\" but this is what she thinks and she has the right to say it, because that's her life, that's what her experience tells her. So, somehow, I gave her my own personal subjectivity. She is the one taking my place. Usually, my films are more conceptual, and there is a voice-over that I write. But here, it was mostly their interviews that I used as the material of the dramatic narration. It's not unlike what I did in \"I Am Not Your Negro.\" I had to come to the same humbled attitude - to say, \"No, it's Baldwin's film. He is the one talking and I'm just helping.\" I'm a maker-translator, but I have to be in the background.\n\nI said I'm a realist.\n\nIn the film, Mamie says, \"What are you going to do with us, poor people?\" I can use that phrase in France, in Germany, in the United States, in Congo. That's a central question. I don't feel like the film is about the past or what happened over the past eight years. It's really a confrontation with today.\n\nActually, Mamie first says, \"What are you going to do with Black people?\" Then she corrects herself and says, \"What are you going to do with us, poor people?\" And that's a class analysis. Those, for me, are great moments, where Mamie is more than Mamie. Those are the moments that will stick. The moments that are provocative. Mamie isn't reciting. She's in it. It comes from her.\n\nLizzie Presser covers health, inequality and how policy is experienced for ProPublica.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "ProPublica logo\n\nA ProPublica analysis found that black people and Native Americans are under-represented in clinical trials of new drugs, even when the treatment is aimed at a type of cancer that disproportionately affects them.\n\nby Caroline Chen and Riley Wong\n\nThis story was co-published with Stat .\n\nIt's a promising new drug for multiple myeloma, one of the most savage blood cancers. Called Ninlaro, it can be taken as a pill, sparing patients painful injections or cumbersome IV treatments. In a video sponsored by the manufacturer, Takeda Pharmaceutical Co., one patient even hailed Ninlaro as \"my savior.\"\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved it in 2015 after patients in a clinical trial gained an average of six months without their cancer spreading. That trial, though, had a major shortcoming: its racial composition. One out of five people diagnosed with multiple myeloma in the U.S. is black, and African Americans are more than twice as likely as white Americans to be diagnosed with the blood cancer.\n\nYet of the 722 participants in the trial, only 13 - or 1.8 percent - were black.\n\nThe scarcity of black patients in Ninlaro's testing left unanswered the vital question of whether the drug would work equally well for them. \"Meaningful differences may exist\" in how multiple myeloma affects black patients, what symptoms they experience and how they respond to medications, FDA scientists wrote in a 2017 journal article.\n\nThe racial disparity in the Ninlaro study isn't unusual. Reflecting the reluctance of the FDA to force drugmakers to enroll more minority patients, and the failure of most manufacturers to do so voluntarily, stark under-representation of African Americans is widespread in clinical trials for cancer drugs, even when the type of cancer disproportionately affects them. A ProPublica analysis of data recently made public by the FDA found that in trials for 24 of the 31 cancer drugs approved since 2015, fewer than 5 percent of the patients were black. African-Americans make up 13.4 percent of the U.S. population.\n\nLoading...\n\nAs a result, desperately ill black patients who have exhausted other treatment options aren't getting early access to experimental drugs that could extend their life spans or improve their quality of life. While unapproved treatments also carry a risk of setbacks or side effects, new cancer drugs have dramatically shifted outcomes for some patients.\n\nRecently approved lung cancer treatments are \"revolutionary,\" said Dr. Karen Kelly, associate director for research at UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center. Even in the first phase of clinical testing, which is aimed at making sure a drug is safe, 20 percent of cancer patients now see their tumors shrink or disappear, up from 5 percent in the early 1990s, Kelly said.\n\nDr. Kashif Ali, research head at Maryland Oncology Hematology, has spent seven years recruiting patients for about 30 cancer and blood disease trials a year. He said he's often seen minorities, including African Americans, miss out on trials because of financial hurdles, logistical challenges and their lingering distrust of the medical community due to a history of being victimized by medical experimentation.\n\n\"They're potentially losing out on life-extending opportunities because it's one more option they no longer have,\" Ali said. \"Especially when patients are in advanced stages of cancer, treatments are like stepping stones: When one stops working, you move on to the next.\"\n\nNot joining a trial can mean \"you've lost life expectancy,\" he said.\n\nPat Conley, a 72-year-old retired business analyst whose multiple myeloma relapsed last year, has never participated in a clinical trial. She was interested several times and didn't meet the criteria. Now she's eligible for one, but worries about the burden of regular hourlong trips from her Fayetteville, Georgia, home to the trial site in Atlanta, as well as the copays for medical tests. \"They'll want a new biopsy and Lordy, biopsies are not cheap,\" she said.\n\nStill, two drug regimens haven't halted her cancer and she wants something positive to come from her illness. \"If they don't have African Americans to test it on, how will they know it's going to work?\" she asked. \"If it doesn't help me, it'll help my children, it'll help somebody else.\"\n\nIf you're considering whether to enroll in a trial of an experimental drug, here's what you need to know.\n\nPharmaceutical companies contacted by ProPublica all said diversity in clinical trials is important to ensure that drugs meet patients' needs. The issue \"is not elevated high enough in the discussion on clinical studies,\" said John Maraganore, chair of the industry group Biotechnology Innovation Organization. But he added that enrolling minorities is challenging, often for reasons beyond the manufacturer's control, and that it would require a \"public-private partnership, working with the FDA and NIH [National Institutes of Health].\"\n\nBlack participation reached 10 percent in trials for only two of the 31 cancer drugs: the multiple myeloma drug Darzalex, where the figure was exactly 10 percent, and Yondelis, which treats two types of soft tissue cancer. Twelve percent of patients in the Yondelis trial were black, the highest proportion in the ProPublica study. Both drugs are made by Johnson & Johnson, which said it has an internal working group on trial diversity. The working group trains site leaders in best practices for diverse recruitment and seeks minority physicians to help run trials, since some patients prefer being treated by doctors of their own race.\n\nNot enrolling in clinical trials is just one of many ways that African Americans trail white Americans in the quality of their health care. From diagnosis to death, they often experience inferior care and worse outcomes. Because some black Americans can't afford the health insurance mandated under the Affordable Care Act, they remain less likely to have coverage than non-Hispanic white Americans. African Americans are 30 percent more likely than white Americans to die from heart disease. Black mothers are three to four times as likely as white mothers to die in pregnancy or childbirth , and black children are diagnosed with autism later than white children.\n\nSubscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\nWhile the scarcity of African Americans stands out in ProPublica's analysis, there appear to be gaps in participation of other minority groups as well. Asians were well represented in trials held in some foreign countries, but they made up only 1.7 percent of patients for drugs for which at least 70 percent of trials were conducted within the U.S. By comparison, about 6 percent of the U.S. population identifies as Asian. Almost two-thirds of the trials didn't report any Native Americans or Alaska Natives, who together make up about 2 percent of the U.S. population. ProPublica's analysis excluded Hispanics, because the FDA reports did not have a separate category for them until 2017 and do not distinguish between white and non-white Hispanics.\n\nThe very relationship of race to drug development is fraught with controversy. Race is primarily seen as a social concept, rather than as a product of measurable biological traits. Yet there's growing evidence that, whether for environmental or genetic reasons, drugs may have different effects on different populations.\n\nIn 2014, the state of Hawaii sued Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Sanofi, the manufacturers of the blood thinner Plavix, accusing them of deceptive marketing for failing to disclose that the drug was less effective for some patients of East Asian or Pacific Islander descent. The drugmakers have denied allegations of misconduct and argue that genetic traits have not been proven to affect how well Plavix works. The case is pending. In the meantime, the FDA has added a warning to the label saying that Chinese patients are more likely to have a gene variation that renders the drug ineffective. Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco have found that a commonly used asthma medication, albuterol, doesn't work as well for African-American and Puerto Rican children as it does for European American or Mexican children.\n\nInadequate minority representation in drug trials means that \"we aren't doing good science,\" said Dr. Jonathan Jackson, founding director of the Community Access, Recruitment and Engagement Research Center at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. \"If we aren't doing good science and releasing these drugs out into the public, then we are at best being inefficient, at worst being irresponsible.\"\n\nThe National Black Church Initiative, a coalition of 34,000 U.S. churches, urged the FDA in 2017 to mandate diversity in all clinical trials before approving a drug or device. \"Simply put, the pharmaceutical community is not going to improve minority participation in clinical trials until the FDA compels them to do so via regulations,\" it wrote to Commissioner Scott Gottlieb.\n\nThe FDA hasn't done so. Although it noted in a 2013 report that a lack of diversity betrays a key ethical principle of medical research - equal justice for all - the agency has shied away from setting quotas or numerical guidelines for participation by race.\n\nInstead, it has relied on persuasion. In its 2014 Action Plan , it said it aims to \"share best practices,\" to \"support\" industry efforts at improving diversity in clinical trials, and to \"encourage\" patients to participate in trials via social media, emails and blog posts.\n\nAn in-depth look at newly approved cancer drugs, who participates in their clinical trials and who is affected by those cancers.\n\n\"The FDA believes that enrollment should reflect the patients most likely to use a medical product,\" spokeswoman Gloria Sanchez-Contreras said. The FDA \"does not have the regulatory authority to require specific levels of minority representation in clinical trials,\" although it may ask drugmakers for additional data, she said.\n\nDr. Rachel Sherman, the FDA's principal deputy commissioner, said that she's \"not entirely satisfied\" with minority enrollment but that clinical trials have become more diverse in other ways. Two decades ago, women and children were rarely included in drug studies. Now those groups are better represented and the FDA is working on including more minorities, she said.\n\nSherman added that the agency has to balance how much information it demands from drugmakers against the need to get a drug onto the market, where it will be broadly available for all patients.\n\n\"When it comes to clinical research in this country, there's a credit card, and there's a limit on the credit card,\" she said. \"If we spend on one thing, it won't get spent on another. We have to be judicious in what we require and what we demand and what we encourage.\"\n\nDiversity has its trade-offs. Clinical trials already cost hundreds of millions of dollars, and drugmakers say that requiring participants to be racially representative would likely add more time and expense.\n\n\"If you have a significant delay in enrollment, that would delay the medication advancing to the whole patient population, hurting everybody including the black population,\" said Maraganore, who is also CEO of drugmaker Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc.\n\nTo offset costs caused by these delays, manufacturers might reduce the number of drugs in development, depriving some patients of experimental treatments, or raise prices, which would translate into higher insurance premiums and make new drugs even less affordable for the uninsured. Maraganore favors improving diversity through patient education - \"a carrot-based approach\" - rather than government regulation.\n\nDespite these short-term expenses, eliminating racial disparities in clinical trials would ultimately save costs through disease prevention and improved treatment, according to a 2015 analysis by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco. Without FDA pressure, though, manufacturers may be unlikely to increase efforts to recruit African Americans, especially if their sights are set on a worldwide market. They can use the same clinical trial data to gain approval in the European Union, or Japan.\n\nTakeda, which is based in Tokyo, Japan, tested Ninlaro in the U.S., Japan and 24 other countries, including Australia, Austria, Denmark, New Zealand, Sweden and others with small black populations. \"Clinical trials are reflective of the ethnicity distribution in the population where the study takes place,\" Phil Rowlands, head of Takeda's oncology unit, said in an email. \"While we cannot control enrollment eligibility based on the strict clinical criteria, our recruitment efforts extend to diverse patient populations, including minorities.\"\n\nAsked why Takeda didn't pick sites with higher black populations, Rowlands said that Takeda does not \"select sites with ethnicity as an eligibility criteria unless specific risk factors require that.\"\n\nIncome is another reason for sparse African-American representation. Clinical trials are largely a middle-class option. A 2015 study found that patients with an annual household income below $50,000 had 32 percent lower odds of participating in a trial than patients with income above that threshold. The median household income of African Americans in 2016 was $39,490, compared to $65,041 for non-Hispanic white Americans.\n\nPatients who can't afford to travel long distances to a trial, take time off work or find child care are at a disadvantage. They are usually reimbursed for travel and food costs, but drugmakers are careful not to pay too much because they do not want to appear to be enticing patients to join when it isn't in their medical interests, said Laurie Halloran, founder and CEO of a consulting firm for the drug industry.\n\nWhile the experimental drug used in a study is free, any approved treatments that are part of the trial typically need to be covered by a patient's own insurance, according to Ali, the research director at Maryland Hematology Oncology.\n\nHe recalled one black patient who was eligible for a study that entailed taking an already approved drug in combination with a new treatment. The approved drug cost $10,000 a month and the patient's insurance charged 20 percent as his copayment, Ali recalled. The patient decided that joining the trial would be too expensive. He instead underwent chemotherapy, which was cheaper, but he didn't tolerate it well. The patient is now considering hospice, Ali said.\n\nCriteria for admission to clinical trials have become more stringent over the years, Mass. General's Jackson said, and patients of color are increasingly excluded. They are more likely than white people to have other conditions such as stroke, hypertension and diabetes, which could complicate research results. Trials often want to enroll \"the healthiest sick people they can find\" and preclude patients with other conditions. \"The wall basically gets taller and taller,\" he said.\n\nAredia Taylor didn't qualify on other grounds. A former U.S. Department of Agriculture supervisor for food safety inspections, she was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2014 and has undergone a gamut of treatment including various chemotherapy drugs and a stem cell transplant.\n\nWhile the transplant drove her cancer into remission, there is no cure for multiple myeloma, and she needs to take Revlimid - a standard treatment - daily to keep the cancer at bay. The drug has given her side effects that she describes as devastating to her daily life, including diarrhea, muscle spasms and an inability to concentrate. She said she wants to stop taking Revlimid and would be willing to try an experimental treatment.\n\nTaylor, 58, said she saw pamphlets at her doctor's office encouraging patients to ask about clinical trials, so she asked her oncologist, Dr. Larry Anderson at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, whether she should join a study. He told her that she \"wasn't a fit,\" she said. Anderson told ProPublica that most trials are seeking patients with either newly diagnosed or relapsed multiple myeloma, and since Taylor is currently in remission, she wouldn't be accepted.\n\nTaylor was disappointed. Knowing that African Americans like herself are especially susceptible to multiple myeloma, she'd like to be a part of developing more effective treatments.\n\n\"I want to pay it forward and be a blessing to somebody else,\" she said. \"I want to be one of the people that they try to do a clinical trial for, so they find a way to a cure.\"\n\nSpurred by Congress , the FDA began in January 2015 to regularly publish a \"Drug Trials Snapshot\" for every new drug approved, delineating the demographic breakdown for clinical trial participants by sex, race and age subgroups. ProPublica's analysis focused on participants in trials for the 31 cancer drugs approved since then, comparing their demographics with data from the National Cancer Institute on the incidence of various cancers by race.\n\nEighteen of those drugs targeted cancers that are at least as likely to afflict black Americans as white Americans. On average, only 4.1 percent of patients in those trials were black. Trials for four multiple myeloma drugs, including Ninlaro, averaged 5 percent black participation.\n\nLoading...\n\nAn FDA study over a longer time period corroborated ProPublica's findings. In a 2017 article in the journal Blood co-authored by Richard Pazdur, the FDA's cancer chief, the agency reported that black patients on average made up 4.5 percent of participants in trials for multiple myeloma drugs since 2003. Higher enrollment of minorities in myeloma trials would have \"multiple benefits,\" the FDA scientists noted. Not only would \"underserved populations\" gain access to new therapies, but additional data could help researchers identify subtypes of the blood cancer and develop targeted treatments.\n\nA similar pattern emerges for treatments of non-small cell lung cancer. It occurs in 56 out of 100,000 black Americans, versus 49 out of 100,000 white Americans. Yet ProPublica found that in trials for two recently approved drugs for a type of non-small cell lung cancer driven by a mutation in what is known as the ALK gene, less than 2 percent of participants were black.\n\nThose drugs, Takeda's Alunbrig and Genentech's Alecensa, are approved for patients whose lung cancer has spread to other parts of the body. In trials, both drugs were able to shrink tumors, including lesions in the brain. Patients taking Alecensa lived without the disease progressing for an average of 25.7 months, more than double the 10.4 months for patients on another treatment.\n\n\"We believe that we must consider differences across all populations to deliver on the promise of personalized health care,\" said Meghan Cox, a Genentech spokeswoman, adding that the drugmaker is \"continuing to study patient response to Alecensa across populations in the post-marketing setting.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nSimilarly, prostate cancer affects 178 out of every 100,000 African Americans, more than for any other race in the U.S., compared to 106 out of every 100,000 white Americans. Black Americans are twice as likely as white Americans to die from prostate cancer.\n\nYet from 2009 to 2015, in seven trials conducted for five new prostate cancer therapies, only 3 percent of participants were black, according to a study conducted by Dr. Daniel Spratt, vice chair of research for the department of radiation oncology at the University of Michigan. More recently, 11 times as many white as black participants - or 66 percent compared to 6 percent - joined trials for Johnson & Johnson's new prostate cancer treatment, Erleada.\n\nThe FDA approved Erleada in February after trials showed patients on the drug lived an average of two years longer without their cancer spreading into other organs than if they were taking a placebo. In a J&J press release, physicians hailed Erleada's \"impressive clinical benefits\" for prostate cancer patients.\n\nJ&J is \"confident in the efficacy and safety data that have supported the approval\" of Erleada, J&J spokeswoman Satu Glawe said.\n\nLoading...\n\nLike Genentech, J&J and Takeda said they track drugs after approval to see if any racial differences emerge. For example, after another J&J drug for prostate cancer, Zytiga, went on the market in 2011, the company ran a new study of 100 patients, 50 black and 50 white.\n\n\"We were aware of the low number of African American men\" in the pre-approval drug studies of Zytiga, Glawe said. The post-marketing study was intended \"to ensure the medication was also providing clinical benefit to these patients.\" In fact, it showed that black men responded better than white men to the drug.\n\nThe FDA is able to look for signs that an approved drug isn't helping a specific population through a surveillance system launched in 2016, called Sentinel, which provides access to medical claims and other data on 200 million Americans obtained from insurers and other health providers, Sherman, the FDA's principal deputy commissioner, said.\n\nStill, post-marketing surveillance doesn't compensate for lack of diversity in clinical trials. Minorities still miss out on experimental treatments - and, if they take a drug once it's approved, may suffer unanticipated side effects.\n\nLeaving analysis of a drug's effect on minorities until it's already on the market is \"a hubristic assumption, unnecessarily arrogant,\" Jackson said. Drugs should \"work for the individuals who are the most vulnerable,\" he said. \"That necessarily includes racial and ethnic minorities.\"\n\nLike African Americans, Native Americans rarely enroll in clinical trials. Among the drug trials analyzed by ProPublica, 64.5 percent did not report any Native American participants, even for types of cancer that Native Americans get at similar rates as other races. (It's possible that some Native Americans were enrolled but lumped into a generic \"other\" category.)\n\nNative Americans are at higher risk of colorectal cancer than white or Asian Americans. Yet the drugmaker Taiho Oncology didn't report a single Native American among the 800 participants in its trials for the colorectal cancer treatment Lonsurf. Taiho didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nLoading...\n\nTo understand how a small minority group responds to a drug, researchers might have to enroll more patients than what would be a nationally representative sample. In a trial of 100 people, two Native American or Alaska Native patients would reflect those groups' proportion of the U.S. population, but wouldn't give doctors enough information about race-related impacts.\n\nDr. Linda Burhansstipanov, founder of the Native American Cancer Research Corporation, estimated that 85 percent of Native Americans want to participate in clinical trials when informed of the opportunity. She knows several Native American patients who drove three hours each way to participate in a trial, despite losing an entire day of work.\n\nStill, trial protocols are rarely designed with minority communities in mind, Burhansstipanov said. It has long been rumored among Native Americans, she said, that a clinical trial in the 1990s required patients to take a medication upon rising in the morning. In many Native American tribes, the first thing people do when they wake up is greet the sun with morning prayers. For some tribes, prayers can take more than half an hour. Because of the delay, the tale goes, Native American patients were kicked out of the clinical trial for violating the protocol. \"The story spread and became a barrier for people to take part in clinical trials,\" she said.\n\nIn addition, the history of unscrupulous medical experimentation on minorities feeds wariness of clinical trials. Angela Marshall, an internal medicine doctor and board member of Black Women's Health Imperative , said she sees a \"lack of excitement among minority communities for clinical trials, coming from a mistrust of the medical community.\"\n\nGet the data behind this investigation from the ProPublica Data Store.\n\nHer black patients often cite the infamous Tuskegee study , conducted from 1932 to 1972 by the U.S. Public Health Service, in which researchers knowingly withheld treatment from African American sharecroppers with syphilis in order to study the progression of the disease. Some Native Americans are similarly suspicious of the medical community, Burhansstipanov said, because the Indian Health Service (a unit of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services) sterilized thousands of Native American women in the 1970s without their consent.\n\n\"The medical community has to engage in some serious trust-building initiatives,\" Marshall said.\n\nThat trust is what has helped to keep Thomas Goode alive. An African American diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2005 when he was 34, Goode has endured three stem cell transplants. In between each transplant, he participated in clinical trials, where he gained access to drug cocktails that helped bridge him to the next procedure. He counted himself lucky that he lived close to Durham, North Carolina, which is a research hub, so he was able to see specialists and take part in trials.\n\n\"I never knew anything about clinical trials, but a lot of my trust and faith was in the doctor,\" he said. \"I said, 'I trust you, doctor, whatever you say.'\"\n\nNow, Goode has gone six years without a relapse. \"I'm in a good place right now,\" he said, \"But if I didn't try a trial, who's to say I would still be here?\"\n\nStat is a news organization reporting from the frontiers of health and medicine.
