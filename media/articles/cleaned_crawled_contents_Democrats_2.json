REUTERS/Jim Vondruska\n\nI've asked this question before. Now I'm SHOUTING it.\n\nWhere the HELL are the Democrats?\n\nIt should be the Democrats' moment - the time when Democrats are everywhere, on everyone's lips, in everyone's eyes.\n\nBut Democrats are nowhere. AWOL. Almost invisible.\n\nThey're squandering this opportunity.\n\nCan you imagine a more important moment for Democrats to sound the alarm? At the request of a Republican president, the richest person in the world is taking a sledgehammer to Social Security, Medicaid, Veterans Affairs, the entire Department of Education, and much else that Americans need and want.\n\nHe's doing all this so the president can give a huge tax cut to the wealthiest members of our society and the biggest corporations in America.\n\nWorse, the president chose this man for this job because he sank a quarter of a billion dollars into getting the president elected. And this man, already one of the government's biggest contractors, is salivating over the prospect of turning even more of government into his or other corporate hands.\n\nIt's everything Democrats could possibly want - the prime example of America's raging inequality and the corruption it has spawned; the disgusting power of huge wealth and of the giant corporations it controls; billionaires running Washington; a tsunami of big money and legalized bribery.\n\nAll the while, average Americans, whose real wages have gone nowhere, are being shafted.\n\nThat same Republican president is turning himself into a dictator - usurping authority that the founders vested in Congress to decide what to fund. Threatening judges who are trying to constrain him and urging their impeachment - even eliciting a rebuke from the chief justice of the Supreme Court. Attacking freedom of speech at American universities, in the media, in science and the arts, among law firms and lawyers who have tried to hold him accountable.\n\nOn top of all of this is the regime's utter incompetence (e.g.: \"Signalgate\").\n\nThis isn't what Americans who voted for Trump wanted. Most voted for him because they thought he'd fix the economy and lower prices.\n\nBut the economy is going to s---. Consumer confidence has fallen to the lowest level in 12 years. Signs point to a coming recession.\n\nDemocrats should be all over this - stopping all official action until they get answers to what's happening and why, not allowing a thing to move through Congress, yelling from the roof beams of the Capitol, conducting rallies across America. YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN INEQUALITY GETS OUT OF CONTROL? WHEN THE BILLIONAIRES ARE PUT IN CHARGE? WHEN BIG CORPORATIONS AND BIG MONEY TAKE OVER FUNCTIONS OF GOVERNMENT?\n\nA Fox News poll published last week found that 56 percent of voters think that \"the job the Trump administration is doing identifying and cutting wasteful government spending\" is \"poor\" or \"only fair\" and 65 percent say they are \"extremely\" or \"very\" concerned that \"not enough thought and planning has gone into the government spending cuts.\"\n\nDemocrats! Some 34,000 people just turned out at Civic Center Park in Denver to hear Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in a \"Fighting Oligarchy Tour.\" Hours later, the two spoke before a crowd of about 11,000 at the University of Northern Colorado in Greeley.\n\nSanders and AOC lashed out at the most extreme concentration of wealth in a century, at Wall Street's greed, at corporate welfare. They pushed for a wealth tax to finance better schools, paid family leave, free public university education, universal health care.\n\nThis is what Americans want and need.\n\nOn Tuesday, Democrats flipped a Trump-voting seat in the Pennsylvania state Senate. \"This is how it's done,\" celebrated AOC. \"Run everywhere. Run down-ballot. Focus on local elections ASAP ... We build from there.\"\n\nYet some Democratic political operatives counsel Democrats to \"play dead.\" Let Trump and the Republicans overreach, they say. Give them enough rope to figuratively hang themselves. Besides, the midterm elections aren't until November of 2026. Keep your powder dry.\n\nRubbish. Tens of millions of Americans believe there's no real Democratic opposition to Trump. They hear and see nothing. They feel demoralized and defeated. With the Democrats playing doorstops, many voters worry there might not even be free and fair elections the next time around.\n\nDemocrats are now less popular even than Trump: An NBC News poll this month found that while Trump has a 47 percent approval rating, Democrats are a whopping 20 percentage points behind him.\n\nDemocrats! Get yourselves out of Washington and talk to the people!\n\nExplain why so many people are struggling - not because of immigrants or the \"deep state\" or any other Trump bogeyman but because of how the wealthy and giant corporations have rigged the economy, and how Trump and Musk are rigging even more of it.\n\nBe loud! Condemn what's happening! Run everywhere! Run down-ballot!\n\nGet yourself a new generation of Democratic leaders! (I have standing to say this at the ripe old age of 78.)\n\nMake good trouble! Rally Americans! Give them hope! Give Trump hell!\n\nRobert Reich is a professor of public policy at Berkeley and former secretary of labor.

REUTERS/Nathan Howard\n\nAfter the recent debacle over a government funding bill that split the Senate Democratic Caucus, the minority party in the upper chamber of Congress is aiming to solidify their opposition ahead of a summer deadline - and they may end up putting Republicans on the defensive.\n\nSemafor reported Tuesday that Democrats are now putting pressure on party leadership in Congress to be willing to take a firm stance as the U.S. government approaches its debt limit. According to the Bipartisan Policy Center , the debt ceiling will need to be raised sometime between July and October if the U.S. hopes to avoid defaulting on its debt. Now, Republicans are debating whether to put a debt ceiling increase in their massive $4.6 trillion tax cut bill (which is President Donald Trump's preferred approach) or to attempt bipartisan negotiations with Democrats.\n\nIt remains an open question of whether Democrats are willing to put the debt ceiling on the line during upcoming negotiations. Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) - who was one of the few Senate Democrats who voted with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) to pass the House Republican government funding bill - told Semafor that when it comes to the debt ceiling, he \"refuse[s] to take a hostage like that.\"\n\nBut others are more willing to take that risk. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) insisted that Democrats \"will need a strategy, and we will need to be unified,\" adding: \"We have leverage. And we should use it.\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) was skeptical that Democrats should entertain extending Trump's tax cuts (that primarily benefit the wealthiest Americans ) just to raise the debt ceiling.\n\n\"Why should we do that?\" Warren told Semafor. \"I want to know what the Republicans are offering. They seem to think they can run this government with no help from the Democrats. Let's watch them do it.\"\n\nBecause the United States is a currency-issuing country, it's impossible for the government to ever run out of money. However, raising the debt ceiling is important for institutional investors and international governments that park their money in the form of U.S. Treasury securities, which are guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government (and constitute the vast bulk of the  $36 trillion national debt ). If Congress failed to raise the debt ceiling and defaulted on its debt, it would mean that the tens of trillions of dollars in Treasury securities are no longer guaranteed, which could destabilize the global economy. Elizabeth Pancotti, who is a former advisor to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), suggested that the debt ceiling negotiations could end up being a powerful arrow in Democrats' quiver.\n\n\"[Democrats] seem to get more p---ed every day,\" Pancotti said. \"Obviously, default is bad; avoiding default is good - but there does come a breaking point.\""

REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein\n\nThe Democrats showed their disapproval of Trump's Tuesday night speech to Congress, and MAGA is having a \"full-blown meltdown,\" the Daily Beast reported on Wednesday.\n\nDemocrats held up signs, declined to clap and wore pink in protest. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) wrote notes on a white board. Rep. Al Green (D-Tex.) was removed after he stood up and yelled.\n\n\"Has there ever been a more disgraceful and pitiful and malicious display in politics than Congressional Democrats refusing to stand for heartbroken families and courageous heroes?\" White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy Stephen Miller asked on X .\n\n\"Democrats showed whose side they're on - and it's not the American people,\" the White House said in a statement .\n\nThe White House statement quoted Dana Perino on Fox News . \"The Democratic Party still has no common sense. They have no ideas and they have no heart. They couldn't even stand for the most inspiring moments of the speech,\" she said. Perino was White House press secretary under George W. Bush.\n\nThe statement then listed 35 bullet points of points where the Democrats did not applaud. They included \"declaring America's youth are perfect as God made them,\" \"removing illegal alien killers, rapists, and drug dealers from our streets\" and simply \"The United States of America.\"\n\nSome members of Trump world were incensed that Democrats did not cheer for Trump making 13-year-old cancer survivor DJ Daniel an honorary Secret Service agent.\n\n\"Democrats reminded us they are the party of insanity and hate - they could not even clap for a child battling cancer, or mothers who lost their children,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt posted on X .\n\nDonald Trump Jr. wrote a similar sentiment on X . \"If you can't stand up and cheer for a kid with brain cancer being made an honorary member of the Secret Service, then you might be a deeply disturbed and f---ed up person!!!\" he wrote.\n\n\"If you didn't stand up and applaud this young cancer survivor and his amazing father, there's something really sick and messed up about you,\" conservative commentator Charlie Kirk posted on X early Wednesday , echoing Trump Jr. and Leavitt.\n\nTrump advisor Elon Musk took issue with one moment where the Democrats did applaud - when the president said that the U.S. has sent hundreds of billions of dollars to support Ukraine.\n\n\"The only flag being waved and the ONLY cheer by Democrats was for another country, he posted on his website . \"They hate America,\" he added.\n\nSome Democrats addressed the lack of applause.\n\n\"Mr. President, we would all applaud if you found cures to horrific diseases.\" Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.) wrote on X . \"But how do you expect to accomplish that when you're cutting funding from the NIH?\"\n\n\"There's no standing ovation for cutting funding for cancer research, stripping Medicaid, and raising costs for working people,\" Rep.

      "text": "Democrats aren't in disarray - but the Democratic Party is\n\nU.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) speaks to the media, on the day of a Senate Democrats' weekly policy lunch on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., February 19, 2025.\n\nIt's important you understand that the controversy over US Senator Chuck Schumer's continued leadership of the Senate Democrats is not an ordinary \"family feud,\" or a narrative about the establishment versus \"the left,\" or some media fiction about \"Democrats in disarray.\"\n\nIn leading eight other Senate Democrats to voting last week in favor of the GOP funding bill, Schumer cemented the already deep public impression that the Democrats will collapse under pressure and that the party of \"kitchen-table issues\" can't be trusted to implement them, even if it has an opportunity to, because it's too spineless and weak.\n\nWhile it's true that liberals tend to be like cats, and that herding them tends to be virtually impossible, the problem facing the Democrats isn't one of ideology or interest. It's about that fighting spirit and whether their leaders possess it. It's about showing the American people, especially Democratic voters , that the Democrats have what it takes to resist and counterpunch the tyranny of a criminal president.\n\nAs Garrett Graff said : \"In effectively a single blink of the historical eye, we've seen our entire constitutional system simply ... stop. We can clearly see what's happening is wrong - illegal and unconstitutional - and the actors who can do something about that just ... aren't.\"\n\nThis is why this whole thing is more than \"Democrats in disarray.\" (If it were, I wouldn't be talking about it for the fifth time.) What would it take to demonstrate that the Democrats are strong and that they can be relied on to act when the moment for action arrives? Given that they are the party out of power, the only thing they can do now is get their house in order, which is to say, hold themselves accountable.\n\nThat means getting rid of Schumer as leader .\n\nThe man can't be trusted. This is clear for reasons beyond last week's vote. Last night, during an interview with MSNBC's Chris Hayes , in which he defended his vote, he pushed primary responsibility for the defense of democracy and the rule of law onto the American people.\n\nIf Trump disobeys the US Supreme Court, Schumer said, \"there will be a strong and immediate reaction from one end of the country to the other in ways that we have never seen before. ... It's not just up to us. The people will have to rise up. ... Our democracy will be at stake then. ... If the people make their voices heard, and stand up, and we join them, I believe we can try to beat that back, we can beat that back.\"\n\nThis is the same belief in the inherent goodness of the American people that made it possible, after the 2020 election, for some elite Democrats to wave away critics who demanded that then-Attorney General Merrick Garland immediately hold accountable every single Republican involved in the J6 insurrection, including Donald Trump.\n\nThis belief in the inherent goodness of the American people made it possible to accept the argument that the Biden administration didn't need to risk alienating swing voters by pursuing justice, but instead could beat the next GOP nominee with appeals to economic policies.\n\nIf the last election taught us anything, it's that the American people cannot altogether tell the difference between chicken salad and chicken shit, but here's a Democratic leader telling us not only that the American people will recognize tyranny when they see but also that his party will join them after they have seen it for themselves. What they need is leadership, but there isn't any among the Democrats.\n\nThe most obvious reason Schumer can't be trusted?\n\nHe still trusts the Republicans.\n\nIn their new book, Times reporters Annie Karni and Luke Broadwater said that in the summer of 2023, Schumer told them over glasses of wine that after the election, \"when the Republican party expels the turd of Donald Trump, it will go back to being the old Republican party.\"\n\nIf there's a way to blame Trump for the GOP's problems, Schumer will find it before blaming the GOP itself. As Jeet Heer said last week , he explained to the Times that his strategy \"is to wait until Trump's approval rating goes under 40 percent, which will create a new political environment where Senate Republicans will turn on Trump.\"\n\nThe Republicans will never turn on Trump, no matter how unpopular he becomes. Meanwhile, rank-and-file Republicans, as well as swing voters, will not necessarily turn to the Democrats for solutions to the problems his administration creates, not when there's a national consensus that the Democrats are soft, and not when there's always a third-party scammer waiting to take advantage of the alienated.\n\nWhat can be trusted about Schumer?\n\nHis weakness is provocative. According to Rolling Stone , \"multiple senior GOP sources in both chambers on the Hill and within the Trump administration were quick to blab to Rolling Stone about how thrilled they were at Schumer's willingness to cave - because they now believe they can get away with the same tactics in the next funding showdown and exclude Democrats from the process.\"\n\nIf only this were a story about \"Democrats in disarray.\"\n\nIf that were the case, there would be a competitive faction inside the party that understands the immediate need to demonstrate lasting accountability. (It's not enough to keep saying, over and over, that we gotta do better. Heads must roll!) It would understand the immediate need to demonstrate strength and courage for the purpose of winning back public trust, especially the trust of rank-and-file Democrats.\n\nThat's not the case, because the Democrats - and I mean all of them, not just Chuck Schumer - continue to take the base of the party for granted. They assume, as they did when they forced Joe Biden out of the running, that the base will go along with whatever they decide, even if that decision means caving to Republicans without getting anything in return, except the shattered faith of the Democratic base.\n\nThe Democrats take the base for granted because, unlike the Republicans, they do not fear it. Because they do not, it's unlikely that they will hold Schumer responsible for his backstabbing. Indeed, top Democrats will tacitly approve of his strategy of waiting and waiting and waiting for the Republicans to turn on Trump, sacrificing their power in the mistaken belief that they will be rewarded for it, all the while wondering why normie Democrats are increasingly awol."

      "text": "'Ignorance, bigotry and authoritarianism': Here's why Democrats are switching off the news\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt takes questions during her first daily briefing at the White House in Washington, U.S. January 28, 2025.\n\nMany Democrats appear to be switching off mainstream news channels and other media, following Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nAround 72% of Democrats say they feel a need to limit their consumption of news about politics and government, according to a recent poll by AP-NORC.\n\nResearch has highlighted the negative effects of news avoidance (resistance to, or avoidance of, news) on people's political knowledge and civic engagement , the cornerstones of democratic thought and action.\n\nResearch also shows what prompts news avoidance generally - and the return of Trump may be increasing the percentage of people in the US who are turning away from news and current affairs.\n\nResearch from the University of Jyvaskyla in Finland measured how news avoidance varied across several nations between 2016 and 2019. It also attempted to identify the drivers of news avoidance.\n\nResearchers found the proportion of consumers who actively avoided the news varied significantly from one country to another - and for some, it was temporary.\n\nIn their sample of five countries, they found news avoidance was highest in Argentina (45%) and the US (41%) and lowest in Finland (17%) and Japan (11%), with Israel somewhere in between. The US, it seems, has always been high but there are some suggestions it is getting worse.\n\nPeople made conscious decisions about what news to consume and what to avoid, given the amount of news available. News overload and cognitive fatigue (where people feel worn out by the amount of news they feel they should listen to) were especially important when there was intense national news focus on certain individuals. Examples of this could be coverage of the corruption case involving Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel , or Trump's recent stream of executive orders .\n\nBut factors can vary. The study found that in Japan, the main cognitive driver was \"a reluctance to discuss or be exposed to subjective and often extreme opinions\". In Argentina, it was a distrust of politicians generally.\n\nHowever, emotional factors were also critical to news avoidance. Many interviewees reported feeling emotional distress, sadness, fear and anger with certain types of negative news, to the extent that it sometimes affected their mental health .\n\nBut emotional factors also affect specific behaviour. News avoidance can become \"news aversion\" (more emotional, more visceral), turning away from the news not because of some deliberate rational judgment (\"I'll reduce my viewing a little, according to American Psychological Association guidelines\") but because of overwhelming feelings of anxiety or disgust when confronted by certain stories or individuals.\n\nDisgust is a powerful negative emotion linked to very quick responding, and could create a need to turn away from something immediately. Feelings of anxiety may be linked to images of political figures , for instance.\n\nI have just finished writing a book exploring climate anxiety . For some, this can be a debilitating form of anxiety, and it is growing globally especially among young people . It can be overwhelming, affecting study, work and sleep .\n\nThe recent image of Trump yelling that \"we're going to drill, baby, drill\" has been implanted in the minds of many who suffer from climate anxiety , possibly intensifying their distress.\n\nFor many Democrats, the aftermath of Trump's victory was emotionally devastating. On October 24 2024 (two weeks before the election), an open letter was published in the New York Times signed by 233 mental health professionals with the following warning: \"We have an ethical duty to warn the public that Donald Trump is an existential threat to democracy. His symptoms of severe, untreatable personality disorder - malignant narcissism - makes him deceitful, destructive, deluded and dangerous. He is grossly unfit for leadership.\"\n\nFor Democrats in particular, Trump may display many negative features including his lack of remorse or self-awareness , his break from traditional political norms and use of populist, nationalist rhetoric , or his rejection of civil discourse in favour of divisive and inflammatory language .\n\nSo Trump's victory seemed, to many Democrats, to signal the triumph of ignorance, bigotry and authoritarianism. An emotional response from them was always likely, and chimes with this avoiding of news.\n\nCognitive dissonance theory suggests that when individuals are confronted with information (in this case from Trump) that contradicts their deeply held beliefs but they still sit and listen dutifully, this can create considerable psychological discomfort .\n\nTo reduce this discomfort , people often engage in behaviour that avoids or minimises this conflict. But they can't change their political views, and they can't change Trump or his policies (he has got an incredibly powerful mandate), so that leaves few other options. Or perhaps just one: avoiding the relentless media cycle of Trump's tweets, policies, pronouncements, presidential pardons, and executive orders .\n\nBy switching off, Democrats - and even some Republicans - can temporarily ease the cognitive dissonance they feel, and this may allow some emotional relief.\n\nMoreover, this avoidance might help protect them against the further erosion of their political and social identity. They might feel that if they continue to consume news that reaffirms Trump's power, or as if they are accepting their defeat and their misreading of the American public and, by extension, the legitimacy of his presidency.\n\nBut where will that disengagement take them? And how easy will it be for them to overcome their visceral response to reengage, to reassert themselves and fight back? It's always more difficult when thoughts and emotion are so tightly intertwined like this.\n\nBut for US Democrats, engagement based on accurate information is critical for the ongoing democratic process, regardless of how painful this might feel right now.\n\nGeoff Beattie , Professor of Psychology, Edge Hill University\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Picture taken April 20, 2022.\n\nA group of House Democrats is demanding that the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform conduct a public hearing on the Trump administration and the so-called Department of Government Efficiency's plans for the U.S. Postal Service, in light of recent reporting that U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy says he signed an agreement with DOGE to assist the nation's mail service \"in identifying and achieving further efficiencies.\"\n\nThe news follows Washington Post coverage from February, when the outlet reported that U.S. President Donald Trump is considering putting the Postal Service under the control of the Commerce Department. In December, the Post also reported that Trump was eyeing privatizing the Postal Service. Elon Musk , a GOP megadonor who is playing a core role in Trump's efforts to slash federal spending and personnel, has also said the Postal Service should be privatized .\n\nPostal workers unions are fiercely opposed to any effort to privatize the Postal Service.\n\n\"The Trump administration... is now subjecting the USPS, America's most trusted federal institution, to the chainsaw approach of Elon Musk and DOGE. This broad assault on the independence of the USPS demands congressional oversight, especially from the committee with jurisdiction over the USPS,\" according to the letter, which was signed by 20 House Democrats.\n\nIn a March 13 letter to congressional leaders, U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy told Congress he signed an agreement with representatives from Elon Musk's DOGE and the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) so that DOGE could help the U.S. Postal Service, which has experienced billions in financial losses in recent years, work to address \"big problems.\"\n\nThe Postal Service plans to cut 10,000 employees in the next 30 days through a voluntary early retirement program, according to DeJoy's letter.\n\nDeJoy cited challenges facing the Postal Service, such as \"mismanagement of our self-funded retirement assets,\" \"burdensome regulatory requirements restricting normal business practice,\" and \"unfunded mandates imposed on us by legislation.\"\n\nThe letter demanding a public hearing, which was addressed to House Oversight Committee Chair Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.), was spearheaded by Oversight Committee Ranking Member Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.), and Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D-Md.)\n\n\"This backroom agreement between the billionaire-led DOGE and Postmaster DeJoy sets off alarm bells about this administration's plans for the Postal Service's role as a cornerstone public institution,\" according to the letter. \"The Postal Service facilitates the delivery of more than 115 billion pieces of mail each year, a significant portion of which is delivered to rural, low-income, and hard-to-reach areas that would not otherwise receive service if not for the universal service obligation, which has received bipartisan support in Congress and is integral to the mission of Postal Service.\"\n\n\"We agree that there are steps Congress could take to strengthen the financial sustainability of the Postal Service, but any potential deal that would give Elon Musk and his DOGE associates unilateral authority to manipulate the most critical, expansive national mail network on the planet is deeply troubling,\" they continued.\n\nThe group is urging that the committee hold a hearing and wrote that they have prepared a letter to send to DeJoy asking that he furnish any signed agreements he made with the GSA and DOGE. The group is urging that Comer also sign on to that letter."

Veteran Democratic strategist James Carville is arguing that Trump's policies are so terrible that Democrats need to sit back and watch him self-destruct.\n\nAccording to Politico's Rachel Bade , House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-New York) is gearing up to aggressively battle Republicans over a spending bill and the mass layoffs of federal workers being carried out by the Trump Administration with the help of the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\n\"This time,\" Bade reports in an article published on March 4 , \"it's Democrats who are itching for a fight - over the Department of Government Efficiency cuts that Trump has blessed and deputized mogul Elon Musk has gleefully carried out. Senior House Democrats have spent recent days privately surveying their members about whether they'd be willing to shut the government down over DOGE cuts, according to multiple well-placed Democratic sources I spoke to over the weekend. So far, they're encountering little resistance.\"\n\nDemocratic lawmakers, according to Bade , \"have been emboldened by recent polling showing that the public has started to shift against DOGE, as Americans hear more about potentially losing benefits and veterans getting kicked out of jobs.\"\n\n\"That's to say nothing of the recent town-hall protests, where Republican lawmakers took an earful from constituents raging against DOGE,\" Bade explains . \"Perhaps most importantly, Democrats up and down the leadership chain are hearing not only from the liberal base, but people they consider more mainstream - donors, strategists and constituents who believe they need to show some fight, and fast.\"\n\nBade notes that \"a Democrat-induced shutdown\" of the United States' federal government could \"backfire on their party politically and only empower Musk even more to slash and burn his way through federal agencies.\"\n\nHowever, a senior Democratic House aide, interviewed on condition of anonymity, told Politico , \"Nobody wants a shutdown, but they don't feel like aiding and abetting what's happening, with Musk and Trump taking a wrecking ball to health care in particular.

Others accused Bennet of \"killing the planet\" and taking money from oil and gas, which Bennet denied.\n\nSince Trump took office in January, he has fired thousands of federal employees , frozen federal funding approved by Congress and resisted court orders , among dozens of other extreme executive actions.\n\nThe auditorium erupted between people shouting at Bennet and people rebutting in defense of Bennet.\n\n\"You can't compromise with fascists,\" one person yelled.\n\n\"You're attacking the wrong man,\" a woman shouted back.\n\n\"We're not going to do it this way,\" Bennet said. He told one person, \"What you're saying is totally false. It's not true.\"\n\nLater in the night, other attendees who were also removed from the venue called out to criticize continued U.S. support for Israel despite the thousands of civilian deaths in Gaza. \"Stop spending more on bombs than you do on schools,\" one attendee said.\n\nPolice escorted out just under 10 people throughout the night after Bennet's staff attempted to talk them down.\n\n\"I know that these are intense times and that we can have disagreements, but I don't think that engaging in that way is helpful,\" Pettersen said.\n\nDespite the interruptions, Bennet said he would still encourage his Republican colleagues to hold town halls and hear directly from constituents.\n\n\"This is a free country. People have the right to express themselves,\" he said to reporters after the town hall. \"There are always going to be instances like that, but we also were able to have the conversation that we needed to have tonight.\"\n\nBennet also hosted a town hall in Greeley Tuesday night and will host one more in Colorado Springs on Thursday. Progressive groups are holding \"people's town halls\" in Republican congressional districts around the country where Republicans are declining to engage directly with constituents.\n\nThe first constituent to ask a question Wednesday said \"words are great\" but that he wasn't seeing any action, and attendees asking for more substantial answers and actions to oppose Trump policies continued throughout the night.\n\nAmanda Arlington, a Parker resident who worked at Denver Public Schools when Bennet was the district's superintendent, said she saw him show up for kids in classrooms at the schools regularly, but she hasn't seen that translate to similar action during his time in the Senate, she said. Arlington said she hasn't heard a plan for how Democrats are actually working against Trump, and she asked Bennet and Pettersen to share one.\n\n\"I feel like you're talking pretty,\" Arlington told Bennet while asking a question during the town hall. \"I want to see obstruction.\"\n\nBennet said that with Trump in the White House and majorities in both chambers of Congress, Democrats have to find other methods of pushing back.\n\n\"It doesn't do anybody any good for us to pretend that that's not real,\" Bennet said of Republican control in Washington. \"But it's not an excuse for not continuing to push. It's not an excuse to not continue to lift our voices.\"\n\nDemocrats need to \"obstruct everything,\" Arlington told Newsline after the town hall, because Republican plans at the federal level \"are terrifying.\"\n\n\"We need leadership to say no, because we're not in Washington,\" she said. \"I mean Republicans have been doing that for years. They have a lot of power and they stopped a lot of (President Barack) Obama's agenda ... I want to see that from the Democrats, and I'm not seeing it.\"\n\nShe added that Republicans are \"going to devastate the economy. They're going to devastate kids. They're going to devastate health care, and devastate rural America.\"\n\nJake Kotula from Denver said Republican actions are \"a huge departure from the norm,\" and he hasn't seen any different behavior from Democrats to react to the new political landscape.\n\n\"The question I was going to ask them was, 'What distinctly are you going to do differently now that the rules of engagement are different?'\" Kotula said in an interview with Newsline after the town hall. \"Give us actionable steps about how you are bucking the norm the way that the Republicans are bucking the norm, the way they are eroding democracy.\"\n\nBoth Colorado Democrats at the town hall should \"weaponize the bureaucratic foundations of legislative proceedings\" like the Senate filibuster and encourage others in their chambers to do the same to support the judiciary, Kotula said. He got to tell Pettersen his thoughts after the town hall concluded. Both elected officials talked to people in the audience.\n\nRon Meehan from Lakewood said many people have \"deeply rooted and valid concerns\" about protecting federal assistance programs, democracy and the climate, and residents want to know what Democrats are doing to respond to those concerns, and how they can get involved.\n\n\"I am hopeful that they will have a more unified front, and they will be able to pull the public more in, because we know that the public right now is engaged,\" Meehan said in an interview with Newsline after the town hall. \"They are furious about the real impacts that these (decisions) are having on people's lives and their ability to get by, and we have to have really meaningful action on that.\"\n\nYOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.\n\nColorado Newsline is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

      "text": "'Never seen people so mad': Democrats call for Schumer to resign\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) listens as U.S. President Donald Trump addresses a joint session of Congress at the U.S. Capitol on March 04, 2025 in Washington, DC. Win McNamee/Pool via REUTERS\n\nDemocrats across the political spectrum-liberal, moderate, and progressive-appear united in their outrage over Senate Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's decision to back the Republican-led bill to fund the government and prevent a shutdown. They argue that the legislation enables President Donald Trump and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to continue dismantling the federal government while jeopardizing health care and veterans' benefits. Without a signed bill, the federal government will shut down at 12:01 AM on Saturday.\n\nCalls are mounting for Leader Schumer to resign. There appears to be a movement on social media demanding his resignation, across platforms including X , Bluesky , and TikTok .\n\nProtestors in New York City are chanting, \"Vote no, it's time to go,\" while some hold up signs that read, \"Schumer - Be a fighter not a collaborator,\" and, \"Don't be a Schumer chicken s-.\"\n\nSENATOR AOC?\n\nSome are calling for U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the popular progressive Democrat from New York, to primary the 74-year old Schumer, who was first elected to Congress in 1981.\n\n\"I think there is a deep sense of outrage and betrayal,\" Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez told reporters on Thursday. \"And this is not just about progressive Democrats. This is across the board. The entire party. There are members of Congress who have won Trump-held districts in some of the most difficult territory in the United States, who walked the plank and took innumerable risks in order to defend the American people, in order to defend Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare. Just to see some Senate Democrats even consider acquiescing to Elon Musk, I think it is a huge slap in the face, and I think that there is a wide sense of betrayal if things proceed as as currently planned.\"\n\nSome House Democrats \"are so infuriated with Schumer's decision\" that they have begun encouraging Ocasio-Cortez \"to run against Schumer in a primary,\" CNN reported Thursday night. \"Multiple Democrats in the Congressional Progressive Caucus and others directly encouraged Ocasio-Cortez to run on Thursday night after Schumer's announcement.\"\n\nOne member said that Democrats were \"so mad,\" CNN added, \"that even centrist Democrats were 'ready to write checks for AOC for Senate,' adding that they have 'never seen people so mad.'\"\n\nSCHUMER'S 'STRATEGY'\n\nWhen in the minority, Democrats for years have handed Republicans enough votes to help pass numerous \"continuing resolutions,\" bills that keep the federal government's lights on, but this time it's different. Right now, Democrats are aching for a leader who will fight the Trump/Musk/MAGA machine.\n\nTheir anger erupted Thursday night.\n\nLeader Schumer on Wednesday had announced that it did not appear there would be enough Democratic votes to help Senate Republicans pass the House bill, and instead that they would filibuster it. But on Thursday afternoon he declared he would support the legislation, suggesting there would be enough votes to pass it.\n\nSchumer's reasoning is not wrong, many are willing to admit. Elon Musk reportedly wants the shutdown because if the government stays closed for 30 days, he can then mass fire even more government employees.\n\nBut Democrats are saying Schumer's rationale does not meet the moment. They want someone to fight, not cave.\n\nAdam Jentleson is a writer, political commentator, and the former deputy chief of staff to the late U.S. Senator Harry Reid. Reid, a Democrat from Nevada, was an extraordinarily successful Senate Majority Leader from 2007 to 2015.\n\n\"There is a lot of 'what would Harry Reid have done?' and sadly we will never know,\" Jentleson wrote late Friday morning. \"But I can say that we won the 2013 shutdown because we spent months laying track on a clear message about health care. The terms of the shutdown were well-defined before it happened.\"\n\nCritics say that's what's missing - that Leader Schumer hasn't bothered to do that.\n\nPointing to a late Friday morning report indicating that Senate Republican Majority Leader John Thune said that he and Leader Schumer have not even spoken, Democratic strategist Matt McDermott writes , \"The problem here is that all evidence suggests @SenSchumer has no strategy whatsoever. Absolutely stunning that he hasn't talked to the Senate Majority leader, even to attempt to negotiate concessions.\"\n\nMcDermott also offered this insight:\n\nMSNBC's Chris Hayes on Thursday night sat down with Schumer, and summed up the situation for him .\n\n\"I've seen a lot of House members, and across an ideological range, interestingly enough, urging the Senate to filibuster this, saying, look, this is existential about whether we control the power of the purse or not. We cannot essentially sign off on this DOGE unilateral arrogation of this power,\" Hayes explained.\n\nThe Democratic Leader's response was that \"it's different in the Senate,\" because voting against the bill in the House would not have led to a shutdown. But that's incorrect. If the House bill failed, and no other passed, that would have absolutely led to a shutdown.\n\n\"I felt so strongly that the shutdown would be the greatest disaster we face with these arrogant, arrogant autocrats that we had to avoid the shutdown and fight and many of the other things, every other issue that we have,\" Schumer added.\n\n'TEAM FIGHT' - 'MISREAD THIS AT YOUR OWN PERIL'\n\nIllinois Democratic Governor JB Pritzker issued a statement explaining his opposition to passing the continuing resolution, but his chief of staff late Thursday night served up an analysis of what Democrats are feeling.\n\n\"The fight going on in the Democratic Party right now is not between hard left, left and moderate,\" explained Anne Caprara. \"It's between those who want to fight and those who want to cave. And Team Fight stretches across all ideological aspects of the Party. Misread this at your own peril.\"\n\nRight now, it appears there might be enough Senate Democrats willing to vote in favor of the continuing resolution, or at least, vote for \"cloture,\" meaning to allow debate on the bill.\n\nOne who is not voting yes is U.S. Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA), largely considered a moderate Democrat.\n\n\"When I saw the House bill on Sunday, I said, 'Hell no,' because I just was not interested in voting for something that was going to enable these guys to fire more veterans and cut education and health programs, screw up air safety, tank the economy,\" Senator Kaine said Thursday morning on MSNBC. \"Why would I do it?\"\n\nKaine noted that during an Armed Services Committee,\"the Pentagon looked us in the face and said, this House CR will hurt national security, will weaken our ability to maintain ships and subs. It's going to do damage to us. And then my Republican colleagues on the committee said, we agree with you, this is going to hurt national security, but it's better than a shutdown.\"\n\nHe criticized Speaker Johnson f0r sending House members home after passing the continuing resolution this week, because there's now little means to alter the bill.\n\n\"And I decided then, when the Republicans are trashing this, but acting like they have to go along, I'm not going along.\"\n\n\"I went back to my days in living in Honduras,\" Kaine shared, \"when it was a military dictatorship, and I learned something very important. That a bully can take something from you but you shouldn't hand it over to him, so I'm voting no.\"\n\nKaine also said, \"we're winning cases in court right now against things that Trump is doing. But if we vote for this bill and sort of say, 'Okay, we're going to put our imprimatur on some of this,' I even worry it might make it harder for us to prevail in court on some of these battles.\"\n\nPRAISE FROM TRUMP\n\nCritics from across the Democratic spectrum continue to blast Senator Schumer.\n\n\"Schumer's decision is an unconscionable surrender that shows he does not have what it takes to meet this moment,\" explained MeidasTouch co-founder Brett Meiselas on Thursday night. \"Time for new leadership in the Democratic Party.\"\n\n\"It is clear that some of us understand the present danger & some don't! I stand by the NO vote on the blank check for Trump & Elon,\" wrote U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX). \"I've got no explanation nor agreement with Senate Dems being complicit in Trump's Tyranny.\"\n\nSiriusXM host Qasim Rashid, Esq. wrote : \"Schumer thinks he's smart to vote with GOP now because 'in 6 months Trump will be unpopular.'\"\n\n\"What's Schumer smoking to think THIS time is different? Schumer-resign & retire.\"\n\n\"How badly do you have to f- up being the Democratic leader that Trump is praising and congratulating you????\" an astonished Elie Mystal, the justice correspondent for The Nation, asked on Friday.\n\nIndeed, President Trump is praising Leader Schumer.\n\n\"Congratulations to Chuck Schumer for doing the right thing - Took 'guts' and courage!\" Trump wrote on Friday morning. \"The big Tax Cuts, L.A. fire fix, Debt Ceiling Bill, and so much more, is coming. We should all work together on that very dangerous situation. A non pass would be a Country destroyer, approval will lead us to new heights. Again, really good and smart move by Senator Schumer. This could lead to something big for the USA, a whole new direction and beginning! DJT.\"\n\nWatch the video above or at this link ."

      "text": "Even amid Trump administration dysfunction, Democrats are noticeably flailing\n\nU.S. Rep. Al Green, a Texas Democrat, did his best to make \"good trouble\" during President Donald Trump's first address to Congress since taking office in January.\n\nBrandishing his cane, the Lone Star septuagenarian rose from his seat in the U.S. House chamber and challenged Trump's claim that he has a sweeping mandate to enact the tidal wave of changes his Republican administration has unleashed within the federal government.\n\nGreen stood alone, with his Democratic colleagues content to sit silent and hold quaint church fan signs with words that called the president a liar and criticized billionaire bureaucrat Elon Musk.\n\n\"If [Democrats] are going to use a 77-year-old heckling congressman as the face of their resistance, then bring it on,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, told Fox News after Trump's speech. \"But we're not going to tolerate that on the House floor, and I don't think the American people are going to tolerate that either.\"\n\nFor the time being, let's set aside Johnson's apparent amnesia when it comes to far more outlandish outbursts from Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert and other GOP lawmakers during former President Joe Biden's speeches to Congress. Their antics occurred despite pleas from Johnson for decorum.\n\nOtherwise, the speaker's assessment of Democrats is spot on. Before, during and since Trump's address, they have been hard pressed to present a united front or take advantage of the mayhem that has ensued since Trump , Musk & Associates set upon their mass purging of government jobs, on-again/off-again tariffs and a 180-degree turn on U.S. global diplomacy.\n\nThe chaos has even led some diehard Republicans to question the administration's direction, notably U.S. Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana. Otherwise a Trump dieheard, he's consistently issued warnings against any alliance with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who the senator has called \"a gangster\" and \"an evil man\" who \"makes Jeffrey Dahmer look like Mother Theresa.\"\n\nYet even with the current situation begging for a voice of reason, Democrats have fumbled to present a coherent message. And for a party that's desperately trying to make headway after losing last year's presidential election and its slim U.S. Senate majority, that's not a recipe for success.\n\nRachel Janfaza has paid attention to the Democrats' decline for a while now. She's a journalist who follows Gen Z political trends and young voters (I recommend her Substack ), a group that will be critical in next year's midterms and the 2028 presidential election when Trump (presumably) won't seek another term.\n\nBefore Trump's speech to Congress, Janfaza took note of Democrats' cringeworthy use of social media. First, nearly two dozen Senate Democrats posted almost identical Instagram reels with the caption \"Sh-t That Ain't True\" ahead of Trump's address. Next, they latched on to a months-old \" Choose Your Fighter \" Tik Tok trend.\n\nWatch those links, especially if you're part of Gen X, a boomer or even a millennial. Tell me they don't give you that same feeling I get when my teen daughter says: \"Dad, stop dancing!\"\n\nThe awkwardness - and lack of impact - certainly made an impression with Janfaza in the most recent of her newsletter, The Up and Up .\n\n\"The futile social media plays come as every hour, if not minute, young Americans are getting real-time alerts about how Trump (and yes, Musk) are dismantling core government systems - rolling back federal employment protections, gutting funding, and targeting programs that could directly impact their futures (including internship and educational programs),\" she wrote.\n\nDemocrats are also failing to fill the void here in Louisiana, where Republican state leaders and lawmakers have adroitly held the spotlight on matters such as criminal justice and reproductive health. Progressives can't gather enough support to steer the party where they think it needs to head, and moderates desperately long to regain the middle ground they lost long ago to the GOP.\n\nThere's one lesson for Democrats to learn from Rep. Al Green's quixotic moment on the House floor, and it comes straight from the soul music mainstay with whom the congressman shares a name: \"Let's Stay Together.\"\n\nIf they can't at least do that, they should get used to another greatest hit from Green: \"Tired of Being Alone.\"\n\nLouisiana Illuminator is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

      "text": "Democrats Have a Man Problem\n\nThe quest to win back the men lost to MAGA opens a rift over class and gender that party leaders are struggling to close.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nC hances are low that Joe Rogan will save your soul-or your party. Since Donald Trump's election victory, countless Democrats have lamented their party's losses among men, and young men, in particular. One refrain has been a yearning for a \"Rogan of the left\" who might woo back all the dudes who have migrated to MAGA. If the wishfulness is misplaced, the underlying problem is real: Trump carried men by roughly 12 points in November, including 57 percent of men under 30 .\n\nI recently spoke with Democrats across different levels of leadership to see how they were trying to address this electorally lethal gender gap. Two theories for how to win back men, I found, are bubbling up. One is to improve the party's cultural appeal to men, embracing rather than scolding masculinity. The other is to focus on more traditional messaging about the economy, on the assumption that if Democrats build an agenda for blue-collar America, the guys will follow.\n\nThese approaches are not necessarily in conflict, but they each present a challenge for the modern Democratic Party. And as pundits and consultants peddle their rival solutions, they highlight another risk: Even if Democrats can settle on a message, will voters believe they really mean it?\n\nJonathan Chait: Democrats show why they lost\n\nR epresentative Jake Auchincloss of Massachusetts is one of many Democrats who believe that the party has to make a serious, sustained outreach effort to connect with men. What Democrats should not say or do seems more obvious than what they should proactively offer. \"No one wants to hear men talk about masculinity,\" Auchincloss, a former Marine, told me. \"We're not going to orient society's decision making to the cognitive worldview of a 16-year-old male.\"\n\nEven as he disavowed the idea that solving the guy problem should involve some promotion of testosterone-laced pandering, Auchincloss suggested that the party ought to find its way to a more positive, inspirational message. \"We need to embrace a culture of heroism, not a culture of victimhood. Young men need models for their ambition,\" he said.\n\nSenator Chris Murphy of Connecticut also notes liberal squeamishness about masculine themes; he says the party is losing male voters in part because even talking about the need to improve the lives of men could run afoul of what he calls the \"word police\" on the left. Murphy told me, \"There's a worry that when you start talking about gender differences and masculinity, that you're going to very quickly get in trouble.\" The Democratic Party, he thinks, has not been purposeful enough in opening up a conversation with men in general and young men specifically. \"There is a reluctance inside the progressive movement to squarely acknowledge gender differences, and that has really put us on the back foot.\"\n\nFor Murphy, the right message might come from an earlier era-a notion that could seem antithetical to the very idea of progressivism. \"We cannot and shouldn't abandon some of the traditional ways that men find value and meaning: in providing protection, in taking high levels of risk, in taking pride in physical work,\" he told me. \"There's a lot of worry that all of those traditional male characteristics are somehow illegitimate.\"\n\nSo far, the GOP seems to be doing a far more effective job of engaging male voters in ways that reflect the reality of today's popular culture. Trump has embraced UFC's Dana White, and has made grand entrances at MMA fights. (Years before he ran for president, Trump would appear at pro-wrestling events, and he is a member of the WWE hall of fame.) \"We have to go where people are consuming culture and sports and entertainment,\" Auchincloss told me, \"and talk about issues of the day in a way that is coded for political orientation but that is more broadly accessible and interesting.\"\n\nLast fall, now-Senator Ruben Gallego of Arizona tried this Go where the men are concept. \"We should do anything to reach out to voters,\" he told me. \"And that means men.\" Gallego argues that Democrats have been too hesitant to directly address men's everyday reality, and that this is a grave mistake. \"Black, Latino, and white men are not doing well in this country. They're not obtaining college degrees,\" Gallego said. \"If we were to look at the numbers and just take out the gender, we would say, Wow, that group of Americans needs some attention . But all of a sudden, if you add the little m next to that, it's somehow something that we shouldn't be worried about-and I reject that.\"\n\nGallego's Senate-campaign stops included boxing gyms, soccer watch parties, and Mexican rodeos. Trump won the state at the presidential level by more than five percentage points, but Gallego defeated his Republican challenger, Kari Lake, in the Senate battle with a 2.4 percent margin. \"I think the voters, the male voters, understood that I understood them and what they were going through,\" he said.\n\nThe conundrum for Democrats that Murphy identifies is that they are ill-equipped to compete with Republicans for a jacked-up version of manhood because doing so would cut against the interests and rights of a crucial bloc of their coalition: women. \"Now the right is offering a really irresponsible antidote, which is to just roll all the progress back and return to an era in which men were dominant politically and economically,\" Murphy said. But as cartoonish as MAGA hypermasculinity is, it sends out a signal that \"matters to a lot of men-that only the right really cares about the way in which they're feeling pretty shitty.\"\n\nNo one I spoke with suggested that the Democratic Party would (or should) ever abandon its positions on women's rights. \"I don't think you have to move away from anything to be inclusive of other things,\" Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina told me. One possible Democratic plan, so far as I could discern it, was to keep expanding the parameters of acceptable discourse and opinions, rather than box themselves in. Clyburn said he was surprised to see so many young men break for Trump in November. He believes that his party has gotten itself into a quagmire. \"We've set ourselves up for this messaging war that we're losing,\" Clyburn told me. \"In the last election,\" he said, \"sound bites that developed around gender inequity caused serious problems. And they're still causing problems.\"\n\nRead: Democrats are losing the culture wars\n\nO r maybe sound bites are not the problem.\n\nLast fall, the Democratic strategist James Carville was \"certain\" that Kamala Harris would defeat Donald Trump. If Carville had adhered to his own maxim- It's the economy, stupid -he might have seen Trump's victory coming. One lesson of 2024, some of the elected officials I spoke with said, was that Democratic power brokers were woefully oblivious of the economic struggles of working-class Americans. They also suggested that the project of winning back the working class and the project of winning back men were one and the same.\n\nVoters, the admittedly simple theory goes, will support the candidate and party that they believe will improve their daily lives. The MAGA movement has done a keen job of tapping into the discontent and resentment that many men feel over declining job prospects. Democrats need to compete by offering a material path out of despair.\n\n\"The young men that I'm talking to are not in love with politics, period ,\" Senator Raphael Warnock of Georgia told me. \"They want their lives to work. And it's important that people feel you walking with them and hearing them.\" Warnock was adamant that, contrary to certain media narratives, Trump did not triumph in a landslide victory. \"He won by the margin of people's disengagement, because they feel the ways in which the democracy is becoming increasingly undemocratic,\" he said. \"And my job is not for them to hear my voice; it is to give the people their voice.\"\n\nThe crucial way to reengage disaffected men, multiple Democrats told me, is to champion an economy that \"works like Legos, not Monopoly,\" as Auchincloss put it. \"An economy where we are building more technical vocational high schools, and we are celebrating the craftsmanship of the trades so that young men have a sense of autonomy and being a provider.\" Murphy said that his party should aim to build the sort of middle-class prosperity that enables one breadwinner to support a family of four, allowing one parent to choose to be a homemaker.\n\nBut if Democrats believe that Lego economic policies could be popular, they also know that many voters associate the party with government handouts and top-down programs, which, on the whole, are not very popular. This is something the MAGA movement has figured out, painting all Democrats as out-of-touch, coastal elites.\n\nFor Representative Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington State, the party's primary political problem is undoubtedly class-which is not something that a change of messaging from \"the consultant-industrial complex\" can fix, she told me. Rather, authenticity is the only way to make true connections. Voters don't want to be humored, she believes; they want to be heard. \"People who are trying to signal some kind of an alignment with the working class are just undermining themselves,\" she said. \"The donor class needs to pay more attention to how rooted a candidate is in their community, and less about whether or not a candidate ticks every ideological or policy box.\"\n\nShe stressed the importance of people knowing that their representatives \"are actually living in the same reality\" as they are-and that a white-collar professional is not always the best fit. She believes that people want to see themselves in their representatives. \"There are so many nonpolitical ways to communicate your values that haven't been respected or exercised,\" she told me. Gluesenkamp Perez has gained a national profile for the way she aims to speak for the sort of blue-collar America that many Democrats realize they've become disconnected from. She and her husband own an auto repair shop in the Pacific Northwest, and she won reelection in a Republican district that's supported Trump in the past three elections. \"Being able to make a clutch last for 500,000 miles-that's really cool to a lot of people,\" she told me.\n\n\"I think about all the ways that I've seen this sort of unconscious disrespect for people in the trades,\" she said. \"I'll hear people say, 'Well, you know, my dad was just a janitor, and I'm the first person in my family to go to college,' and I'm like, What does that sound like to everyone in the room who didn't go to college? That you think you're better than them.\"\n\nWhat became clear from my conversations was that Democrats want to get back to eye level with their potential voters, particularly men. But, as Clyburn and others acknowledged, the party's progressive social agenda can be an obstacle to its moderate wing. At her town halls, Gluesenkamp Perez told me, she has found her constituents especially fired up over the rules about trans women in sports-an issue that Trump has inflamed.\n\n\"What I saw was that those people were mostly people that had been driving their girls to sports practice for 12 years, and their kids' best shot at going to college was a scholarship,\" she told me. \"This was an argument about resource access, not about morality.\" Gluesenkamp Perez has sometimes crossed over to side with the GOP, but she recently voted against Republican-sponsored legislation to keep transgender women and girls out of school sports.\n\nShe also told me that having a real values discussion is impossible until voters feel respected, and that a candidate is listening to them. A genuine curiosity about the lives of the people who send you to Congress is not a mere nicety but an essential quality for Democrats who seem remote to the people they represent. \"A lot of my colleagues just go out there and try to explain stuff to people all the time,\" Gluesenkamp Perez said. \"A lot of us don't really have confidence that the spreadsheets they're pointing to are the full picture.\"\n\nJust being real could help Democrats appeal to voters of all stripes, but they have to hope that it will resonate with disaffected men-particularly young men-who may have turned toward Trump. Democrats may not have to bend their values completely out of shape to suit the political environment, but they can't afford to write anyone off."

If the president's speech was poor or faltering, the opposition can only pile on for a few minutes.\n\nSo pity Senator Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, who got handed the task of a response to Donald Trump's two-hour carnival of lies and stunts. Slotkin gave a good, normal speech in which she laid out some of her party's issues with Trump on the economy and national security.\n\nIt was so normal, in fact, that it was exactly the wrong speech to give.\n\nBut first, it's important to note that it was a good speech. Slotkin wisely decided to forgo any stagey settings, appearing in front of neatly placed flags instead of in her office or a kitchen. She gave a shout-out to her home state while managing to avoid folksy familiarity or posturing. She also stayed away from wonkery, speaking in the kind of clear language people use in daily conversation. (Okay, there was some thudding language about investment and \"jobs of the future,\" but these are minor speechwriting offenses.)\n\nRead: The Trump backers who have buyer's remorse\n\nAnd to her credit, Slotkin reminded people that Elon Musk is an unaccountable über-bureaucrat leading a \"gang of 20-year-olds\" who are rummaging through the personal data of millions of Americans. As a senator from a state bordering Canada, she asked if Americans are comfortable kicking our sister nation in the teeth.\n\nSo what's not to like? Slotkin-like so many in her party lately-failed to convey any sense of real urgency or alarm. Her speech could have been given in Trump's first term, perhaps in 2017 or 2018, but we are no longer in that moment. The president's address was so extreme, so full of bizarre claims and ideas , exaggerations and distortions and lies, that it should have called his fitness to serve into question. He preened about a Cabinet that includes some of the strangest, and least qualified , members in American history. Although his speech went exceptionally long, he said almost nothing of substance, and the few plans he put forward were mostly applause bait for his Republican sycophants in the room and his base at home.\n\nIt's easy for me to sit in my living room in Rhode Island and suggest what others should say. But in her response, Slotkin failed to capture the hallucinatory nature of our national politics. As a former Republican, I nodded when Slotkin said that Ronald Reagan would be rolling in his grave at what Slotkin called the \"spectacle\" of last week's Oval Office attack on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. But is that really the message of a fighting opposition? Is it an effective rallying cry either to older voters or to a new generation to say, in effect, that Reagan-even now a polarizing figure-would have hated Trump? (Of course he would have.) Isn't the threat facing America far greater than that?\n\nRead: Lawful, but enormously destructive\n\nSlotkin's best moment was when she pleaded with people to do more than be mere observers of politics, and said that doomscrolling on phones isn't the same thing as genuine political engagement. And she issued her own Reaganesque call to remember that America is not just \"a patch of land between two oceans,\" that America is great because of its ideals. But her admonition to her fellow citizens not to fool themselves about the fragility of democracy, while admirable, was strangely detached from a specific attack on the source of that menace.\n\nDid Americans vote for Kash Patel to lead the FBI, or Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to run the Department of Health and Human Services, or Pete Hegseth to be secretary of defense? Trump took time to recognize and praise all three of those men in his speech. So why not ask that question-directly and without needless throat-clearing about the importance and necessity of change?\n\nSlotkin's response reflected the fractured approach of the Democrats to Trump in general. Some of them refused to attend tonight's address, some of them held up little Ping-Pong paddles with messages on them (a silly idea that looked even worse in its execution), and others meandered out. One, Representative Al Green of Texas, got himself thrown out within the first minutes, a stunt that merely gave Speaker Mike Johnson a chance to look strong and decisive, if only for a moment.\n\nI'm not a fan of performative protest, and initially I thought the Democrats who chose to attend the address made the right call. But when Trump referred to Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts as \"Pocahontas,\" they could have left en bloc , declaring once they were outside that they would take no part in any further demeaning of the House chamber-or, for that matter, of American democracy. Instead, they sat there and took it, their opposition to Trump a kind of hodgepodge of rage, bemusement, boredom, and irritation.\n\nSlotkin's address suffered from the same half-heartedness that has seized the Democrats since last November. Her response, and the behavior of the Democrats in general, showed that they still fear being a full-throated opposition party, because they believe that they will alienate voters who will somehow be offended at them for taking a stand against Trump's schemes.\n\nSlotkin is a centrist-as she noted, she won in areas that also voted for Trump-and her victory in Michigan proved that centrism can be a powerful anchor against extremists. But centrism is not the same as meekness. America does not need a \"resistance,\" or stale slogans, or people putting those slogans on little paddles. It needs an opposition party that boldly defends the nation's virtues, the rule of law, and the rights of its people."

      "text": "The Conversation Democrats Need to Have\n\nThe party should stop talking to itself and start hearing what voters have to say.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nIn the weeks since the election, I've been thinking about the woman who told me she'd heard that Kamala Harris \"let in all the illegals who killed all those cops.\"\n\nI met her when a few of us from Pod Save America were knocking doors in Las Vegas the Sunday before the election. She was listed in the voter file as a 72-year-old registered Democrat who hadn't voted yet, so we rang the doorbell and were greeted by a small Asian woman and a very large dog. Her broken English wasn't easy to understand, and the barking didn't help, but her concern about the cop-killing immigrants was clear.\n\nWe skipped the fact-check and assured the woman that Vice President Harris promised to crack down on illegal immigration and close the border if it got out of control. She seemed mildly encouraged, but not sold. We told her that Harris also wanted to make prescriptions cheaper for her and cut her taxes. Then she pointed to a photo of the vice president on the campaign literature we were holding: \"Is that her?\" We nodded. The woman gave us a thumbs-up and a promise that she'd vote for Harris.\n\nThis wasn't the type of exchange we'd expected, but only because the outcome was successful. Most interactions with voters aren't as satisfying as you hope, and some are just bizarre. When I was conducting focus groups for a podcast I host called The Wilderness , a Latino voter in Vegas told me that his two favorite political leaders were Governor Ron DeSantis and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, because they were both \"outsiders\" who were willing to \"take on the establishment.\" An older Milwaukee voter said that he had voted for Barack Obama and then Donald Trump because \"they both felt like change.\" A young Black man in Atlanta said that because of crime and inflation, he regretted his vote for Joe Biden, and that \"at least Trump is an honest liar.\"\n\nRogé Karma: Why the Democrats got the politics of immigration so wrong for so long\n\nThe show would sometimes get harsh reviews from Democrats, whose reactions to these focus groups I'd charitably describe as frustrated disbelief: \"Infuriating.\" \"Depressing.\" \"Couldn't listen.\" \"Why didn't you correct them?\" \"How did you not just walk out?\"\n\nI understand why people would feel this way. Well, I understand why people like us would feel this way. If you care enough about politics to read The Atlantic or listen to Pod Save America or scroll through an infinite feed of strangers' opinions, you mostly encounter broadly cohesive political identities. Even if we don't agree with the views of leftists or liberals or Never Trumpers or MAGA Republicans, we understand them (or at least we think we do). The people whose views we don't understand tend to be the people who simply don't follow politics that closely.\n\nAnd yet, that's most Americans.\n\nThis majority still votes, but not in every election. They typically vote for the same party, but not always. Their political beliefs can be all over the map: left on some issues, right on others; willing to compromise on some issues, not on others. They tend to be less partisan (which doesn't mean they're centrist), less ideological (which doesn't mean they're moderate), and less likely to see politics as a black-and-white, life-and-death struggle with clear heroes and villains (which doesn't mean they don't care). They're also less likely to have a four-year college degree, which is now the best predictor of how Americans vote and the central divide in American politics-a divide that continues to grow.\n\nThe Democratic Party is currently on the wrong side of an unforgiving math problem. Fewer than four in 10 Americans have graduated from college, and that number is even smaller in the battleground states that decide the presidency and control of Congress. In each of the past three elections, Trump has picked up millions of new votes from Americans without a degree who had previously supported Democrats. And every time, Democrats have taken comfort in explanations that, although plausible, absolve us from the hard work of winning back these voters.\n\nIn 2016, we told ourselves that the only reason white, working-class Obama voters could possibly choose Trump over Hillary Clinton was misogyny, racism, or misinformation. In 2020, Trump's gains with working-class Latinos were blamed on Cubans in Florida and COVID-19 lockdowns. In 2024, Trump won even more support from working-class Latino voters and Asian voters and Black voters. He won new votes from working-class Gen Z and Millennial voters. He made huge gains in working-class border communities and the immigrant neighborhoods of big cities.\n\nDemocrats can choose again to take comfort in an explanation that requires very little of us: If the party lost in 2024 because people were fed up with high costs and an old incumbent, maybe we can win in 2028 if people are still fed up with high costs and an old incumbent. Or maybe Democrats can just crank up the economic populism. Or sand down the edges of identity politics. Or create better ads, or hire smarter operatives, or run younger candidates, or find a Joe Rogan but without any of the stuff that makes liberals mad and Rogan popular. Surely, someone on Bluesky has the answer.\n\nThe truth is, 2024 should be a clarifying moment for those of us who have spent the past decade trying to keep Trump out of power. Half of the country just took another flier on the guy who attempted a coup-a convicted felon who somehow won 16 million more votes than he did in 2016. Democrats are about to have as little power as they've had at any time in the past two decades for a simple reason: Most Americans weren't convinced that they'd be better off under Democratic rule. That's it. And there's no shortcut back to power that avoids the difficult task of convincing people to change their minds.\n\nDemocrats need to get back into the persuasion business. Interactions with voters, frustrating as they often are, are always a good reminder of how different it feels to talk politics with a person you're genuinely trying to persuade. You don't speak in phrases from a candidate's overly polished speech or carefully worded interview answers. You don't talk like an ad that supposedly tests well but somehow sounds like every other Democratic ad you've ever heard. And the conversations certainly don't sound at all like people talk and argue about politics online. Imagine if the woman we met in Las Vegas had posted her cop-killing-immigrants question on social media. Does anyone think the resulting discourse would've won her vote-or any votes? I can't say I would've responded the same way I did in person.\n\nRead: The coming Democratic revolution\n\nPersuading voters is primarily the job of politicians and political professionals. But we now live in an era when the typical voter's occasional glimpse at the spectacle of American politics is less likely to be a candidate's speech or a campaign ad than an algorithmic assortment of takes and arguments from media figures, activists, and anyone with an opinion and a social-media account. This means that, whether we like it or not, the small minority of us who obsessively follow and talk and post about politics play a role in shaping the views of the majority of Americans who don't: a multiracial, working-class majority that has come to believe politics is largely irrelevant to their lives.\n\nAnd can we really blame them?\n\nTrump has been the main character of American politics for nearly a decade, so that certainly hasn't helped, but neither has the exhausting drama he's pulled us into, over and over again. He acts, we react, and sometimes overreact. Political obsessives see a debate in which the stakes are total and the right side is obvious. But more often than not, the person who's just checking in sees a fight that sounds both silly and sanctimonious, trivial and hyperbolic, inaccessible and exhausting-all of which feeds into the autocrat's empty promise that he can liberate us from the messier parts of a system in which everyone gets a say and nothing seems to get done.\n\nDemocrats can no longer just assert that this path is wrong; we have to show that a better way exists-yes, in the policies we propose and in the facts we present, but also in how we approach the essential work of politics in a democracy.\n\nWhen someone expresses a view we find immoral or offensive, it's not that they never deserve to be scolded or shamed. It's that making people feel unwelcome or unwanted is self-defeating and antithetical to the project of democratic governance-a radical belief that everyone has equal worth and deserves an equal voice in organizing a society where dissenting views are tolerated, minority rights are protected, and progress happens only when minds are changed.\n\nThe last time Democrats suffered a defeat of this year's magnitude was in 2004, when George W. Bush won the popular vote to secure a second term and the Republicans controlled Congress. Some people have pointed out that, at the time, the smart money was on Democrats nominating a swing-state moderate in 2008. A Black guy from Chicago named Barack Hussein Obama who had broken with his party on the Iraq War wasn't really in the cards. The suggestion is that maybe Democrats should worry less about where our next candidates fall on the political spectrum and more about whether they can rally the party faithful.\n\nBut that is based on a misconception about why Obama was the last Democratic president since Franklin D. Roosevelt to twice win an electoral majority. For all the attention on his charisma and ability to inspire, an underrated aspect of Obama's appeal was how hard he tried to empathize with the people he was trying to lead. Even if they weren't for him, he made it clear that he was for them. Part of that capacity came from navigating so many different worlds as he grew up. But part of it was his background as a community organizer.\n\nOrganizers understand better than just about anyone else in politics what it takes to change minds, because they spend their days talking with people who aren't like them, don't know them, and don't think like them. I spend way too much of my life arguing about politics online and on mic, but the disagreements I appreciate the most-the conversations that make me think differently-are almost always with people who have a background in organizing for a cause or campaign. Whether the person's politics are to the left or the right of my own, their experience tends to make them more patient, understanding, and compelling than 95 percent of social-media interactions. That's because organizers aren't looking to perform for the people who already agree with them. They're looking to persuade the people who don't. They don't just want to be right. They want to win."

      "text": "The Democrats' Working-Class Problem Gets Its Close-Up\n\nA group that spent heavily to defeat Trump is now devoting millions to study voters who were once aligned with the Democratic Party but have since strayed.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nThe distant past and potential future of the Democratic Party gathered around white plastic folding tables in a drab New Jersey conference room last week. There were nine white men, three in hoodies, two in ball caps, all of them working-class Donald Trump voters who once identified with Democrats and confessed to spending much of their time worried about making enough money to get by.\n\nAsked by the focus-group moderator if they saw themselves as middle class, one of them joked, \"Is there such a thing as a middle class anymore? What is that?\" They spoke about the difficulty of buying a house, the burden of having kids with student loans, and the ways in which the \"phony\" and \"corrupt\" Democratic Party had embraced far-left social crusades while overseeing a jump in inflation.\n\n\"It was for the people and everything, and now it is just lies,\" one man said when asked how the Democratic Party has changed.\n\nTrump, another man said, was the only one inhabiting the political center these days. But some expressed concern about how much they were benefiting from the early days of Trump's second administration, about the potential cost of new tariffs, and about the president's embrace of \"distracting\" issues such as renaming the Gulf of Mexico and planning to redevelop Gaza.\n\n\"I feel like the administration is going for things that grab headlines, like trans rights, wars, things that people pay attention to, rather than actual inflation and pricing,\" one of the men told the group. \"So that is part of the negativity of politics that I don't really enjoy.\"\n\nThe February 18 focus group, in a state that saw deep Democratic erosion last year and will elect a new governor this fall, was the first stop of a new $4.5 million research project centered on working-class voters in 20 states that could hold the key to Democratic revival. American Bridge 21st Century, an independent group that spent about $100 million in 2024 trying to defeat Trump, has decided to invest now in figuring out what went wrong, how Trump's second term is being received, and how to win back voters who used to be Democratic mainstays but now find themselves in the Republican column.\n\n\"We want to understand what are the very specific barriers for these working-class voters when it comes to supporting Democrats,\" Molly Murphy, one of the pollsters on the project, told me. \"I think we want to have a better answer on: Do we have a message problem? Do we have a messenger problem? Or do we have a reach problem?\"\n\nMitch Landrieu, a former New Orleans mayor and senior adviser to the Joe Biden White House, said the Democratic Party needs to think beyond the swing voters that were the subject of billions in spending last year and give attention to the people of all races and ethnicities who have firmly shifted away from Democrats to embrace the politics of Trump.\n\n\"The first thing you got to do is learn what you can learn, ask what you can ask, and know what you can know,\" Landrieu told me last week, before the New Jersey focus group. \"When you see it through a number of different lenses, it should help you figure out how you got it wrong.\"\n\nSince losing last fall, Democrats have railed against the price of eggs, denounced \"President Elon Musk,\" and promised to defend the \"rule of law.\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer even led a chant of \"We will win\" outside the U.S. Treasury building. But there is still little Democratic agreement about the reasons for Trump's victory or how Democrats can make their way back to power.\n\nThe Bridge plan is to launch a series of interviews with party leaders, tracking polls and meetings with voters around the country to try to figure out how best to fix the party after an election that saw Democrats lose the popular vote for the first time since 2004. Former Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez and former Representative Colin Allred of Texas, who lost a bid for the Senate last year, have signed up to work with Landrieu on the project.\n\nSeveral other parts of the Democratic power structure are searching for answers as well. The new chair of the Democratic National Committee, Ken Martin, has promised his own \"postelection review\" by the party. \"Not an autopsy, because we're not dead as a party,\" he said late last year. The details have not yet been announced.\n\nThird Way, a moderate Democratic group, ran a recent Democratic strategist retreat outside Washington to begin the conversation about how to create a new economic agenda and how to extricate the party from unpopular positions on issues such as transgender athletes and immigration enforcement. Future Forward, the largest Democratic independent spender in the 2024 campaign, has continued to circulate \"Doppler memos\" to Democratic decision makers, offering them real-time updates about how Americans are digesting Trump's actions and the most promising avenues for pushing back.\n\nThe Bridge effort emerged from a four-day Palm Beach donor retreat this month, just down the road from Mar-a-Lago. Top Democratic donors gathered for days of closed-door panels with titles such as \"What Went Wrong?,\" \"What's Going on With Men?,\" \"How to Stop Losing the Culture Wars,\" and \"Sending the Right Message: Reviving the Democratic Brand.\" A Saturday-night panel at the conference with Landrieu, Allred, and others laid out how much was still unknown. The title: \"It's All About Listening: How Can We Reconnect With the Voters We Have Lost?\"\n\n\"I just really believe you have to start from scratch. You have to throw out all of your assumptions,\" Landrieu told me. \"Whatever happened in the past is the past, and that is the last campaign. Joe Biden isn't president anymore, and they don't have Joe Biden as a foil.\"\n\nEven though the answers remain unclear, donors came away from the retreat saying they were eager to keep spending. Bridge has planned another donor conference in San Francisco for early next month. \"At a time when some Democrats are in retreat, I saw a large group of donors at Democracy Matters in Palm Beach spoiling to re-engage in the fight,\" John Driscoll, a health-care executive and an American Bridge donor, said in a statement.\n\nThe early after-action autopsy of Bridge's own spending in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania last year echoed the early findings of other groups: Advertising for Kamala Harris and against Trump had a clear marginal impact where it was targeted, but it was unable to hold back the much greater Trump gains, including significant erosion among longtime Democratic voting blocs. A Bridge analysis conducted by the Democratic data firm BlueLabs of voters in the three states found that Democratic support overall dropped 3.9 percentage points in urban counties, 2.5 points in Hispanic-dominant counties, and 2.1 in Black-dominant counties. At the same time, counties where Trump received 60 percent or more of the vote saw their vote totals rise by about 5 percent.\n\nLandrieu hopes to share early results before this year's fall elections so that new tactics and messages get a test run before next year's midterm elections.\n\nAfter the focus group of white men, Bridge gathered a similar group of eight New Jersey Latino men-Trump-supporting members of the working class who had previously voted for Democrats. One voter said that the Democratic Party has walked away from representing the working class, given rising costs. Another expressed concern about the \"woke\" rules of Democratic governance. \"People were getting hurt for any little comment, so you had to be politically correct for everything,\" he said.\n\nDemocrats have spent years trying to convince nonwhite voters that Trump's racial insensitivity should be a redline. These voters did not try to defend Trump's racial views or argue that he is not racist. But even in that was a warning for the next iteration of the Democratic Party.\n\n\"Whether he is or not, I don't care,\" one voter said. \"I vote with my pocket.\""

      "text": "Maybe Democrats Didn't Do So Badly After All\n\nThe party's debate about reinventing itself after the election has gotten more complicated.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nFive days after last month's election, Senator Chris Murphy rendered a damning verdict on his party's performance. \"That was a cataclysm,\" the Connecticut Democrat wrote on X. \"Electoral map wipeout.\" Donald Trump had won both the popular vote and the biggest Electoral College victory-312 to 226-for any Republican since 1988; Democrats had lost their Senate majority and appeared unlikely to retake the House. The Democratic Party had lost touch with far too many American voters, Murphy concluded: \"We are beyond small fixes.\"\n\nOther prominent Democrats saw a similarly sweeping repudiation of the party's brand. \"It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them,\" Senator Bernie Sanders wrote in a statement issued less than 24 hours after the polls closed. At the time of those reactions, millions of votes had yet to be counted, and several of the nation's closest House races remained uncalled. Now a clearer picture of the election has emerged, complicating the debate over whether Democrats need to reinvent themselves-and whether voters really abandoned them at all.\n\nTrump's popular-vote margin has shrunk to about 1.5 percent-one of the tightest in the past half century-and because some votes went to third-party and independent candidates, he'll fall just short of winning a majority of the vote nationwide. Compared with incumbent governments elsewhere in the world, Democrats' losses were modest . And in the House, they gained a seat, leaving the GOP with the second-smallest majority in history . A trio of Republican vacancies expected early next year will make passing Trump's agenda even more difficult , and Democrats are in a strong position to recapture the chamber in the midterm elections, when the incumbent party typically struggles.\n\nThe final results are prompting some in the party to push back against the doom-and-gloom diagnoses of Murphy, Sanders, and others who say the Democratic brand is in tatters and needs an overhaul. \"If the Democratic brand was fundamentally broken and needed to be thrown out, this election would have been a complete blowout. And it was not. It was way too close,\" Yasmin Radjy, the executive director of Swing Left, a Democratic organizing group, told me. Another Democrat, who requested anonymity in order to speak candidly, put it this way: \"We lost an election. We didn't lose the country.\"\n\nIn some areas, the election looked like a red wave; compared with four years ago, the presidential vote swung to the right by about 10 points in some of the most populous blue states, such as New York, California, and New Jersey. But down-ballot races offer a solid case for Democratic optimism. The party label appeared to be far less of an albatross for Democratic congressional candidates than it was in strong Republican years such as 2010 and 2014. In the Senate this year, although Republicans flipped four seats, Democratic candidates prevailed in four battleground states that Kamala Harris lost to Trump. And according to the Cook Political Report's David Wasserman, Democrats could have retaken the House majority with only 7,309 more votes across three congressional districts.\n\nDemocrats also held their own in state-legislative races. They made gains in Wisconsin and broke a Republican supermajority in North Carolina, although they lost ground elsewhere. Overall, the party retains significantly more power in state capitols than it did when Trump first took office in 2017. \"There could have been a red wave in the states, and there wasn't,\" Heather Williams, the president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, told me. \"I genuinely see this election as defying odds.\"\n\nRead: Democrats actually had quite a good night in North Carolina\n\nThe Democrats I spoke with over the past week were cautious in defending their party's down-ballot performance, lest they be accused of minimizing Harris's loss to a convicted felon in a race many of them had characterized as an existential referendum on American democracy. \"The stakes were so high that even getting it wrong by a few points is cataclysmic,\" Radjy acknowledged, \"and the implications for our country, for our democracy, for people's lives, are really serious.\" The party's House gains were enough to earn Representative Suzan DelBene of Washington State a second term as chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. But she was careful not to declare any sort of victory. \"We did a lot of things right,\" DelBene told me, \"but we want to be in the majority, so there's more that we can do.\"\n\nAfter seeing the full results, Murphy told me that he still considered the election a cataclysm for Democrats. His alarm stems from the party's deepening losses among working-class voters-long the backbone of the Democratic Party. That trend continued this year, and the party also lost significant ground with nonwhite voters in major cities. Murphy contends that the Democratic coalition has shrunk to the point where the party simply isn't competitive in enough places to win a majority. The outlook is particularly grim in the Senate, he said, where Democrats no longer hold any seats in a solidly red state, thanks to losses in Montana, West Virginia, and Ohio. \"Morally and intellectually, how do you continue as the party of the working class and poor when every single election, fewer of them are voting for you?\" Murphy told me. \"There becomes a real dishonesty and inauthenticity within our party if we look at this last election as too close to call or good spots and bad spots .\"\n\nMurphy believes that Democrats should respond by embracing economic populism and welcoming people who have conservative views on cultural issues such as guns, immigration, and the environment. Some of the party's successes from last month agree with him.\n\nRepresentative Pat Ryan won a competitive reelection bid in New York's Hudson Valley by 14 points, outperforming Harris by double digits. He attributed his victory to both focusing on the affordability crisis in his district and breaking with Democrats on issues such as the border. The Democratic brand has become \"toxic,\" Ryan told me. \"I certainly felt a pretty resounding message from voters that in many places, and with many candidates, we're just out of touch and in a bubble and not connected to the daily pressure, pain, struggle, challenges that the majority of people are facing.\"\n\nTyler Austin Harper: Is this how Democrats win back the working class?\n\nNot all Democrats who won tough races did so by criticizing their party. Kristen McDonald Rivet, a Michigan Democrat who outperformed Harris by nine points, said voters in her Trump-supporting district seemed to hate both parties equally. \"They are sick of politics,\" McDonald Rivet told me. \"If this election was supposed to be a message to the Democratic Party, I would have lost,\" she said.\n\nThe party is still combing through election data in search of clues as to why its candidates performed better down the ballot than at the top of the ticket, and in certain places more than others. The answers will likely determine whether the reboot that Murphy and Ryan are advocating gains momentum. \"We should not jump to conclusions,\" Radjy said. However devastating last month's defeat was for Democrats, they did not fall as far from power as many first thought."

Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nUpdated on February 1 at 10:06 ET The Democrats are angry. Well, at least some of them.\n\nFor months, party activists have felt bitter about Kamala Harris's election loss, and incensed at the leaders who first went along with Joe Biden's decision to run again. They feel fresh outrage each time a new detail is revealed about the then-81-year-old's enfeeblement and its concealment by the advisers in charge. But right now, what's making these Democrats angriest is that many of their elected leaders don't seem angry at all.\n\n\"I assumed that we would be prepared to meet the moment, and I was wrong,\" Shannon Watts, the founder of the gun-control group Moms Demand Action, told me. \"It's like they've shown up to a knife fight with a cheese stick.\"\n\nFor all the people in Watts's camp, the party's response to Donald Trump's first 12 days in office has been maddening at best and demoralizing at worst. After Trump issued pardons or commutations for the January 6 rioters last week, including the ones who attacked police officers, no immediate chorus of anger came from what is supposed to be the next generation of Democratic talent, including Maryland Governor Wes Moore, California Governor Gavin Newsom, and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, another 2028 hopeful, who is on tour selling a young-adult version of her autobiography, has told interviewers , \"I am not out looking for fights. I am always looking to collaborate.\"\n\nAfter Trump threatened Colombia with tariffs, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries attempted to reassure the confused and fearful rank and file with the reminder that \"God is still on the throne,\" which seemed a little like saying, \"Jesus, take the wheel.\" And people were baffled after the Democratic National Committee responded on X to Trump's first week in office by channeling a quainter time in American politics and dusting off an Obama-era slogan to accuse him of being \"focused on Wall Street-not Main Street.\" \"Get new material!\" one person suggested in the replies, a succinct summary of the other 1,700 comments.\n\nWill Freeman: Strong-arming Latin America will work until it doesn't\n\nThe limp messaging continued this week, after Trump's administration on Monday issued a federal-funding freeze, including for cancer research and programs such as Meals on Wheels. The next day, Jeffries called for an emergency caucus meeting to hammer out a forceful \"three-pronged counter-offensive.\" But that emergency meeting would not actually take place until the following afternoon. (By the time lawmakers were dialing in , the White House had already rescinded the order.) Jeffries's Senate counterpart, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, scowling over his glasses, offered his own sleepy-and slightly unsettling-assessment of the moment: \"I haven't seen people so aroused in a very, very long time.\"\n\nSome Democrats say they are hopeful that a new chair of the DNC, who will be elected today, will give the now-rudderless party a bit of direction-a way to harness all that arousal. The committee leads the party's fundraising apparatus and coordinates with its sister organizations on Senate and House campaigns. But a chair can't do much if the party's own lawmakers aren't willing to swap out the mozzarella for something a little sharper.\n\nPart of the hurdle for Democrats is that they are afraid of sounding shrill. Few are eager for a return of the frantic and indiscriminate alarm-sounding that characterized the response to Trump 1.0, when Democrats clamored for the release of the supposed pee tapes and wore pink pussy hats in protest. There's something cringey, these days, about reviving the capital- R Resistance-especially because Trump's second win can't be chalked up to some fluke; he won the popular vote, fair and square. Most Democrats acknowledge that, this time around, they should choose their targets carefully. \"We're not going to swing at every pitch,\" Jeffries told reporters yesterday morning.\n\nBut Democrats can't just stand idly by the plate, several frustrated progressive activists and movement leaders told me. They should be communicating to voters that Trump \"is shutting down the government, and stripping it for parts to sell to billionaires,\" April Glick Pulito, a progressive communications strategist, said. But Democrats aren't getting it across, a reality that is disheartening, she told me, but also symbolic. \"It's part of why we fuckin' lost,\" she said. \"It's why people stayed home.\" She and others I spoke with are demanding that Democrats be louder and more forceful-using resolutions and press conferences, sure, but also creative social-media campaigns and stunts for the cameras. \"Speak like normal people, on platforms that normal people access,\" Watts said. \"I am not reading your press release. Get on every platform I'm on-talk to me on an Instagram reel, or a Substack live. Tweet things that explain what's happening and how I can help or what you're going to do to fix it.\"\n\nSome Democratic lawmakers have been doing this. People I talked with pointed to Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has regularly gone live on Instagram to spell out the consequences of Trump's actions. They also pointed to Illinois Governor J. B. Pritzker's vow to thwart unlawful deportation efforts and his new directive blocking any pardoned January 6 rioters from serving in the state government.\n\nBut Democrats across the ideological spectrum say they want more from their leaders. Dullness in political messaging is death, they say, and bland consultant-speak is plaguing the party, which right now seems totally incapable of grabbing any voter's attention. A clear example of this was when Democratic leaders chose 74-year-old Gerry Connolly, who is not exactly a fiery communicator , to head up the House Oversight Committee over Ocasio-Cortez, Ezra Levin, a co-founder of the grassroots group Indivisible, told me. That choice indicates \"a failure to recognize the political and media moment that we're in.\"\n\nA party that is in the minority in both chambers of Congress usually doesn't have a prayer of blocking legislation, but it can gum up the works. Dozens of Democratic senators have so far voted in support of Trump's Cabinet nominees when they should be opposing them at every turn, these frustrated activists argue, along with rejecting unanimous consent agreements , voting against cloture , and requesting quorum calls . \"They should be slowing everything to a halt,\" Amanda Litman, a co-founder of the organization Run for Something, told me.\n\nGlick Pulito compared the Democrats' situation to a sketch from the Netflix comedy show I Think You Should Leave , in which a man wearing a hot-dog suit crashes a hot-dog-shaped car into a store and proceeds to look around wildly for the culprit. \"I don't want to see Chuck Schumer saying Congress should act,\" Glick Pulito said. \"Bro, you are Congress!\"\n\nSome signs have emerged that Democrats are developing a wartime footing. A group of 23 attorneys general from across the country sued the Trump administration this week over its funding freeze. The former vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz came out of election-loss-induced retirement to go on a cable-news rampage about it. (\"They defrosted him!\" Glick Pulito said.) And when the White House rescinded its funding block, Democrats claimed a grassroots victory. \" FAFO ,\" Ocasio-Cortez wrote on X. \"I am more optimistic now than I was 48 hours ago,\" Levin told me. \"I am seeing some green shoots. I would like those to bloom into full-fledged flowers.\"\n\nElaine Godfrey: The resistance almost missed impeachment\n\nA new DNC chair, activists and progressives leaders hope, could at least be the Miracle-Gro for that process. Since Harris lost and Biden left, Democrats have been leaderless and agenda-free. Any conversations about the party's brand troubles or its plan for handling the next four years have been haphazard and localized. Ken Martin and Ben Wikler, the two top candidates for the DNC chair job, both have the confidence of the activists I spoke with, not least because both have led political operations from outside the D.C. Beltway. Both men say they understand that people are frustrated. \"If we don't stand up now,\" Martin, head of the Minnesota Democrats, told me, \"then how in the hell are people going to believe that we're going to fight for them and their families when we're back in power?\" This is a period of transition, Wikler, the chair of the Wisconsin state party, told me: \"Very soon, the battle will be well and truly joined.\"\n\nBut the cavalry's arrival may not mean much. The DNC has always occupied an amorphous role in the Democratic Party; it holds little sway with congressional leadership, and won't exactly shape the party's ideological future. That reality was on display this week during a chaotic DNC candidate forum characterized by a fixation on diversity issues, constant interruptions from climate-change activists, and frustrated outbursts from the audience.\n\nThe scene was indicative of a party not only struggling to fill a leadership vacuum but also stumbling beneath the weight of a tarnished brand, an unhappy base, and a growing reputation for fecklessness.\n\nThis article originally misstated the DNC's role in the Democratic Party."

Sign up for it here.\n\nFor a few years, Democrats were so regimented that one could almost forget Will Rogers's well-worn quip that he was not a member of any organized political party but rather a Democrat. After Hillary Clinton's ignominious loss in 2016, the congressional team of Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer quickly took charge. They were mostly able to keep a fractious coalition together through Donald Trump's tumultuous first term. Democrats won the House in 2018 and the White House and Senate in 2020. At the start of Joe Biden's presidency, despite noisy complaints about the inconstancy of Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, the party managed to enact a huge legislative agenda.\n\nThat seems a long time ago now. The party was able to force Biden out of the 2024 race, but much too late. After Trump's win, Democrats did a great deal of hand-wringing about what went wrong, but they don't seem to have learned much. Their inability to find their footing was on painful display during last night's non-State of the Union address. Not only could Democrats not figure out an effective response to Trump's speech ; they couldn't even settle on one or two ineffective responses.\n\nFirst-term Senator Elissa Slotkin of Michigan got the unenviable duty of giving the official Democratic Party response, and delivered a workmanlike, solid speech that, as my colleague Tom Nichols wrote , nonetheless \"failed to capture the hallucinatory nature of our national politics\" and thus felt a little irrelevant.\n\nAhead of Trump's speech, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries warned his caucus not to become the story. It didn't work. This morning, the bible of Washington conventional wisdom, Politico Playbook, declared that \"the reaction in the chamber was the story.\"\n\nA few Democrats decided to skip the speech altogether, but not enough for the boycott to be apparent in footage or images from the House chamber. Dozens of women in Congress wore pink as some sort of protest , but the message was so vague as to be illegible as anything other than generic protest. Other members brandished little signs-I saw them variously mocked as church fans, auction paddles, or table-tennis paddles-with text including \" FALSE ,\" \" MUSK STEALS ,\" and \" SAVE MEDICAID .\" (They at least opted against brandishing egg cartons as a comment on inflation.) A group of Democrats invited laid-off federal workers to join them, but without the microphone, they didn't have much way to draw attention to their guests. Representative Jasmine Crockett posted a lip-synch to \"Not Like Us,\" for some reason. The scene-stealer was Representative Al Green, a veteran showman who got himself ejected for heckling Trump a few minutes in.\n\nNone of this matters a great deal in the specifics. The State of the Union (and its off-year sibling ) don't tend to have much lasting political or policy import. But the image of Democrats sitting glumly in the chamber-a mostly passive audience for Trump, neither supporting him nor meaningfully resisting him-felt like a metaphor for their broader messaging struggle. If Green's act, complete with a cane waved at the president, was a bit buffoonish, at least he looked like he cared.\n\nMy social-media feeds were flooded last night, as they have been over the past few weeks, with progressives wincing, groaning, and gnashing their teeth about Democratic fecklessness. This is not merely an online phenomenon, as MSNBC's Zeeshan Aleem recently reported . Only one in five voters approves of the party's leadership, and they're underwater even among Democrats (40 percent approve, 49 percent disapprove).\n\nPart of the problem may be that Democrats respond to each new crisis slowly. Jeffries seems to be eyeing the coming budget battle as his moment to flex power. Republicans are unlikely to be able to pass a bill that satisfies both far-right lawmakers and vulnerable moderates, which means they will need House Democrats' help to pass a bill. As a matter of tactics, Jeffries may be right, but it's a very old-school, procedural approach to a moment that Democrats are simultaneously trying to convince voters is chaotic and unprecedented.\n\nDuring his speech last night, Trump claimed a historic electoral mandate, despite one of the narrowest wins in recent memory. Democratic leaders speak like they have accepted that as true. \"I'm trying to figure out what leverage we actually have,\" Jeffries said last month. \"What leverage do we have? Republicans have repeatedly lectured America-they control the House, the Senate, and the presidency. It's their government.\"\n\nEven insofar as Jeffries is technically right, Democrats' best leverage is in motivating the roughly half of the country that voted against Trump. \"No We Can't\" is a bad way to do that. That's one reason that, as I wrote last week , the odds of a progressive equivalent to the Tea Party-a large grassroots movement that furiously opposes Republicans but also has little use for the Democratic establishment-are higher than ever.\n\nIf anything good comes from last night's speech, perhaps it will be the hastening of the end of the State of the Union, a bloated, obsolete ritual. The president is required under the Constitution to report to Congress annually, but that has taken the form of a speech only since 1913. When I was a kid, the State of the Union felt majestic: a moment of comity and decorum, where the president and Congress sat on a mostly equal footing and the focus was on policy.\n\nThose days are long gone. Hectoring-both by and directed at -the president is now standard. In a funny hot-mic moment before Trump started last night, Vice President J. D. Vance and Speaker Mike Johnson were caught joking about how hard it is to sit through a long speech on the dais. \"The hardest thing was doing it during Biden, when the speech was a stupid campaign speech,\" Johnson said.\n\nThis is an ironic remark, given the strident, partisan speech that followed, but he's not wrong: The State of the Union has become just another political rally. Several Supreme Court justices have already concluded that it's not productive, seemly, or fun to be there, and they skip. Picking a low point of Trump's speech last night is challenging-elevating himself above George Washington? Telling a debunked lie about Social Security beneficiaries? Reprised threats against Greenland and Panama?-but some of the most uncomfortable moments were a showdown between Trump and Senator Elizabeth Warren, whom he called \"Pocahontas,\" as well as Trump's repeated, needless attacks on Biden.\n\nIt's hard to think of any reason most Democrats would want to attend Trump's State of the Union next year, where they will surely be browbeaten and used as partisan props but are unlikely to learn anything new about his policy agenda. That would be a much stronger and clearer message than anything Democrats tried this year. But then again, we haven't seen the party unite much around its best interests lately.\n\nRelated:\n\nHere are four new stories from The Atlantic :\n\nToday's News\n\nEvening Read\n\nCoaching Is the New 'Asking Your Friends for Help'\n\nBy Olga Khazan\n\nThese days, if a problem exists, there seems to be a coach for it.

      "text": "Why Democrats Got the Politics of Immigration So Wrong for So Long\n\nThey spent more than a decade tacking left on the issue to win Latino votes. It may have cost them the White House-twice.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nThe election of Donald Trump this year shattered a long-standing piece of conventional wisdom in American politics: that Latinos will vote overwhelmingly for whichever party has the more liberal approach to immigration, making them a reliable Democratic constituency. This view was once so pervasive that the Republican Party's 2012 post-election autopsy concluded that the party needed to move left on immigration to win over more nonwhite voters.\n\nIf that analysis were true, then the nomination of the most virulently anti-immigration presidential candidate in modern history for three straight elections should have devastated the GOP's Latino support. Instead, the opposite happened. Latinos, who make up about a quarter of the electorate, still lean Democratic, but they appear to have shifted toward Republicans by up to 20 points since 2012. According to exit polls , Trump-who has accused South American migrants of \"poisoning the blood of our country\" and called for the \"largest deportation effort in American history\"-won a greater share of the Latino vote than any Republican presidential candidate ever . At the precinct level, some of his largest gains compared with 2020 were in heavily Latino counties that had supported Democrats for decades. And polling suggests that Trump's restrictionist views on immigration may have actually helped him win some Latino voters, who, like the electorate overall, gave the Biden administration low marks for its handling of the issue.\n\nFor more than a decade, Democrats have struck an implicit electoral bargain: Even if liberal immigration stances alienated some working-class white voters, those policies were essential to holding together the party's multiracial coalition. That bargain now appears to have been based on a false understanding of the motivations of Latino voters. How did that misreading become so entrenched in the first place?\n\nPart of the story is the rise of progressive immigration-advocacy nonprofits within the Democratic coalition. These groups convinced party leaders that shifting to the left on immigration would win Latino support. Their influence can be seen in the focus of Hillary Clinton's campaign on immigration and diversity in 2016, the party's near-universal embrace of border decriminalization in 2020, and the Biden administration's hesitance to crack down on the border until late in his presidency.\n\nThe Democratic Party's embrace of these groups was based on a mistake that in hindsight appears simple: conflating the views of the highly educated, progressive Latinos who run and staff these organizations, and who care passionately about immigration-policy reform, with the views of Latino voters, who overwhelmingly do not. Avoiding that mistake might very well have made the difference in 2016 and 2024. It could therefore rank among the costliest blunders the Democratic Party has ever made.\n\nThe notion that Latinos are single-issue immigration voters became something like conventional wisdom thanks to the 2012 presidential election. Barack Obama had won more than two-thirds of the Latino vote four years prior, only to see his approval ratings plummet with these voters over the first few years of his presidency. Then, in the summer of 2012, he signed the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals executive order promising legal protections for Dreamers-undocumented immigrants who had been brought to the country as children. This, the story goes, galvanized Latino voters just as Obama's opponent, Mitt Romney, was busy alienating them with calls for \"self-deportation.\" Obama went on to win more than 70 percent of the Latino vote that fall, and this was widely attributed to DACA. \"A crucial piece of Mr. Obama's winning strategy among Latinos was an initiative he announced in June to grant temporary reprieves from deportation to hundreds of thousands of young immigrants here illegally,\" The New York Times reported in a post-election analysis.\n\nBut Fernand Amandi, the lead Latino-focused pollster and strategist for both of Obama's presidential campaigns, told me that Obama won over Latino voters through a relentless focus on the issue they cared about above all others: the economy. Contrary to some media narratives, \"the one issue we really didn't touch was immigration,\" Amandi told me. \"It never registered as a top issue for Latinos. What they really cared about was pocketbook issues.\" For most of his first term, Obama resisted activist demands to embrace more liberal immigration policies because he believed that doing so would cost Democrats crucial votes-a stance that eventually earned him the nickname \"deporter-in-chief\" from activists. Even so, by the time Obama signed DACA, Amandi said, internal campaign polls showed him polling in the high 60s with Latinos; the executive order might have contributed a few percentage points, at best.\n\nThat version of events tracks closely with decades of polling data showing that Latinos-80 percent of whom lack a college degree-view the economy as the most important issue when voting, typically followed by other \"pocketbook\" concerns such as health care. \"In all my years polling this issue, immigration has never been close to the top issue for Latinos,\" Mark Hugo Lopez, the director of race and ethnicity research at Pew Research Center, told me. \"It rarely even breaks the top five.\"\n\nPaola Ramos: The immigrants who oppose immigration\n\nWhy, then, did so many political experts conclude otherwise? As Mike Madrid, a longtime political strategist who specializes in the Latino electorate, points out in his book, The Latino Century , nonwhite voters are typically assumed to be hyperfocused on ethnic-identity-related policies, such as affirmative action for Black voters and immigration for Latinos. This is so even though the \"Latino\" category covers an immensely diverse group of people with different cultures, migration histories, and national origins. \"The media, politicians, the public-we've all been primed to think about the Latino electorate this way for decades,\" Madrid told me. So when Obama signed DACA in 2012 and then performed strongly with Latinos, political brains were hardwired to infer causation from correlation. And survey data seemed to back that interpretation up. According to polls released by Latino Decisions, at the time a relatively new firm, DACA had indeed contributed to a spike in Latino support for Obama.\n\nThis perception provided an opening for immigration-advocacy organizations. Following the 2012 election, Latino Decisions continued to churn out polls on their behalf showing that-contrary to a large body of public-opinion research-immigration was actually the top issue for Latino voters, and that Latinos had far more liberal views on immigration policy than the rest of the electorate.\n\nLatino Decisions claimed that it understood the electorate in a way that traditional pollsters did not. Matt Barreto, one of the firm's co-founders, told me that traditional polling outfits had long made a series of methodological errors, such as conducting too few interviews in Spanish and relying on outdated methods to reach voters, that caused them to overrepresent third- and fourth-generation Latino Americans. When these problems were fixed, Barreto argued, a far more accurate portrait came into view.\n\nCritics make the opposite case: The firm, they argue, greatly over represents first- and second-generation Latinos, creating the impression of a far more immigration-focused electorate than actually exists. According to Lopez, at Pew, high-quality mainstream pollsters that offer to conduct interviews in either English or Spanish typically find that about 20 percent of Latinos choose Spanish. Latino Decisions, by contrast, regularly conducted closer to 35 percent of its interviews in Spanish, sometimes even more-a signal that it might be oversampling Spanish-speaking households. Several pollsters also complained to me that Latino Decisions isn't fully transparent about its methodology, including how it defines Latino in the first place.\n\nBut Barreto dismisses these and other criticisms, arguing that he is simply better than other pollsters at weighting the various subgroups of the Latino electorate. He pointed out that in 2010, while most polls showed Harry Reid losing his Senate seat, Latino Decisions accurately predicted that a surge of Latino support would deliver him a victory. Barreto, who is also a professor of political science at UCLA, believes that his academic expertise gives him an edge. \"Most of these other pollsters haven't published 83 academic articles on polling methodology and don't have Ph.D.s,\" he told me. \"I would invite them to attend the graduate seminar I teach on the subject.\"\n\nWithin the Democratic Party, Barreto's side won the debate. In 2015, leaders and allies of the immigration groups that had once sparred with Obama were tapped to help run Hillary Clinton's campaign. Barreto and his co-founder, Gary Segura, became her pollsters. Their influence showed: From the outset of her campaign, Clinton leaned hard into pro-immigration rhetoric and embraced an immigration agenda well to the left of Obama's, including a dramatic rollback of enforcement.\n\nThat same year, Republican voters nominated Trump. For those operating under the theory that immigration was the wedge issue for Latinos, this was seen as a political gift. Latino Decisions' pre-election polling found that Latino voters supported Clinton in record-breaking numbers. (\"Latino Voters Poised to Cast Most Lopsided Presidential Vote on Record,\" it predicted in a blog post.) If that came to pass, Florida would turn from a swing state to solidly blue, and even Texas would be in play. Latino support would drive a landslide victory.\n\nNeedless to say, that isn't what happened. In fact, exit polls suggested that Trump had received a slightly higher share of the Latino vote than Romney had four years earlier. The president-elect's anti-immigrant rhetoric had not alienated huge swaths of Latinos, and Clinton's pro-immigration agenda hadn't won them over. However, the increased salience of immigration did push working-class white voters to support Trump, helping him secure a narrow victory in the Electoral College.\n\nFrom the September 2024 issue: 70 miles in Hell\n\nThese counterintuitive findings ought to have prompted some soul-searching within the Democratic Party. Instead, they were almost immediately memory-holed. Exit polls are just as error-prone as any other survey, and many of the most influential groups and pollsters within the party spent the weeks and months following the election disputing the surprising results. \"The national exit surveys' deeply flawed methodology distorts the Latino vote,\" wrote Barreto in a Washington Post op-ed. A Latino Decisions poll taken just before the election, which showed Clinton winning Latinos by a historic 79-18 margin, was more accurate, he argued. Other advocacy groups followed suit. \"It is an insult to us as Latinos to keep hearing the media ignoring the empirical data that was presented by Latino Decisions,\" Janet Murguía, the president of National Council of La Raza (now called UnidosUS), a leading Latino advocacy group, said in a press conference days after the election.\n\nIt wasn't until years later that post-election analyses based on validated voter information would be released, confirming that the exit polls had been basically accurate: Trump had won a similar or slightly higher share of Latinos than Romney had in 2012. (Barreto disputes the accuracy of these studies, arguing that they suffer from the same biases as the rest of the competition's polling.) But by then, it was too late. The narrative that Latinos had rejected Trump because of his anti-immigration positions had taken hold.\n\nDuring the first Trump presidency, Democrats shifted sharply to the left on immigration. This was in part a response to the moral atrocity of family separation , but it went beyond just a backlash to Trump. Heading into the 2020 Democratic primary, nearly 250 progressive groups signed a letter urging politicians to endorse positions once considered beyond the pale, including decriminalizing crossing the border. In contrast to the Obama years, party leaders mostly did not push back. At a debate just a few weeks later, eight of the 10 Democratic presidential candidates onstage, including then-Senator Kamala Harris, raised their hands in support of decriminalizing the border.\n\nAlthough multiple polls found this position deeply unpopular with the public at large, Latino Decisions released its own poll showing that 62 percent of Latino debate-viewers said the decriminalization proposal made them more likely to vote for Democrats. The poll also found that Harris and Julián Castro, the candidates who had taken the most liberal immigration positions to that point, were the top choices for Latino voters. (Neither candidate would come remotely close to winning the nomination.)\n\nRogé Karma: The truth about immigration and the American worker\n\nThe eventual winner of that primary was one of the two Democrats who did not support decriminalization: Joe Biden. Still, after the primary, he hired many of the same operatives and pollsters from the Clinton 2016 campaign, and in the general election, he ran on an immigration platform well to the left of Obama's-one that included promises to reverse Trump's border policies, place a moratorium on deportations, and expand legal immigration. A September 2020 poll by Latino Decisions found that Biden was leading Trump by 42 points nationally with Latinos, a greater margin than Clinton had achieved.\n\nBiden, of course, won that election-but not thanks to improved Latino support. In fact, according to post-election studies based on validated voter information, Trump won about 38 percent of Latino voters, about nine points more than he had in 2016 and 14 points more than the Latino Decisions polling had predicted. Yet even this failed to convince Democrats that their theory of the case was wrong. Instead, a new rationalization emerged : Trump in 2020 talked about immigration much less than he had in 2016; therefore, his improved performance among Latinos could be attributed to the lower salience of the immigration issue. The coronavirus pandemic \"allowed a window for President Trump to be able to talk about other issues and move away from immigration, which was clearly something that really impacted his prospects for the Latino vote,\" explained Gabriel Sanchez, then the director of research at Latino Decisions, in a post-election interview. Besides, Democrats had won the presidency and both houses of Congress. The party had not paid a big electoral price for its slippage with Latino voters. Yet.\n\nThe Biden administration entered office with conflicting impulses on immigration. According to a former senior administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they are still in government, the president and some of his closest advisers worried that rolling back Trump-era restrictions too quickly could result in a surge of migrants that would overwhelm an already dysfunctional system. And they believed that strict border enforcement was needed to prevent a political backlash from swing voters. But some more progressive staffers, many of whom had come directly from the immigration-advocacy world, insisted that the White House had both a moral and political obligation to swiftly liberalize border policy. (This description of the administration's divisions has been confirmed by numerous reports .)\n\nThe result was an incoherent immigration policy. In the early months of the Biden presidency, the administration would sometimes keep existing restrictions in place or implement new ones; at other times, it would roll restrictions back, often without any cogent explanation.\n\nPerhaps the purest distillation of this dynamic was the administration's treatment of Title 42, a provision implemented by Trump in 2020 that allowed the administration to turn away asylum-seekers at the border on public-health grounds. When Biden entered office, he decided to keep Title 42 in place over objections from more than 100 outside groups and plenty of his own staff. A year later, as the progressive pressure continued to mount, the administration announced that it would end the policy. When a federal judge blocked that decision, the administration assured its allies that it would appeal the decision and fight it in court. A few months later, however, in October 2022, the administration reversed course and expanded the use of Title 42. Then, in May 2023, the administration rolled all of that back, allowing Title 42 to expire without any clear plan to replace it. In the following months, border crossings spiked to all-time highs.\n\nMeanwhile, public opinion was taking a right turn against immigration. In 2020, 28 percent of Americans told Gallup that immigration should decrease. Just four years later, that number has risen to 55 percent, the highest level since 2001.\n\nRogé Karma: The most dramatic shift in U.S. public opinion\n\nLatinos were no exception. Contrary to conventional wisdom, Latinos' views on border security have long been similar to the general population's. During the Biden administration, Latinos have lurched to the right along with the rest of the country. A Pew poll in March 2024 found that 75 percent of Latinos described the recent increase in border crossings as a \"major problem\" or a \"crisis.\" In June, a survey found that Latino voters in battleground states were more likely to trust Trump to handle immigration than Biden. And in focus groups, many Latino immigrants expressed resentment toward what they saw as preferential treatment for recent migrants. Immigration, long believed to be Democrats' secret weapon with Latino voters, had become an outright liability.\n\nEventually, the administration realized its mistake. In June, over the loud objections of progressive immigration groups, Biden signed a series of executive actions to stem the flow of migrants. Within months, border crossings reached their lowest levels since Trump was in office. When Kamala Harris took over from Biden as the Democratic nominee, she tacked to the right on immigration, touting her prosecutorial background and promising to \"fortify\" the southern border.\n\n\"The idea that Kamala Harris lost this election because she caved to progressive immigration groups is completely false,\" said Barreto, who in 2021 left Latino Decisions with Segura to co-found a new firm, BSP Research, and who served as a pollster for both the Biden and Harris 2024 campaigns. \"They were pushing us to run to the left on immigration to win over Latinos. And we ignored them because our internal polling was showing the opposite.\"\n\nBut Democrats had spent the better part of a decade listening to those groups-and to Barreto's polling done on their behalf. With just over 100 days to campaign, the vice president couldn't distance herself from the policies of the administration she had helped run. In one post-election survey, Blueprint, a Democrat-aligned firm, found that the second most important reason that voters (including Latinos) offered for not voting for Harris was \"too many immigrants illegally crossed the border under the Biden-Harris administration.\" (The top issue, by a single-point margin, was inflation.) Another Blueprint survey found that 77 percent of swing voters who chose Trump believed that Harris would decriminalize border-crossing-perhaps because she had endorsed that position during the 2020 campaign. \"Both the Biden and Harris campaigns eventually realized that they had been sold a bag of goods by these immigration groups,\" Madrid tells me. \"But it was too late. You can't reverse years of bad policy and messaging in a few months.\"\n\nProgressive groups argued for years that increasing the salience of immigration would help Democrats win the Latino vote. In 2024, they got exactly what they'd wished for: Immigration soared toward the top of the list of voter priorities, while Donald Trump centered his campaign around rabidly anti-migrant policies and rhetoric. But instead of winning Latino votes in a landslide, Democrats won their smallest share of them in at least 20 years, if not ever. Some of the statistics are hard to believe. Take Starr County, Texas, which is 98 percent Latino. In 2012, Barack Obama carried the county by 73 points. In 2024, Trump won it by 16 points.\n\nWe will never know whether the outcome of last month's election would have been different if Biden had acted sooner on the border, or if Democrats hadn't become seen as the weak-on-immigration party over the previous decade. But given how close the final margin was-Trump won Pennsylvania, the tipping-point state, by just 1.7 percentage points-the possibility can't be ruled out. \"There's a Shakespearean element to all of this,\" said Fernand Amandi, the former Obama pollster: Well-intentioned activists, fighting to make immigration policy more humane, \"inadvertently helped return to power the most anti-immigration president in modern history.\"\n\nStephen Hawkins and Daniel Yudkin: The perception gap that explains American politics\n\nSimply blaming \"the groups\" would be unfair. Activists are supposed to push the boundaries of the politically possible, even when that means embracing positions deemed unpopular. The job of politicians and parties is to understand what their constituents want, and to say no when those desires don't match up with activists' demands. Over the past decade, Democratic leaders appear to have lost the ability to distinguish between the two categories. They seem to have assumed that the best way to represent Latino voters would be to defer to the groups who purported to speak for those voters. The problem is that the highly educated progressives who run and staff those groups, many of whom are themselves Latino, nonetheless have a very different set of beliefs and preferences than the average Latino voter.\n\nDemocrats have begun to correct this error, and some liberal immigration advocates have taken the 2024 results as a prompt for an internal reckoning. \"It's imperative that the immigration movement comes together to reflect about the path forward and the kinds of policies that are realistic in the near term for our community,\" Vanessa Cárdenas, the executive director of America's Voice, an immigration-reform nonprofit, told me. \"For a very long time, if candidates even bothered to reach out to Latino voters, they would focus on immigration, even though economic issues have always been the top issue,\" Clarissa Martínez de Castro, the vice president of the Latino Vote Initiative at UnidosUS, a Latino civil-rights organization, told me. \"That was a mistake.\"\n\nThe 2024 election might have finally disabused Democrats of the notion that they can take the Latino vote for granted. Their job now is to do what democracy requires: earn it."

Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nUpdated at 12:47 p.m. ET on February 3, 2025\n\nDemocrats spent more than $20 million last year to end then-Representative Lori Chavez-DeRemer's congressional career. Now, however, the Republican they worked so hard to defeat is their favorite nominee for President-Elect Donald Trump's Cabinet.\n\nTrump's selection of Chavez-DeRemer for labor secretary came as a pleasant surprise to many Democrats and union leaders, who expected him to follow past Republican presidents and name a conservative hostile to organized labor. But Chavez-DeRemer endeared herself to unions during her two years in Congress. A former mayor of an Oregon suburb who narrowly won her seat in 2022, she was one of just three House Republicans to co-sponsor the labor movement's top legislative priority: a bill known as the PRO Act, which would make unionizing easier and expand labor protections for union members.\n\nAfter Chavez-DeRemer's nomination was announced, two senior Democratic senators, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Patty Murray of Washington State, issued cautiously optimistic statements about her-a rare sentiment for Democrats to express about any Trump nominee. In addition, Sean O'Brien, the Teamsters president who spoke at last year's Republican National Convention and whose union stayed neutral in the presidential race after repeatedly backing Democratic nominees, has championed Chavez-DeRemer's nomination. And it has given more progressive union leaders hope that, after winning the largest vote share from union households of any Republican in 40 years, Trump might change how his party treats the labor movement.\n\nAnnie Lowrey: The rise of the union right\n\n\"It's a positive move for those of us who represent workers and who want workers to have a better life,\" Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers and a close ally of Democratic Party leaders, told me. She noted that Chavez-DeRemer bucked her party not only by supporting the PRO Act but also by voting against private-school vouchers and cuts to public-education funding.\n\nTrump courted union members throughout his campaign, seeing them as a key part of a blue-collar base that helped him flip states such as Michigan and Pennsylvania, which Joe Biden won in 2020. In September, his running mate, J. D. Vance, told reporters that the drop in private-sector union membership in recent decades was \"a tragedy\"-a statement sharply at odds with the GOP's long-running advocacy of laws that would make unionizing harder, including in Vance's home state of Ohio. O'Brien and congressional Republicans reportedly pushed for Trump to pick Chavez-DeRemer after the election. The decision may have been a reward for the Teamsters' snub of Kamala Harris.\n\nYet until his selection of Chavez-DeRemer, Trump's support for unions had stopped at rhetoric. He's surrounded himself with conservative billionaires and generally sided with business interests by opposing minimum-wage increases, enhanced overtime pay, and other policies backed by organized labor. With that record in mind, Democrats have added qualifiers to their embrace of Chavez-DeRemer. \"If Chavez-DeRemer commits as labor secretary to strengthen labor unions and promote worker power,\" Warren said in her statement, \"she's a strong candidate for the job.\"\n\nThat remains a big if . A spokesperson for the Trump transition, Aly Beley, told me that Chavez-DeRemer no longer supports the PRO Act-a major shift that will disappoint Democrats but might help her secure the GOP support she needs to win confirmation. \"President Trump and his intended nominee for secretary of labor agree that the PRO Act is unworkable,\" Beley said. (After this article was published, Beley told me that, in fact, Chavez-DeRemer does not oppose the legislation and \"will support the president's agenda if confirmed as labor secretary.\")\n\nFor the same reasons that Democrats like Chavez-DeRemer, conservatives are concerned and have pushed her to renounce her pro-union stances before Republicans agree to vote for her. \"This is the one that stands out like a sore thumb,\" Grover Norquist, the conservative activist and president of Americans for Tax Reform, told me of her nomination. Her support for the PRO Act, Norquist said, reflected \"very bad judgment.\" An anti-union group, the National Right to Work Committee, wrote in a letter to Trump before he announced Chavez-DeRemer's nomination that she \"should have no place\" in his administration: \"She would not be out of place in the Biden-Harris Department of Labor, which completely sold out to Big Labor from the start.\"\n\nIn the Senate, Chavez-DeRemer's nomination is not moving nearly as quickly as those of other Trump picks. The Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee (HELP), which oversees the Labor Department, has not scheduled her confirmation hearing. (Republicans have prioritized hearings for Trump's national-security nominees.) And she hasn't met with the committee's chair, Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, who issued a noncommittal statement after her nomination was announced. \"I will need to get a better understanding of her support for Democrat legislation in Congress that would strip Louisiana's ability to be a right to work state, and if that will be her position going forward,\" Cassidy posted on X. Rand Paul, who also serves on the committee and is the leading sponsor of major anti-union legislation, has said little publicly about Chavez-DeRemer-and didn't respond to a request for comment-but his chief strategist replied to the post, urging Cassidy to \"stop her.\" (Cassidy has been similarly lukewarm about another nominee within the committee's jurisdiction: Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's pick for health and human services secretary.)\n\nChavez-DeRemer added her name to the PRO Act only a few months before last year's election. Norquist speculated that she did so to appease unions in her district in the hopes of keeping her seat. If that was her strategy, it failed: Chavez-DeRemer lost to Democrat Janelle Bynum after one of the most expensive campaigns in the country.\n\nOther Republicans see Chavez-DeRemer's pro-labor stances as sincere, not strategic. A former colleague of hers, Representative Cliff Bentz of Oregon, praised her nomination and said that Trump had picked her for the Labor Department not in spite of her close ties to unions but because of them. \"The fact that President-Elect Trump reached out to labor shows that he understands the need to create a better relationship between labor on the one hand and Republican folks on the other,\" he told me. \"And he saw in Lori exactly what he is trying to do.\" Bentz said he would be surprised if Chavez-DeRemer \"walks much of anything back.\"\n\nBut Chavez-DeRemer wouldn't be the first Trump Cabinet nominee to disavow a past position in order to win over Republican skeptics in the Senate. Tulsi Gabbard, the nominee for director of national intelligence, reversed her opposition to a key surveillance tool known as FISA Section 702, which was enacted after the September 11 terrorist attacks. And Kennedy is reportedly softening his long-standing attacks on vaccines in meetings with GOP senators.\n\nRead: America's class politics have turned upside down\n\nIf Chavez-DeRemer turns against the PRO Act, Democrats and unions will surely cool on her, but they won't be shocked. Union leaders told me that they were under no illusions that Republicans would completely retract their hostility toward the labor movement, even if her nomination represented a move in that direction. \"We have seen Project 2025,\" Jody Calemine, the director of advocacy for the AFL-CIO, said. \"That agenda is anti-worker to its very core.\"\n\nHow much influence Chavez-DeRemer would have in an administration populated by corporate leaders is unclear. The PRO Act, for example, is unlikely to go anywhere in a Republican-controlled Congress even with a supportive labor secretary, and Norquist expects that the White House will exert tight control over policies enacted by Cabinet leaders, as it has during recent administrations of both parties.\n\nTo progressives, Chavez-DeRemer is clearly preferable to some of the other names Trump reportedly considered for labor secretary. Most notably, these include Andrew Puzder, the fast-food CEO whose nomination in 2017 collapsed amid ethical conflicts, revelations that he employed an undocumented immigrant as a housekeeper, and reports of labor-law violations at his company's restaurants. She is also seen as friendlier to unions than either of Trump's labor secretaries during his first term, Alexander Acosta and Eugene Scalia.\n\nChavez-DeRemer might be the best nominee Democrats can get under Trump. But labor leaders such as Weingarten will be watching closely to see how she squares her recent support for union-friendly legislation with an administration that is, in other key positions, empowering business leaders and billionaires. \"This is where the rubber hits the road about whether the parties stay in their own preexisting camps\" with regard to labor, Weingarten told me. She said she would lobby Democratic senators to support Chavez-DeRemer if the nominee sticks by her pro-union positions. But if she renounces them, Weingarten said, \"then all bets are off.\""

      "text": "Is This How Democrats Win Back the Working Class?\n\nEmbracing populism could help the party build a lasting political coalition-if the Republicans don't do it first.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nUpdated at 6:12 p.m. ET on December 12, 2024\n\nA week after Donald Trump won the presidency again, I sat across from Chris Murphy in his minimalist but well-appointed D.C. office. The Connecticut senator sounded like a man who had done a speedrun through all five stages of grief and was ready to talk about what comes next: how his party could learn from its loss and win over-or win back-voters in 2026 and 2028. \"I have thought for a long time that there's a race between the Republican Party and the Democratic Party,\" Murphy told me. \"And the question is: Does the Republican Party become more economically populist in a genuine way before the Democratic Party opens itself up to people who don't agree with us on 100 percent of our social and cultural issues?\"\n\nMurphy is onto something. The politics of the average American are not well represented by either party right now. On economic issues, large majorities of the electorate support progressive positions: They say that making sure everyone has health-care coverage is the government's responsibility (62 percent), support raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour (62 percent), strongly or somewhat support free public college (63 percent), and are in favor of federal investment in paid family and medical leave  (73 percent). They also support more government regulation of a variety of industries including banking (53 percent), social media (60 percent), pharmaceuticals (68 percent), and artificial intelligence (72 percent). Yet large majorities of this same American public also take conservative positions on social issues: They think the Supreme Court was right to overturn affirmative action (68 percent), agree that trans athletes should compete only on teams that match their gender assigned at birth (69 percent), believe that third-trimester abortions should be illegal in most circumstances (70 percent), and are at least somewhat concerned about the number of undocumented immigrants entering the country (79 percent).\n\nThese facts are not especially convenient for either Democrats or Republicans, which is no doubt why both sides have failed to put forward platforms that represent these views. But lately, more political insiders from both parties have been willing to acknowledge the problem and admit that it's time to move on from neoliberalism, the political ideology that champions market solutions, deregulation, the privatization of public services, and a general laissez-faire approach to the economy.\n\nRead: America's class politics have turned upside down\n\nSubstantial obstacles confront populists on both the left and right. Democrats must contend with a college-educated base and party establishment that embraces maximalist positions on social issues, while Republicans must contend with substantial libertarian cliques. But whichever party figures out how to advance a meaningful post-neoliberal platform could unlock a winning and durable political coalition.\n\nMurphy is doing his best to make sure that his side of the aisle beats the Republicans, but he seems far from certain that it will. In an MSNBC interview after the election, the senator sketched out something of a road map for Democrats: \"We should return to the party we were in the '70s and '80s, when we had economics as the tent pole and then we let in people who thought differently than us on other social and cultural issues.\" Murphy was quick to add that this reinvention-or rather, reversion-will be challenging to pull off. \"That's a difficult thing for the Democratic Party to do, because we've applied a lot of litmus tests over the years,\" he observed. \"Those litmus tests have added up to a party that is pretty exclusionary and is shrinking, not growing.\"\n\nI n the days and weeks after the election, I spoke with post-neoliberal economists, academics, and leaders of major political nonprofits on the left and the right. Almost all of those I interviewed shared Murphy's view that America's political parties are in an arms race to capture what the senator called, in a 2022 essay for The New Republic , the \"silent majority of Americans who want more economic control, more social connection, and more moral markets.\"\n\nIt is a race that some worry the Republicans are winning. Although few on the populist right view Trump as the genuine article-they tend to politely describe the president-elect as a \"transitional figure\"-he has nominated post-neoliberal and populist sympathizers to major positions in his second administration: Senator Marco Rubio, an industrial-policy aficionado , for secretary of state; the pro-union Representative Lori Chavez-DeRemer for labor secretary; the Big Tech skeptic Gail Slater to lead the Justice Department's antitrust division; and, of course, J. D. Vance, whose rise to vice president-elect was greeted with trepidation by Wall Street despite his tech-venture-capital background. Still, most of those I interviewed shared the view that Trump will likely squander his populist goodwill with tax cuts for billionaires and other anti-populist agenda items during his term.\n\nThis should produce an opening for the populist left, but there remains a deeper and perhaps more intractable problem: The GOP appears to be locking into place a multiracial coalition of the non-college-educated. These are voters who may prove easier for liberals to lose than to win back. If the Democrats have any hope of once again being the party of the working class, Murphy and others believe, they need to recognize that Americans are desperate for meaning and community.\n\nThe language Murphy used in his New Republic essay-invoking morality, self-worth, and social connection-is omnipresent in post-neoliberal discourse. The movement's chief exponents believe that neoliberalism has not only created an economic disaster, but its emphasis on ruthless individualism has also created a crisis of political and social meaning. In the view of Murphy and others, any post-neoliberal politics must cultivate a new social ethic rooted in dignified and fairly remunerated labor. Many of these prominent post-neoliberals, some of them affiliated with the same think tanks and nonprofits that once helped establish the neoliberal consensus, seem convinced that there's a massive voting bloc waiting to be activated: Americans who are moderate or even small-c conservative on social issues, but who also favor a more aggressive, rabble-rousing attack on the country's existing economic system.\n\n\"We have not convinced voters in this country that we are serious about redistributing power from people who have it to people who don't have it,\" Murphy lamented to me. \"The solutions we've proposed are largely small-ball, largely adjustments to the existing market. We don't talk about power in the way that Republicans talk about power.\" Others agreed.\n\nAlthough many observed that Joe Biden has been arguably the most pro-labor president in decades and has often broken with neoliberal orthodoxy in areas such as industrial policy, they also felt that he never quite captured the narrative or claimed credit for his substantial accomplishments. In other words: There was a widespread sense among the people I spoke with that Biden had working-class policies without working-class politics. \"The Democratic Party didn't show that it was really backing the concerns of ordinary people strongly enough, and wasn't identifying well enough with how they saw the world,\" Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel Prize-winning economist and longtime critic of neoliberalism, told me.\n\nJon Favreau: The conversation Democrats need to have\n\nFor many (though not all) post-neoliberals, the heart of their economic vision is \"pre-distribution,\" a concept popularized by the political scientist Jacob Hacker. Whereas center-left neoliberals tend to favor redistributive tax-and-transfer policies-allowing an unchained market to generate robust growth, and then blunting resulting economic disparities by taking some of the gains from the system's winners and redistributing them to the system's working-class \" losers ,\" reducing inequality after the fact-post-neoliberals generally believe that it is better to avoid generating such inequalities in the first place. \"The moral of this story,\" Hacker explains in a 2011 paper , \"is that progressive reformers need to focus on market reforms that encourage a more equal distribution of economic power and rewards even before government collects taxes or pays out benefits.\"\n\nAs Hacker (perhaps accidentally) implies with his invocation of the story's \"moral,\" pre-distribution advocates often justify this strategy in ethical or even spiritual terms: Empowering workers to secure better pay and working conditions-say, through unions and sectoral bargaining-is about restoring dignity and revitalizing labor-based forms of community.\n\n\"Most people don't want a handout,\" Chris Murphy recently posted on social media. \"They want the rules unrigged so they can succeed on their own.\" Although some on the left (not unreasonably) disliked the way the senator described certain redistributionist policies as \"handouts,\" these vocabulary complaints distract from Murphy's deeper point. Honest labor is a source of pride, and populists should want an economy where most Americans are paid fairly for work they feel good about rather than suffering poverty wages and waiting for cash floats that keep them above water.\n\n\"Most people need opportunities for meaningful work and social recognition in order to feel that their goals in life are worthwhile,\" the philosopher Daniel Chandler observed in his recent book Free and Equal , which received coverage in both mainstream liberal and left-wing media. \"By focusing on increasing market incomes, especially from employment, predistribution helps to maintain the healthy connection between contribution and reward that might be lost if we relied too heavily on redistribution. At the same time, it takes seriously the importance of work for people's sense of self-respect.\" As Chandler and others see it, many Democrats' inability to grasp the fact that it matters to people not only that they have financial resources but how they acquire them has left the party unable to understand why voters don't reward them for their largesse. Larry Kramer, a former president of the Hewlett Foundation and the current president of the London School of Economics, echoed this view. He insisted to me that reaching the working class is about more than just material conditions: \"It's not economic. It's political economy .\" In his telling, liberals get so wrapped up debating how the economy should be organized that we forget to ask what moral and political ends-that is, what vision of the good life and what kinds of values-markets are supposed to secure in the first place.\n\nM any Democratic insiders believe that post-neoliberal economic policies alone are not sufficient to win back American workers. Social issues will also need to be reconsidered. Stiglitz pointed to immigration as one place where Democrats may need to compromise, a view he shares with others in his post-neoliberal cohort. Murphy helped write a defeated bipartisan border-security bill that would have added Border Patrol officers and made asylum standards more stringent; some critics characterized it as \"hard-right.\" Last year, a hotly discussed book by the socialist journalist John B. Judis and the liberal political scientist Ruy Teixeira likewise packaged a withering critique of neoliberalism with a call to embrace more conservative positions on immigration. Chandler's Free and Equal also quietly endorsed claims that increased immigration depresses wages for low earners and strains public resources. As Chandler argues, \"High levels of immigration can make it more difficult to create a stable sense of political community and national identity.\"\n\nGun control is another area where flexibility may be prudent in order to be competitive in certain parts of the country. Democrats will have to accommodate people like Dan Osborn, the independent who, though he lost his bid to represent Nebraska in the Senate, outperformed Kamala Harris while combining a vocal defense of the Second Amendment with proudly pro-union politics.\n\nTeixeira and Judis flagged a third topic, gender identity, where Democrats ought to respond to the public's concerns. That begins by making room for conversations that don't involve accusations of bigotry, or insisting that the very act of asking questions about terms such as people with the capacity for pregnancy is tantamount to challenging the right of trans Americans to exist or exposing them to harm. For Judis and Teixeira, that requires making more granular distinctions between culture-war battles such as fairness in sports-where good-faith disagreement is possible-and important efforts to provide trans Americans the kind of universalist safeguards won in earlier civil-rights movements. LGBTQ groups' effort to \"protect transgender people from discrimination in housing, employment, and school admission falls well within America's democratic tradition,\" they write. But they also warn that activist demands outside this scope are \"attempt[s] to impose a new social conformity based on a dubious notion of gender.\"\n\nMore than anything, liberals need to understand that many Americans-especially those in the working class-feel unheard. Their trust will be won back not through quick fixes, but by treating those without a college education or with more conservative social views as equal participants in our national dialogue.\n\n\"T he debate is still alive inside our party. But the post-neoliberals are clearly ascendant,\" Murphy told me. He argued that his fellow Democrats need to be more open to dissenting viewpoints, and that expanding the tent will involve a fight: \"I am not making an argument that the core Democratic Party do a left turn and reorient our position on choice, climate, or guns. I am arguing that we allow people into the tent ... so that we have a little bit more robust conversation, and potentially a little bit more diversity on those issues inside the coalition.\"\n\nThe soul-searching that is before the Democrats will require liberals to engage with views they find discomfiting, and to reckon with the fact that their social values are out of keeping with the working-class majorities they profess to represent. Democrats must figure out where there is room to compromise. And where compromise is not possible-or truly unjust-they must begin the slow-grinding work of persuasion.\n\nRead: The Democrats' billionaire mistake\n\n\"We cannot successfully engage with people whose inner lives we do not even try to understand,\" a recent report from the stalwartly liberal think tank the Roosevelt Institute concludes. Whether left-wing liberals are open to doing this remains to be seen.\n\n\"It's not clear that if we blow it in two or four years time that there's another shot at this apple for Dems,\" Jennifer Harris, a Hewlett Foundation director and former Biden-administration official, suggested, speaking in a personal capacity, when describing the Democratic Party's need for a post-neoliberal makeover. In her view, the prize for such a transformation may prove to be not just a near-term political victory, but a Franklin D. Roosevelt-style stranglehold on the electorate: \"There is potentially a lot of political spoils.\"\n\nSpoils indeed. Many on the left and right agree that the stakes are high, the reward prodigious, and the path forward obvious: Whichever party can credibly combine economic populism with moderate social positions will win elections. There is no mystery here. The problem is not the absence of a political solution but a deficit in political willpower. And the next election, and the elections to come, may well hinge on which party can muster the resolve to finally deliver real populism to the people."

He notes that despite Republicans holding all three branches of the federal government, Trump has mainly used executive orders and other decrees to impose his will instead of using legislation. \"They're trying to create a precedent that presidents cannot be constrained at all,\" he says of the party's strategy. He also faults Democrats for failing to effectively oppose the administration. \"What is the Democratic Party for? What does it support? What does it advocate for? There's not really much of an answer right now.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nOne month into Donald Trump's second presidency, he's mostly governed through executive orders and carried out his agenda with sweeping cuts by the richest man in the world, Elon Musk, the billionaire, and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency, all of which has generated a slew of protests, lawsuits, judicial rebukes.\n\nThis week, Trump shared an illustration of himself wearing crown, with the headline \"Long Live the King\" - it looked like a Time magazine cover - as he cheered his administration's move to end congestion pricing in New York.\n\nOn Tuesday, Elon Musk defended his work to gut whole agencies across the federal government in a joint interview with President Trump on Fox News.\n\nELON MUSK : I think what we're seeing here is the sort of - the thrashing of the bureaucracy as we try to restore democracy and the will of the people.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Meanwhile, a court filing from the White House Office of Administration lists Elon Musk as a senior adviser to the president who's serving as an employee of the White House office, not DOGE , which the White House previously said he was leading.\n\nTo discuss this and much more, as Elon Musk holds up a chainsaw at the CPAC summit that just took place, we're joined by David Sirota, founder and editor-in-chief of The Lever , former senior communications adviser and speechwriter for Bernie Sanders. His recent pieces for The Lever are headlined \"Trump Just Limited Your Payout for Airline Mishaps,\" \"Elon Doesn't Want You to Know His DEI Past,\" and \"Musk Just Scored More Government Cash While Pushing Education Cuts.\"\n\nWell, you're here for a big podcast convention. You were talking about climate. But talk about what's happening right now and the level of resistance.\n\nDAVID SIROTA : I think what we have to understand is that - and the question that we have to ask is: Why is Donald Trump behaving the way he's behaving when his party already controls Congress and the courts? What is the point of trying to do what he's doing without going through the normal process of legislating? Right? If you want to close down the Department of Education, if you want to close down the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the way to try to do that is through legislation, through passing it through Congress, having the law upheld in court. His party controls those institutions. So why hasn't the White House tried to do that through the normal process?\n\nAnd I think if you step back, what you see is what they're trying to do is create the precedent that a president can do whatever a president wants, that it's not a coequal branch of government, that essentially it is a king, an elected king. And I think they're relying on the idea that people, or at least their base, doesn't necessarily know or care about what the difference between a president in a coequal branch of government is versus an elected monarch. They're trying to create a precedent that presidents cannot be constrained at all.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And your response to Elon Musk saying, \"We're talking about the thrashing of the bureaucracy as we try to restore democracy\"? I mean, you watch Fox, and all they're talking about is laughing about people getting \"DOGEd.\" They're cutting the fat out. You're not hearing about what the services are that are being slashed, sliced and diced across this country.\n\nDAVID SIROTA : This is an old tactic. This reminds me of the Gingrich era. Newt Gingrich, when he rose to power in Congress, would come out and pick out one or two science projects that sounds, on its face, ridiculous. \"Oh, the government's spending $2 million to study cow flatulence. Oh, this means that the entire government is wasteful.\" Meanwhile, there's a reliance that there's not an understanding of what scientific research ends up developing. And I think they're applying that across the board.\n\nAnd we have to ask the question: Well, why? The richest man in the world is also one of the largest government contractors. So there's an inherent conflict of interest - or, in the case of the Trump administration, I guess, an alignment of interest. The more you cut public services, the more it creates, essentially, the impetus to hire private contractors. And the guy who's doing the overseeing of the cutting happens to be one of the largest private contractors.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You recently said on social media, quote, \"It's not really a political party at this point. It's better understood as a country club, with status perks for its emeritus leaders,\" and referring to the Democratic Party, in response to news that former VP, presidential candidate Kamala Harris had signed with CAA to represent her on her post-White House initiatives, including speaking engagements and possible book deals.\n\nDAVID SIROTA : Look, the Democratic Party doesn't seem to be interested in changing, at least not yet. They reelected their same leaders who oversaw the policy and party positioning that led to Trump's reelection. That's the same leadership that led to Trump's first election in 2016. The party doesn't seem interested in changing how it approaches its own voters or its own effort to win elections. There's some lip service to the middle - to the working class, but there's not really a change in policy.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : What do you make of Senator Sanders now going around the country and speaking in red districts that are most vulnerable? He says, \"If we can turn around three,\" he says, they've ended their extremely narrow lead in the House.\n\nDAVID SIROTA : Yeah, look, I think Bernie Sanders is doing the right thing. It's an example of what the Democrats at large should be doing, which is actually going into and trying to speak to the disaffected working class, that used to be the base of the Democratic Party.\n\nThe problem is that the Democratic Party, its leaders, are caught between the demands of their donors and the demands of voters, which is why so often the Democratic leadership sounds incoherent. If you're trying to address what voters want, but also trying to enrich or appease your donors, you often sound like you stand for nothing. I mean, can we actually explain or answer the question: What do the Democrats stand for right now, other than, in theory, rhetorically being against Trump, even though they're giving votes to confirm some of his nominees? Like, I think the average person has trouble even articulating: What is the Democratic Party for? What does it support? What does it advocate for? There's not really much of an answer right now.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You had a recent piece on Elon Musk's previous support for DEI policies at Tesla.\n\nDAVID SIROTA : Yeah. Well, look, only a few years ago, Tesla was touting itself as weaving DEI into its DNA . That's a quote out of a large report that came out from Tesla. Obviously, the politics have shifted. Donald Trump is trying to demonize DEI as a way to appeal to the working class, and the Democrats haven't made an effective argument on economics to also try to appeal to the working class. And right now if both parties aren't really making an economic appeal, then Trump is relying on making an identity appeal.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : In this last 20 seconds, what do you think is most important right now?\n\nDAVID SIROTA : The most important thing is for the Democrats to try to gum up the works, to stop what's going on. They don't have a lot of power. And it's also important to understand that if Donald Trump is going outside of the institutions of government, then the Democrats are going to have to rely on different kinds of tactics that don't just rely on just press conferences in the U.S. Senate.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Do you think it's possible Republicans in the House and Senate will turn on Trump?\n\nDAVID SIROTA : I don't believe it's going to happen. I just - there's no historical precedent for the Republicans to bail out on their own president.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : David Sirota, founder and editor-in-chief of The Lever , we want to thank you so much for being with us, and we will link to your articles at democracynow.org.

Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, a professor of African American studies at Princeton University, says the blame lies squarely on the Harris campaign, which refused to differentiate itself from unpopular incumbent President Joe Biden. \"The problem here is with the leadership of the Democratic Party,\" adds John Nichols, national affairs correspondent for The Nation . Nichols and Taylor discuss how Democrats \"demobilized\" young voters and grassroots organizers, to their electoral detriment. \"Donald Trump, as a president who has very few guardrails, has the potential to take horrific actions,\" says Nichols. For those seeking to oppose him, says Taylor, \"There's a lot of rebuilding that has to be done.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : To talk more about Donald Trump's victory over Kamala Harris and what it means for the country and the world, we are joined by three guests. John Nichols is The Nation 's national affairs correspondent. He's joining us from Madison, Wisconsin. Wisconsin voted for Trump. Rami Khouri is a Palestinian journalist, a senior public policy fellow at the American University of Beirut. He's also a nonresident senior fellow at the Arab Center Washington DC. And in Philadelphia, we're joined by Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, professor in the Department of African American Studies at Princeton University. Professor Taylor is contributing writer at The New Yorker magazine.\n\nKeeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, let's begin with you in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, which has been decided. Pennsylvania has gone to Trump. Can you share your response to what has taken place?\n\nKEEANGA - YAMAHTTA TAYLOR : Well, I have to say that on some level it's shocking that someone like Trump could be back in this position, but it's not really surprising. I've written about, really since the Democratic National Convention, that the Democratic Party was playing a dangerous game, that - essentially downplaying the base in order to reach for new centrist voters to try to appeal to Republicans. And we can see with some of the preliminary exit polls that that was an abject failure, that Republicans voted for Republicans. Democrats voted for Democrats.\n\nBut I think, overall, the Democratic Party really underestimated the extent to which lots of people in this country are in crisis. I think that they have insisted for months, from when Biden was running throughout, that the economy is good, that they had overcome the issues with inflation and that things were looking up. And those are the voters that they appealed to. But if you look at the exit polls, the at least preliminary exit polls, there was a total washout with working-class voters. People making between $30,000 and $50,000, people making under $100,000 went to Trump. And I think that there's a rise in homelessness, historic rise - historically high rise in homelessness from 2023 to 2024, and on pace to exceed that this year. Rent is 20% higher today than it was in 2020. Hunger, hunger insecurity on the rise compared to even just a year ago. And for even when the extent to the crisis doesn't express itself in that way, in the first quarter of this year, Americans took on $17 trillion in personal debt. And so, this is completely unstable.\n\nAnd Kamala Harris had very little to say about that. She was running as an incumbent, trying to distance herself from those aspects of the Biden administration, but really unable to do so, really unwilling to chart a different course, to articulate how things would be different under her administration. And they are really - you know, we are seeing and dealing with the consequences of that today.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Keeanga, I wanted to ask you about the -\n\nKEEANGA - YAMAHTTA TAYLOR : Yeah.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: - the male-female divide, especially with the communities of color. There was a lot of talk early on in the preelection polls about Latino and African American men gravitating more toward Trump. We don't know yet the turnout levels in these communities, but it does appear that there was a major shift among African American men. According to the exit polls, about 20% of them went for Trump, whereas among African American women it was over 90 - I think 93% for Harris. And among Latinos, it was even more stark. According to these exit polls, a majority of Latino men voted for Trump, whereas two-thirds of Latina women voted for Harris. So there was major, major gender gap in the Black and Latino communities. I'm wondering your thoughts about that.\n\nKEEANGA - YAMAHTTA TAYLOR : I think that in terms of the extent of crisis that we see in this country, that can be measured by employment rates, that can be measured by poverty rates, that can be measured by a sense of the quality of one's life, all of the barometers that we use to measure the mood of the country have really been in decline. And I think for men, for Black men, in particular, they have felt - they have felt the brunt of that. And I think that it has been largely dismissed. I think, you know, President - former President Barack Obama got lots of attention when he came out weeks ago and essentially dismissed those concerns as just sexism. And so, I think - you know, I'm sure that that is part of the mix, but to reduce all of the economic anxiety of Black men and Black communities to sexism is, again, really to fail to capture. It's a failure to capture what is actually happening on the ground, that is measured not just by the historic low unemployment that Biden and Harris have talked about or by the historic low rates of poverty. But there is historically high sense of insecurity and a sense of not knowing what is actually going to come next. And I think that the Harris candidacy, that the Biden candidacy that preceded it, have really ignored the extent to which there has been continuity, whether we go back from the Obama administrations to the Trump administration to Biden's administration, a continuity in insecurity, a continuity in uncertainty, a continuity in just not knowing what the future is going to hold, so much so that it builds a sense of cynicism that it doesn't matter what you do. It doesn't matter how you vote.\n\nAnd then, in another sense, I think that Trump satisfies something different, because, to be honest, you know, the Republicans don't have any answers for that, either. And Trump's policy proposals guarantee to make the situation worse for Black men, for Latino men. But what it does offer is an opportunity to give the finger, to thumb your nose at the status quo, at the condescension of someone like Obama, who just a week ago I saw an ad that popped up on Instagram, and he's talking to a twenty-something young Latino man and saying to this young voter, who's trying to decide who he should vote for, that \"I know it looks like nothing has changed in your community, but you have to consider some woman was able to get her prescription. Someone else was able to get a bag of groceries.\" And it's like, what are we talking about? A prescription or a bag of groceries is not actually going to get it done. And so, the low expectations that they offer of what we should hold - what we should have for elected officials is part of the problem, because the attacks on people, on people's incomes, the rising rate of rent, all of those things [inaudible] ability to respond to that in a substantive way is part of what is driving this. And so, the lower expectations doesn't actually instill confidence that Democrats can get - can make a difference in people's lives. And so, that, I think, is the larger context to understand the small but significant defection to Trump.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You know, there's an interesting -\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: I'd like to bring John Nichols into the conversation. John, I wanted to ask you particularly - during the campaign, President Trump focused a lot of attention on immigration and on his threats to begin the biggest, the most massive deportation of undocumented in the country's history. Your sense of the results and what this will mean for the immigrant community and progressives, overall, in the coming weeks and months?\n\nJOHN NICHOLS : Look, this is a devastating result. And I think people have to recognize it. Donald Trump won by, it looks like, a reasonably comfortable margin in the Electoral College, when all is done, although there's still votes out, and I think we have to be a little careful about overassessing it. It is possible he'll win the popular vote, although I still think there are a lot of West Coast votes out that will definitely make it closer. And it could even still tip it slightly against him.\n\nBut what we've ended up with now is a situation where Donald Trump, as a president who has very few guardrails, has the potential to do - to take horrific actions, which, remember, in his first administration, he tried to do, as regards immigrants, refugees, working-class people, people who are in difficult situations across the board. And so, what we have to look at - and I think there's two things that are really important here. First, there's going to have to be a resistance to this. There's no question of that. But that resistance has to have at least some, hopefully some, traction on Capitol Hill. And that's where the results of the House and Senate races, that are still very much in play, become central to what we're talking about.\n\nThe Senate is going to be Republican. It will have at least a 52-48 Republican majority, and that majority could well grow. There are still six seats that are undeclared. I think about four of them will go to the Democrats, maybe less. But I think there's a good possibility two of them will go to the Republicans. If the Senate is that wide a Republican majority, Trump is going to get easy approval for a lot of what he's doing. There may be some places where, as we talk about something like the immigration issue, there could be pushback. But to do that pushback, you would have to build a coalition, whatever Democrats are there, and to find at least some Republicans who wouldn't vote for a Trump Cabinet pick or for a Trump initiative on, again, immigration, working-class issues in general, all sorts of things. The only way that's going to happen is if there is tremendous organizing on the ground, beginning now, today, in states where you have Republicans who have in the past broken with Trump at least on some education and related issues, people like Lisa Murkowski in Alaska, Susan Collins up in Maine.\n\nBut the real opposition, ultimately, is going to have to come in the House of Representatives. We don't know what's going to happen in the House. It is still very much up for grabs. There are 54 seats that are uncalled, much more than 10% of the House. If a majority of those seats, a good majority of those seats, goes to the Democrats, they've got the potential to be in a majority in the House of Representatives. It wouldn't be big, but they do have that potential. And this is not, you know, a foolish prospect to entertain, because most of the undeclared seats are on the West Coast, in California, Washington, Oregon. A lot of them will go Democratic. So we don't know where this is going to sort out, but this is the critical thing, Juan.\n\nIf you get to a Democratic majority in the House of Representatives, then you have the next test, which is whether they feel beaten down and weakened, and they just don't really want to fight, and they're saying, \"Oh, we'll find ways to work with this new administration,\" blah, blah, blah, things that they often say. Trump is going to take full advantage of that. And on the other hand, if they unite as a small but politically very powerful Democratic majority, that's where you can stop a lot of Trump initiatives. Again, as regards the House of Representatives, you've got to have vital organizing on the ground beginning now, so that if Democrats take control, they know that there are going to be people pressing them to do the right thing, to effectively be the opposition.\n\nAnd one final thing I'll say is, and Jamie Raskin and others have talked about this, Donald Trump has talked during this campaign about using the presidency in incredibly aggressive ways, not working with Congress but just going on his own with executive orders and all sorts of other initiatives. This is something that has to be challenged in the courts and, to the extent possible, in Congress. I know people are deeply disappointed in the U.S. Supreme Court. I certainly am. But it is absolutely vital that there be court challenges wherever possible, because there are places in the states and at the federal level where you might be able to push back on some of what's going on. Bottom line, at this point, Republicans have a lot of power. Donald Trump has a lot of power. The only way to counter that is going to be organizing that is highly focused, that demands that those Democrats who are still in positions of some authority resist Donald Trump in a realistic and effective way. That's possible, but that is, as we know from history, not certain.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Interestingly, it's been raised that President Trump could nominate Aileen Cannon, the judge who dismissed the case against him, to the Supreme Court. And if the Senate, as it is, goes Republican, he might succeed in making her a Supreme Court justice. But I wanted to ask you, John, when you talk about people organizing right now, about a point that was raised during the Obama years. In the last months of the Obama presidency, there was a call for him to pardon undocumented migrants before Trump was sworn in. Trump is now promising mass deportations. The question is: Could Biden preemptively pardon them? And what I mean by \"pardon,\" NYU Law Review , in the waning days of the Obama administration, with Trump's crackdown promised, over a hundred advocacy organizations joined forces to urge President Obama to permanently protect hundreds of thousands of immigrants from deportation by pardoning their breaches of civilian immigration law. John Nichols?\n\nJOHN NICHOLS : Sure. Look, I am going to defer to the NYU Law Review and to legal experts who have worked on these issues for years and know much more than I do about the specifics of how you would mount such an initiative.\n\nBut what I can tell you is this, and this is the critical thing, I think, for progressives across this country to understand. The presidency is for four years. It is not for three years and 10 months or something like that. The last months of a presidency have to be used in smart and effective ways. And you have to look at all the powers of the presidency. What that means is that Joe Biden has several months left in which to do what is right morally and politically. And there has to be, again, I think, pressure there. We were just talking about, you know, organizing on the ground as regards to the Senate to put pressure on Republicans who might work with Democrats, organizing on the ground as regards to the House to put Democrats to actually be Democrats, what Paul Wellstone used to refer to as the Democratic wing of the Democratic Party. But then, finally, there must be pressure on the ground and even toward Washington on Joe Biden, to make sure that he uses the last months of his presidency in a clear and effective, moral and politically smart way.\n\nAnd so, what I would suggest to you is, folks who are deeply frustrated or overwhelmed by these results have a right to be so, and I won't deny that. But I think that one important thing is to recognize that time matters in these struggles. And so, if you are going to lobby members of the Senate, members of the House and the president himself, you need to do that now, not wait months until January 20th or something like that. And again, what I would emphasize is, there's a lot of organized groups across this country that are concerned about these issues. They have relationships with sitting members of Congress, with Republicans and Democrats. And they need to - you know, they need to open those conversations, to have those town hall meetings, to have those protests, to have those marches, to speak truth to power in a way that might yet be heard and might yet have an impact.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And I'd like to bring Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor back into the conversation. Keeanga, your sense of what the potential steps now are for the progressive and resistance movement to this incoming administration?\n\nKEEANGA - YAMAHTTA TAYLOR : Yeah, I think that we have a real problem. I mean, I appreciate the sentiment that John is expressing about the need to be mobilized and to resist now. But, you know, activism and social movements don't often work like that. They're not water faucets, where you just turn them off, and then, when you need them, you turn them back on. I think that the movement, movements that we have understood them to be over the previous decade, with something like the Black Lives Matter social movement, at its center, have been damaged and have been demobilized. I think in the last election, in 2020, that there was so much focus on getting Biden elected and then winning those Georgia Senate races a few months later, that the whole focus of external pressure on elected officials was dissipated, and to such an extent that Biden faced no protest, really, until the end of the twilight of his term, last spring, when the Palestinian solidarity movement exploded, in a way, because it couldn't be coopted by the Democratic Party, in ways that these other social movements not necessarily coopted, but absorbed into the Democratic Party program, organizers convinced that they had access to the Biden administration, that they had the ear of the Biden administration. And so, I think that we actually have a lot of rebuilding to do. I don't think we're going to see the same initial response that we saw in 2017 with the Women's March and the immediate reaction to Donald Trump. There's a lot of rebuilding that has to be done.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We're talking to Princeton University professor Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor. She's professor of African American studies there. Keeanga, I am looking at a Semafor article from May 29th, its headline, \"'A dying empire led by bad people': Poll finds young voters despairing over US politics.\" And it starts off by saying, \"Young voters overwhelmingly believe that almost all politicians are corrupt and that the country will end up worse off than when they were born, according to new polling from Democratic firm Blueprint obtained exclusively by Semafor .\" And I think it's interesting that you raised the protests around Palestine. In a minute, we're going to speak with the Palestinian American journalist Rami Khouri. But the protests in the spring that, you know, the encampments across the country, and this feeling that young people have, if you could comment on it, \"a dying empire led by bad people\"?\n\nKEEANGA - YAMAHTTA TAYLOR : Look, there was a lot of focus on what would happen with Black voters, what would happen on other voters. Harris got wiped out on 18-to-29-year-olds relative to Biden in 2020. I think she was down 22 to 24 points among the youngest voters. These are people who really have this sense of what does the future behold, right? These are young people whose entire lives have been shaped by American wars, American empire, American occupation. Many of them are saddled with debt that they cannot repay, debt that there are no jobs available to them that would allow them to repay it. They are faced with exponentially rising rents, rents - laissez-faire housing market. And so, it's a very dark, dystopic horizon for young people in this country.\n\nAnd some of the things that provided a sense of hope, you think about the 2020 protests that brought tens of millions of especially young people into the streets, that gave them a sense of vitality, that gave them a sense that they could actually influence the direction of politics and the direction of this country through their own self-activity and organization, and the way that those protests were siphoned into the presidential campaigns of 2020 and the way that people were actively demobilized and told that the access to the Biden administration could produce the goods that they wanted. And even as that was falling apart, even as the Biden administration was unable to follow through on the promises it made, no response, no leadership, no direction. And so, that is something that is going to have to change, and that it's going to have to come from those people, those young people, whose future looks very dark in the hands of others, but that they have the capacity to get organized, they have the capacity to be mobilized, and they have the capacity to change the direction of this country.\n\nAnd so, this is a very grim, dark day. And I said before that I'm not - I am shocked that this happened, but I'm not surprised. We could see the trajectory of this happening for the last three months. But this does not have to be the final chapter. But in changing the - turning the page and changing the story, we have to rethink lots of what we are doing in terms of our relationship as progressives, as part of the left, our relationship to the Democratic Party, our inability to act independently, to be completely tied to the electoral ups and downs, the electoral cycle of the Democratic Party, when we look at the actual policies and practices that they're pursuing.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Yeah, I wanted to bring John Nichols back into the conversation. John, the climate crisis, we have been faced - the entire world has been faced in recent years with constant hurricanes, floods, forest fires. And now we're facing a Trump presidency where he is still using in his campaigns the slogan \"Drill, baby, drill.\" Your sense of what the climate - the movement to stem the climate crisis now faces in the United States?\n\nJOHN NICHOLS : Well, as my colleague says, this is a dystopian result. And where Donald Trump is coming from on these issues is not one of even a traditional Republican kind of tip and nod of the head to concerns about the climate, but then a decision to go where the fossil fuel companies tell you to go; this is a situation where Donald Trump has aggressively said and will make central to his agenda an effort to let fossil fuel companies do as they choose, to let the financiers who back them do as they choose. I mean, it really is devastating in this regard.\n\nAnd if I can just build on this, one thing relating to what was just said about Gaza, it is very important to note that people in Congress who stood up on Gaza, who spoke out on it, and who made it through primaries where AIPAC tried to defeat them, did very, very well yesterday. Bernie Sanders won by two to one up in Vermont. Ilhan Omar won with more than 70%. Rashida Tlaib, who did not endorse Kamala Harris, won with more than 70%. Greg Casar in Texas won with almost 70%. Summer Lee, who's in a much more competitive district than some of these other folks, she won with a percentage, you know, in the high 50s. And so, the bottom line is that taking a strong stand on Gaza in this general election, that didn't hurt people. In fact, I think it may well have helped some candidates.\n\nAnd the same thing is true with climate. It's notable that everyone I just mentioned there who's been outspoken on the issue of Gaza, and some other folks, too, who have been outspoken on Gaza, like AOC , have made climate very central to their service in Congress. And other people who did well also. The problem here is with the leadership of the Democratic Party, because in this election, not only did they refuse to talk in any kind of consistent or effective way on the issue of Gaza, they also refused to talk in any consistent, effective way on climate. And, you know, they would say occasional good things, but it wasn't as central as it needed to be.\n\nAnd then, if we pause here and ask ourselves, \"OK, well, when we look at polling, when we look at anecdotal evidence, what are the issues that young people care about?\" Well, we hear about climate. We hear about Gaza. Certainly, we hear about racial justice. When you see that decline in support from young people, I think it's not that hard to explain. I think an awful lot of young people in this country simply did not hear what they needed to hear from the Democratic Party. And if they continue to have that silence or that lack of outreach on those issues, then I think you're in a situation where the Democratic Party is going to continue to struggle with what has been one of its most vital constituencies in recent years, and that's young voters.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This update, just as the House is up for grabs, Republican Mike Lawler of New York - and it looks like New York and California will determine the balance of the Senate [ sic ].

      "text": "You turn to us for voices you won't hear anywhere else.\n\nSign up for Democracy Now!'s Daily Digest to get our latest headlines and stories delivered to your inbox every day.\n\nAfter Biden's major foreign policy address Monday at the State Department, we go to Jerusalem and get an analysis of Biden's foreign policy decisions in Israel and Palestine from Matt Duss, executive vice president at the Center for International Policy and former foreign policy adviser to Senator Bernie Sanders. \"There's simply no question at this point that the laws of war have been egregiously violated,\" he says of the Israeli military's genocidal conduct against Palestinians in Gaza. \"When it comes to America's friends and allies, he has a different standard.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org. I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nAs Gaza ceasefire talks continue and less than a week before President Donald Trump takes office, outgoing President Joe Biden defended his foreign policy in a major address at the State Department yesterday, where he was met by protesters with signs that read \"Biden's policy is genocide.\"\n\nPROTESTER : Shame! Shame on you, you war criminal! Shame!\n\nAMY GOODMAN : In his speech on Monday, Biden said his administration spearheaded a ceasefire plan that the U.N. Security Council approved in June, even as he continued to provide Israel with weapons and claimed to be, quote, \"on the brink of a proposal I laid out months ago,\" he said.\n\nPRESIDENT JOE BIDEN : We're pressing hard to close this. The deal we have structured would free the hostages, halt the fighting, provide security to Israel, and allow us to significantly surge humanitarian assistance to the Palestinians, who have suffered terribly in this war that Hamas started. They've been through hell. So many innocent people have been killed. So many communities have been destroyed. The Palestinian people deserve peace and the right to determine their own futures. Israel deserves peace and real security. And the hostages and their families deserve to be reunited. And so we're working urgently to close this deal.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Biden also touted his administration's role gaining NATO support for Ukraine after Russia's 2022 invasion and defended the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 after two decades of occupation.\n\nFor more, we go to Jerusalem. We're joined by Matt Duss, executive vice president at the Center for International Policy, former foreign policy adviser to Senator Bernie Sanders. His new piece for The Guardian , \"Democrats have become the party of war. Americans are tired of it.\"\n\nMatt, welcome back to Democracy Now! Respond to President Biden's address.\n\nMATT DUSS : Well, I think, looking at it as a whole, I mean, I think there are things that President Biden can claim credit for in his foreign policy. The break from the neoliberal economic order, a new approach to economics that invests in jobs and American manufacturing, that has important domestic and foreign policy implications. I think his work defending Brazilian democracy is something that's not mentioned enough. He very likely helped avert a coup against Lula in Brazil. And I do think he can claim some credit for rallying allies for the defense of Ukraine against Russia's invasion.\n\nOn the other hand - and I do think this is what his foreign policy will be remembered for - is Gaza. There's just no other way to look at it. I think being here in Israel and Palestine and Jerusalem - I've traveled in the West Bank - talking to Israelis and Palestinians, there is a lot of anger, of course, at Hamas and at Benjamin Netanyahu, but there's also a great bit of anger at Joe Biden himself for not applying enough pressure on Netanyahu to get this deal, which, let's remember, Joe Biden announced this proposed deal back in May. Months have passed. Tens of thousands of people, more people have been killed. More lives have been destroyed. More Israeli hostages have been killed. So, I think there's a great deal of anger for him here, and I think that's going to impact American foreign policy and in this region, around the world, too.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Matt, you are in Jerusalem. You're usually in Washington, D.C. Why are you there?\n\nMATT DUSS : I'm here with some colleagues just, as I said, speaking with Israelis, with Palestinians, members of the governments, analysts, journalists, activists and regular citizens, just to try and get a sense of what people are thinking and feeling here, as we see the handover between - you know, from Biden to Trump, what are people's fears, what are their hopes, just to kind of share those perspectives with colleagues back at home and to better inform the conversation.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And where have you gone?\n\nMATT DUSS : We've been in Ramallah. We've been in Jerusalem. We'll be in the West Bank later today. Earlier this morning, my colleagues and I visited one of the communities near Gaza that was attacked on October 7, were able to see some of the sites of these attacks, talk to members of this community. It is hard to talk about. I mean, what happened on that day, I think everyone understands, was unspeakable. That pain is still very, very real in these communities and in Israel, as well as the pain of what is happening in Gaza amongst Palestinians.\n\nThere's great anticipation for the end of this war, great anticipation for the release of Palestinian prisoners that would be part of this hostage release and ceasefire deal. But I do want to relate something I heard from a member of one of the kibbutzes that were attacked on October 7. He understands that this war is doing no good. He wants the ceasefire. He wants the hostages released. He wants Palestinian civilians to stop being killed. And I think that is a message that President Biden has not heard loud enough, very tragically.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Matt Duss, you write in your piece , \"Biden showed that international law is little more than a cudgel to be used against our enemies while being treated as optional for our friends.\" Explain.\n\nMATT DUSS : Yeah, yeah. I mean, I think if you look at the Ukraine, you know, Biden's approach to Ukraine, and compare that to his approach to the Gaza war, the contrast could not be starker. I think in helping rally to the defense of Ukraine, President Biden and his administration articulated a very strong set of principles of international law, the right of countries to be sovereign and defend their own borders, you know, to defend themselves against invasion. At the same time, we see Israel, even though Israel, of course, had the right to respond to October 7 and prevent such an attack from happening again, the tactics it's been using in Gaza have violated almost every protection of civilians. It has violated many of the same rules of war that Russia has been violating in Ukraine and for which Russia has been rightly condemned. And yet we hear, you know, month after month after month, over a year now, nothing like that condemnation - in fact, no condemnation whatsoever from President Biden, in fact, continuing not only not to condemn them, but continuing to send a massive flow of arms that is facilitating this mass slaughter in Gaza. And I think many Americans understand that, and I can guarantee people around the world understand that, many who have questions about what is this so-called international order that President Biden is talking about, when we see the stark disparity between Ukraine and Gaza.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I wanted to go to a headline just last week, the Biden administration announcing new sanctions against Sudan's Rapid Support Forces after concluding the paramilitary group committed genocide. And it goes on to say -\n\nMATT DUSS : Right.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : - that Secretary of State Tony Blinken said he had made the determination \"after reviewing the horrifying information of suffering inside Sudan.\" More than half the population faces crisis-level hunger. The New York Times reports Biden administration had been reluctant to admit that the Rapid Support Forces were committing genocide in Sudan, for fear it would highlight Biden's refusal to make the same determination about Israel's killing of Palestinians in Gaza. Matt?\n\nMATT DUSS : I think that fear is well founded. While I am glad to see that determination, and our organization welcomed it - I think a lot of people were happy to see that, the administration calling this for what it is - he should be willing to call out these same crimes being carried out against the people of Gaza, even if he's unwilling to use the word \"genocide.\" There are any number of other words and terms that he can use: crimes against humanity, atrocities, war crimes, violations of international law. He has been unwilling to do the most basic of those.\n\nAnd there's simply no question at this point that the laws of war have been egregiously violated. They are being violated right now as I stand here. When I was in southern Israel, we could look just two kilometers away and see the smoke rising from Gaza as we were there. This war is ongoing, and yet President Biden seems very - you know, he's quite willing to use these terms of condemnation when these crimes are being carried out by America's adversaries, but, as I wrote, when it comes to America's friends and allies, he has a different standard. And I think that is corrosive to the very idea of international law.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And then you have the House of Representatives in the U.S. voting last week to sanction the International Criminal Court in protest at its arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and the former Defense Secretary Gallant. This was Democrats joining with Republicans in this vote.\n\nMATT DUSS : Yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Matt, you talk about Democrats now -\n\nMATT DUSS : Yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : - becoming the party of war.\n\nMATT DUSS : Yeah, right. I mean, I was talking, I think, about - in that piece , I was referring to the way that Vice President Harris campaigned - not just about Vice President Harris, because, obviously, she was holding up the Biden administration's record and essentially had to run on that, so she carried the weight of, you know, a number of policies, including Gaza. But even if you look at the way she campaigned, starting at the convention and then on, highlighting national security bona fides , guaranteeing that she would oversee the most, quote, \"lethal military in the world,\" she really seemed to be leaning in to a kind of militarist status quo, leaving that space open for Donald Trump essentially to run as an antiwar candidate. This is something no one should believe. Donald Trump is certainly not an antiwar candidate, if you look at his record, if you look at the actual things he did when he was president. And yet, the fact that that space was left open for him, I think, is a criticism of the Democrats that I was trying to make, but it also shows that this is something that American voters are really thirsty for, someone to give them a different vision of an America that is not constantly at war. And that is something that Democrats really need to start figuring out how to do.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Matt Duss, I want to thank you for being with us, executive vice president at the Center for International Policy, former foreign policy adviser to Senator Bernie Sanders. We'll link to your new essay in The Guardian headlined \"Democrats have become the party of war. Americans are tired of it.\" Thanks for joining us from Jerusalem.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Despite attempts by left-wing segments of the Democratic base to shift the party's messaging toward populist, anti-corporate and progressive policies, says Nader, Democrats \"didn't listen.\" Under Trump, continues Nader, \"We're in for huge turmoil.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, \"War, Peace and the Presidency.\" I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.\n\nAs we continue to look at Donald Trump's victory over Kamala Harris and the Republicans taking control of the Senate - we don't know yet about the House - we're joined by Ralph Nader, the longtime consumer advocate, corporate critic, former, well, four-time presidential candidate, author of many books, including, most recently, Let's Start the Revolution: Tools for Displacing the Corporate State and Building a Country That Works for the People . Ralph Nader is the founder of the monthly newspaper the Capitol Hill Citizen .\n\nRalph, thanks so much for joining us. Your response to Donald Trump's victory? It looks like he not only won the Electoral College but will win the popular vote this time, as he didn't in the two past elections.\n\nRALPH NADER : Well, Amy and Juan, there's going to be a lot to digest here. This is a collapse of the Democratic Party. They didn't get their vote out that they wanted. They were several million votes below what they expected, and, of course, that made the difference in an Electoral College system in the swing states.\n\nBut the problem is much more serious than that. Basically, we now are a country under a dictatorial corporate state. Trump is basically a magnet and a trap for the Democrats. They spent tens of millions of dollars on ads going after Trump, instead of going after the four years that Trump deep-sixed so many critical issues and positions in his term as president. So, the problem is, it's so many variables here to deal with.\n\nIt all started, Amy, when the Democrats abandoned half the country to the red states. That's devastating. Then they started getting corporate cash in 1979, dialing for the same commercial values. That blurred their difference from the New Deal-type Democrats to the corporate Democrats. Then they contracted out the election to these corporate-conflicted profiteering consulting firms, which the mass media never seemed to want to investigate in this campaign. And then they abandoned public media. Basically, they abandoned radio to the Rush Limbaughs and created the Reagan Democrats. And then they never learn from their mistakes. They didn't learn from the mistakes of Hillary Clinton in 2016. Then, they never fire anybody after they lose, in one state after another, to horrendous, the worst Republican Party in history.\n\nAnd so, what is the message that they gave to the American people? The message is Trump is terrible, and you can't believe how bad the Republican Party is. It's too general a message, too simple. A vast majority of people think corporations have too much control over their lives. They didn't fill the blanks, denial of healthcare benefits. And they didn't fill the blanks on a living wage. They didn't fill the blanks on cracking down on corporate crooks. They didn't fill the blanks on reversing a tax system which undertaxes the very wealthy and the big corporations. They didn't reverse themselves really on trade. They didn't know how to rebut Trump on immigration. He called the people coming in rapists, criminals, drug traffickers, etc. Instead of saying, \"Well, they're fleeing oppressive countries that are backed by the U.S., dictators and oligarchs in Central and South America,\" they didn't say that millions of Americans trust immigrants to harvest their food, to care for their children, to care for elderly, to provide critical services that nobody wants to work in in the U.S.\n\nSo, you know, there's such a bill of particulars against this Democratic Party. And what's happened, of course, is that millions of people are basically saying, \"We're sick of throwaway lines. We're sick of not having the government return the benefits of massive taxation to us. We're sick of - all we hear about is empire abroad. All we hear about is more military budgets by the Democrats and the Republicans in Congress, giving the generals more than they ask for, eating the public budgets that should be providing public services and public infrastructure in communities all over the country, creating key jobs.\"\n\nNow, we tried to straighten out these Democrats. Twenty-four civic leaders in 2022, going into the present time, tried to tell them how to communicate, what to communicate with all the people. And they didn't listen. The Democratic Party severed any kind of response - that's Nancy Pelosi, that's Chuck Schumer, you name them - with the civic community in Washington, D.C., the ones that -\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Ralph? Ralph, let me ask you. For the progressive movement now, as it faces the return of Donald Trump, what do you think are the next steps in terms of resistance or reorganization that have to occur?\n\nRALPH NADER : Well, it's got to be focused on Congress. The House is not yet resolved, but only Congress can stop the Trumpsters. It isn't just Trump. Trump is a figurehead. Trump is a bullhorn. It's the Trumpsters. It's the Heritage Foundation. It's 2025. It's the takeover of departments that are dedicated to standing up for the people, the environmental protection bureau, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the auto safety bureau, the Federal Trade Commission, the Justice Department. These are all going to be turned into virulent, vengeful or inactive governments. They want to destroy the civil service, bring it back to the spoils system. We're in for huge turmoil. One can say that the election yesterday really elected President Vance. Trump is not going to last. He's going to disintegrate. And Vance is in a position to become the next president.\n\nSo, what has to be done, Juan, is massive focus on Congress, which is the main constitutionally authorized lever to hold the executive branch accountable, build for 2026. The Democrats will have far fewer people up for the Senate than the Republicans, unlike this year.\n\nAnd they've got to stop blasting away at people who want to challenge the Democratic Party. The party says to everybody on their side, \"You know how bad the Republicans are? You got nowhere to go.\" They spent a lot of money attacking the Green Party, the tiny Green Party, instead of listening to William Barber, Reverend William Barber, who said, \"Look, there's 80 million people who aren't going to vote. A lot of them are low-wage workers. If you get 15% of low-wage workers who aren't voting to go to the polls, the Democrats would have won.\" They didn't listen to him. They didn't listen to all the citizen groups who know how to talk to people, not just liberal patients or liberal workers, but conservative workers, conservative patients. Remember, a vast majority of this country wants to tax the undertaxed wealthy and the corporations. They want to break up the big banks. And above all, in poll after poll, they say that corporations have too much control over their lives. Sherrod Brown pulled in his horns and lost. Bernie Sanders campaigned on corporate power, and he won in a landslide in Vermont. And Harris refused to campaign with Bernie Sanders, but she campaigned in several states with Liz Cheney of the criminal Cheney family and the invasion of Iraq that killed over a million Iraqis.\n\nSo the blunders were endless. And it was basically turning her back on the progressive and the genuine populist constituency in this country. And Bernie, of course, supported Harris, but his positions were rejected constantly. He said, \"Get the living wage up. Get universal healthcare up. Crack down on corporate crooks. Increase Social Security benefits that have been frozen for over 50 years. And get the taxation on the wealthy.\" She ignored all that. Just throwaway lines.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

      "text": "Democrats Say DOGE Will Lead To Social Security Benefit Cuts, Privatization\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nWASHINGTON - A key part of President Donald Trump's victories in 2016 and 2024 was his ability to move the Republican Party away from its longstanding belief the United States needs to cut spending on Social Security and Medicare. It was a promise he made again and again in both races.\n\nDemocrats have a new goal: To convince voters it was all a lie. The party's top member on the Senate committee overseeing Social Security warned this week that Trump secretly wants to end Social Security as we know it.\n\nSen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said the Wall Street executive Trump tapped to head the Social Security Administration, Frank Bisignano, made a business career out of taking over troubled businesses, firing the workers and selling off what's left.\n\n\"That résumé and approach ought to concern Americans if somebody is thinking about applying that pattern to Social Security,\" Wyden said. \"As I've been saying for weeks now, this approach is a prelude to privatizing Social Security and handing it over to private equity.\"\n\nThough Trump has insisted he doesn't want to touch Social Security, this year he and his billionaire adviser Elon Musk have falsely claimed millions of dead people receive Social Security benefits while ordering cutbacks at the Social Security Administration, including potentially disruptive phone service changes, in the name of fighting fraud. Their words and actions have prompted Democrats to say the ultimate goal is privatization.\n\n\"Why are Donald Trump and Elon Musk doing this? Because the goal of Trump and Musk is to destroy Social Security from within and make it so unworkable, so inefficient, that Donald Trump has a pretext to cut benefits and privatize the program,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Wednesday on the Senate floor.\n\nPrivatizing Social Security, such as by giving recipients the option to invest their payroll contributions in the stock market, is an unpopular idea last championed by President George W. Bush in 2005, prompting an electoral backlash that led to one of the best midterms in the history of the Democratic Party.\n\nDemocrats are clearly fond of the memory.\n\n\"We won the House,\" Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.) told HuffPost this week.\n\nAsked if he thought it was more important to highlight the remote threat of privatization rather than simply pointing out the Trump administration is laying off frontline staff and disallowing claimants from verifying their identities over the phone, Neal said, \"That's exactly right.\"\n\n\"I think that what they say with fraud is, 'Well, here's the plan: If we keep suggesting that there's a lot of fraud, then, if we cut contact with the Social Security Administration, then we can prove that it doesn't work,\" Neal said.\n\nDemocratic polling has found voters are extremely worried about Musk's involvement with Social Security in particular, as the billionaire has referred to the program as a \"Ponzi scheme\" ― that is, a full-blown scam ― and suggested cuts are warranted.\n\nWhen Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) asked Bisignano if he favored privatizing the retirement program, Bisignano said he did not.\n\n\"I've never thought about privatizing,\" Bisignano said. \"It's not a word that anybody's ever talked to me about. And I don't see this institution as anything other than a government agency that gets run for the benefit of the American public.\"\n\nStill, the changes already underway at Social Security could have a significant impact on beneficiaries. At the urging of Musk's Department of Government Efficiency initiative, the agency has consolidated internal offices, fired staff and announced claimants will no longer be allowed to verify their identities over the phone, potentially requiring millions of additional visits to field offices each year. At the same time, DOGE has targeted field offices for closure.\n\nO n top of all that, DOGE affiliates improperly gained access to the agency's sensitive data, at least until they were told to butt out last week by a federal court.\n\nEven bureaucratic operations have taken on a seemingly political tone. The Social Security Administration's acting commissioner, Leland Dudek, canceled vital records contracts with the state of Maine after the governor feuded with President Trump over allowing transgender athletes in girls' sports. And Dudek threatened to shut down the agency altogether in response to the court order last week, relenting only when the judge sent a letter telling him not to do it.\n\nWyden said the administration's moves are a prelude to privatization, at least for the administration of the program if not for actually diverting payroll taxes into 401(k)-style accounts that invest in the stock market.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

And people go, 'Oh my goodness, we have all these problems now.

      "text": "Tyranny Expert Identifies Democrats' Big Weakness In Opposing Trump\n\nReporter, HuffPost\n\nYale history professor and authoritarianism expert Timothy Snyder on Tuesday highlighted what he believes is a key weakness in Democratic opposition to President Donald Trump - but also pointed to signs of hope.\n\nSpeaking with MSNBC 's Rachel Maddow , Snyder noted there are \"too few Democrats who are articulate in describing the world as it actually is unfolding before our eyes.\"\n\nThere \"are a few who are doing an excellent job,\" he admitted, though he did not name specific figures.\n\nHowever, Snyder then emphasized the strength of \"creative local\" grassroots opposition across the country. \"Probably more than we see, because, unfortunately, we don't have enough local reporters to cover it properly,\" he said.\n\nSnyder predicted that in coming months the two forces - grassroots activism and emboldened political figures - slowly will converge \"as these creative protests create platforms for the more adventurous and charismatic politicians.\"\n\nMaddow asked about the impact of such opposition.\n\nSnyder stressed its importance in preventing the normalization of undemocratic actions.\n\n\"When strange things happen and nobody reacts, then everybody normalizes,\" he said. \"But if strange things happen and a few people react, or even more than a few people react, then people can say, 'Yeah, maybe I wouldn't protest myself, but this sure is a strange thing that's happening.' And then when another strange thing happens, they might actually protest.\"\n\n\"So getting out there, showing your face, being with other people, being creative, making up slogans and signs, all of that is really important because it arrests people's imagination,\" he added. \"It helps them stop and think and say, 'Wait, this is in fact strange because other people think it's strange.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) on Thursday said the country needs a Democratic Party that is prepared to fight to stop President Donald Trump from enacting his sweeping agenda.\n\nAt an event with Sen.

      "text": "Divided Democrats Give Away Their Leverage As Trump Gloats\n\nSenior Politics Reporter, HuffPost\n\nWASHINGTON ― In capitulating to Republicans on their partisan bill funding the government, Democrats may have put their party in an even worse position during the next round of negotiations on spending that is expected later this year.\n\nWith the GOP controlling both chambers of Congress and the White House, Democrats have precious little leverage to push back against President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk's efforts to demolish federal agencies and shut off spending on government programs without congressional approval.\n\nTheir biggest tool is denying Republicans the 60 votes necessary to advance legislation in the Senate, or mounting a filibuster ― something they've long complained about in the past when they were in the majority. For a brief moment on Wednesday, it looked like Democrats were going to use it on the GOP funding bill, heartening Democratic voters who demanded they do more to stop Trump.\n\nBut just a day later, after a heated closed-door debate within his caucus, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) announced he would not filibuster the bill, issuing a key signal that ultimately led nine more of his Democratic colleagues to follow suit and clear the way for its passage on Friday.\n\nIt was a stunning reversal that prompted outcry from other Democrats across the ideological spectrum, including two of Schumer's allies, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).\n\n\"I'll take the bullets,\" Schumer told The New York Times, insisting that a government shutdown would give Trump even more power to close federal programs and lay off workers.\n\nOther Democrats, however, said that passing the GOP spending bill would empower Trump to withhold funding to states and localities that don't do his bidding, including those of Republicans who may stand in his way. They also said that by choosing not to filibuster now, Democrats were weakening their hand and setting themselves up for another embarrassing loss to Republicans when funding expires in September.\n\n\"We become irrelevant if we don't use our power on cloture to demand that we have a seat at the table. We obviously have to make sure we aren't cut out of negotiations in the future,\" Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said Friday.\n\nAsked what leverage Democrats had over Trump in the future, Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.), said, \"I think we would have more if we stood up for ourselves today.\"\n\nSchumer, meanwhile, told reporters he thinks Democrats might be able to get a better deal since Trump will be less popular come September and that Republican appropriators might be more willing to stand up to him. Trump's approval numbers have dipped in recent weeks, especially due to his handling of the economy and turmoil in the stock market.\n\nIt's possible that Trump's approval rating nosedives even more in the next six months, but history has shown that congressional Republicans are far more likely to bend the knee than risk angering the president or his supporters.\n\nThere could be opportunities for Congress to return to passing bipartisan spending bills via regular order, unlike the one that passed on Friday. Lawmakers must tackle several issues in the coming months that could require bipartisan support, including raising the debt ceiling and delivering aid to victims of the California wildfires. They will also have to act to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies that are due to expire at the end of the year.\n\n\"I hope we can work on something that it is bipartisan. I think we can,\" Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) said Friday. \"There are things you got, the ACA, expiring subsidies and other things out there that maybe we can get a bipartisan outcome.\"\n\nDemocrats have had more success in pushing back against Trump and Musk's efforts in the courts. The president has suffered several legal setbacks, including judges striking down his executive order eliminating birthright citizenship as well as reinstating many federal workers who were laid off in recent weeks.\n\nRepublicans have also suffered in the court of public opinion. GOP lawmakers have faced angry town halls with many voters posing scathing questions about policies rolled out under Trump's administration, including tariffs on Canada and Mexico and cuts to popular agencies like the Social Security Administration, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nTurmp, meanwhile, gloated as Democrats bickered over their situation on Friday, praising Schumer for making a \"really good and smart move\" by not blocking the bill funding the government.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Senate Democrats In A Jam On Government Funding\n\nSenior Politics Reporter, HuffPost\n\nWASHINGTON - Senate Democrats are facing a difficult decision whether to hold their nose and vote for Republican legislation that would empower President Donald Trump's administration to continue slashing federal agencies or risk a costly government shutdown later this week.\n\nThe vexing question for the party comes amid pressure from their liberal base that is pushing for tougher resistance to Trump and one of his closest advisers, Elon Musk. The tech billionaire has spearheaded efforts to freeze spending and downsize the federal workforce despite lacking congressional approval, angering civil servants and creating chaos across the government.\n\nAt the same time, if enough Democratic senators do not support the House legislation, government funding will almost certainly lapse on Friday at midnight, disrupting government services and resulting in furloughs of federal employees. There's no telling how long such a shutdown would last since the House recessed on Tuesday and isn't expected to return until March 24, putting even more pressure on Democrats.\n\n\"We're choosing between awful and terrible,\" Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) acknowledged to reporters on Tuesday.\n\nThe six-month funding package, which narrowly passed in the House by 217-213 on Tuesday, largely continues spending at current levels. It would boost defense spending by $6 billion and cut nondefense spending by $13 billion.\n\nMore importantly, Democrats noted, it would allow Trump and Musk to spend or shut off funding for programs as they see fit because it lacks critical language that is contained in regular full-year negotiated bills that would make it easier for their party to put a check on the president in court.\n\n\"Instead of working with Democrats to invest in working families and communities all across America, Speaker Johnson has rolled out a slush fund continuing resolution that would give Donald Trump and Elon Musk more power over federal spending - and more power to pick winners and losers, which threatens families in blue and red states alike,\" Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said in a statement.\n\nVice President JD Vance appeared to acknowledge the spending flexibility in the bill in a private meeting of House Republicans earlier on Tuesday morning, where he urged them to support it because Trump will \"ensure allocations from Congress are not spent on things that harm the taxpayer,\" according to NOTUS .\n\nDemocratic senators on Tuesday debated for nearly two hours at a tense closed-door lunch about their best course of action, but they emerged with no clear consensus on the path forward.\n\n\"We're going to wait and see what the House does,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told reporters afterward.\n\nSince Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) is expected to oppose the bill, Republicans will need at least eight Democratic senators to cross the aisle and support the measure to clear the 60-vote threshold needed to avoid a filibuster. They can count Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) as one of them.\n\n\"I'm not going to vote to shut the government down,\" Fetterman told reporters on Tuesday, warning that a government shutdown \"will impact and punish millions and millions of Americans.\"\n\n\"If they want to do that, that's on them, but I'm not going to be a part of it,\" he added.\n\nAt least a handful of other Democratic senators appeared to be undecided.\n\n\"I'm going to wait to make a decision and assess what's best for Arizona,\" Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) said.\n\nGeorgia Sen. Jon Ossoff, who faces a potentially tough reelection next year, said a shutdown is \"not in our nation's interests\" but did not say how he'd vote on the Republican bill.\n\nAnd Sen. Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, said Republicans could make a government shutdown more painful than normal and \"use it to expand the president's power, even beyond what they're already considering.\"\n\n\"It's a very tough choice,\" he added.\n\nBut Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a member of Schumer's leadership team, urged Democrats to oppose the bill because it would give Trump more power to spend as he sees fit, rather than as Congress had appropriated.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

We could be in a shutdown for six months or nine months,\" Schumer told The New York Times earlier on Friday, arguing a shutdown would be far too unpredictable.\n\nInternal party critics have said Schumer gave up a rare moment of leverage far too easily, misplaying his hand after an often-fractious House Republican Caucus passed a party-line spending bill with Trump's blessing.\n\nSchumer suggested he was willing to face withering criticism from moderate House members to angry progressive activists: \"I'll take some of the bullets.\"\n\nThese nine senators are likely to share in Schumer's political suffering, though none of them are an obvious target for an immediate primary challenge.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Democrats Propose To Fight Health Care Fraud - And To Protect Obamacare Subsidies\n\nSenior National Correspondent, HuffPost\n\nA senior Democratic senator is leading an effort to pass legislation designed to cut down on a particular kind of health care fraud - and, in the process, to shore up the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOn Wednesday, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) introduced a bill to stop brokers who sell \"Obamacare\" insurance from engaging in a series of deceptive of fraudulent practices, like luring customers with misleading advertisements or enrolling people in plans without their full consent.\n\nWhen that happens, people can discover they are on the hook for higher out-of-pocket costs than they expected, or that they have more limited access to providers and drugs. In some cases, people end up owing back taxes because they unwittingly got financial assistance the federal government makes available based on income - and for which they were not eligible.\n\nThe legislation would impose new civil and criminal penalties for such broker behavior, require new auditing procedures and take other steps that go beyond anti-fraud measures the federal government has taken already.\n\nWyden's bill has nine co-sponsors , all of them Democrats. Reps. Kathy Castor (D-Fla.) and Deborah Ross (D-N.C.) have introduced a companion version in the House.\n\nBut the legislation isn't just an effort to address a well-documented policy problem. It's also an attempt to shape a coming political debate about the Affordable Care Act's future ― and, in particular, how much financial assistance should be available for people who buy insurance through it.\n\nSince 2021, people buying insurance through Obamacare have been eligible for extra subsidies , thanks to a temporary boost President Joe Biden and the Democrats enacted as part of their COVID relief efforts and then, one year later, extended.\n\nThat money runs out this year. At that point, the extra subsidies will go away - and insurance will become more expensive - unless President Donald Trump and Congress decide to extend the assistance in some form.\n\nNeither Trump nor the Republican lawmakers in charge of Congress have said much about the issue. But conservatives have argued against extension, citing not just the overall cost (somewhere between $30 billion and $40 billion a year in federal expenditures, based on Congressional Budget Office estimates ) but also what they say is widespread waste and fraud in the program.\n\nTheir solution is to let the provision of the enhanced subsidies lapse, as planned, on the theory that extra money gives brokers ― and individual consumers ― more incentive to exploit or defraud the system.\n\n\"The only way to meaningfully reduce waste and fraud is for Congress to permit the enhanced part of the subsidies to expire,\" Brian Blase , a former Trump administration official who is now president of the Paragon Institute, wrote in a newsletter last year.\n\nBut without those additional subsidies in place, premiums would be higher and several million more people would go without insurance altogether, according to CBO and other independent analysts .\n\nCiting that possibility, Wyden and his colleagues say the federal government should keep providing the enhanced subsidies ― perhaps through a bill Democrats introduced earlier this year ― while focusing anti-fraud efforts on the \"rogue brokers.\"\n\n\"The best way to fight fraud is to go after fraudsters,\" Wyden said in a prepared statement. \"Republicans have been talking a lot about waste, fraud, and abuse lately ― this legislation is a great place to start rather than taking away health insurance from working Americans and increasing premiums for millions of families.\"\n\n\"If President Trump and Congressional Republicans were serious about addressing fraud in our health systems, they would support this critical legislation,\" said Ross.\n\nIt's not clear when ― or if ― Republican leaders in Congress will take up this issue. But this week the Trump administration took some steps toward changing the Affordable Care Act on its own, through executive action: It proposed to reverse Biden-era rules that made Affordable Care Act enrollment easier, especially for lower-income Americans.\n\nIf the Trump proposal becomes final, the open enrollment period for Affordable Care Act insurance will be shorter, while people signing up for coverage will have to provide more information about their income status.\n\nThe Trump proposal would also undo a Biden decree making so-called \"Dreamers\" ― undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as young children ― eligible to buy subsidized coverage through the Affordable Care Act.\n\nA Trump administration press release described this proposed rollback of the Biden rules as \"critical and necessary ... to protect people from being enrolled in Marketplace coverage without their knowledge or consent, promote stable and affordable health insurance markets, and ensure taxpayer dollars fund financial assistance only for the people the ACA set out to support.\"\n\nAmong those who see it differently are Sabrina Corlette , a research professor at Georgetown University.\n\n\"Under this banner of trying to crack down on the bad actions of some insurance brokers, they are penalizing consumers, particularly low-income consumers, with more burdensome requirements and more limits on their access to coverage,\" Corlette told KFF Health News , which has done extensive reporting on Affordable Care Act enrollment fraud.\n\nGovernment estimates suggest that reverting to the old, pre-Biden rules could reduce federal spending significantly ― by between $10 billion and $14 billion a year, the Trump administration said in its press release.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Democrats Reintroduce Sweeping Bill To Strengthen Unions\n\nSenior Politics Reporter, HuffPost\n\nLabor Reporter, HuffPost\n\nWASHINGTON - Congressional Democrats on Wednesday reintroduced the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, or PRO Act, a sweeping bill aimed at boosting union membership after decades of decline.\n\nThe legislation , led this year by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.), would amount to the most significant overhaul to labor law in nearly 80 years, making it easier for workers to organize and bargain union contracts and more costly for employers to violate their rights.\n\n\"For too long, workers have suffered from anti-union attacks and toothless labor laws that have undermined their right to work safely and be paid fairly,\" Scott said at a press conference at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday.\n\n\"In the last few weeks, we have seen Elon Musk, the wealthiest man on earth, single-handedly terminate the jobs of hundreds of thousands of federal employees,\" Sanders added. \"If Musk and his friends can arbitrarily fire hundreds of thousands of federal employees, what to you think they'll do to the millions of workers who are impacted by technological revolution and artificial robotics?\"\n\n\"The only protection that workers will have from massive layoffs,\" the senator added, \"is through forming unions, standing up for their rights, and making sure the new technology benefits workers and not just the oligarchs.\"\n\nThe legislation was first introduced in Congress in 2019 with the support of a broad range of labor unions, progressive groups and worker advocates. But not every Democratic lawmaker was on board at the time, especially in the Senate, where a handful of members of the Democratic caucus had expressed concerns for businesses and independent contractors.\n\nNow, with conservative Democrat Joe Manchin and independent Kyrsten Sinema retired and out of the Senate, support within the Democratic Party for the legislation is expected to be unanimous, a mark of progress for the labor movement despite the fact that Republicans control both chambers of Congress and aren't likely to take it up.\n\nIn a sign of the shifting gravity within the party, Sen. Mark Kelly, an initial holdout on the bill, is cosponsoring it this year. The Arizona Democrat, who first embraced the bill last year amid speculation that he would be picked as former Vice President Kamala Harris' 2024 presidential running mate, said his support solidified after Donald Trump's election in November.\n\n\"He's making it abundantly clear that he is going to work on passing policies that help the wealthiest people, and these policies are often at the expense of working-class folks,\" Kelly told HuffPost in an interview at his Capitol Hill office on Wednesday.\n\nThe PRO Act encompasses a host of reforms that labor unions have sought for years. It would create financial penalties for employers who commit unfair labor practices; bar companies from holding anti-union \"captive-audience\" meetings; make it easier for newly formed unions to secure their first contracts; strengthen a worker's right to strike and boycott; and override anti-union \"right to work\" laws that suppress union membership.\n\nKelly and some other moderate Democrats have been hung up on a provision that would create a narrower definition of who qualifies as an \"independent contractor.\" The change would basically make it easier for workers who've been classified as contractors - such as truck drivers, gig workers and freelancers - to unionize and bargain.\n\n\"I don't want to see people lose their jobs,\" Kelly said Wednesday, adding that \"it would be good to have an amendment process and we could make the legislation better.\"\n\nThe legislation passed the Democratic-controlled House in 2020, but it has never come up for a vote in the Senate.\n\nGOP opposition has been broad but not unanimous - Trump's nominee for labor secretary, former Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer (Ore.), was one of three House Republicans to cosponsor the legislation in the last Congress.\n\nFacing pressure from Republicans during her confirmation hearing, Chavez-DeRemer renounced support for the bill's provision that would preempt state \"right to work\" laws. Although Republican Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.) voted against her nomination, several Democrats crossed the aisle and voted to advance Chavez-DeRemer out of committee due to her previous PRO Act support.\n\nBut Trump's pick for labor secretary shouldn't be taken as a sign he'll support strong union rights. Shortly after his inauguration, he took the unprecedented step of firing a Democratic member of the National Labor Relations Board, eliminating its quorum and rendering it inoperable. Tasked with enforcing collective-bargaining rights, the NLRB would gain new enforcement powers under the PRO Act.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

This strategy is doomed to fail.\n\nNational Security Advisor Michael Waltz, Vice President J.D. Vance, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, pictured in the Oval Office of the White House on March 13, 2025, were all in the Signal group chat that accidentally included Atlantic editor in chief Jeffrey Goldberg. (Andrew Harnik / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nOn Monday, Atlantic editor in chief Jeffrey Goldberg broke some bizarre news. He'd been accidentally included in a group chat on the messaging app Signal where Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Vice President J. D. Vance, and other high-level figures in the Trump administration were discussing their plans to bomb Yemen. This was extremely confidential information, and most of the reaction to it has revolved around the administration's failure of \"operational security.\"\n\nGoldberg himself is a neoconservative commentator who rarely meets a war he doesn't like. He doesn't seem to have the slightest objection to the content of the plans discussed in the group chat. But he was clearly disturbed by his own inclusion.\n\nDemocrats have lined up to accept this framing. Chuck Schumer and the leaders of several relevant Senate subcommittees, for example, sent a letter to Donald Trump expressing \"extreme alarm\" about \"the astonishingly poor judgment\" shown by accidentally including Goldberg in the chat. In other words, they're fine with bombing Yemen. They just want the government to do a better job of keeping it secret.\n\nThe truth is that this is the kind of story that liberals love, because it gives them a chance to preen about process and \"seriousness\" and display their patriotic zeal about \"national security.\" In the decade since Trump began his first run for the presidency, their consistent impulse has been to gravitate toward issues that allow them to hammer home that message. Hence the years-long obsession with \"Russian collusion\" that fizzled out into not much, the years of relitigating the January 6 riot at the Capitol, and Kamala Harris's bizarre strategy of touring the country with Liz Cheney to prove that \"Country First\" Republicans were on their side.\n\nThis strategy has flopped consistently, but that hasn't stopped Democrats who have stubbornly refused to focus on the actual harms Republicans are doing to the American working class (the appeal of which has been dramatized by the runaway success of Bernie Sanders's anti-oligarchy tour). And of course they won't slam Trump for being a warmonger, because they don't really disagree with his warmongering. Everyone in this story, from neocon Goldberg to the outraged Democrats to the allegedly \"America First\" Trumpists, takes it for granted that America has an unlimited right to project its imperial hegemony around the world.\n\nIn his initial article , Goldberg said the plans shared in the group chat \"included precise information about weapons packages, targets, and timing.\" He \"could not believe that the national-security leadership of the United States would communicate on Signal about imminent war plans,\" never mind that they would be so \"reckless\" as to accidentally include a journalist such as himself. And while quoting much of the rest of the conversation, he repeatedly omitted operational details that he worried could harm \"national security.\"\n\nHow exactly the \"security\" of anyone in the United States would be harmed by Yemenis knowing details of an attack against them they've been shown powerless to retaliate against is a fascinating question. A series of administration officials and media allies spent Monday and Tuesday denying that anything classified was discussed in the group chat, though, and so Goldberg came back on Wednesday with a second article quoting the parts about operational details. If the administration said it wasn't classified after all, so be it. And the second article made it clear the administration's denials were nonsense. Democrats crowed at what they saw as a massive self-own by Trump's team.\n\nOutside of Trump loyalists, it seemed like just about everyone (including myself) had a good laugh at the expense of the administration's incompetence. But it's important to take a long step back and see what was taken for granted in all of this. Rather than being glad that he had a chance to expose what the war machine was up to, Goldberg thought the only scandal was that he'd been inadvertently handed the scoop. And nearly everyone else, in the media and in popular culture, seems to agree.\n\nThe attack killed dozens of people, most of whom were women and children. This happened in a desperately impoverished country already devastated by many years of intense conflict. Nor, of course, was Congress consulted about initiating a new round of violence against a country with which the United States is not in a state of war. And what the chat logs reveal about the planning for this war crime show a striking level of indifference to both its illegality and its human consequences.\n\nVice President Vance, supposedly an anti-interventionist, made the mildest objections, not on either of these grounds but because more European than American shipping was affected by Houthi attacks on ships going through Israel, and so the Europeans should be left to handle it. Or if the United States did do it itself, the administration should wait a few weeks to help explain to the public why it was important to intervene against the Houthis, a group most Americans know nothing about. That was it. Those were his only objections. And Tulsi Gabbard, who was also in the chat and has an even bigger reputation as an anti-interventionist than Vance (having basically built her political career off that reputation), didn't even echo these half-hearted concerns.\n\nIn fact, in what should have been the most shocking revelation in the second article, Goldberg shared a screenshot in which Waltz brags about having \"positive ID\" on a Houthi \"missile guy\" as that man was \"walking into his girlfriend's building.\" That building, Waltz crows, is \"now collapsed.\" And J. D. Vance's reaction to this stomach-churning confession of destroying an entire civilian apartment building to kill one person was, \"Excellent.\" A while later, Tulsi Gabbard chimed in , \"Great work and effects!\"\n\nMAGA's \"anti-interventionists,\" in other words, came off sounding a lot like . . . Jeffrey Goldberg. And the Democrats have been little better. When we take a step back from their obsession with process and \"opsec\" and look at the substance of the issue about Trump's war crimes in Yemen, there's not much daylight between the leaderships of the two parties. Everyone is fighting about whether the incompetence on display was disqualifying. The fifty-three dead people barely enter into the equation.\n\nAs Marxist academic Sam Badger wrote on Monday, an approximate equivalent situation would be if a group of mobsters in Las Vegas accidentally added a journalist to a group chat where they were planning to firebomb some rival gangsters whose main office was directly over an orphanage . . . and the headline the next day in the Vegas Sun was, \"Incompetent Mobsters Irresponsibly Expose Mafia Secrets.\"\n\nThe fire at the orphanage, of course, would be buried at the end of the article.\n\nBen Burgis is a Jacobin columnist, an adjunct philosophy professor at Rutgers University, and the host of the YouTube show and podcast Give Them An Argument .

(Al Drago / Bloomberg via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nSince Donald Trump triumphed over Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, the Democratic Party has been consumed by an ongoing Discourse War concerning what went wrong and who is to blame . Opinion sections, podcasts, cable news punditry, and social media feeds have been awash with finger-pointing in all directions. Some blame Joe Biden. Others point to Harris. Some lay responsibility at the feet of the party for its alleged capture by liberal and progressive causes. Others critique the party's failure to sufficiently embrace those same causes. The debate rages on.\n\nCombined with the dispiriting reality of looking down the barrel of a second Donald Trump administration, the often mind-numbing noise of the Democratic blame game raises a simple question: Does any of this hindsight-induced hand-wringing really matter? Or is the Democratic Discourse simply a lot of sound and fury, in the end signifying nothing?\n\nHistory suggests that these postelection debates really can matter, and that this particular round of internal party contention is likely to be especially consequential for our collective future.\n\nWhile it may seem like déjà vu all over again - the Democrats again finding themselves in a disoriented, leaderless state of drift, as they did after Trump's 2016 victory - the context has changed dramatically. Returning to power with a decisive, though narrow, Electoral College and popular vote victory, Trump has an opportunity to consolidate a durable realignment of US politics and policymaking that could last for a generation. Not only are he and his coalition more organized than last time, but the wider political order is coming apart . Having already achieved the greatest political comeback in American history, Trump now has a chance to define the shape of what comes next.\n\nHow Democrats respond to this challenge, and how they navigate a second Trump administration, will also determine the contours of the post-neoliberal order we are entering. How they formulate that response, and what social forces can sustain it, are the stakes of the current Democratic Discourse.\n\nImplicit in all diagnoses of a problem is a prescriptive remedy about how to fix it. Traditionally, political scientists expect that when a party loses an election, party leaders, interest group stakeholders, and allied activists will come together to try to figure out what went wrong. While the collective conversation can stretch on interminably, the basic idea is that the party learns from its mistakes and corrects course before the next election.\n\nWhat's wrong with this picture is that modern American parties are not really collective organizations with deliberative institutions, active memberships, or binding authority structures capable of having the kinds of conversations imagined by sanguine political scientists. Rather, as entities that bridge state and society, parties are contentious institutions that pull together differently situated political actors with conflicting interests and divergent agendas.\n\nCareer politicians want to pursue reelection above all else. Interest groups, think tanks, and party-aligned movements tend to prioritize the content of the policy agenda. Donors may oppose what movements demand, while officeholders may resent the demands of both. Although relations of mutual dependence pull them together, party coalitions are shot through with contentious politics.\n\nSuch a perspective on political parties casts postelection debates in a new light. While they may seem inconsequential, or an exercise in ass - covering by those trying to avoid blame, they present unique opportunities to shift the balance of party power and seize the initiative. When the incumbent party leadership is temporarily discredited by the sting of defeat, the party's electoral future is uncertain and its core identity is open to question; contending groups and aspiring party leaders can jockey for position.\n\nBeyond internal party conflicts of interest, another reason these postelection debates can be so contentious is that election outcomes don't speak for themselves. They tell us who won but not why they won.\n\nElection data can be sliced and diced in a number of different ways, with each analysis mobilized in support of distinct narratives that diagnose what went wrong and what to do about it. While some postelection analyses are more plausible than others, the true reasons why an election turned out one way and not another can never be pinned down definitively. As a result, postelection hot takes become fodder for the internal party struggle.\n\nThe outcome of the 2024 election, for instance, can be looked at in at least two very different ways. From one angle, when we strip away all the specifics of the campaigns and focus on what political scientists call \"the fundamentals,\" Harris's defeat appears entirely unsurprising. Despite her meteoric (though temporary) rise in the polls last summer, she was inevitably associated with a historically unpopular president who, rightly or wrongly, was held responsible for post-pandemic inflation.\n\nUnpopular incumbents governing over a period of inflation typically lose vote share in the next election. Indeed, 2024 was an especially cruel year for incumbent governments across the world. In comparison with other wealthy democracies, the US economy brought inflation down faster without sacrificing employment levels, perhaps explaining why this year's electoral referendum on the Biden economy was the least harsh of all electoral reckonings that year.\n\nNevertheless, according to this narrative, nothing was particularly surprising about the 2024 election: an unpopular incumbent administration lost decisively but narrowly, mainly due to economic circumstances beyond its control, repeating a pattern that looks very similar to 2016 and 2020.\n\nBut from another angle, we can tell a very different story that places the 2024 election in all its historical specificity. From this perspective, the outcome is perhaps one of the most extraordinary events in American political history.\n\nIn yet another previously unimaginable defiance of political norms and criminal law, Trump won reelection after attempting to overturn the outcome of the previous one. He is the first Republican to win the popular vote in twenty years. He expanded his coalition and grew his base of support in every single state of the country, compared to 2020. He also made significant inroads into traditionally Democratic metro areas. All of this was achieved by a candidate whose character flaws and political baggage are so monumental it is hard to believe that they wouldn't have disqualified any other candidate.\n\nIn this narrative, the fact that 2024 fits with a pattern of anti-incumbent reactions against inflation is irrelevant. What's important is the identity of candidates themselves: Trump as a historically unprecedented danger to the republic who got reelected , and Harris as the candidate who failed to stop him.\n\nWhich of these explanations is correct? For the purposes of the Democratic Discourse, it doesn't really matter. Postelection narratives are not so much empirical claims made about the world than they are political claims made on the world. They are the discursive material out of which factional forces can be marshalled, old guards can be challenged, and, sometimes, new internal party alignments can be cemented. Durable party transformation requires more than winning debates, of course. But prevailing in the postelection contest of ideas is a necessary part of that struggle.\n\nIf the Democratic Party's trajectory is significantly affected by the current postelection debate, it wouldn't be the first time in its history. While the seeds of party change are often planted by failed insurgent candidates, such as Bernie Sanders in 2016, it is in the fateful moments following electoral defeat when they are nurtured and take root.\n\nIn 1968, as the New Deal Democrats were torn apart by domestic and foreign policy disputes and a chaotic national convention, movement-aligned New Politics reformers capitalized on a moment of electoral disarray to advance a narrative that diagnosed the party's electoral crisis as an absence of party democracy. For a party whose male, pale, and stale leadership contrasted so sharply with the young and diverse movement activists flooding into its ranks, old guard defenders of the status quo had little to offer a rapidly changing society.\n\nWith the old way of doing things discredited, and pressure to reunify the party building ahead of the next election, a coalition of New Politics reformers and pragmatic party officials swept aside their opponents and installed the most far-reaching party reforms in American history. They lowered the barriers for participation, increased demographic representation, and sought to develop robust leadership accountability mechanisms.\n\nWhile election losses can open new opportunities for the Left, they can also do so for the Right. Before the most ambitious New Politics reforms could be fully institutionalized, counterreformers seized on the Democrats' 1972 landslide defeat as proof that the new reforms were disastrous. Reversing the 1968 narratives of New Politics activists, counterreformers claimed that party reform had resulted in too few party officials being included in the new presidential nominating process. With the sting of electoral defeat hanging over them, New Politics reformers and their allies were unable to prevent the partial rollback of their reform project.\n\nOver a decade later, in the wake of Ronald Reagan's second landslide victory, New Democrats grouped around the Democratic Leadership Council used the playbook to assail the party's alleged capture by liberal groups and make the case for severing the party brand from its \"big government\" legacy.  While not a guaranteed path to success, prevailing in the postelection debate has been a key facet of previous party transformations.\n\nThough the current round of intra-Democratic debate rages on, enough dust has settled to discern some core ideas, convergences, and emerging points of tension among the competing narratives. At the risk of oversimplification, we can sort them into three broad tendencies: left populist, new centrist, and accommodationist.\n\nPredictably, Bernie Sanders jumped into the fray without pulling any punches: \"It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working-class people would find that the working class has abandoned them.\" In the days and weeks that followed, progressives followed up with vocal endorsements for a revived left populism capable of countering the Trumpian alternative.\n\nThe friendly reception Sanders's statement received outside his amen corner was less predictable. Ezra Klein dedicated a whole podcast episode to the question, \"Would Bernie Have Won?\" Conservative columnist David Brooks wondered aloud , \"Maybe Bernie Sanders Is Right.\" In the face of the obvious success of Trump's MAGA movement, the left-populist critique seems to have struck a chord.\n\nA second predictable postelection narrative hails from the party center. In keeping with a tradition stretching back to the post-1968 counterreformers , many of these pollsters and former party strategists emphasize the off-centeredness of Democratic positions on what they consider hot-button \"social issues,\" especially trans rights. Much of the blame for Democratic electoral failure is laid at the feet of unchecked campus culture, use of \"woke\" terminology, and other Fox News-sounding villains.\n\nHowever, while there is continuity to this centrist narrative over the decades, there are also interesting signs of change. Signifying the underlying crumbling of the bipartisan neoliberal consensus, the new centrism has begun to shift away from the virtues of free markets and free trade and a technocratic obsession with procedure and process.\n\nFollowing the lead of Biden himself - a lifelong centrist - the vast majority of congressional Democrats voted for or announced their support for his revival of industrial policy. While only partially realized, the Build Back Better agenda would have constituted \"the most extensive package of economic benefits for working- and middle-class families\" since the 1960s, according to one analysis .\n\nBuilding a truly progressive alternative to the neoliberal order obviously requires much more than bold policy pronouncements. But as far as rhetoric goes, a \" bottom-up and middle-out \" economic agenda, and the underlying philosophy of modern supply - side economics embraced by Treasury secretary Janet Yellen, represent new positions for the formerly neoliberal party center.\n\nThe third tendency are those who have announced their readiness to accommodate themselves to the new reality and engage with Trump on his own terms. Whether due to the exhaustion of #Resistance or mere opportunism, accommodationist Democrats are extending feelers for cooperating on restricting immigration, cutting federal spending, and defending Social Security and Medicare. Rep. Ro Khanna has called for finding common ground with MAGA Republicans. In his first Truth Social post, Senator John Fetterman has recommended that Biden pardon president-elect Trump of all federal charges associated with his \"bullshit\" hush money payments to Stormy Daniels. Wittingly or otherwise, their efforts work to normalize Trump and the core themes of the MAGA movement.\n\nUndergirding all three positions is the growing recognition that Trumpism offers something quite appealing to many millions of working-class voters. If Trumpism is to be thwarted, either a left populism must win working-class voters back or a robust industrial policy must lessen inequality and insecurity. Otherwise, aspects of Trumpism will be appropriated by Democrats.\n\nWhich narrative will prevail is not clear or predictable. Much will depend on the many unknowns of the new Trump administration and how Democrats choose to navigate the post-neoliberal landscape.\n\nIn the wake of Harris's defeat, the New York Times ran an opinion piece by New York's lieutenant governor entitled, \"Democrats, It's Time to Say Goodbye to Our Neoliberal Era.\" While the piece rightly noted the ways in which Bidenism tried with very mixed success to do just that, it ignored the degree to which Trumpism has already said its goodbyes to neoliberalism and is in the process of ushering in something new.\n\nPolitical change, of course, isn't typically very sudden. We don't go to sleep in neoliberalism and wake up in something else. Political change unfolds at different speeds at different scales, often layering the new atop the old, displacing some of what came before while also generating frictions and outright contradictions as new and old interact and collide.\n\nThe neoliberal order has not vanished, nor will it ever entirely. After all, aspects of the New Deal order live on today, as the third-rail status of Social Security demonstrates. Long-standing neoliberal fantasies of gutting the federal government have found a new lease on life in Elon Musk's and Vivek Ramaswamy's Department of Government Efficiency , and abroad in Javier Milei's Argentina. But neoliberalism's glory days are behind us, and it is Trumpism and other right-wing populisms that are harvesting political capital from the wreckage it has left behind.\n\nIn this conjuncture, Democrats and other center-left parties around the world have a fundamental choice to make: continue to play the role of the loyal opposition in a political order defined primarily by the populist right, or mobilize a transformative ideological vision, viable electoral coalition, and distinctive set of policies capable of defining the political order itself.\n\nChoosing the latter will require accepting the failure of the popular front general election strategy Democrats have embraced for the past three presidential cycles. A coalition that, as Tim Walz bragged , ranges \"from Bernie Sanders to Dick Cheney to Taylor Swift\" will always be about defending the status quo, nor does it actually succeed in pulling Republican voters across the aisle . Even party apparatchik Rahm Emanuel can now admit that the status quo is broken and no longer defendable.\n\nNo doubt, the transformative choice is a tougher climb for Democrats. For decades, they have avoided spending the political capital necessary to push through legislation that would make it easier to form private sector unions, challenge business power, and foster a progressive social base at the heart of the party. There are some signs that an increasing number of Democrats are amenable to filibuster reform, which would lower the legislative hurdles to pro-labor legislation, and Biden did take significant though symbolic action to establish himself as a pro-union president.\n\nBut establishing a new political order requires more than just good policy. It means nothing less than resetting the very boundaries of politics and making what once seemed impossible possible. Over the past decade, that kind of politics has been nearly monopolized by Trump, to great effect. As he recently defended his worldview in a speech to the Economic Club of New York: \"Some might say it's economic nationalism. I call it common sense.\"\n\nEstablishing a new common sense, as Antonio Gramsci taught us, is what hegemony is all about. As Democrats cast about in search of a new party identity in a post-neoliberal world, it is more imperative than ever to present a political alternative to the authoritarian populism Trump and his enablers are normalizing. We have a clear choice: will the post-neoliberal order be shaped into something more just and democratic than what came before it, or is this now Trump's world and we just live in it?\n\nAdam Hilton is an associate professor at Mount Holyoke College.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

This past weekend, Sanders was back in the Hawkeye State, just twenty-seven miles away in nearby Iowa City, to talk to them about the path forward under a second Trump presidency - and drew an audience so big, he had to do a second speech immediately afterward to an overflow crowd in a separate venue.\n\n\"I've done a lot of speeches in my political life,\" he said as he came to the stage. \"This is the first time I've given one right after the other because we couldn't fit into the first venue.\"\n\nSanders's appearance is part of what he calls a coast-to-coast tour of the country, \"especially in conservative areas ,\" aimed at rallying the public against Donald Trump's agenda. One night earlier, thousands turned out, and hundreds were turned away, in Omaha, Nebraska to see the senator speak. On Saturday morning, hundreds more lined up in the cold Iowa winter to hear from the senator.\n\n\"Hope,\" Erin, forty-five, said she wanted from the event.\n\n\"It's just nice to listen to him,\" said Jai, forty-four, who came from nearby Fairfield. \"It's been a tumultuous month, and a Bernie pep talk will be nice.\"\n\nThat's more or less what attendees got. Sanders fused his familiar criticisms of US oligarchy with the Trump administration's unfolding efforts to dismantle the federal government, which have seen the White House work with billionaire Elon Musk, the world's richest man and the 2024 election's single biggest donor , to push through mass layoffs of federal workers and blanket deregulation of corporations.\n\n\"If you want to know who's running the US government, simply look at Trump's inauguration,\" Sanders said, referring to the presence of the three wealthiest men in America - Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Mark Zuckerberg - directly behind Trump, and what he called the thirteen \"junior billionaires\" with their net worths only in eleven figures, who he had tasked with running federal agencies.\n\nBut Sanders also aimed to galvanize a crowd whose participants had, before the rally, admitted feeling lost, worried, and even taking a break from the news for their own peace of mind. In a speech heavy on historical allusions, Sanders reminded the crowd that \"doing something important is never easy, \" insisted that \"now is the time to act\" and get politically involved, and that US history is filled with accomplishments that were meant to have been impossible, but that movements of ordinary people made happen - whether expanding suffrage, abolishing slavery, or winning independence from the king of England (\"an autocrat\").\n\n\"Trumpism is not going to be defeated by inside-the-Beltway politicians,\" he said.\n\nTogether with the overflow crowd, it was physical proof of the dissatisfaction with the Democratic Party seen in polls and angry phone calls to congressional offices, with voters complaining about a dearth of leadership and opposition to Trump from Democratic officials, and yearning for some kind of direction. Almost everyone Jacobin spoke to at Sanders's Iowa event was, to varying degrees, disappointed with the Democratic response to Trump's first month.\n\n\"What response?\" said Steven, forty-four, from Fairfield.\n\n\"It's been weak,\" said Cole, twenty-four, from Iowa City.\n\n\"Hakeem Jeffries is useless,\" said Jim, sixty-two, who had made the trip to Iowa from the Chicago suburbs, about the Democrats' leader in the House. \"'We can't do anything.' It's pathetic.\"\n\nRepublicans in Congress, in concert with Trump, are currently planning to pass a reconciliation bill that Sanders called \"the Robin Hood principle in reverse,\" handing the rich $1 trillion in tax cuts by making \"massive cuts to programs working people desperately need.\" But they only had a three-person majority in the House to do it, which meant just two of them voting \"no\" would kill the bill. Sanders noted that some of those Republicans were in the very districts he was visiting, and that they could be swayed by hundreds of constituents phoning their office to oppose the legislation.\n\n\"I'm in the Senate; it does matter,\" Sanders stressed. While congresspeople right now only worry about what their donors think, he said, \"your job is to make them worry about you.\"\n\nThere are already signs that vulnerable Republicans in districts whose communities heavily depend on programs like Medicaid are feeling the heat from their constituents over the planned cuts. Trump himself has felt the need to claim, falsely , that Medicaid is not \"going to be touched\" and has already once had to do a high-profile walkback of his sweeping pause on federal grants after constituent outrage at the resulting Medicaid disruptions put pressure on GOP congresspeople.\n\nFor Sanders, this grassroots effort to defeat Trump's agenda that he hopes to breathe life into is part of a long American tradition. Toward the end of his speech, he and the crowd together recited Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, and its call to ensure \"government of the people, by the people, for the people\" survives - not, Sanders stressed, \"a government of the billionaire class, by the billionaire class, for the billionaire class.\"\n\n\"That is what this struggle is about - one hundred and fifty years later, same struggle,\" he said.\n\nThere were signs that that struggle might be fought by a different base of support than Sanders attracted in his first presidential run a decade ago. Saturday's was an overwhelmingly liberal crowd that cheered and applauded Sanders's references to women's reproductive rights and jeered mention of Trump's cuts to the US Agency for International Development and attacks on Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky. Jai told Jacobin that many of his nonvoting friends in Fairfield who had initially been drawn to Sanders were now fully on the Trump train. Former union worker Otis, eighty-one, who had lived in Iowa for decades and seen its partisan loyalty shift red, said many of the young people he knew now supported Trump.\n\nBut at least among some, Sanders's speech seemed to have had its intended effect.\n\n\"I was that person who was complacent and checked out,\" said Audrey, twenty-seven, who had traveled the hour or so from Wapello to see Sanders for the third time in her life. The speech had given her the specific direction she had been yearning for.\n\nFor others, like Erin, who had come looking for hope, they found it just by being among hundreds of others who felt the same: \"I felt alone, and now it doesn't feel so much like that.\"\n\nBranko Marcetic is a Jacobin staff writer and the author of Yesterday's Man: The Case Against Joe Biden .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

But now that these two billionaires have created a constitutional crisis as they thumb their noses at democracy and lay waste to the government, the leadership of the supposed opposition party is flailing.\n\nHouse minority leader Hakeem Jeffries pathetically unveiled a new nickname for Trump this week: \"Captain Chaos.\" People across the political spectrum cringed . As one conservative New York City councilwoman asked, \"Why do they insist on making him sound cool?\" The moment, to many, evoked Hillary Clinton's ill-fated moniker \"Dangerous Donald.\"\n\nLike his Senate counterpart Chuck Schumer, Jeffries seems entirely unequal to this moment. He has also started a - wait for it - \"task force\" on Trump and Musk's destructive and illegal assaults on the federal government and its employees. In defense of this project, it does involve Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, one of the few House Democrats who does seem to be fighting tirelessly to expose and prevent the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) destruction. But the term \"task force\" almost seems deliberately chosen to sound pathetic and useless.\n\nEarlier this month, Jeffries whined, \"What leverage do we have?\" Even respectable voices in the mainstream media are losing patience with him: a Bloomberg opinion headline Friday read, \"Hakeem Jeffries needs to get it together .\"\n\n\"It's their government,\" Jeffries has said of the Republicans. No, Hakeem, it is our government. The government belongs to the people, not to the unelected Elon Musk. Trump was elected president, but that does not make him \"king,\" as he proclaimed himself the other day on Truth Social when announcing the end of New York City's hard-fought congestion pricing policy.\n\nThis Democratic weakness is particularly catastrophic given that people are ready to support opposition to Trump.\n\nLet's look at his \"ratings,\" a metric that the former reality star is particularly obsessed with. Throughout this month, according to a range of opinion polls, voters have disapproved of Trump in proportions ranging from 42 percent to a whopping (and historic) 54 percent .\n\nDemocratic voters extend that dissatisfaction to their own party. According to a recent CNN poll, a large majority, 73 percent, of Democratic-leaning voters feel that Democrats in Congress are doing too little to oppose Trump. And the approval rating of Congress itself is at an all-time low, suggesting that voters would also like to see some opposition from Trump's own party too.\n\nThe Democratic leaders' inaction is particularly bewildering in the context of a growing opposition movement.\n\nAll over the country, federal workers organized by the Federal Unionists Network (FUN), a new group that has been preparing for months for this onslaught, Jenny Brown has reported for Labor Notes , have been protesting Trump and Musk's massive and in many cases illegal firings. Musk has begun the process of firing 200,000 federal workers, and an estimated 20,000 have already been dismissed. The government functions affected include food safety, environmental enforcement, veterans affairs, consumer financial protection, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and much more.\n\nOn Wednesday, such workers took part in a nationwide day of action, gathering in over thirty cities for \"Save Our Services\" rallies, including in Boise, Chattanooga, Atlanta, and Philadelphia. Hundreds rallied in front of the Department of Health and Human Services, objecting to recent firings and their impacts on such necessary public goods as cancer, diabetes, and heart disease research . Federal workers have also been targeting Tesla showrooms, from Red Hook, Brooklyn to San Francisco, to highlight the unelected and especially unpopular critical role of Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, in the rampage.\n\nThe federal workers' resistance is growing and is supported by citizenry outside the government workforce, organized by groups like Indivisible, who don't want to see billionaire Musk eviscerating the numerous vital services that the government provides, as well as more conservative people who are showing up in American Revolution costumes. All over the country, on Presidents' Day, \"No Kings\" protests were unified in opposition to the Trump-Musk power grab.\n\nRather than taking these protests as a sign of the growing grassroots opposition to Trump and a mandate to do everything they can to stand up to him, Jeffries and others in the Democratic leadership have simply been annoyed by the resistance, according to an Axios article describing them as \"pissed\" and \"very frustrated\" with the activists.\n\nNot all Democratic leaders have been asleep at the wheel. Although New York governor Kathy Hochul has refused to remove compromised New York City mayor Eric Adams from office, she has been standing up for the city's independence in resisting Trump's efforts to dismantle congestion pricing. Senator Chris Van Hollen and others have been showing up to the protests.\n\nBut the Democratic Party leadership in Washington appears hellbent on proving that they're the only federal workers who really don't deserve their jobs.\n\nLiza Featherstone is a columnist for Jacobin , a freelance journalist, and the author of Selling Women Short: The Landmark Battle for Workers' Rights at Wal-Mart .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

By spurning economic populism and embracing Bush-era Republicans, Democrats helped pave the way for his second inauguration.\n\nKamala Harris and Liz Cheney laugh during a moderated conversation at the Royal Oak Music Theatre in Royal Oak, Michigan, on October 21, 2024. (Saul Loeb / AFP via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nFor years, the Democrats have painted Donald Trump and his version of the Republican Party as an existential threat to democracy. Leaning into this characterization, President Joe Biden's farewell address warned of an oligarchy taking over the country - a claim that is as true in the moment he said it as it was all those years before, when he didn't.\n\nOn Monday, Biden will welcome Trump to the White House as the duly elected president. On one level, this ceremony is simply the routine pageantry of governance, maintaining the decorum and structure expected of institutional continuity. However, given the Democrats' often apocalyptic framing of Trump and company, this passing of the torch highlights the disconnect between aesthetic rituals and the increasingly messy contradictions of contemporary politics. These standardized ceremonies, meant to signify unity and stability, are more vulnerable than normal to the charge of hypocrisy and artifice.\n\nOne of Biden's final acts as president was to name the country's next two aircraft carriers after former presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. Aesthetically, the act is both a masterpiece and a travesty: on one hand, a kind of wink and nudge at the nation's commitment to a peaceful transfer of power regardless of party; on the other, a convenient erasure of Bush's deeply controversial legacy.\n\nThe exact number of casualties from the Iraq War was never established, but it's in the hundreds of thousands and, by one account , roughly a million. A recent study of post-9/11 wars, including Bush's invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, estimates total deaths at around 4.5 million.\n\nThose wars and staggering death tolls, along with the Supreme Court's decision to hand Bush the presidency in 2000, seem forgotten. By some measures, perhaps the latter is now quaint. After Trump's disciples' naive attempts to overturn an election through a coup, Bush's coup by court seems rather orderly, maybe even genteel.\n\nBut there's a deeper problem in mindlessly observing the rituals of a democratic political system that is competitive but not, strictly speaking, typically violent. For Democrats, such gestures reveal not only their willingness to play by a different set of rules than their opponents but also a moral posturing - \"when they go low, we go high\" - that acts as a fig leaf covering the party's deeper failure to engage with the class-based dealignments that made Trump's victory possible in the first place.\n\nAs Trump rose to power, Democrats made common cause with neoconservative \"Never Trumpers,\" fawning over the Lincoln Project and clapping like seals for David Frum - a former Bush speechwriter - as he scolded Trumpism. In the 2024 election, the Kamala Harris campaign made an ornate show of winning Republican Liz Cheney - daughter of Bush vice president Dick Cheney - who also backed the Democrat.\n\nThe spirit and cluelessnes of the Democrat's attempt to woo Republicans was best captured by a sign that hung behind Harris and Cheney, a slogan adopted to capture the spirit of the alliance, during a conversation between the two: \"Country Over Party,\" it read.\n\nAs John Nichols points out in the Nation , \"while many Democratic tacticians were enthusiastic about Cheney's jumping on board as a Harris backer, Republican voters couldn't have cared less.\" Republicans repaid the patriotic, ostensibly bipartisan effort by voting for Trump in greater numbers than in 2020, a fact also noted by Nichols as \"a political fiasco.\"\n\nThere's nothing inherently wrong with trying to capture voters from the other side of the aisle. But the Democrat's appeal was not so much a substantive call to solidarity, based on a substantive program, as it was a mealy-mouthed call to \"unity.\" Trump, they warned correctly, is a threat to democratic institutions, even democracy itself. But they did not take into account the fact that plenty of people distrust those institutions and want something more. It is instructive to contrast this nebulous approach with the alternative path the Dems decided to dynamite - the one Bernie Sanders outlined in the speech announcing his 2016 presidential bid.\n\nSome Democratic insiders didn't love the Cheney play nor the ecumenical strategy. As Rolling Stone reports, a handful of them \" begged \" the Harris campaign not to do it, lest they alienate their base and fail to recruit converts from the other side. They were correct.\n\nIt's something worse than ironic that the strategy not only contributed to the Harris's loss but underscored the Democrat's embrace of figures and policies that exacerbated and entrenched the economic woes of the working class, fueling anti-elite, anti-system backlash. In doing so, they helped cement the conditions for Trump's ongoing success.\n\nNow that Trump will be sworn in as the forty-seventh president, the Democrats face a critical decision. They can observe the niceties of the parliamentary tradition and the requirements of officialdom while pretending that some chivalric order of partisan restraint governs the politics of the day. Or they can decide that the other side is indeed as bad as they've been saying it is in their fundraising emails - and behave accordingly.\n\nThe Democrats could even be so bold as to draw a line from Trump back to the Ronald Reagan era - accounting for the Third Way failures of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama along the way - and reflect on the economic, civil rights, and military abuses of the Bush Jr years. They might even consult the now famous 2014 paper by political scientists Martin Gilens and Benjamin Page that found that, for all intents and purposes, the United States isn't so much a democracy as it is an oligarchy. They might even note that the paper came out more than a decade before Biden's White House farewell suggested that the president himself had caught on to the problem.\n\nThe challenge for Democrats now will be to ignore the instincts of their think tanks and advisors who press for a pan-national strategy rooted not just in another era but another universe. Instead, they must recognize that class dealignment - a phenomena that some, at least, understand as stretching back to the Reagan years - is a problem that isn't just going to disappear. They need to appreciate that the Bush-era Republicans they seek to make common cause with are part of the problem - and that they will turn on the Democrats without warning.\n\nOnce the party has accepted that there's nothing to gain electorally by chasing a fantasy, or by preserving decorum above all at the cost of winning, the healing can begin. Then, with an agenda that is unapologetically focused on the working class and affordability - on dismantling Republican programs of deregulation and tax cuts, curbing oligarchic power, and committing to no longer enabling or taking part in foreign misadventures - they could find a path to political renewal and an actual chance of victory.\n\nDavid Moscrop is a writer and political commentator.

In the process, they sidelined working-class concerns, lost crucial voters, and still failed - not once, but twice - to accomplish their singular goal.\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden, US president Joe Biden, US president-elect Donald Trump, and Melania Trump stand together at the White House on January 20, 2025, in Washington, DC. (Andrew Harnik / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nFor the last three election cycles, the main project of the Democratic Party has been to keep Donald Trump out of office. Advancing policy to improve the lives of working people has been, at best, an afterthought and, at worst, a distraction. Every other aspect of politics has been deprioritized to favor this single goal, with \"vote blue no matter who\" emerging as the rallying cry.\n\nBut despite the elevation of beating Trump over important policy areas like health care, education, housing, worker protections, and so on, the strategy still failed - twice. Not only are working people now set to face the immense challenges of a second Trump term without any palpable progress that might have been achieved during the Joe Biden years, but the Democrats have also dramatically harmed their reputation and lost scores of working-class voters for nothing in the process.\n\nIn 2016, Bernie Sanders, running on a slate of policies designed to uplift the working class, faced unique opposition from within his own party and was presented as an unacceptable political risk . Hillary Clinton and the Democratic establishment, rather than learn from the surprising success of the Sanders campaign, blamed it for losing Clinton the general election.\n\nSanders faced the same interparty acrimony in 2020, with party elites coordinating the dropout of several popular primary opponents to boost Joe Biden's chances. In the end, when Biden stepped over Bernie into the White House, the best the Democrats could say about him was, \"Hey, at least he's not Trump!\"\n\nIn this most recent presidential election, Kamala Harris, especially toward the end of her campaign, succumbed to the fantasy that people were sufficiently afraid of Trump's dictatorial potential and losing democracy that they would look past her party's complete lack of major proposals to improve their material conditions. As even people close to the campaign have suggested , they were wrong.\n\nAs has been thoroughly laid out during this postelection hangover , working people were encouraged to leave their material and moral concerns behind the ballot booth curtain and check off the blue boxes. Forget Gaza - this is Trump we're talking about! Harris famously admonished Palestine solidarity protesters at a rally in Detroit: \"If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that,\" she said. \"Otherwise, I'm speaking.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign got off to a late but hopeful start , addressing (at least in rhetoric) economic inequality and bringing Tim Walz onto the ticket in an appeal to some segments of the working class. But the campaign's policy prescriptions never measured up to those early, coconut-pilled days. All in all, the Harris campaign sidelined universal health care (Harris no longer supports Medicare for All, despite its remarkable popularity), affordable housing (as Mathilde Lind Gustavussen wrote in Jacobin , the Harris-Walz housing proposal \"doubles down on the existing paradigm: more public subsidies, more tax incentives, and more empty hopes that developers will solve the housing crisis\"), labor reforms like passing the PRO Act (an unlikely outcome without filibuster reform and enduring lack of political will), and a minimum wage increase (Harris finally professed support for $15 an hour later in her campaign, but even that doesn't measure up to current costs of living), among other policies that could improve working people's flagging conditions. Reproductive rights were the only exception, and Harris only seemed keen to prioritize them for horse-race reasons, attempting to win over college-educated white women.\n\nThose voters who failed to \"understand the assignment\" by voting third party, uncommitted, or not at all became de facto Trump-MAGA supporters - as was demonstrated by a Harris campaign ad comparing Jill Stein voters to Trump voters. If this sounds familiar, one Democratic strategist from South Carolina stated that \"a vote for Bernie [is] a vote Trump\" - never mind the fact that, unlike Jill Stein, Sanders was actually running on the Democratic Party ballot line.\n\nThe Biden administration's four-year failure to make significant and convincing moves on its weightier campaign promises gnawed away at whatever trust still clung to the bone.\n\nFor example, student loan debt cancellation never panned out in the way in which it was promised. As of July 2024, federal student loan debt clocks in at $1.62 trillion, held by roughly 42.8 million borrowers. The Biden administration has canceled nearly $180 billion in federal student debt for 4.9 million borrowers (mainly through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program and for those on Income-Driven Repayment Plans), though it withdrew plans to cancel debt for some 38 million more in December.\n\nAs for Biden's promise to be the most pro-labor president, it may be true in relative terms, but the administration also fell short, failing to champion the PRO Act (which it kicked to Harris for use as a campaign promise) and blocking the railroad workers' strike over paid sick leave in the fall of 2022. Though his administration has made progress on labor issues - notably through appointments like Jennifer Abruzzo as general counsel to the National Labor Relations Board - this progress is likely to be short-lived due to the incoming administration's antagonistic position on labor rights.\n\nLikewise, despite the tangible immediacy of the climate collapse - never clearer than in the aftermath of the Los Angeles fires - no climate emergency has been declared. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which may not survive a second Trump term, is inadequate to meet this moment given that it will fail to reduce emissions to the goals set in the Paris Agreement.\n\nBernie Sanders summed up the situation after the election: \"It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working-class people would find that the working class has abandoned them.\"\n\nThe Democrats have not only failed to realize their own hollow project, but any lasting legacy of the Biden administration - as well as that of their Democratic colleagues - may soon be rendered null, merely a brief intermission between Trump's terms.\n\nThe IRA, the CHIPS Act, and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act stand as the Biden administration's signature policies, with the IRA hailed as the most consequential federal climate legislation ever passed. But as we careen toward the next Trump administration, these would-be legacy policies face serious threats. Biden's landmark climate legislation is already in the crosshairs of Senator Shelley Moore Capito, ranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee. Capito aims to dismantle the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and the Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grants, which together represent $30 billion - roughly 8 percent of climate-allocated funds. This January, Biden signed memorandums blocking future oil and gas drilling in 625 million acres of federal waters. But under the Congressional Review Act, lawmakers need only a simple majority vote to negate the executive action - or Trump can simply issue a memorandum reversing it.\n\nMoreover, Trump's outsized figure casts a shadow over everything in its orbit. History has a way of rounding edges and dulling details until events and people appear as mere impressions. It's hard to imagine Biden's legacy proving stronger than Trump's imposing narrative and the erosion of time.\n\nWhether Trump's next term will be defined by mass incompetence, lessons learned from his first term, or any of the myriad possibilities in between remains to be seen. What's certain is that this election wasn't a Trump victory so much as a Democratic defeat. With their legacy in serious jeopardy and four more years of Trump to weather, one would hope the Democrats would learn from their failure to achieve the one thing they prioritized above all else.\n\nBut if Democrats know anything, it's how to not learn a single thing. And now that Trump has had a full term out of office to rack up criminal charges, test the loyalty of his sycophants, and nurture his growing grievances, his second term has the potential to be even more consequential than his first.\n\nAshley Bishop is a New York-based journalist covering labor, climate, and social movements.\n\nSpencer Snyder is a journalist based in New York City with a focus on media criticism and politics.

This is a house in the country. This is a Rolls Royce and a Bentley. This is wine, women, and song ... and women.\"\n\n-Zero Mostel as Max Bialystock, The Producers , 1967\n\nMel Brooks' 1967 directorial debut, The Producers , is the story of two con men trying to win by losing. In this arch satire of show business, the once-successful Broadway producer Max Bialystock (played brilliantly by blacklisted fellow traveler Zero Mostel), has fallen on hard times.\n\nTo make ends meet, the venal and sleazy Bialystock has resorted to exchanging sexual favors with an exhausting rotation of widows who are as wealthy as they are insatiable. The ladies, in turn, fund the plays that he never actually intends on making, instead pocketing the money. When Bialystock's anxious accountant Leo Bloom (a maniacally tense Gene Wilder playing a man who carries around his baby blanket to soothe his erratic nerves) discovers a small but obvious discrepancy in the books, Bialystock persuades him to hide the fraud.\n\nBloom then off-handedly mentions that a flop could actually make Bialystock more money than a successful play; Bialystock could simply oversell shares. On a large enough scale, this kind of failure would allow him to keep investors' money and hide it all from auditors, who wouldn't think to investigate what appeared to be a disastrous loss. Bialystock runs with the idea, cutting in Bloom on the con, and they decide on the show they're sure will bomb: Springtime for Hitler , a Busby Berkeley-style musical extravaganza written by an actual Nazi, a \"love letter\" to the Führer himself.\n\nTo celebrate a con that appears to make use of their only skill, Bialystock and Bloom make a toast: \"Here's to failure.\" Of course, first they have to get investors onboard.\n\nHave you ever had a friend who has gotten themselves into trouble, and called you up at 3 AM to beg for a \"favor\"? Maybe they need to make a last minute \"purchase,\" or maybe they owe money to some people to whom one does not want to owe money. Either way, the desperation and manipulative urgency in their attempts to extract funds from you is unmistakable.\n\nOctober 24, 12:53 PM\n\nSubject Line: i don't like doing this\n\nOctober 24, 9:09 PM\n\nSubject Line: not the news I wanted to share\n\nOctober 25, 4:40 AM\n\nSubject Line: are you up amber?\n\nOctober 25, 12:47 PM\n\nSubject Line: embarrassing mistake\n\nOctober 25th 8:12 PM\n\nSubject Line: please read amber\n\nOctober 25, 10:11 PM\n\nSubject Line: amber, are you up?\n\nOctober 27, 10:57 PM\n\nSubject Line: unfortunately\n\nIt wasn't uncommon for Jaime Harrison, the challenger for Lindsey Graham's South Carolina Senate seat, to send e-mails literally naming himself as a bearer of bad news. At one point, his e-mails' sender name was actually changed from \"Jaime Harrison\" to \"bad news (Jaime Harrison).\"\n\nOctober 29, 2:43 PM\n\nSubject Line: Mitch McConnell is CRUSHING Our Campaign\n\nThat one was sent from \"game over [JaimeHarrison.com].\"\n\nOther little touches contributed to the histrionic juvenilia of his fundraising efforts - emojis in the subject lines, changing up fonts like a Vaporwave album, flash animations of Mitch McConnell being showered with money, etc. The last one is particularly ironic considering Harrison's own fundraising success: as of October 11, he had cleared $57 million in a single quarter - the most money raised by any Senate campaign in US history, many millions more than the previous record holder Beto O'Rourke, who topped off at $38 million in his third quarter. (He lost too.)\n\nTo many observers, Harrison's fundraising suggested that a successful campaign was at least possible. The polls, which put Harrison in fighting distance of Graham, also seemed to confirm this.\n\nIn the end, though, Graham crushed Harrison, winning by 265,000 votes - more than 10 percentage points.\n\nCuriously, this devastating loss doesn't appear to have dampened the spirits of Democratic optimists, many of whom have never been more proud of themselves. Take Adam Harris at the Atlantic , who wrote an article entitled \"The South Has Already Changed: Jaime Harrison Lost to Lindsey Graham but Expanded Democrats' Vision of What's Possible In the Deep South.\" What if losing is actually winning? Maybe the real Senate seats were the friends we made along the way.\n\nConfoundingly, Harrison's messaging calmed down after he lost, which does raise some skepticism about the authenticity of his frantic dread. In fact, his concession email is downright serene, overflowing with all the good sportsmanship of a Little League postgame handshake line. Harrison insists that although his campaign \"fell short,\" it \"brought hope back to South Carolina in a monumental way.\" He even claims that the \"state is better off for having run this campaign.\"\n\nNovember 3, 9:43 PM\n\nSubject Line: Thank you.\n\nTonight, Lindsey Graham won reelection to another term in the US Senate. I congratulate Senator Graham on his victory, and hope he brings the lessons he learned from this race back to Washington with him. But even in defeat, I'm so proud. I am proud of this movement that we've built, that allowed me, a round-headed boy from Orangeburg, to challenge Lindsey Graham and give him the fight of his political life.\n\nHow inspiring. Just a simple country lobbyist for the Podesta Group - where he represented such working-class heroes as Wells Fargo, Walmart, Bank of America, Google, and Nestlé, not to mention coal and pharmaceutical companies - a humble champion of America's poor who spent months begging for money at 3 AM, his tone vacillating between the simpering pleas of a booty call and the terror of a man who woke up to a decapitated horse head in his bed. Then, he loses badly, something he probably could have accomplished without the $57 million dollars.\n\nCampaigns like Harrison's raise the question: When Democratic candidates lose elections, is there any accountability for the Democratic Party operatives responsible? They don't lose their jobs; they remain in good standing in the larger Democratic firmament; they don't even seem to take a pay cut.\n\nJust as an especially egregious example, take Robby Mook, the former campaign manager for Hillary Clinton's disastrous 2016 campaign, who is now a senior fellow at Harvard's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, a CBS contributor, and president of the House Majority PAC. Given Mook's stellar record, it's no surprise that, at the time of writing, the Democrats appear to have lost House seats . Why don't absolutely titanic electoral losses ever seem to sink the careers of the people responsible?\n\nIt seems that the raison d'être of the Democratic Party is not to win power, but to sustain itself as a make-work program for progressive apparatchiks, the remaining representatives of the party's upper middle class, and dwindling, base.\n\nIn the last seventy-five years, the Democratic Party has actually lost its base twice. In the middle of the twentieth century, as the United States became, in John Kenneth Galbraith's words, an \"affluent society,\" the party transformed: gone were the labor leaders who had previously shaped it, replaced with a new wave of middle-class professionals. As time went on, this latter class became the party's core.\n\nBut over the past twenty years, as globalization has hollowed out the middle class, this new base declined in numbers, power, and influence, which has left the party to be operated by a shrinking, ever more insular group of out-of-touch professionals.\n\nSo, first a declining working class was displaced by ascendant professionals in a process of embourgeoisement , and then the downwardly mobile children of those same professionals succumbed to proletarianization. Nonetheless, the postwar professionals still hold the purse strings and steer the ship of the Democratic Party, which prevents it from moving left.\n\nIndeed, in an inspiring display of middle-class solidarity, party apparatchiks have continued to turn their backs on workers as they attempt to woo conservative suburbanites with the promise of a civilized party, but one that would never dream of subjecting them to redistribution.\n\nAs Biden informed wealthy donors in 2019, under his presidency \"nothing would fundamentally change.\" This statement advertises what we've all come to assume: as victims of their own success, Democrats no longer have a political project. Having won the major battles of the culture wars, all they have to offer potential converts is a vague feeling of moral superiority: \"vote Blue, because you're not a cretin or an ingrate.\" It's a presumptuous and sanctimonious argument, made all the more ridiculous by the fact that Democrats are big fat losers.\n\nIn contrast to the Democrats, the Republicans are very successful: they win elections and they've established themselves as the party of capital, with a proven record of enriching their base. Why would wealthy suburbanites switch to a losing brand when the only thing it offers is the same performance as your reliable old stand-by, which gets the job done without being smug about it? They might do so for one election, perhaps because they find Trump distasteful, but that's not a plan for long-term success.\n\nSo why do Democrats pursue this strategy, even as it continually fails? Insofar as the party now \"functions,\" it does so with the purpose of justifying its own existence, mostly in the grand tradition of \"job security.\" Ironically, the party has returned to its nineteenth-century roots as a party of patronage, but the recipients of this patronage are no longer impoverished Irish immigrants, they are educated would-be professional managers now adrift in the era of hyperglobalization.\n\nThe Democratic Party is now little more than a benevolent society, a make-work program for the fail-children of those Post-War professionals, who did not anticipate their inability to reproduce their class.\n\nOne might assume that the party's justification of its own existence would require some electoral success. Otherwise, wouldn't donations dry up? Over a long enough period of time, without at least minor victories here and there, this might be true. But assuming a product or service has to be \"good\" to survive falls prey to the same misconceptions of those who believe in the Darwinian natural selections of the free market.\n\nThere are two reasons why the Democratic Party persists in spite of itself. First, donations are a form of wealth transfer in an era of extreme inequality. The money that sustains the party doesn't come from the people who suffer when it fails them; it comes from the sort of very wealthy people whose lives remain largely comfortable no matter which party is in power.\n\nSecond, many Democrats believe that the party can't fail them; they can only fail the party. That's why, despite defeat after defeat after defeat, so many true believers return to their pocketbooks with renewed ardor, almost Millenarian in their absolute faith that the party's failure only proves that they need to be more deeply committed to it. That's also why failure can be very, very good for business.\n\nSo ... what if Democrats were losing on purpose?\n\nIn The Producers , Bialystock and Bloom's con backfires when Springtime for Hitler is an accidental hit. \"How could this happen?\" Bialystock wails. \"I was so careful. I picked the wrong play, the wrong director, the wrong cast. Where did I go right?\" Caught and convicted, the pair, as well as the Nazi playwright, are sent to prison, where they attempt to repeat their success (on purpose this time) by staging an actually good play: Prisoners of Love . Of course, it's utterly awful. It seems Bialystock and Bloom can succeed only when they're failing at failure.\n\nMany Americans can easily imagine a situation where a candidate wins office by accident; manifold observers have speculated that Donald Trump never wanted to be president, especially considering how many opportunities he's fashioned for himself out of \"losses\" in the past. As his tax returns have shown, Trump has profited time and again from filing for bankruptcy, which is common practice for investors who avoid paying taxes by declaring their fiscal year a net loss. (Student loans, however, can't be discharged in bankruptcy.)\n\nCould the top brass at the Democratic Party be capable of this kind of cynicism?\n\nLike most conspiracy theories, questions like these are more entertaining than they are pressing. The truth is, it doesn't really matter if the Democrats are trying to lose; what's important is that their political strategy is indistinguishable from that of a party trying to lose.\n\nMaybe, like Harrison's concession e-mail suggests, Democrats believe that running candidates is more important than building or - god forbid - wielding power. Maybe they're taking the hits now to build up a war chest for the future. Maybe they just suck at their jobs.\n\nOr maybe, the Jaime Harrison campaign was a big, fat \"Springtime for Hitler.\"\n\nThe idea of it makes for great comedy, but ultimately it's not worth twisting your brain into knots trying to figure out the Democrats' motives. In the end, for the people who need political solutions to live dignified lives, ineptitude and intention are a distinction without a difference: the most important takeaway is that Democrats are losers, whether they're throwing the fight or getting KO'd in the first round.\n\nAnd no one likes a loser.\n\nDaniel Bessner is the Joff Hanauer Honors Associate Professor in Western Civilization in the Henry M.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe Democratic Party may have recaptured the White House, but its crisis remains as deep as ever. Though Joe Biden beat Donald Trump by 7 million popular votes, his Electoral College victory came down to 42,000 ballots in Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin. Democrats barely won the Senate, lost seats in the House, and were stonewalled at the state level - of the twelve legislative chambers Democrats had targeted there, they won zero.\n\nFar from celebrating a landslide victory, with hopes of a national realignment on the way, Democrats found themselves once more engaged in a tense debate about the future of a party that seems incapable of decisively winning control of all branches of government.\n\nOn this question, the progressive and centrist wings of the party are more divided than ever. Conservative Blue Dog Democrats like Abigail Spanberger blame radical rhetoric for the party's poor results in Congress: \"we need to not ever use the words 'socialist' or 'socialism' ever again. Because while people think it doesn't matter, it does matter. And we lost good members because of it.\"\n\nIn response, our left-wing leaders like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez contend that the Democrats will fail to mobilize their most enthusiastic voters if big-ticket progressive ideas get dropped from the agenda. They argue that the party's biggest liability was its unimaginative, uninspiring, and thoroughly orthodox economic conservatism. Joe Biden's promise that \"nothing will fundamentally change\" might have won over some moderates disgusted with Trump, but it failed to inspire voters to elect a Democratic majority.\n\nMeanwhile, despite losing a presidential reelection bid, many Republican leaders seem unconcerned with the results. After all, Trump managed to improve on his 2016 performance in nearly every demographic group, save college-educated voters and white men. Biden, however, failed to reverse the Democrats' slow bleeding of working-class voters of all races, so much so that Republican senator Marco Rubio boasts that the GOP is now the party of the \"multiracial working class.\"\n\nDemocrats know they are in trouble, and most of them recognize the problem: their base is too narrow. It is too geographically metropolitan, too educated, and, increasingly, too wealthy.\n\nWhat Democrats most need, then, is a way to build a larger working-class coalition. And this, too, is the crux of the debate between progressive insurgents and establishment politicians: each wing of the party accuses the other of being unable to win working-class voters.\n\nMaybe they're both right.\n\n\"Left but not woke\" was how commentator David Frum once described Bernie Sanders. In his 2016 bid for the Democratic nomination, Sanders's economic platform was decidedly ambitious and his rhetoric indisputably populist. In an era of small-government austerity and technocratic solutionism, Bernie often sounded like a New Deal dinosaur, blissfully unaware that history had ended in the 1990s, or that Democrats had become a party of right-thinking college graduates rather than blue-collar workers. He offered a worker-centered economic agenda, without the alienating cultural aesthetic that dominates liberal media and the universities.\n\nNo one can deny Sanders's influence on the future of the US left. His platform has upended the policy consensus on Capitol Hill, and his talking points are now regularly imitated by down-ballot candidates across the country.\n\nYet many of his most outspoken disciples fail to embody his unique appeal. Instead of the single-minded focus on working-class issues, they often embrace the liberal culture war while peppering in some of Bernie's popular programs. So, if Bernie is the progressive exception, then what is the rule?\n\nConsider Elizabeth Warren's campaign, which even the ultraliberal magazine the Atlantic chided for its \"Excessive Wokeness.\" Warren combined a popular economic agenda with an often awkward attempt at courting Teen Vogue -reading radicals. This approach was admired among activists, media commentators, and some professional-class voters, but almost no one else - especially not the oppressed groups she aimed to attract. Warren came in fourth among black voters in her home state.\n\nWarren is far from unique, though, and the brand of politics she championed is certainly not dead - in deep blue districts, it might even be the norm. The members of the Squad - long thought to be the successors to the Sanders mantle - have welded Bernie's economic agenda to activist demands like \"defund the police\" and political appeals that, whatever their merits, seem best at attracting the hyperliberal and highly literate.\n\nProgressives and socialists are now pairing ambitious and urgently necessary proposals like Medicare for All with wildly unpopular and sometimes counterproductive policy positions. Further, progressives have embraced a racialized worldview that reduces whole populations to their skin color. \"Woke\" ideology has prevented many on the Left from grasping the possibility that a Mexican American may care more about health care than immigration, that a woman might be more motivated by economic promises than electing a first female president, or that Trump might be able to improve his vote share among working-class black voters.\n\nEven the political style of the Left seems designed to turn away potential new recruits. Far from signaling a commitment to vital social causes, being \"woke\" has become synonymous with an embrace of niche cultural attitudes found only in highly educated urban districts and among Twitter users - 80 percent of whom are affluent millennials. The Sanders campaign attempted a break with the new online consensus when it rejected the fringe term \"Latinx\" in its historically successful efforts to court Latino voters. And while Sanders failed to win over infrequent, rural, and small-town voters, he recognized how important it was to craft a majoritarian message that could appeal to them.\n\nIt's unlikely that younger progressive leaders will do the same. Standout representatives like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, and Rashida Tlaib sit in districts teeming with young, liberal voters (each seat boasts a Democratic advantage of at least 29 percentage points). For urban progressive insurgents - who are cash poor and enthusiasm rich - the incentives are clear: \"woke\" messaging helps mobilize an activist volunteer base that allows these candidates to overcome their financial weaknesses vis-à-vis established incumbents, and since these districts are so uniformly Democratic, they need not worry about appealing to a broader group in a general election. But even as these progressives have marooned themselves on isolated blue urban islands, they insist more than ever on defining the terms of national debate. And thanks to their unusually strong access to media, they've been quite successful at this.\n\nThe political problem here is not the moral motivation behind the \"Great Awokening\" - there is no doubt that progressive Democrats have the best of intentions. The problem is the way in which that moral conviction is expressed, and by whom. Party insurgents today reflect the sensibilities and interests of a constituency that looks and sounds nothing like the kinds of voters the Left desperately needs to win.\n\nAfter all, professional-class progressives only make up about 13 percent of the electorate, and they almost never vote for anyone other than Democrats. Alternatively, as Peter Hall and Georgina Evans show, about 22 percent of voters dislike cosmopolitan and increasingly out-of-touch liberal cultural appeals but believe in a progressive economic agenda - and these voters are largely working class. Winning the loyalty of the majority of working people in this country will require breaking out of the existing liberal fortresses and appealing to workers across our massive continental democracy. But pairing a popular economic program with alienating rhetoric, chic activist demands, and identity-based group appeals only weakens the possibility of doing so.\n\nIf progressives are trapped by an unpopular political style, many Democratic leaders have carefully distanced themselves from it. You didn't catch Amy Klobuchar gushing about new activist campaigns. And Biden didn't bother to even flirt with woke posturing and academic invocations of \"intersectionality\" the way that Hillary Clinton did in 2016.\n\nBiden presented himself as a reliable and likable moderate - someone to steady the ship after Trump's rocky tenure and the insurgent challenge of the Sanders campaign. And, since the election, establishment figures have seized on every opportunity to tie Bernie's popular economic agenda to the more controversial ideas championed by some of his supporters. Spanberger chided the Left to \"never say defund the police again,\" but the congresswoman was careful to tie the slogan to \"socialism\" and other more popular economic policies. (Bernie himself never embraced \"defunding the police,\" and instead argued consistently for better training and more accountability.) Similarly, Representative James Clyburn insisted that the \"defund\" slogan was as much a liability for Democrats as Medicare for All. Progressives, therefore, have made it easy for moderates to attack an appealing left-wing economic program by simply associating it with the most unpopular pillars of the progressive agenda.\n\nIn contrast, centrist Democrats and conservative \"Blue Dogs\" have combined moderate rhetoric with a mostly orthodox economic program. Their charge to the Left is to \"grow up.\" To win seats, they argue, drop the socialism. But while Spanberger squeaked out a victory in Virginia's rural heartland, dropping socialism - or even attacking it at every turn - hasn't prevented her fellow Blue Dogs from becoming a nearly extinct political breed. The conservative Democratic caucus has only twenty-six members in the House, down from fifty-six under Barack Obama. As alienating as woke rhetoric is, a politics that does nothing to address wage stagnation and general economic and social decline isn't winning many over either.\n\nIt's undeniable that Democrats in rural areas face steeper challenges than their urban and suburban counterparts, but curiously, two outstanding victories for swing-district small-town Democrats were Matt Cartwright in perennially purple Pennsylvania and Peter DeFazio in Oregon. Both are Medicare for All cosponsors; both held on to their seats even as at least seven more Blue Dogs went down to defeat. It should be plain that Spanberger's rage at progressives is at least as much an expression of frustration that the Blue Dog formula also seems to be failing.\n\nThe establishment may credibly argue that hyperliberalism is an electoral liability for the whole Democratic brand, undermining House members who have never claimed any activist bona fides. But what do these Democrats make of the equally credible argument that policies like government health insurance and a $15 minimum wage are widely supported even in districts that make Spanberger's look liberal?\n\nMainstream Democrats are fundamentally unwilling to renew their commitment to the New Deal ethos of social programs and union rights. Consequently, they are unwilling to rebuild the kind of electoral coalition that brought them a half-century of political supremacy.\n\nWorse, the Clintonite commitment to economic \"modernization\" has led the party to a political disaster. The promise was that manufacturing job losses would be offset by widespread economic prosperity, built on Silicon Valley magic and the financial sector's charge-card plastic. The reality was that the elite economic consensus - tax cuts and balanced budgets - resulted in unparalleled economic decline in midwestern \"blue wall\" states.\n\nDisastrous trade agreements only helped accelerate the depression of wages and the inflation of despair in hollowed-out old factory towns and cities. History will judge the Democrats' passage of NAFTA as nothing less than the first signature on their own death certificate.\n\nFor the Democrats to win back their New Deal (or even Obama-era) constituency, they need to credibly appeal to the economic interests of working people. Unfortunately, moderates in the party are unwilling to offer workers much more than a wry smile and a charming affect. Progressives, meanwhile, do promise real solutions - but only after they drench those appeals in a cultural style born in universities that most people will never attend. The effect in both cases is the same: Workers stay home. And the Democrats lose more and more of the country.\n\nOne way of looking at the past twelve years of American politics is to say that, in both 2008 and 2016, workers voted for the \"change\" candidate. They voted for perceived outsiders, and they voted against Washington. Both Barack Obama and Donald Trump argued that, through their personal charisma and skill, they could save workers. In both campaigns, workers voted for a candidate who promised to take on elites, renegotiate NAFTA, rebuild our education system, and stem the poverty, disease, and violence that plague so many American neighborhoods.\n\nFor over a decade now, the electorate has been screaming at the political class that something must be done and that the government must change course. But the government, under both Obama and Trump, largely ignored them. Nothing significant has changed in these last twelve years. Congress remains in a permanent state of dysfunction.\n\nMeanwhile, the issues workers most prioritize are an afterthought in the media and among the political class. The domination of American politics by the affluent and the educated has led to a dramatic rift in the public sphere and a deep cleavage between rural and urban workers and those with and without a college degree. Within the Democratic coalition, in particular, the gap between workers and professionals has grown wide. In fact, the difference in priorities seems at least as significant as the self-identified ideological divide between the establishment and progressives.\n\nAccording to a report from the Democracy Fund Voter Study Group, Democratic-leaning working-class voters ranked their top five issues as follows: health care, social security, Medicare, the economy, and jobs. But liberal professionals listed theirs as: environment, climate change, health care, education, and racial equality. By comparing rankings, we can see great chasms between groups: While crime was listed sixth for workers, professionals' concerns about crime placed way down in position seventeen. And while workers listed the economy as their number-four concern, professionals saw it as twelfth in line. For professionals, climate change was a top issue in this election - for workers, it didn't even break the top ten.\n\nAcross the board, professionals insist on issues far from the kitchen table, while workers vote almost entirely on direct economic concerns. The Democratic strategy of consolidating their urban and suburban electorate has only resulted in a deepening embrace of issues that narrowly reflect the interests of that constituency. After all, if your party is courting wealthy, mostly white, professional-class voters, you will pitch campaigns designed to attract those voters.\n\nWhat's more striking is that - though progressives insist on going much further than centrists on any given policy - the white-collar priorities of both wings of the party were represented in Biden's campaign. In his victory speech, Biden reiterated his ultimate intentions:\n\nTo marshal the forces of science and the forces of hope in the great battles of our time. The battle to control the virus. The battle to build prosperity. The battle to secure your family's health care. The battle to achieve racial justice and root out systemic racism in this country. The battle to save the climate. The battle to restore decency, defend dem-ocracy, and give everybody in this country a fair shot.\n\nNotice that, of the top-priority issues for Democratic working-class voters, only health care was explicitly referred to - coincidentally, it is also a top issue for professionals. If you understand nothing else about American politics, understanding that professional-class issues dominate Democratic appeals will help you make a great deal more sense of the world than incessantly scratching your head during every election cycle about just why it is that workers keep \"voting against their interests.\"\n\nThe fact is, neither workers nor their interests are even on the menu.\n\nThe consequences of neglecting workers' interests are clear: Washington will remain dysfunctional. On the one hand, in order to reverse the bleeding of working class voters - especially in rural areas and small-towns - the federal government must act decisively to reverse the economic decline wrought by decades of reckless shortsighted policy making. On the other hand, until and unless progressive forces figure out how to win outside of large urban areas, the Left will remain legislatively impotent.\n\nCentrism is a dead end that promises nothing but razor-thin victories, divided government, and an ever-shrinking share of working-class votes. But getting \"woke\" also means alienating most voters - of all colors - and handing the Republicans easy layup victories at the polls. Still, it will probably take more than a rhetorical adjustment to regain the confidence of working people.\n\nStruggling Americans want jobs, health care, decent schools, safe neighborhoods, and somebody - anybody - in Washington to listen. But why would they listen? Democrats today represent the richest House districts in the country, and Republicans consistently send the wealthiest individuals to Washington. The median income in Congress is 500 percent greater than that of the nation at large - half of our federal legislators are millionaires.\n\nCongress is richer than ever, yet both parties have gloated about their success in \"diversifying\" the chambers: today, 24 percent of lawmakers are women, 22 percent are racial or ethnic minorities, and more than 5 percent are of foreign birth.\n\nOnly 2 percent come from a working-class background.\n\nThe case for increasing the representation of minorities and women in Congress has rightly been accepted as both morally correct and politically effective. Yet, in recent memory, there has never been a forceful case for improving the representation of workers. But this is exactly what must happen if we are to avoid the two dead ends of centrism and hyper-liberalism examined above.\n\nDepending on your definition, \"the working class\" makes up between  55 and 70 percent of the country. The vast majority of this group shares a great deal in common politically, but in our broader political culture, working people are more often expected to sort themselves into groups euphemistically called \"communities\" than they are encouraged to think of themselves as part of a class. What's more, workers almost never get to vote for other workers on the basis of their shared experiences, aspirations, and interests as workers.\n\nOn almost all major economic questions, lawmakers from blue-collar backgrounds are reliably more progressive than their white-collar counterparts. Working-class legislators are also more likely to come from the districts they are seeking to represent, more likely to come from oppressed groups, and more likely to sound like and speak to the discrete interests of their potential voters.\n\nIn other words, there is no good reason not to run working people for Congress. There is only one very bad reason, and that is the fact that many progressives, moderates, and conservatives alike plainly think working people are stupid and culturally backward. As a result, no one asks them, or creates the material conditions that allows them, to run.\n\nPolitical scientist and author of The Cash Ceiling Nicholas Carnes credits this fact as one major reason working people do not run for office. Democratic socialists have a special responsibility to change this - what does workers' government mean if not workers in government? Doing so would also help us avoid many of the problems outlined here and potentially allow progressives to break out of their blue bubbles.\n\nThe good news is that representatives Mark Pocan, a longtime member of the painters' union, and Donald Norcross, the House's only electrician, have recently announced a new labor caucus in Congress that could provide a means for doing just that. The caucus seeks to advance the interests of organized and unorganized workers alike. Presumably, it will also endeavor to increase the representation of workers in Congress. If these labor legislators can develop a serious program for the recruitment of workers to run for office, financed by local union PAC contributions and buttressed by big volunteer get-out-the-vote campaigns - especially in the small-town and rural districts where liberals struggle - they could provide a path out of the morass.\n\nIn Norcross's home state, the New Jersey AFL-CIO's Labor Candidates Program has to date secured more than a thousand election victories for unionists and could serve as a model for candidate training and campaign development. In close connection with the congressional Labor Caucus, such local efforts could help develop the political arm of the labor movement while also exciting rank-and-file members who are more likely to mobilize and support their union sisters and brothers than they are any Johnny-come-lately Democrat who only shows up at election time.\n\nFor the Left, pivoting toward recruiting worker candidates and retooling a campaign message to speak primarily to the economic interests of wage workers - in rural and urban districts alike - is a function of will. Progressive leaders in Congress are not tied down by corporate donations or deals with party elites that would prevent such a change in direction. And left-leaning Democratic and independent voters are overwhelmingly in favor of the kinds of pro-worker legislation that trade-union candidates might put forward.\n\nOf course, there is no guarantee that working-class candidates armed with a bold economic agenda will break the powerful geographic bias against the Left. At best, the strategy offers only a slow and uneven advance. But it is also true that we have no chance to deliver the reforms we hope to see with a constituency made up of high-earning and highly educated liberals.\n\nUntil then, the Democrats will remain the party everyone loves to hate.\n\nDustin Guastella is director of operations for Teamsters Local 623 in Philadelphia.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

We welcome their hatred.\n\nMinnesota representative Ilhan Omar speaks at an event outside the US Capitol on April 30 in Washington DC. Win McNamee / Getty\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nLast month, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) introduced new rules intended to stymie electoral challenges from the left. The group announced that it would no longer give any work to consultants, pollsters, and other political professionals who lend their efforts to progressives and democratic socialist candidates seeking to depose Democratic Party incumbents, as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez did last summer when she unseated establishment Democrat Joe Crowley.\n\nMembers of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, including Ocasio-Cortez, are right to speak out against these measures, which are designed to weaken the Left. Since the left wing is already weaker, forcing professionals to choose between the Left and center means they're likely to gravitate to the center to protect their own careers, starving the left wing of resources and expertise. The move is an attempt to leverage the self-interest of the professional political class against a political movement that threatens corporate profits and centrist dominance, which are extensively entangled.\n\nOne wonders, given the extreme resistance to the Left from the Democratic Party establishment, why progressives and democratic socialists should run as Democrats at all. Unfortunately, the unique characteristics of the US two-party system make it nearly impossible in many cases to run viable and impactful third-party campaigns. That means that in order to widely project a pro-working class message while still potentially winning a race, many progressive and democratic socialist candidates are compelled, for the time being, to run on the Democratic Party ballot line - that is, to run as putative members of a party that detests them.\n\nThe ballot-line approach presents two clear and present dangers: stonewalling by the party elite and cooptation into the party machinery. The Democratic Party knows its way around both. In this instance, likely acting out of sheer panic, it has opted for stonewalling.\n\nBut stonewalling has some advantages over cooptation for insurgent candidates genuinely interested in creating a new working-class political movement in defiance of the Democratic corporate consensus. If they won't give you anything, you don't owe them anything. By making it clear that the party won't provide resources to the Left, Democrats force progressives and democratic socialists into a position of independence. That may make it somewhat harder to win elections, but in the long run, relative independence will serve the movement well - so long as it can sustain its popular momentum.\n\nIn fact, forced independence might actually compel progressive and left-wing candidates to adopt the very strategies that are necessary to build and sustain a mass base. If you can't rely on a readymade political machine, you need to build a machine of your own. Instead of sharing the political professional class with its opponents in the Democratic Party, the Left will need to build its own army of experts and operators - an army that, once assembled and trained, can be deployed to other blacklisted campaigns.\n\nBy the same token, if you don't have access to a network of elite donors, you need to find new ways of speaking to ordinary people that inspire them to fork over their hard-earned money. If you're not getting fed, you don't have to worry about biting the hand that feeds you. You can, and indeed must, stand for an ambitious politics that can get working people's attention by promising to radically transform their lives: for Medicare for All, fully funded public childcare and education at all levels, a Green New Deal, massive social housing investment, a job guarantee with a living wage, and soaking the rich to pay for it all and redistribute our nation's obscenely concentrated wealth.\n\nCutting off the Left therefore has the potential to backfire on the center, pushing candidates to be more courageously independent in order to win the hearts of the masses - the only way to make up for what they lack in top-down support. And in the process of running those audacious insurgent campaigns, progressive and democratic socialist politicians can raise the expectations of the working class and create new constituencies for policies and politics that the Democratic center dismisses out of hand.\n\nEmboldening-by-abandonment is much more promising for the growth of a left mass movement than the alternative scenario - where Democrats play nice with the Left in an attempt to co-opt its leaders and neutralize its political threat. The DCCC's scorched-earth tactics have a silver lining: if political consultants are forced to reject insurgent campaigns, they can't remake insurgent campaigns in their image.\n\nThis isn't to say that cooptation is entirely avoidable. The Democratic Party is not a political party in the traditional sense, with members and internal democracy and a mandate to answer to the needs and desires of its constituency; it's a Rube Goldberg machine made out of carrots and sticks. Progressive and democratic socialist politicians who win elections as Democrats are likely to be subjected to a litany of bribes and punishments, which take enormous effort to resist. Newcomers like Ocasio-Cortez , Rashida Tlaib , and Ilhan Omar are at the very beginning of this long and arduous journey, and despite their personal integrity and their antagonism to the party establishment, their fates cannot be predicted.\n\nTheir best shot at surviving the gauntlet is if the movement on the ground continues to grow in both size and political clarity. There's a real hunger among the American working class for change - for an end to stagnating wages, rising living costs, ballooning debt, and crushing austerity. And as the unexpected success of Bernie Sanders's dark-horse campaign showed in 2016, there exists a potential constituency for a mass left-wing movement.\n\nThe formal parliamentary expression of that constituency is not a foregone conclusion - progressives and democratic socialists will have to work tirelessly to build the movement into a real threat to establishment power. But alarming signs of its strength and coherence are precisely what have prompted the Democratic Party to act with such aggression.\n\nThe DCCC has drawn its sword. But it mistakes the left-wing insurgency for a snake, when it may be a hydra instead.\n\nMeagan Day is a staff writer at Jacobin .

However, that isn't the case this year. On Tuesday, we got two major results out of two elections in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn the Pennsylvania state House, Democrats won a special election that will hand them control of that legislative chamber. The win wasn't much of a surprise since it was considered a Democratic-leaning district. In November, Kamala Harris won it by 16 points. That said, there was still a bit of good news for Democrats, because even though Harris won that district by 16 points, on Tuesday the Democratic candidate, Dan Goughnour, did even better - he won by nearly 30 points. That's a huge margin, and reason alone for Pennsylvania Democrats to celebrate.\n\nRepublicans are reportedly growing concerned after the Democratic candidate out-fundraised the GOP candidate by more than 10-to-1.\n\nBut there was also another election in the state, this one for a seat in the Pennsylvania state Senate. The seat had previously been held by a Republican and it was seen as a really red district. In November, Donald Trump won it by 15 points. But Tuesday, James Malone, a Democrat, managed to flip the seat.\n\nThis is turning into a theme for Democrats. This year already, the party scored a huge upset win in Iowa. There, Democrat Mike Zimmer won a state Senate election in a district Trump carried by 21 points in November. And earlier this month, Democrats in Minnesota won a contest for a state House seat, electing Doron Clark. In that case, that district was heavily Democratic and the party expected to win there - but I don't think they expected to win by a whopping 70 points.\n\nAll of this good news for Democrats comes as we are awaiting three very big special elections next week. In Wisconsin, there is a race that will determine control of the state's Supreme Court - and, by extension, the future of abortion rights and voting rights in that state.\n\nIt's technically a nonpartisan race but Elon Musk's super PAC has poured more than $10 million into supporting the candidate favored by Republicans. Musk's PAC is also offering voters $100 if they sign a petition against activist judges, thereby helping identify people for the party's \"get out the vote\" efforts.\n\nThanks to Musk, Wisconsin's Supreme Court race is now the most expensive judicial election in U.S. history .\n\nThere are also two special elections in Florida next week, one race to fill the congressional seat vacated by Trump's national security adviser and group chat enthusiast , Mike Waltz, and another race to fill the seat vacated by the president's first pick for attorney general, Matt Gaetz. (The one who had to withdraw his name following lack of GOP support in light of previous allegations of illicit drug use and sex with a minor - all of which Gaetz denies.)\n\nThose are both considered heavily Republican districts. But in Waltz's old district, Republicans are reportedly growing concerned after the Democratic candidate out-fundraised the GOP candidate by more than 10-to-1, which means that even though this is a very Republican district, Democrats are clearly putting up a fight.\n\nWatch this space.\n\nRachel Maddow is host of the Emmy Award-winning \"The Rachel Maddow Show\" Mondays at 9 p.m. ET on MSNBC. \"The Rachel Maddow Show\" features Maddow's take on the biggest stories of the day, political and otherwise, including in-depth analysis and stories no other shows in cable news will cover.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

      "text": "Democrats are in disarray. That's a good thing.\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer was supposed to be touring the country this week, signing and selling copies of his new book. Instead, the New York senator postponed the whole tour over \"security concerns.\" More specifically, the concern was that liberal activists, angry at his decision to acquiesce to Republicans' recent government funding bill , were planning large protests at every event.\n\nIt's undoubtedly embarrassing for Democrats that their leader in the Senate is ducking scenes of being called a coward by voters in his own party. But that the very fact that the party's base is so livid at its leadership could be good news. Recent history tells us that that anger may be crucial if the Democrats are to come back from their current lowly position.\n\nAnd that position is truly lowly. In new polls by NBC News and CNN , the Democratic Party has reached its lowest approval rating ever recorded: 27% and 29%, respectively. In both cases, these declines came about because many Democrats now say they disapprove of their own leadership.\n\nVoters in the Democratic base are clearly hungry for representatives who will oppose Trump loudly and without embarrassment.\n\nAnd why wouldn't they? As Democratic voters watch in dismay while Donald Trump and Elon Musk dismantle the federal government and explore new frontiers of authoritarianism, they see few encouraging signs from too many of their leaders. The three living Democratic ex-presidents haven't been heard from since Trump took office. Former Vice President Kamala Harris has been mostly invisible. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, whose presidential ambitions are no secret , is chatting it up with far-right activists and commentators on his new podcast. And while House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, unlike Schumer, kept his caucus together to oppose the recent funding bill, he has largely been ineffectual.\n\nAnyone active on social media has seen a Democratic electorate enraged at Schumer and the other Senate Democrats who joined him in voting to advance the budget bill. In fairness to Schumer and these other senators, they argue that as bad as the bill was, a government shutdown would have done even more damage, especially since Trump and Musk could use the opportunity to eviscerate key agencies and shove thousands more government workers out the door. One might disagree with this view - and with Schumer's messaging strategy - but it isn't a crazy position to take.\n\nNevertheless, voters in the Democratic base are clearly hungry for representatives who will not only find the most pragmatic ways to counter Trump, but who will oppose him loudly and without embarrassment. That's why figures such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Jasmine Crockett (D-Tex.) are commanding ever-larger followings as Democrats who seem to grasp the urgency of both the moment and their voters' emotions.\n\nThat desire for fighting spirit is reflected in the polls. When NBC's poll asked at the beginning of Trump's first term whether Democratic voters wanted representatives who would \"make compromises with President Trump to gain consensus on legislation\" or \"stick to their positions even if this means not getting things done in Washington,\" they favored compromise by a 59-33 margin. Today, the numbers have flipped: Democratic voters now favor fighting, 65-32.\n\nSome Democrats in Congress would protest that without formal institutional power, there's only so much they can do to thwart the president. That was the dilemma Republicans found themselves in during Barack Obama's presidency. Even GOP voters considered Republican lawmakers feckless and weak, so they voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act an astonishing 70 times ( depending on how you count ).\n\nA base that has decided it can't rely on leadership will start organizing for itself.\n\nIn the end, the repeal votes became a symbol of Republican impotence rather than resistance. Speaker of the House John Boehner was hounded from office in 2015 by tea party activists who considered him too weak to lead the fight against a president they despised. And Obama comfortably beat Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election.\n\nBut look what else happened. Republicans took back the House, then the Senate and eventually the White House. They won sweeping gains at the state level: Democrats lost a net of 948 seats in state legislatures while Obama was president, the most a party had lost since Herbert Hoover was president, and 19 states saw chambers flip to Republican control.\n\nHow could that have happened while the national GOP looked so hapless? Ironically, the the national party's poor standing may have helped spur its gains. That's because an angry base is a motivated base, and a base that has decided it can't rely on leadership will start organizing for itself.\n\nThat appears to be exactly what is beginning to happen now. Grassroots Democrats are organizing protests . Bernie Sanders is drawing crowds to his \"Stopping Oligarchy\" tour. The progressive group Run For Something, which helps liberals run for state and local offices, says it has signed up almost as many prospective candidates just since Trump's inauguration as it did in all of 2017 and 2018. And activists are advocating primary challenges against Democratic leaders, just as tea partiers did to Republican leaders a decade ago.\n\nThat experience was uncomfortable for those running the party, but it showed that the party's base was riled up and mad. And if some of Democrats' anger is directed at their own leaders, that might be the most encouraging sign of a revival not just for the party's institutions but its broader fortunes.\n\nPaul Waldman is a journalist and author whose writing has appeared in dozens of publications.

Senators at the time did not have the full transcript of the group chat in which top officials inadvertently shared military secrets with a journalist hours before the United States carried out bombings in Yemen.\n\nSo the senators weren't in much of a position to scrutinize the claims - made by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, who were part of that group chat (along with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and national security adviser Mike Waltz) - that none of the information exchanged in the chat was classified. (A claim that has been echoed by the White House.)\n\nBut then The Atlantic published the contents of that Signal chat Wednesday morning, ahead of a similar hearing in the House. And that information gave Democrats the opportunity to press intelligence officials, again including Gabbard and Ratcliffe, on the security failure and to call for Hegseth's resignation.\n\n\"A lot of this suggests sort of a lack of sobriety,\" Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut said of Hegseth's use of emojis in several of his posts to the chat. \"When there's punch emojis and fire emojis, it's a lack of sobriety. I don't mean that literally.\" (Himes' aside at the end is an apparent jab at Hegseth's alleged history of alcohol abuse, which the secretary has denied .)\n\nElsewhere, in response to questions about whether classified material was in the chat, Hegseth told reporters , \"Nobody's texting war plans, and that's all I have to say.\"\n\nSen. Tammy Duckworth's social media post was typical of the Democratic response to that:\n\nIn demanding Hegseth's resignation, House Democrats at the hearing pointed to his Signal messages to highlight the sensitivity of the military plans he was discussing on a commercial messaging platform.\n\nRep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., sounded exasperated as he tried to get Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, to say the details Hegseth shared were classified. \"This is classified information,\" the representative interjected after Kruse attempted to deflect. Krishnamoorthi said Hegseth \"needs to resign immediately and a full investigation needs to be undertaken with regard to whether other Signal chats are occurring in this administration.\"\n\nWatch below:\n\nRep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., brought in a large printout of Hegseth's messages to prove the secretary was discussing details of an imminent attack by the U.S. Crow also showed images of anti-aircraft missiles the Houthis have at their disposal to illustrate the risks to U.S. military personnel if the information discussed in the group chat had fallen into the hands of America's adversaries.\n\n\"Nobody is willing to come to us and say, 'This was wrong, this was a breach of security, and we won't do it again,'\" Crow said. \"It is outrageous and it is a leadership failure, and that is why Secretary Hegseth - who undoubtedly transmitted classified, sensitive operational information via this chain - must resign immediately.\"\n\nWatch Crow's line of questioning here:\n\nJa'han Jones is an MSNBC opinion blogger.

And when is it time to use every possible democratic means to slow his assault?\n\nThis is how democracies end. When independent voices of authority are purged and a pluralistic civil society is fractured.\n\nOn Tuesday, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer joined \"All In.\" The interview was clarifying in many ways, but one of my main takeaways is that there is a fundamental difference between how some people view this moment.\n\nSome people think we are in a constitutional crisis - that there is a plan in place to impose a dictatorship in the United States. On Tuesday's show, Schumer told me he was not quite ready to declare a constitutional crisis yet. Now, I truly hope Schumer is right, but it makes it very hard to imagine a leader \"meeting the moment\" if they don't believe the moment is even here.\n\nFor me, Trump's intentions are so clear. He is in the process of attempting to undo the constitutional republic. His executive branch is in the process of overtaking the legislative and judicial branches of government, Congress and the courts, so that he gets to act unilaterally.\n\nEven within his executive purview, this president is purging anything and anyone who falls short of pledging unshakable loyalty to him and his political project. From the FBI to the Justice Department to the Federal Trade Commission , these institutions are being cleared of career officials who may favor the rule of law over Trump's whims, and they are being replaced with loyalists.\n\nAs The New York Times reported , Trump is using the vast powers of the presidency to hobble his political opponents, including bogus investigations into Democratic fundraising platforms and threats to shut down nonprofit organizations he sees as oppositional.\n\nBut it's not just the government or partisan entities. Trump wants to dismantle all forms of public opposition to his power grab, starting with all sources of independent authority. Any institution with credibility must either be bent to Trump's will or destroyed.\n\nHe has repeatedly threatened independent media outlets, including this one , for coverage he deems to be insufficiently fawning. He is conducting an unprecedented attack on American higher education, including freezing $175 million in federal funding for his alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania. And he is seemingly openly defying the Constitution as he tries to deport a legal resident over his protected political speech.\n\nThis is how democracies end - when independent voices of authority are purged and a pluralistic civil society is fractured. It is clear as day to so many of us, including scholars of authoritarian regimes and especially folks who have lived through those regimes.\n\nI think part of the issue, which is a legitimate concern, is how we got to this point. There is a sense among Democrats - one that is not totally wrong - that democracy is not a particularly salient political issue. Democrats spent the entire 2024 election cycle hammering their messaging about the threats to democracy and civil society, but voters were more concerned with pocketbook issues , like the cost of living. Therefore, some Democrats think democracy is a losing issue politically and that we should talk about Medicaid cuts or the effect of Trump's trade war on the economy.\n\nI understand the instinct to stick to these kitchen-table issues. I don't think it is necessarily the wrong lesson to have learned from the election. But the terrain has shifted too much since November. Democrats should not be fighting the last war. While that type of resistance worked eight years ago, now is not the time for politics as usual. This is a break-glass moment.\n\n'This moment requires us to break norms; this moment requires us to take risks,' Sen. Chris Murphy told Jon Stewart on Monday.\n\nFirst of all, Trump is already underwater on questions about the economy. The state of the stock market is doing a pretty good job messaging pocketbook issues all on its own. But more importantly: Democrats don't have to choose. It's all one thing. The threat to democracy has become so much more tangible than it was when folks went to the ballot four months ago, in part because Trump's entire mad king act is wreaking havoc in every direction.\n\nWith that in mind, a lot of Schumer's Democratic colleagues believe it's time to fight back harder, as Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut has been out there saying.\n\n\"This moment requires us to break norms; this moment requires us to take risks,\" Murphy told Jon Stewart on Monday . \"And I get it. A lot of my colleagues said shutting down the government, being in a government shutdown, that's a risk; that hands power to Donald Trump and Elon Musk. But how on Earth are we going to ask the American people to take risks for us, right, when there's a five-alarm constitutional fire and we need them to be out on the streets - not with hundreds, not with thousands or tens of thousands of people, but with hundreds of thousands of people - if we're not willing to take risks ourselves?\"\n\nNow is the time to take political risks - before it is too late. Not to oversimplify, but the whole point of America is that you cannot have one guy in charge of everything, without checks or balances. That is literally the foundational insight upon which the country was built. No kings. Not ever. There is quite possibly nothing that is more fundamentally American.\n\nChris Hayes hosts \"All In with Chris Hayes\" at 8 p.m. ET Tuesday through Friday on MSNBC.

Below is an adapted excerpt from the March 3 episode featuring former Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio.\n\nWhen I reflect on November's election, two glaring omissions are missing from the Democratic Party's messaging: acknowledgment and empathy. The lesson Democrats should take away from Kamala Harris' loss to Donald Trump is the importance of meeting people where they are emotionally . If Democrats don't do that, their message isn't going to stick.\n\nJust consider my home state of Ohio. Over the years, deindustrialization, globalization and automation have just compounded, leaving many Ohioans in a tough spot . What I wish the Democratic Party would have said to these voters is simple: \"I know you're hurting but it's going to take a little time for us to right this ship.\"\n\nIt's time to start building the case for the American people. But that doesn't mean Democrats should run around with hair on fire over every issue.\n\nThe country just went through a pandemic. Disinvestment and deindustrialization decimated entire communities. Democrats know that - that's why they've passed massive bills and implemented policy to try to help, investing in infrastructure, chip manufacturing, wind and solar energy, batteries and electric vehicles.\n\nBut the Democratic Party also needs to be honest with the American people. There's no quick solution here. There's going to be a lot of bumps along the way so Democrats should tell voters, \"We're sorry but we're going to do this as quickly as we can.\"\n\nThat's a message I believe Joe Biden could have successfully communicated to voters. When he was still the party's nominee, I wish he could have just said to the American people: \"Hang with me. Trust me. I've lived in communities like yours. I've seen this before. It's going to take a while to fix but just give me a chance.\"\n\nDemocrats should have acknowledged the tough spot a lot of Americans were in. They should have shown voters they're empathetic. But we also can't just look in the past and talk about what the Democratic Party should have done. Democrats in Congress have a real opportunity to right that ship and show voters what the party really stands for.\n\nThere's an analog element to this, members should be holding town hall meetings as often as they can. They need to get on the local news. It's time to start building the case for the American people. But that doesn't mean Democrats should run around with hair on fire over every issue.\n\nConsider the Trump administration's recent cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development. During my time in Congress, I voted on foreign aid. I sat on the Defense Appropriation Subcommittee. I know the value of those programs and how they save the U.S. money in the long run. But I don't think Democrats want the discussion to be about how they're defending foreign aid while people in their districts are still trying to figure out how to make ends meet and buy a carton of eggs. Why take the bait on that? Haven't Democrats learned?\n\nDemocrats don't want the discussion to be about how they're defending foreign aid while people in their districts are still trying to figure out how to make ends meet.\n\nMy advice for Democrats is just that: Don't take the bait on everything coming out of this White House. Sometimes the smartest strategy is just to play possum. As Democratic strategist James Carville recently suggested in a guest essay for the New York Times, maybe the most daring political maneuver Democrats could implement right now is to \"roll over and play dead.\"\n\nJust let people see what the Trump administration is doing, uninterrupted. Then Democrats can point and say, \"Wait, Trump didn't say he would do that during the campaign. Trump said he would fix the economy. So why is he so focused on Ukraine? Why is he proposing tax breaks for billionaires?\"\n\nOnce voters start seeing that and feeling the impact of Trump's policies - like a mother who lost her child care because of budget cuts - they will start to realize he's not delivering on his promises. That's when Democrats can acknowledge, empathize and recapture the narrative to show the American people what their party truly stands for.\n\nTim Ryan served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2003 to 2023.

By lunchtime, the party's plan had to be thrown out the window in order to address an unexpected White House's latest national security scandal.\n\nThe basic elements of the controversy are probably familiar. Top members of Donald Trump's national security team chatted in a Signal group over the classified details of a military strike in Yemen, and they accidentally included Jeffrey Goldberg, The Atlantic's editor in chief.\n\nThose hoping to see Democrats take the controversy seriously didn't have to wait long. The Washington Post reported :\n\nCongressional Democrats on Monday called for investigations over the leak of highly sensitive military plans involving top Cabinet officials and the editor in chief of The Atlantic. ... While the White House admitted that officials had made a mistake in adding Goldberg to the chat, Democrats in Congress argued that the acknowledgment isn't enough and that the error must be investigated.\n\n\"The leak of sensitive national security information by the Trump administration on a non-classified system is completely outrageous and shocks the conscience,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a statement. \"It is yet another unprecedented example that our nation is increasingly more dangerous because of the elevation of reckless and mediocre individuals, including the Secretary of Defense.\"\n\nThe New York Democrat added, \"If House Republicans are truly serious about keeping America safe, and not simply being sycophants and enablers, they must join Democrats in a swift, serious and substantive investigation into this unacceptable and irresponsible national security breach.\"\n\nAround the same time, on the other side of Capitol Hill, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer delivered floor remarks in which the New York Democrat said, \"This debacle requires a full investigation into how this happened, the damage it created, and how we can avoid it in the future. If our nation's military secrets are being peddled around over unsecure text chains, we need to know at once and we need to put a stop to it immediately. Every single Senator - Republican and Democrat and Independent - must demand accountability.\"\n\nSchumer added, \"This kind of carelessness is how people get killed. It is how our enemies take advantage of us. It is how our national security falls into danger.\"\n\nSen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, said the scandal \"represents one of the most egregious failures of operational security and common sense I have ever seen.\" Rep. Don Beyer of Virginia added via Bluesky , \"Heads must roll. This is one of the dumbest security breaches in history, and it suggests a larger pattern of potentially criminal behavior that puts Americans at risk.\"\n\nThere are 260 Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill, and it's impractical to think that I can quote all of them in this blog post. Suffice it to say, most of them had exceedingly critical reactions to the blockbuster reporting.\n\nThe next question, of course, is what they'll do next.\n\nBecause Democrats are in the minority, they can't call committee hearings or send subpoenas to the Trump administration. That said, members can launch investigations - several Democrats have already indicated their examinations are already underway - and issue reports.\n\nThey can also ask good questions during congressional hearings, including a Senate hearing that's poised to begin with testimony from Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe.\n\nFinally, they can at least try to organize unofficial hearings. \"Only one word for this: FUBAR,\" Democratic Rep. Pat Ryan of New York, an Army veteran who sits on the Armed Services Committee, wrote online . \"If House Republicans won't hold a hearing on how this happened IMMEDIATELY, I'll do it my damn self.\"\n\nSteve Benen is a producer for \"The Rachel Maddow Show,\" the editor of MaddowBlog and an MSNBC political contributor.

With this in mind, a special election just outside of Pittsburgh drew quite a bit of attention, since it would tip the scales.\n\nThe result wasn't especially close: Democrat Dan Goughnour - a retired police officer, Teamster and local school board member - easily prevailed , restoring the party's narrow majority in the state legislative chamber.\n\nBut it was the results of the other special election in the Keystone State that will raise eyebrows far outside Pennsylvania. The Hill reported :\n\nDemocrat James Malone has won an open Pennsylvania state Senate seat in a major upset in a district that comfortably voted for President Trump in November, Decision Desk HQ projects. Malone, the mayor of East Petersburg, is projected to defeat Republican Lancaster County Commissioner Josh Parsons to represent Senate District 36 for the remainder of former state Sen. Ryan Aument's (R) term.\n\nAnytime a party manages to flip a district, it tends to generate some attention, but the closer one looks at this contest, the more dramatic the results appear: This is a district that Donald Trump carried by 15 points last fall.\n\nWhat's more, as an analysis in The Downballot noted, \"Since taking its present form in Lancaster County 40 years ago, the district has always been held by the GOP, and the county as a whole has gone for a Democrat at the presidential level just once since 1856 (Lyndon Johnson just barely won it in 1964).\"\n\nThis is not, in other words, a district where a Democrat is supposed to be competitive. And yet Malone prevailed by running on a notable platform. From The Downballot's analysis: \"Malone focused his message heavily on education and cuts to the federal government that he's had to deal with as mayor of a small town, specifically calling out Musk for slashing 'benefits for veterans, retirees, and students.'\"\n\nThese results come just eight weeks after a Democrat in Minnesota won a state legislative special election , giving the party a majority in the state Senate, which coincided with a state Senate special election in Iowa in which Democrat Mike Zimmer narrowly defeated his Republican rival.\n\nThe Iowa race generated some national coverage because of the broader circumstances: This special election was held in a district thought to be a GOP stronghold. Indeed, Trump won this district by 21 points. Then a Democratic candidate managed to flip the state Senate seat from red to blue anyway.\n\nThe Iowa and Minnesota contests came on the heels of a couple of closely watched state legislative special elections in Virginia, held a few weeks earlier, which Democrats also won . The contests were, as an NBC News report put it, \"an early test of the political environment.\"\n\nTo be sure, the news comes with some rather large caveats. Legislative special elections tend to be low-turnout affairs, and drawing sweeping conclusions about the meaning of their outcomes is unwise.\n\nThat said, in the aftermath of Election Day 2024, the conventional wisdom suggested not only that Republicans had entered an era of electoral dominance, but also that Democratic voters were demoralized, disheartened and prepared to withdraw from civic life for a while.\n\nSo it's notable that the party has put together some victories, undermining some of the assumptions from November.\n\nThe conventional wisdom will be put to the test again in just six days, with a closely watched state Supreme Court race in Wisconsin and two congressional special elections in Florida on tap for April 1. Watch this space.\n\nThis post updates our related earlier coverage .\n\nSteve Benen is a producer for \"The Rachel Maddow Show,\" the editor of MaddowBlog and an MSNBC political contributor.

Another vet fired from a job at the Veterans Administration . An architect who was restoring George Washington's office at Valley Forge, also fired. The mother of a child with cystic fibrosis who has benefited from medical research conducted at the National Institutes of Health . A patient terrified that Congress will cut the Medicaid that allows her to get treatment for her breast cancer.\n\nThese are some of the guests Democratic members of Congress are taking to President Donald Trump's address Tuesday night , people whose experiences tell a very different story from the one Trump wants to tell. For a change, Democrats are sending exactly the right message to the public, even if their megaphone isn't as large as Trump's: When you eviscerate the federal government, real people get hurt.\n\nTrump's speech will undoubtedly paint a picture of a transformed America, returned at last to its lost greatness. While this isn't technically a State of the Union address, it should encourage Democrats to remind voters of reality.\n\nThey need to point Americans to the objective facts and encourage them to take a good, hard look at what the actual state of our union is, especially as it has changed in the six weeks since Trump took office.\n\nThe mass firings of federal workers ordered by the Trump administration's Elon Musk-led ( but not officially ) \"Department of Government Efficiency\" have begun what will most likely be the largest single round of government layoffs in American history, creating the risk of touching off a recession as the impact of job losses spreads through communities around the country. Trump is also about to impose 25% tariffs on all imports from Canada and Mexico and increase tariffs on Chinese goods, which is almost certain to fuel more price increases. That may be part of the reason consumer confidence is dropping . And we all know how expensive eggs have gotten.\n\nThat's just the beginning.\n\nDemocrats also have an opportunity to be the party that stands in opposition to cutbacks that will make us all more vulnerable to corruption and abuse.\n\nDemocrats must take the opportunity to shine light on how Musk's rampage through federal agencies will most likely result in a degradation of both taxpayer-facing services and key government functions. The administration will be firing thousands of workers at the Social Security Administration and plans to close many of the offices that provide customer service to beneficiaries (Musk recently called the incredibly popular program a \"Ponzi scheme,\" an extraordinary gift to Democrats). As Americans start preparing their tax returns, thousands of workers at the IRS are also on the chopping block, most likely producing worse customer service and slower processing of returns.\n\nIn the heart of flu season and amid a deadly new measles outbreak, the Food and Drug Administration canceled its annual meeting to determine next year's flu vaccine, potentially damaging our response to the next round of infections. Warnings are coming in that the mass layoffs will threaten our ability to fight wildfires, prevent new epidemics and deliver basic services that millions of Americans rely on.\n\nDemocrats also have an opportunity to be the party that stands in opposition to cutbacks that will make us all more vulnerable to corruption and abuse.\n\nThe administration has dropped multiple cases against financial firms being investigated for misleading consumers and engaging in various kinds of misbehavior as part of its gutting of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, giving a green light to scammers everywhere to prey on people. The Department of Housing and Urban Development is preparing to cut off most of the funding for the enforcement of fair housing laws. Meanwhile, the Treasury Department has stopped enforcement of a rule meant to make it more difficult to launder money and set up phony shell companies, and it has all but shut down oversight of the crypto industry. What could go wrong?\n\nThen, Democrats should make the case to America that there's foreseeable long-term damage - which will become visible only over time.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health, the engine of America's world-leading medical research, has stopped issuing new grants and is in a general state of chaos . Internship programs in a wide variety of agencies that recruit talented young people to government service have been canceled . The administration is doing everything in its power to crush the development of renewable energy and increase carbon emissions, potentially worsening the effects of climate change. And Trump plans to cut the Environmental Protection Agency budget by 65%, the probable result of which will be dirtier air and water.\n\nIf that weren't enough, the government could shut down in less than two weeks.\n\nAs horrifying as all that may be, there's another, more hopeful story taking shape - and Democrats should be making Americans aware of it, as well.\n\nDemocrats should make the case to America that there's foreseeable long-term damage - which will become visible only over time.\n\nPeople are rising up to oppose what Trump and Musk are doing: Fired federal workers are organizing to educate the public about how the government serves them and what is being lost, demonstrators are assembling in national parks around the country to protest cuts to the National Park Service, constituents are flocking to town halls to express their anger at Republican representatives who support the brutal cuts to federal staff and services that the administration is carrying out.\n\nThere is a grassroots movement forming, and only some of it is coming from liberal activists; it also includes people who may have voted for Trump because they were mad about inflation and never thought he'd cut off disease research or fire their neighbors. Democrats should get behind that movement - and know that if they don't, they could face their own backlash from voters who want them to meet the moment.\n\nIt would be a mistake to think the damage from this effort to decimate the government won't be awful. But perhaps when it's over, more Americans will appreciate the value the federal workforce brings to all our lives. They may even learn that the military veterans who enjoy nearly universal esteem make up around 30% of federal workers, despite representing only 6% of the adult population (the federal government gives preference to veterans in hiring, a form of affirmative action even Republicans support).\n\nDemocrats have been slow to respond to the carnage happening around them, stunned by the sheer audacity of Trump's assault and unsure about what their message should be. But as they look around, they should see that people are not happy about the state of the union. Showing the public exactly who is being hurt by the destruction of government, which Trump's address has given them the chance to do, is a good place to start.\n\nPaul Waldman is a journalist and author whose writing has appeared in dozens of publications.

      "text": "The Democrats Are in Denial About 2024\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nThe Editorial Board\n\nBy The Editorial Board\n\nThe editorial board is a group of opinion journalists whose views are informed by expertise, research, debate and certain longstanding values . It is separate from the newsroom.\n\nLast year's election was close, despite President Trump's hyperbolic claims about his margin of victory. Still, the Democratic Party clearly lost - and not only the presidential race. It also lost control of the Senate and failed to recapture the House of Representatives. Of the 11 governor's races held last year, Democrats won three. In state legislature races, they won fewer than 45 percent of the seats.\n\nIn the aftermath of this comprehensive defeat, many party leaders have decided that they do not need to make significant changes to their policies or their message. They have instead settled on a convenient explanation for their plight.\n\nThat explanation starts with the notion that Democrats were merely the unlucky victims of postpandemic inflation and that their party is more popular than it seems: If Democrats could only communicate better, particularly on social media and podcasts, the party would be fine. \"We've got the right message,\" Ken Martin, the new chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said while campaigning for the job . \"What we need to do is connect it back with the voters.\"\n\nA key part of this argument involves voter turnout. Party leaders claim that most Americans still prefer Democrats but that voter apathy allowed Mr. Trump to win. According to this logic, Democrats do not need to worry about winning back Trump voters and should instead try to animate the country's natural liberal majority. \"I don't think we're going to win over those 77 million that voted for Donald Trump,\" Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, the party's 2024 vice-presidential nominee, said this month . \"I'm concerned with the 90 million who stayed home.\" It was an unfortunate echo of Hillary Clinton saying that millions of Trump voters were \"deplorables\" and \"irredeemable.\"\n\nAs comforting as these explanations may feel to Democrats, they are a form of denial that will make it harder for the Democratic Party to win future elections.\n\nEven many conservatives and Republicans should be concerned about the Democratic denial. The country needs two healthy political parties. It especially needs a healthy Democratic Party, given Mr. Trump's takeover of the Republican Party and his draconian behavior. Restraining him - and any successors who continue his policies - depends on Democrats' taking an honest look at their problems.\n\nShare of respondents who said they felt somewhat or very positive about the Democratic Party\n\n50%\n\n40\n\n30\n\n27%\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n1995\n\n2005\n\n2015\n\n2025\n\n50%\n\n40\n\n30\n\n27%\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n1995\n\n2000\n\n2005\n\n2010\n\n2015\n\n2020\n\n2025\n\nNote: Some polls reached only registered voters.\n\nSources: Hart Research; NBC News\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Gavin Newsom of California said on Friday that the Democratic brand was \"toxic\" and that his party had to admit its own mistakes, delivering tough love as Democrats struggle in their fight against the Trump administration.\n\nMr. Newsom, once considered a liberal combatant, has embarked on a political soul search in the months since President Trump won the White House and Republicans won both houses of Congress. On Friday, he used his strongest language yet to criticize his own party during an appearance on \"Real Time With Bill Maher.\"\n\n\"The Democratic brand is toxic right now,\" he said, pointing to a recent NBC News poll that showed Democrats with a 27 percent favorability rating, the lowest in at least a generation.\n\nMr. Newsom, a possible 2028 presidential candidate, blamed his fellow Democrats for his party's woes. He criticized Democrats for being judgmental, staying in an echo chamber and resorting to \"cancel culture\" to ostracize people whose views they find abhorrent.\n\n\"We talk down to people,\" he said. \"We talk past people.\"\n\nThe governor found in Mr. Maher a sympathetic figure who for decades has questioned Democratic orthodoxy despite his liberal leanings.\n\nMr. Newsom this month launched a new podcast, \"This Is Gavin Newsom,\" on which he has interviewed guests from across the political spectrum to discuss, in part, what went wrong for Democrats in the 2024 elections.

Gessen, Nicholas Kristof and Zeynep Tufekci\n\nBy Jamelle Bouie M. Gessen Nicholas Kristof and Zeynep Tufekci\n\nMr. Bouie, Mx. Gessen, Mr. Kristof and Ms. Tufekci are Opinion columnists.\n\n Patrick Healy, the deputy Opinion editor, hosted an online conversation with four Times Opinion columnists about how anger at President Trump can be harnessed into effective opposition and why Democratic Party leaders are struggling to do it.\n\nPatrick Healy: In my job I hear a lot from readers. Over the last few weeks I've received some of the angriest and most despairing emails and phone calls of my career, from people saying President Trump is systematically degrading and destroying the United States. They wonder if there will be fair elections in 2026 or 2028. They're furious this week about the Signal group chat on national security and war planning. But they're also angry because they feel there's no effective opposition to Trump, be it from Democratic elected officials or the party, the legal system, universities or other institutions.\n\nMany Americans feel in real peril. They don't want to wait out Trump or keep their heads down. They want to fight for their country. So my first question to you is: Why has fighting and opposing Trump proved so hard? Is it simply that Republicans hold all the cards in government? That can't be the only reason - this anger is palpable in part because a lot of Americans believe something can be done.\n\nJamelle Bouie: Patrick, I think your initial question can be broken into two separate ones. The first: Is fighting and resisting Trump difficult to do? The second: Why have Democrats struggled to do either?\n\nI do not think it is particularly difficult to fight Trump. Democrats could have, from the jump, assumed a posture of total and unrelenting opposition. They would not have been able to stop most of the president's actions - that is the consequence of losing control of Congress - but they would have made clear the radicalism of the administration and, more importantly, they would have sent a signal to ordinary Democratic voters that there's no need to give the president the benefit of the doubt.\n\nHealy: And many voters have been hungry for what you're suggesting, Jamelle. Why have Democrats struggled to do that?\n\nMost American don't really care if the country is authoritarian. Democrats will not have a chance until conditions become too painful for more Americans.\n\n@Marque Tres Sadly, I think you are right when you say that most people don't care. As we say in Russian, people prefer not to engage with politics until politics engages with them. But waiting for things to get worse in the hopes that that will shake people out of their apathy is not only dangerous but misguided. In many cases, the harder life is, the less likely people are to care about anything but daily survival. The question has to be: How do you break through indifference now? I don't think that can be accomplished solely by focusing on how destructive the Trump administration is. I think a vision is necessary.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

You may have noticed that it's been a while since my last newsletter . That's because I've been on leave for the last three months - and I'll be on leave for most of the next three - but I wanted to check in with a few thoughts and programming notes.\n\nSince a few of you asked: Yes, The Tilt goes on. The newsletter will ramp back up as I return to work, and needless to say, there is a lot to cover. This is not an ordinary moment in American political history.\n\nHere are a few themes on my mind so far:\n\nFrom the usual job approval surveys to more profound issues regarding executive power, attitudes about President Trump will probably be the topic of the year.\n\nTo that end, my colleagues have already started collecting polls on his approval rating (we'll add charts with the polling average in the weeks ahead).\n\nAlready, Mr. Trump has squandered his post-election honeymoon. His approval rating is back under 50 percent, with slightly more Americans disapproving than approving of his performance. This puts his standing more or less where it was before the election.\n\nThere are good reasons to think his ratings will continue to slip. One of the better rules of thumb in American politics is that public opinion tends to shift against the direction of policy change. Some political scientists call this \"thermostatic public opinion,\" in which the public turns up the A.C. to cool things down when the government starts running too hot. Few presidents have run the government as hot as Mr. Trump, and there isn't much reason to think he'll turn anything down on his own.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

It wasn't clear how they planned to do so.\n\nBy Annie Karni\n\nA number of frustrated House Democrats who said their party had a \"weak and undefined brand\" announced on Tuesday that they were seeking to form a new group to dig out of their crisis, informally referred to as the New Economic Patriots.\n\nThe group is the brainchild of Representative Chris Deluzio, a 40-year-old second-term congressman from a competitive district in Pennsylvania, who criticized members of his own party as wimps in a speech on the House floor on Tuesday and called for Democrats to channel a \"fighting spirit of economic populism\" that he argued could lead them out of the political wilderness.\n\n\"Too many in our party have lost their way and it's time to wake the heck up,\" Mr. Deluzio said, later declaring: \"The era of a spineless Democratic Party must end.\"\n\nThe answer, he said, was for the party to focus on appealing to working people on economic issues, but it was not immediately clear how his plan was different from what many in the party have already been advocating. Still, Mr. Deluzio's effort is the latest sign that Democrats, relegated to the minority in Washington and desperate to find a more coherent message after their devastating 2024 losses, are still mired in a politically fraught debate about how to move forward.\n\nMr. Deluzio has highlighted his status as a young lawmaker who outperformed former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election in a critical district in a key battleground state as he makes the case for why he is the right person to help lead his party out of its funk.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Deluzio said the \"progressive\" and \"moderate\" labels did not work anymore given that his entire tattered party needed to be restructured around an economic populist message that he said had been co-opted by the right.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "Democrats Need to Face Why Trump Won\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nThe Ezra Klein Show\n\nBy Ezra Klein\n\ntranscript\n\nI've been spending some time recently with top Democrats, as they think about how to rebuild after the 2024 loss. And I'll say that in some years I've been covering politics, I have never heard them so confused. America is back. How could they possibly lost this election to this person. Also, how is the Democratic Party weakening. So much among groups whose strength, whose support it once took for granted. Young voters. Non-white voters. Working class voters. What does it mean that the Democratic Party is losing what was once its base, its reliable base. Someone whose analysis on this have come to respect over the years is David Shor. David Shor is the head of data science at blowers research, which is a big Democratic consulting firm. So first, this is a big table of numbers. It does a huge amount of political surveying and interpretation of data and testing of messaging. And he's gotten a lot of things right before other people did, including that educational polarization was becoming the central fault line for American democracy. And so when I saw Shor recently and he began walking me through some of his slides, some of the ways he was interpreting the 2024 election and trying to help people see what had happened. My first thought was this would be worth doing in public, rather than this being a thing that Democrats are debating in Backrooms with each other. What if we did this in public. And so this episode is a bit of an experiment. He's walking me through this presentation and I am interrogating it. But I found this really, really helpful. I don't necessarily have every conclusion, David does, but I think it is a good place to begin. And there's then a lot that can follow from having this conversation. As always, my email at nytimes.com. David Shor, welcome to the show. Excited to be here. So what do you do. And why should I trust the data you're about to show us here. I'm glad. I'm glad you asked. I'm the co-founder of a research firm called blue rose research. We did 26 million interviews last year, and we have a team of about 45 people, machine learning engineers, software engineers from companies like Google. And, we've done a lot of work to try to figure out what actually happened last year. A lot of liberals I feel really burnt by survey data. There's a sense that nobody picks up the phone. How are you surveying these older people if you're doing it online. Putting aside the fact that you conducted a lot of surveys, why are you confident those surveys reflect reality. The fundamental problem with survey research is just that people who answer surveys are really weird. There's two ways that you can try to fix that. One is that you could try to get a normal representative set of people. That's just impossible in today's day and age. And the other is that you can just try to collect a lot of information so that you can adjust for how weird they are. The reason I feel fairly confident about this is just in our work, every time we make any change to any part of our system, we go back and back, test and see how it affects accuracy across every other election that we've ever surveyed. We can't be fully confident about any particular thing that we say. A lot of the data isn't back yet, but I think that there's enough data to tell a coherent story. There's the 26 million survey respondents of 8 million unique people. There's precinct and County level election results. We're also going to try to tie together all of the external data that other people have done. And what I'll say about this election is that our forecast. This cycle were very accurate. Our overall error was about 1/3 of a percent nationally. And I think that a lot most of the things that we thought would happen. Did bear out. And I do want to spend a second to answer, something that you had asked a second ago, which is just like, why look at survey data. I think that Super politically engaged people are overrepresented at every single step of the political process. They're more likely to run for office. They're more likely to work in campaigns and journalism. They're more likely to listen to podcasts like this one. And I think that they're really the only point other than election day, when regular people get a say is in polls. And so I think there isn't really any Democratic alternative to trying to listen to the people and hear what they have to say. So I take that point. I always think it is good to remind me and everybody who listens to the show that they are weird. And if their intuitions about politics were shared, politics would not look the way it does at all. Right If the voting population were, show listeners and people they then elections end up very differently. So I take your point on survey data. So where do we begin. All right. So first I'm just going to start with this slide over here that just looks at support for the Democratic presidential candidate in 2016 and 2020 and 2024 by race and ideology. In 2016, Democrats got 81 percent of Hispanic moderates, and in 2024, Democrats got 58 percent of Hispanic moderates. That's only about 7 percent more than the 52 percent that they got of white moderates. The main story with respect to this is just a continuation of the trends that we saw four years ago. Throughout the entire Trump campaign, we've seen this racial polarization. The thing I find most surprising here is you look at white voters liberal, moderate and conservative. And at least in this data from 2016 to 2024, there is a 0 percent swing in any of them, because there are all these things that if you go back to the debates we were having about Donald Trump, then it is the return and resurgence of a coalition trying to protect white power in this country. And I wrote things about this. I think there was good reason to believe that even if that was part of the intention, then that does not appear in the results. So the Democrats lose modest amount of support among Black voters in those years. They lose a huge amount of support among Hispanic voters and a significant amount among Asian voters. Why do you think that is. I think that a lot of political analysis in America has been really centered around viewing everything through a very America centric lens, because there's this story in American politics. If you want to understand 20th century American politics, then the big story is that there was this giant Southern realignment in 1964, driven by the Civil Rights Act, driven by the Civil Rights Act, and that carried forward. It took a really long time for that to really work its way through downballot. And so I think it was really tempting for American political scientists and a lot. The more detail oriented American political pundits to just kind of see everything. People who wrote books like why were polarized, for instance. Yeah, exactly just to see everything through this transformation. Thomas Piketty actually recently wrote a great book about this thing I'm about to talk about. But I think the most important trend politically of the last 30 to 40 years, both here and in every other country in the world, at least Western country that has elections has been the story of education, polarization. That basically everywhere we've seen highly educated people move to the left and working class people move to the right. I think a lot of people's analytical error when looking at Trump is that they saw Trump as this kind of reincarnation of the 1960s of like George Wallace or something, when really I think he was representing this global trend. You could look at a bunch of other countries. You have Marine Le Pen in France, you have the AFD in Germany. And I think that people miss that. There was kind of a broader global appeal, this kind of polarization on values. The other thing that I find interesting here is the shift in voters who self-describe as conservative, right. There's no shift in white, self-described conservative voters between 2016 and 2024, but Democrats are winning 85 percent of Black conservatives in 2016, but only 77 percent in 2024. They're winning 34 percent of conservative Hispanics in 2016. That falls by half to 17 percent in 2024. They're winning 28 percent of conservative Asians in 2016. That falls to 20 percent in 2024. So it's always a little bit weird for somebody who is self-described conservative to be voting for Democrats who are quite a Liberal Party now. But what we're seeing among nonwhite voters is people voting more their ideology and less their ethnic group. That's exactly right. And I would just say, I think this shouldn't be that surprising. I think now, we identify the Democratic Party as straightforwardly liberal. The Democratic Party used to be a coalition between liberals and moderates and conservatives. And as liberals kind of became the dominant coalition partner. It makes sense, that the conservatives and moderates in our coalition, who were disproportionately nonwhite, given that this ideological polarization happened among whites 20 years ago or 30 years ago, that you would start to see this. All right. Let's move to slide two here. All right. But there were some new trends this cycle. So I can hear you going to presentation voice. Yeah great. Great, great. You're good. So this slide over here has what I think is probably the most important story of this cycle. So I have two graphs over here. The first breaks down 2020 for support by whether or not you had voted in 2020. And so this is New York Times' data from Nate Cohen's upshot polling, probably the highest quality public pollster in America. And what you can see here is just that in 2020, in their data, people who didn't vote if they had voted would have been a little bit more Democratic than the country overall. But over the next four years, people who didn't vote went from being a somewhat Democratic leaning group to a group that Trump won by double digits. So the second graph here, we have for every precinct, we look at what percentage of people voted in 2022. And then we just look at what was the change in Democratic vote share from 2020 to 2024. And so what you can see here is that for the lowest turnout precincts, Trump increased his vote share by something like 6 percent While for the highest turnout precincts, Harris actually increased her support. And that's really the story of this election is that people who follow news really closely, who get their news from traditional media, who say that politics is an important part of their identity. They became more Democratic in absolute terms. But for people who don't follow politics closely at all, they just became a lot more Republican. It's interesting because I obviously get a lot of incoming from people who would like the New York Times' to cover Donald Trump differently. And some of those arguments I agree with, some of them I don't. That's what I always think about with that, though, is that if your lever is New York Times' headlines, you're not affecting the voters you are losing. And the question Democrats are facing. When you look at how badly they lost less politically engaged voters is, how do you change the views of voters. You don't really have a good way to reach. Yeah, and I mean, that's 100 percent And, I just want to stress that this is a new problem. This problem didn't exist four years ago. And it's not just that New York Times' readers are more liberal than the overall population. That's definitely true. It's that they're more liberal than they were four years ago, even though the country went the other way. And so there's this great political divergence between people who consume all the news sources that we know about and read about versus the people who don't. And so, as a result of these changes, we're really this is really reversed, a decades long truism in American politics where for the longest time, Democrats have said, and it's been true, that if everybody votes, we win. And that higher turnout is good for Democrats, and this is the first cycle where that definitively became the opposite of true. Here I just have some numbers. If only people who had voted in 2022 had voted, Harris would have won the popular vote and also the electoral college fairly easily. While if everyone had voted, Trump would have won the popular vote by nearly 5 points. Generally, what you see now is that every measure of socioeconomic status and political engagement is just monotonically related to your chance of liking Trump. What is monotonically related. Yeah sorry. Just that this is why Democrats can't win. That's exactly right. I'm the problem. But it's basically just that the more even the lowest political engagement categories, the lowest education categories, the poorer the lower socioeconomic status, the less engaged you are in politics now, the more Trumpy you are. And that just wasn't true four years ago. So here here's something that I've heard from a lot of Democrats and very good election analysts, which seems to be in some tension here. There is an argument that what happened to Democrats between 2020 and 2024 is their voters stayed home. And so what happened here was a shrinking of the electorate that disproportionately sliced off what Democrats for a while were calling the anti MAGA coalition. How does that idea that Democrats didn't lose to Trump, they lost to the couch set with you. It's just not empirically correct. I would say generally turnout and support go in the same direction for the basic reason that there are a lot of people who didn't feel ready to vote for a Republican but were still mad at the Democratic Party, and so they stayed home in response. And if you just look at the demographics of who these people are, who voted for Biden last time and stayed home this time, they're generally low education. They're fairly politically disengaged. They're much less likely to watch shows like MSNBC and more likely to watch shows like Fox, and they frankly just look a lot like the voters who trended away from us. So if you had forced them out to vote, they may have just voted for Donald Trump. Exactly And that does show up. If you look at African-Americans, for example, African-Americans who didn't vote were much more likely to say that they supported Trump than the ones that did this cycle. It's true that overall turnout fell in a lot of the country, but in the battleground states that actually decided the presidential election, turnout was roughly where it was from four years ago. And it just is clear as day that a bunch of people changed their mind. How much is this just inflation. You are dealing with people who they're not paying a lot of attention to politics. They do pay attention and feel prices and the state of the country. You had a massive inflationary period and they're pissed and being pissed about inflation. Move them against the incumbent party, which they held responsible in this country, as in other countries, for inflation. I think that that's a very reasonable explanation. It makes sense that the people who care the least about politics are going to be the most mad about prices going up, and there's a lot of academic reasons to think that makes sense. I'm not making any claims, per se, about why this happened, though I think inflation makes sense. If you actually poll these non-voters and ask them what did they care the most about they'll tell you inflation. I'll get to this later. But that's what every single subgroup of the electorate cared the most about by overwhelming margins. And so I don't think it's necessarily true that it's impossible for us to win those voters back. But, I'll talk about this later. There have been dramatic shifts in the media consumption habits of these people in the last four years. And so it may be a harder problem. Before you discuss, I think it's worth talking to the next chart, too, because it's getting at the same question in a different way. So here, we have a plot that we just took from The Economist. And in the bottom, we just have foreign born population and on the top we just have increase in Republican vote share. And what you could see is there's a very clear correlation. This is by County. This is by County. There's a very clear correlation between how many immigrants there were in a County and how much it increased by Donald Trump, towards Trump. You can see in counties like Queens, New York or miami-dade and Florida. Trump increased his vote share percentage by 10 percentage points, which is just crazy. And so when we go and we look at the precinct election results, what we see is that in immigrant communities of all races, our best guess is that immigrants went from being a Biden plus 27 group in 2020 to a group that Trump narrowly won in 2024. This group, of naturalized citizens is roughly 10 percent of the electorate. So that means that immigrants swung much, much, much more than the median of the electorate. That's exactly right. Our estimates, and it's really hard to know exactly what happened. It turns out that working class immigrants do not answer a ton of surveys, but our best guess is that they swung 23 percentage points against the Democratic Party. And so the crazy thing is, if you believe this and there's some uncertainty, but I think some version of this is probably true, then something like half of the net votes that Trump received came from immigrants. And this wasn't efficient for him. It's one of the big reasons, why the bias of the electoral college went down by so much this cycle. Because if you look in the battleground states, things swung toward Trump maybe by like half a percentage point. And that was enough for him to win or one percentage point. But if you look at the four biggest states where immigrants are concentrated New York, California, Texas, Trump did extremely well. And so it wasn't very efficient for him. But in terms of people changing their mind It was a massive percentage of the story. So this gets to another way that I think the data has proven conventional wisdom from at least 2020 wrong. So 2020, you have an election that Joe Biden wins. He wins by less than the polling says he will win by. And one reason he wins by less than the polling says he'll win by, is that Donald Trump does much better with Hispanic and Asian voters than he was expected to. And I remember seeing pretty strong research afterwards and talking to people who study the Hispanic vote who were saying, well, in 2020, the pandemic really scrambled what the election was about. So in 2016, the election was about immigration. In 2020, it was about the pandemic. It was about lockdowns. It was about the economy. And so Hispanic voters who were driven off of Trump by his border talk in 2016 were more likely to vote for him in 2020. But that was weird, right. It was the pandemic, in a way, moderating Donald Trump's appeal. 2024 Trump runs, I would say, to the right of where he was on the border in 2016, right. We're talking mass deportations. We're talking more than a wall. And Trump does better among immigrant groups, and he really ever has before. So the Democratic belief that when the topic turned back to immigration, you would see some of that polarization around Trump return and that he would be harmed in immigrant communities did not occur. No inflation probably played some kind of role here, though. The flip side is if you look in the UK, it happened the same year. It's just that the incumbent was right wing instead of left wing. And their labor did also drop with black and Asian and Hindu voters. And so I think that there's some kind of globalized right wing phenomena that's happening. It's hard to know exactly what, but I agree completely. Now just move on to the next slide here we have Harris support by single age year by race and gender. I found this chart a little hard to read. So can you describe to me what's happening here. Sure so we have four lines on this chart. And the x-axis is age. And the axis is our estimate. For what fraction of people in that group voted for Kamala Harris in 2024. And we have a light blue line for women of color. We have a dark blue dashed line for men of color. We have a light pink solid line for white women, and then a dashed line for white men. And one of the things you can see here is if you just look at 18-year-olds, 18-year-old women of color are the only of the four that actually voted that Harris won. Trump narrowly won nonwhite men. So I do find this part of this chart shocking it. I sometimes talk about narrative violations. And I think if we knew anything about Donald Trump eight years ago. It's at young people did not like him. And Republicans are maybe throwing away young people for generations in order to run up their margins among seniors. But if you look at this chart among white men who were 75 years old supported Kamala Harris at a significantly higher rate than white men who were 20 years old. That's exactly right. That's a real shift. It is a real shift. This is the thing I am the most shocked by. I think in the last four years, is that young people have gone from being the most progressive generation since the baby boomers, and maybe in some ways more so to becoming potentially the most conservative generation that we've experienced maybe in 50 to 60 years. And so the next chart, just to describe it, this chart in some ways convinced me to do this podcast. Oh Thank you. This chart shocks me. I agree, this is to me the scariest chart in this entire presentation. And again, something I'm very surprised by. In the bottom, we have age, and at the top, we have the gender gap in support between women and men and for support for Kamala Harris. And so what you can see is that for voters over 30, the gender gap was fairly stable at around 10 percent which is roughly where it's been in American politics. For voters over 75, it's even lower. That's right. Fairly low gender gap among older voters. Yeah, I think that a lot of people underestimate how recent the gender gap is. Historically, Republicans did better with women than men. And this was true across most of the West that center left parties did better with men than women. And that's changed in the United States in the Clinton era. But it's been stable since then. But what's crazy is if you look at people who are under the age of 30, the gender gap has exploded. If you look at 18-year-olds, 18-year-old men were 23 percentage points more likely to support Donald Trump than 18-year-old women, which is just completely unprecedented in American politics. Is that abortion. I think it's too early to say exactly what the cause is. What's interesting is that this is happening in other countries as well. Obviously, different countries have different political systems, but I've seen similar patterns in Canada, in the UK, in Norway, there's a lot of research to do here. But it's still very striking. A lot of people talk about the Democratic young men problem, and I think it's still somehow underrated because the actual numbers are just a lot worse than people think. The huge gender gap implies to me, it's not just inflation. Women pay high prices for eggs, too. And I'll say, if you look at the UK election last year, the Labour Party did a lot better because the incumbent party was unpopular. But I think what's interesting is that if you look at it by age, the conservatives actually increased their vote share among 18 to 24-year-old voters, I think by 2 percent or 3 percent even though they only did even though they did 8 percent or 9 percent worse overall. And so I do think it's not just inflation. It's not just backlash to the incumbent governments, though I'm sure that's part of the story, too. I feel like the story you're implying that you believe here is that this is polarization among young men and women, driven by men who are in high school, who are young, who are online, practically online during COVID as MeToo is cresting at the time of as Jordan Peterson is a big figure. Andrew Tate is rising. UVA now gets called the manosphere. But there is a sense the Democratic Party is becoming much more pro-women party. And in some ways anti young men and that just had a huge effect on young men's political opinions. Well, I do want to just stress that this seems to be a global phenomena. And I don't want to over center the particular things the Democratic Party has done rather than the broader cultural. Peterson and Tate are global figures. No, exactly. I agree with that. What I'll say is I just think that we're in the midst of a big cultural change, that I think that people are really underestimating. If you look at Zoomers, I don't have slides on this, but there's just a lot of really interesting ways that they're very different in the data. They're much more likely than previous generations to say that making money is extremely important to them. They are a lot more. If you look at their psychographic data, they have a lot higher levels of psychometric, neuroticism and anxiety than the people before them. If I was going to speculate I think that phones and social media have a lot to do with this. I think it's very plausible to me. And I've heard people describe that these kids grew up looking at social media influencers as role models. But all I can say is that I think that young people today seem to have fairly different values than they did 10 years ago. How that translates into partisan politics depends on what the parties do, but I think it's a big shift. It seems plausible to me that social media, online culture are splitting the media that young men and women get that if you are young and online and a 23-year-old man who is interested in UFC, you're being driven into a very intensely male online world. Whereas if you are 23 years old and female and you are interested in things that the YouTube algorithm codes, that way you are not entering that world. You're actually entering the opposite world. You're seeing brené Brown, right. You're seeing these other things. The capacity to be in highly gendered media worlds is really different in 2024 than it was in 2004, and that's true worldwide. Yeah, I agree with that entirely. Online communities are way more gender segregated than offline communities are. And so in that respect, it should be unsurprising that suddenly shifting a bunch of young people's social worlds to be entirely online all at once cause the political situation to change. So Democrats are getting destroyed now among young voters. That's right. I do think there was. Even as the idea of the rising demographic Democratic majority had become a little discredited in 2016 and 2020. I do think Democrats believed that these young voters were eventually going to save them, that this was a last gasp of something that if Donald Trump couldn't run these numbers up among seniors. And you had millennials really coming into their voting power, Gen Z coming in. That was going to be the end of this Republican Party. And that just completely false. Yeah, I mean, it might be the beginning of this Republican Party. I have to admit, I was one of those liberals four years ago. And it seems like I was wrong. The future has a way of surprising us. The flip side of this is that Democrats made a bunch of gains among older voters, and I'm sure that they'll be happy that they did two years from now, two years from now in the midterms. But if we don't do anything about this, then this problem could become very bad. So right here, I have this slide. This is very simple. This is just showing exit poll favorability for the Democratic and Republican presidential candidate in 2020 and 2024. And I think it's just really important to ground any discussion of the election with the simple fact that Donald Trump was just as unpopular on election day last year as he was in 2020 and maybe even a little bit more unpopular. But what changed is that Biden had a net favorability rating of plus 6, and Harris had a net favorability rating of minus 6. So I want to play Mike Donilon, who was chief strategist to Joe Biden, was recently at a forum, and he made an argument that I think you at least could read this chart as backing up, which is that Biden was more popular in 2020 than Harris was in 2024. Maybe the Biden Harris switch was a mistake. Here's Donilon. Look, I think folks who had this view believe that Biden was going to lose. He didn't have it anymore. He had to get out. That was the best thing for the party. I understand that's their view. But, I have a view too, right. In my view, is that really I think it was insane. I think the party lost its mind. Did the party lose its mind. And that's why we see this chart. I think the best explanation for why Kamala Harris was unpopular is in this next slide, which is just that the Biden administration was extremely unpopular for most of its term. They saw their approval fall off a cliff after Afghanistan, and then it dropped further as inflation and immigration and the budget fights all happen in the fall. And then it never recovered. And I think the big challenge that Kamala Harris faced was just that she was seen as too close, to the Biden administration, which most voters considered to be a failure. And so, I mean, you can never tell. You can never tell a counterfactual world, but I think that Biden would have had an even harder time distinguishing himself from his record. Yeah, it would be even harder for Joe Biden to run away from Joe Biden, I guess. Yeah, looking at this chart, it looks like by January a plus 20 net disapproval. Maybe that was a little bit smaller in November, but it had been widening. I mean, you go back to the beginning of 2023, it was narrower. People were really pissed at the Biden administration, by the time we hit the election. Yeah, I think that the big salient fact about this election. And, I don't think it was impossible for Kamala to do better. This was a winnable election. At the end of the day, it was very close. But this was the big thing, that was weighing Democrats down. And so I just want to move forward, just in terms of why, in our polling, the way that we measure issue importance is we show people two random issues and we just ask which of these problems is more important to the problems facing the country today. And people pick. And when you model it out, whenever you have cost of living or inflation put up against something else, eight or 9 out of 10 people picked that cost of living and inflation was more important. And so I think this just really shows how dominant this was. Voters were really angry about the Biden administration's handling of inflation, of the budget deficit of crime of immigration. And I think that was just a hard thing to escape. Well, you just ticked off a bunch of issues. But what's interesting to me about this particular bit of data is it shows that cost of living and inflation beat almost anything you put in front of it, so I agree. What I find notable here I mean Yeah, cost of living was bigger than student debt fare, but you tested it against immigration and border security and the share of voters saying cost of living or inflation was more important was about 70 percent That's right you tested it against abortion. Their cost of living or inflation was more important to about 80 percent of voters against environment and climate change. 84 percent of voters picked cost of living inflation. One thing that the Biden people always believed was that this election would be very heavily about democracy itself. I mean, this was something that I was told by top Biden strategists going way back. I don't see democracy on here. January 6. The stability of the system. Did you test that, too. No we did. And later we have a slide on. I mean, I'm just going to scroll down to it now since you brought it up. But we did a survey where we just asked people, what's more important right now preserving America's institutions or delivering change that improves people's lives. And it was 78 to 18. Delivering change that improves people's lives. And I'm just going to scroll up. But I think what's really hard, I think this has been one of the hardest things about being a political consultant in the last eight years is that every day, Trump does terrible things that I think are objectively awful and scary, and it piss me off. I'm going to prosecute my enemies or whatever. And then we do a bunch of tests and voters really don't want to hear about it. From us, I think that Trump would do better if he didn't do that stuff. For sure. But I think that voters want us to talk about concrete ways that they're going to improve people's lives. There is an argument you hear from many Democrats. There was no problem here except for inflation, that, in fact, if you compare Democratic vote outcomes with incumbent parties in many other countries, Democrats did better than incumbent parties in other countries did. So you look at the conservatives in the UK, they had a much worse election result. You look at what happened to the ruling coalition in France. In some ways Democrats were doing fine. They had a fairly modest drop in support. And it's just a shame for them that inflation happened on their watch, that if Donald Trump had won the 2020 election, inflation would have happened on his watch, completely discrediting him and his administration. And that would have been the end of them. How do you distinguish between. There is a broad structural problem the Democratic Party is facing that it needs to think about for 2028, and there's actually no problem here. But I think I just want to go over to the next slide. When we measure issues, we measure how important voters find it. And that's what we have in the bottom here. And then we just measure. Do you trust Democrats or Republicans more on this issue. And what you see here is if you look at the top issues that voters care the most about cost of living, the economy, taxes and government spending the deficit, foreign policy, health other than health, where Democrats have a narrow lead, Republicans have massive trust advantages 15 points on all of the issues that voters care the most about. And so the story that I would tell in response to your question is that in this election, voters trusted Republicans way more than Democrats on all of the most important issues, but also bought into this idea that Donald Trump was a terrible person who couldn't be trusted with power. And that made the election be close. But four years from now, Donald Trump will not be the nominee, and maybe they'll nominate somebody who's just as terrible and just as unlikable. But if we don't, get out of this trust deficit, I think that we'll have a lot of problems for people listening along. This is a chart broken into quadrants. That's right. And the top right quadrant is issues that are very important and issues where Democrats are more trusted. And it's an untilled bit of farmland up there. That's right. So there's mental health, which voters don't rate that important, but they do trust Democrats quite a bit more. They rate it higher than they rate, though. Climate change and the environment and abortion, which struck me as surprising. Mental health seems like a much bigger deal on this then you typically then I think politics reflects on either side right there. One bright spot is really health care. That's right. That's kind of it in terms of issues where it is quite important and they have a genuinely noticeable advantage. Yeah, I think it's just worth saying that four years ago the number one issue was COVID and health care. And those also were the issues that people trusted Democrats the most on. And so the strategy was really obvious. Just talk a lot about COVID and health care. But this time we had a much harder problem, which was that the issues that people cared the most about for the most part, voters didn't trust us on and the issues that people did trust us on climate change, and reproductive rights, probably the big ones voters just didn't care very much about. And so that was just a very difficult strategic position. And it's also one that was just very different than it was four years ago. All right. I just want to tick off some issues voters ranked as important that they trusted Republicans on and then ask you a question about it. So they thought. Cost of living, the economy and inflation were very important. Had a lot more trust in Republicans. They thought national security and foreign policy were important. Trusted Republicans, taxes. Government spending. Government debt. Trusted Republicans. Crime immigration. Trusted Republicans. Social Security. Trusted Republicans. That seems like a bad one for Democrats, a political division they thought was important. They trusted Republicans. A bit more on that in this data. If I looked over time, if I looked at 2016 and I looked at 2020, would I see on all of these that Republicans had advantages and Democrats were just winning on health care. How much of this is something flipping around as an incumbent penalty and reaction to conditions in the country at that moment, and how much of it is a durable situation where Republicans have a trust advantage, where Democrats would have to act in a spectacular way over time to change voters impressions of them on that issue. What we saw in our data was that as the Biden administration became a lot more unpopular all of these things dropped a lot. So some of it was uniform shift. But I think that the last four years, there were some things that structurally changed a lot in every center left party in the world. Generally the left has its issues that it owns and the right has its issues that it owns. But usually the economy is pretty neutral. During the Trump administration, the economy was fairly neutral. And in 2020, I think if you looked at this and even in 2021, it really didn't look anything like this. Another really big shift was just that education has gone from being basically one of the best issues for Democrats to being something that's basically neutral now. And we saw that in the Virginia gubernatorial election in 2021, we even saw it be an advantage for Republicans. And then the other big shift in the other side was that reproductive rights used to be a fairly neutral issue for Democrats like in general. When you talked about it in the pre Dobbs era, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't something that changed a lot of oats. And immediately after Dobbs, we saw a party trust on reproductive rights shoot up. And so I think these numbers they do change. And this is one of the big messages I want to get through is just that, the world has changed a lot in the last four years. It's going to keep changing. And we have to adjust in response to what happens. All right. So this tell me what's going on in this next slide. Because I also, as I understand this is really very connected to the work you do specifically. So what are you doing here. All right. So one of the big things that my firm does, it's probably our biggest product is that we do randomized controlled trials on ads. This is something that both parties do. This is pretty standard. But the idea is that for a given ad, you take 1,000 people split them into a treatment and control group. 500 people see the ad, 500 people don't. And then you survey them after. And you see, ask them who they're voting for. And then the difference between treatment and control can be described as the causal effect of if you see this ad, this is the effect it will have on your chance of voting for them. And so we tested on the order of I'd say probably like four or $5,000 Harris ads last cycle. And I just wanted to call out these two ads that were in the top 1 percent of ads that we tested. One is from Kamala Harris. I get it. The cost of rent, groceries and utilities is too high. So here's what we're going to do about it. We will lower housing costs by building more homes and crack down on landlords who are charging too much. We will lower your food and grocery bills by going after price gougers who are keeping the cost of everyday goods too high. I'm Kamala Harris and I approve this message because you work hard for your paycheck, you should get to keep more of it. As president, I'll make that my top priority. Obviously, there's a lot for several parts of the Democratic coalition there. Another ad by future forward shows attacks him for a national sales tax for the idea that Trump's tax him being Trump. Yeah attacks Trump. He fights for himself and his billionaire friends. He intends to enact a national sales tax. The Trump tax that would raise prices on middle class families by $4,000 a year. Instead of a tax hike, we will pass a middle class tax cut that will benefit more than 100 million Americans. As attack is responsible for the content of this ad, these were obviously the best ads in the campaign. And the point, I just want to say is, I think this reinforces the point that what voters cared the most about was the cost of living, and that voters were really mad about the actual situation. And I think that Harris being able to in this ad acknowledging oh, things are actually very bad. I don't like this. I have a plan to fix. This is part of what made it so effective. There is a view out there. I saw Jacobin had just done some research on this, which is a socialist publication that at the beginning of the Harris campaign, sprint, I mean, she was only the head of the Democratic ticket for three months. She was talking a lot about the economy and that by the end, she was talking a lot about democracy, that there had been a change in the nature of the campaign, the ads it was running, how they were messaging. Their big closing argument was that the ellipses in Washington, DC, which is where the January 6 riots, in a way, began that there was phases of the Harris campaign, and the first one was more populist and the last one was more institutional. From what you saw, was that true. I think that there was this big strategic question that Democrats faced. And it wasn't just the Harris campaign, which is polling would tell them you should talk about the economy, or voters care a lot about the cost of living. But it's very hard, one to get media attention on those things. And two, I think that Trump has done a good job of baiting us. I think what's really interesting about a lot of the democracy and authoritarian stuff is just that how concerned you are by it really varies a lot by political engagement and by education and the kind of people who set media decisions at CNN or who work in politics are the kinds of people who are going to be much more concerned about it, than working class folks are. And so I think that but but look, there is a difference between the Harris campaign was running the optimal David Shor strategy in late October of 2024, and they were not. The Harris campaign had access future before it had access to all of this issue by issue polling. They had access to all this randomized ad testing. Did they run a heavily economic campaign and it didn't work, or did they not run a heavily economic campaign at the end. And it didn't work, because, look, if they did the thing and it didn't work, then maybe it just didn't work. Did they not do it. Yeah, I mean, asking the hard questions. But yeah, I think obviously, I think that Democratic messaging last cycle was not economically focused enough. I think that it focused too much on narratives of defending institutions, defending democracy. And I think it's just very easy, for folks to fall into that trap. But I really don't. But why. If they did that and I heard this from different people. David Plouffe is a smart guy. I'm not telling you to. I'm not asking you to critique David Plouffe. I can watch you getting physically uncomfortable as I. As I harm your business here. right, right. But these people all wanted to win. They really did. Every single one of them. And they had a lot of data. So I think this has been a thing on my mind. If they weren't running the optimal strategy, why. I know it's hard to get media attention for things, and that's fair enough. But it's also not impossible to get media attention for things right. For instance, it's very easy to get media attention for anti-price gouging policies because there's a lot of controversy over them about whether or not they worked. But they did make people talk about whether or not you were going to do an anti-price gouging policy. This is a Donald Trump move, constantly announce a policy that probably doesn't work, or is in some way outrageous or beyond the bounds of political possibility, maybe isn't even all that popular when you poll, but you get people talking about you having a very strong view. You're going to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it. Everybody knows Mexico isn't going to pay for it. But you are talking about how Donald Trump hates immigration. And it breaks through. It is not rocket science to get people to pay attention. If Bernie Sanders had been running in the campaign, people would have paid attention to his economic messaging because he does economic messaging that creates conflict. If it was really this big delta between the economic push and the institutions push, and the institutions push is what got made, or at least got made more than 1, it should have. Why the thing I'll say, in terms of why I'm sympathetic to the people who actually had these jobs and had to make these decisions, is it just feels wrong. I have a situation, I mentioned this before where donors will email me and they'll be like Oh, look at this crazy, absolutely terrible thing, this evil thing that Trump is doing. We need to test it. We need to tell the voters, can you test it. And it really doesn't work. People want to hear about eggs. And it's easy for me to say that, because I don't really I'm not directly in charge. But I just think it just feels really wrong when you're in the moment. It's just it's very hard to totally shift direction, just because data tells you one thing. I do think the campaign photo ops that we all remember at the end are telling, which is it was an extraordinary visual. Harris at the Ellipse. And then there were the visuals of Donald Trump in a garbage truck and Donald Trump at McDonald's. And there was a Ridiculousness to those visuals. I saw a lot of liberals making fun of them on various social media platforms, but there was something about which visuals are being chosen by the two candidates. I mean, of the two of them, only Kamala Harris had actually worked at a McDonald's. Sure, but she wasn't the one who ended up like putting on the apron and getting photographed at McDonald's. And there's a thing about what the candidates end up wanting to do that is meaningful to. And I do think there's a way in which I wonder if that explains part of what we ended up seeing. Each coalitions campaigns are ultimately going to reflect the aesthetic and cultural choices of the people who staff them. And, it makes sense. If you had just said two years ago, Trump's going to end by showing up at a McDonald's. Like, it just wouldn't have been surprising, I think. And so it's just hard to escape, that kind of demographic pull. But we have to try because we have to actually win these people over. And so now I just have I have a couple more slides I want to go through. I talked about this before, but voters cared a lot more about delivering change than preserving institutions. And then we have this other polling question here, which I think is interesting, which is just asking people to pick between the statements. Things could be going better in America, but what we need is a return to basic stability. And the other is things in America are going poorly, and what's needed is a major change and a shock to the system. And when you have those two things, it's 53, 37, which is a lot wider than the election result ended up being. What really strikes me about this is that sometimes I read polls, and the wording is pretty clearly there to make something sound better than the other thing. Things could be going better in America, and what is needed is return to basic stability from whoever becomes president. And things in America are going poorly, and what is needed is a major change and a shock to the system from whoever becomes president. I would in some ways say the second there is worded to turn people off a little bit, it sounds disruptive crisis, a shock. It's not just major change. It is something beyond that. And it dominates, I guess, though, I have a question about this, which is on the one hand, we see lines like that outpolling the incremental change everywhere. On the other hand, if you look at the New split ticket ratings for who overperformed in the election. Very moderate. House Democrats did very well. Totally there does seem to me to be a tension between two forms of political wisdom that both have data behind them right now. Which is that voters want huge, massive change. And the optimal political strategy is Joe Manchin or Jared Golden or Ruben Gallego, who are actually not. Or Susan Collins, who are not people who promise unbelievably shocking change. They are moderates who kind of tack between the parties a little bit and try to represent a center that wants something a little bit less dramatic than either side is offering. How do you reconcile them. There's an enormous amount of status quo bias in politics. Campaigning on big policy changes can be pretty unpopular. But I think the way to thread the needle, what this is really saying is that voters were very angry about the state of things, and what they wanted tonally was someone who acknowledged that anger because Ruben and Gallego did a lot of criticism of the status quo and was able to outperform. So people on an angry moderate. That's right. I think that's exactly right. Like they want not AI always think of temperament and ideology as being separate axes in American politics that we connect too much. So we think about people who are moderates often have the moderate temperament. Susan Collins is like the great example, the joke always of the Susan Collins meter from somewhat concerned all the way to very concerned being the red line for her. You have a lot of moderates who by nature they're pretty chill. They try to be civil. What this is implying is what people want are moderate policies in a more revolutionary or certainly more upset temperament. Yeah, we're pissed, but not ideologically extreme about it. It's like a funny chant. But when people think about moderates, they think of somebody like Joe Manchin, someone who's just like down the line on everything. And the reality. I think that an accurate description of what highly educated moderates are like. But most low socioeconomic status moderates actually have fairly incoherent views. They're liberal on some issues. They're very conservative on other issues. And I think that that's just like a much closer fit. For And that's when you think of that, it's maybe less surprising that a lot of them Donald Trump back in 2016, I wrote a piece about Donald Trump that has one of these headlines that now people will sometimes screenshot and be mad at me about but it's called something like Donald Trump is a perfect moderate. And the point of the piece was not that he's not extreme, because I think he is extreme, but that the way his politics worked, practically on the campaign trail in things he said, was that it was internally disorganized, so he'd be extremely far right on immigration. But compared to other Republicans, much more centrist on things like Medicare and Social Security. He would talk about giving health care to everybody, even though Republicans wouldn't like that. He talked about raising taxes on people like him, not how he governed. But there's a lot of research that actual moderates, people in the elected who are moderate. It's not that they have in between the two parties view on everything, it's that they might believe in completely legalized weed, on the one hand, and mass deportations on the other, that it's like if you imagine positions as being they can be very liberal or very conservative. They average out to moderate as opposed to being consistently moderate. That's exactly right. And the way I like to put that in math terms, the issue correlations for highly educated people are just a lot higher than they are. Your eyebrows get excited when you do math terms. Yeah no. I'm sorry. It's all right. But I'm glad we started talking about ideology because that dovetails to the next slide. Here we just ask for each of the candidates. Do you think this candidate was more liberal than me, more conservative than me, or close to my views. So when you look at this slide, what you see is that 49 percent of voters said that Kamala Harris was more liberal than me, while only 39 percent of voters said that Donald Trump was more conservative than me. And so there was this big ideological perception gap where a lot of voters saw Donald Trump as more as more moderate than Kamala Harris. What did this look like in 2016 and 2020? So in 2016, it looked fairly similar to this. In 2020, perceptions of Donald Trump being too extreme went up relative to 2016, and perceptions of the Democratic candidate being too extreme went down from 2016 to 2020. Now that I think wasn't a property of Joe Biden per se. Like, him being moderate was a big part of his brand at that time. But in our polling, we would ask, do you think that Joe Biden is too liberal or too conservative or whatever. And we saw that over the course of 2021, as his approval ratings dipped, the perception that he was too liberal also went up. Well, it's also true that Joe Biden became more liberal like in terms of how he governed and in terms of what he ran on. So you're saying that in the 2020 election, you actually did see people say that they were ideologically closer to Biden than to Trump. Yes And then over time, that eroded, that eroded. The thing I want to say here before I move on is I'm really not trying to beat up on Kamala Harris here. I think if you just step back, if you have a situation where the Democratic Party, where only 42 percent of Americans trust the Democratic Party on the economy relative to 58 for Republicans. Obviously, the standard bearer of the Democratic Party is going to be perceived as too left wing unless they unless they do a lot of stuff to try to counterbalance that. I mean, people were living under the biden-harris administration, whatever they thought of it. The line Trump would sometimes deliver on Harris, which in many ways is unfair if you're a super politically engaged voter and you have a lot of thoughts about the powers of the vice presidency. But to most people, if you have all these great ideas, why don't you do them. In the last four years, while your vice president was a pretty strong argument. I think there's a good argument that given that, it's amazing that we did as well as we did. But it was a close election. And so who knows what the counterfactual could have been. I want to note something as a dog that is not barking across this presentation. Yeah since the election, I think that if you look at what Donald Trump is doing, what Elon Musk is doing, and if you look at punditry about the election, that if everybody agrees on anything, it's that the election was a huge verdict on wokeness. Famously, one of Trump's higher testing ads was this Kamala Harris is her they/them Donald Trump is for you as you're running through this. I'm not saying you're saying DEI programs are popular, but I'm not seeing it emerge as a major explanation for 2024 here. I'm curious how you both think about it in the election and think about the role that's playing in the post-election narrative. I just want to say, they/them ad that everybody talks about it was a good ad, but it was like a 70th percentile ad. In our testing, if you look at all of the best testing ads from Donald Trump, it was basically the economy. It was gas prices, it was immigration, it was crime. And so I think that there's definitely been an overfocus on die, on wokeness, on trans issues. I think it definitely played a role on the elite discourse and why so many tech CEOs have become more right wing. And all of that. But I think that the voters were really mad about inflation and crime and immigration and the budget deficit. And I think the Republicans are making a mistake, honestly, to focus on these things. So much relative to concrete issues that people actually care about. I think that there's this bigger picture point I want to make where I think that a lot of people see the Trump administration as kind of a break that shows that all of the traditional rules of politics, no longer apply. And I think to some extent that's wrong, that a lot of what's happening is really very easy to understand. Donald Trump, to go back to the ideological thing he broke with his party. He might have been dishonest about it, but he disavowed Project 2025. He said that he wouldn't cut Social programs, he ruled out a national abortion ban. And I think that kind of thing just plays a big role in his success. And I think that a lot of these newer things that we talk about might be less important than we think. But the flip side is it's possible that when it comes to something like, why is it that 20-year-old men are so much more conservative than they were four years ago. I could believe maybe wokeness has something to do with that, but I think that the bulk of this is traditional factors. So now I just have the last slide of the retrospective. What I have here is we have the share of voters who get their news from TikTok by year, the share of voters who get their news of young voters, who get their news from TikTok more than quadrupled in the last four years. This is the biggest and probably fastest change in media consumption. That has happened in my lifetime and it was quite correlated with support change. Now, obviously TikTok users are younger, they're less politically engaged. It's not surprising that we dropped among this group. You'd expect that from demographics. But if you go and you do the regressions, I think there was definitely a causal element there. And when you Zoom in, particularly to people who get their news from TikTok who don't care very much about politics, this is a group that's eight percentage points more Republican than they were four years ago. And that's a lot. So by the end of the election, Donald Trump is promising to save TikTok. One possible explanation, then, for TikTok users shifting towards Trump is that they like TikTok, and they didn't want it to be taken away from them. Another, which people have worried about quite a bit, is that the company behind TikTok could very easily have been turning dials just softly. It's not that nothing that is liberal does well on TikTok. I've seen videos of me get posted there and do very well on TikTok, but that it would not be hard to turn up the dial a little bit on issues that are tricky for Democrats. On people complaining about the cost of living on pro-trump influencers. If everybody who the algorithm codes is, pro-trump gets a 7 percent boost. That is pretty that will not be obvious exactly on the app, but could be very, very meaningful in the aggregate when you look at this data. Do you think it is something about TikTok. Do you think it is something about TikTok's audience just being young people who are seeing this movement. Or does it make you suspect dial turning. I don't know the answer to that. It's totally possible. Like, we know that they do. Dial turning on some topics, stuff like Ukraine or Tiananmen Square or whatever. But what I'll say is, I think that TikTok represents something fairly radically different than social networks that came before it. And I'm sure you know that there could be some malfeasance on the part of people who work there. But the thing that I think about sometimes is just that. I think TikTok is really the first social media platform that is really, truly decentralized. Like if you. And what I mean by that is just it's not based on follower graphs. Like if you look at reels or Twitter or whatever, how many people see a video or a piece of content is highly correlated with how many followers that person has. TikTok's a lot more random, and there's very interesting machine learning reasons for why but I think that it really allowed a lot of content that never would have gotten a lot of views on Twitter or on television to suddenly escape containment and get directly into the eyes of people who don't care that much about politics. And, I don't could tell a story that maybe just anti-incumbent stuff is going to do really well on TikTok and Democrats are going to do great. Now, I don't really know. But I think that for whatever reason, this big change I think really did help Republicans. And it's just an example of how the world has really changed a lot. So I know that you're near Democratic both freak out and funding world. I hear a lot from Democrats about how to fix what they now call their media problem. Or sometimes you hear the TikTok problem, maybe pay try to seed creators and give them some support. When you look at this, do you think this is something that an established political party and a bunch of donors can do something about. Or do you think this is a TikTok is a vibes machine. And basically for reasons of inflation, for reasons of incumbency, for reasons of censorious Democratic Party that people got tired of the vibes are bad for Democrats in 2024, and vibes machines like TikTok some of the other social media things, they're going to be an amplifier of bad vibes. So it's not really a thing to do in the sense of strategy. What you're trying to do is be culturally, both in terms of the candidates you have and the actual things you say and believe. Culturally a better product, and then the things that pick up good cultural products and amplify them are going to be friendlier to you. I think there's a lot of truth in that. I think that TikTok is genuinely strange relative to platforms before it, in that its audience is more politically disengaged and more working class, and I think it's just been very hard for us as a party to find creators and content that appeals to people like that because all of the people who work in Democratic politics are not like that. And I think that in the old traditional media world, we were a lot like the media gatekeepers. And so it was kind of clear how to win that war. And I think Democrats did a good job of doing it. But now we have a totally different fight. So just to move on and talk a little bit about the present as opposed to the long, long time ago of four or five months ago. So, you've talked a lot in your previous episodes about Trump's flood the zone strategy, where he's just constantly doing a bunch of stuff. And what we've done here is we've pulled all his executive orders and stuff that he's campaigned on. I think we have something like 60, 60 dots here. Every one of these dots is a policy that we've pulled. And what you can see is that there's a lot of variance. A lot of the things that he campaigned on no taxes on tips, deploying the military to the border. Voter ID laws, ending remote work for federal employees. A lot of that stuff is very popular. While the flip side is a lot of stuff that he's actually doing. He talks about this stuff less, but Medicaid cuts, repealing the Aca, extending tax cuts to billionaires, a lot of that stuff is really unpopular. Just to say something a little controversial. I think a lot of the challenge of the Trump era is that they're going to try to bait us we should do everything we can to actually meaningfully resist and protect populations that we care about and everything. But I think we need to make sure that we're preserving a considerable amount of time, to attacking Trump on the most effective things that voters are concerned about. You used the term bait a few times. Yeah they're going to try to bait us. I think of a political party baiting you as dangling something in front of you that they know is going to make you mad, but it isn't that big of a deal. They're doing mass firings around critical functions. They're destroying USAID. They're aggregating huge amount of executive power. The set of things that I find Democrats are really worried about at the moment. It's on the one hand, I suspect they're not the things that the public cares about wants to hear that much about making a podcast or the deputy director of the FBI. But at the same time, they're not baiting. They're real. They're important. Like what is the point of a party that will not fight those. And this is a place where I think there is a tension between this focus on what's popular. Don't focus on just the things that activate your high education, high income base. But in terms of getting people out into the streets, potentially, if you need that, getting people to town halls, there's sometimes I think this thought of the party is just going to I mean, James carville's been saying Democrats should basically play dead for a while and wait until the Trump administration's unpopular actions destroy the Trump administration, but don't get in the way. Or there's this version of a party that various things Hakeem Jeffries has said at different points have sounded like this to people, I think is thinking is a little bit more complicated than this. But we're not going to run after all these things. We're going to focus on the price of eggs, the price of goods. You can really lose your own base if you're not defending democracy. When they care about democracy because you're waiting for an opportunity to attack prices, when prices are going to do what prices are going to do. What Democrats say about prices isn't the most salient thing. Am I getting what you're saying right. Is there a way of threading the needle. How do you think about that. Yeah, I think you could imagine a theoretical world where we would have really hard and unpleasant trade offs. But I think the world we actually live in is that a bunch of the things that we're extremely concerned about are actually really unpopular. And just kind of going forward to the next slide. Here's some randomized control trial data that we did that I was talking about earlier with the ads, where we just kind of went through. And we looked at 58 different things that Trump's going to do. And then we rank ordered them by how persuasive they were at actually changing people's votes and making people disapprove of Trump. And I think that a lot of the things that we're most concerned about Ellen, causing chaos in the federal government cuts to Medicaid and Medicare and Social Security, extending tax breaks for the rich. I obviously this list of things is not exactly the same as my top five things that I am personally most concerned about with the Trump administration. But I think that the Republicans are making a lot of unforced errors that make it easier to thread the needle on these things than I think it otherwise would be true. But these are also pretty small changes in Trump disapproval if I'm reading what this chart is. If Democrats attack Trump for cutting Medicare and Social Security or wanting to cut Medicare and Social Security, that increases Trump disapproval by 2.5 points. If they attack him for letting Ellen budgets, hurting Americans and putting privacy at risk, that hurts him by 2.2 points. Going down. Passing a one party power grab to cut government services without compromise. That's 2.1 points. These kind of all look the same, and none of them are very big. Can you just like, think for a second like this is like, can you imagine 70 words you like, stop a Trump voter on the street and you say the 70 words to him, and then there's a 2.2 5 percent chance he changed his mind. I think that's incredible. I just think that these two pieces of data tell a story of how we should try to shape the campaign against Trump in the next couple of months, which is that he is wrecking havoc in the federal government. I think that is consistent with our principles and also something that voters are very concerned about. That he is trying to support for the safety net and that he's trying to do tax cuts against the wealthy. And I think that a lot of this critique of Trump is really very similar to the campaign that we ran against Mitt Romney. And I think that this kind of gets back to what I was saying before of I feel like, we were so shocked by Trump that we kind of forgot that the old rules of politics. I want to read two of these because I think something you just said is important when we're talking about these old laws of politics. So here, here's these are all high polling, high testing messages. But this is the lowest one on the chart. So Trump is working to repeal a law that lowers the cost of health and prescription drug costs and caps insulin costs at 35 a month for seniors. By repealing this law, Trump will increase the cost of life saving medicine for millions and create more financial strain when costs are already too high. So that increases Trump disapproval by 1.9 points. I think that is as right down the middle, a Democratic message as you could possibly imagine that does not test as well as Trump is letting Elon Musk federal budgets with no oversight, checks or balances. Musk gave $250 million to Trump's campaign, and now Trump is letting Musk reshape the government in ways that advance Musk's interests, even if they hurt working Americans by cutting the basics like Medicaid and public schools. I am actually surprised that the Elon Musk is out attack is outpolling the insulin attack. And it's interesting because I see this in Trump voters in my own life right there. Some of the ones I they're actually not happy with what's going on in the Trump administration. There's a lot they don't like. There's a lot going on, but too much. But Musk creeps them out. Is that in your data. I think it's really telling that Elon stuff floats to the top here because it's really very hard for something to be competitive with, protect Social Security and Medicare. The fact that there are multiple Elon things up at the top, I think, really does tell a story that there's something really unusual about what he's doing. It's very easy to tie what he's doing to harming individual people. In ads, one of the clearest patterns in ads is that getting a real person and just having them stare at a camera and talk about the ways that Republicans have personally hurt them, it's the best content. It's funny, if you hire actors, it doesn't work as well. People have tried. And that's why in some ways, I'm optimistic that Democrats will be able to thread the coalitional needle here because we should like the two things that we should do is fight against social welfare cuts and also attack Elon Musk for the chaos he's creating. And I think that that's something that basically every wing of the party should be on board with. Donald Trump is polling better than he was at this point in his first term. And the vibes have really shifted in pro-trump direction. And look at how much he and Elon Musk are doing. And, I've certainly talked to Republicans who have this feeling that Trump has unlocked a political juggernaut here, that he has cracked the code of American politics. But you have this. This slide is titled Trump is vulnerable. So why is he vulnerable. Well the first thing you see is that he has been getting more unpopular rapidly as time has gone on. And I just think the most predictable thing in American politics, and we get surprised every single time it happens is the president comes in, he wins a trifecta, and then he does a bunch of unpopular stuff. He overreaches, and then he becomes very unpopular and loses big in the midterms. That doesn't mean that you can't avoid the cycle. But I think that in order to avoid it, when you look at the people who did the best job, Clinton in 1998 or Kennedy in 1962 they did it by engaging in an enormous amount of policy restraint. And that is just not what Trump has been doing at all. And I think that you can just see in the data. But his approval rating is dropping pretty quickly, and you can see that he's just pissing off lots of people and that the stuff that a lot of the stuff that he's doing and drawing attention toward is really quite unpopular. There's also this reality of the coalitional realignment you were talking about at the beginning, which is Democrats now have this higher information, higher engagement coalition. Those are the people who turn out to midterms disproportionately. If I were a moderate Republican right now or a Republican in any way vulnerable, I know they're all afraid of Elon Musk and they're afraid of primaries. I'd be pretty afraid of losing, because it's not just that you tend to have thermostatic midterm elections, but that the coalitions have been changing such that Democrats are able to survive the 2022 midterm, which should have gone against them. And I think Dobbs saved them to some degree. But also the fact that their coalition was as you showed earlier. If only 20, 22 voters had come out in 2024, Harris would have won. You got to be pretty confident in Donald Trump's political skills to think that he is going to shift that dynamic. It seems that in addition to all the normal things that happens to presidents and midterms, the shape of the coalition makes midterms harder right now for Republicans. Yeah, I think that's exactly right. But that said, it gets to this tension in all of these Democratic soul searching conversations, which is if Democrats do nothing really like, they'll probably be O.K in 2026 because all of these voters, who get their news from TikTok, who don't care about politics, these voters under 25, they just really are not going to vote very much in the midterms. But if we don't fix this problem, then four years from now, we could be in the same trust deficit on all of these core issues. And these voters that didn't turn out in 2026 will come back. And except we'll be running against a candidate who's a lot less unpopular, potentially, than Trump. And we could be in a real problem, a real, real pickle. How about the Senate. So you and I did a big piece on debates about populism a couple years ago, involved a model that you had, and that model was predicting in 2022, but specifically 2024 Democratic Senate annihilation. And Democrats are down a couple of seats in the Senate. It's what is it, 5347 right. It's not a good map for them in 2026. And they did lose some seats that were really important to them tester and Montana and Brown in Ohio. How do you see the Democratic Senate future. If you had told me in 2019, when I started worrying about the 2024 Senate election, that we would have 47 seats, I would have jumped for joining me. I think the really big factors there is they Republicans ran a bunch of really terrible candidates in a bunch of swing races. And it turns out Democrats, those Democratic candidates, did a good job of distancing themselves from the party. I don't want to spend too much time speculating about the 2026 map, but I think that even though the bias in the electoral college has gone down quite a bit because of this swing among immigrants that doesn't really change that. The Senate, it's very hard for Democrats to take the Senate unless they can consistently outperform how Harris did and how Biden did in most of the country. These problems won't be fixed unless we spend the next two years or four years, changing the party's brand among working class voters who are overrepresented in the Senate. The one exception to this, I think and this is just controversial and might get me in trouble is I think that I'm just going to scroll up back to the Senate side. If you look in Nebraska, the single biggest overperformance that we had was Osborne running as an independent. He outperformed at the top of the ticket by 7.1 percent Now obviously, Nebraska is an extremely red state. And I think that we've only ever tried this strategy of running people who are literally formally not tied to the Democratic Party in extremely red states. But I think the argument for doing that kind of thing in an merely red states, in places like Florida or places like Ohio or Iowa. Those are hard questions. And it's not up to me, what we end up doing, but I think it's something that we have to really seriously consider. And then that also just brings up the really awkward point of like, well, what do we do with the reality that in most by land area, in most parts of the country, it's almost impossible for a Democrat or someone with a Democrat on their ticket to win. What do you do about the reality of the Democratic brand is toxic in. Yeah most of the land area in the country, because I think you can have this conversation that you always have to be careful about which conversation you're having is a conversation. Can Democrats win in 2026 or 2028? And the answer there is Yes. If the conversation is how do you get back to a place where you're putting states in play that Democrats have just kind of given up on. Mitch McConnell is retiring in Kentucky. There's a Democratic Governor in Kentucky. It's not literally true that no Democrat can ever win there. I don't think anybody seriously thinks so that a Democrat is going to win Mitch McConnell's seat, because the Democratic brand nationally, which is different than it's kind of state party brand, is pretty bad. And people understand when they're voting for Senate, they're voting for the National brand. So you been thinking about this for a long time. If you were trying to think about reversing these much deeper trends, right. These educational trends, this realignment that has. If your whole point in life was to make Democrats competitive again in Florida, in Missouri, in Kansas. Not the reddest states, but states that they were competitive in a couple of years ago. What would you advise Democrats to do. The reality of the situation right now, I think there are these big theoretical discussions we could have about what positions the Democrats could take. Is that Democrats are not in power right now. And so we don't have agenda control. And I think a lot of this just depends on what Trump does and what. And then who replaces Trump. Something I'll say going back to the 2016 the first time that Trump was president is that when we were looking at polling of non-college whites and these obama-trump voters, their approval rating for Trump was really very stable for most of his term. And the only time that it declined was when Trump tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act. And then we saw them revert to their old partisanship. But once that was out of the news, they switched back. And so I think that does kind of like at this moment, given that there is no party leader. I think it's mostly a question of if Trump does successfully push a bunch of welfare state cuts, then that might change the realignment. But I think realistically, at least until 2026, it's mostly a function of what Republicans do. But when we pick a new presidential candidate that will be a that will be a reset. And I think I don't think it's too early to talk about that, but I think that could imagine us picking candidates who would do a much better job. I think that is a good place to end. So always our final question. What are three books you would recommend to the audience. I'd say the three books for me, I want to call out hollow parties by Danny Salzman. He's a good friend of mine, and I think it's. And Sam rosenfelt and Sam Rosenfeld, of course, my old colleague. Yes I think it's hard to talk about a lot of these questions that I was kind of dodging about why parties were doing what they did without kind of reading that. The other thing I want to call out is something that was hugely influential for how I think about politics is a really nerdy pick, but the origin and nature of mass opinion by Xolair. It gets at this question of how much does what people say in surveys matter versus how much of it is downstream of what people are saying what elites are saying. And I think his answer is mostly elites, but both. And then the last thing I just wanted to call out was a victory lap by Sasha Eisenberg. It kind of talks a lot about the history of the Democratic analytics industry. A lot of the stuff that these numbers that I've shared here come out of that machine. And so if you're just interested in the history of the Democratic party's internal analytics and research structure, it's the only book really that's ever been written about it. David Shor, Thank you very much. Thank you.\n\nThis is an edited transcript of an episode of \"The Ezra Klein Show.\" You can listen to the conversation by following or subscribing to the show on the NYT Audio App , Apple , Spotify , Amazon Music , YouTube , iHeartRadio or wherever you get your podcasts .\n\nI've been spending some time recently with top Democrats as they think about how to rebuild after the 2024 loss. And in the 20-some years I've been covering politics, I have never heard Democrats so confused: about who they are - aside from their opposition to Donald Trump - as well as how and why they lost.\n\nDemocrats are losing working-class voters. They're seeing their margins among nonwhite voters erode and vanish. They're losing young voters. Something is wrong in the Democratic Party.\n\nSo I think it's important that the conversation among Democrats is grounded on a pretty real understanding of what happened in 2024.\n\nAnd someone whose analysis on this I have come to respect over the years is David Shor. He is the head of data science at Blue Rose Research, which is a big Democratic consulting firm that does a huge amount of political surveying, data interpretation and message testing.\n\nShor works with campaigns and progressive groups so he has a perspective from the inside. But he's also a very skilled interpreter of data. He has gotten a lot of things right before other people did, including that educational polarization was becoming the central fault line for democracy - not just in America but in other countries, too.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Democrats now need to be loud, aggressive and relentless in combating the lies, distortions, false claims and misinformation that have characterized the Republican Party since the rise of Trumpism.\n\nThis is not about merely criticizing President Trump in all the familiar ways. It is about continually and clearly providing Americans with the facts as well as the opposing viewpoint. The Biden administration utterly failed in this crucial department.\n\nMr. Carville's suggestion that Democrats should participate in a \"strategic political retreat\" sounds, tragically, exactly like what they have been doing. It is the exact opposite of what this period of American history demands.\n\nLisa Langhammer West Roxbury, Mass.\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nDemocrats who argue for adopting the political version of Muhammad Ali's rope-a-dope strategy really do not understand the depth of the political nihilism we face.\n\nThis administration is not concerned with losing power as long as it can dismantle the bureaucracy of the federal government before it happens.

But who will fill it?\n\nBy Reid J. Epstein and Katie Glueck\n\nReid J. Epstein reported from North Las Vegas, Nev., and Katie Glueck from New York.\n\nFor the last decade, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has been running for president, planning a run for president or pushing former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to adopt more progressive policies.\n\nBut now, as Democrats find their legal and fund-raising institutions under attack from the Trump administration, their base voters furious at their congressional leadership and their party's popularity at a generational low , progressives are also staring down the prospect of a post-Bernie future.\n\nA movement politician with a large and devoted base of supporters, the 83-year-old Mr. Sanders has signaled that he does not intend to run for president again . The question now is who will lead the network he built from scratch into the next presidential election and beyond.\n\nInterviews with nearly 20 progressive Democrats about the left wing's future revealed a faction that sees the ideas Mr. Sanders has championed - reducing the power of billionaires, increasing the minimum wage, focusing more on the plight of workers - as core to the next generation of mainstream Democratic politics.\n\nThough there is little agreement about who will emerge to guide progressives into a post-Sanders era, virtually everyone interviewed said there was one clear leader for the job: Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.\n\nAnd it just so happened that Mr. Sanders and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez spent three days last week on a \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour through Arizona, Nevada and Colorado. In Denver, they drew 34,000 people, what Sanders aides said was the largest crowd of his career. Neither has so much as obliquely referred to the torch-passing nature of their trip, and in an interview, Mr. Sanders declined to answer questions about whether Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, 35, would inherit his mantle.

They called on Pam Bondi, the attorney general, to conduct an investigation of a case that the Democrats called one of \"astonishingly poor judgment.\"\n\n\"Let us be clear,\" the letter said, \"if any American military service member, intelligence official, or law enforcement officer committed such an egregious breach of operational security and endangered the lives of their comrades downrange, they would be investigated and likely prosecuted.\"\n\nThe White House has dismissed the episode as a minor mistake and top congressional Republicans seemed ready to chalk it up as an inadvertent mix-up, but Democrats were in no mood to do so. After months of being on the defensive as the Trump administration made a series of extraordinary moves on foreign and domestic policy, Democrats see the security lapse as a glaring vulnerability that allows them to showcase administration incompetence.\n\nIt also allows them to remind the public and their Senate Republican colleagues that Democrats warned against the confirmation of Pete Hegseth as secretary of defense, portraying the former Fox News personality and National Guard veteran as inexperienced, unqualified and unsuited for the post. Mr. Hegseth disclosed operational details of the pending attack in Yemen in the text chain, whose existence was reported on Monday by Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of The Atlantic, who had been added to the chat and was following the discussion.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "May I Have Some More?\n\nThe timing of Abundance , the new book by the journalists Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson, is extraordinary. The good news is, the authors have dropped a potent political manifesto into the lap of a Democratic Party that seems confused about any messaging bolder than \"Trump take egg.\" Klein and Thompson offer a vision of a \"liberalism that builds,\" a can-do antidote to blue-state malaise.\n\nThe bad news, for this book and many other things besides, is our actual existing government, whose actions further undermine Klein and Thompson's ideas with each new day. Abundance has a chapter about how the National Institutes of Health has grown more conservative in its grantmaking, to the detriment of scientific discovery. Meanwhile, long-shot research projects have been singled out for mockery and defunding by Elon Musk and DOGE. The authors argue for a more flexible immigration policy, just as Tom Homan disappears asylum-seekers to the Panamanian jungle. And the authors suggest that climate change can be staved off only by investment and invention, right as the administration tries to claw back or freeze grants to green energy projects and universities.\n\nBy Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson. Avid Reader Press.\n\nSlate receives a commission when you purchase items using the links on this page.\n    Thank you for your support.\n\nIt's a bit like discussing how you'd like to redecorate your house while your neighbors strip the copper wiring from your walls. Still, if the book's vision of a world after abundance seems distant, its optimism is also compelling, even joyous. I'd say it's odds-on that the Democratic National Committee platform in 2028 uses the word abundance to describe some of its aspirations. It helps that Klein's megapopular column and podcast at the New York Times has him in contention for \"the most influential Democratic media figure.\" Just the other day, he was talking abundance with U.S. Rep. Jake Auchincloss of Massachusetts, and no doubt more Democrats will follow.\n\nTo see why this word has \"captured the imagination of the coastal wonk class,\" as Jordan Weissmann wrote last year , it helps to understand Klein and Thompson's diagnosis of Democratic paralysis. \"Progressivism's promises and policies, for decades, were built around giving people money, or money-like vouchers, to go out and buy something that the market was producing but that the poor could not afford,\" they write. Such policies have made up the backbone of Democratic politics for nearly a century: Social Security, minimum wage, food stamps, housing vouchers, Medicaid, Medicare, Pell Grants, child tax credits.\n\nBut those demand-side subsidies quickly lose their power if you do not ensure an adequate supply of the goods and services you want people to access. And here, we have a problem: \"Liberals spent decades working, at every level of government and society, to make it harder to build recklessly. They got used to crafting coalitions and legislation that gave everyone a bit of what they wanted, even if it meant the final product was astonishingly expensive, or slow to construct, or perhaps never found its way to completion at all.\" Thompson, a persistently clever reporter at the Atlantic, framed the antidote in a 2022 column that now reads like a book proposal: \"abundance.\"\n\nThe writers acknowledge up front that parts of the book are sewn together from their own published articles, and it suffers at times from a lack of clear structure. But Abundance is unabashed in synthesizing good ideas, stringing together (and generously citing, in the text) books and papers about NIMBYism, construction, environmentalism, clean energy, government technology, procurement rules, medicine, science, and invention to make its point. Klein and Thompson argue that liberals (with the occasional assist from conservative saboteurs) have hamstrung their own ability to do good.\n\nThis is a familiar diagnosis. It was the subject of two books just last month: Marc Dunkelman's historically rich Why Nothing Works: Who Killed Progress-and How to Bring It Back and Yoni Appelbaum's more focused Stuck: How the Privileged and the Propertied Broke the Engine of American Opportunity . But neither of those authors has the star power to ditch publishing's de rigueur explanatory subtitle, a choice that crystallizes this book's ambition. This book is not an idle account; it is open in its aims to drive changes in Democratic strategy.\n\nGovernment failure can be separated into three categories. First are the cases where our laws have been captured by narrow interest groups to the obvious detriment of the public good. One such case is the straitjacket of \"not in my backyard,\" or NIMBY, policies that have frozen many neighborhoods in amber over the past 50 years. One of the more compelling examples of the abundance agenda in action is the opposing YIMBY movement, for \"yes in my backyard.\" Over the past decade, pro-housing activists have blitzed city councils and statehouses with popular, commonsense bills that permit more neighbors to move in, prevailing over the objections of a few local homeowners. Democrats from AOC to Barack Obama have embraced the cause.\n\nSecond, there are the cases where government sluggishness is the deliberate result of smothering the administrative state beneath blankets of foolproof rules. Thanks to Klein's background as a crack health care reporter, this book is strongest in its critique of complicated grant applications, notice-and-comment rulemaking, procurement box-checking, endless committees, and frequent court challenges that dog government action and interaction. \"The American innovation system would benefit from trusting individuals more and bureaucracies less,\" Klein and Thompson write. Many of these checks and balances have their roots in liberal suspicion of government, but today this risk-aversion strategy impedes Democrats' effective exercise of power at all levels.\n\nWhen these checks are circumvented-often in an emergency-the results are striking. Consider how Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro managed to rebuild a collapsed section of Interstate 95 in Philadelphia in just 12 days. Under an emergency declaration, state Transportation Secretary Mike Carroll was able to forgo an environmental assessment and a traditional bidding process, enlisting two unionized contractors who happened to be working nearby. It was a triumph: Shapiro was celebrated for showing that government could still get things done, and wrote that the first lesson was to \"empower strong leadership\" that could (legally) decide which customs to follow and which to ignore, and subsequently accept credit or blame for those choices.\n\nThird, and most challenging, are the many instances where the administrative bottlenecks to abundance represent distinct interests of the Democratic coalition. Unions, for example, reasonably support wage requirements for the workers who build public buildings and Buy America mandates for the equipment on public transit systems. Accessibility requirements for affordable multifamily housing represent a civil rights victory for Americans with disabilities. Contracting preference for women or minority-owned businesses speaks for itself.\n\nIn a 2021 column, Klein memorably described liberals' tendency to weigh down policy with other priorities as the \"everything-bagel problem\"-put too many things on the bagel, and it becomes a black hole from which nothing can escape. The expression has circulated widely since. It's in untangling these trade-offs that the rubber meets the road for abundance policy. \"To unmake this machine will be painful,\" the authors note. \"It will require questioning treasured nostrums and splitting old alliances.\"\n\nThe book falls short of delineating which alliances to split-a choose-your-own-Bluesky-pile-on awaits for every politician who appears on the Ezra Klein Show . But there are lessons from pop psychology, where decades of gurus have pitted the \"abundance mindset\" against the \"scarcity mindset.\" Many actors in American society, our president most of all, take as a first principle that the size of the economic pie is limited. Trade unions cling to outdated staffing rules on the assumption that there is a limited amount of work to go around. White-collar professionals like doctors and dentists protect their turf with occupational licensing laws and educational requirements. Small-business owners cling to a parking spot outside the shop because they cannot imagine that new customers might arrive from a new apartment building across the street. For abundance to take hold, the thought that life could be better-as the poet said-must be woven, indelibly, into their hearts and their brains.\n\nIn its rejection of this zero-sum thinking, what makes \"abundance\" different from the old pro-growth liberalism of America in its midcentury boom years-itself already the subject of, among other studies, a 2007 book called The Age of Abundance ? As in many theories of politics, the key is: more good things and fewer bad things.\n\nAt midcentury, the nation built an abundance of urban expressways and manufactured an ocean of disposable plastics-maybe let's leave those behind. Then came millennial consumer abundance: near-universal access to cheap meat, fast fashion, and addictive screens. It turns out not everything about that is great either.\n\nThis time around, Klein and Thompson suggest, our abundance focus should be on housing, transportation, energy, and health-who could argue for less? But some conflicts lie down that road as well. The most popular policy use of the word abundance in recent years has been in a Republican talking point: energy abundance . That means continuing to burn coal, gas, and oil. Abundance is not a replacement for a value system. You need to know what you want and don't want before you ask for more.\n\nIf there's an elephant in the abundance room, it's the Republican Party. Donald Trump and his followers are basically absent from what amounts to a liberal intervention. Where the GOP does appear in Abundance , it is in a handful of maddeningly framed \"both sides\" phrases: \"Liberals might detest the language that Trump and Vance use to demonize immigrants. But blue America practices its own version of scarcity politics.\" (Jane Jacobs never sent anyone to Guantánamo for sporting a Michael Jordan tattoo .) Or: \"We are stuck between a progressive movement that is too afraid of growth and a conservative movement that is allergic to government intervention.\" (That is not the first way I would characterize our current \"conservative movement.\") But perhaps it's for the best: Who knows what the GOP stands for these days, besides Trump's latest whim? At least if Dems can solve problems in blue states, they might be able to pitch a national Project 2029 to voters. The work of \"institutional renewal\" has never seemed more urgent.\n\nThe book's core lesson, convincingly delivered, is that liberals ought to make it easier to do the things they want to do. \"What is scarce that should be abundant?\" Klein and Thompson write. \"What is hard to build that should be easy?\" Identifying the goals is often difficult; putting them into practice shouldn't be. This will alienate some constituencies and lead to some embarrassing mistakes. But the result will be, well, results . Imagine if, in three years, voters could look to New York, California, or Massachusetts and say with pride: This is what democracy looks like.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The One Thing Democrats Need to Embrace to Survive\n\nAmerican democracy is in peril. We won't know the exact margin of victory for some time, but the shape of the presidential contest is clear enough this morning to warrant a few basic conclusions. Donald Trump won a close but decisive victory over Kamala Harris in an election where national discontent carried the day amid record voter turnout. Trump will take office in January with an ultraconservative majority on the Supreme Court, a Republican majority in the Senate, and a likely GOP majority in the House. The era of polarized political conflict in America is not over and will surely escalate in the months to come.\n\nThe Harris campaign will receive plenty of intraparty criticism for the loss, but the widespread nature of Trump's gains suggests an electorate broadly unhappy with the incumbent party rather than a faulty campaign strategy. Although detailed demographic data is still developing, Trump improved on his 2020 performance in rural, urban, and suburban counties, in red states and in blue states, and with white voters as well as Latino voters. President Joe Biden is the most unpopular sitting president since Harry Truman . His vice president could not escape his political gravity.\n\nAnyone reading this website recognizes the tremendous consequence of the Harris defeat. Trump spent the campaign demonizing immigrants and repeatedly discussed turning the American military on leading Democratic Party politicians. His own former chief of staff has described him as a \"fascist,\" and over the summer, the Supreme Court shielded Trump from prosecution for any crimes committed in the course of \"official acts\" as president. The past eight years offer little reason to hope that leaders in the Republican Party will check Trump's most reckless impulses, and every reason to expect Trump support from billionaires and big business. The best Democrats can hope for over the next four years is chronic dysfunction and administrative incompetence. The worst is frightening to contemplate.\n\nIncumbent political parties are struggling across the world . Liberal and conservative governments on multiple continents have been suffering electoral setbacks over the past year as they grapple with a variety of global economic dislocations in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Japan has slipped in and out of recession , while Europe is plagued by weak growth . The U.S. economy remains very strong-the envy of the developed world, with inflation tamed, growth robust, and the best labor market in 50 years. But voters have consistently reported economic dissatisfaction in surveys all year.\n\nThe country is plainly unhappy, whatever the metrics say, and none of the Harris campaign's appeals to democracy, personal character, or abortion rights were enough to secure gains for her among the constituencies the campaign targeted. No rush of suburban women for Harris materialized; no apostate Republican bloc followed Liz Cheney into the Harris camp. Trump even appears to have enjoyed a surge of support among Latino voters as he championed mass deportations.\n\nTrump's was a campaign of raw anger, and voters across the country rewarded him for it. Americans have been living in an era of political anger since the bank bailouts of 2008, but the Democratic Party has not. Its legislative successes-Obama's health care law, Biden's green tech investments-have been narrow procedural affairs, negotiated through mastery of Capitol Hill process rather than the mobilization of public energy and emotion. Anger will remain the dominant currency of American politics in a second Trump term, as Trump nurtures the very forces leading to so much anxiety and instability. Silicon Valley billionaires will pad their profits by spewing hate online, various parts of our government will be effectively up for sale to lobbyists and contractors, oppressive regimes abroad will be emboldened to attack their neighbors, and Trump himself will relentlessly attack journalists.\n\nIn difficult times, optimism is a duty, not an indulgence . Imperiled as it is, American democracy is not dead. Trump was a profoundly unpopular president, and will be again. There will be political battles worth fighting and political victories to be won if the Democratic Party can reshuffle the demographic deck. The trend across the 21 st century has been for Democrats to consolidate advantages with college-educated voters while losing support among voters without a college degree. That can't continue in a country where most voters don't graduate from college.\n\nI don't know how much of that process has to do with actual policy commitments. Trump's vacuous, victorious campaign offers little evidence that voters are responding directly to policy ideas. But Democrats will have to find a way to channel the prevailing public anger instead of attempting to bypass or assuage it. Angry people don't have much faith in win-win outcomes-somebody has to lose for them to win. Democrats need to learn how to craft political narratives with active villains who must be held accountable. Trump defines his coalition by defining his enemies-he hates immigrants, so if you're not an immigrant, he's on your team.\n\nWhere Trump offers cheap scapegoating, Democrats must instead revive a politics of public accountability. Throughout the 21 st century, Democrats have practiced a deep aversion to open conflict with bad actors. Obama did not even bother to pardon the torturers from the George W. Bush administration, eventually working to suppress reports of the CIA's \"enhanced interrogation\" operations. After the financial crisis of 2008, banker bonuses were protected with public funds, while plainly criminal financial conduct went unprosecuted as the bank crash delivered the worst recession since the Great Depression. In Trump's first term, Nancy Pelosi shrank from confronting him over obvious misconduct.\n\nIn each of these iterations, party leaders issued vague political considerations, fearing to alienate Republicans in the public at large. But at a certain point, the pattern looks like a simple fear of confrontation itself. Democratic leaders could not even bring themselves to move an obviously diminished Joe Biden out of the race until it was too late, instead attempting to deceive the public about the state of his decline while hoping for the best. The public feels stripped of agency, subjected to social forces beyond its control, from the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, to the financial crisis to the COVID-19 crash. By refusing to defend basic accountability, Democrats have deepened the very divides they hoped to paper over.\n\nDemocrats insist they are fighting for democracy and the public interest, but they have a hard time defining whom and what they are fighting against . It's time to figure that out. The future of democracy depends on it.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Democrats in Congress Will Soon Be Able to Actually Do Something to Pressure Trump\n\nSign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nThe phones in Democratic offices on Capitol Hill have been ringing off the hook. As President Donald Trump and his revolutionaries blitz through the federal government at a speed unprecedented in recent times, Democratic constituents are pleading with their representatives to do something about it all.\n\nWhat can Democrats do to push back against Trump? Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer sorts their efforts into several buckets: oversight, litigation, communication and mobilization, and legislation. The first several fronts, between the regular petitions for temporary restraining orders, press conferences, protests outside government buildings, or drawing out votes on nominees, have been daily efforts. It's that last tool of pushback-their votes in Congress-that won't really be deployed until mid-March.\n\nFunding for the government expires March 14. Republicans will need Democratic votes to keep the government open. They'll need Democratic votes in the Senate to surmount the 60-vote filibuster threshold, and they'll need Democratic votes in the House, where the narrow Republican majority is a mess.\n\nIn theory, then, the deadline will give Democrats their first leverage point to put some brakes on the executive branch. But it's easy to overestimate and overstate the extent of their leverage, and it's a hand they can overplay. Neither this funding fight nor the next one is going to be the moment they turn the tide against the Trump administration. That was, is, and will remain a slog.\n\nBipartisan spending deals are always difficult to negotiate. Adding a new layer of complication to this next round is that Democrats can't be sure the Trump administration will spend the hard-earned dollars Democrats negotiate in a deal. It's not just that the administration's actions so far make the negotiations themselves, or the lack thereof, an unusually theoretical exercise. They also give Democrats, whose base is livid, less political space to work with Republicans at all.\n\nRepublicans in Congress are still a long way from asking Democrats what they need, and Democrats a long way from formalizing their ask. But Democratic leaders are thinking in terms of arresting Elon Musk's assault on federal agencies. When Schumer was asked at a press conference Tuesday whether he would fight for language to protect the U.S. Agency for International Development and the freshly gutted Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, for example, he said: \"In terms of trying to get in the appropriations bills undoing lots of the many things that they've done that are wrong, yes, we're certainly going to make an effort to do that.\"\n\nThis is a bit of an odd promise: It's already the law that the president can't refuse to distribute congressionally appropriated funds. What are Democrats going to do-add language that they, and the Constitution, really mean it this time ? Maybe they could add some explicit language requiring certain numbers of employees at the hacksawed agencies. But ... if Trump ignored it once, why wouldn't he just do so again? Whatever Democrats do, this won't be settled until the Supreme Court rules in the showdowns over executive power that Trump has been cueing up.\n\nAgain: not the most fertile grounds for good-faith negotiations.\n\nDemocrats, for now, are working to put the ball in Republicans' court: Republicans run the government, and it's their responsibility to fund the government. \"Here's the bottom line,\" Schumer said Tuesday. \"The Republicans are already shutting down good chunks of the government. Democrats don't want to shut down, but it's in Republicans' hands; it's up to them.\" New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , meanwhile, said, \"It is the Republican majority's responsibility to gather the votes necessary for them to pass their agenda,\" while House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries emphasized that Republicans \"control the House, the Senate, and the presidency. It's their government.\"\n\nThe message here is that Republicans would be blamed for any shutdown since they're the governing party, and also because Republicans are, in fact, to blame for most of the shutdowns we've had in recent years. But not all of them.\n\nIt's little remembered, but Senate Democrats filibustered a funding bill in January 2018-when they were similarly locked out of power-because they couldn't attach to it protections for recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. It lasted only a weekend, because Democrats quickly realized they'd be blamed for the shutdown and decided to cut their losses. Because that's how culpability for government shutdown works: The party making the policy demand takes the blame. And holding out longer only digs that party further into a hole.\n\nLet's say there's a situation in which Democrats and Republicans can't reach a deal by March 14, and Republicans put a bill on the floor to extend current funding levels for some duration, maybe even months . It's hard to see Democrats, especially their swing-seat members, staying unified enough to block that on the grounds that it ignores their demands to offer more protections for threatened federal agencies. Because that argument, right now, may not be a winner .\n\nThe deadline, then, may give Democrats their first real leverage point, and the temptation to stockpile a laundry list of demands is understandable. But it's not the strongest element in their tool kit. Litigation, by contrast, is the most immediate way to block Trump's most brazen efforts to unilaterally remake the federal government. And communicating how such changes would negatively affect people's lives is the long-term means of turning public opinion against the president's agenda.\n\nThat includes, by the way, messaging about the separate legislative effort that the GOP, all on its own, will be in the thick of by mid-March: predictably trading trillions in tax cuts for cuts to Medicaid and food stamps . If Republicans want to overplay their hand, there's no reason to get in their way.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Democrats Had a Chance to Take a Stand Here. What Went Wrong?\n\nListen to What Next:\n\nSign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nWhen Mary Harris got Talking Points Memo founder Josh Marshall on the phone on Sunday, she had one simple question for him: Do you think the government should be open right now?\n\nHis answer was no-that Senate Democrats should have taken a stand against Donald Trump's lawlessness and withheld the votes Republicans needed to keep the government from shutting down. Even one single Democrat could have made more of a stink and slowed things down.\n\nNow, for better or worse, the government is open-but the struggle within the party over how to handle a potential shutdown revealed divisions that may be with us for quite some time. On Monday's episode of What Next , Harris spoke with Marshall about the mindset that led Democrats to give up a rare moment of leverage.\n\nHere's their conversation, lightly edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nTell me what happened in the House, where this legislation began. We have this GOP-crafted bill. Democrats weren't consulted on any of it, basically.\n\nYeah, by design, they weren't consulted on it. There was some initial negotiation. And Democrats basically said, look, if we are going to pass this kind of mini stopgap budget bill, we need some assurances that Donald Trump is not going to turn around and just cut the budget after we pass it. Mike Johnson realized that was a total nonstarter for Donald Trump to put any limitations on his power, so they just said: Fine, we're just going to do this ourselves. And they included a number of additional things that, under normal circumstances, would be poison pills for the Democrats.\n\nIs this stuff like slashing Washington, D.C.'s budget, things like that?\n\nSlashing Washington, D.C.'s budget. It added a lot of additional spending for things Republican support. Cuts for things that Democrats support. There's sort of too many things to get into. But just as one example: Everybody knows that Donald Trump is imposing tariffs, un-imposing them, imposing bigger ones the next day. We've been doing this for the last month with these tariffs. Some people, because of that, get the idea that tariffs are like a pardon-one of these things that are just in the president's power, the Constitution gives him that power.\n\nTariffs are not like that at all. The president has no power over tariffs whatsoever. But there is standing legislation that has been in place for decades that basically gives presidents this power. And so in this bill, they put in additional language that takes away some of Congress' very, very limited power under current law to say no to some of these tariffs.\n\nSo this is not what's called, usually, a \"clean CR,\" where it's just, we're saying: We're going to do what we said we'd do for a few months and come back and talk about it later. This is: Let's give a lot more power to Donald Trump, but say that we're just doing it as a funding bill. Is that a fair assessment?\n\nExactly. It's nowhere near clean. A \"clean CR\"-a little code word they use for these kinds of bills-is one sentence. And this was like a 100-page bill. So yeah, it was not even close to being just a continuation.\n\nSo Hakeem Jeffries, the leader of the Democrats in the House, got a lot of his Democrats to vote against this bill, including Democrats in swing districts who were pretty vulnerable. It goes along to the Senate. Was he expecting the Senate would stand up here? Was there an agreement here?\n\nHow it is being presented now-how a lot of House Democrats are presenting this-is kind of what you're getting at: That they went out on a limb and then the Senate didn't back them up. I think that's part of the story. I'm not sure it's completely the story.\n\nThere's an expectation, but maybe not an agreement.\n\nI think they were all caught off guard by being here. And I think the House decided to hold the line, and then it's going to go to the Senate and we'll see what happens there.\n\nThe House is notably a much more vulnerable constituency of lawmakers. These are people who are up for election every two years. Unlike the Senate.\n\nPrecisely. And I think that the key thing here is that neither House nor Senate Democrats had laid the groundwork, if this was going to be a fight. And that was something that a lot of people were telling them to do. Like basically, a month ago, you need to be saying: You're doing all this illegal cutting. You think you can do it now, but we say no-and look at that deadline coming up, we're doing it for X, Y, and Z. But they didn't do that. And they had a sort of explanation why they didn't do that, but they didn't. And the Senate Democrats were especially caught flat-footed because they were figuring it wouldn't get out of the House. And there were some good reasons to think it wasn't going to get out of the House.\n\nBut you've gotta be prepared when the ball comes to you, my friend.\n\nIt is insane that they hadn't seriously thought through what they would do if it did get through the House.\n\nSo this legislation reaches the Senate. We have this weird week where you have, first, Schumer being like, We're not going to do it. And then it's clear: Eh, maybe we're going to do this, help the Republicans out here. And it all comes to a head on Friday, which is when this thing has to get done or the government will shut down.\n\nWhat surprised you as these votes started to come in? I think people suspected that this CR was going to get passed by the Senate-but then we had people like Hawaii's Brian Schatz voting for this CR, and that surprised me. He's been outspoken about using these spending fights as points of leverage because the Democrats need to show that we're fighting right now. And that's not what he did here.\n\nYeah, he is sort of the biggest mystery. I was greatly surprised by that, for exactly the reasons you're saying, and I still have not seen a clear explanation of why he did it. He's a fairly progressive senator. He's definitely someone who he spends time in the online political spaces, he sort of speaks that language. A number of the senators who voted yes were either people who are retiring or people who are extremely close to the leadership. Gillibrand obviously is the junior senator from New York, so she's kind of always going to take Chuck Schumer's lead. Basically almost everybody who voted yes has a similar kind of profile in the Senate, and Schatz was the big exception.\n\nCan we take seriously the arguments Democrats were making against shutting down the government and for this continuing resolution? Because Chuck Schumer did try to explain his logic here. He mostly seemed to be saying: If we shut the government down, Donald Trump is going to have power to control spending, for whatever money is left. He could just start shutting all sorts of things down willy-nilly, which would be incredibly damaging. Is that the main argument here?\n\nI think there's two arguments. One is that you shut the government down and the Democrats will get the blame for it-a political argument. And the other is that, as bad as things are right now, you're just sort of handing him a blank check. I think those two arguments were real arguments. I don't think they were good arguments.\n\nBut there's an additional factor, which is: What is the argument that we were actually going to get something from it? And if you take each of those premises-like we could be damaged politically, the government could be damaged more than it already is being damaged, and there's no way we can actually gain anything-well, again, if you buy those premises, then that's not a bad argument altogether. I don't think that the people who wanted to do this were lying. I think that characterologically, they weren't in a mood to fight.\n\nYeah, because I think you could take the same set of facts and you could make a different argument, which is an argument I'd call an accelerationist argument. Essentially that, yes, Trump and Elon Musk may do worse things during this shutdown, but that will make clear to a broader swath of Americans exactly the project that they are trying to complete here, sooner. And that will make it easier for us to argue against them and control them more quickly. Now, you're playing with fire-there's a reason it's called an accelerationist argument, right? But I think it's a real argument that you need to reckon with.\n\nYeah, and I think it is actually the correct argument. I wouldn't put it in precisely accelerationist terms. How I would put it is: In terms of the idea that they can just do anything they want and they can do even more-it's not entirely clear that is actually factually true, inasmuch as that they're kind of already doing everything they want. But public opinion remains a backstop to that. And one of my kind of global arguments would be that the people who did not want to fight about this are very over-literal about things.\n\nWhat do you mean by that?\n\nI think that much of national politics is not about specific events or policies. It's about a series of contests of performative power. It's sort of like, if anybody is familiar with opera, there's the libretto and there's the score. The libretto is the policy stuff, and these little ins and outs about cloture and stuff. And the libretto, you know-I'm gonna bum out libretto fans-the libretto is not really what opera is about. It's the score. That is the emotional content and the real driving force of opera. And the score in this case is, again, these performative displays of power. And if you have situations where the underdogs-let's call them that-if the one opening they have to fight, they don't fight, that shapes everybody's perceptions of everything.\n\nLike whether they even can fight.\n\nYes, exactly.\n\nSo you're saying your job, if you're a politician, is to tell people they can fight, they have a voice.\n\nAnd that your fighting can shape outcomes. Even if the details are hard to see.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Democrats, You Have to Do Better Than This\n\nBased on the Democrats' personnel decisions and public statements, you'd have no idea the party lost control of all three branches of government last week. Literal congratulations have been doled out for tough losses in a near-impossible electoral environment, for a spirited effort amid utter defeat. It's almost as if Democratic leadership hadn't spent the entire fall projecting publicly that the electoral environment was tight but winnable.\n\nNow that it's clear they were wrong, there has been basically zero accountability. No real reckoning from the Democratic National Committee on how it managed to spend $1 billion on the only Democratic presidential popular vote loss in 20 years. No apologies from Sen. Chuck Schumer and other members of leadership for embracing the crypto industry , which promptly turned around and spent tens of millions of dollars against Democrats in tight races, including the all-important Ohio Senate race, which Dems lost. No introspective messaging about losing not just the presidency but the Senate and the House.\n\nAnd apparently, not even any high-level discussion of a change in strategy. This week, when the House Democratic Caucus met for the first time since Election Day, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and other high-ranking members delivered \"what attendees described as a celebratory message despite the odds,\" according to Politico's Nicholas Wu. Another Politico reporter, Daniella Diaz, posted on X that the meeting was \"a pep rally so far.\"\n\nThis messaging strikes largely the same note as what Democratic leadership has said in public.\n\nHouse Rep. Jim Clyburn said on CBS News , \"We ought to just chill out for a while ... don't worry about blaming anybody.\"\n\nJeffries told MSNBC : \"We can't be hysterical in our assessment that this was some anti-incumbent wave.\"\n\nAnd Nancy Pelosi, who is no longer in a leadership role (but is very clearly a shadow leader of the party), insisted to the New York Times that \"House members did very well.\" Refusing even a hint of introspection, she added: \"We don't agonize over what happened. We organize about what comes next.\"\n\nIs losing doing very well? If now is not the time to agonize over what happened, to identify failures and act with urgency-with Donald Trump, post-insurrection, sweeping back into Washington with control of all three chambers (plus his handpicked judiciary)-when is it?\n\nTo be sure, there will be better data about the election results within the coming months. But this was a pretty thorough drubbing. Despite an assurance that the election postmortems in the House would start with a handful of \"listening sessions ,\" there is no indication that any members of leadership will step down or face any challenge to their posts. Jeffries eventually told House Democrats \"the buck stops with me,\" but according to Axios , \"everyone shouted 'no' \" in response.\n\nIt's not unsurprising that a Republican victory at the top of the ticket would come in tandem with a Republican Senate and a Republican gain in the House. But this is shaping up to be the third straight cycle that Democrats have lost or not gained House seats. (The election is not quite over but at current count, the best-case scenario looks like 214 Democratic seats, which is exactly how many they had when New Jersey Democrat Bill Pascrell died in office at age 87 in late August.) Democrats put up a net loss even when Biden won the presidency in 2020, shedding 14 seats and shrinking their House majority to a minuscule four-seat advantage, kneecapping the Biden agenda. They put up another net loss in 2022, in the same electoral environment where Senate Democrats managed a net gain, dropping to a five-seat deficit, which effectively ended the legislative ambitions of the Biden administration altogether.\n\nSome more conservative members of the Democratic Party are taking this as an opportunity to punch out at their left-leaning colleagues: Rahm Emanuel, speaking to Puck News, diagnosed the issue with Democrats as a lack of comfort in using the term \"illegal alien,\" a culture war fight 20 years settled. One of Democrats' biggest demographic collapses was with voters under 30, but it's because liberals can't say \"illegals\"? You have to try better than that.\n\nEmanuel is not a member of leadership; he's currently serving as ambassador to Japan. But his knee-jerk response underscores one of the biggest themes of this past Democratic primary season: high-profile Democrats standing quietly by while outside groups spent tens of millions of dollars to drive out left-leaning members who were closely allied with activist and youth movement groups. (The Squad lost several members of its coalition, including both Black Lives Matter activists who had ridden the movement into Congress.) Was driving youth candidates out of the caucus a successful way to drive up youth enthusiasm? Or are we sure about that unwillingness to say \"illegal alien\"?\n\nIt's worth noting, too, that only one member of the Democratic House leadership triad is not a stalwart moderate, Minority Whip Katherine Clark. The House leadership trio that passed the leadership baton after 2022: all moderates. And now moderates, after undercutting the Biden legislative agenda and steering the campaign ship away from progressives and into the rocks, are insisting that the problem is ... not enough moderates. Somehow, the highest-profile resignation after the election washout remains the head of the Texas Democratic Party.\n\nThe current signal that is being sent by Democratic leaders is that elections are really hard, and that this-what just happened-is good enough. That messaging may be comforting for Democratic consultants and elected officials, but it's probably not enough for Democratic voters, who would no doubt prefer to see their politicians, who they have donated money to and knocked doors for, prioritize winning. As one now-ignominious outgoing Democratic lifer would put it: C'mon, man!\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

How should the party respond to its decisive second loss to Donald Trump, who left office in 2021 with the lowest approval rating of all time?\n\nOne answer that seems to be coming resoundingly from Barack Obama-era veterans is a return to Obama-style politics. That was made clearest in an uproar-raising episode of Pod Save America , which featured 90 minutes of Kamala Harris' four most senior campaign directors talking about what went wrong to contribute to Harris' defeat.\n\nThe very long conversation was dominated by former Obama 2008 campaign manager David Plouffe and Obama 2012 deputy campaign manager Stephanie Cutter-both of whom came off the bench to helm Harris' campaign after Biden dropped out-talking with Dan Pfeiffer, who took over Plouffe's old job as a senior adviser to Obama. Jen O'Malley Dillon and Quentin Fulks, both of whom were on the Biden and Harris campaigns, were present, too. To round things out, Jon Lovett, Jon Favreau, and Tommy Vietor, the hosts of Pod Save America , also all worked in the Obama White House.\n\nIn short, this was the Obama wing of the Democratic Party talking to itself, and what did it find? Herein lies the controversy: Those campaign stalwarts found that, by and large, they did a great job on Harris' campaign, that the race was basically unwinnable, that frustrated Democratic voters-who can't believe that they got swept by the least popular president in American history-are being unfair and uncharitable to the strategists' efforts in what was a very compressed campaign season.\n\nThis, despite the fact that the Harris campaign parlayed a truly unbelievable $1.5 billion, a massive cash advantage, into the first Democratic popular vote loss in 20 years. Harris was unable to move one single state in her direction (all 50 went more toward Trump than in 2020), and, according to pollster Patrick Ruffini, the first since 1932 to not flip a single county .\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic vote share collapsed in blue strongholds, as base Democratic turnout dipped substantially. That comes as no surprise, as seemingly the entire campaign was pitched toward courting mythical right-leaning moderate voters, a very Obama-style political maneuver. This was the justification for Harris spending so many days on the campaign trail with Republican Liz Cheney. Harris did perform better in those swing states where she campaigned and spent lavishly than in those places where she did not, but those Nikki Haley-voting Republicans simply did not materialize in winning numbers.\n\nYes, there were tough headwinds; incumbent political leaders all over the globe lost in record numbers this year. But as the New York Times reported in the days before the election, the Harris campaign's affiliated super PAC was alarmed by senior Harris campaign staff's insistence on focusing so intensely on Trump's character and warning of his fascist tendencies in the final stretch. That decency message-a very Obama-style flourish-was being favored over a more pugilistic, economic-policy-forward message. \"Purely negative attacks on Trump's character are less effective than contrast messages that include positive details about Kamala Harris's plans to address the needs of everyday Americans,\" an email from the super PAC read.\n\nWhen the campaign tapped Obama himself to hit the trail, he leaned so far into the decency messaging that he set about scolding Black male voters who dared not vote for Harris. As a demographic group, Black men went on to nearly double their support for Trump over 2020.\n\nThe failure of the \"Trump Is Bad\" approach implicates Pod Save America, too. According to nearly every campaign postmortem, the ecosystem of sort of sloppy right-wing podcasts played a critical role in elevating Trump, swamping the influence of the podcast which is the brightest beacon of Obama-style politics, and-in an ideal world-would have figured as the Democratic answer in this media environment. The Pod Save America episode with the Harris staffers was met with a firestorm of criticism online from commenters and journalists who bristled at the self-satisfied tone and lack of soul-searching. Needless to say, the pod did not save America.\n\nThe results are clear: The Democrats need to do something really different. And yet the Obama wing of the party, which basically took over Harris' campaign, now insists that the only solution is a return to even more Obama-style politics: more moderation, an embrace of big money and friendlier dealings with Wall Street and Silicon Valley, and a less combative stance toward Republicans. It's the line of thinking that led Harris to refuse to commit to keeping President Joe Biden's Federal Trade Commission chair Lina Khan, who has gone after Big Tech and Big Pharma-or just hammer corporate greed in any way, at all. This was a clear break from the Biden presidency.\n\n\"We have to dominate the moderate vote,\" said Plouffe on the podcast, of his prescription for the future. \"And I think as we look ahead towards '26 and '28 ... we obviously have to get some of that back, we can't afford any more erosion there.\" Maybe I'm missing something, but the post-loss diagnosis sure seems like \"We did everything right\" and the post-loss prescription seems to be \"More of what we just did.\"\n\nDavid Axelrod, the former chief strategist on both the Obama 2008 and Obama 2012 campaigns, is pushing for the same thing. He recently began advocating for former Obama chief of staff Rahm Emanuel to be reinstated as the Democratic National Committee chair. Emanuel is perhaps best known for his willingness to go to war with the party's left flank, rather than Republicans, and his colorful contempt for unions.\n\nAnd yet, not even Emanuel himself seems to believe in the efficacy of Obama-era policy and politics. In a pretty stunning CNN interview this week, Emanuel went off on the legacy of policy decisions he and his former boss had a direct role in implementing.\n\n\"The Iraq War, in which the American people were deceived, spent trillions of dollars, thousands of soldiers lost their lives ... people were deceived and lied into a war and not one person responsible for that deception ever was held accountable,\" he said . \"Six years later, the financial industry lies to the American people, people lose their homes, their livelihoods, and the bankers are screaming for their bonuses. Nobody held accountable.\"\n\nOf course, it was the Obama administration, and Emanuel himself, that proudly chose the route of no accountability for these actors, for both the Iraq War and the financial crisis, stressing a need for comity with Republicans and Wall Street and a desire to turn the page.\n\nInterestingly, Harris campaign adviser Cutter built her national reputation as an adviser to Obama Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, where, according to the New York Times, \"she protected Geithner's fragile reputation and tried to spin unpopular policies like the Troubled Asset Relief Program and the A.I.G. bailout.\" The TARP program was perhaps the most scandalous bank bailout program of all, one that was meant to prevent the foreclosure crisis but ended up as a Wall Street bonanza rife with fraud, and did substantial damage to Americans' view of their own government.\n\nFor good reason, Democrats pine for the days of Obama where the top of the ticket was beloved by Americans. But Obama was a singular political talent, and going back to Obama-era political strategies won't solve the problems facing Obama-less Dems. While Obama himself cruised through two presidential elections, Democrats not named Obama got obliterated in that period: In the eight years he was president, the party lost a total of 15 state House chambers, 14 state Senate chambers, 960 state legislative seats, 10 governorships, 62 seats in Congress, and 11 seats in the Senate.\n\nPresident Biden, despite his profound personal unpopularity, almost certainly had the party closer to a winning program: his economic populist approach, his antitrust agenda, his embrace of unions, and his broader social spending were all taken up by the Trump campaign at some level, bespeaking an obvious popularity that was backed up by polling. This has not gone unnoticed by some of the biggest boosters of centrism. New York Times opinion columnist David Brooks recently posited that maybe \"in order to win working class votes in an era of high distrust, the Democrats have to do a lot of things that Bernie Sanders said they should do.\"\n\nThat tension over the future of the Democratic Party hasn't broken out into civil war yet. But it remains an unresolved issue, and those factions will begin battling it out more openly come January, when the next DNC chair is chosen.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

Republicans also regained control of the Senate, and while Democrats may still flip the House, it's looking bleak. But for liberals, Tuesday's election did manage to bring some small wins:\n\n• In North Carolina, Democrat Josh Stein won the governor's race , defeating the \" Black Nazi \" Mark Robinson. Stein will be the first Jewish governor in the state's history. Democrats also won every major executive branch race in the state.\n\n• Democrat Sarah McBride won her race to represent Delaware in the House, becoming the first openly transgender person to be elected to Congress.\n\n• While Florida's abortion rights ballot measure failed , most of the states that were deciding on abortion rights amendments voted in favor of them . Even in Missouri, the first state to ban abortion after Roe v. Wade fell, residents voted for an amendment to enshrine abortion rights.\n\n• Democrat Angela Alsobrooks beat out Republican Larry Hogan for the Maryland Senate race, meaning there will be two Black women in the Senate for the first time ever . Democrat Lisa Blunt Rochester also won her race in Delaware, where she'll be the first woman, and the first Black American, to represent the state in the Senate. Together, they double the number of Black women ever elected to the chamber.\n\n• New Jersey elected Democrat Andy Kim to the Senate ; he will be the first Korean American to serve as a senator, taking over the seat vacated by Bob Menendez. He is also the first Asian American senator the state has elected.\n\n• Fani Willis, the Fulton County district attorney who has been prosecuting Trump for his attempts to overturn the 2020 election, was reelected .\n\n• Democrat Monique Worrell won her seat back as a state attorney in Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis had previously pushed her out.\n\n• The state of Washington voted to keep its aggressive Climate Commitment Act, which requires companies to cut carbon emissions.\n\n• In Illinois, voters overwhelmingly approved a measure recommending mandatory insurance coverage for IVF and approved a referendum to create a new tax bracket for those who make more than $1 million.\n\n• Elon Musk cannot be president .\n\nRead all of Slate's coverage of the 2024 election.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Slate's guide to the most important figures in politics this week.\n\nWelcome to this week's edition of the Surge, which welcomes Mr. Trump to his rightful place on the throne! Ha ha ha, very good, sir! (Disclaimer: Surge Enterprises LLC has large contracts- spaceships and so forth-before the federal government.)\n\nLast week, we wrote : \"There's going to be a polling error, it's mostly going to go in one direction, and the candidate who's been underestimated could win by a comfortable Electoral College margin.\" And here we are.\n\nInstead of ranking human beings this week (except for one), we're breaking containment and ranking takeaways from the election. Or, rather, the biggest factors in the election. No: stray thoughts. You'll see.\n\nLet's begin with a homily from former President Barack Obama : Anybody gone into Whole Foods lately and see what they charge for arugula?\n\nBy Jim Newell\n\nThe No. 1 issue in the election this year was the economy, which most people think is bad, even if a number of macroeconomic indicators-which can go to hell-suggest that it's doing pretty well. The long tail of the COVID pandemic has taken incumbents out across the globe this year, and it took one out in our fair country too. How much blame for this can be ascribed to the Biden administration? About 1 to 3 percentage points , based on the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan that Democrats passed when they took office in 2021, while the underlying trend stemmed from COVID-induced shocks. It raised costs at grocery stores-as so many campaign ads pointed out-but also put homeownership out of reach for many and sent interest rates soaring. In the Surge's personal experience, beyond personal goods, every service, like car repairs, seemed to cost twice as much and take twice as long. Granted, we work in an industry (federally procured rocket construction and production, aside) that's in permanent financial decline and never quite got to experience the supposedly perfect economy of 2019, fond memories of which helped put Trump back in office. But the administration was dealt a horrible hand, made worse on the margins by policy choices. And now an aw-shucks Pennsylvania fry cook has taken control of the country.\n\nThe Surge wrote about this at length in a separate piece , but: Large majorities of the country, Democrat and Republican alike, had decided by 2022 that Joe Biden shouldn't run for president again on account of his clearly deteriorating physical and mental fitness for office. (We know: Doesn't seem to have been an issue for the other guy.) Anecdotally, the Surge will say that the No. 1 question we'd get in stray conversation, beyond \"Is Trump going to win again?,\" was \"Is Biden actually going to run again?\" And so he did, until the whole edifice came crumbling down following a shocking June debate. This left Kamala Harris little time to stand up a campaign and message, or to discover who she was as a candidate beyond someone who's just trying too hard not to screw up. Had Biden announced at the beginning of the cycle that he wouldn't seek a second term, Democrats could've run a full-field primary, and maybe a skilled candidate who wasn't hamstrung by the administration's unpopularity, or a more battle-tested Kamala Harris, could've emerged. Or maybe this election was over from the get-go! We don't know! Leave us alone! We're just spitballing alternative-history takes here while we await our bountiful tip-jar tax breaks and tariff lucre.\n\nDemocrats are going to need an infusion of electoral votes over the following decade to make up for those lost in anchor states like California, New York, and Illinois in the next census. That means they could have looked to Texas, which progressively got bluer each cycle through 2020, when Biden lost it by only 5.5. points. But then Harris lost it by 14 points on Tuesday, and the shifts along the southern border-with large Latino communities-were sharp . Webb County, home to Laredo, went 25 points more Republican than in 2020. Hidalgo County, home to McAllen, went 20 points more Republican. Starr County, which had voted Democratic since 1896 , went 21 points more Republican and into Trump's column . El Paso County stayed blue but went 20 points in Trump's direction. These counties didn't move in that direction just because of the border-see, again, the first entry . But this is a look, from one of many angles, at the damage that the Biden administration's mismanagement of the border has done to both the Democratic Party and support for immigration itself nationally , in blue states and red, rural America and cities, among a broad range of demographic groups-including even people who could be deported ! Look beyond Texas and other, sharply redder border states to the reddened California and New York City . Ignoring the issue until a few months before election time wasn't going to do the trick. We suspect that some of this sharp rightward shift on immigration will revert if Trump actually does execute \"mass deportations\" in a ruthless way. But Democrats did major damage to their credibility on this issue over the past four years. If people don't think you'll solve a problem, they'll hire someone who will-even if, or because, he's an asshole.\n\nRepublicans up and down the ballot spent hundreds of millions of dollars on network TV ads bashing Democrats over transgender issues-trans women in women's sports, gender-neutral bathrooms, and so on. The ads we'll remember most were those from the Trump campaign showing Harris boasting, during her 2020 presidential run, about providing transition surgery to inmates . \"Kamala is for they/them,\" the ad-famously, we think-concludes. \"President Trump is for you.\" A few takeaways on this. First, when Harris entered the race, we wondered which particular left-wing sound bite that Harris offered during her doomed 2020 campaign would come back to bite her the most. We got our answer. Second, the ad campaign was effective not because millions of persuadable voters' top concern was that trans rights had gone too far. Instead, it was because it became the nugget the Trump campaign used to argue that Harris was culturally out of step with the country. Third, Democrats clearly need a better answer for Republican attacks on trans issues going forward-either moving right on these issues, or better explaining why they believe that it would be wrong and cruel to move right on these issues. Hiding from the conversation isn't tenable.\n\nDemocrats have much bigger media problems than the New York Times' sometimes using imprecise adjectives in its stories about Trump. The media environment is more diffuse than ever, and right-wing media has flourished in ways that Democrats are only beginning to grasp. It's not just Fox News, or Newsmax, or the New York Post. It's any number of YouTube streams, Twitch streams, content-creator feeds, alternative social media networks, mainstream social media networks. The amount of unrendered conspiratorial shit we've seen in past months about what \"they\" would do to steal the election from Trump \"again\"-not much, apparently!-has been breathtaking. And here's the key point: It's been unanswered, or answered only in forums that those susceptible to it will never see. We listened to some of Elon Musk's appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast at the beginning of the week, in which Musk expounded on his belief-his knowledge !-that Democrats were importing \"illegal immigrants\" as voters to create permanent one-party rule and crush dissent. We don't think Rogan is a malevolent person, but he is credulous, and he was convinced. Harris had an opportunity to go on Rogan's podcast to counter this nonsense but opted not to due to Rogan's logistical demands. The conspiracy theory, we want to reiterate, went unanswered as it was blasted to millions of people. We don't have all the answers for how Democrats contend with this. But more often, they need to meet right-wing listeners where they are to provide the counterpoint, even if doing so \"platforms\" figures they deem unworthy of their attention.\n\nThe Surge was at the Republican National Convention this summer, which began two days after Trump was nearly assassinated at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The general feeling exuding from that convention was that the attempt on Trump's life had sealed up the election for him. The party was unified, and Trump had taken on even more of a messianic image in the party-the would-be martyr, chosen by Providence. Well, here's what we'd tell those cocky, premature election-calling suckers now: Yeah, pretty much. The only question is whether the election was already sealed for Trump by then, given the factors discussed elsewhere in this newsletter. Trump got a meaningful and enduring favorability bump after the shooting, to unprecedented levels for him. He got a historic photo of a fist in the air to append to all his campaign marketing materials. He got the full support of Elon Musk and his resources, whether it was his money or the whirring misinformation machine that he owns. The Surge has often heard in the past month or two from media observers how it was odd that the assassination attempt drifted so quickly from the election discussion, overtaken by other flashy news, given that it was a major historical event. We don't believe that it did. It was one of the few campaign stories this year that broke through the noise in an important way.\n\nWe've been mean to the stupid idiot Democrats in this edition. Let's close out with some cope. Think about how, four years ago, Trump plummeted to an all-time low after he tried to overturn an election he lost, culminating in an attack on the place where elected officials were certifying the election. Think about two years ago, when he almost single-handedly mucked up a great midterms opportunity for Republicans. No one wanted anything to do with him. And today he's staffing up a new administration after the most successful Republican presidential election performance of the 21 st century. Things can change awfully quickly. Nothing is guaranteed, but there's a good chance Trump's second term goes off the rails instantly-and with it, public opinion . Democrats' coalitional gains among college-educated brownnosers puts them in good position for midterm turnout, while Trump's new coalition of podcast bros may be less inclined to show up to a voting booth to save Rep. Don Bacon yet again. Democrats have a strong presidential bench for 2028. By then, we'll be 13 years into the Trump era, and people may be sick, at last, of the whole thing. Maybe Dems don't have to change anything about themselves and they'll just win again. It worked for Trump.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC. All rights reserved."

      "text": "Democrats Can't Afford to Roll Over and Play Dead\n\nSign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nAs the Trump-Musk presidency continues to bulldoze its way through the federal government, American democracy, and the liberal world order , Democrats have been stunningly muted.\n\nThat may be by choice. In the New York Times, political strategist James Carville advised the party to \"roll over and play dead.\" On March 14, funding for the government will expire-and in their proposed new budget, Trump and his party are pushing tax cuts for the rich and Medicaid cuts for the poor. Shadow president Elon Musk is already energetically trying to hollow out the federal government, to the dismay of Americans who enjoy things like national parks , weather reports , and someone keeping an eye on the nukes . Republicans, Carville argues, are terrible at governing; let them show it.\n\nCarville is right that Republicans are indeed terrible at governing. He's right, too, that there isn't all that much Democrats can do to stop a budget from moving forward if Republicans collectively agree on it.\n\nBut they don't. The House budget negotiations were mucked up by GOP hard-liners, so much so that the Senate just went ahead and created its own budget proposal. Members of the House Freedom Caucus-the hard-liners-also wrote their own budget resolution .\n\nAnd so Democrats actually do have some power here, at least in their ability to very publicly and loudly assign blame, shift public opinion, and make clear that this Republican Party is both cruel and incompetent.\n\nMany of the actual policies pushed by the GOP are widely unpopular. Americans do not want Medicaid slashed so that billionaires can pay less in taxes: Only about 1 in 10 wants to reduce Medicaid spending, and most Americans actually say we aren't spending enough on the program. Americans don't want poor kids going hungry. They don't want to lose the basics they rely on, that they perhaps didn't even realize came courtesy of the feds-knowing if a literal tsunami is coming, for example.\n\nRepublicans are very good at promoting a top-line message: lower taxes, smaller government. But the actual details-lower taxes for the richest translating into fewer services and support systems for the middle class and the struggling, and a hobbled government that doesn't provide the nice things people are used to enjoying-are pretty bad.\n\nThis is true for much of the Trump agenda. \"Deporting illegals\" sounds good to a lot of people; the reality of sudden immigrant labor drain is shuttered restaurants, stalled construction projects, overcrowded child care centers, higher food prices, and no one to build your house. Making China pay for the loss of American manufacturing sounds nice; the reality is spiraling inflation and the sudden inability to afford cheap consumer goods. Making choices for your own body when it comes to vaccines and basic health care (but not abortion) is understandably appealing to MAHA misogynists, but the reality is measles outbreaks, kids paralyzed by polio, and women dying because of untreated miscarriages.\n\nIf you hear that a company is downsizing, do you think: Great, more efficiency! Or do you think: This means worker layoffs inside the company, and worse service for anyone outside it . Trump and Musk are using slash-and-burn tactics to radically downsize the federal government. And it's all of us who are going to live with the consequences.\n\nTrump won thanks to low-information voters who cast their ballots less on policy than on vibes. They liked that Trump and his MAGA movement seemed tough, that they would get stuff done. Now it turns out that they stuff they're getting done-the exact stuff they said they would do -is actually pretty bad. Democrats are utterly overestimating these voters if they assume they can let Republicans put the nation on a fast track to hell and only Republicans will get blamed for the heat.\n\nInstead, Democrats need to fight, even when they know they'll lose. They need to emulate Trump and MAGA in purpose, clarity, and righteousness. (Remember when House Republicans put on a big show of gumming up the gears during the Biden administration?) They need to fight out in the arena of public opinion, and they need to take Republicans to the mat on the Hill. Do Republicans need some Democratic votes? Fine. They'll get them when an unelected South African billionaire stops illegally dismantling one of the world's greatest nations and putting tens of thousands of Americans out of work. Until then, Democrats need to be clear: We're not helping launder the dirty work of this regime. In fact, we're going to air it all out.\n\nFighting doesn't mean obsessing over every detail or defending unpopular progressive positions. But it does mean winning the vibes war. This iteration of MAGA leaders loves to be bad, and while that can be exciting when you're in the opposition, it's harder to sustain while in power. Sure, it can be satisfying to watch antiheros triumph on TV. But do you really want them in charge of your health care?\n\nThe Democrats' task in this moment is to be the party that says: We Can Have Nice Things. It is to be nothing but appalled, contemptuous, and specific about what Republicans and Trump are doing. That family trip to the national park you had to cancel? That's Trump and his GOP. The eggs that are now a luxury grocery item? Trump and his GOP. A cratering stock market, your now shaky investments, your roof that you can't get anyone to fix? All Trump and his GOP.\n\nDemocrats are not fighting to win budget battles-they can't win there. But going through the motions of bipartisanship with a party that is intentionally breaking the nation isn't just stupid politics; it's reckless complicity. The public doesn't need Democrats to pretend they can win fights in which they are outnumbered. But it needs them to fight back using every tool in their arsenal, whether that's driving a hard deal in Congress or spending every spare minute on television and social media, telling voters exactly what their elephant overlords are doing.\n\nThe goal is not to win in the short term (that isn't happening). It's definitely not to assume you'll win by playing possum. The goal is to make sure the public knows what's going on-and knows that Democrats are the good guys at least trying to save the day.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Democrats Have a Problem With Religion. One Man Is Helping Fix It.\n\nThe Republican National Convention last month was teeming with God talk. Much of it was what we have come to expect from a party that cloaks itself in faith, even while worshipping its standard-bearer as a false idol. Tim Scott, speaking on the first night of the convention, described the attempt on former President Donald Trump's life like so: \"Our God still saves. He still delivers, and He still sets free. Because on Saturday, the devil came to Pennsylvania holding a rifle. But an American lion got back up on his feet, and he roared.\" U.S. Senate candidate Leora Levy offered a Jewish prayer for Trump , yet as she deployed Jewish language, a wall of screens behind her projected images of American flags flying next to Christian crosses and churches. The awkward marriage between the RNC's performance of what's known as civil religion- a 1960s notion that fuses a symbolic and emotional commitment to the nation-state that mirrors traditional religious devotion-tends to increasingly reflect a sectarian, white, Christian worldview that holds itself out as secular.\n\nOn Monday night at the DNC, Sen. Raphael Warnock , senior pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, embraced faith from the political left in a way that was dramatically different. Warnock called out Trump for weaponizing religious symbols and speech in ways that violate core religious values and leveled blame at certain churches for a willingness to endorse Trumpism at all costs. Warnock is hardly the first Democrat to refuse to cede the language of religious faith to the GOP and to root progressive values in faith values. But these efforts still seem unfamiliar on the left. I spoke to Ilyse Hogue , a senior fellow at New America, the author of The Lie That Binds -a history of the religious right's authoritarian crusade against abortion-and the first person to, in 2016, tell her own story of elective abortion for the stage at the DNC, about what a robust progressive embrace of a thick civic religion could look like. Our conversation, which took place over email, has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nDahlia Lithwick: You have long said that it is a tactical mistake to simply allow the GOP to occupy the faith field for decades. How is it that this came about, and why is any effort to root progressive values in religion seen as inherently divisive and counterproductive?\n\nIlyse Hogue: The 1980 election was a defining moment for the role of religion in party politics. Through the '70s, Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority teamed up with Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle Forum to wrest power from the more dominant Rockefeller Republicans who had advanced a socially liberal, fiscally conservative framework for the GOP. This new \"religious right\" coalition was joined in common cause to reverse the significant advancements of the Civil Rights, gay rights, and women's rights movements of the '60s and '70s. Their cynical ploy was to use the candidacy of Ronald Reagan-a divorced actor cum politician-as a stalking horse to advance their radical vision for a white patriarchy to retain hegemonic power in America. When Reagan's long-shot bid successfully ousted the overtly devout incumbent Jimmy Carter, it sent both sides reeling. That equation-embedding a racist and misogynistic view of social order in a religious ideology-is recognizable as the playbook followed by Falwell's descendants and disciples in the 2016 election of Donald Trump.\n\nThe subsequent political reorganization was predictable, even if ultimately limited. Liberals across the spectrum became wary of religious doctrine as a potential tool to be weaponized and faith as specifically fraught when applied to a vision of a more pluralistic union. In searching for a counterargument to the new right's religious fundamentalism, Democrats sought to strike a balance: Recognize that many embrace religion, while neutralizing the potential risk of it to fracture their coalition. This required a delicate dance of preaching individual tolerance with an orthodox adherence to the constitutional commitment to separate church and state.\n\nI file all this under \"well-intentioned and legally expedient,\" but it was too antiseptic to satiate a growing need for collective frameworks to make sense and seek purpose in an increasingly complicated world. The right's flattened narrative was often cruel but always clear. The GOP easily framed all Dems as godless, waging war on the religious. While many responded defensively-and in fact the party and coalition does include many religious people-these were individual declarations of faith that failed to meet the need for a collective investment in a new vision. Democrats fell short of a road map to a more perfect union and relied on a chaotic hodgepodge of issues, bills, and elections, which are piecemeal at best in a country where so many people, and indeed so many liberals, seek greater purpose.\n\nMore importantly, we ceded the idea that effective politics are a vehicle for connecting people to one another in service of actualizing a higher ideal of our lives and our surroundings.\n\nWarnock told the Atlanta Voice that he was attempting to recapture the moral seriousness of Martin Luther King Jr., who was so comfortable connecting liberal political goals to faith values. I think progressives tend to forget how much religion animated the civil rights battles of the past two centuries. What would reembracing that language look like?\n\nI see it a little differently. Broadly speaking, I think there is a high awareness among progressives of the role of faith in the traditional Civil Rights Movement. I just think it's viewed as a discrete outlier that fails to scale when applied to the diversity of a multifaith coalition.\n\nThe right's effective instrumentalization of religion as a tool to dominate and oppress has embedded an unease among liberal political activists about the intermingling of both. And the sheer number of religions, and belief systems-not to mention the doctrinal rejection of both-housed under the big tent makes organizing exponentially more complicated for Democrats than for their GOP counterpart, with its handful of more homogenous religious factions. The mental gymnastics of attempting to unify so many constituencies while engaging in transactional politics is exhausting. Once you add in the authoritarian right's often-successful attempts to wedge the Democratic coalition by pitting factions against one another, the impulse to forfeit rather than contest the faith ground is understandable even if ill-advised.\n\nAnd then there's the practical matter that some of these religious doctrines are actually in tension with one another. Look at the issue of the day. While some progressive Christian denominations acknowledge legal abortion as a human right, others maintain that it is a sin. Jewish theology has a different take on when life begins. Afraid of inflaming differences, the party took this powerful issue off the table entirely for a long time, instead opting to affirm the legal right in as few words as possible. Unlocking the now-undisputed power of this issue required accepting those internal theological differences as innate to democracy and then, instead of letting them divide, asserting the higher-order value that was universal, the value of freedom.\n\nTo build durable movements for pluralistic democracy, we first need to distinguish between \"religion,\" which is defined by distinctions and differences, and \"faith, \" which is a universal component of the human experience. Simply being alive requires faith to make sense of a chaotic and often cruel world. Faith acknowledges common value in connecting disparate communities and cultures. Faith sustains individuals who often reflect on a life that struggles to measure up by individual metrics. Faith addresses primal needs for meaning and spiritual sustenance that transcend any specific religion or belief system.\n\nWarnock's speech on Monday night stepped into that breach. When he acknowledged his 2020 victory as an advancement for Black Georgians and in the next breath honored the victory of his friend and colleague Sen. Jon Ossoff as a first for Jewish Georgians, he bound our fates and our joys in one. He modeled that we can be proud of our distinctions while celebrating our universal humanity. He showed a refusal to yield an inch to the divide-and-conquer tactics of the right.\n\nUltimately, he took two separate and individual elections-pivotal, yes, but elections nonetheless-and recast them as interconnected and significant milestones made possible by the collective action of a broad movement of people willing to have faith that they could advance \"the best in the American covenant.\" People don't want a thank-you for voting, but they do want that vote to amount to more than the sum of its parts. With that line, Warnock made visible the people who were investing in something larger than him. We need more of that.\n\nOne of the sections so many of us found most arresting in Warnock's speech was his conclusion, which also sounded a key of deep spirituality: \"I need my neighbor's children to be OK so that my children will be OK. I need all of my neighbors' children to be OK. Poor inner-city children in Atlanta and poor children of Appalachia. I need the poor children of Israel and the poor children of Gaza. I need Israelis and Palestinians. I need those in the Congo, those in Haiti, those in Ukraine. I need American children on both sides of the track to be OK because we are all God's children.\"\n\nI think this passage was so resonant because it breathed life into the liberal belief system underlying so many of our principles and policies. And we too often take for granted that voters can see that notion for themselves.\n\nThe GOP vision is a clear version of Christian doctrine that pits individuals against each other in a zero-sum race for survival. Every day on earth is Daniel in the lions' den, where the winner takes all and success is a mark of God's approval no matter how it's achieved. Being on edge and ready to strike is not a cruelty but a necessity in this worldview. The view that God has graced America with the cunning Donald Trump is the walking manifestation of this vision. The fact that Donald Trump has achieved wealth and power through coercion and corruption is a testament to the fact that God graced him with the cunning necessary to win in a brutal world. Any transgressions against God's other commandments can be dispensed with through pantomimed atonement and performative prayer. It's a worldview as neat as it is twisted.\n\nThat passage was Warnock's way of modeling that to win, we need to offer more than competing policy platforms. We need to model a compelling and clear belief system that sharply contrasts the right. One that illuminates the understanding of our interdependence as an asset and makes the application of universal rights, freedoms, and opportunities more than a feel-good aspiration or tagline. It's a mission that binds us in our collective destiny. Working for that transcends politics and becomes a spiritual act.\n\nAll of this requires faith that this nation of ours can be healed. A faith that Warnock acknowledged has been profoundly shaken. But Democrats and liberals should take heed that restoring faith in our nation requires a willingness for the party and the movements that undergird it to invest in a framework that respects our individual identities and ladders up to our common humanity.\n\nThen our votes will be the kind of prayer the reverend speaks of, one \"for the world we desire for ourselves and our children.\"\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Democrats push to emphasize 'fight' post-Signal scandal, but is that enough?: ANALYSIS\n\nSeveral Democrats have called for Trump officials' resignation amid the fallout.\n\nIn a climate where wins have been hard to come by, Democrats in Washington were able to go on offense amid outrage over the group chat on messaging app Signal in which top Trump officials discussed a U.S. military strike on Houthi rebels in Yemen.\n\nDemocrats were able to confront some of those officials and call for resignations.\n\n\"As the secretary of defense, I think it's time for [Pete Hegseth] to either resign or be fired,\" House Foreign Affairs Committee ranking member Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., said in an interview with ABC News' Linsey Davis on Wednesday.\n\nIn committee hearings on Capitol Hill, Democratic lawmaker after Democratic lawmaker challenged Trump administration officials with poster-sized images of text messages containing sensitive and possibly classified information about the strike. They questioned Trump administration intelligence leaders fiercely, admonishing their participation in the chat.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., on Thursday echoed calls from members of his caucus that Hegseth resign or be fired. He also was sure to highlight that Democrats in both chambers are putting up a fight against Republicans.\n\n\"Democrats, I think, showed fight in the Senate hearing Tuesday and in the House hearing on Wednesday. Our veterans have stood up to push back against this stunning national security breach,\" Jeffries said. \"That's a fight that we're in right now. Are we on the sidelines? Have we been silent about this scandal?\"\n\nJeffries' assertion that Democrats are fighting back against this administration in the face of this scandal comes as recent polling indicates that Democratic voters want the party to fight harder against Republicans.\n\nDespite the vociferous calls for accountability from Democratic lawmakers, the likelihood of real consequences for any of the Trump administration participants is small because Democrats would need Republican buy-in with GOP majorities in Congress. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has said he doesn't think any additional investigation is necessary, and the bulk of his caucus will follow his lead. The White House will continue to try and move past it despite lawsuits against members of the administration.\n\nWhat remains to be seen is if a fight by Democrats stymied by the realities of their minority status is enough to satisfy Democratic voters. Only time will tell if instances like this will be a boon to the party's abysmal approval numbers or if its continued inability to effect change in Washington will keep Democratic supporters frustrated.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "'Extreme alarm': Democrats demand answers after Signal chat firestorm\n\nSenators expressed \"extreme alarm\" about the potential security breach.\n\nMinority Leader Chuck Schumer and top Senate Democrats from national security committees wrote a letter to President Donald Trump seeking more information about reports that members of his cabinet used the Signal app to convene a group chat to \"coordinate and share classified information about sensitive military planning operations\" and mistakenly included The Atlantic Editor-in-Chief Jeff Goldberg.\n\n\"We write to you with extreme alarm about the astonishingly poor judgment shown by your Cabinet and national security advisors,\" the senators wrote, according to a copy of the letter obtained by ABC News. \"You have long advocated for accountability and transparency in the government, particularly as it relates to the handling of classified information, national security, and the safety of American servicemembers. As such, it is imperative that you address this breach with the seriousness and diligence that it demands.\"\n\nCommittees \"have serious questions about this incident, and members need a full accounting to ensure it never happens again,\" the letter said. The authors requested a \"complete and unredacted\" transcript of the Signal chat for the appropriate committees to review in a secure setting.\n\nThe senators also called on Attorney General Pam Bondi to carry out a thorough investigation of the matter, citing concerns that \"willful or negligent disclosure of classified or sensitive national security information may constitute a criminal violation of the Espionage Act or other laws.\"\n\nThe letter asked Trump to preserve the chat in question, along with any other discussions of government business occurring on any messaging application, citing concerns that the Signal messages -- which are set to automatically disappear after a fixed period of time -- could violate both Federal Records Act and the Presidential Records Act.\n\n\"You and your Cabinet are responsible for the safety and security of the American people, as well as our military servicemembers and intelligence personnel in the field. We expect your Administration to address this dangerous lapse in security protocol-whether intended or not-with the utmost seriousness, and to uphold the ethic of accountability that our nation holds sacred,\" the letter said.\n\nThe letter is signed by Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Dick Durbin, Armed Services Committee Ranking Member Jack Reed, Foreign Relations Committee Ranking Member Jeanne Shaheen, Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner, Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense ranking member Chris Coons, and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs ranking member Gary Peters. It therefore represents a joint statement from the top Democrats across the committees dealing with national security matters.\n\nIn their letter to Trump, the Senators asked for answers to 10 specific questions related to the reported Signal chat, including a full list of its participants.\n\nThose included inquiries about whether any other individuals were mistakenly added to the chat, whether any individual used a personal device to access the chat, whether anyone was out of the country while accessing the chat and whether any classified documents were transferred to unclassified systems. The senators also sought a response on whether the intelligence community has done a damage assessment of the matter.\n\nThe senators further requested an answer about whether any cabinet or White House officials are using Signal or other commercial products to discuss classified or sensitive information, or any communications subject to statutory recordkeeping requirements. If so, they asked the White House to provide details on how it is meeting record-keeping requirements.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Leading Democrats react to Trump administration inadvertently sharing highly sensitive war plans\n\n\"This kind of carelessness is how people get killed,\" Schumer said.\n\nTop Congressional Democrats are expressing outrage after members of President Donald Trump's administration inadvertently added Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, to an unsecured message thread discussing highly sensitive war plans on Monday.\n\nNational Security Adviser Mike Waltz, who apparently added Goldberg to the Signal chat, was joined on the thread by those identified by Goldberg as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio -- among others.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer responded forcefully on the chamber floor on Monday, calling upon Leader John Thune and Senate Republicans to work with Democrats in calling a \"full investigation\" into why officials had coordinated military operations over Signal, rather than using taxpayer-funded secure communications channels.\n\n\"Mr. President, this is one of the most stunning breaches of military intelligence I have read about in a very, very long time,\" Schumer said.\n\n\"What we have here are senior U.S. leaders, including the Vice President and Secretary of Defense, having classified discussions of military action over an unsecure app,\" Schumer continued. \"It's bad enough that a private citizen was added to this chain, but it's far worse that sensitive military information was exchanged on an unauthorized application, especially when that sensitive military information was so so important.\"\n\n\"This kind of carelessness is how people get killed. It's how our enemies can take advantage of us. It's how our national security falls into danger,\" he added.\n\nThe Democratic leader said that the investigation he's called for should look into how this \"debacle\" happened, the damage it created, and how they could avoid it in the future.\n\n\"Every single Senator-- Republican and Democrat and Independent, must demand accountability. If a government employee shared sensitive military plans like this, they'd be investigated and face very harsh consequences,\" Schumer said.\n\nHe also suggested that his Republican colleagues should be as \"outraged\" by this incident as they were over the email controversy involving former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the days before the 2016 election, which she lost to Trump.\n\n\"If you were up in arms over unsecure emails years ago, you should certainly be outraged by this amateurish behavior,\" Schumer said.\n\nSchumer ended his brief remarks by claiming that Democrats has anticipated an event like this one when they opposed Hegseth's nomination.\n\n\"When Pete Hegseth came before the Senate as a nominee, Democrats warned that something like this might happen. These people are clearly not up for the job. we warned confirming them was dangerous, that they behaved recklessly. Unfortunately, we were right. Now, we must have accountability in both parties. The Senate should investigate how this blunder was even possible,\" Schumer said.\n\nClinton also reacted. \"You have got to be kidding me,\" she posted on X on Monday.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries also advocated for a congressional investigation and directly called out Hegseth.\n\n\"There should absolutely be a congressional investigation so that we can understand what happened. Why did it happen, and how do we prevent this type of national security breach from ever happening again,\" Jeffries said at a press conference on Monday.\n\nJeffries, who got fired up when asked about the incident, called the situation \"reckless, irresponsible and dangerous\" and suggested that those involved were \"jeopardizing America's national security\" -- before sharply criticizing Hegseth.\n\n\"This whole Trump administration is filled with lackeys and incompetent cronies. I'm not talking about any particular individual, though,\" he said. \"I will note that the secretary of Defense who was on that chain has got to be the most unqualified person ever to lead the Pentagon in American history. Think about that.\"\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson downplayed the flurry of national security concerns on Monday afternoon.\n\n\"Look, I'm not going to characterize what happened. I think the administration has acknowledged it was a mistake, and they'll tighten up and make sure it doesn't happen again. I don't know what else you can say about,\" he told reporters at the Capitol, following a White House event where he appeared alongside Trump and the governor of Louisiana.\n\nJohnson added that he doesn't believe Waltz or Hegseth should be disciplined for the incident.\n\nIn addition to his on-camera remarks, Jeffries released a statement on the national security breach, calling it \"completely outrageous.\"\n\n\"It is yet another unprecedented example that our nation is increasingly more dangerous because of the elevation of reckless and mediocre individuals, including the Secretary of Defense,\" Jeffries said.\n\nHe reiterated his call for a Congressional investigation into the matter -- even though Democrats have little power to do so since they are in the minority.\n\n\"If House Republicans are truly serious about keeping America safe, and not simply being sycophants and enablers, they must join Democrats in a swift, serious and substantive investigation into this unacceptable and irresponsible national security breach,\" he concluded.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Honolulu on Monday, during a layover for a trip to Asia, Hegseth disputed Goldberg's description of the chat, saying \"nobody was texting war plans.\"\n\nTrump said he \"doesn't know anything about it\" when first asked about the reports on Monday afternoon. The Pentagon referred questions to the National Security Council and the White House.\n\nWhen asked by ABC News on Monday, the White House said that the Signal chat \"appears to be authentic.\" Additionally, White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes shared with ABC News the statement he provided to The Atlantic confirming the veracity of a Signal group chat.\n\nBoth the top Republican and top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee said Monday that they expect to receive classified briefings aimed at addressing the incident.\n\nABC News' Fritz Farrow, Jay O'Brien, Lauren Peller and T.

      "text": "Democrats host town halls to hear from voters, fire up supporters -- but is their message resonating?\n\nAs Republicans pull back from in-person events, Democrats step into the void.\n\nBETHLEHEM, Pa. -- At a \"People's Town Hall\" on Thursday held by the Democratic National Committee, in a church located in a Pennsylvania district that Democrats lost to Republicans in 2024, party leaders fired up the crowd when slamming the White House and congressional Republicans over Medicaid, federal government cuts, and other issues.\n\nTown halls are among the strategies that Democrats are using to try to get their base fired up against the Trump White House -- but attendees there and at other events say they're still looking for the Democratic Party to take on Republicans more directly.\n\nDNC chair Ken Martin, speaking at the Bethlehem event, called President Donald Trump and key adviser Elon Musk \"cowards,\" riling up the crowd by framing the work of the duo in stark terms.\n\n\"There's nothing moral about what these cowards are doing, and there's nothing moral about what we saw today in Washington, D.C., as Donald Musk -- Donald Trump and his president, President Musk, decided to do, signing that executive order eliminating the Department of Education, which is going to have a disproportionate impact on the disabled community and so many children throughout this country,\" Martin told the crowd, amidst boos towards Trump and Musk.\n\nAnd Maryland Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, who received among the loudest applause of any of the panelists, took a starker tone: \"Don't let anybody tell you that we're in a constitutional crisis,\" Raskin said.\n\n\"Because that is too passive-sounding. That's too ambiguous. This is an attack on the Constitution of the United States, and we're going to defend the Constitution of the United States!\"\n\nThe Democratic Party claims that it's holding these town halls as a way to hear directly from voters.\n\n\"The purpose of these town halls is not for us to spread our message, but us to hear from people throughout this country right now who are facing deep and serious impacts to their own lives, to their neighborhoods and communities, because of what this administration is doing,\" Martin told ABC News on Thursday after the town hall.\n\nBut Martin and others, explicitly, are also emphasizing the idea that Democrats are showing up and hosting these events while Republicans are pulling back from hosting in-person events or facing fierce pushback from constituents when they do. Some of the loudest applause in the church on Thursday came when speakers criticized the district's representative, Ryan Mackenzie -- who in 2024 narrowly flipped the seat held by Democrat Susan Wild.\n\nArnaud Armstrong, a spokesman for Mackenzie, told ABC News in a statement on Wednesday that Mackenzie has answered questions at in-person events and would run a telephone town hall on Thursday night to allow for more people to speak with the congressman, including people with disabilities or seniors who might struggle to make it to an in-person event.\n\nDuring that telephone town hall, Mackenzie said, \"This is the best way that I have found to reach literally thousands of people at once and be able to have this kind of conversation.\"\n\nThe town halls come as Democratic voters show disillusion with their party.\n\nA recent CNN/SSRS poll taken in early March found that 52% of Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents felt that the leadership of the Democrats is taking the party in the wrong direction, and that 57% felt that the party should mainly work to \"stop the Republican agenda.\"\n\nWhile waiting in line outside to enter the town hall, some residents of Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley region told ABC News that President Donald Trump's actions struck close to home or worried them -- but that they felt disillusioned with the broader Democratic response so far.\n\nCarole Ostfeld, a retired teacher from Allentown, Pennsylvania, came bearing a sign that said \"Hands off Medicaid.\" She and her husband David told ABC News that they came out to the town hall in order to protest Trump and Musk, including because of Trump's actions with the Department of Education.\n\nBut asked how they feel about the Democratic response to the Trump administration, Carole Ostfeld said, \"I've got very mixed feelings --\"\n\nHer husband added, \"It needs to be more.\"\n\nAsked if Democrats' messaging is resonating with them, Carole Ostfeld said it is -- but, \"as they say, you can't fight city hall,\" as Republicans are in power.\n\nAnother attendee, Ann Frechette of Easton, Pennsylvania, said the news about Trump signing an order to dismantle the Department of Education, which came that day, struck close to home. \"I have a son in college who benefits from a Pell Grant,\" she told ABC News. \"And I'm afraid that that Pell Grant will disappear, that monies like that will disappear. He's on Medicaid, I think he may lose his health insurance. There's so many things.\"\n\nBut the broader Democratic response was disillusioning her as well. While she praised some individual lawmakers, including Raskin, she added, \"I think the Democrats in general, they don't -- I'm a Democrat, but my party doesn't seem to get the message that was delivered last November. I would like people to stand up to what is being done.\"\n\nThat said, the town hall itself was by many measures a success -- or at least, the Democratic speakers were able to fire up their supporters.\n\nAll of the pews were filled, with some attendees standing on the back or the sides of the sanctuary; and the crowd gave thunderous standing ovations to the speakers multiple times - particularly when, for instance, Raskin spoke about taking on Trump or former Democratic Rep. Susan Wild criticized the incumbent representative.\n\nPeople paid attention as audience members shared their own stories and questions, and then applauded them warmly, cheering on their peers in a clear show of support.\n\nDuring a question and answer portion of the town hall, attendees raised concerns about the future of Medicaid, educational programs, and other issues.\n\nAnother attendee, Terri Neifert, told the crowd that she has lived in Bethlehem almost her entire life and became disabled after a fall at a grocery store, which changed the trajectory of her life. She said she managed to get her degree and to support her family through Medicare, food banks, and Social Security disability.\n\n\"If they cut Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps... I would lose everything,\" Neifert told the crowd.\n\nNeifert received a round of applause from the audience, and other attendees went up to her after the event wrapped to thank her for sharing her story.\n\nAsked by ABC News after the town hall how she was feeling by then about the Democrats' response to the Trump administration, Neifert -- similar to other attendees -- focused on the road ahead.\n\n\"It looks like it's gonna be a fight, and an uphill battle... more public outcry, more marches, and Congress needs to pull up their big boy pants and start doing their job,\" Neifert said.\n\nSome Democrats or Democratic-aligned allies are taking a different tack than the town halls -- and going on the road.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, a progressive independent who caucuses with Democrats, has been on the road for weeks with what he calls the \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour, making stops for rallies in both right- and left-leaning districts. The Democratic Party has shown support for his efforts, reposting social media posts from Sanders about the tour.\n\nOut there on Sanders' tour, some attendees said they're disillusioned with the party's response to Trump.\n\n\"They gotta be a little tougher,\" one rally attendee told \"This Week\" co-anchor Jonathan Karl at the Denver event. Another was blunter: \"Quit being a bunch of doormats.\"\n\nBut -- in a sign that the rallies may be a successful tactic for Democrats to reach their base -- they're attracting thousands of people. Sander's Denver appearance, alongside Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., brought in more than 30,000 attendees.\n\nSanders said it was the largest rally he's ever hosted -- bigger than the rallies on his two presidential runs.\n\nSanders himself has his own criticism for the Democratic Party, telling Karl in an interview on ABC News' \"This Week\" that the Democrats should have done more for working people when they had control of the Senate.\n\n\"And since then, do I think the Democrats have been effective in rallying the American people, in stopping Trump's movement toward oligarchy and authoritarianism? No, I don't,\" Sanders told Karl.\n\nDonna Brazile, a former DNC chair and an ABC News contributor, said on \"This Week\" after Sanders' interview, said, \"Bernie Sanders is filling a void, a major void left after, of course, the defeat of Kamala Harris last year by Donald Trump. This void has to be filled because there's so much anger, anger not just in red districts, but also in blue districts.\"\n\nThat void is one that Democrats hope to fill with these events.\n\nMartin, asked by ABC News after the Bethlehem town hall if he thought the messages of the Democrats is going to resonate in Republican districts or with Democrats themselves, said that wasn't really the point.\n\n\"It's really not about the message resonating,\" Martin said. \"What this is about is listening to people. Hearing the concerns of Americans right now throughout this country, who deserve to be heard, right?\"\n\nMartin added later: \"We're going to fill a void for them, and we're going to talk to more people throughout this country.\"\n\nABC News' Hannah Demissie, Isabella Murray, Jonathan Karl, Meghan Mistry and Quinn Scanlan contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

That means they do their jobs independently, and as CEO I have no editorial role at NPR.\"\n\nMinutes later, Kerger added: \"PBS stations are focused on the needs and interests of the viewers they serve. Especially in rural areas, PBS stations are the only outlets providing coverage for local events, for example high school sports, local history and culture content, candidate debates at every level of the election ballot and specialized agricultural news.\"\n\nThe hearing, titled \"Anti-American Airwaves: Holding the Heads of NPR and PBS Accountable,\" was held by the Delivering on Government Efficiency (DOGE) subcommittee, the name of which echoes the Department of Government Efficiency, the Trump administration's cost-cutting initiative overseen by Elon Musk.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., criticized NPR and PBS during the hearing for what she called liberal bias, pointing to federal funding for the outlets as the target of potential cuts.\n\n\"NPR and PBS have increasingly become radical, left-wing echo chambers for a narrow audience of mostly wealthy, white, urban liberals and progressives,\" Greene said.\n\nRep. Stephen Lynch, D-Mass., defended the public media outlets and criticized the hearing as a distraction for more important issues often taken up by the House Oversight Committee, the larger body to which the DOGE subcommittee belongs.\n\n\"I'm sad to see this once proud committee -- the principle investigative committee in the House of Representatives -- has now stooped to the lowest levels of partisanship and political theater to hold a hearing to go after the likes of Elmo and Cookie Monster and Arthur the aardvark,\" Lynch said.\n\nLater in the hearing, Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., said sarcastically: \"Is Elmo now, or has he ever been, a member of the Communist Party?\"\n\nAnother Democratic lawmaker, Rep. Greg Casar, of Texas, said: \"Leave Elmo alone, bring Elon in for questioning instead,\" referring to billionaire Elon Musk, who is the public face of the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nRep. James Comer, R-Ky., sharply criticized NPR's previous coverage of the origins of COVID-19 and a House investigation into the Biden family, which Comer led.\n\n\"I think you've abused the privilege that you had with receiving federal funds,\" Comer said, sitting in front of placards featuring NPR headlines with which he said he took issue.\n\nIn response, Maher, of NPR, said: \"I want to recognize your concerns,\" noting that she took steps to \"beef up our editorial standards\" after taking her position last year.\n\n\"Why is NPR even doing editorials?\" Comer responded, exasperated, and apparently confused about what \"editorial standards\" meant. \"Do you even need opinion -- if you're a federally funded entity that's supposed to provide the news?\"\n\n\"I mean, editorial standards for our journalism ... bringing in more editors to make sure that we have more points of view reflected in every story. I've engaged in a number of actions,\" she said, before Comer cut her off.\n\n\"I've lost confidence in public radio,\" he said.\n\nWhile the media chiefs defended their editorial standards, Maher did acknowledge that the stations' handling of the Hunter Biden laptop story was \"a mistake.\"\n\n\"I do want to say that NPR acknowledges that we were mistaken and failing to cover the Hunter Biden laptop story more aggressively and sooner,\" Maher said.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Each billboard calls the member of Congress a \"coward\" and provides the phone number for the member's Washington, D.C., office to \"demand a town hall.\"\n\nDemocrats have claimed in recent weeks that Republican members are not holding town halls because they want to avoid their constituents' anger over President Donald Trump's policies and cuts to the federal government. Both the national party and individual elected officials have also begun holding town halls in Republican-held districts .\n\n\"We are hosting events in Republican-held districts and we are pasting Republican representatives' phone numbers on billboards across their districts because working families deserve to be heard,\" Martin wrote.\n\nIn a statement to ABC News responding to the billboard campaign, Republican National Committee Communications Director Zach Parkinson wrote, \"The Democrat Party's approval rating just hit a record low after getting trounced in November, and the DNC's new messaging strategy is to buy some billboards. We fully encourage liberal donors to keep funding these innovative approaches at the DNC.\"\n\nEarlier this month, House Republicans were encouraged by the National Republican Congressional Committee to do more virtual events over in-person town halls, which allows for more control, although some Republican members have continued to host or appear at in-person town halls despite the pushback.\n\nOn Tuesday, Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., held a 90-minute town hall, though he faced numerous interruptions from audience members.\n\n\"Ultimately, I am accountable to you,\" Flood told constituents on Tuesday. \"You will decide whether I do this job. The people of the 1st District will decide whether I do this job. I will continue to do town halls. I will continue to show up in person.\"\n\nABC News' Lalee Ibssa contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "CNN Poll: Democratic Party's favorability drops to a record low\n\nFollow:\n\nThe Democratic Party's favorability rating among Americans stands at a record low, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS, fueled in part by dimming views from its own frustrated supporters.\n\nWith many in the party saying publicly that their leaders should do more to stand up to President Donald Trump, Democrats and Democratic-aligned independents say, 57% to 42%, that Democrats should mainly work to stop the Republican agenda, rather than working with the GOP majority to get some Democratic ideas into legislation.\n\nThe survey was taken March 6-9, days before 10 Democratic senators - including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer - voted with Republicans in the chamber to advance a GOP-authored spending bill to avert a government shutdown, much to the chagrin of many other Democratic lawmakers and progressive critics.\n\nThe majority's desire to fight the GOP marks a significant change in the party's posture from the start of Trump's first term. A September 2017 poll found a broad 74% majority of Democrats and Democratic leaners saying their party should work with Republicans in an attempt to advance their own priorities, and just 23% advocating for a more combative approach.\n\nDemocratic-aligned adults say, 52% to 48%, that the leadership of the Democratic Party is currently taking the party in the wrong direction. That's another shift from eight years ago, when views on this metric were largely positive.\n\nAmong the American public overall, the Democratic Party's favorability rating stands at just 29% - a record low in CNN's polling dating back to 1992 and a drop of 20 points since January 2021, when Trump exited his first term under the shadow of the January 6 attack at on Capitol. The Republican Party's rating currently stands at 36%.\n\nThat's driven in part by relatively high levels of dissatisfaction within the Democratic Party. Just 63% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents report a favorable view of their own party, a dip from 72% in January and 81% at the start of President Joe Biden's administration. The decline comes across ideological wings, with favorability ratings for the Democratic Party falling by 18 points among liberals and moderates alike since the start of 2021.\n\nBy contrast, 79% of Republicans and Republican leaners currently take a positive view of the GOP. Political independents as a group take dim views of both parties, with 19% rating the Democrats favorably and 20% saying the same of the Republicans.\n\nBoth the Democratic and the Republican parties are viewed by about half the public as having views and policies that are too extreme, rather than generally mainstream. That's a change from 2022, when most Americans - 56% - called the Democratic Party's positions mainstream. Views of the GOP have remained effectively unchanged over that time.\n\nPolitical independents remain likelier to see the Republicans as out of the mainstream - 57% call the GOP too extreme, while 48% say the same of the Democrats. But 16% of Democrats call their own party too extreme, while just 9% of Republicans say the same of the GOP.\n\nThe public continues to draw a distinction between Trump and his party. Americans are 9 points likelier to call the president too extreme than to say the same of the Republican Party as a whole, although that's down from an 18-point gap in 2022.\n\nDemocrats, who overwhelmingly consider Trump too extreme, have yet to consolidate around any one-party leader to serve as a counterpoint. Asked in an open-ended question to name the Democratic leader they feel \"best reflects the core values\" of the party, 10% of Democratic-aligned adults name New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 9% former vice president Kamala Harris, 8% Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and 6% House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Another 4% each name former president Barack Obama and Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett, with Schumer joining a handful of others at 2%.\n\nMore than 30% didn't offer a name in response. \"No one,\" one respondent answered. \"That's the problem.\"\n\nMichigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, who delivered the party's response to Trump's presidential address this month, remains largely unknown. A separate question finds that nearly three-quarters of Americans have never heard of her or have no opinion of her, with the remainder roughly split in their opinions. Slotkin is scarcely better known within her own party, although Democratic-aligned adults who do express a view of her are largely positive, 24% favorable to 6% unfavorable.\n\nOcasio Cortez's stock in the party is especially high among those who describe themselves as liberal and those younger than 45, with roughly 1 in 6 within each of those groups calling her emblematic of the party's values. No Democratic leader polled in the double digits among older adults or moderates on this metric.\n\nDemocratic-aligned adults' views of their party and its leadership also divide sharply along demographic lines, the poll finds. Those who call themselves Democrats are far likelier than independents who lean toward the party to express favorable views of the Democrats (72% to 37%), and to say the party's leaders are taking it in the right direction (53% to 34%).\n\nAnd while the party leadership earns positive reviews from most Democratic-aligned women (57% of whom say they're taking Democrats in the right direction), people of color (57%) and those without college degrees (60%), just 38% of men and 32% of White college graduates say the same.\n\nBy contrast, majorities across demographic lines say they want to see Democrats work to stop the Republican agenda, with little daylight between the views of those who describe themselves as Democrats, and those of independents who lean toward the party. The only remaining Democratic-aligned group to edge in favor of compromise are moderates: they say, 51% to 48%, that Democrats should mainly try to work with Republicans.\n\nThe CNN poll was conducted by SSRS from March 6-9 among a random national sample of 1,206 US adults drawn from a probability-based panel. Surveys were either conducted online or by telephone with a live interviewer. Results among all adults have a margin of sampling error of ±3.3 percentage points. Results among the 504 Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents have a margin of sampling error of ±5.0 percentage points.\n\nCNN's Jennifer Agiesta and Edward Wu contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "'Something stinks': Elon Musk, congressional Republicans target Democrats' main fundraising machine\n\nFollow:\n\nActBlue, a fundraising juggernaut for liberal candidates and causes, is facing stepped-up scrutiny and criticism from Republicans on Capitol Hill and allies of President Donald Trump - as the GOP flexes its new power in Washington and targets one of the key pillars of the Democratic Party's financial infrastructure.\n\nThree Republicans in Congress - including the chairmen of the House Oversight and Administration panels - are urging Trump's Treasury Department to share with lawmakers reports of suspicious financial transactions related to ActBlue. Other GOP lawmakers are demanding probes by Treasury and the FBI into whether the fundraising platform has helped organizations engaged in terrorism or violated federal campaign finance laws.\n\nAnd billionaire Trump donor Elon Musk - who is overseeing the administration's controversial effort to rapidly shrink the federal government - has criticized ActBlue, seeking to tie it to protests and acts of vandalism against his electric-vehicle company Tesla. He has argued, without evidence to substantiate his claims, that some prominent Democrats - including one who died in 2019 - were funding ActBlue and the protests.\n\nRelated ARTICLE How elderly dementia patients are unwittingly fueling political campaigns\n\n\"Something stinks about ActBlue,\" Musk posted earlier this month on his social media platform, X.\n\nOfficials with ActBlue deny any wrongdoing.\n\n\"ActBlue has always dealt with attacks and baseless claims from the Right that are designed to undermine the power of the small-dollar donors who rely on our platform,\" spokesperson Megan Hughes said in a statement in CNN. \"This new, coordinated attack is different only in scale, and our team remains steadfast in defending against these bad-faith attacks.\"\n\nShe said the platform would continue its \"mission to expand access to political giving and ensure people-powered movements continue to thrive.\"\n\nActBlue, a nonprofit organization, is a fundraising powerhouse for Democrats and progressive groups - helping to funnel small-dollar donations to candidates, party committees and others. In all, it has collected more than $16 billion since its founding in 2004, according to a running tally on its website.\n\nAlthough it has competitors, it has long dominated processing payments online for the party. According to the platform, more than 14 million users have saved their contact and payment information with the group, allowing contributors to easily make one-click donations.\n\nBut the ramped-up criticism from Republicans comes as ActBlue has faced internal tumult - including the recent departure of several high-level staffers as first reported by The New York Times - and criticism from some Democratic consultants and others in liberal circles over whether the platform is doing enough to protect donors from deceptive tactics.\n\nLast December, for instance, dozens of individuals and progressive groups signed an open letter to ActBlue, urging reforms - including prohibiting political committees that raise money on the platform from using misleading language in fundraising solicitations.\n\nBut some Democrats worry that - with Republicans now controlling all the levers of government in Washington - the increased scrutiny could serve as a precursor to a Republican attempt to shut down the platform entirely and undermine Democratic fundraising in future elections.\n\nJosh Nelson, the CEO of the ad platform Civic Shout and one of the signatories of last year's letter recommending changes to ActBlue's policies, said his concerns about its internal practices have taken a back seat this year to his growing alarm over what he views as \"illegitimate attacks\" from the GOP.\n\n\"I think Republicans know that ActBlue has been an extremely effective fundraising platform for thousands of Democratic campaigns and progressive groups,\" Nelson said. \"They're just trying to use power to harm their political opponents in future elections.\"\n\n\"The question is how far will Republicans go?\"\n\nGOP lawmakers in recent years have increased their scrutiny of ActBlue, questioning how it guards against fraud and prevents foreigners from illegally contributing to US campaigns. Among the issues raised: ActBlue did not always require donors to add the CVV number - or card verification value - on every credit card transaction.\n\n(ActBlue has added the CVV requirement but has said it has long used several reliable means to prevent fraud and prohibit illicit foreign contributions, including an address verification system to ensure cardholder addresses match those at the banks that issued the cards. Americans living abroad, for instance, also must include a copy of their passport photo.)\n\nBut this month has seen a slew of fresh ActBlue activity from GOP lawmakers, who are seeking executive branch probes or access to sensitive documents from Treasury, such as the \"suspicious activity reports\" or SARs, which financial institutions file with the agency to flag suspected cases of money laundering, fraud or other suspicious transactions.\n\nWisconsin GOP Rep. Bryan Steil, who oversees the House Administration Committee, and others have complained that the Biden administration provided only limited information in response to requests for the reports involving ActBlue.\n\nHe recently joined House Oversight and Accountability Committee chairman, Kentucky Rep. James Comer, and New York Rep. Nick Langworthy in a letter that seeks all suspicious activity reports mentioning ActBlue filed at any point from January 1, 2023.\n\nIt's not clear whether Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will cooperate.\n\nCurrently, the House Administration Committee \"is in communication with the Treasury Department about reviewing SARs,\" a source familiar told CNN this week. A Treasury spokesperson did not comment.\n\nOther GOP lawmakers pushing for probes of the fundraising platform include Trump allies, California Rep. Darrell Issa and Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs.\n\nIn the meantime, Democrats are trying to use the GOP scrutiny to bring in more political contributions.\n\n\"Republicans are attacking ActBlue because small-dollar donations from people like you are a major advantage for Democratic campaigns up-and-down the ballot,\" read a recent fundraising email from the Democratic National Committee.\n\nThe appeal then links users to ActBlue to help Democrats \"fight back.\"\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "'Try actually fighting': Democrats face voters' fury at town halls\n\nFollow:\n\nDemocratic lawmakers have faced eruptions of anger at town hall meetings across the country this week, as constituents have coupled their fury over President Donald Trump 's actions with deep frustration over what they see as a feckless Democratic response.\n\nArizona Sens. Mark Kelly and Ruben Gallego were told to \"fight dirtier\" and \"get in the mud\" with Republicans.\n\n\"We want you to show some of the backbone and strategic brilliance that Mitch McConnell would have in the minority,\" a man told Maryland Rep. Glenn Ivey.\n\n\"They should try actually fighting for once. They should try to actually be the opposition party,\" an attendee groused to CNN at a town hall held by Illinois Rep. Sean Casten.\n\nThe sharp criticism from voters comes as Democrats are out of power across all levels of the federal government and lacking a clear leader, exposing deep divisions along ideological and tactical lines over the party's direction. The schism emerging within the party on the heels of a contentious government funding fight has prevented the caucus from uniting behind a single strategy to counter Trump and attempt to make political inroads ahead of next year's midterm elections.\n\nRelated article Inside and outside the Senate, Democrats begin to lose faith in Schumer\n\nThe tension between Democratic lawmakers and their voters spilled into public view days after the Republican-led House and Senate narrowly averted a shutdown by approving a short-term government spending measure - with the help of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and nine others in his caucus who cleared a pathway for the bill.\n\nEager to avoid embarrassment as Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk slash federal spending and remake the federal government, Republican leaders told the party's House members not to hold town hall meetings during this week's congressional recess.\n\nMost Republicans heeded those calls. Those who didn't - Nebraska Rep. Mike Flood and Wyoming Rep. Harriet Hageman, among them - faced heckling and pointed questions, including some from Republican voters, at their events.\n\nFlood was asked how he \"personally stomachs\" limiting funding for medical research after his wife was diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\nCarol Moseman, a Republican who voted for Flood, told CNN she doesn't want Congress to give up its role as a check on the Trump administration.\n\n\"I want to hear that he and other Republicans are going to stand up for democracy that they're not going to let Mr. Trump take over using executive powers,\" she said. \"We voted for Congress to enact laws, and that's not happening.\"\n\nHageman faced concerns in her deep-red district over federal spending cuts and frozen grants. Kindergarten teacher Tomi Sue Wille said she supports Trump's push to dismantle the Department of Education but worries that crucial federal funding for special needs children won't reach her students.\n\n\"I do believe that Congress needs to take some control in making sure how that funding is still distributed to the states,\" Wille told CNN.\n\nAt another town hall, a voter who identified herself as a retired military officer and Republican, pressed Hageman on allegations of fraud in the government in a tense exchange.\n\n\"You are a lawyer, where is this fraud?\" the voter asked Hageman, according to CSPAN video of the town hall. The voter added: \"What company, what organization, what personnel are we going after?\"\n\nHageman pointed to spending by the US Agency for International Development - which the Trump administration and DOGE are attempting to dismantle - as the fraud. \"This is what it is. This is the spending associated with the fraud. This is the fraud, spending is the fraud,\" Hageman asserted, to the dissatisfaction of the constituent and other attendees, who repeatedly interrupted her as she attempted to cite numbers.\n\nA federal worker and Republican in Wyoming, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak freely, said GOP rhetoric about federal employees has been a let-down - including Musk's \"fork in the road\" email offering months of severance pay, which the worker described as \"a little off-putting.\"\n\n\"I don't think we're all parasites\" the federal worker told CNN. \"I try not to take it too personally. I know what I do. I know how committed I am.\"\n\nGoing into the week, Democrats took most Republicans retreating from public view as an invitation to meet with their constituents and drive a forceful argument about how Republicans' government funding plan would slash spending on programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nRelated article Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez says Democratic Party needs to fight harder while rallying with Bernie Sanders\n\nBut the anger that greeted Democrats at their own town halls left them returning to Washington next week without appearing to have gained great political momentum during their time at home - instead offering a vivid window into the party's struggles during the first two months of Trump's presidency.\n\nThe Democratic Party's favorability rating among Americans stands at a record low of just 29%, a CNN poll conducted by SSRS earlier this month found - an outcome fueled in part by dimming views from its own frustrated supporters.\n\nDemocrats and Democratic-aligned independents say, 57% to 42%, that the party should mainly work to stop the Republican agenda, rather than working with the GOP majority to get some Democratic ideas into legislation.\n\nBranding it a \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has aimed to galvanize those looking for some form of political action with rallies across the country. New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a fellow progressive, joined the swing through competitive Western states Thursday - but, underscoring the party's divide, that answer to Democratic voters' demands for action drew public criticism from some corners of the party.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, at an event in Las Vegas, Nevada, said Trump has \"handed the keys to Elon Musk and is selling this country for parts to the richest people on the planet for a kickback.\" But she also had sharp words for her own party.\n\n\"We need a Democratic Party that fights harder for us too,\" Ocasio-Cortez said. \"But what that means is that we as a community must choose and vote for Democrats and elected officials who know how to stand for the working class.\"\n\nAt the town hall meetings, attendees who voted for Democrats, including Vice President Kamala Harris over Trump in the 2024 presidential election, said they felt let down by the party's failure to show it's up to the task of matching their furor and responding with force.\n\nIn Scottsdale, Arizona, when Kelly and Gallego argued at a joint event Monday that there was a path to convince Republicans to preserve Medicaid, Jacie Czerwinski had heard enough.\n\n\"When are they going to take the gloves off and actually do something,\" she said under her breath. \"They're preaching to the choir.\"\n\nCzerwinski, a Democrat who owns a rock-climbing gym in the area, had called Kelly's office multiple times since the start of the Trump administration. And when Kelly told the audience to leave voicemails to senators as a way to make their voices heard, she shouted: \"Yours is full!\"\n\nThe swing state's two Democratic senators ducked an attendee's shouted question about whether they support removing Schumer from his leadership post after his public support for the spending measure last week. \"We're focusing on this right now,\" Gallego said, noting the town hall was billed as one focused on what Democrats characterize as a Republican push to cut Medicaid spending.\n\nQuianna Brown, who said her 10-year-old daughter's Medicaid coverage is at risk now that she is no longer in the foster system, pushed back on the senators who described cuts to Medicaid as yet to be determined.\n\n\"What do we do? We feel incredibly powerless trying to plan for our family. We can't wait until it's done. We need to know how to prepare what may come down the hatch. We are trying to shield ourselves before we're wounded, and we don't know how,\" Brown said.\n\nKelly described Brown's story as \"incredibly powerful\" and asked for her name in order to share it with Republicans in Washington. Gallego said Democrats \"would all love to be able to snap our fingers right now and have that solution, but it's not going to happen that way.\"\n\n\"We have to fight them down. We have to grind them to the point where they give up on this fight. Because if you give an inch, they will take it all,\" he said.\n\nAfter the event, Brown told CNN she appreciated the senators hearing her out but wasn't satisfied. \"I wanted more. I think as a parent at any time when you feel that you can't protect your kid, you want a game plan. Like what is the plan?\" she said.\n\nThe senators, she told CNN following the event, were being \"too business as usual.\"\n\nJefri Knazan, who had taught in Canada but returned to the United States for family reasons and is currently on Medicaid, was so frustrated by how the senators answered Brown that she changed her question to push them to \"be straight with us\" on how to take the fight \"to the next level.\"\n\nMultiple attendees took their blunt assessments even further in conversations with CNN, saying the party lacks a clear leader and an effective message.\n\n\"I don't think showing up with hand fans at a speech does much,\" said retired Navy veteran Tom Dyson, referring to signs Democratic lawmakers held up during Trump's address to a joint session of Congress earlier this month. \"I think you have to take action. I think you have to speak out.\"\n\nFor retiree Donald Bandy, frustration with the Democratic Party is an \"understatement.\"\n\n\"We don't seem to be organized. We don't have a coalition. We don't have any power. Republicans control everything and everyone's afraid of Trump. It's what he says goes,\" Bandy said.\n\nAt a town hall for Ivey, the second-term Democratic congressman, held in Forestville, Maryland, attendees lambasted the role Democrats, particularly Schumer, played in helping congressional Republicans approve the continuing resolution to avert a government shutdown.\n\n\"The message that was sent by Democrats in Congress with the CR catastrophe was clear,\" a man who identified himself as John told Ivey. \"It's not that you are in the minority, it's that you aren't even working together on a shared strategy. And that is failure.\"\n\nIvey listened as the man continued, raising his voice.\n\n\"We are not interested in hearing that you are in the minority - we know that!\" John yelled into the mic. \"We want you to show some of the backbone and strategic brilliance that Mitch McConnell would have in the minority. We want you to show fight and you are not fighting!\"\n\nAnother constituent, Donya Williams, complained Ivey didn't know the people in his district well enough - because he admitted earlier that he didn't know who popular podcaster Joe Rogan was until the middle of the 2024 presidential campaign.\n\n\"You don't know anything about a podcast, and as a Democratic (lawmaker) who's representing all of these people, you don't know how to reach them,\" Williams said. \"So therefore, you don't know us.\"\n\nIvey countered that he and other members of Congress are trying to do more to connect with younger voters on social media. \"The key is to make sure that we turn to each other and not on each other in doing the outreach,\" he said.\n\nIvey kept his composure throughout the evening, drawing a compliment from one woman. But then she, too, turned critical: \"We need you to be less polite.\"\n\nIn the Chicago suburb of Downers Grove, attendees at Casten's town hall Wednesday night were largely complimentary of the congressman's opposition to Trump. But, they told CNN before the town hall got underway, they were furious with Sen. Dick Durbin's vote to advance the spending measure last week.\n\n\"Dick Durbin needs to be primaried in two years,\" said Ben Holinga, a 43-year-old salesman and Democratic voter from nearby Willowbrook.\n\n\"I'm very upset with how Democrats in the Senate handled the continuing resolution,\" he said. \"They should try actually fighting for once. They should try to actually be the opposition party.\"\n\nRick Lunt, a 68-year-old retiree and Democratic voter from Palos Hills, said he is happy with Casten and \"wanted to be here to show him support.\" But he said he'd like to see Democrats take more measures to show their opposition to Trump, even if they are purely symbolic.\n\nDemocrats could, he said, \"propose a resolution of impeachment or something\" to remove Trump from office - acknowledging that \"sometimes just a symbolic effort, movement on that part, is enough to inspire the rest of us.\"\n\nCasten's town hall was repeatedly interrupted by pro-Palestinian protesters - with one protester who declined to share his name with CNN climbing on stage and refusing to leave.\n\nChants of \"Casten\" and \"leave, leave, leave\" rang through the room as some sought to drown out the protests, but after more than 45 minutes of interruptions, local police asked the congressman to end his event.\n\n\"The consequence of what you're doing is that the good people in this room are going to decide not to come to town halls anymore,\" Casten told protesters, \"because it's not productive.\"\n\nCNN's Ariel Edwards-Levy and Danny Freeman contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Democrats' first big chance to check Trump may make them look even weaker\n\nFollow:\n\nWashington Democrats finally have a first point of leverage against President Donald Trump - but it comes with a dilemma that could leave them looking even more hapless than they have so far in his second term.\n\nThe pressure point arises over a temporary government funding bill that could provide cover for the president's anti-government purge and as Democratic voters pine for their lawmakers to show some fight .\n\nAhead of a critical Senate vote, Democratic leaders face a paradoxical choice: Should they shut down the government to try to save it? That gamble could come with a significant downside, as shuttered agencies and thousands of furloughed federal workers could be left even more vulnerable to the metaphorical chainsaw wielded by Elon Musk .\n\nDemocrats' choices will play out against a backdrop of mounting frustration from progressives, whose despair after the 2024 election has turned to horror as Trump has turned Washington upside down in his first 50 days in office and set about fracturing the liberal world order that has prevailed for 80 years.\n\nDemocrats were widely mocked for their ineffectual protests that underscored their impotence during Trump's joint address to Congress earlier this month, when some wore color-coordinated dress and others held up paddles bearing anti-Trump slogans.\n\nPennsylvania Democratic volunteer Bobbi Erickson wants her party's leaders to be far more aggressive in taking on Trump. \"We are watching the Constitution burn. We are watching the country that we love be systematically dismantled,\" Erickson told CNN's Eva McKend, whose recent trip to the commonwealth revealed extreme impatience among grassroots Democrats.\n\nBack in Washington, party leaders have a chance to show some steel.\n\nHistory shows that Republicans usually get the blame for the kind of partial government shutdown that will begin at midnight Friday unless the Senate approves new spending to keep it open.\n\nBut Trump and Musk, with their stunning moves to shred the federal machine , have scrambled political logic, leaving both parties gaming out novel calculations that have changed the politics of shutdown dramas.\n\nThe House of Representatives set up the one-two GOP punch by passing a bill to freeze spending at current levels until the end of September - while adjusting where money is allocated to prioritize Trump's priorities, such as border enforcement. The House then promptly left town, leaving the mess for the Senate to sort out.\n\nDemocrats fear this stopgap bill will simply provide another six months for Trump and Musk to widen the Department of Government Efficiency's plan to fire thousands of workers and close entire federal departments. But in theory, they can block it by refusing to give the GOP probably eight votes needed to reach a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. The need for 60-vote thresholds for most bills is the only lever the Democrats can pull in the capital to slow or moderate Trump's actions.\n\n\"I'm going to vote against what came over from the House Republicans to the Senate last night because I don't want to give my vote to support what Trump and Musk are doing,\" Delaware Sen. Chris Coons told \"CNN News Central\" Wednesday.\n\nBut if Democrats take this path, they'll be closing down the government at the very time Trump is trying to destroy it.\n\nSen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat, told CNN's Kaitlan Collins on Tuesday that he'd not yet decided how to vote. But he sees downsides to a shutdown that go beyond inflicting even more hardship on federal workers. \"If it shuts down, what is Elon Musk going to allow to open back up? That's a big concern of mine,\" Kelly said. \"How many more veterans is Elon, and this administration, going to fire? So, there's not a good option here.\"\n\nSenate Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer sought to break Democrats out of their unenviable political box on Wednesday, warning that the 60 votes needed to pass the funding bill do not yet exist. He called for a separate one-month extension with identical spending allocations as those currently in force to allow for bipartisan negotiations. \"We should vote on that. I hope, I hope our Republican colleagues will join us to avoid a shutdown on Friday,\" Schumer said on Wednesday.\n\nBut there's no chance the GOP, basking in its monopoly on Washington power, will \"join\" with the minority party.  So, it's fair to ask whether Schumer is taking a stand for effect in the expectation that enough of his members will eventually vote to keep the government open - while allowing the bulk of his party to cast a symbolic but politically useful vote against Trump.\n\nRepublicans are relishing the spectacle after setting their trap.\n\n\"Chuck Schumer has a big decision to make. Is he going to pass the bill to keep the government open? Or is he going to be blamed for shutting it down,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson told Fox News on Wednesday. The Louisiana Republican held his tiny majority together to pass the stopgap bill in a feat that demonstrated Trump's huge influence . Johnson is obviously enjoying flinging exactly the same lines at Democrats as he and his GOP colleagues have faced for years in shutdown sagas.\n\nThe next two days will be deeply painful experience for Democrats. \"I hate the House bill,\" Sen. John Hickenlooper told CNN's Manu Raju. But the Colorado Democrat was leaning toward voting for the measure despite warning that it would give Trump more time to jam through the sweeping government cuts that are \"exactly what we've been fighting against.\" However, on Wednesday evening, he said in a video on X he had decided to vote against the Republicans' short-term funding extension, arguing it would give Trump more power to undermine spending authority granted to Congress by the Constitution.\n\nThe arguments for mounting a Senate blockade even at the risk of a government shutdown are mostly rooted in the opportunity for Democrats to show some resistance to the most disruptive first 100 days in modern presidential history.\n\nDemocrats would also be hoping to put pressure on Johnson and to make him face a backlash for sending his members home. They'd hope either to gain some concessions that could slow the Trump juggernaut or to open fissures in the tiny GOP House majority that could be important in later, more critical fights.\n\nPennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman is one of the few Democrats to openly argue for passing the stopgap bill - after previously irking some grassroots members of his party by accommodating some of Trump's policies and nominees.\n\n\"If you shut it down, you will impact and hurt millions and millions and millions of Americans, and you run the risk of slipping us into a recession or even all kinds of other things,\" Fetterman told CNN's Manu Raju on Wednesday. \"Remember what you were voting for. You were voting to shut the government down, and that will absolutely punish millions, millions of Americans,\" Fetterman said.\n\nFetterman's attitude will look like an abdication to many Democrats who have been demanding tougher action from their representatives in Washington. But it also underscores one unpalatable fact the party is constantly forced to face: It lacks the power to make a real impact. The earliest that can change is the midterm elections in 2026, when Democrats hope historical precedents will hold firm and they'll recapture the House and the power to check the incumbent president.\n\nBut their odds of overturning the GOP's current 53-47 edge in the Senate are problematic, with only two Republican-held seats, in Maine and North Carolina, sure bets to be competitive, and with several incumbent Democrats looking vulnerable. The equation became even more daunting Wednesday when Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire - a state that only narrowly went to Democrats in the 2024 presidential election - announced she will not run for reelection , opening a competitive race for her seat.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "'Use your power': Hakeem Jeffries at a crossroads as Democrats urgently search for strategy\n\nFollow:\n\nNancy Pelosi privately offered some advice for Hakeem Jeffries as Democrats devolved into bitter infighting over a government funding bill reviled by much of their party.\n\n\"Use your power,\" she told him in an hour-long sit down in his office earlier this month, telling Jeffries to flex his muscle with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and sharpen their party's strategy with a shutdown looming, according to a person briefed on their conversation.\n\nAfter a week back home where Democrats took an earful from their voters demanding they hold a tougher line with President Donald Trump, Jeffries is facing new pressure to forgo his cautious demeanor and lead the charge against the White House - and take the reins of his party's strategy from Schumer.\n\nRelated article 'Try actually fighting': Democrats face voters' fury at town halls\n\n\"He's gonna have to lead, or Chuck leads. This is his moment, so step up,\" said one senior House Democrat who is close to Jeffries and was granted anonymity to speak candidly. \"He's always bowed to Schumer, and I think that's gonna end.\"\n\nThe role of serving as the House's top Democrat under a Republican president is a new one for Jeffries. Indeed, it was Pelosi - having served as speaker battling President George W. Bush and also during Trump's first term - who often drove her party's strategy.\n\nAnd in the aftermath of Jeffries breaking with Schumer over the GOP funding bill, and as Trump challenges the limits of his power, House Democrats say it's Jeffries' time to step up and help articulate a badly needed vision for a party in crisis, according to interviews with more than two dozen members and operatives.\n\n\"We need to have a strategy, and it can't be surrender,\" Rep. Jared Huffman of California said in an interview. As for Jeffries, he said: \"I think he understood the moment.\"\n\nWith polls showing their party's standing with the American public at record lows and lacking a national leader, Democrats say the mission is growing more urgent by the day, fearful that without a new approach they could see their chances at winning back the House majority slip away in next year's critical midterm elections. Already, some Democrats are pushing for a new policy agenda like the ones offered ahead of the 2006 and 2018 midterms, two cycles where Democrats took the House pledging to check GOP presidents.\n\n\"We gotta show people we are willing to stand up,\" said Rep. Debbie Dingell of Michigan, adding that Democrats \"have to be willing to cut waste and fraud\" but also defend key government programs.\n\n\"People are scared, they are angry,\" she said. \"We have to protect the programs that people rely on.\"\n\nIn his third year leading House Democrats, Jeffries is now facing his biggest national moment yet. And it comes at a politically vulnerable time for him personally. Before Schumer's crisis of confidence , Jeffries' leadership had also been the subject of questions from a divided House caucus and party base.\n\n\"He's never been in the position like this before,\" said one senior House Democratic member, who said Jeffries \"has had to adjust\" and has been \"slow\" at times to tap into the anger from the Democratic base.\n\nAs Congress was staring at a government shutdown earlier this month, Jeffries rallied his caucus to try unite against the GOP spending bill, a position that unraveled as Schumer effectively allowed the measure to pass the Senate fearing a potential shutdown. But in a private meeting earlier this month, multiple battleground Democrats confronted Jeffries' top spending leader, Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro, about how they would explain to the American public what exactly they wanted from a shutdown.\n\nRep. Steven Horsford - a Nevada Democrat and longtime leadership ally - was stern, warning DeLauro that the party needed a strong message if the party was willing to go over the edge, as the room grew silent, according to two people who attended the meeting.\n\n\"I think the best thing that happened to Jeffries is Schumer bungling this so much,\" another Democratic member added. \"Prior to this, there was a lot of unhappiness and rumblings in the caucus about him.\"\n\nMost urgently in the coming days, Jeffries will face the task of blunting his fractured party's circular firing squad, harnessing the anger against his fellow New York leader and tossing it back at Trump. House Democrats have sharply criticized Schumer, with some saying it could be time for new leadership. As a result, headlines have focused on Democratic infighting instead of Trump dismantling another federal department.\n\nBehind the scenes, talks are already underway between Jeffries and Schumer to align their political strategy on the coming battles against Trump. The immediate fight for Democrats will be trying to derail Trump's sweeping tax, border and spending cuts package - a strategy the two New York Democrats discussed in a private phone call last week where they sought to sharpen their party's focus against the prospects of deep cuts to Medicaid.\n\nAnd then in the fall, there will be yet another funding fight over keeping the government open, with the possibility that their votes could also be needed this summer to raise the debt limit - more fronts where Democrats could have leverage.\n\nIn his first caucus-wide conversation after Schumer's spending concession to Trump, Jeffries told members he had a \"frank and honest\" conversation with the Senate party leader about unity going forward, according to two people who listened to the call. He said he \"disagreed\" with Schumer's decision to back down from a funding fight with Trump - even though some House Democrats now privately acknowledge that their Senate counterpart probably prevented an even bigger political headache.\n\nBut he also stressed that in future fights, Democrats \"need to be united\" - a cue to end the intraparty fighting.\n\n\"We don't have the luxury of devolving into the fight of who the Senate Democratic leadership will be at this moment,\" Huffman added. \"We got to make sure our tactics are better aligned.\"\n\nCNN's Edward-Isaac Dovere contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Inside and outside the Senate, Democrats begin to lose faith in Schumer\n\nFollow:\n\nDemocrats have long found the flip phone Chuck Schumer still insists on using as an endearing quirk that illustrates how committed he is to his way of talking to all sorts of allies, all the time.\n\nAfter how he handled the spending fight, many inside and outside the Capitol are starting to see that phone as a metaphor for a leader who's out of date and refusing to change as politics changes radically around him.\n\n\"This is not the first time that members of the caucus expressed frustration that he wasn't as inclusive as he could have been on decision making or strategy, but the stakes of this particular vote were huge,\" said one Senate Democrat, who like others, is still wary of going public with attacks on the leader.\n\nBut CNN's conversations with three-dozen Democratic senators, members of the House, top aides and other prominent leaders detail a cratering of support, with many starting to feel that he can't be the party's future and shouldn't be their present.\n\n\"If he doesn't lose it between now and then, he won't be leader in two years,\" said another Democratic senator, who added, looking ahead to the next expected Congressional showdown, \"he can't be trusted alone to negotiate the debt limit.\"\n\nIn a video he blasted out to his supporters Friday night, longtime Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders - an independent who caucuses with the Democrats - called the situation \"an absolute failure of Democratic leadership.\" In a video he blasted out to his own supporters, freshman California Sen. Adam Schiff called it \"a bad day for our country - and for the Democratic Party.\"\n\n\"Schumer tried to be too smart,\" said another Democratic senator, \"but he ended up looking indecisive.\"\n\nSchumer and the nine Democrats who voted with him on Friday say they were making the responsible decision between two horrible choices. Option one: advance a bill full of major cuts and leeway for Trump's administration to reallocate billions of funds for their own purposes. Option two: enable a shutdown which could have stretched on indefinitely while Trump officials flexed executive authority over spending in ways they would find even more devastating, not to mention leaving tens of thousands of federal workers without pay and millions more without services.\n\nBut critics from across traditional Democratic divides of ideology, geography and age see a pile of excuses and false choices. They say Schumer flubbed weeks of strategy, essentially negotiating with himself for less to make the final bill worse than they could have gotten it to be with better pushback. They say he mismanaged dynamics internally with colleagues and publicly so that he ended up delivering a fresh round of dejection to a party already slumping on the ropes.\n\nAny Democrat paying attention knew this week of negotiations was going to be terrible for them. But, many say, it was Schumer's leadership that left them looking and feeling even worse-and with much less leverage for future fight, now that Senate Republicans saw how easy it was to write what Trump wants into the bills, make no effort to reach out to Democrats, and watch them be the ones to attack each other.\n\n\"Republicans saw Democrats were weak, and thought, 'We're going to call your bluff'-and they were right,\" said a top aide to one Senate Democrat. \"This was always going to be no-win. But it didn't have to be this much of an 'L'.\"\n\nAs Trump got exactly the bill he wanted while losing only two Republican votes combined between the House and Senate, Schumer has lost faith among several of his Democratic senators for being able to manage the fights ahead. He left several of his own senators distrusting others in their own caucus. Several Democratic governors, who have privately been knocking Schumer as inept for weeks, finished Friday feeling more validated than they ever wanted to be.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries was not just frustrated by what played out, but annoyed that Schumer-who otherwise calls multiple times a day to check in on everything from strategy to tweets-barely talked to him about any of this over the last few weeks, according to several House Democratic sources. Always deliberate with his words, the only answer the fellow New Yorker would give on Friday when asked by CNN if he thought a change in Senate leadership was needed was, \"next question.\"\n\nOutside the Capitol, many Democratic assessments of Schumer are much harsher.\n\n\"Democrats need a leader who is up to the moment both in terms of willingness to fight and ability to communicate about that willingness to fight. I don't think at this point Senator Schumer has had either,\" said Amanda Litman, the co-founder of the group Run for Something, which helps younger and newer Democratic candidates put together campaigns on the local level.\n\nA leader of a major Democratic-aligned organization, for now reluctant to exacerbate the party fractures by speaking publicly, said Schumer has now made himself irrelevant.\n\n\"The biggest impact of this last week is that from now on, the broad spectrum of the Democratic Party, from the center to the left, will be looking to the House for leadership,\" that person told CNN on Friday afternoon.\n\nSchumer sees what he did, by contrast, as truly grappling with how different Trump is as a president now, versus when they had their showdown fights in his first term. Then, Schumer said repeatedly in conversations, Trump wasn't looking for pretexts to fire federal government workers. Then, Schumer also said, Republican leaders in Congress were trying to avoid a shutdown, while now he saw them as egging one on in a way that he feared meant they wouldn't have allowed government to re-open anytime soon.\n\n\"Once you shut down the government, it is totally up to DOGE and Trump and Musk how long we're in shutdown,\" Schumer said in an interview with Jake Tapper on CNN on Friday evening. \"We could have been in shutdown for months, and why did Musk and Trump want to shut down? Because they wanted this power to achieve their goal of dramatically shrinking, destroying, hurting innocent people in the government.\"\n\nSo Schumer's thinking going into the week, several people familiar with it told CNN, was trying to avoid letting House Speaker Mike Johnson use him as a foil-being clearer with his position, the Senate leader thought, would make it easier to line up House Republican votes. He also felt he was giving Jeffries the maximum amount of space to unite against the bill. And he figured this Republican leadership wouldn't make any real concessions on the bill no matter what he did.\n\nFor three days in a row leading up to the vote, Schumer held long lunch meetings for the Senate Democrats to air their grievances and opinions about what to do. To many of the senators stewing and steaming through them, this felt like not having a strategy-to the point that one senator, according to a colleague, spoke up to say that even former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, despite being constantly mutinied against by his own Republican colleagues, managed to get a meeting with then-President Joe Biden during their 2023 debt limit fight.\n\nSchumer has told allies he saw these lunches as his strategy, trying to let colleagues coalesce around which of the bad options they felt was worse by arguing with each other, but without his twisting arms either way. He didn't want a shutdown. He felt like Democrats would lose the political fight over one. But he says he wanted his colleagues to get there themselves.\n\nHe also called multiple senators into his office to tell them they had to convince particular colleagues to vote yes, and urged several leaders of Democratic-leaning organizations to tamp down their rhetoric pushing for a shutdown.\n\nAnd when Schumer announced his own yes vote, it was not just within a day of floating an alternative strategy-he even surprised one of his closest allies, according to multiple senators: Washington Sen. Patty Murray, the ranking member on the Appropriations Committee and far from a standard resistance figure. She ended up voting no.\n\nHouse Democrats were bewildered themselves by the suggestion that Schumer was doing them any favors. Several joined the nearly unanimous Democratic vote against the Republican budget bill not because they wanted a shutdown, but because they thought they were giving the Senate more leverage. Others were convinced that they needed to be part of a unified Democratic effort.\n\nSeveral close to Jeffries himself, meanwhile, scoff at Schumer's suggesting that House Democrats didn't think Johnson would pass the bill, arguing the senator doesn't get how much obedience to Trump has come to define Republicans in Congress. They think Schumer never understood Jeffries's strategy was to push for the fight since he was convinced Democrats could win, and worried about the policy and political consequences of putting a rubber stamp on the Republican bill.\n\nAt a panel of union leaders at their retreat, Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro asked them to call Schumer to remind him that they supported a \"No\" vote. Several did. Schumer told those he spoke with he still felt confident he was right.\n\nLater in that same strategy session, another House Democrat vented more broadly: \"What's Chuck Schumer thinking?\"\n\nAnother voice shouted back from the crowd, \"Of himself!\"\n\nMany members started to clap and cheer, according to two people in the room.\n\n\"The relationship is broken,\" one House Democratic member told CNN. \"The anger is so strong right now that the future is hard to imagine.\"\n\nSchumer's fellow New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who in 2017 stood out for voting against every one of Trump's Cabinet nominees, by Thursday's lunch of Senate Democrats was speaking so loudly in favor of voting Yes to advance the government funding bill that reporters outside could her through the walls.\n\nGillibrand is the chair of the Senate Democrats' campaign arm for the 2026 elections. After voting yes, despite a detailed justification she argued in a press release from her office on Friday, several of her colleagues and Democratic operatives told CNN they did not see how she could credibly appeal to donors and voters who wanted more of a fight.\n\n\"We are confident we will have the resources we need to win,\" an aide to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee told CNN. \"When given an explanation, donors are receptive and understand the negative consequences of a shutdown.\"\n\nOthers sympathetic to Schumer and Gillibrand argued to CNN that it's hard to believe the intricacies of a procedural vote in March 2025 will really shape the 2026 midterms, especially because by the fall Democrats are expecting Republicans to push through a bill to enact much of Trump's agenda that includes sweeping tax cuts and deep spending reductions on programs like Medicare without requiring a single Democratic vote, which they think will unify both Democratic officials and their supporters.\n\nBut with Senate Democrats acknowledging they probably don't have enough opportunities in races to get to the majority even in their best case scenario for 2026, they are hoping to get there by 2028. By then, Schumer would be 77, in Washington for as long as Joe Biden had been when he was elected president, and have weathered years of compromises with Trump. He'd also have had to run for a sixth term that would keep him in office until his mid-80s.\n\nChatter about who will be the next Senate leader was whipping around Washington long before this week-though the focus of much speculation, Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz, ultimately joined Schumer in voting \"Yes.\"\n\nAnd while multiple senators declined CNN's interview requests because, they said, they wanted to be able to tell Schumer they weren't involved in questioning his future, some of the No votes stood by him publicly.\n\n\"Schumer is a senator as well, and every one of us has to make these tough decisions,\" New Mexico Sen. Ben Ray Luján said on Friday. When asked if he questioned the New Yorker's leadership, he said, \"I support Chuck Schumer.\"\n\nRepublicans \"own the pain that will result from this Continuing Resolution, and they will own the disastrous effects of cutting Medicaid and Social Security-which they call a Ponzi scheme. We need to be ready for the fight ahead and redouble our efforts, and be unified,\" said Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, also a No vote.\n\nAsked if he had any concerns about Schumer's leadership going forward, Blumenthal answered without giving a yes or no, but insisted that was only because his only focus was Friday's vote.\n\nOr there was Colorado Sen. John Hickenlooper's response when asked on Friday afternoon if he had a message to those Democrats outside the Senate so outraged that they're calling on Schumer to resign: \"Oh, I don't have a message\"\n\nCNN's Sarah Ferris and Manu Raju contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "'These aren't normal times': Frustrated Democrats demand their leaders do more to meet the moment\n\nFollow:\n\nOn a Friday afternoon in downtown Philadelphia, dozens gather on the corner of South 2nd and Chestnut streets. A mix of retirees and fired federal workers, they are teeming with fury, but not just toward President Donald Trump , Elon Musk and the early actions of the administration.\n\nThey are also acutely angry at a fellow Democrat: Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania.\n\nThese people represent the roughly 73% of Democratic voters in a recent CNN/SSRS poll who say the party's caucus in Congress is doing too little to oppose Trump. In their view, Fetterman and other Washington Democrats are enabling illegal firings across the federal workforce and the erosion of the rule of law.\n\n\"I understand the importance of bipartisanship in normal times. But these aren't normal times,\" said Robert Lipartito, a 69-year-old retired music librarian from Pennsport.\n\nLipartito argues the party needs to be more dogmatic and is not sympathetic to the needle that purple-state Democrats believe they must thread. \"It's not just a matter of trying to find consensus when someone is literally dismantling our institutions right before our eyes and turning on our allies. I mean, there's no middle ground for that,\" he said.\n\nRelated article Tracking Trump's overhaul of the federal workforce\n\nThe group of protesters, organized by a local offshoot of Indivisible, a progressive movement created in 2016 after Trump first took the White House, marched from Fetterman's Philadelphia field office to Independence National Historic Park chanting \"Stand up for us\" as people passing by honked and cheered.\n\n\"If we elected you, then you need to fight, you need to grow a spine and fight for us,\" said 64-year-old Joyce Meder of Abington Township. Meder, dressed in a Fetterman costume, held a sign calling on her senator to hold a town hall to hear constituents' concerns and to show up for votes.\n\nDemocrats have begun sounding the alarm over Republican plans to pay for extensions of tax cuts by slashing hundreds of billions of dollars in government spending, possibly including cuts to Medicaid .\n\nMore immediately, the federal government will shut down Friday if Congress doesn't pass funding legislation. Democrats are weighing whether they should help pass a GOP-drafted spending measure that they dislike or whether they should demand some concessions in exchange for their support.\n\nFetterman has always ruled out supporting a government shutdown as a mechanism to slow down the Trump agenda.\n\n\"That's chaos. I'll never vote for chaos. To burn the village down in order to save it ... that's one of our core responsibilities to keep the government running,\" Fetterman told CNN.\n\nIt's not just progressives who are peeved.\n\nLongtime Philadelphia attorney Michelle Flamer describes herself as a centrist. Still, she feels compelled to protest her own party because the people she voted for, she says, should feel accountable to her. \"In my view, our nation's on fire and we are actually in a constitutional crisis now,\" the 68-year-old said in an interview on her porch in West Philadelphia.\n\nShe was in disbelief when House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries wondered at a news conference last month how much power Democrats have in Trump's Washington.\n\n\"I'm trying to figure out what leverage we actually have. What leverage do we have?\" Jeffries asked. \"Republicans have repeatedly lectured America. They control the House, the Senate and the presidency. It's their government.\"\n\nJeffries was trying to indicate it was not on Democrats to bail out Speaker Mike Johnson on government spending negotiations since Republicans are in the majority. His message: Democrats would work with Johnson on a bipartisan basis, but conservatives must take responsibility for whatever materialized.\n\nSome Democratic voters received Jeffries' comment as party leaders prematurely conceding defeat.\n\n\"In the middle 1800s, if you look at Philadelphia, we had 20,000 free Black people living in Philadelphia at the time. They were very much engaged in Underground Railroad activities. How much power did they have?\" Flamer said.\n\n\"But still these people persevered. It's a matter of persistence,\" added Flamer.\n\nMany Democrats want more from their party. In Clarion, local Democratic organizers are strategizing to find candidates to mount primary challenges against sitting Democrats they say are failing them.\n\nTheir message? Fight harder. Gum up the works. Throw up every conceivable procedural roadblock. Stop confirming Trump's nominees. And do a better job messaging to conservatives in rural America about how they too could be harmed by Trump's policies.\n\n\"Well, they definitely need to be doing all of the procedural warfare. ... Just everything they can do to obstruct anything that's harmful to Americans,\" said Kali McLaughlin, who lives with multiple sclerosis but still works to turn out voters in her rural community.\n\nAware of the unrest among the party faithful, Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin and Jeffries held a national call last week to lay out actions they are taking to address voter concerns.\n\n\"We have a plan and we understand that we need to execute it with the fierce urgency of now,\" Jeffries said as he detailed a road map that included using the courts to stall Trump's agenda and a messaging battle to persuade voters so Democrats can recapture the House.\n\nThe raw anger from Democratic voters isn't just concentrated in urban centers. The outrage is palpable in rural America, too.\n\nIn her 30s, Bobbi Erickson is a funny and feisty cook at an elementary school in Jefferson County, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn the two hours between the time she clocks out and when she gets her son off the bus after school, she volunteers by collecting signatures, organizing rallies and knocking on doors for local Democrats.\n\n\"There's a war being waged in America, in rural Pennsylvania, and we're fighting and we're scrapping every single day to get volunteers, to get Democrats on the ballot, to get votes out. We're scrapping every day, and if they would work half as hard as we do, I would have no complaints,\" Erickson said.\n\nShe said cuts to Medicaid and nutritional assistance programs would decimate her community.\n\n\"We already don't have hospitals. We already have places where you have to drive over an hour to get to a maternity ward. ... We already don't get the care that we need in these areas, and we need someone to fight for us,\" Erickson said.\n\nHer school is one of the thousands with a federally funded Head Start program, which provides child care and early education services to low-income families across America.\n\nThe program has been thrown into uncertainty since the Trump administration froze its federal funding, a decision that's being litigated in federal court.\n\nErickson worked hard to get Fetterman elected in 2022, even dressing up as a broccoli in a Fetterman campaign video to poke fun at his rival, Dr. Mehmet Oz.\n\n\"I think if he put in half the work I did to get him elected right now, I wouldn't be showing up at his office and protesting him,\" she said.\n\nWhen CNN reached out to Fetterman to ask him about the discontent among some Democratic voters in his state, including over his support for confirming Attorney General Pam Bondi, he pushed back against the premise.\n\n\"There's a lot of Democrats in Pennsylvania,\" Fetterman said, adding that he wouldn't act like members of his party who held up signs during Trump's recent address to Congress. \"I'm not going to be one of those guys, but my values haven't changed, and I'm going to be a reliable Democrat. I'm going to keep fighting for wins in Pennsylvania.\"\n\nAbigail Grimes-Haldiman of Elk County often joins Erickson knocking on doors. As a transgender woman, she feels the weight of this political moment but won't cower, believing it is her \"duty as a citizen\" to canvass for causes and candidates aligned with her values. She grew up in a split political household, so she understands the complexity of coexisting with various ideological views. But when it comes to her own identity, she wishes Democrats would have more of a backbone.\n\n\"The Democrats have allowed the Republicans to take that narrative away from us and for us to be demonized to the point that everyone thinks there's going to be a trans person that's going to attack you on the corner when we're less than one and a half percent of the population,\" she said.\n\nFrustrations like that are why some Democrats are training their ire on their own party.\n\n\"We're the ones that put them in office, right?\" McLaughlin said. \"We're kind of responsible for them. That's who we should be going after.\"\n\nCNN's Andrew Seger and Morgan Rimmer contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

      "text": "Democrats confront their powerlessness as Trump flexes authority\n\nFollow:\n\nAmid Democrats' shock and bickering over how much to respond to President Donald Trump is a deeper question rippling through leaders across the Capitol and across the country: How much should they rely on the same institutional and procedural maneuvers they used during the first Trump term, and how much are they willing to wield their own wrecking balls?\n\nDemocrats remain essentially leaderless, with prospective future presidential candidates largely sitting back and allowing others to be the first ones through the buzzsaw of Trump and his cheerleaders, none eager to be the face of a party just yet. They are disconnected from the Democratic National Committee, where the Obama-era rallying cry of \"Yes We Can!\" became the watered down facsimile slogan \"Yes We Ken!\" for Ken Martin, the largely unknown insider who emerged as the winner of the recent chair race that the party's most prominent figures avoided.\n\nThose Democrats left trying to take charge doubt the slower court challenges can keep up with the rapid, precision onslaught mounting each day from presidential appointees and associates of Elon Musk . For whatever judgments do come out in their favor, many believe - though few will yet say so publicly - that Trump may soon just start ignoring what he doesn't like, and they'll have no recourse.\n\nTrump dismissed this on Tuesday, telling reporters in the Oval Office, \"I always abide by the courts,\" just days after Vice President JD Vance had tweeted, \"Judges aren't allowed to control the executive's legitimate power\" - and days before Trump posted on Saturday, \"He who saves his country does not violate any law,\" a line nearly matching one that appeared in a 1970 movie about Napoleon.\n\nRelated article Here's what federal judges could do if they're ignored by the Trump administration\n\nWhat hopes Democrats have to counter Trump rest for now on the mid-March government budget deadline, the first real inflection point for a party that is not just in the minority in the House and Senate, but facing a Republican majority so in thrall to the president that they cheer him on as he rapidly absorbs powers from Congress, while they're left holding contrived attempts to visit buildings that Trump and Musk have locked shut while they dismantle operations inside.\n\n\"I'm not going to stand by and support an effort to dismantle our democracy through the budgeting process,\" said Rep. Hank Johnson, a Georgia Democrat, as he left a rally outside the offices of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to protest its overnight shuttering by the White House, where he and two dozen colleagues pledged not to vote for any bill until, as the co-founder of the group Indivisible put it, \"this Constitutional crisis is over.\"\n\nJohnson argued that the whole mentality is different from the December shutdown threat, when Democrats also complained but ultimately provided enough votes to make up for Republican defections even though they got limited concessions. \"We've got to do everything we can, every tool in the toolbox to oppose what is actually happening right before our eyes,\" he said.\n\nThat kind of emergency protocol is crashing into Democrats in the House and Senate who remain confident history will repeat.\n\n\"I remember eight years ago when skeptical reporters were seeing protests and said, 'Oh come on, it's almost two years until the midterms, will people really stay engaged and energized? The answer proved to be yes. And in fact, the numbers even grew,\" said Pennsylvania Rep. Brendan Boyle, as he headed on Thursday to a long hearing over the budget that Democrats hope lets them win back some ground.\n\nOthers argue they have to be the ones to hold the institutions in place, keeping their resistance within bounds of forcing debates through the night on votes they are going to lose and rallies in front of buildings that Trump has locked them out of, where they say things like \"a rally a day keeps the fascists away,\" as Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin did at the CFPB rally, and then head home again with their signs.\n\n\"Clearly this is a man that is driving an agenda that's breaking the law, violating civil service laws, violating common sense, violating fiscal prudence, benefiting corrupt practices,\" said New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, when asked by CNN if he thought Democrats were doing as much as he wants to push back on the president.\n\n\"You pull every lever that you have on things that you disagree on, but I have to say, this idea that to shut the whole place down...\" Booker said, his voice trailing off, and then affirming he does not support any kind of government shutdown. \"The levers that we have are limited, but at the same time, all of us share the lever of speaking out, of raising popular sentiment.\"\n\nFor top Democrats in and out of elected office, every day is an existential tug-of-war between worrying about sounding like shrill paranoiacs and worrying that they are not saying or doing nearly enough. They don't know what the next three-and-a-half years are supposed to be when they already hit \"Constitutional crisis\" in the first three-and-a-half weeks.\n\n\"The reason people feel angry about what's happening is not because we're not doing everything in our power,\" argued Rep. Sean Casten, a Democrat from Illinois. \"It's because they're wondering, when in God's name did it become partisan to defend the Constitution? Why is it partisan to say that it's bad to give Nazi salutes? Why is it partisan to say the Reconstruction amendments that provide equal protection for all are not worth defending anymore?\"\n\nCasten, like several of his House Democratic colleagues who spoke to CNN, said he has been surprised and heartened by how many constituents have been calling into tele-town halls, and by the responses he has been hearing: \"In three weeks, the public mood has gone from apathy to fear to anger. And I think the next thing in that cycle is action.\"\n\nBut Casten said that activist leaders have told him and colleagues that they fear protests against Trump might eventually be used as a predicate for declaring martial law. Other House Democrats echoed this privately, and several left-leaning activist group leaders told CNN directly that their own safety concerns for participants have risen since the president's blanket pardons for January 6 rioters.\n\n\"It only took 50 days for Hitler to destroy democracy in Germany,\" Casten said, arguing that there are direct parallels to those moves and much of what Trump is doing. \"Part of our job right now as Democrats in Washington inside of this is to be Churchillian, very clear-eyed about what the stakes of this moment are, what the parallels in history are, remind people that the majority of Americans are good people, and that the way you shut a bully down is to punch back.\"\n\nTrump aides regularly dismiss comments like this.\n\nOn Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt claimed Democrats were projecting, arguing that with judgments that have been stopping the president's executive orders, \"the real Constitutional crisis is taking place within our judicial branch.\"\n\nIn the halls of the Capitol, Democrats' plaintive hopes a few Republican allies might join them in opposing certain Trump moves is quickly curdling into scorn and disgust.\n\n\"My impression is that nothing is more miserable right now than being a Republican member of Congress. They're at Mar-a-Lago over at the White House when he's signing the executive orders. Are they being brought in at all to his plan? They're not at all,\" said Rep. Haley Stevens, a Michigan congresswoman. \"They're neutering their own leadership.\"\n\nCasten said as he walks around on the floor and hears Republican colleagues quietly telling him they agree with some of what he's saying about Trump. He now sees people he suspects are so convinced that they're in end times to feel they \"are never going to have to worry about another democratic election,\" or at least wouldn't object if the situation came to that.\n\n\"How are you feeling?\" he recalled a colleague asked him while they were sitting in the House chamber the other day.\n\n\"I'm feeling,\" Casten said, referring to only his Democratic colleagues, \"like there's only 213 people in this room that I'd trust in a foxhole.\"\n\nKicking off a Congressional Progressive Caucus meeting this week, new chair Texas Rep. Greg Casar read from Franklin Roosevelt's 1936 speech to the Democratic convention, where he spoke about \"clouds of suspicion, tides of ill-will and intolerance gather darkly in many places,\" and said \"privileged princes of these new economic dynasties, thirsting for power, reached out for control over government itself.\"\n\n\"We should be talking about the fact that it is not immigrants that are raising your rent, it is hedge funds that are buying up your neighborhoods and raising your rent. It is not LGBT Americans that are screwing up, you have, your health care, it's corporate CEOs who are,\" Casar said. \"If we don't want to continue in this cycle where we win, then we lose, we win, then we lose, but we keep trending downward, we have to fundamentally transform what the Democratic Party has become in the last 25 years.\"\n\nCasar argued this will start to catch and become the pushback that still hasn't come organically, like eight years ago.\n\n\"Pretty soon everyone's going to be feeling it, and people are going to look back at stories from this last week or two and they're like, that was a kind of awkward time, but it's fine,\" he said.\n\nIn polls and focus groups across an array of internal Democratic groups and allies, described to CNN, centering on talking about prices remains the most prevalent advice - and it's where House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries has kept returning to, flanked by signs at his two most recent weekly press conferences headlined \"HOW IS THIS LOWERING COSTS?\" and \"REPUBLICANS BETRAY THE MIDDLE CLASS.\"\n\nJeffries conceded, when pressed by CNN, that voters hadn't bought this argument from voters last year, but he insisted the difference now is that Republicans haven't delivered.\n\nJeffries, who likes baseball as much as he likes historical statistics, sees an example of Yankees slugger Aaron Judge, who has one of the highest whiff rates in baseball, but also led the league in both walks and home runs. This is a lesson, he says, in not swinging at everything.\n\nJeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer are wrangling behind the scenes about who can keep their own members in line and for what.\n\nBut with Schumer 20 years older, further in the minority now and much less likely to have a realistic shot at getting back to the majority in the 2026 midterms, Democrats' political attention against Trump is zeroing in on the House.\n\nJeffries and his team believe they will have more pressure to exert as the budget talks near, with swing district Republicans in their tiny majority already signaling that they will oppose cuts the leadership is putting forward, in addition to the expected House Freedom Caucus defections.\n\nBut they are also carefully watching how public mood is shifting on the ground in the most closely divided districts, not yet convinced that voters want the kind of resistance to Trump that they or the loudest activists are demanding\n\nShortly before he left the Capitol to spend a week back in his own district and listening to what his members will be hearing in their own, Jeffries paused for a moment when asked what he would say to Democrats who have given up hope.\n\n\"Keep hope alive. The Trump administration is losing in court, not winning. Over and over and over again,\" he said. \"And they have not achieved a single legislative victory. And his approval ratings aren't going up-they're going down.\"\n\nThe challenge for Jeffries and his fellow Democrats as they search for a way forward is the new political reality: Trump has already notched one court win on his plans to reduce the federal workforce, he signed into law a GOP-led bill to require the detention of undocumented migrants charged with certain crimes that drew Democratic support and his poll numbers are as high as they have been in his 10 years in politics.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "House Democrats push to sink GOP spending bill but Senate Dems act coy\n\nFollow:\n\nHakeem Jeffries and House Democrats are ready to seize on the first big leverage point of President Donald Trump's second term, lining up against a bill to avert a government shutdown this week.\n\nBut the party's position is far murkier in the Senate, showcasing stark divisions within the party over how far Democrats are willing to go against Trump.\n\nWhile House Democrats are preparing to vote in lockstep and force Republican Speaker Mike Johnson to put up the votes on his own , they've watched with frustration as Senate Democrats have been much more cautious in their deliberations. And if the House successfully passes it on Tuesday, Senate Democrats are saying little about how they'll handle a take-it-or-leave-it option that could lead to a paralyzing - and politically toxic - shutdown.\n\nRelated article What we know about the House GOP government funding bill\n\n\"It would be a capitulation to the Trump style of democracy, which is the movement of democracy to dictatorship,\" said Rep. Hank Johnson, a typically mild-mannered Democrat from Georgia, when asked what happened if Senate Democrats allowed the spending bill to become law.\n\nEven with Trump and the GOP in charge of Washington, some Senate Democrats privately worry they could be blamed for a funding lapse. But others believe they risk backlash from their base if Democrats are seen as folding in the fight without a single concession from Trump.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer briefed his leadership team on Monday evening, during which New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker said Schumer did not outline an official position but briefed senators on \"the outrageous things\" in the House GOP bill. Schumer has made clear in recent days that he will keep his powder dry until the House vote, with Republicans there still struggling to lock down support.\n\n\"The House CR is a very bad bill,\" Sen. Tim Kaine, who represents a large share of federal workers in Virginia, said when asked if he would support the GOP's stopgap bill, known as a continuing resolution.\n\nKaine was among many Democratic senators on Monday who repeatedly slammed the House GOP bill, though didn't oppose it outright. When asked about the choice Senate Democrats would have to make - either accept the House bill or risk a shutdown - Kaine cut off a reporter's question and then declined to answer: \"I'm not answering 'if' questions. I'm answering 'what do I think of the bill?' It's a bad bill.\"\n\nAnd Georgia Sen. Jon Ossoff, who faces a potentially tough reelection next year, told CNN a shutdown is \"not in our nation's interests\" and \"we will see what comes out of the House.\"\n\nExasperated Democrats on both sides of the Capitol privately feel like they are operating with little clarity of the other's strategy. House Democrats are growing impatient as top Senate Democrats, including Schumer, have yet to lay out their position. It's not just rank and file: Schumer has not briefed Jeffries on his plans, according to a Democratic lawmaker close to Jeffries.\n\nA Schumer spokesperson told CNN that \"Leader Schumer and Leader Jeffries are in constant communication.\"\n\nMany House Democrats said their Senate counterparts need to channel their base's intense anger at the White House for its wide scale federal layoffs, plans to dismantle key agencies and planned cuts to safety net programs - or risk handing Trump even more power while further infuriating their base.\n\n\"Americans across the board are fed up with what Elon Musk and Donald Trump are doing,\" added Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts. \"This is the only leverage that we have. Americans want us to do something.\"\n\nAlready, multiple House Democrats are aiming their frustration at Schumer, who they do not believe is willing to risk a confrontation with Trump over spending, according to multiple lawmakers who were granted anonymity to discuss internal party dynamics.\n\n\"If Chuck Schumer can't get us a better vote, he should resign,\" one centrist House Democrat told CNN, who lamented the party was being too cautious even as Trump trampled over Congress' powers. \"What's the plan? What's the strategy? There isn't one.\"\n\nSenate Republicans would need at least eight Democrats to back the bill, given staunch opposition from GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky. But several battleground Democrats were noncommittal Monday night when asked how they would vote.\n\nOther Democrats, though, were far more critical of the House GOP plan and signaled they would not accept it.\n\n\"I was stunned to read they were trying to jam through something that's 'their way or the highway,'\" Booker said of the GOP's plan. \"They can't get this done without Democratic support.\"\n\nFor now, all attention is on the House, where Johnson and his deputies will attempt to pass the stopgap funding plan with only GOP votes Tuesday afternoon. Three Republicans, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, Rich McCormick of Georgia and Tim Burchett of Tennessee, are currently opposed, which is enough to tank the bill. A handful of other Republicans remained undecided on Monday night, signaling a tough fight ahead though GOP leaders insisted they could lock down the votes.\n\nRelated article Republicans succeed in persuading Musk as Democrats hit dead ends\n\n\"I feel good, I think we'll have the votes,\" Johnson told reporters Monday night, adding that he had spoken with Trump three hours prior.\n\nTrump himself is making calls to potential hold outs ahead of Tuesday's vote, according to multiple people familiar with the outreach. One undecided Republican, Tennessee Rep. Andy Ogles, said he recently got a call from Trump, while Burchett said he got a call from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.\n\nBurchett told CNN that he is seeking an assurance from the president that DOGE will \"go through the Pentagon like they have the other departments, like USAID, because I've got a feeling the fraud there and the abuse and the reckless spending is just over the top, and then I'll make a decision after that.\"\n\nVice President JD Vance will also huddle with House Republicans Tuesday morning ahead of the vote, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nThe ultra conservative House Freedom Caucus also met Monday night to discuss the plan and endorsed the stopgap measure in a statement afterward.\n\nHouse Democrats, meanwhile, plan to present a unified front during Tuesday's vote. Jeffries and his No. 2, Rep. Katherine Clark, told reporters Monday that Democrats would uniformly oppose the bill, after their leadership team spent the weekend phoning members about reasons to oppose it.\n\n\"It is not something we could ever support. House Democrats will not be complicit in the Republican effort to hurt the American people,\" Jeffries told reporters of the spending bill.\n\nEven moderate Blue Dog members do not plan to bail out Johnson on the vote if he can't reach the 217 votes needed on his own, according to a person familiar with the members' thinking. Jeffries will meet with a group of battleground Democrats ahead of the vote, but multiple Democrats planning to attend told CNN that they are already planning to oppose the bill.\n\nRep. Pramila Jayapal, a top House progressive, said it's \"very important\" for Schumer and the party to block the bill in the Senate, as well.\n\n\"This gives them the permission to do all the things that they're doing now with more, with even more ability to slash Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid,\" Jayapal said.\n\nAsked what happens if eight Democrats back the plan in the Senate, Jayapal retorted: \"That's not going to happen.\"\n\nCNN's Annie Grayer, Ted Barret, Samantha Waldenberg, Alison Main contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Democratic Party hits new polling low, while its voters want to fight Trump harder\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nThe Democratic Party has reached an all-time low in popularity in the latest national NBC News poll , as it searches for a path forward after a painful loss to President Donald Trump - and as the party's voters spoil for a fight between their leaders in Washington and Trump.\n\nJust over a quarter of registered voters (27%) say they have positive views of the party, which is the party's lowest positive rating in NBC News polling dating back to 1990. Just 7% say those views are \"very\" positive.\n\n\"With these numbers, the Democratic Party is not in need of a rebrand. It needs to be rebooted,\" said Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates, who conducted the survey along with GOP pollster Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies.\n\nThe slump is partially driven by fed-up Democrats, according to the polling data, after they watched their party lose to Trump in 2024. And now, in a reversal from Trump's first term, self-identified Democratic voters say they want their party to hold the line on their positions even if it leads to gridlock, rather than focus on finding areas of compromise with the president.\n\nThe poll illustrates the angst within the party driving backlash against the Senate Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who sided with Republicans on a Friday procedural vote to advance a GOP -designed spending bill and avert a government shutdown.\n\n\"When Donald Trump wakes up in the morning and says, 'You're doing the right things, Senate Democrats' - we don't feel that is the right place to be,\" Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., the House Democratic Caucus chair, said Friday.\n\nBack in April 2017, 59% of Democrats said they wanted congressional Democrats to make compromises with Trump to gain consensus on legislation, with 33% saying they should stick to their positions even if that means not being able to get things done in Washington.\n\nNow, that sentiment has completely flipped. Almost two-thirds of Democrats, 65%, say they want congressional Democrats to stick to their positions even if that risks sacrificing bipartisan progress, and just 32% want them to make legislative compromises with Trump.\n\nElizabeth Joyce, a 35-year-old technology project manager from Texas, said she may have supported Democrats compromising with Trump during his first term, but not anymore.\n\n\"I'm scared that compromising will lead to the downfall of our democracy, to only be slightly hyperbolic,\" said Joyce, who participated in the survey and said she thought Democrats should hold the line even if it leads to gridlock. \"It's really scary seeing the things being done, the things being slashed left and right without any regard for the outcome.\"\n\n\"I think it's more important for Democrats to stick to their guns and kind of put up a fight,\" said Samantha Kosloske, a 29-year-old from New York. \"I mean, [Trump is] probably not gonna listen either way, but I think that's gonna be at least more effective.\"\n\nEven some of those who want their party to fight say they aren't necessarily looking for sweeping victories so much as for their party to play some defense against Republican efforts they oppose. Democrats are in the minority in both the House and the Senate.\n\n\"I don't expect anything to get done, any productive things to get done during this time, but I would hope they could prevent destructive things from happening, or do what they can to prevent those destructive things from happening,\" said Mary Font, a 46-year-old combat veteran from California.\n\nWhile more Democrats are itching for a fight, some are still looking for the party to make compromises to advance legislation.\n\n\"In order to get some wins we will have to give the conservative party some wins as well,\" said Jason Howard, a 40-year-old data analyst from Florida. He added: \"We're definitely not going to get anything done in the next two years, or at least until this Congress is over, if we don't at least approach them with some give and take.\"\n\nWhen Howard spoke with NBC News on Friday afternoon, he was hoping that Senate Democrats would ultimately vote to keep the government open, arguing that a shutdown could hurt the economy.\n\nOther Democrats said they wanted Democrats to hold the line, even if that meant shutting down the government.\n\nThe survey was conducted from March 7-11, largely before this week's standoff over government funding. But it underscores a dynamic that loomed over that debate, where Democrats in Congress were divided over whether to provide votes to allow passage of a GOP-authored funding bill they hate or block it, which would cause a government shutdown.\n\nDozens of furious Democratic senators tried to draw a line in the sand and argue that the party shouldn't acquiesce to a government funding process after they were cut out of negotiations around it. Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly said the continuing resolution would \"give unchecked power to Donald Trump and Elon Musk,\" with others panning it as \"dangerous\" and \"a terrible deal.\"\n\nUltimately, 10 Senate Democrats including Schumer agreed to end debate on the funding measure, allowing it to pass with Republican votes. Schumer argued that a shutdown would give Trump and Musk's Department of Government Efficiency even more power to dismantle the federal government, but the move angered House Democrats and many Democratic voters who want to see their party hold the line against Trump.\n\nKosloske, the Democrat from New York, name-checked Schumer's decision to advance the funding measure as evidence that Democrats are \"not responding\" to Trump.\n\n\"I'm like, 'OK, so we're just bending over and letting him have everything that he wants,'\" she said.\n\nThere are no clear dividing lines among Democratic voters on this question across gender, socioeconomic status and ethnicity, according to the NBC News poll. Suburban Democratic voters are slightly more likely to want congressional Democrats to dig in when compared to rural Democrats, while white male Democrats and those without college educations are slightly more likely to want compromise.\n\nStill, even those who are open to compromise are looking for more action from congressional Democrats.\n\nHoward, the data analyst from Florida, said he wants Democrats to be \"more vocal\" and more actively pushing out ideas and legislation.\n\n\"They're just willing to protest silently with a little sign or wearing pink to the State of the Union address,\" he said. \"It's not enough.\"\n\nAs Democratic voters are itching for their leaders to fight Trump, the party has reached a new low among the electorate.\n\nA majority of voters (55%) say they have negative views of the party, including 38% who say those views are \"very\" negative.\n\nThe Republican Party also has a net-negative image, with 49% of voters saying they view the party negatively and 39% saying they view it positively. But the GOP can at least console itself with control of the White House and Congress. For Democrats, the numbers are another a warning sign for the party as it tries to regroup and navigate the new Trump administration.\n\nThe drop in the party's image is driven in part by independent voters, with just 11% saying they have positive views while 56% say they have negative views.\n\nThe poll also finds that some components of the Democratic base have soured on the party as well.\n\nNearly 20% of Democratic voters say they have negative views of the party, while 10% of Republicans say the same about the GOP.\n\nAnd a quarter of liberals view the party negatively, double the share of conservatives who view the GOP negatively.\n\nThe new low of positive feelings about the Democratic Party is still a few points higher than the Republican Party's lowest-ever rating, from October 2013, when just 22% said they viewed the party positively amid a government shutdown.\n\nStill, the next year, the GOP scored its biggest House majority in nearly a century after trouncing Democrats in the midterm elections.\n\nNow, the NBC News poll shows a closely divided battle for control of Congress ahead of the 2026 midterms, with 48% of voters saying they preferred a Democratic-controlled Congress and 47% backing Republicans, with 5% saying they are not sure.\n\n\"While this survey shows a mixed result for Donald Trump, Democrats are the ones in the wilderness right now,\" said Horwitt, the Democratic pollster. \"If there is good news, it is on preference for control of Congress, where Democrats have a 1-point advantage.\"\n\nDemocrats also have history on their side next year, with the party in power traditionally losing congressional seats.\n\nVoters did have different views of how congressional Democrats and Republicans have been navigating Trump, with 53% saying Republicans have been too supportive, while 50% say Democrats have been too critical.\n\nA higher share of voters (39%) say Republicans are dealing with Trump in the right way, while 30% say the same of Democrats, but those views are largely driven by voters in those parties.\n\nThe NBC News poll surveyed 1,000 registered voters from March 7-11 via a mix of telephone interviews and an online survey sent via text message. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\n\nBridget Bowman is a national political reporter for NBC News.\n\nBen Kamisar is a national political reporter for NBC News\n\nAlexandra Marquez is a politics reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "The plight of boys and men, once sidelined by Democrats, is now a priority\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nFor Democrats, reaching male voters became a political necessity after last fall's election, when young men swung significantly toward President Donald Trump.\n\nBut for some - like Maryland Gov. Wes Moore - it's also a personal goal. The first-term governor, who has spoken about his own struggles as a teenager, recently announced plans to direct his \"entire administration\" to find ways to help struggling boys and men.\n\n\"The well-being of our young men and boys has not been a societal priority,\" Moore said in an interview. \"I want Maryland to be the one that is aggressive and unapologetic about being able to address it and being able to fix it.\"\n\nMoore's not the only Democrat vowing to help boys and men.\n\nIn her State of the State address, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer shared plans to help boost young men's enrollment in higher education and skills training. And Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont announced what he called \"a DEI initiative, which folks on both sides of the aisle may appreciate,\" to get more men into teaching.\n\nThe announcements come at a critical time. Researchers have argued that the widening gender gap reflects a crisis that, if not addressed, could push men toward extremism . And Democratic pollsters fret that if liberal politicians, in particular, do not address these issues, the party is at risk of losing more men to the GOP.\n\n\"When Trump talks about fixing the economy and being strong, they hear someone who gets it,\" said John Della Volpe, director of polling at Harvard Kennedy School's Institute of Politics, and an adviser to Joe Biden's 2020 presidential campaign. \"That doesn't mean they trust him. But it does mean he's speaking to their reality in a way most Democrats aren't.\"\n\nOn the campaign trail, Kamala Harris often spoke about issues of importance to women, emphasizing reproductive rights, for instance, and paid family leave policies. But soul-searching over her loss has prompted Democrats to reach out more aggressively to men, by engaging more with sports , for instance, and looking for ways to make the party seem less \"uncool\" to young voters.\n\nShauna Daly, a Democratic strategist and co-founder of the Young Men Research Project, said candidates need to do more than show young men that they can hang. \"Where the Democratic Party has really fallen short with this cohort is that they don't feel like Democrats are fighting for them,\" she said.\n\nThey need policies like those the governors have proposed, Daly said, that address men's tangible problems.\n\nIn every state, women earn more college degrees than men. Boys are more likely to be disciplined in class , and less likely to graduate high school on time than girls. Men die by suicide at higher rates than women and are more likely to rely on illicit drugs and alcohol. And while women increasingly participate in the workforce at higher rates, men have steadily dropped out of the labor market.\n\nThe governors' speeches touched on many of these issues, and earned cautious applause from masculinity researchers, who said they reflected a promising shift.\n\n\"I think it's part of a growing recognition among Democrats that neglecting the problems of boys and men is neither good policy nor good politics,\" said Richard Reeves, founder of the American Institute for Boys and Men, who has informally advised Moore's staff. \"If Democrats weren't thinking about male voters, and especially young male voters, then it would be a pretty serious dereliction of duty, looking at the polls.\"\n\nIn the past, Democrats might have been wary of targeting programs toward boys and men for fear of excluding girls. Whitmer seemed aware of this dynamic in her speech, when she followed her announcement about young men with a shoutout to women and a vow not to abandon her \"commitment to equal opportunity and dignity for everyone.\"\n\nA handful of other states, including some run by Republican governors, have already launched initiatives targeting men in recent years. Utah established a task force that aims to help \"men and boys lead flourishing lives,\" and North Dakota created the position of a men's health coordinator to study and raise awareness of disparities affecting men.\n\nMoore said he was partly inspired by his own experience growing up in the Bronx after his father passed. He has described how troubles in his youth - including a brush with the police for vandalism, skipping school and getting poor grades - led his mother to send him away to military school, which he credits with helping him straighten up.\n\n\"It is very personal for me, because I was one of those young men and boys that we're trying to reach,\" he said. \"And I felt like so many of the conversations that were being had about me were not being had with me.\"\n\nMoore will hold a cabinet meeting in April to discuss plans for the state agencies, but he has some initial goals: to encourage more men in his state to pursue jobs in education and health care, help boys within the juvenile justice system, and make sure he solicits input from boys and men on how the initiatives are designed.\n\nFor Della Volpe, from the Harvard Kennedy School, the governors' announcements are encouraging. \"The truth is, young men are speaking,\" he said. \"They've been telling us they want respect, opportunity, and strength. If Democrats don't listen - and act - they'll keep losing ground. But this moment offers hope.\"\n\nTyler Kingkade is a national reporter for NBC News, based in Los Angeles.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "Wisconsin provides a critical test for Democrats' anti-Elon Musk playbook\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nNext week's Wisconsin Supreme Court race is emerging as the first big test of Democrats' anti- Elon Musk strategy as the party searches for a winning message following its loss to President Donald Trump last November.\n\nTrump's billionaire adviser has been a major player in the technically nonpartisan judicial race. Musk's super PAC has emerged as the top spender in the contest, offered $100 to Wisconsin voters to sign a petition to oppose \"activist judges\" and said it would give away $1 million to a petition signer . And Musk often posts about the election on his X feed.\n\nBetween that and his polarizing efforts through the Department of Government Efficiency to slash the size of the federal government - and polling that shows he's less popular than Trump, who endorsed conservative candidate Brad Schimel last week - Democratic-aligned groups and liberal candidate Susan Crawford have made Musk a major focal point in the race's final stretch.\n\nIt's a playbook that Democrats could seek to replicate elsewhere if it's successful in one of the country's tightest battleground states.\n\n\"Democrats can't win against Trump right now,\" Brandon Scholz, a Wisconsin Republican strategist, said. \"They can still beat the hell out of Musk.\"\n\nScholz argued that Democrats would risk juicing conservative turnout in the off-year election by attempting to make Trump, who narrowly carried Wisconsin on his way to winning a second term in the White House, the center of their strategy.\n\n\"I don't think the Democrats want to draw [Schimel] to Trump, because that gives MAGA voters incentive to come out to vote,\" Scholz added.\n\nTuesday's race will determine the state Supreme Court's ideological balance for the second time in two years - and likely along with it the future of several key issues, including abortion rights, unions and congressional maps. Crawford is a state judge in Madison who earlier worked in the Democratic administration of then-Gov. Jim Doyle, while Schimel, a state judge in Waukesha County, previously was the state's Republican attorney general.\n\nCrawford and groups supporting her have criticized Musk's money and influence on the race on the airwaves.\n\nOne television ad from the Crawford campaign, which began running on cable and broadcast in the state Tuesday, features a former assistant district attorney from Madison claiming that Musk \"is trying to buy this election with ads that lie about Judge Susan Crawford.\" Another recent Crawford campaign TV ad accused Musk of \"trying to buy Schimel a seat on the Supreme Court because he knows Schimel always helps his big campaign donors.\"\n\nCrawford has repeatedly used Musk as a foil at campaign events , and she attributed her latest fundraising haul to grassroots donations \"from folks who don't want Elon Musk controlling our Supreme Court.\"\n\n\"Voters are very animated by Musk,\" Crawford campaign spokesperson Derrick Honeyman said in an interview. \"That's why you see us mentioning Musk in the campaign.\" Honeyman added the Crawford campaign wasn't planning to run any ads in the race's remaining days directly mentioning Trump.\n\nThe Democratic Party of Wisconsin has also been hosting a town-hall tour across the state called \"People v. Musk,\" with surrogates like Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz using the events as platforms to further bash Musk and DOGE.\n\nAt one such event earlier this month in Eau Claire, Walz said Wisconsinites could use their Supreme Court race ballots to convey their disapproval of Musk's work in the federal government.\n\n\"This is where you send a message,\" he said, adding that a Crawford win would mark a rebuke to Musk and represent \"cleaning the house - one chunk at a time.\"\n\n\"And America's first chunk of cleaning is Wisconsin's Supreme Court, April 1,\" he said.\n\nResponding to questions about the left's attempts to tie Schimel to Musk and about whether Schimel was seeking to link himself to Trump, Schimel campaign spokesperson Jacob Fischer said in an email that \"the attempts by Susan Crawford and the Democrats to distract the people of Wisconsin from her extreme views and the radical billionaires funding her are a mockery of hypocrisy.\"\n\nA representative for Musk and a White House spokesperson who handles inquiries regarding Musk and DOGE didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nRecent polling in Wisconsin and nationally suggests that DOGE's tactics are pushing voters' patience and that Musk has emerged as a riper political target than Trump for Democrats.\n\nPolling released this month from Marquette University Law School found that more registered voters in Wisconsin (53%) viewed Musk unfavorably than favorably (41%). By contrast, the survey showed that voters in the swing state were more split on Trump's job performance (48% said they approved; 51% said they disapproved) and on whether Musk's DOGE was properly carrying out Trump's agenda (47% said it was; 53% said it wasn't).\n\nA national NBC News poll released this month offered similar findings: More voters (51%) viewed Musk negatively than positively (39%) and more held negative views on DOGE (47%) than positive (41%). Meanwhile, Trump's job approval rating was split , with 47% approving and 51% disapproving.\n\nMusk endorsed Schimel on X in January days after his electric car company, Tesla, filed a suit in Wisconsin challenging a state law banning carmakers from owning dealerships. The case could end up before the state Supreme Court.\n\nThe race is the most expensive state Supreme Court campaign in U.S. history - surpassing a record set in Wisconsin in 2023 - and there's already been more than $74 million in spending by the candidates and outside groups.\n\nMusk's America PAC is the top outside spender in the race at $12 million so far - including more than $5 million since just March 18 - focused largely on canvassing and get-out-the-vote efforts.\n\nA GOP-aligned nonprofit group with past ties to Musk, Building America's Future, is the third-biggest outside spender in the race - the ad-tracking firm AdImpact reports the group has spent more than $6.5 million on ads there so far. While Reuters and The Wall Street Journal have both reported that Musk helped to fund the group in the past, it's not clear whether he's still involved.\n\nA spokesperson who handles questions for America PAC and Building America's Future didn't respond to questions.\n\nAnd Musk himself appears to have donated $3 million to the Wisconsin Republican Party across two donations in February and March. (While Musk hasn't personally confirmed the donations, the filings list his name and an address previously associated with his donations to America PAC.)\n\nBut overall, Democrats hold a slight ad spending edge in the race, according to AdImpact, outpacing Republican-aligned groups $31.1 million to $26.4 million through Wednesday.\n\nThe vast majority of ad spending from the pro-Crawford side comes from her campaign, while outside groups account for the bulk of the pro-Schimel ad spending. And overall, Crawford's campaign reported spending more than $21 million through March 17, compared with $9.5 million for Schimel's campaign.\n\nAside from the high levels of spending, there's also been a surge in early voting in the race, which kicked off last week. In-person absentee voting has already exceeded total levels during Wisconsin's 2023 spring elections, while total absentee voting is on pace to push past 2023 levels in the coming days.\n\nEven if he hasn't been front and center, Trump, who posted on Truth Social last Friday urging Wisconsin voters to turn out early for Schimel, has still been a presence on the campaign trail in Wisconsin.\n\nSchimel's campaign launched a TV ad that went on the air Wednesday touting the endorsement. Mailers paid for and placed by America PAC, for example, tout Schimel as the candidate who will \"support President Trump's agenda.\"\n\nAnd two 30-second ads, funded by the Republican State Leadership Committee, which boosts GOP candidates in nonfederal statewide races, launched Friday just hours before the president's endorsement. Both emphasize how voters in Wisconsin just months ago delivered the state for Trump - and how a Crawford win could jeopardize his accomplishments.\n\n\"Last year we showed up for Trump and he won,\" a narrator says in one of the ads . \"President Trump needs us again.\"\n\nBut groups on the left have yet to run ads trying to weaponize the endorsement, according to an NBC News analysis of AdImpact data.\n\nMeanwhile, Schimel's views on Trump have long been in plain view. He appeared at a campaign town hall event this month with Donald Trump Jr. and recently told a group of canvassers from the conservative group Turning Point USA that Trump needs a \"support network\" around him to help him fight the myriad suits his administration has faced. Schimel has also supported Trump's unfounded claims of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election.\n\n\"Schimel needs Trump to win. He needs every MAGA voter to turn out to win,\" Scholz, the GOP strategist, said. \"He wants to draw close to Trump.\"\n\nCORRECTION (March 31, 2025, 11:31 a.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated the amount of total spending in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race. It is more than $74 million altogether, not $86 million by outside groups alone.\n\nAdam Edelman is a politics reporter for NBC News.\n\nBen Kamisar is a national political reporter for NBC News\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

The anger has intensified since Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., led a group of Democrats to help advance a Republican government funding bill backed by Trump to avert a government shutdown, prompting questions about whether party leaders are up to the task.\n\nSeveral Democratic lawmakers also distanced themselves from Schumer, dumping further criticism on his strategy during the funding fight.\n\nAt a town hall Wednesday evening just outside Denver, Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., found himself on the receiving end of anger and criticism from voters for being too passive when it comes to battling Trump.\n\nOne attendee tore into Bennet for voting to confirm several of Trump's Cabinet nominees, including Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy.\n\n\"None of this feels like you're fighting for us, for Colorado, for our kids, for our grandkids,\" an attendee told Bennet as the crowd cheered. \"The words are great, but I'm really not seeing any action.\"\n\nToward the beginning of the event - which Bennet held in Golden, alongside Rep. Brittany Pettersen, D-Colo. - attendees shouted for one full minute as Bennet attempted to calm the crowd.\n\n\"Hey. Hey! We're not going to do it this way,\" Bennet yelled, before repeatedly shouting, \"Stop it!\"\n\nBennet was also pressed on whether Schumer should remain Senate Democratic leader. He referenced his call for then-President Joe Biden to step aside during the 2024 campaign.\n\n\"In dodging your question, let me just say it's important for people to know, you know, when it's time to go,\" Bennet said. \"And I think in the case of Joe Biden, and we're going to have future conversations about all the Democratic leadership.\n\nOn Tuesday, Rep. Glenn Ivey, D-Md., was also grilled on how Democrats would confront Trump and Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.\n\n\"We need to say 'hell no,'\" one attendee told the genteel Ivey at a town hall he hosted this week in Suitland, a suburb outside of Washington. \"And thank you for being polite with us, but when it comes to fighting these fights, we need you to be a little bit less polite, a little bit more hell no, instead of a little bit no.\"\n\nIn a separate exchange, another attendee repeatedly interrupted the two-term congressman as he tried to answer someone else's question: \"The House is on fire. It is not business as usual. ... This is outrageous. ... This is bulls---.\"\n\nBut Ivey drew loud applause when he became the first Democratic member of Congress to call for Schumer to step down from his post as party leader.\n\n\"I respect Chuck Schumer. I think he's had a great, longstanding career. He's done a lot of great things, but I'm afraid that it may be time for the Senate Democrats to pick new leadership as we move forward,\" Ivey said.\n\nIn Arizona on Monday, Democratic Sens. Mark Kelly and Ruben Gallego appeared before a less hostile crowd, but faced pointed questions from attendees about how they would protect programs they rely on. Kelly encouraged them to make phone calls and go to the offices of Republican members of Congress.\n\n\"You show up in front of their office, tell them how pissed off you are and how bad this is for our country and how there are people inside the house that you were trying to burn down,\" Kelly said.\n\nThe town hall events underscored the increased pressure Democratic members of Congress are under from their base to use every tool possible to block Trump's agenda, even as they are limited in their role as the minority party in Washington. The scenes mirror the events of 2009, which were directed simultaneously at the Democratic governing trifecta in Washington and at members of the Republican minority who were accused of being too passive in opposition.\n\nA recent NBC News poll found that 65% of Democrats want their elected representatives to stick to their positions and hold the line against Trump, while 32% favor compromising with him. That's a dramatic shift from Trump's first term: An April 2017 NBC News poll found that 59% of Democrats favored compromising with Trump, while 33% said lawmakers should stick to their positions.\n\nThat's also led some progressive activists to call for new leadership in Congress. It's a matter several Democrats declined to directly address this week while offering criticism of Schumer.\n\nAt a town hall in Lowell, Massachusetts, this week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said Schumer's decision to allow the GOP funding bill to move through the Senate was \"wrong,\" but didn't say whether he should remain the party's leader.\n\nSen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., dodged a question on Schumer's future at a news conference in San Francisco, saying he doesn't \"opine on internal caucus politics.\"\n\n\"We're going to have to do a lot better the next time a key issue like this comes up,\" Schiff said.\n\nFor his part, Schumer canceled a planned book tour this week amid the backlash, citing security concerns. But he has continued to defend his funding strategy in TV interviews, saying that a government shutdown would have resulted in a worse outcome for federal workers and further empower Trump and Musk. And he's brushed off calls to step down from his leadership position.\n\n\"I'm the best leader for the Senate,\" he said Tuesday on CBS Mornings.\"\n\nMeanwhile, few Republican lawmakers held town halls this week during the congressional recess after drawing angry and frustrated crowds of their own earlier this year. Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., the chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee, advised members against holding in-person town halls.\n\nOne who did though, Rep. Harriet Hageman, R-Wyo., faced heckles and boos Wednesday night in Laramie, Wyoming, as she tried to downplay concerns about Trump and Musk.\n\n\"It's so bizarre to me how obsessed you are with federal government,\" Hageman said, adding that the attendees' \"hysteria is just really over the top.\"\n\nAnd not every Democrat who has held a town hall in recent days received an icy reception.\n\nAt a Wednesday town hall in Frederick, Maryland, Democratic Reps. April McClain Delaney and Jamie Raskin faced a largely friendly, energized crowd that cheered lines about protecting Medicaid and Social Security and stopping DOGE in the courts, as well as hints of impeaching Trump if Democrats retake the House in 2026. (Raskin is the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee and any impeachment push would start in his committee.)\n\nStill, several constituents told NBC News they were frustrated by a lack of \"substance\" at the town hall.\n\nJuliana Lufkin, 33, a self-employed resident of Hagerstown, said the lawmakers were \"tooting their own horns\" when she would've liked to hear a strategy for combating Trump.\n\n\"I would've liked to hear the plan, instead of a little bit of tooting their own horns and saying the things they're doing and the things that we can do. This is not the leadership that we all hope for,\" Lufkin said.\n\nSahil Kapur is a senior national political reporter for NBC News.\n\nScott Wong is a senior congressional reporter for NBC News.\n\nBrennan Leach is a Desk Assistant for NBC News.\n\nSyedah Asghar is a Capitol Hill researcher for NBC News and is based in Washington, D.C.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

But he maintains that while the GOP's six-month bill was \"certainly bad,\" a shutdown \"would be 15 or 20 times worse.\"\n\n\"Under a shutdown, the executive branch has sole power to determine what is 'essential.' And they can determine without any court supervision. The courts have ruled it's solely up to the executive what to shut down,\" he said, warning that the Trump administration \"would eviscerate the federal government.\"\n\n\"On Day 2, they could say, 'Oh, SNAP? Feeding hungry children? Not essential.' On Day 4, 'Mass transit? All transit? Aid to the states? Not essential. We're cutting it.' On Day 6, 'Medicaid? We'll cut that by 20%, 30%, 50%, 80%. We'll go after Social Security. We'll go after the veterans.' Their goal is to just eviscerate the federal government so they can give more taxes, and their tax cuts ... to their billionaire class over there,\" he said.\n\n\"Sometimes when you're a leader, you have to do things to avoid a real danger that might come down the curve. And I did it out of pure conviction as to what a leader should do and what the right thing for America and my party was. People disagree.\"\n\nIt's up to Democratic senators to choose their leader, and none of them have called on Schumer to quit a post that he has held for more than eight years. But some have entertained questions about whether it's time for a re-examination. Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., told a constituent at a town hall last week that \"we're going to have future conversations about all the Democratic leadership.\"\n\nSchumer also rejected comparisons to then-President Joe Biden's refusal to step down as the 2024 nominee, in response to a question about whether he's making the same mistake.\n\n\"No, absolutely not. I did this out of conviction. And, look, in my caucus, we have a disagreement as to, you know, some people voted one way, some people voted the other. But we've all agreed to respect each other because each side saw why the other side felt so strongly about it. And our caucus is united in fighting Donald Trump every step of the way,\" Schumer said.\n\nNBC N e ws has re ported that some Democrats hope progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., launches a primary bid against Schumer in 2028 if he decides to seek re-election.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., said in an interview Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union\" that the decision was Ocasio-Cortez's to make, adding, \"There were a lot of people at the Democratic retreat who had encouraged her, and I was just in New York, and I was surprised how much support there is.\"\n\n\"The American people are fed up with the old guard. There needs to be a renewal. In Silicon Valley, when a company isn't doing well, you don't keep the same team,\" Khanna added.\n\nSchumer responded Sunday to a suggestion from Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the former House speaker, that the Senate Democrats who voted to break a filibuster gave their votes without getting anything. \"What we got, at the end of the day, is avoiding the horror of a shutdown,\" Schumer said.\n\nSchumer said President Donald Trump has put the U.S. in a constitutional crisis as he escalates attacks on the judiciary and faces allegations from judges that he defied court orders.\n\n\"Look, this is an extraordinary moment. It does require extraordinary action. If he defies the Supreme Court, then we are in uncharted territory that we haven't been in for a very long time, and our entire democracy, this whole beautiful enterprise of democracy that we've had for over 240 years, is at risk. And look, I believe that if Donald Trump should defy the courts, the public will rise up,\" he said. \"Democrats will fight it in every single way.\"\n\nSchumer also discussed his new book, \"Antisemitism in America: A Warning,\" saying he wrote it because he's concerned that antisemitism is on the rise again.\n\n\"I aimed it at both the hard right, and we've seen how viciously antisemitic they could be, but also at the hard left. I felt, as a progressive, I could talk to them about how some of their anti-Israel activity - I might disagree with it, but they're certainly entitled to do it, and it is not antisemitic - has been sliding over into direct antisemitism,\" Schumer said. \"I would like all of America to read this. So I hope it will be reading in colleges and in high schools to learn, teach people the history. ... I believe the best antidote to antisemitism is education.\"\n\nSchumer, who is the highest-ranking Jewish elected official in the United States, said it's \"possible\" there will be a Jewish president in his lifetime, because \"glass ceilings are broken every day.\"\n\nSahil Kapur is a senior national political reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., within the party in some way, according to interviews with a dozen Democratic lawmakers, aides and strategists.\n\nAs Ryan Nobles, Melanie Zanona and Jonathan Allen report , some of the initial skepticism among Democrats about the progressive star when she first arrived in Washington six years ago has started to fade as she has established herself as a political player on Capitol Hill and demonstrated a unique knack for communicating with a younger generation.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif, publicly urged Ocasio-Cortez to launch a Senate primary challenge against Schumer in 2028 if he runs for re-election, and several House Democrats told NBC News that her colleagues also privately pushed her to do so at a party retreat last week.\n\nStarting Thursday, she is taking her message on the road with a fellow progressive heavyweight, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. The pair will hold a series of rallies in swing districts and on college campuses in Arizona, Nevada and Colorado that are expected to draw massive crowds, sparking inevitable questions about her considering a run for higher office - perhaps even president.\n\nAs for the Republicans: Meanwhile, few GOP lawmakers held town halls this week during the congressional recess after they drew angry and frustrated crowds of their own earlier this year. Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., the chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee, advised members against holding in-person town halls.\n\nOne who did, though, Rep.

They need to sharpen their knives. They need to excite the base. They need to be able to stand up against what is happening in Washington, D.C.\"\n\nFried said that the energy from campaign events would siphon media attention from President Donald Trump and that she wouldn't be opposed to the party's picking its nominee early and all at once.\n\n\"Why not just run and vote in November '26?\" she said. \"Forget all of this 'Iowa has to go first' or North Carolina or South Carolina. F--- all that. Let's go!\"\n\nFried isn't alone in feeling added urgency in the early months of Trump's term, according to several Democratic officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss party strategy. Nor, these officials said, is she the only one who wants to hold primaries and caucuses before the traditional start at the beginning of the election year.\n\nBut it's too early to begin making decisions about the calendar, three of the officials said. So early, one Democratic National Committee adviser said, that it's \"not generally on the radar of the leadership of the DNC\" yet. And even if the party wanted to change its primary dates, state laws could prevent official contests from taking place before 2028.\n\nAt the same time, new DNC Chair Ken Martin wants to bring back a form of Democrats' long-abandoned midterm convention in 2026, the DNC adviser said. The party wouldn't pick its nominee at that time, but it would hold a high-profile conference.\n\nIn small ways, the shadow primary has already begun, with prominent Democrats holding campaign-style rallies, using their elected offices to oppose Trump and, in the case of California Gov. Gavin Newsom, hosting a politics-focused podcast.\n\n\"Everybody's playing this tiptoeing game. [People] know you're all running - just go,\" Fried said. \"The base wants to know who is our next leader, when can we get out of this funk and start moving on to the next chapter.\"\n\nThat's all From the Politics Desk for now.

But prior to final passage, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and nine other Democrats helped the measure clear a 60-vote procedural hurdle in the GOP-controlled chamber.\n\nIt was that decision that has stoked deep divisions with the Democratic Party, which is facing a reckoning over how to respond to Trump.\n\nTensions boiled over after Schumer first announced on Thursday he would vote in favor of advancing the GOP spending bill, despite Democratic fears that the measure passed by the House would enable Trump and Elon Musk to further lay off government workers and seek to eliminate programs without congressional input.\n\nBut Schumer took to the Senate floor again this morning and argued that shutting down the government would only embolden Trump and Musk.\n\n\"Musk has told everybody he wants a shutdown because he knows it will help him achieve his horrible goal of just decimating the federal government from one end to the other,\" Schumer said. \"In other words, if government were to shut down, DOGE has a plan in place to exploit the crisis for maximum destruction.\"\n\nTrump praised Schumer on Truth Social, calling his announcement a \"really good and smart move\" that took \"guts and courage.\" House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar of California responded to the president's post: \"When Donald Trump wakes up in the morning and says, 'You're doing the right things Senate Democrats,' we don't feel that is the right place to be.\"\n\nThe reaction from Democrats has been furious. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., a leading progressive opposed to the bill, called Schumer's move \"devastating\" and a \"slap in the face.\"\n\nIn a stunning move, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a statement calling on Democratic senators to reject the bill, defying Schumer. And House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., declined in a press conference to answer whether it's time for new leadership in the Senate.\n\nI've been speaking to a number of Democratic sources, and while some were relieved by Schumer's move, one congressional aide told me to expect \"severe\" blowback from the base. The aide also noted the divide seems to be falling largely along generational lines, with some of the newest voices in the Senate being some of the staunchest opponents to Schumer's strategy.\n\nWhy the backlash? Well, one, a number of vulnerable House Democrats in Trump districts opposed the bill earlier this week, and now feel like they took a tough vote for no reason. Second, some Democrats feel as though keeping the government open is basically giving Trump and Musk a green light to move forward with their deep cuts. And third, perhaps most importantly, many in the party saw this fight as the best opportunity to register their opposition to Trump. The question is: If not now, when?\n\nThe episode has been a real test of Schumer's leadership at a critical moment when Democrats are still trying to find their footing. And it all underscores that there is a deep divide in the party about the best way to take on Trump in the opening months of his second administration.\n\nWe'll get our first real sense of how voters are reacting to all of the moves out of Washington in our new NBC News poll, which Steve Kornacki will debut on \"Meet the Press\" this Sunday. Plus, I'll talk to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn.\n\nFollow live updates →\n\nPresident Donald Trump's choice of Pam Bondi to be attorney general initially prompted sighs of relief in some Democratic and legal circles.\n\nTrump's first pick, then-Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who had been investigated by the Justice Department in connection with allegations of sex trafficking - he denied the allegations and the DOJ decided not to bring charges - was seen as someone chosen because he would do whatever Trump asked, regardless of the ethics or law.\n\nBondi was seen as a professional with deep legal experience: She had served as Florida's attorney general for 10 years. It was true that she had served as one of Trump's lawyers during his first impeachment trial and supported his conspiracy theories about the 2020 election. Still, Democrats and Republicans who knew her believed she was someone who'd stand up to Trump in a way Gaetz wouldn't and refuse if the president asked her to do anything illegal or improper.\n\nBut since Bondi took the reins, the Justice Department has been operating in a manner dramatically at odds with how it has been run in the 50 years since Attorney General John Mitchell was sent to prison for his role in the Watergate scandal.\n\nVowing to end the politicization she says occurred during the Biden administration, Bondi has implemented her own regime of politicization, critics say. The Trump administration, with Bondi's help, appears to be seeking to transform the Justice Department into a political instrument of the president - something that no Republican or Democratic administration has done since Richard Nixon.\n\nRead more from Ken →\n\nRelated: Trump calls for jailing his perceived opponents in Justice Department speech , by Nnamdi Egwuonwu and Ryan J.

      "text": "Democratic anger over 'Schumer surrender' shows party's deep divisions on how to take on Trump\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nWASHINGTON - Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer faces a moment of turmoil after retreating from his initial threat to block a six-month government funding bill written by Republicans, a move that infuriated fellow Democrats in the House and liberal advocates - and raised questions about his effectiveness as party leader.\n\nSchumer, who has served as the Democrats' leader in the Senate for eight years, has typically managed to find consensus within his party. But he now finds himself on the defensive in one of the first major legislative fights of the second Trump administration, even drawing rebukes from longtime allies.\n\nIn an extraordinary move, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, of California, called on Senate Democrats to defy him and reject the GOP bill, while continuing to push for a shorter-term bill, known as a continuing resolution, or CR, to keep the government funded ahead of a midnight deadline.\n\n\"Democratic senators should listen to the women,\" Pelosi said in a statement. \"Appropriations leaders Rosa DeLauro and Patty Murray have eloquently presented the case that we must have a better choice: a four-week funding extension to keep [the] government open and negotiate a bipartisan agreement. America has experienced a Trump shutdown before - but this damaging legislation only makes matters worse.\"\n\nHouse Democratic leaders returned to Washington on Friday from a retreat in Leesburg, Virginia, to urge their Senate colleagues to vote against the funding bill. Asked if it was time for new leadership in the Senate, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Schumer's fellow New York Democrat, responded: \"Next question.\"\n\nHighlighting the party's identity crisis, liberals erupted with anger after Schumer announced Thursday he would vote to advance the GOP bill, with the co-founder of the activist group Indivisible, Ezra Levin, labeling it the \"Schumer surrender\" and urging Democratic senators to defy him.\n\n\"He unilaterally relinquished the biggest point of leverage he has this year. If your strategic analysis ends with you voting for the bill that Mike Johnson, John Thune, Donald Trump and Elon Musk want, you should rethink your strategy,\" Levin told NBC News. \"It's a strategic blunder and tragic mistake. But currently it's his blunder - I hope he's alone out there on that ledge. No Democratic senator should follow him.\"\n\nTen Democrats voted to advance the bill Friday , securing a 62-38 vote that put it on a glide path to passage. Some were on his leadership team, like Sens. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii. Others have announced their retirements, meaning they won't have to face potential voter anger at the ballot box, like Sens. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., and Gary Peters, D-Mich.\n\nSchumer ultimately voted against the funding bill on final passage.\n\nMany moderate Democrats were also befuddled by the strategy - or lack thereof, as they saw it - from Schumer. They wondered why Schumer threatened to reject the Republicans' funding bill only to argue that a shutdown was the worst option and would play into President Donald Trump's hands some 24 hours later. And one House leader noted Trump praised Schumer's move in a Truth Social post Friday morning.\n\n\"When Donald Trump wakes up in the morning and says, 'You're doing the right things, Senate Democrats' - we don't feel that is the right place to be,\" said Rep. Pete Aguilar, of California, the No. 3 House Democrat.\n\n\"I think the blowback from the base will be severe,\" added one Democratic congressional aide, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly.\n\nSen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., who won his race last year in a state Trump carried, told NBC News on Friday that Democrats will \"have to do, as a caucus, a postmortem to see how we got to this point and see if we could improve the situation going into the future.\"\n\nPressed specifically about the way Schumer handled the government funding fight this week, Gallego - who reiterated Friday he hopes the bill fails - said that first \"we're going to deal with today's business at hand.\"\n\n\"For what happened during the CR - I think we should do a retrospective,\" Gallego said, adding that his \"concern\" with allowing the GOP funding bill to go forward is that Democrats will lose their leverage moving forward.\n\nSen. John Fetterman, of Pennsylvania, the first Democrat to publicly back the six-month funding bill, said he hasn't spoken to Schumer or attended the Senate Democratic lunches discussing it.\n\n\"You don't start wars unless you have an exit plan. We had no exit plan,\" Fetterman said, warning that a shutdown would give Republicans the \"absolute ability to decide, on their terms, how to reopen it after we shut it down, just to respond to our highly agitated left part of our party.\"\n\nSen. Patty Murray, of Washington, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, would not say if Democrats need to discuss a leadership change, saying, \"I am focused on doing what I believe is right for my constituents, for our caucus and for our country, and I am a firm no.\"\n\nAsked if senators are urging her to run to replace Schumer, Murray said, \"No, I am doing my job today the right way I believe I should.\"\n\nThe nonendorsement of Schumer's leadership is notable from Murray, who is a Schumer ally. She advocated for a 30-day bill at status quo spending levels to give both parties time to hammer out a larger funding deal and communicated to Democrats behind closed doors for weeks about the dangers of the House GOP plan.\n\nIn a rare move, House Democratic leadership responded to Schumer's floor speech Thursday with a rebuke.\n\n\"House Democrats will not be complicit. We remain strongly opposed to the partisan spending bill under consideration in the Senate,\" Jeffries and his top two deputies said in a joint statement.\n\nSchumer, who is also known for his sharp elbows, defended his decision.\n\n\"If we go into a shutdown - and I told my caucus this - there's no off-ramp. The total off-ramp of a shutdown, how you stop a shutdown, is totally determined by the Republican House and Senate,\" Schumer told reporters. \"They've shown complete blind obeisance by Trump, DOGE, et cetera. They could keep us in a shutdown for months and months and months.\"\n\nSen. John Hickenlooper, D-Colo., who is voting against the House-passed bill and is up for re-election next year, said Schumer finds himself in a \"difficult spot.\"\n\n\"These are two horrible options. ... He did what was right. That's what a leader does,\" Hickenlooper told reporters on Friday. \"If you shut down government - I mean, basically, that's what Trump had been begging to do. That's what he wants. That's his ultimate goal, is to shut down as much government as he can. So I think Sen. Schumer is worried about playing right into his hands.\"\n\nAs Schumer remained quiet about the House measure this week, members of the Democratic base were urging lawmakers to sink the bill at town halls, through phone calls and on social media. Many saw it as an opportunity to stand up to Trump and Elon Musk after they spent weeks laying off federal workers and dismantling federal agencies.\n\nMany Democrats were clinging to a fallback position that featured the 30-day stopgap bill to negotiate a full funding deal. But House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., made clear he was not interested in negotiating spending bills for this fiscal year, having cut off discussions between the top appropriators the previous week. Trump had told Republicans to dispense with government funding talks so they could move on to his big party-line bill to tackle immigration, taxes and other priorities.\n\nAfter Johnson released the six-month government funding bill on Saturday, House Democratic leaders notified Schumer of their strategy: unify against it, hold the line and force Republicans back to the negotiating table, according to two sources familiar with the process.\n\nOne of the sources said they communicated it to Schumer on Saturday. But they needed Senate Democrats to use the 60-vote threshold in the chamber to make it work. And House Democratic leaders were shocked when Schumer declared Thursday that he wouldn't block the Republican bill.\n\n\"The House Dem plan was communicated to Sen Schumer's team,\" a House Democratic lawmaker, who requested anonymity to speak candidly, said by text. \"Yes, we are all surprised by Schumer's acceptance of the GOP CR.\"\n\nMany Democrats doubted that Johnson could pass the bill and were caught flat-footed Tuesday when he muscled it through the House  on a mostly party-line basis.\n\nSchumer didn't initiate a full caucus conversation about how to handle the House measure until Democrats met for lunch on Tuesday, according to a source with knowledge of the internal caucus dynamics.\n\nA spokesperson for Schumer didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe result was a discombobulated strategy that zig-zagged over the course of three days - sidestepping the issue on Tuesday, vowing to block the bill on Wednesday, then a retreat on Thursday.\n\n\"I think there is a deep sense of outrage and betrayal,\" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., told reporters. \"And this is not just about progressive Democrats. This is across the board. The entire party.\"\n\nHours after his turnaround, Schumer said he expected pushback.\n\n\"I knew I'd get criticized,\" Schumer said Thursday night on MSNBC. \"But I felt obligated for the country, for my Democratic caucus, to the people.\"\n\nJulie Tsirkin is a correspondent covering Capitol Hill.\n\nSahil Kapur is a senior national political reporter for NBC News.\n\nFrank Thorp V is a producer and off-air reporter covering Congress for NBC News, managing coverage of the Senate.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "Democrats are desperately searching for new leaders. AOC is stepping into the void.\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is stepping into the Democrats' leadership void, picking up her powerful megaphone to channel the base's anger - toward both President Donald Trump and her own party.\n\nSome of the initial skepticism in the party around the progressive star when she first arrived in Washington six years ago has started to fade as she has established herself as a political player on Capitol Hill and demonstrated a unique knack for communicating with a younger generation.\n\nAs Democrats scramble to find an authentic and effective messenger for the second Trump administration, there is a growing desire to elevate Ocasio-Cortez, 35, within the party in some way, according to interviews with a dozen Democratic lawmakers, aides and strategists - especially after last week's government spending showdown left the base enraged.\n\nOcasio-Cortez was one of the most outspoken Democrats in torching Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., for allowing a Republican funding bill to advance in the Senate to avoid a shutdown. Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif, publicly urged Ocasio-Cortez to launch a primary challenge against Schumer in 2028 if he runs for re-election, and several House Democrats told NBC News that her colleagues also privately pushed her to do so at a party retreat last week.\n\nStarting Thursday, she is set to take her message on the road with a fellow progressive heavyweight, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who has also been critical of current Democratic leadership. The pair will hold a series of rallies in swing districts and on college campuses in Arizona, Nevada and Colorado that are expected to draw massive crowds, sparking inevitable questions about her considering a run for higher office - perhaps even president in 2028.\n\n\"She would walk into any event in America and draw a significant crowd,\" said Faiz Shakir, a political adviser to Sanders. \"Whether they like her or not it doesn't even matter. There are people interested in what she has to say.\"\n\nSome of her Democratic colleagues once viewed Ocasio-Cortez as an attention seeker who was more interested in social media stardom than substantive policy. Others believed she fell into the job only accidentally after her upset primary win at age 28 and were skeptical she would be around for long.\n\nBut now Democrats across the ideological spectrum are starting to recognize that Ocasio-Cortez can grab the spotlight in a way that few others in the party can.\n\n\"She's got boundless promise as the party leader in our country. But the question is who will have the language to express to America where we need to go,\" said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md. \"That's a tall order for anybody, but I would say she's definitely a contender. I don't know that anybody else seems to be a more obvious young candidate for that position.\"\n\nThere are still plenty of reservations among Democrats about Ocasio-Cortez's becoming the face of the party. She is a frequent target of conservatives, who portray her as an out-of-touch extremist and often use her as a villain in campaign ads and fundraising efforts.\n\n\"Her politics are just too far left for this party,\" a chair of a state party that sends a large number of delegates to Democratic presidential conventions, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly, said of Ocasio-Cortez as a potential national candidate. \"I don't agree with most of her policy positions, but she's showing fight, which a lot of people are looking for their members of Congress to do, and they're just not seeing it.\"\n\nStill, her ability to connect with the public is something her Democratic colleagues are starting to embrace. Recently, she conducted a presentation for her colleagues on how to reach influencers and use social media. She showed House Democrats a video she produced around the theme \"What's in my bag?\" in which she also discussed politics and policy. A Democratic lawmaker recalled the video got more than 2 million views.\n\n\"Two million people, right?\" said a lawmaker who listened to the presentation. \"If you added all of mine up together and multiplied them by 10, I wouldn't get to 2 million.\"\n\nA moderate House Democrat told NBC News that, despite not being a \"big supporter\" of Ocasio-Cortez, they privately voted for her to be the ranking member of the House Oversight Committee when she unsuccessfully ran for the post last year. The moderate Democratic lawmaker said the reason is that \"she is one of the top-tier communicators\" in the party and the Oversight Committee job is primarily a \"messaging and marketing\" role.\n\nBut the lawmaker didn't wish to reveal the vote publicly, a sign there is still wariness about how Ocasio-Cortez might appeal to more centrist and independent voters.\n\nOcasio-Cortez ultimately landed a spot on the Energy and Commerce Committee, which deals with a host of issues she cares about related to climate change and income inequality.  Her evolution from an outside agitator to an inside player in the party has fueled widespread speculation among Democrats about her political ambitions.\n\nOcasio-Cortez isn't entertaining the idea of seeking higher office. Her closest advisers reject the premise that Sanders is handing the baton to her as the titular leader of the progressive movement. They also insist she isn't plotting to challenge Schumer for his Senate seat in 2028, mount a run for governor of New York in 2026 or start organizing a bid for the White House. But they also aren't ruling anything out.\n\nOcasio-Cortez declined a request for an interview.\n\n\"There is no 10-year plan,\" said a close Ocasio-Cortez adviser, who was granted anonymity to discuss internal planning. \"She is going to be who she is. She is the last person to think about how a decision is going to impact her down the road, which candidly can be a little frustrating to those of us who are advising her.\"\n\n\"She can move quickly and authentically in a way few other elected leaders can,\" the adviser added. \"If she jumps into anything, it will be because she truly believes she can make real change.\"\n\nMany Democratic leaders said Ocasio-Cortez should keep all potential opportunities open.\n\n\"I think AOC has a massive future in front of her, and that's a decision that she's going to make. I mean, obviously you see lots of conversation about her running for Senate, her running for president. I think all of those options, if I was her campaign manager, are probably going to be on the table,\" said Jane Kleeb, chair of the Nebraska Democratic Party and the Democratic National Committee's association of state party chairs.\n\nIn the short term, her colleagues in the House believe her best play is to keep her focus on the job at hand.\n\n\"She has matured and evolved as a political leader in remarkable ways,\" Raskin said. \"She has gone from being a huge outside force to being a huge inside force.\"\n\nRyan Nobles is a correspondent covering Capitol Hill.\n\nMelanie Zanona is a Capitol Hill correspondent for NBC News.\n\nJonathan Allen is a senior national politics reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "âWe have leverageâ: Democrats gear up for debt battle\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nDemocrats still reeling from a divisive shutdown fight will need to find a strategy quickly to confront an even more consequential battle over the US debt ceiling.\n\nWhile Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer took the brunt of his partyâs ire for his handling of government funding, his bind stemmed from top Democratsâ lack of a cohesive response once House Republicans passed their own plan to avert a shutdown.\n\nNow that House Speaker Mike Johnson proved he can squeeze through tough legislation along party lines, the challenge for Democrats looks different.\n\nIf the GOP canât get the votes to lift the debt limit on its own â and Republican senators and aides are skeptical they can, given resistance from fiscal hardliners â theyâll need Democratic votes. Democrats have two basic options: Engage with Republicans on a bipartisan agreement that could include Democratic priorities like disaster relief, or dig in and say itâs the other partyâs problem.\n\nDemocrats are discussing now how to avoid stumbling into another internal split this summer when the US exhausts its borrowing limit, according to interviews with a dozen party lawmakers. After the shutdown fiasco, and given their votersâ clamor for more pushback against the Trump White House, they do not want to be caught flat-footed this time.\n\nâWe will need a strategy, and we need to be unified,â Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told Semafor. âWe have leverage. And we should use it.â\n\nThe shutdown battle exposed Democratsâ deep strategic divisions, and theyâre entering the debt fight with lots of disparate ideas. As Schumer starts preliminary talks with his leadership team, his caucus is cleaving between those who want to use the US checkbook as leverage and those who donât.\n\nâA great deal depends on whether the experience of the last two weeks is going to lead us to a more bipartisan effort in the future. Thatâs the threshold question,â said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., of the debt ceiling. âIf the answer is yes, we can talk about it.â\n\nSen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., who criticized most Democrats for flirting with a shutdown this month, said that when it comes to the debt, âI refuse to take a hostage like that.â\n\nâI canât support defaulting on our debt. Itâs just like shutting the government down. The impact will be catastrophic,â Fetterman told Semafor on Tuesday. Fetterman then spotted Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and added: âHe might disagree with me on that.â\n\nSanders declined to comment for this story. Still, many Democrats question why they should help Trumpâs party raise the debt ceiling when Republicans are planning trillions of dollars in tax cuts that will increase the deficit.\n\nâWhy should we do that?â asked Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. âI want to know what the Republicans are offering. They seem to think they can run this government with no help from the Democrats. Letâs watch them do it.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nThe government funding battle demonstrated Trumpâs singlehanded ability to muscle legislation through the House despite Johnsonâs small majority. That includes the budget that the Senate could take up as soon as next month, which sets up a $4 trillion debt ceiling increase.\n\nMany in the party are hopeful the scars from the shutdown fight will mean a more cohesive position on the debt ceiling.\n\nâThereâs an internalization [that] weâve got to be less risk-averse. And I think Schumer gets that. And I think there will be more thinking well in advance about what to do on the debt ceiling,â said Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt.\n\nSenate Republicans discussed whether to follow the House and try to raise the debt ceiling along party lines at their weekly lunch Tuesday but reached no decision, according to multiple members. Majority Leader John Thune privately touted a GOP-only tax bill as the easiest path forward on the debt ceiling.\n\nStill, several sources warned Semafor that the $4 trillion level under discussion might not last through the midterms; if Republicans strike a deal with Democrats, they could suspend the debt ceiling through the next election, removing a political headache.\n\nWhile itâs still possible to cajole enough conservatives to get a debt bill passed without Democrats, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said Republicans will be âreluctantâ to try that: âAll of these things are done better if theyâre done in a bipartisan way.â\n\nHouse Democrats arenât so sure. Republicans pushed their partyâs government funding bill through the chamber with the support of just one Democrat. And recent deaths of former Democratic Reps. Raul Grijalva of Arizona and Sylvester Turner of Texas gave Johnson more room to maneuver.\n\nâTheyâre feeling emboldened,â one House Democrat said of the GOP. âI donât see them coming to us for anything â¦ Theyâre going to do what they can by themselves.â\n\nBut if Republicans do come asking for help, Democrats want real concessions.\n\nâIf we have other things in the bill, obviously, weâll look at it,â Rep. Juan Vargas, D-Calif., told Semafor.\n\nAs of right now, he added heâs a âhell no.â\n\nThe Bipartisan Policy Center expects the Treasury Department to stop being able to pay its bills sometime between mid-July and early October â later in the year than many had expected, said Elizabeth Pancotti, a former adviser to Sanders and now the managing director of policy and advocacy at progressive nonprofit Groundwork Collaborative.\n\nThe longer runway gives members more time to negotiate. It also means more time for Democrats to stew over Trumpâs use of executive power.\n\nâThey seem to get more pissed every day,â Pancotti said. âObviously, default is bad; avoiding default is good â but there does come a breaking point.â\n\nDemocrats pride themselves on being responsible and not playing games with the debt ceiling. But this monthâs painful shutdown fight has made them rethink their tactics, and the debt ceiling is undeniably a possible leverage point for Schumer and his caucus.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, while he doesnât have the filibuster at his disposal, may also find his partyâs votes are needed. Back in 2017, Schumer and then-House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi were able to negotiate with Trump directly.\n\nCoordination will be critical. If Schumer and Jeffries canât agree on a path forward, ideally before Republicans approach their members with a plan, Democrats risk becoming further enmeshed in the infighting that ensued when Schumer broke from much of his party on government funding.\n\nOne prominent progressive is in favor of avoiding any gamesmanship over the debt ceiling. Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., wants to go back to Sen. Mitch McConnellâs old plan . The gist: The limit rises automatically, and Congress gets a fast-tracked disapproval vote that likely fails.\n\nâWhat was good when Obama was in office seemed to work pretty well. Letâs do it again,â Merkley told Semafor.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nThree Democratic senators are retiring in blue-leaning swing states ahead of the 2026 midterms. And the party doesnât sound too worried about it.\n\nEven as Republicans promise to make New Hampshire, Minnesota and Michigan into battles next year, Senate Democrats said this week that retiring incumbents in those states would give them good opportunities to elect younger and more diverse candidates.\n\nâHow can I be someone who just replaced my senior senator and not think that itâs a good idea?â said Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, who replaced ex-Sen. Debbie Stabenow this year. Sheâs working to ensure Democrats hold her fellow Michigander Gary Petersâ seat after he exits next year.\n\nâOnly in the US Senate could it be radical to retire at 66 years old, right?â Slotkin quipped of Peters.\n\nItâs an apt moment to consider new recruits for the caucus run by Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, 74, whoâs feeling an onslaught of grassroots frustration over his decision to not pick a government funding fight with President Donald Trump.\n\nSchumer will have to defend the seats being vacated by Peters, Sen.

Jeanne Shaheen in New Hampshire â at 78, the oldest of the three Democrats whoâve opted to retire.\n\nThe three-term Shaheen told Semafor she was cognizant of ânot wanting to be here if I were in a position that I could no longer do a good job for New Hampshire and do a good job for the country.â Republicans may have tried to make her age an issue if she ran again, though former Senate campaigns chief Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., said she would have had a âvery strongâ chance of winning again.\n\nA poll conducted last month for the conservative news site NHJournal found 60% of likely voters, including 49% of Democrats, were concerned about Shaheenâs age if she sought a new term. The same poll put former GOP Gov. Chris Sununu ahead of Shaheen in a potential match-up; one day before her announcement, Sununu told the Washington Times that he might run for the seat, because âshe is very vulnerable and very beatable.â\n\nFormer Sen. Scott Brown, who lost to Shaheen in 2014, also met with Senate Republicans this week.\n\nDemocrats now see Rep. Chris Pappas, 44, as the likeliest candidate to replace Shaheen; heâd also defuse the age issue in the race. In Michigan and Minnesota, leading candidates include two younger women: state Sen. Mallory McMorrow in the former and Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan in the latter.\n\nâYou look at some of the candidates in these different states that are considering it, [and] thatâs a lot of exciting young energy that I think can really help the Democratic Party,â said New Jersey Sen. Andy Kim, 42, who challenged disgraced former Sen. Bob Menendez last year after he was indicted on bribery charges.\n\nâThe Democratic caucus on the House side, itâs older than the Republican side,â Kim added. âI think itâs the same on the Senate side as well.â\n\nThe partyâs retirements are unlikely to stop with the three senators who have already announced. Illinois Democrats also expect Sen. Dick Durbin, 80, to leave at the end of this term, though he has not announced his plans. Former GOP Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., 83, is also retiring after next year.\n\nIn this article:\n\nNational Republican Senatorial Committee Chair Tim Scott celebrated Shaheenâs retirement, and the committee shared a memo that suggested the state was shifting right â Republicans gained ground even as Donald Trump lost it last year.\n\nYet GOP strategist Jim Merrill, who is not working with any candidate, said that Shaheen might have been more vulnerable than a new candidate.\n\nâGiven what happened with Biden last year, and the fact that sheâd be 80 if she won again, the age question was coming up,â he said. âShaheen wasnât holding town halls, wasnât having many interactions with voters. A campaign against her would have highlighted her energy and engagement, and that wonât happen now.â\n\nThereâs ample reason to believe Democrats can hold New Hampshire, Michigan and Minnesota â even with the retirements of Peters, Smith and Shaheen. This isnât like the crisis Democrats faced last year in West Virginia, which instantly turned red when former Sen. Joe Manchin retired.\n\nManchin was the last electable Democrat in a state racing to the right; by contrast, Republicans havenât won a Senate race in New Hampshire since 2010, and itâs been far longer in Minnesota and Michigan.\n\nThe Biden debacle is still rippling through Democratic politics, but it was one of many crises driven by aging politicians that the party faced â and ignored â for most of last year. The late California Sen. Dianne Feinsteinâs decline caused repeated problems, from her botched questioning of now-Justice Amy Coney Barrett to her bungling of allegations against now-Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nIn the House, two elderly Democrats died this year after campaigning with cancer diagnoses. The subsequent deaths of Sylvester Turner and Raul Grijalava will make it easier for the House GOP to move legislation for months, until their states can hold special elections for their safe seats.\n\nNotably, Shaheen was showing no Feinstein-like signs of decline or illness, which also contributed to two elderly House Democrats (Jerry Nadler and David Scott) losing their prime committee spots to younger challengers earlier this year.\n\nBut Democratsâ interest in electing forty-somethings to replace her as well as the Peters and Smith shows a healthy desire to move beyond the Biden experience.\n\nAnd it represents one more chink in the armor of decorum that protected the late Robert Byrd and Thad Cochran, who won their final terms despite being too feeble to fulfill them.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "House Democrats organize digital creators to counter Trumpâs speech\n\nSign up for Semafor Media: Mediaâs essential read. Read it now .\n\nAhead of President Donald Trumpâs first major address since his inauguration in January, House Democrats are leaning heavily into a new media strategy to push back against his agenda.\n\nOn Tuesday, as Trump addresses a joint session of Congress, House Democratic leadership will welcome at least 40 digital media creators and new-media journalists to get out the caucusâ message, a Democratic aide told Semafor.\n\nBefore Trumpâs speech on Tuesday, Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries will host members of Congress, their guests, and dozens of digital creators, including the YouTuber Brian Tyler Cohen, podcaster Jessica Yellin, and creators from Call to Activism and Crooked Media, among others.\n\nAfter the speech, House Democrats will hold their first post-address spin room for new media and digital creators. Several lawmakers have invited guests to the speech whoâve been impacted by the Trump administrationâs early moves, including fired federal workers , and the digital creators will be able to chat with them.\n\nIn the months since Trumpâs election, House Democrats have been testing out new media strategies, hoping to right some of the errors made during the last election and begin to level the playing field with conservative new media. At a press event at the Capitol last week, Democrats invited dozens of influencers, encouraging them to clip the event and interview lawmakers. Party leaders have privately discussed digital tactics that include increasing their output of straight-to-camera video posts, and even moving away from written press releases in favor of a social video-first messaging strategy.\n\nAs Semafor previously reported, congressional Democrats have been meeting privately with ideologically-aligned influencers who have been engaging members of Congress on how to improve their social videos, demonstrating everything from proper camera techniques to which type of mini microphone to buy.\n\nJeffries in particular has adopted a media strategy that has elevated his profile and made him a ubiquitous presence across political media. Since the beginning of the new Congress, the Democratic minority leader has been a regular fixture on cable television, participated in numerous podcast interviews, and begun sharing short-form videos. Much of the focus of the content was political, but the messaging was also intended to demonstrate Democratsâ looseness with podcasters. Stephen A. Smith, the popular ESPN sports commentator, applauded Jeffries last month for appearing on his podcast and displaying a strong grasp of New York professional and college basketball.\n\nStill, not all of Jeffriesâ efforts have been well-received. Critics online have picked at everything from Jeffriesâ occasionally vague answers in interviews to his camerawork.\n\nOther Democrats individually have taken engagement with left-leaning podcasters and posters a step further. Rep. Ro Khanna this week invited Carlos Eduardo Espina, a human rights advocate with over 13 million followers, to be his guest at Trumpâs speech to Congress.\n\nIn an interview with Semafor on Tuesday, the California congressman said that Democrats need to view left-leaning creators like Espina as part of Democratsâ political movement, not simply as vehicles to get the partyâs message out. He said that while he believed the recent initiatives are a step in the right direction, the relationship between the party and creators is still a one-way street. His decision to invite Espina to the speech on Tuesday was meant to signal to his followers that they are important parts of the political conversation.\n\nâThatâs what the right does better than us. We treat our podcasters, our influencers, as, âOh, thereâs an election coming up. We got to get to the young voters, letâs go schedule a bunch of interviews with them,ââ he told Semafor, referring to content creators. âThe right takes their podcasters, whether itâs Charlie Kirk or whether itâs Ben Shapiro or others, and says, âYouâre part of our actual movement. Youâre going to help determine who makes up our Cabinet, and take part in the governing of this country.â And thatâs what I think we need to do with our base of influencers.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor media"

      "text": "âPeople want changeâ: Democrats flip their script for Trumpâs second term\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nWith the progressive âresistanceâ quiet ahead of Donald Trumpâs second term, congressional Democrats are making their own shift: Theyâre turning away from past portrayals of Trump as a human wrecking ball and toward more potential collaboration.\n\nAfter ignoring a Republican crackdown on undocumented immigration for months last year, Senate Democrats holstered their filibuster power on Thursday and prepared to work on the bill â which Trump could end up signing into law thanks to their support. Democrats are currently debating whether to also advance a GOP plan to debate sanctions on the International Criminal Court for targeting Israeli leaders with arrest warrants.\n\nOn top of that, several Democrats met this week with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whose nomination as Trumpâs health secretary could eventually become a partisan battle given Kennedyâs vaccine skepticism and other unconventional views. Senate Democrats are unlikely to bear hug most of Trumpâs nominees beyond their colleague Marco Rubio and a handful of others, but theyâre making clear theyâll at least meet with the president-electâs most polarizing picks.\n\nâItâs just accepting the reality that Trump won. And us just saying heâs a chaotic guy goes nowhere. Thatâs just baked into peopleâs consciousness,â Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., told Semafor of the partyâs strategy. âThe fact is, people want change. So that means we have to be willing to change as well.â\n\nDemocrats are now experiencing the disorienting challenge that Republicans did four years ago after Biden and his party took complete control of Washington. For the first two years of Bidenâs term, Republicans briefly shelved hyper-partisanship and collaborated to a surprising degree with Democrats on infrastructure, gun safety, same-sex marriage and microchip manufacturing.\n\nItâs too early to say that Trumpâs presidency will end up with the same number of bipartisan policymaking victories â he squandered several opportunities during his first term to address immigration, background checks for gun buyers and roads and bridges. Yet itâs clear that Democrats are not looking to play the role of early obstructionists the way they did when Trump first took office; instead, theyâre looking to disarm GOP attacks that they are soft on Israel and the border.\n\nSome of them are even open to engaging in conversations with the GOP on bigger border security moves as well as tax cuts, the two central pieces of Trumpâs Hill agenda.\n\nStill, theyâre also digging in for a potentially huge fight later over taxes on the wealthy and corporations, Trumpâs tariffs and perhaps his deportation agenda. But now that Trump canât run for president again, Democrats are no longer building their political strategy around highlighting his most erratic comments.\n\nWhen Trump said this week he wanted to rename the Gulf of Mexico, for example, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer sarcastically quipped that he first must work with Democrats on lowering consumer prices.\n\nâWeâve seen the movie â¦ eight years ago. It was all a surprise to us,â said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va. âNow we know the basic playbook.â\n\nKaine said his experience in the minority during Trumpâs first term has him steeled for multitasking: âOn a given day, Iâm doing both things: Trying to get things passed, and also trying to stop bad things from happening.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nJust a few days ago, some Republicans expected Democrats to block the Laken Riley Act, which would detain immigrants who entered the country illegally when they are accused of theft-related crimes. Instead Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., helped Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., whip up surprising support from his party.\n\nâIâm thinking theyâre listening to the American public better, or paying attention to whatâs actually happening on the ground,â said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., a member of party leadership who was also in the middle of some of those Biden-era deals.\n\nShe said sheâs âsurprisedâ at the early cooperation but skeptical of where it ultimately goes: âI wouldnât say this is going to be a marker of a fully cooperating minority, no.â\n\nIf Trump leads Republicans fully into party-line policymaking after the Laken Riley and ICC bills, it could quickly chill the bipartisanship in the Senate. Already Majority Leader John Thune announced the chamber will vote on conservative abortion legislation later this month, and many of Trumpâs nominees will get few Democratic votes.\n\nDemocrats are already amping up their attacks on top Republicans for moving Trump nominees through Senate committees before proper vetting is complete.\n\nStill, itâs just as possible that Democrats try to maintain their current bipartisan energy for as long as possible. Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., said heâs hoping to restart aisle-crossing border negotiations with Republicans, which could chill their effort to move a border spending bill through the party-line budget reconciliation process.\n\nAnd Sen. John Hickenlooper, D-Colo., said heâd be interested in entering into tax talks with Republicans â so long as they set up guardrails against giving tax breaks to the wealthy.\n\nâWithin that, thereâs a million things that need to be decided. So Iâd be happy to try and find compromises wherever possible,â Hickenlooper told Semafor.\n\nProgressive Democrats are loath to describe their approach as fully conciliatory.\n\nSen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., is one of the more than half-dozen Democrats meeting with Kennedy this week. He said he has âserious reservationsâ about the health secretary nomineeâs views, though he was âwilling to take the meeting.â\n\nâIâm willing to meet with all nominees. I met with the nominee for Secretary of Education [Tuesday], even though Trump is calling for the abolition of the Department of Education,â Markey told Semafor.\n\nDemocrats are still getting back their footing after their November shellacking, which handed Republicans total control of government for the first time since the end of 2018. Theyâve conspicuously shied away from bombastic attacks on Trump and his nominees, preferring to let Republicans answer for any controversy and keeping the majority party guessing about where they might land on legislation.\n\nThere are early signs that, as Trumpâs Cabinet nominees head into their hearings next week, Democrats will browbeat them for their views and for their fealty to the president-elect. And if Republicans, as expected, pursue much of their agenda without Democratic votes, the minority party will fight back.\n\nIt might just sound more like a policy argument than an anti-Trump one.\n\nâThereâll be plenty of opportunities for us to fight on matters of real principle, where our argument is that thatâs going to make life harder and more expensive for people,â Welch said. âBut not just because we donât like Trump.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Jeffries takes heat as Democratsâ base seeks anti-Trump fight\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nHakeem Jeffries is three seats away from the House majority. First, though, he must face a problem thatâs familiar to his Senate Democratic colleagues: He has no clear plan to answer activists clamoring for more anti-Trump fight.\n\nJeffries confronted that pushback during a stop on his book tour last week, just as Republicans started to field public frustration with the layoffs and cuts imposed by President Donald Trumpâs Department of Government Efficiency. And after local progressive protesters disrupted Jeffries during that Chicago appearance, several House Democratic staffers privately grumbled to Semafor that the leader should be more hands-on.\n\nAsked if Jeffries is feeling heat from the left, former Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., responded that âoh, I think so.â\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, has drawn his fair share of progressive fury since becoming Democratic leader across the Capitol. But his fellow New Yorker Jeffries is experiencing the first taste of life as a caucus leader under Trump â whose pugnacious style tends to provoke calls for all-out rhetorical combat from the left.\n\nStill, many Democrats defend him, even to the point of hitting the partyâs base for being counterproductive. Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., a former top leader himself, likened progressivesâ recent outcry to the âdefund the policeâ messaging that damaged the Democratic brand back in 2020.\n\nâThatâs the way they do it,â Clyburn said of activists. âThey donât focus on the problem.â\n\nA spokesperson for the House minority leader did not address the progressive protests against Jeffries, but pointed to the constituents who last week peppered Republicans with tough questions about DOGE.\n\nDuring Trumpâs first term, Democrats quickly embraced a sprawling network of anti-Trump groups who tormented Republican incumbents and the attorneys who slowed his administration down in court. Jeffriesâ and Schumerâs members have revived the latter part of that strategy, even if theyâve more frequently protested alongside federal workers than outwardly progressive activists.\n\nBut the party is far less popular than it was eight years ago, even with its own base. Polling this month from Quinnipiac University found just 40% of self-identified Democrats approving of the job their party was doing in Congress, alongside 19% of independents. (Forty percent of independents, and 79% of Republicans, approved of how the GOP was doing.)\n\nâWell, the polling numbers always take a while to come through,â Jayapal said of the 21% overall approval of Democrats. âPeople want to see Democrats fighting, and I think we are showing what it looks like to fight back.â\n\nThey havenât been helped by a more splintered media environment that can mischaracterize moments when top Democrats address their approach to combating Trump. One recent example: After Jeffries pointed out that Trumpâs party controls all of Congress and the White House, meaning Republicans have sole ownership over big decisions like funding the government, progressives mocked him for asking, âWhat leverage do we have?â\n\nâDo you agree that the Democratic Party has no leverage?â Zeteo founder Mehdi Hasan asked Rep. Ilhan Omar, playing the clip for the Minnesota Democrat during a live appearance.\n\nOmar defended Jeffries, crediting him with shaping a âblueprintâ for fighting back.\n\nOn Monday, the progressive group Justice Democrats, which helped elect Omar, shared a story about donations to the House Democratic campaign arm from a lobbying firm with ties to Elon Musk as evidence that Jeffries had given up his âleverage.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nFor quite a few House Democrats, the tension is beyond unhelpful.\n\nâWeâve got to stop the circular firing squad,â Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., told Semafor.\n\nBut for the progressive activists who showed up at Jeffriesâ event, it was a question of priorities.\n\nâFor many people, it was difficult to reconcile the crisis people thought we were in and a calm discussion of a book,â said Kathy Tholin, co-chair of the Indivisible Chicago Alliance, which sent around 100 people to show up outside Jeffriesâ event last Wednesday. (Inside, Jeffries was repeatedly interrupted by the left-wing group Climate Defiance, which accused him of picking âdonors over voters.â)\n\nâThere were a lot of folks who saw this event and thought the optics were questionable,â the 69-year-old Tholin added. âMaybe we should be organizing right now, not holding a book tour.â\n\nSome House Democratic aides privately agree with her. One of them called it âtone-deafâ of Jeffries to hold a book event while Trump asserts sweeping executive power, sidestepping Congress to cancel contracts and dismantle agencies he sees as wasteful.\n\nNot all of Jeffriesâ fellow Democratic lawmakers think the partyâs left flank should stand down. After a rally at the Capitol against the GOPâs still-forthcoming tax bill, Connecticut Sen. Chis Murphy said he doesnât worry about activists pressing lawmakers to do more.\n\nâPeople should hold us accountable,â Murphy told Semafor. âPeople should demand that we are really loud in the face of the seizure of our government by the billionaire class.â\n\nHouse Democrats have more than 18 months before the midterms to convince voters they deserve the majority â and with it, the opportunity to serve as a check on Trump.\n\nBut as they develop that message, they may encounter more progressive pressure than Senate Democrats, who have both a tougher 2026 map and the legislative filibuster at their disposal. Jeffries is experiencing especially pointed pushback in part because he is a newbie to his role; the iconic status that former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi attained in many corners of the left may be inviting subtle comparisons between the two.\n\nâYou got to strike out on somebody,â Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., told Semafor. âYou got to hold somebody to account. And so I donât judge them for that, but I absolutely think heâs doing his job and doing it well.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "âDemocrats have just become uncool.â\n\nSign up for Semafor Americana: An insiderâs guide to American power. Read it now .\n\nDavid Hogg was thrust into politics weeks before his 18th birthday. He survived the mass shooting at his high school in Parkland, Florida. With a group of classmates, he co-founded March for Our Lives, began advocating for an assault weapons ban and other gun regulations, and faced a deluge of angry, sometimes conspiratorial reactions.\n\nHogg also got involved in the Democratic Party, where he grew unhappy with how it fumbled its messaging in 2024, how poorly it mobilized âinfluencers,â and how it talked about young people. Now 24, Hogg is one of the candidates for DNC vice chair, a role that often goes to elected officials â several of them are running for the three seats â to do unglamorous party work. Hogg had other ideas for the position, sharing them at a moment when the party is panicking about its inability to compete with the MAGA movement in social media and podcasts. He talked with Americana about that, and this is an edited version of the conversation.\n\nThis conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nDavid Weigel: Democrats have been deluged this week, and I see a lot of unhappiness with how theyâre responding to Trump. What would be different, if you were in the DNC right now?\n\nDavid Hogg: Iâd be going everywhere and talking to young people and pushing back against the right-wing narratives. Now that Trump is repealing a lot of these Biden executive orders, a lot of people are asking: Wait, Democrats did that? Wait, we had that office to work on abortion rights? Biden did what to lower prescription drug costs? Oh, man, that sounds pretty good! But now only that Trumpâs been elected are we actually hearing a lot about it. Thatâs a prime example of what we did wrong this cycle.\n\nIf Iâm elected to this position, I want to go around the country and talk to younger people in the areas that we saw shift the most to the right. A lot of the areas that we saw shift most dramatically to the right were where rents went up the most. Thereâs obviously going to be an inherent disconnect between them and a bunch of rich Beltway consultants dictating our messaging, because they donât worry about the rent. But the biggest shift to the right that we saw with young people was related to whether they were in high school during COVID. Gen Z is not a monolith.\n\nA lot of people older than you are asking why young men shifted to the right. What happened during COVID? What else explains it?\n\nIt exacerbated the loneliness epidemic our young people are going through. That was acutely affecting young men, as a result of them being online more. And a lot of these social media companies, in part because of their fear of being broken up, have started promoting a lot more right-wing propaganda. Why are we seeing Mark Zuckerberg talking about masculinity and how great Donald Trump is? Not because I think he necessarily believes it, but because heâs afraid of being Meta broken up.\n\nThat said â and this might be a bit controversial â it doesnât feel to me like thereâs a place for men in our party right now. Frankly, I think that thereâs a lot of work that weâve got to do to address that. Empathy isnât a zero-sum game. Thatâs one of the things that kills me most about the mentality in our party. We act as if we can only talk about what young women are going through â that we canât also talk about what young men are going through â and we have to break that mentality.\n\nWhat explains that?\n\nI feel like Democrats have just become uncool. For a long time, Republicans were the ones walking around with moral superiority. If you werenât a God-fearing, straight person that has a white picket fence and a nuclear family, you were inherently the problem with America. That was before. Then people reacted so viscerally to Donald Trumpâs election that a lot of liberals started policing everybody around us. It gave us a sense that weâre morally superior, weâre better than other people.\n\nWeâve got to change that. Young men might not even disagree with us. They agree that we need to address gun violence and climate change. But they donât want to be judged. And thereâs this mentality that Iâve heard on the left: âItâs not my job to educate you.â We have to end that. It is our job to educate people! If you donât want to do that, frankly, politics probably isnât for you. I know from my work on gun violence that itâs not comfortable conversations and surrounding ourselves with people that agree with us thatâs going to make progress. Itâs uncomfortable conversations.\n\nWhat sort of uncomfortable conversations did you have?\n\nIâm not saying that everybody has to do this, or everybody can do this, but there were armed gunmen that followed us around on our tour when I was 18 years old. At some stops, I went out and talked to them and had a conversation. I could either choose to live in a comfortable delusion, or I could choose to live in an uncomfortable reality where change actually might be possible. I was able to break through the disinformation, because I could show them that Iâm not a crisis actor. I really am just a young person that doesnât want kids to be shot in school anymore. I could say, hey you know that AR-15 that youâre holding right now â should someone who threatens to shoot up a high school be able to own that?\n\nI was in the shooting club in college. I wasnât, initially, very popular there. But I didnât call these guys names and say terrible things about them. And I think the reason we were able to create change after Parkland is that it wasnât scripted, and it was real. If somebody asked us, should we ban assault weapons? We didnât pivot. We answered the damn question, and we said yes, despite what all those pollsters and those consultants would have told us to do. Iâve heard, âWell, weâve just got to get on Discord,â or, âWhat if we get on TikTok?â But a good message will move itself.\n\nHow did the Democrats play the TikTok story, after voting to ban it unless it was sold to an American buyer?\n\nHonestly, not great! Trump is once again using a stunt against us. We didnât go out there and talk about how he was the guy who wanted to ban it. Now, Iâll tell you, the low-information voters that weâre talking to are going to think that Donald Trump saved TikTok, because thatâs literally what the company said, and that is a huge problem thatâs only going to make our youth vote issue a hell of a lot worse. We cannot afford to be a watering can when Donald Trump is a fire hose of constant content and media. That means not being afraid to go on podcasts and talk to people. Thereâs so much vetting of these podcasts or networks before people go on. Come on. We just need to get out there and share our damn message.\n\nOne criticism I have heard of you running for this position is that you went after Mary Peltola after she lost her seat in Alaska. Was that a mistake? Was that the sort of bold thing Democrats can do to draw attention?\n\nWhat I wish I put in that tweet, in the first place, was that she voted to defund and permanently abolish the office of gun violence prevention that survivors of gun violence and so many others had fought for years to create. This was about helping to address gun suicides and making sure that there was funding available to respond to mass shootings in the same way that FEMA responds to natural disasters. I know there canât be a one-size-fits-all approach to politics. I know this firsthand after years of campaigning in swing states and red states. But she didnât just vote against some gun law. The reactions I saw were like: Is David upset because she voted against banning assault weapons? No. Of course you canât do that in Alaska. It was something that eight Republicans voted for. I wish sheâd voted for it, and I wish she won.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

      "text": "âGive us a little timeâ: Democrats search for a guiding principle against Trump\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nAfter a rudderless post-election run, Democrats are suddenly showing some fight against President Donald Trump.\n\nYet unlike the progressive ascendance of eight years ago, itâs not clear who is leading the charge.\n\nâI canât answer that. Give us a little time,â Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., told Semafor. âThis is brand new.â\n\nItâs not clear how much time theyâll get, however, as the fight to define Democratsâ future plays out in real time with unavoidable tests of clout for the partyâs disparate wings. Thereâs a DNC chairmanship election around the corner, Senate Democrats are wrestling with how much resistance to mount to Trumpâs Cabinet and House Democrats are gaming out how to use their significant leverage.\n\nAt this time in 2017, their base was literally marching in the streets and veteran Democrats responded by racing to airports to protest Trumpâs travel ban. Thatâs not happening this time â yet this weekâs sweeping Trump pardon of Jan. 6 defendants clearly reawakened the partyâs moribund activist impulses.\n\nâWeâre obviously in a bit of disarray,â one Democratic senator told Semafor. âI donât think people are really completely sure about what lesson is to be learned in this election.â\n\nNot only that, but the party is clearly divided over tactics. Many Democrats were willing to accommodate a quick approval of Trumpâs nominee to lead the Central Intelligence Agency this week. But Sen. Chris Murphy put a stop to that and made clear heâs not interested in playing nice.\n\nâPersonally, I donât want to give Republicans an inch on their claims they care about national security after their pardons,â said Murphy, D-Conn. âMy hope is that weâre going to be down on the floor and on TV and back in our states talking about the danger of these pardons.â\n\nRatcliffe was still confirmed Thursday, 74-25, with significant Democratic support.\n\nThe Democratic split between antagonism and accommodation is playing out in full view among the partyâs most prominent members: Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., is striking a collaborative note while voting against Democratic delay efforts, Murphy is embracing aggressive opposition, and others are trying to do both.\n\nTake Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, among the dozen or so Democrats angling to be in the mix on border security negotiations. Even as he does that, heâs drawing red lines for Trump.\n\nâIâm going to stand up against this guy when he does stupid stuff like he did the other day in pardoning these violent criminals,â Kelly told Semafor, referring to Jan. 6 offenders who attacked police officers. âCan I think of a worse decision that a president has made in recent history? I canât come up with one.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nAfter Trumpâs first win, it was fairly obvious that the left was leading much of the partyâs messaging. Progressives like Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren became national figures and top-tier presidential candidates while opposing Trumpâs policies and nominees, setting up the 2020 election as a referendum on him.\n\nTrump wonât be on the ballot in 2028, though, and some of the newest Democratic stars are doing things differently. Take Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., who has won two races in a red-leaning state: He voted for stricter detention policies for undocumented immigrants last week but has also led the charge on voting rights and weakening the filibuster.\n\nWarnock said in an interview that heâll try to support Trump nominees if he sees them demonstrate character and competence. He added that heâs open to bipartisan work on immigration, particularly a comprehensive proposal.\n\nBut he condemned Trump on the same front that Kelly did.\n\nâThe J6 pardons cross a real line,â Warnock said. âIn one fell swoop, he gave cover and a permission structure for political violence in this country. This goes beyond any kind of partisan issues. We should all be concerned.â\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is giving his members space to work with the GOP on immigration and Trump nominees but kept his caucus together to oppose a Republican abortion bill this week. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said on Thursday his caucus would âmake decisions based on whatâs right for the districts that we represent, and the politics will take care of themselves.â\n\nAnd though Democrats have gravitated toward senators current and former in their presidential primaries, governors like Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania will undoubtedly help steer their partyâs direction â along with some Democrats who you probably havenât even heard of yet.\n\nâWeâre figuring it out,â said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., a former DNC chair and vice presidential nominee. âThereâs new leaders emerging. Thatâs a good thing. Our party needs that.â\n\nMany Democratic stars from the first Trump term are still influential. Harris became vice president and presidential nominee and could yet run for California governor; Booker and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., are in the top rungs of Schumerâs leadership team; Warren and Sanders are both on that team too, and leading the party on prominent committees.\n\nWhen they speak, many Democrats still listen closely.\n\nSanders said in an interview that heâd work with Trump on reducing interest rates and drug prices but oppose mass deportation and tax breaks for the wealthy.\n\nâYou have to look at the issues. It canât simply be âOh, itâs a Trump idea, we oppose it,ââ Sanders said.\n\nâOur job is to say, âThis is what you said: You want to cap interest rates, you want to cut prescription drug costs. Great, letâs do it â¦ And if you donât, then weâre exposing you as a hypocrite,ââ he added.\n\nOut of crisis comes opportunity. Itâs a wide-open playing field for Democrats to redefine their party.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting trend on view this year is the prospect that the party could embrace moderation and pragmatism more than ideological rigidity. But that may not last, for one big reason: Trumpâs style of governing creates a target-rich environment for Democrats.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, for example, Democrats were signaling they werenât interested in delaying Trumpâs Cabinet picks â but thatâs exactly what they are doing today. His decision to pardon Jan. 6 rioters and push ahead with Pete Hegsethâs Pentagon nomination have animated the opposition.\n\nKadia Goba contributed to this report.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "What can Democrats learn from the Brits?\n\nSign up for Semafor Americana: An insiderâs guide to American power. Read it now .\n\nThere are times when the Democratic Party looks enviously at the UKâs Labour Party; there are times when the envy runs the other way. And there are times when the left, in the English-speaking world, doesnât really know what to do. Thatâs the moment Prime Minister Keir Starmer is living in â victorious in a landslide last summer, but already deeply unpopular, facing anger from the populist right and disappointment from the populist left.\n\nâThe party had been routed in 2019, under Jeremy Corbyn, and was confronted by a question which has troubled many social democratic parties across the world,â said Patrick Maguire, the co-author (with Gabriel Pogrund) of Get In, a new history of Labourâs comeback under Starmer and strategist Morgan McSweeney. âWhat are we for? Can we win again? By 2019, the party had finished a doomed experiment with socialism, but it was in no mood to revisit Tony Blair and Bill Clintonâs âthird wayâ politics.â\n\nIn Get In , the two reporters for the Sunday Times get deep inside Starmerâs Labour Party, from their text messages to their private moments of doubt. (Starmer considered resigning after Labour lost a safe seat in a 2021 by-election.) Itâs a story with some lessons for Democrats â albeit none of them very easy or repeatable. We talked about the book as Starmer visited Washington this week, and this is an edited transcript of our conversation.\n\nDavid Weigel: One theme that comes up here, and that Iâve seen in the Democratic Party, is anger from the left at how the leadership doesnât listen to them â that it didnât nominate Bernie Sanders or run as populists. When Starmer took over, how prevalent was this idea that the left could have won had it not been undermined?\n\nPatrick Maguire: By 2020 it was harder to maintain that argument, because it had been defeated so comprehensively in the 2019 election. It couldnât just be explained away by structural disadvantages or external sabotage. The left has had its chance, and it had blown it, through its own incompetence and personal failings.\n\nBut itâs important to remember this â in 2020, the line on Keir Starmer was that he was essentially Jeremy Corbyn in a suit with a haircut. He was a Scandinavian social democrat. If anything, he pitched himself as the candidate of ideological continuity on big economic and foreign policy questions, while promising institutional change and professionalism. One of the big questions thatâs hung over the Labour Party for the past five years is: Was he lying knowingly about that? Thereâs an argument that Keir Starmer didnât mean quite a lot of it, and he was sort of mugged by reality.\n\nWhat was the importance of The Canary, the left-wing news source that supported Corbyn?\n\nPatrick: Labour Together was probably the closest thing we have in British politics to a Super PAC. It was reimagined under Morgan McSweeney with hundreds of thousands of pounds from donors supportive of the right of the Labour Party and resolutely opposed to Jeremy Corbyn. The Canary was hyper partisan. It was run on a shoestring. But it was incredibly popular. The Labour membership, by and large, distrusted the mainstream media â not without some justification. It was a feedback loop between members on the left that Morgan McSweeney and Imran Ahmed, whoâs now running the Center for Countering Digital Hate in the US, were determined to break.\n\nAnd that was all about lobbying advertisers and saying: Have you seen thereâs some sort of nasty conspiratorial content on The Canary? They are saying this Labour politician is in the pay of the Israeli embassy, or whatever. Stop funding fake news. Stop funding conspiracy theories. There was a very disciplined and deliberate and well-disguised campaign operatives on the right of the Labour Party to smash the only hyper-partisan and popular media infrastructure that left populism ever had in Britain.\n\nHow much changed after Boris Johnson resigned? One question that Democrats have here is: How much of their weakness is down to Donald Trump, and how much can they recover once his personality is off the scene. So how did that story play out with Johnson?\n\nGabriel Pogrund: The political genius of Boris Johnson was that â while he didnât have policy prescriptions that he steadfastly adhered to over the course of his career â he shrewdly positioned himself as being left on the economy and right on questions of culture and law and order. He was saying he would champion our National Health Service and also deport lots of migrants to Rwanda. That is the sweet spot in British electoral politics. And once Johnson had exited the stage, that created a space for Labour to inhabit, where by the time of the election, it was Starmer who was positioning himself as the person who would revive our straightened public services and also beat the Tories at their own game by restoring order at Britainâs borders.\n\nThe problem for Starmer is that he is now being outflanked by Nigel Farage. The right in the UK remains fragmented, but there are a lot of people who think that in due course, British politics could have one of those once a century realignments where the Tories are cannibalized by this new party, which has been formed by Farage and exists in his image: Reform UK. And many of the instincts that propelled Johnson donât exist within Keir Starmer. He has a contempt for politics and a distaste for politics, but a lot of people see him as being the personification of the establishment. Heâs got a knighthood, heâs got the word sir before his name, and he remains very vulnerable to insurgent politics for that reason.\n\nHow does inflation change things? It was punishing for Democrats here.\n\nPatrick: One of the great missed opportunities of British politics in this period is that for the entire era of zero interest rates, no party that was seriously threatening to win the election â with the brief exception of Corbynâs Labour in 2017 â was talking about taking advantage of those rates to borrow and invest. When [now-Chancellor] Rachel Reeves comes to that epiphany in 2021, it is already an idea that is running out of time. Reeves says, Iâm going to be the first green chancellor, and hereâs our $28 billion per year borrowing target. Hereâs our version of the Inflation Reduction Act. Itâs not actually until 2024 that the Blairite right of the Labour Party, people for whom fiscal responsibility is the cornerstone of Labour ever winning, put that idea to bed.\n\nThatâs a really tricky thing for the Labour Party, because the sweet spot of British politics is actually big statism, interventionism, plus a sort of populist, soft authoritarian offer on crime and migration. Right now, Labour is leaning very hard into the law and order and migration stuff, but it doesnât have an economic offer of commensurate radicalism.\n\nGabriel: They were inspired by Joe Biden and the IRA on an intellectual and political level, until, by dint of the global monetary situation, they werenât.\n\nIf youâre an ambitious Democrat â youâre Josh Shapiro, youâre Wes Moore â what lesson should you take away from Labourâs experience?\n\nPatrick: When Johnson was PM, it looked like the story was going to be one of Conservative Party hegemony for a long time. It seemed like politics had realigned and that certain groups of voters were, you know, lost forever to the left. And that was not necessarily true. If you are on the center left of politics in any democratic country, if you are willing to meet voters where they are â that means both your activist base and general election voters â it is about treating peopleâs views as legitimate. Itâs not telling them that theyâre wrong or telling them, we told you so.\n\nThatâs something the Labour Party under this leadership has been very careful not to do. Keir Starmer said: You know, if youâre a Brexit voter, if you want less migration, the Labour Party has to talk to you about that. We canât just say youâre wrong, your wages are lower because of unscrupulous bosses.\n\nGabriel: There is one thing to be said for the British model, which is that it does allow one to perform and demonstrate their politics in opposition. Corbyn was so vulnerable to the accusation of being wacky and deranged. You need politicians who can take a baseball bat to the idea that they are culturally and intellectually on a different planet to their voters. Thereâs Starmer. By 2024 he can say, Iâve killed Corbyn, Iâve killed Corbynism. I donât stand for that stuff. Whoever ends up representing Democrats in 2028, thereâs a compelling argument that their interests would be served by having some evidence of antagonism with the hard left.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

      "text": "Democrats look to government funding as their leverage against Trump\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nDemocrats held the Senate floor through the night this week in a painstaking but ultimately futile protest against President Donald Trumpâs budget chief.\n\nTheyâre about to get some real leverage.\n\nElon Muskâs dramatic reshaping of government, combined with Trumpâs torrent of executive actions and a confusing federal spending freeze, have cast serious doubt on the prospects for Congress to fund the government past March 14, according to interviews with a half-dozen senior Democratic senators and several worried Republicans.\n\nRepublicans will need Democratic votes in the Senate and the House to avoid a government shutdown and a debt default later this year, given the GOPâs narrow majorities in both chambers. Democrats say they see little rationale now to try to compromise with Republicans who have shown little interest in stopping Trumpâs aggressive use of executive power.\n\nâIt feels impossible,â Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told Semafor. âWhatâs the point of writing a budget if the presidentâs going to ignore it? Itâs a problem without precedent.â\n\nDemocrats want assurances from Trumpâs White House that any government funding deal would actually be implemented â a guarantee doesnât seem to be coming, as Musk continues his spending scrutiny and the legally disputed budget freeze lingers. Russ Vought, the conservative nemesis of many Democrats, will soon run Trumpâs budget office, another hurdle for a bipartisan funding pact.\n\nHouse and Senate Democrats got a taste of their future challenges in December, when Trump scuttled a bipartisan government funding accord. The two parties cut a bare-bones agreement to avoid a shutdown, but thereâs little evidence of tangible progress since then.\n\nAnd Democrats say they are in no mood to deal.\n\nâThis president is in this big power grab, saying that he can decide what to spend or not spend on anything. It kinda reduces your motivation to negotiate on stuff,â said Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn.\n\nFiguring out how to avoid a shutdown, she added, is âon them now,â referring to Republicans .\n\nUltimately, Democrats will have few good options if they opt out of negotiations on a spending deal that the administration might not make good on. They could support a âcontinuing resolutionâ stopgap bill, though that could eventually trigger a blunt defense cut thanks to a previous bipartisan agreement.\n\nOr Democrats could refuse to supply the votes to fund the government â which would be atypical for the party that typically tries to pin shutdowns on the GOP. Republicans are optimistic that those two bad options will force Democrats to the table.\n\nâLook at what the alternative is. Itâs either a year-long CR â which would still have to pass and get 60 votes and would create enormous problems and would trigger the sequester â or having the government shut down,â said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, the Appropriations Committee chair.\n\nâThe Democrats will be responsible for that, if they arenât cooperating,â she added.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer doesnât see it that way. He reframed the question as one for Republicans, who struggle to cobble together votes to avoid a shutdown or lift the debt ceiling: âTheyâre in charge, they have to work with us.â\n\nStill, several senior Democratic sources said the conditions for a real shutdown fight are starting to manifest in the halls of the Capitol. Collins is talking to Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., her counterpart on spending, but Murray said sheâs âdeeply worriedâ about the situation.\n\nShutdown talk in Washington is now baked into the news ecosystem, and the last one was a record-breaker from Trumpâs first term. Some Democrats say they are more worried than usual this time.\n\nâBecause thereâs so little dialog and communication,â said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., the minority whip.\n\nIn this article:\n\nDemocrats will have another opportunity to push for their priorities when the debt ceiling is set to expire, a point thatâs likely a few months away.\n\nâNormally, in order for us to address the debt limit, we have to pay bribes to the Democrats in terms of more spending,â said Sen. John Kennedy, R-La.\n\nKennedy said that Republicans will need to figure out a strategy between government funding and the debt by working with Trump. He predicted: âThatâs going to be a lively discussion.â\n\nMurphy said Democrats should dig in on the borrowing limit, too, given Republicansâ plans to cut taxes later this year.\n\nâWe should not be increasing the debt ceiling to help them pass a billionaire and corporate tax cut,â Murphy said, adding that the near-term crisis of government funding makes it âtougherâ to find a clear-cut strategy.\n\nBoth parties have used government funding deadlines as leverage, occasionally tipping the US into a shutdown. Democrats themselves briefly shut the government down in early 2018 to force a debate on immigration, though everyone forgot about that quickly after Trumpâs historically long partial shutdown over border wall funding.\n\nThe circumstances are somewhat similar now; Democrats donât want to fund his priorities, not to mention that they donât trust the GOP to fund theirs, even if they are written into law.\n\nâWe reach a deal on programs and what will be funded. And then the president undoes the deal and violates the law in doing so? That makes it impossible to have agreements. Obviously, this is a serious constitutional crisis,â said Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore. âThereâs no business as usual.â\n\nDemocratsâ activist base has woken up. Lawmakers are now rallying at government agencies and holding the Senate floor overnight. Does that mean a party whose identity is significantly more pro-government than the GOP is ready to shut down the government in protest?\n\nIâm not so sure.\n\nStill, shutdown fights often seem solvable, until they arenât. And if Democrats keep feeling ignored by Republicans amid pressure from progressives to fight, donât be surprised if things get even uglier come mid-March.\n\nThe March 14 deadline is pretty far away, relatively speaking. Congress has written and passed entire, massive bills in that timeframe â and many Republicans say itâs too early to get worried about Democratsâ positioning.\n\nâWeâre five weeks away from that. Thatâs like an eternity in this place,â said Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla.\n\nSenate Majority Whip John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said Congress will âget it doneâ and that heâs âgoing to make sure the government stays open.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Democrats still push diversity bills: 'We're not going to fade into the woodwork'\n\nWASHINGTON ‒ One bill aims to close the wage gap between men and women. Another wants to better protect voting rights. And one measure expands opportunities for more people of color to become doctors.\n\nSome Democratic lawmakers, hoping to restore rights and protect people of diverse backgrounds, are supporting bills this Congress to address disparities in health care, combat discrimination and level the playing field for women and people of color.\n\nNone of them stands a chance of passing in the Republican-controlled Congress or getting signed into law by President Donald Trump, these lawmakers acknowledge, especially they say with the GOP push to eliminate diversity initiatives and roll back civil rights gains.\n\nStill, some Democratic lawmakers of color and others continue to introduce bills, hoping the measures garner some attention or that history books will show they at least tried.\n\n\"Even though this is not the best administration or the best Congress to bring these things up, we can't not bring them up,'' said Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, a Democrat from New Jersey, who recently introduced a federal bill banning discrimination against hair textures and styles. \"We will continue to raise those issues. If it's this, if it's the Voting Rights Act, if it's maternal health care, whatever it is that impacts our community uniquely or disproportionately, we're going to keep bringing them up until we get these things passed.''\n\nIt's the third time Watson Coleman has introduced the Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair or the CROWN Act, which prohibits discrimination in the workplace and schools based on hairstyles, such as cornrows and locs, often associated with racial groups. There are no House GOP sponsors. Cory Booker, a fellow Democrat from New Jersey, is a co-sponsor in the Senate. Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine is the lone GOP supporter.\n\nWatson Coleman said it would be dishonest to say she expects this Congress to pass the bill.\n\n\"We've seen the Trump administration and the Trump Congress do all they can do through EOs (executive orders) proposals, policies and legislation to diminish the rights of individuals, particularly those of color and those most vulnerable,'' she said.\n\nTrump signed an executive order in January to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives across federal agencies. The administration has pushed businesses to do the same. Supporters said race or ethnicity should not be factors in hiring or promoting workers.\n\nCritics of the anti-diversity campaign said the goal is to provide fair opportunities for everyone.\n\nHere's what some recent Democratic bills would do to restore protections and expand opportunities for women and people of color:\n\n\"We are in a cost of living crisis,\" DeLauro said in a text, adding that she plans to continue pushing measures that help middle class, working class and vulnerable Americans.\n\nDeLauro noted that one Republican has signed on, but she's working to get more GOP support to pass the bill.\n\nWatson Coleman said it matters that communities see that Democrats \"keep fighting even in the midst of very daunting and disappointing and disruptive times, that we're not going to fade into the woodwork.\"\n\nFor some Democratic lawmakers, introducing measures, even if only symbolic, is a chance to show constituents they're working on issues important to them, said Jason Williams, professor of Justice Studies at Montclair State University in New Jersey.\n\n\"They get to show their base that they're still fighting,\" Williams said. \"The base feels as if the Democrats have been really just sitting there and just allowing Trump and this administration to do whatever it wants to do and at the same time not even holding their own congressional colleagues accountable.\"\n\nIt's also important for Democrats to get Republicans on the record voting against priorities, such as Social Security, so they can use it against them, he said. \"It gives them more ammo,\" Williams said.\n\nIntroducing legislation is also a chance for Democrats to highlight their priorities, said Adolphus Belk Jr., a professor of political science and African American studies at Winthrop University in South Carolina.\n\nSome measures, Belk said, may be a part their campaign strategy for midterm elections.\n\n\"It gives you something that you can run on and something you can work on if elected,\" he said. \"You do stuff now because you're in session and you make your play.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Democratic leaders stood with Sewell at a press conference in the U.S. Capitol as she again touted the importance of a federal bill protecting voting rights.\n\n\"We know that we're fighting an uphill battle, but what we know is that we can't give up,\" she said. \"We can be mad, we can be upset, but we have to stay determined. If there's anything that John Lewis and those foot soldiers taught us, taking a page from their playbook, is we have to be resolute.\"\n\nContributing Sarah Wire"

I guess he missed the debacle that passed for Democratic congressional strategy last week over the government shutdown.

Chuck Schumer, the party's minority leader in the Senate, has become the face of it all.\n\nSchumer pulled an infuriating two-step last week on a continuing resolution to fund the government until Sept. 30. House Republicans, with the majority, gave Democrats in that chamber no input on the resolution. So they forced Republicans to pass it on their own in the House.\n\nSchumer said he would also vote no when it got to the Senate, but then flipped and surrendered to Republicans , giving them everything they wanted in a very public win. Democrats in the House and Senate, and beyond, were outraged.\n\nHow's that playing for Schumer?\n\nCongress is in recess this week and he had a book tour set with stops in Baltimore, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. But angry protests loomed. So Schumer postponed the book tour \" due to security concerns .\"\n\nThe DNC has its own road show in the works. I'm betting that won't go the way the party plans.\n\nThe Democrats are hoping to capitalize on anger brewing around the country, where some Republican members of Congress have decided against holding in-person town hall meetings , and others have held events where furious constituents railed at them for Trump's efforts to slash and burn the services and jobs they rely on.\n\nThe DNC is hosting town halls in Republican-held competitive House districts in states like Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska and Pennsylvania \"where vulnerable GOP House members are running scared from their constituents,\" the party said in a news release, adding that it hopes to \"engage voters who have been left behind by Donald Trump and the Republicans' dangerous agenda .\"\n\nHere's some engagement: If those voters are raging about Trump's actions and Republicans in Congress doing nothing to exert their constitutional power in our government, why would they feel anything but contempt for Democrats in Congress who can't put up a fight?\n\nThe blowback for Democrats is real, and it looks to be metastasizing.\n\nA CNN/SSRS poll released Sunday showed that 54% of Americans had an unfavorable opinion of the Democratic Party, while 29% had a favorable view, 16% had no opinion and 1% had not even heard of it.\n\nAnd that poll of 1,206 adults was conducted from March 6 to March 9, before last week's debacle over the shutdown. So don't look for those numbers to get better any time soon.\n\nSunday's CNN survey showed the favorability at an all-time low for the Democrats since 1992.\n\nAn NBC News Poll released Sunday found the same thing, with just 27% of registered voters holding a favorable view of the party, the lowest rating that poll has found going back to 1990.\n\nThat survey was conducted from March 7 to March 11 , before the latest bad news for the Democratic Party.\n\nWhen the polling shows a quarter to a third of Americans don't like what you're selling, it's time to rethink what you're selling.\n\nAnd this must confound Democrats ‒ the same NBC News Poll showed 51% disapprove of Trump's actions as president while 47% approve . That means a majority of Americans are on their side. But 47% is the highest approval rating Trump has ever received as president.\n\nThe Democratic Party looks like it's going to have to fight itself before it can fight Trump and his Republican allies.\n\nU.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, the independent from Vermont who caucuses with Democrats, has gone on tour to rail against American oligarchs taking over and dismantling our government. He's being joined by U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , the progressive New York Democrat who drives Trump allies crazy.\n\nWhile they rally the base, the party's likely 2028 presidential nominee contenders are clearly moving toward the political center to avoid the pitfalls that doomed former Vice President Kamala Harris' presidential campaign last year.\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, in his first term but absolutely expected to run for president in 2028, made his populist pitch on HBO's \"Real Time with Bill Maher\" on Friday, knocking Schumer for his lack of leverage with Republicans in the continuing resolution controversy.\n\nA likely Shapiro competitor, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, has made time in his schedule running America's most populous state to code-switch from his progressive politics to a podcast heavy with Team Trump propagandists.\n\nSo voters have two choices in America right now: a Republican Party that does anything Trump wants ‒ the Constitution and rule of law be damned ‒ or a Democratic Party lacking in any apparent strategy to resist it.\n\nNo DNC survey is going to fix that. No town hall meeting will resolve it, either, if the party can't map a route back to a place of effective opposition.\n\nFollow USA TODAY columnist Chris Brennan on X, formerly known as Twitter: @ByChrisBrennan"

The seat was previously held by state Rep. Matthew Gergely, another Democrat, who died in January. Goughnour's win restores his party's 102-101 majority in the state House.\n\nAlso on the ballot Tuesday - and giving national Democrats cause for celebration - was a special state Senate election to replace Republican state Sen. Ryan Aument, who resigned to work for U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick.\n\nThe district in northwest Lancaster went for President Donald Trump by 15 points in 2024. Democrat James Malone claimed victory by less than 500 votes.\n\nWhile Malone's win does not affect control of the state Senate - Republicans will still have a four-seat majority - it is being hailed by Democrats outside of the Keystone State as a good sign for them.\n\n\"We feel great, and the Republicans are scared,\" Democratic National Committee chair Ken Martin told USA TODAY.\n\nA spokesperson for the Republican State Leadership Committee said in a statement they are not sweating the outcome.\n\n\"Democrats know their failed policy agenda is toxic and their only chance to boost enthusiasm with their voters is to throw everything they can at minor, low-information special elections that don't reflect the realities they will face in the midterms,\" Mason Di Palma, RSLC Communications Director said.\n\n\"Republicans still maintain a comfortable cushion in the Pennsylvania Senate to be a check on Governor Shapiro's dangerous liberal agenda,\" he added, \"but last night's result shows beating them and beating Democrats back in 2025 and 2026 will take significant resources.\"\n\nDemocrats have been celebrating a handful of special election wins already in 2025, including flipping an Iowa state Senate seat in January.

Only 7% of survey respondents said they said they have a \"very positive\" view of the party.\n\nAnother poll released by CNN similarly found 29% of voters view Democrats in a positive light, a low in CNN's polling since 1992. Among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, 63% said they have a favorable view of the party.\n\nIntra-party rifts and frustration consumed Democrats in Congress last week, as lawmakers raced to avert a government shutdown .\n\nAfter the House passed a GOP-led plan to keep the government's doors open, Senate Democrats were left to decide between backing legislation that would empower President Donald Trump or allowing a shutdown that would have forced hundreds of thousands of workers to go unpaid.\n\nUltimately, ten Democrats in the Senate sided with most of their Republican colleagues to pass the spending deal and avoid a shutdown.\n\nThe small cohort included Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer , who announced on Thursday his intent to vote \"yes\" and faced a flood of criticism from fellow Democrats over the decision. Some have even called into question if he should step down from leadership.\n\nHowever, with Republicans controlling the Senate, White House and House, some Democratic lawmakers want their fellow leaders to simply stick together. For example, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., who voted against the spending legislation last week, called for an end to Democrats' \"intramural quarreling\" on Sunday.\n\n\"We're in a fight for our democracy right now, and if we're having a fight in our dugout, we're not out on the field and the other team is scoring runs,\" Whitehouse told ABC.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., another \"no\" vote, said he understands why some of his colleagues were moved to avoid a painful shutdown . However, in an interview with NBC's Kristen Welker, he pointed to risk aversion as a potential cause for his party's low polling.\n\n\"I understand that had we gone into a shutdown, even for a handful of days, it would have been difficult,\" Murphy said Sunday. \"But it would have sent a message that the Democratic Party is not going to be bullied by Donald Trump .\"\n\n\"I think Democrats in this country, but I think the broad middle of the public as well,\" he added, \"want to see our party fighting in exceptional ways.\"\n\nIn the CNN poll, 57% of Democrats and Democratic-aligned independents said they believe party leaders should focus on stopping the GOP agenda, compared to 42% who said they want to see Democrats work with their Republican colleagues.\n\nNBC found that, among self-identified Democratic voters, 65% said they want their party to \"stick to their positions even if this means not getting things done in Washington.\" Thirty-two percent said they want Democrats to \"make compromises with President Trump to gain consensus on legislation.\"\n\nThe NBC poll surveyed 1,000 registered voters in the U.S. from March 7-11. The margin of error is +/- 3.1 percentage points. The CNN poll surveyed 1,206 adults in the U.S. from March 6-9. It has a margn of error of +/- 3.3 percentage points."

John Fetterman recently observed the following about the state of his Democratic Party: \"A sad cavalcade of self owns and unhinged petulance. It only makes Trump look more presidential and restrained. We're becoming the metaphorical car alarms that nobody pays attention to - and it may not be the winning message.\"\n\nOuch.\n\nFetterman posted that message on social media after Democrats' embarrassing show of \"resistance\" during President Donald Trump 's joint address to Congress this month.\n\nIt's a stinging rebuke to make about one's own party, but Fetterman is absolutely right. Democrats have struggled to move forward as a unified party with a unified vision ever since Trump's win in November.\n\nAmericans have noticed Democrats' lack of unity and a coherent party platform. Two polls released over the weekend carry a major warning for Democrats - if they choose to listen.\n\nA poll from NBC News found that only 27% of registered voters view the Democratic Party favorably , which is the lowest rating for Democrats in the history of NBC polling (going back to 1990). Among self-identified Democrats, only 59% view the party positively.\n\nOf note is the drastic split between the 7% of all voters who have a \"very positive\" view of the party and the 38% who have a \"very negative\" view .\n\nIn contrast, Republicans' \"very positive\" rating of 21% is the highest it's been in at least 15 years.\n\nAnd Trump hit a new record with favorability, with 36% seeing him in a \"very positive\" light. (It's true that 45% have a \"very negative\" view of Trump, but it's been worse.)\n\nA CNN poll offered similar bad news to Democrats, with only 29% of U.S. adults viewing them in a positive light - the lowest figure since 1992. It's also a 20-point drop since 2021.\n\nMuch of the Democratic infighting centers on differences in how the party should respond to Trump and Republicans' slim control in Congress.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer garnered the anger of many Democrats when he opted, somewhat reluctantly, to vote last week with Republicans to allow a bill to avert a government shutdown to proceed to a vote.\n\nNew York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is one of the Democrats who have openly bashed Schumer , also of New York, for his choice. The progressive champion and a rising leader for the far left called it a \"tremendous mistake\" and a \"huge slap in the face.\"\n\nBut Schumer didn't want Democrats to own a shutdown if they prevented the bill from getting to Trump.\n\nNow, the backlash is such that Schumer has had to postpone a book tour . Democratic activists have been staging protests outside his home, and reportedly had organized similar protests at scheduled book tour locations.\n\nThat doesn't bode well for party unity.\n\nWhile Democrats like AOC aren't likely to back down on anything, other party members like Fetterman realize that Democrats have real soul-searching to do ahead of next year's midterm elections.\n\nThat seems to be what California Gov. Gavin Newsom is doing. As the progressive governor of the country's most progressive state , he's looking to moderate on the cultural issues that have caused Democrats to flounder. In a recent interview with a conservative activist, Newsom admitted that \"men in female sports\" is \"deeply unfair.\"\n\nNow, I don't believe that Newsom has actually changed his views, but it's still encouraging to see a politician moderate his public stance on something .\n\nIn the meantime, given their record-low approval ratings, Democrats need to first figure out how to get along among themselves.\n\nIngrid Jacques is a columnist at USA TODAY.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., are taking the Trump rebellion show on the road - and giving Democrats a masterclass on how to organize ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nSince last Thursday, Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez have been traveling the country on the \" Fighting Oligarchy Tour ,\" riling up crowds and keeping the momentum up to fight against President Donald Trump and MAGA Republicans. On Friday, they spoke to a crowd of approximately 34,000 people in Denver, championing health care and labor rights while condemning economic inequality and the billionaire class.\n\n\"If we stand together, don't let them divide us up, if we are smart, if we're willing to go outside of our comfort zones, there is nothing ‒ nothing ‒ that can stop us,\" Sanders told the crowd .\n\nDemocratic leaders should take note (I'm looking at you, Sen. Chuck Schumer ). This is a great first step in rebuilding the party after a brutal election year and the beginning of Trump's kinglike takeover of the United States. If Democrats can harness this energy, they could create a stronger resistance movement than previous iterations.\n\nOf course, the Republican Party immediately tried to downplay the success of the rally by doubting its size and alleging that attendees weren't there because they wanted to be.\n\n\"The Dems just move around the same group of paid 'protesters,' \" Elon Musk said on X.\n\nThere is no evidence that this is the case.\n\nRepublicans will also dismiss AOC and Sanders as being \"out of touch\" with what Americans want. These are likely the same Republicans who now embrace MAGA, which used to be the fringe of the Republican Party and now has a stranglehold on it. Like it or not, Republicans have won two of the previous three presidential elections by wielding increasingly extreme politics, not governing from the center.\n\nAre Republicans so deluded that they can't imagine people would actually be angry enough about what Trump and Musk are doing to go to these events? After all, they've been facing angry voters at town halls nationwide . Why is it so surprising that a former presidential candidate and one of the most popular representatives in Congress would draw crowds this large? It seems to me that the GOP doesn't want to admit that the country is more divided than it claims.\n\nOr maybe they know that Democrats will keep losing if they keep listening to politicians like Schumer?\n\nDemocrats would be wise to learn from the Republican shift to the far right and any increasing dissatisfaction with the inability of leaders on the left to adjust.\n\nThe Democratic Party is at a crossroads. The party's favorability rating is at 29% - a record low - in new polling from CNN.\n\nThe majority of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents also said that the party should be focused on working to stop the Republican agenda, as opposed to working with the GOP to get some legislation passed.\n\nThe era of American politics being about finding a middle ground is over. Someone better tell the party's elite that this is the case. Between Schumer voting to avoid a government shutdown and California Gov. Gavin Newsom platforming bigots on his podcast , it's clear that some people haven't gotten this memo.\n\nI want to see the Democratic Party do better. I want Democrats to be bold in their policy agenda; I want them to do everything they can to stop Trump. Clearly, the message Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders are sharing resonates with voters.\n\nDemocrats must widen their tent and accept more progressive views of what the party could be, as opposed to doing the same thing repeatedly and expecting different results.\n\nFollow USA TODAY columnist Sara Pequeño on X, formerly Twitter: @sara__pequeno"

His victory restores the 102-101 seat majority Democrats held in the House before Gergley died in January after suffering a medical emergency.\n\nA Democratic victory in the Lancaster County race would not change Republican control of the Senate, but would be a significant upset in the district, where President Donald Trump won by 15 percentage points in November.\n\nUnofficial results in the 36th Senate District election showed East Petersburg Mayor James Malone, a Democrat, ahead of Republican County Commissioner Chairman Joshua Parsons by fewer than 500 votes, or 0.89% of the 54,000 votes cast.\n\nThe Associated Press said the race was too early to call, with an unknown number of provisional ballots still to be counted.

(AP) - Democrats, with few electoral outlets for their outrage at President Donald Trump's dramatic restructuring of the federal government, are pouring millions of dollars into two special elections in Florida.\n\nThat's where Democratic candidates are trying to accomplish the improbable by flipping a pair of Trump-friendly congressional seats and carving into Republicans' narrow 218 to 213 majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. While Democratic leaders aren't predicting outright wins in such Republican-leaning districts, they say they think they'll exceed expectations. And they sound especially hopeful about the 6th Congressional District, where a public school teacher has out raised a Trump-endorsed state senator by a nearly 10-to-1 margin in the race to replace Mike Waltz, who was tapped by Trump to be a national security adviser in what was widely seen as a move without much political risk.\n\nDemocrats' challenge in both districts is formidable, but the money has been pouring in.\n\n\"The floodgates have really opened,\" said Aubrey Jewett, a political scientist at the University of Central Florida. \"It's like, wow.\"\n\nRepublicans, including Trump, have noticed too, and are looking to head off an embarrassing outcome. The president joined both Republican candidates by telephone on separate tele-town halls Thursday to help get out the vote in the \"all-important\" elections.\n\nWinning both races next Tuesday would be colossal for a Democratic Party that has struggled to settle on a way to push back during the early days of the second Trump administration. Winning either - or even narrowing the margin in districts the president won by more than 30 points less than five months ago - could help alleviate the panic that set in among party leaders after Republicans swept both houses of Congress and the presidency in November.\n\nAn early test in Republican territory\n\nNational Democrats point to the fundraising hauls in some of the most conservative parts of Florida as a sign that voters are already fed up with the president's aggressive second term , a message they're hoping to parlay into grassroots support - and more money - ahead of the 2026 midterms.\n\nVoters in Florida's 1st and 6th Congressional Districts will be among the first to put the new administration to an electoral test in the April 1 special elections to fill seats once held by former Reps. Matt Gaetz and Waltz , who were both tapped to join the Trump administration.\n\nGaetz withdrew from consideration to be attorney general amid allegations of sexual misconduct , which he has denied . Waltz currently finds himself at the center of controversy over the texting of sensitive military plans for an attack on Houthis in Yemen to a group that included a journalist.\n\nDemocrats Gay Valimont in the 1st District and Josh Weil in the 6th District have both far outraised and outspent their Trump-backed Republican competitors, in districts the president won by 30 points or more in 2024.\n\nFlorida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis, who's running in the 1st District, and state Sen. Randy Fine in the 6th District have both campaigned as staunch allies of the president, who endorsed them in the primary .\n\nBut with donations for the Democrats flooding in from all 50 states, Republicans are funneling resources into the races in the hopes the GOP won't \"get embarrassed\" Tuesday by a better-than-expected showing by Democrats.\n\n\"I want it to be a landslide,\" said Doug Stauffer, chair of the GOP in Okaloosa County, which is part of the 1st District. \"And if it's not, then we haven't done the right thing for the constituents.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries is already pushing the message that if Democrats overperform in the districts, resistance to Trump's second term could help them take back the House in 2026.\n\n\"These are races that should not under ordinary circumstances be on anyone's political radar. They are safe Republican seats that Donald Trump won by more than 30 points,\" Jeffries told reporters this week. \"The American people are not buying what the Republicans are selling. That is why they are on the run.\"\n\nIn the 6th District, which extends north of Orlando, Florida, Weil has pulled in an eye-popping $9 million, according to the most recent campaign finance reports. That's nearly 10 times the fundraising reported by Fine, a self-described \"conservative firebrand\" and former gambling industry executive known for his anti-LGBTQ stances and combative approach to politics.\n\nIn recent days, Fine has come under pressure from Republican leaders to raise more money, and has ponied up $600,000 of his own fortune for his campaign, he told The Associated Press. Plus, outside groups are spending more than $2 million to help Fine, according to data from AdImpact, narrowing the fundraising gap.\n\nNorth Carolina Rep. Richard Hudson, chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee, acknowledged that Fine should have stepped up his fundraising earlier, but said he'll be a strong member of Congress.\n\n\"I'm not concerned about margins,\" Hudson said. \"I mean, special elections are special.\"\n\nA call for help from a surprising source\n\nAccording to an email shared with the AP, even people in Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' orbit are working to gin up support for Fine - a notable development because of the venom the two Sunshine State Republicans hold for each other, after Fine publicly turned on DeSantis to endorse Trump during the 2024 presidential primary.\n\nIn a message to voters this week, a DeSantis staffer urged \"grassroots warriors\" to knock on doors and make phone calls in the 6th District, saying the race \"is at a critical crossroads\" and \"the stakes couldn't be higher.\"\n\nBryan Piligra, a spokesperson for the Fine campaign, said they appreciate the help.\n\n\"The only thing that matters is making sure Republicans are united to defeat radical Democrats like Josh Weil who will stop at nothing to destroy President Trump,\" Piligra said in a statement.\n\nWeil, in a statement of his own, said the \"tides are turning\" on the GOP as Trump pushes to fire federal workers and dismantle federal agencies .\n\nWeil said he's grateful to those \"who have invested in my campaign and made this a truly grassroots effort. It's because of them that we have Republicans scrambling.\"\n\nStill, the chair of the Republican Party of Florida, Evan Power, said he's confident the Republican candidates will win their races because \"we have the ground game.\" But he acknowledged that turnout tends to fall significantly during special elections, which could cut into the GOP's margin of victory.\n\n\"Republicans haven't done as great in special elections as they do in general elections,\" Power said.\n\nSome observers say the national attention being paid to Democrats in safe Republican districts is itself a victory for the minority party. But Jewett, the political scientist, said it would take a \"miracle\" for Democrats to win either seat.\n\n\"Money is important in elections,\" Jewett said. \"But it can only - usually - it can only take you so far.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Leah Askarinam in Washington and Stephany Matat in West Palm Beach, Florida, contributed to this report.

They have offered little organized resistance to the Trump agenda that is reshaping the federal government.\n\nPennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman , who believes the party needs to change its approach when reacting to Trump's aggressive agenda, said that if the party doesn't get its \"s*** together\" soon, Democrats risk becoming \"in a permanent minority.\"\n\n\"We really got our a**** kicked in, and especially in the Senate, we could have been left a gigantic, smoking hole in the ground,\" Fetterman told Politico . \"We could have easily lost Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin, and we could be staring down, 56-44.\"\n\nOthers expressed frustration that no lessons appear to have been learned from the 2024 presidential election and the issues that appealed to voters.\n\n\"In the wake of the election, I kept asking people what the campaign could have done better. And the answer was a whole lot of nothing,\" Pennsylvania-based strategist Tommy McDonald told Politico . \"I'm not sure folks are open to learning any lessons.\"\n\nThere is a belief among some in the party that they will take back the House in the 2026 midterms , which Rep. Seth Moulton said was a \"dangerous assumption.\" Moulton publicly questioned allowing transgender athletes to compete in girls' sports following the 2024 election defeat. The Trump campaign repeatedly attacked Harris and the Democrats over the heated issue.\n\n\"I think it would be a massive mistake not to come out of this election and make changes,\" Moulton said. \"Everyone said we would win the House this year. Now people are saying, 'Oh, well, we'll surely win the House in the midterms.' That's a very dangerous assumption when we lost across the board.\"\n\nFormer House Speaker Kevin McCathy recently said that Trump has broken the Democratic party. \"It is a huge mess,\" said the former speaker, The Hill reported. \"If you think about it, they are leaderless. There's no message, and their polling continues to drop. They are now fighting among themselves...It wasn't just that President Trump won the election. He has now broken the Democratic Party.\"\n\nThe former speaker warned that the two minority leaders - Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer - would not remain in their posts at the current rate. The two men, he argued, had little to no control over their own caucuses and were not making themselves known to the American people.\n\nMcCarthy insisted the real figures of leadership in the party were Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders , who embarked on a nationwide tour last week to rally disaffected Democrats in the wake of Trump's inauguration.\n\nAdditional reporting by John Bowden"

Others should do the same | Opinion\n\nManage your account\n\nHaving an account on Elon Musk's social media platform X perpetuates an acceptance of tyranny as a feature of our society.\n\nMusk, much like his boss, President Donald Trump, catered to conservatives' irrational fear that they were being left behind in the social media space. Musk bought X, previously known as Twitter. And Trump started his own platform, Truth Social.\n\nAccording to data from Similarweb, a third-party company that tracks social media analytics, more than 115,000 users deactivated their X accounts the day after the election.\n\nOpinion\n\nSome of California's leading Democrats finally came to their senses. On Thursday Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas and Assembly Majority Leader Cecilia Aguiar-Curry announced 58 of the caucus' 60 members are no longer using the social media platform.\n\n\"There are real risks with relying on a private company, owned by Elon Musk, as a channel for communications,\" Rivas said about leaving the social media platform. \"Democracy depends on impartial information, not the shifting whims of one billionaire. Hate speech is everywhere on X, the company has no accountability, and the flood of misinformation from fake accounts is just that - fake. I don't think taxpayer resources should go to X.\"\n\nFrankly, they should've left a long time ago. I deleted my X account the day after the election, after I realized how wrong it is to be on a platform controlled by a zealous billionaire.\n\nX lost its way a long time ago when it changed its verification process from a legitimate way to protect someone's identity to a paid subscription that opened the floodgates for every weird uncle with their F-150 as a profile picture to say the most unhinged things.\n\nX, regardless of who owns it, isn't the epicenter of society as one might think. DataReportal's Digital 2025: Global Overview Report shows X is the ninth most used social media platform globally and the eighth most popular social platform for users ages 18-and-over. It also has only 104 million users in the United States, compared to YouTube with 253 million and Instgrame with 172 million.\n\nMusk's intentions were never to make X a space for variety of thought. He uses it now as a weapon, from calling a U.S. Senator a \"traitor\" to virtually campaigning against anyone or anything he opposes.\n\nThe Sacramento Bee's opinion team is hard at work sifting through the chaos so you don't have to. Get our weekly Bee Opinionated newsletter straight to your inbox and we'll help you cut through the drone of the news cycle.\n\nShortly after it was announced that the Dems ditched X, Assembly Republicans announced that they were joining an alternate platform, Bluesky, because they're not afraid of listening to different opinions. Or so they say.\n\n\"Democrats can run, but they can't hide from being called out for their out-of-touch agenda that's made California less safe and less affordable,\" Assembly Minority Leader James Gallagher (R-East Nicolaus) said. \"Republicans are willing to listen to voices from across the political spectrum and don't need a safe space to get away from opinions we don't like.\"\n\nThe archaic nature of X is not a shining example of how people should express their opinions and ideas.\n\nConservatives got what they wanted in X, a haven for hate to be spread and misinformation to be amplified. Now that California Democrats are leaving, or at least eliminating their official accounts, Republicans wanna say it's because they don't want to listen to other people. Give me a break.\n\nOur democracy depends on Americans ability to speak to one another about their differences and similarities."

Malone previously served as the mayor of East Petersburg and will succeed Republican Senator Ryan Aument, who resigned from the office in December to serve as a state director for Senator Dave McCormick.\n\n\"I'm very excited and really, really happy that all the work we put in has paid off,\" Malone told WGAL-TV .\n\n\"Everyday voters are not liking what they're seeing at the federal level; they don't like the chaos.

Kindness over criticism, right? So that's what we're trying to do, and I think that that really is what we're looking at, moving forward.\"\n\nMalone's victory followed another Democratic win Tuesday in the Keystone State, after Dan Goughnour won a House seat, maintaining a Democratic stronghold in Pennsylvania's lower chamber.\n\nThe wins were roundly celebrated by the larger Democratic Party, which saw its voters excoriate their inaction on a GOP budget resolution that promised whopping Medicaid cuts at the national level last week.\n\nRepresentative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez saluted Malone's strategy, urging the party to refocus on winning critical local elections, \"from school board to councils to state legislatures.\"\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, felt the sting.\n\n\"Damn,\" posted Elon Musk, reacting to a screenshot of the election results.\n\nBut Malone had a quick reply.\n\n\"I'll take this as a compliment, because Elon Musk knows I'm about to get to work for the everyday people of Pennsylvania, not him and his billionaire friends,\" he wrote Wednesday morning."

      "text": "Democrats Say DOGE Will Lead To Social Security Benefit Cuts, Privatization\n\nManage your account\n\nWASHINGTON - A key part of President Donald Trump's victories in 2016 and 2024 was his ability to move the Republican Party away from its longstanding belief the United States needs to cut spending on Social Security and Medicare. It was a promise he made again and again in both races.\n\nDemocrats have a new goal: To convince voters it was all a lie. The party's top member on the Senate committee overseeing Social Security warned this week that Trump secretly wants to end Social Security as we know it.\n\nSen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said the Wall Street executive Trump tapped to head the Social Security Administration, Frank Bisignano, made a business career out of taking over troubled businesses, firing the workers and selling off what's left.\n\n\"That résumé and approach ought to concern Americans if somebody is thinking about applying that pattern to Social Security,\" Wyden said. \"As I've been saying for weeks now, this approach is a prelude to privatizing Social Security and handing it over to private equity.\"\n\nThough Trump has insisted he doesn't want to touch Social Security, this year he and his billionaire adviser Elon Musk have falsely claimed millions of dead people receive Social Security benefits while ordering cutbacks at the Social Security Administration, including potentially disruptive phone service changes, in the name of fighting fraud. Their words and actions have prompted Democrats to say the ultimate goal is privatization.\n\n\"Why are Donald Trump and Elon Musk doing this? Because the goal of Trump and Musk is to destroy Social Security from within and make it so unworkable, so inefficient, that Donald Trump has a pretext to cut benefits and privatize the program,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Wednesday on the Senate floor.\n\nPrivatizing Social Security, such as by giving recipients the option to invest their payroll contributions in the stock market, is an unpopular idea last championed by President George W. Bush in 2005, prompting an electoral backlash that led to one of the best midterms in the history of the Democratic Party.\n\nDemocrats are clearly fond of the memory.\n\n\"We won the House,\" Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.) told HuffPost this week.\n\nAsked if he thought it was more important to highlight the remote threat of privatization rather than simply pointing out the Trump administration is laying off frontline staff and disallowing claimants from verifying their identities over the phone, Neal said, \"That's exactly right.\"\n\n\"I think that what they say with fraud is, 'Well, here's the plan: If we keep suggesting that there's a lot of fraud, then, if we cut contact with the Social Security Administration, then we can prove that it doesn't work,\" Neal said.\n\nDemocratic polling has found voters are extremely worried about Musk's involvement with Social Security in particular, as the billionaire has referred to the program as a \"Ponzi scheme\" ― that is, a full-blown scam ― and suggested cuts are warranted.\n\nWhen Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) asked Bisignano if he favored privatizing the retirement program, Bisignano said he did not.\n\n\"I've never thought about privatizing,\" Bisignano said. \"It's not a word that anybody's ever talked to me about. And I don't see this institution as anything other than a government agency that gets run for the benefit of the American public.\"\n\nStill, the changes already underway at Social Security could have a significant impact on beneficiaries. At the urging of Musk's Department of Government Efficiency initiative, the agency has consolidated internal offices, fired staff and announced claimants will no longer be allowed to verify their identities over the phone, potentially requiring millions of additional visits to field offices each year. At the same time, DOGE has targeted field offices for closure.\n\nO n top of all that, DOGE affiliates improperly gained access to the agency's sensitive data, at least until they were told to butt out last week by a federal court.\n\nEven bureaucratic operations have taken on a seemingly political tone. The Social Security Administration's acting commissioner, Leland Dudek, canceled vital records contracts with the state of Maine after the governor feuded with President Trump over allowing transgender athletes in girls' sports. And Dudek threatened to shut down the agency altogether in response to the court order last week, relenting only when the judge sent a letter telling him not to do it.\n\nWyden said the administration's moves are a prelude to privatization, at least for the administration of the program if not for actually diverting payroll taxes into 401(k)-style accounts that invest in the stock market.\n\n\"They're trying to hollow out as much of the structure of Social Security today, the offices, the phones, the personnel, as they possibly can,\" Wyden told HuffPost. \"Then you see the system trying to cope with it. And people go, 'Oh my goodness, we have all these problems now. We better get some private contractors in, or we won't be able to get the checks out.'\"\n\nSome Republicans have complained about the attacks on Social Security - especially when it comes to closing field offices in their districts - but most have not. And they all say Trump will keep his word when it comes to not cutting Social Security.\n\n\"The attack all day has been on DOGE and undercutting Social Security and shutting it down or privatizing it or whatever it is,\" Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) said at Bisignano's hearing. \"The bottom line is the president of the United States has said very clearly that we are not going to cut Social Security benefits.\""

      "text": "'Something stinks': Elon Musk, congressional Republicans target Democrats' main fundraising machine\n\nManage your account\n\nActBlue, a fundraising juggernaut for liberal candidates and causes, is facing stepped-up scrutiny and criticism from Republicans on Capitol Hill and allies of President Donald Trump - as the GOP flexes its new power in Washington and targets one of the key pillars of the Democratic Party's financial infrastructure.\n\nThree Republicans in Congress - including the chairmen of the House Oversight and Administration panels - are urging Trump's Treasury Department to share with lawmakers reports of suspicious financial transactions related to ActBlue. Other GOP lawmakers are demanding probes by Treasury and the FBI into whether the fundraising platform has helped organizations engaged in terrorism or violated federal campaign finance laws.\n\nAnd billionaire Trump donor Elon Musk - who is overseeing the administration's controversial effort to rapidly shrink the federal government - has criticized ActBlue, seeking to tie it to protests and acts of vandalism against his electric-vehicle company Tesla. He has argued, without evidence to substantiate his claims, that some prominent Democrats - including one who died in 2019 - were funding ActBlue and the protests.\n\n\"Something stinks about ActBlue,\" Musk posted earlier this month on his social media platform, X.\n\nOfficials with ActBlue deny any wrongdoing.\n\n\"ActBlue has always dealt with attacks and baseless claims from the Right that are designed to undermine the power of the small-dollar donors who rely on our platform,\" spokesperson Megan Hughes said in a statement in CNN. \"This new, coordinated attack is different only in scale, and our team remains steadfast in defending against these bad-faith attacks.\"\n\nShe said the platform would continue its \"mission to expand access to political giving and ensure people-powered movements continue to thrive.\"\n\nActBlue, a nonprofit organization, is a fundraising powerhouse for Democrats and progressive groups - helping to funnel small-dollar donations to candidates, party committees and others. In all, it has collected more than $16 billion since its founding in 2004, according to a running tally on its website.\n\nAlthough it has competitors, it has long dominated processing payments online for the party. According to the platform, more than 14 million users have saved their contact and payment information with the group, allowing contributors to easily make one-click donations.\n\nBut the ramped-up criticism from Republicans comes as ActBlue has faced internal tumult - including the recent departure of several high-level staffers as first reported by The New York Times - and criticism from some Democratic consultants and others in liberal circles over whether the platform is doing enough to protect donors from deceptive tactics.\n\nLast December, for instance, dozens of individuals and progressive groups signed an open letter to ActBlue, urging reforms - including prohibiting political committees that raise money on the platform from using misleading language in fundraising solicitations.\n\nBut some Democrats worry that - with Republicans now controlling all the levers of government in Washington - the increased scrutiny could serve as a precursor to a Republican attempt to shut down the platform entirely and undermine Democratic fundraising in future elections.\n\nJosh Nelson, the CEO of the ad platform Civic Shout and one of the signatories of last year's letter recommending changes to ActBlue's policies, said his concerns about its internal practices have taken a back seat this year to his growing alarm over what he views as \"illegitimate attacks\" from the GOP.\n\n\"I think Republicans know that ActBlue has been an extremely effective fundraising platform for thousands of Democratic campaigns and progressive groups,\" Nelson said. \"They're just trying to use power to harm their political opponents in future elections.\"\n\n\"The question is how far will Republicans go?\"\n\nGOP lawmakers in recent years have increased their scrutiny of ActBlue, questioning how it guards against fraud and prevents foreigners from illegally contributing to US campaigns. Among the issues raised: ActBlue did not always require donors to add the CVV number - or card verification value - on every credit card transaction.\n\n(ActBlue has added the CVV requirement but has said it has long used several reliable means to prevent fraud and prohibit illicit foreign contributions, including an address verification system to ensure cardholder addresses match those at the banks that issued the cards. Americans living abroad, for instance, also must include a copy of their passport photo.)\n\nBut this month has seen a slew of fresh ActBlue activity from GOP lawmakers, who are seeking executive branch probes or access to sensitive documents from Treasury, such as the \"suspicious activity reports\" or SARs, which financial institutions file with the agency to flag suspected cases of money laundering, fraud or other suspicious transactions.\n\nWisconsin GOP Rep. Bryan Steil, who oversees the House Administration Committee, and others have complained that the Biden administration provided only limited information in response to requests for the reports involving ActBlue.\n\nHe recently joined House Oversight and Accountability Committee chairman, Kentucky Rep. James Comer, and New York Rep. Nick Langworthy in a letter that seeks all suspicious activity reports mentioning ActBlue filed at any point from January 1, 2023.\n\nIt's not clear whether Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will cooperate.\n\nCurrently, the House Administration Committee \"is in communication with the Treasury Department about reviewing SARs,\" a source familiar told CNN this week. A Treasury spokesperson did not comment.\n\nOther GOP lawmakers pushing for probes of the fundraising platform include Trump allies, California Rep. Darrell Issa and Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs.\n\nIn the meantime, Democrats are trying to use the GOP scrutiny to bring in more political contributions.\n\n\"Republicans are attacking ActBlue because small-dollar donations from people like you are a major advantage for Democratic campaigns up-and-down the ballot,\" read a recent fundraising email from the Democratic National Committee.\n\nThe appeal then links users to ActBlue to help Democrats \"fight back.\"\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com"

      "text": "We Dug Into the Polls. Democrats in Congress Should Be Very Afraid.\n\nManage your account\n\nAs Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer knows better than anyone, the Democratic base is pissed off. And not just a little.\n\nThe intensity of the anger roiling the party is at a historic level, suggesting a breach between congressional Democrats and the party grassroots so severe that it could reshape the 2026 primary election season.\n\nCongressional Democrats have typically enjoyed higher popularity with their voting base than their Republican counterparts. But the trauma of the 2024 presidential election defeat appears to have ruptured that relationship. A review of Quinnipiac University's annual first-quarter congressional polling reveals that, for the first time in the poll's history, congressional Democrats are now underwater with their own voters in approval ratings.\n\nJust 40 percent of Democrats approve of the job performance of congressional Democrats, compared to 49 percent who disapprove. That's a dramatic change from this time last year, when 75 percent of Democrats approved compared to just 21 percent who disapproved. The Democratic base's disillusionment runs so deep that it's eerily reminiscent of Republican grassroots sentiment in the period leading up to Donald Trump's takeover of the Republican Party.\n\nThe numbers are clear: No longer satisfied with the status quo in their party, Democrats are on the verge of a Tea Party-style, intra-party revolt.\n\nThe Democratic approval data is unlike any in recent history - and it isn't a case of bitter, disaffected partisans reacting to a loss in the last election. The first time Democrats lost an election to Donald Trump, their congressional approval ratings within the party actually ticked up , as Democratic base voters largely approved of the ways that party leadership resisted the Trump administration in early 2017. The same phenomenon surfaced among Republicans in 2021 when, despite Trump's defeat and the subsequent chaos of Jan. 6, Republican voters remained generally positive regarding their views on the congressional GOP.\n\nThe closest partisan parallel to the level of anger currently gripping Democratic voters would be roughly a decade ago, when Republican political unknown Dave Brat toppled House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in a shocking 2014 primary upset.\n\nTwo years later, Trump tore through a crowded field of accomplished establishment candidates and forever upended Republican politics.\n\nDespite the restive energy in the party's progressive wing, the Democratic discontent does not seem to be centered around a desire to pull the party to the left or the right. Democrats cannot seem to agree on which direction the party should move in - recent Gallup polling found that 45 percent wanted the party to become more moderate, while 29 percent felt it should become more liberal, and 22 percent wanted it to stay the same.\n\nInstead, the numbers suggest that the fury is at least partly fueled by the Democratic base's dissatisfaction with congressional leadership's relatively conciliatory approach to Trump this time around, and their inability to stop him. Recent polls from CNN and Data For Progress both found supermajorities of Democratic voters calling for the party's congressional leadership to do more to oppose the president - a sentiment that sparked the fierce backlash against Schumer's recent move to facilitate the GOP's passage of a continuing resolution funding the government.\n\nHistoric precedent suggests it would be extremely unusual for this kind of dissatisfaction to persist without any major changes in the party, especially because these voters don't have anywhere else to go. Third parties continue to see their vote shares decline, and polarization between the two major parties continues to rise , meaning that the odds of these dissatisfied Democrats voting for non-Democratic candidates are extremely low.\n\nThat ratchets up pressure in the 2026 primary election season. Political science literature suggests that partisans angry enough to have an opinion on their party leadership are also the likeliest to show up and vote for Democrats anyway - so it is not clear that the party will incur a turnout penalty as a result.\n\nInstead, these numbers open the door to a potentially bruising string of primaries in both the House and Senate. There are 13 Democratic-held Senate seats up for reelection next year - many of them involving veteran senators in the bluest states - raising the prospect of a stream of younger, insurgent candidates more closely aligned with the party base, similar to what the GOP has contended with over the past 15 years.\n\nA handful of liberal groups have already called for Chuck Schumer to step down as party leader after voting last week for a GOP stopgap funding bill. Democratic House members have also felt the sting of grassroots rage in recent days at town halls marked by testy exchanges with deeply frustrated liberal constituents.\n\nHoping that the unrest blows over, and that Democratic voters return to the fold eventually, isn't a smart option. The Republican establishment learned it the hard way in 2010 and the two subsequent election cycles, when House and Senate incumbents and other party-backed candidates were frequently dragged into bruising primaries that resulted in shocking upsets.\n\nJust ask Eric Cantor."

      "text": "Democrats Need to Dig Deep\n\nManage your account\n\nPolitics is about changing the world. To change the world, you need power so you can implement the policies you think will help people. And to win power, you need to be able to get votes.\n\nAll this is fairly obvious, but we live in a political era where obvious and true things bear repeating. So allow me to state the obvious once more: To win votes, you can't have wildly different views from the public. That's a lesson Democrats seem to have forgotten.\n\nIn the wake of their 2024 loss, a significant portion of Democratic leadership seems to believe that what the party really needs is to change the messaging. They need more aggressive PR, better catchphrases, more viral stunts. They need to go on more podcasts!\n\nBetter PR and messaging strategy would help. But the core thing that held Democrats back in 2024 wasn't PR strategy. It was the party's beliefs and policies. If Democrats want to win the kind of large and durable majorities that will allow them to really govern, they're going to have to rethink those policies.\n\nWhat has the Democratic Party been up to since losing the 2024 election? They've been focused on revamping their public image and messaging strategy.\n\nIn early February, party insiders elected gun control activist and progressive gadfly David Hogg as vice chair of the DNC. The 24-year-old's campaign, when it wasn't busy with pillow-related ventures , centered on the need for \" better outreach \" and more combative messaging. And during President Donald Trump's address to Congress on March 4, Democrats decided it would be a great idea to look like huge dorks by holding up homemade signs that said things like \"Musk Steals\" and color-coordinating pink and white outfits. One member yelled at Trump and was ejected.\n\nMeanwhile, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York have been on a tour to \"Fight Oligarchy .\" Bernie's always had the ability to draw large crowds, but the rallies offer little beyond repeating the same talking points about billionaires he's been using for years.\n\nIn the wake of the interminable debate about finding a Democratic Joe Rogan -never mind that Rogan himself used to be exactly that -aspiring Patrick Bateman impersonator Gavin Newsom started a podcast . It's gone terribly and his net approval is down 10 points among Democrats. To give one more on-the-nose example: Here's a survey I was recently served on Facebook from the Democrats:\n\nNotice anything interesting? There's a \"progressive\" option but no \"liberal\" or \"moderate\" options. There's virtually no mention of health care, no mention of Trump's disastrous tariffs, no mention of building more housing. There's no caucus for lowering the cost of living or for boosting economic growth. But at least we got \"AANHPI,\" an identifier no Asian person has ever used in their life. We got \"interfaith,\" a meaningless slop term for a party too afraid to offend anyone's religious sensibilities in any way. Disabled Native youth will be covered in triplicate. It's just a social media poll, but it's emblematic of how Democrats are still focused on messaging strategies and pleasing internal identity groups that very few Americans actually care about.\n\nDemocrats didn't lose in 2024 because they needed to do more outreach to disadvantaged communities or interest groups. Nor were they a few podcast appearances or viral stunts away from victory. They lost because voters could tell that over the course of several years, the party drifted far out of line with the public on a number of highly salient issues. Democrats became the party of nags, aggressively scolding anyone who didn't speak the correct woke parlance. Joe Biden presided over a genuine border crisis and a broken asylum system that he was far too slow to address. Movements like Defund the Police and the pro-Palestine campus protests originated from the far left, leaving even moderate Democrats associated with policies that were deeply unpopular with voters . And, in the midst of trying to defend losing cultural positions, the biggest Democratic-run cities and states were often poorly governed, suffering from pervasive homelessness, public disorder, and untenable costs of living.\n\nIf you're of the liberal or progressive persuasion, you don't have to like this trend to acknowledge that it has electoral repercussions. I've spent years highlighting the benefits of increased immigration . I believe immigration has made America stronger and more prosperous throughout its entire history, and that it can continue to do so. But when the public is screaming that border security is an issue, you can't lecture the problem away. You need to respond to the actual concerns of voters or you're going to lose.\n\nThere's a role for persuasion in politics, of course. But persuasion takes time. If an issue is 70/30 or 80/20 against your party, you need to moderate your stances until you can make your case and change minds. Remember the obvious points we started with. Politics is about changing the world. To change the world you need power, and to get power you need votes. Democrats, in too many areas, continue to deviate from public opinion-afraid to denounce the 20 end of an 80/20 issue in the polls for fear of offending an interest group.\n\nDemocrats do themselves no favors by not loudly condemning the excesses of wokeness, which are real if often exaggerated . They do urban voters no favors when they fail to loudly denounce Defund the Police because progressive activists might get mad at them. They do immigrants no favors when they fail to deal with the border crisis-we're now in a situation where soccer players with asylum court dates are getting deported to notorious third world prisons with no court hearings or due process . If your immigration stance brought you to this point, of what use was the stance?\n\nThat's not to say Democrats must abandon their liberal values-after all, Trump's takeover of the GOP has seen Republicans largely abandoning liberalism in favor of lawlessness. But Democrats do need to change. They can get visibly tougher on illegal immigration while still advocating for more legal pathways and the fair treatment of immigrants. They can focus on the LGBT rights that matter like non-discrimination in the workplace, non-discrimination in housing, and access to health care-rather than dying on dubious and unpopular niche issues like trans athletes in women's sports. They can loudly denounce the excesses of DEI (such as mandatory diversity statements for technical STEM research) while preserving diversity and inclusion ideas that still make sense (such as honoring civil rights heroes like Jackie Robinson). They can advocate for intelligent police reforms while still taking a hard stance against public disorder, crime, and anti-social behavior.\n\nAnd most importantly, Democrats need to come out full throttle against Trump's disastrous tariffs and promise to repeal them on day one. They need to become a party that actually cares about the cost of living, the housing crisis, and clean energy. If they want voters to trust them, Democrats must show that they can effectively run the cities and states they govern locally.\n\nAll these ideas require real policy change. It's likely to piss off several entrenched interest groups inside the party. Democrats should do it anyway.\n\nThe real danger, paradoxically, is that Democrats probably don't need to do any of this to win in the 2026 midterms. Thermostatic backlash is one of the strongest forces in American politics right now, and Trump's approval ratings are already cratering . Trump's administration is breaking things at an astonishing rate, his tariffs are causing chaos and are set to increase the cost of living , and the country may be barreling toward a recession. By 2026 the odds are that MAGA and Trump will be deeply unpopular and Democrats can coast to a midterm victory without having to change much of anything.\n\nBut that's not the path to a durable majority. That's a recipe for eternally getting 48 to 51 percent of the vote, a path where you flip a coin every four years to see if you got lucky this presidential cycle. Democrats need to aim for something more, and the only way to win larger majorities is to aim at the middle.\n\nKamala Harris, to her credit, seemed at least partially aware of this. She ran a decent campaign in 2024 that tried to reverse some of the leftward lurch of her party. She rarely emphasized her race or gender and moderated from the more left-leaning stances she took as a Democratic primary candidate in 2020. But three things dragged her down. First, the Democratic Party is often judged not just by what its leaders say but by the actions of activists, influencers, and academics who have collectively veered far to the left. That trend has been decades in the making, and for many voters, their perceptions of the party were already locked in place. Second, Harris' ill-fated turn as an ultra-progressive in the 2020 primary dampened the credibility of her 2024 turn toward the center. And third, Harris refused to break with Joe Biden. One of the defining moments of the 2024 campaign came when Harris told the ladies of The View that she couldn't think of a single thing she would have done differently from Biden. It was an act of political malpractice-Biden was deeply unpopular and when offered a chance to distance herself from him, she refused to do so.\n\nOther Democrats are attempting to point in a new direction. Gavin Newsom's podcast adventures show signs of moderation-he has denounced leftist positions on trans women in sports and tried to find common ground with conservatives. But unfortunately, his method for doing so has been to invite rabid MAGA partisans like Steve Bannon and Charlie Kirk and act like their buddies. That's not what the furious Democratic base wants-they want someone who will fight Trump with everything they've got, not lean into MAGA.\n\nThe left wing of the party is more than happy to fight. But they're still arguing that left-wing policies would be more popular if only we did more activism, or if only we had better messaging strategy. They often claim that by focusing on economic issues, they can duck hard conversations about immigration or culture, aiming for a new politics of evasion . Rather than listen to them, mainstream Democrats need to aggressively moderate. Many of these progressive activists have spent years warning that Trump and the MAGA movement pose a danger to our democracy. The activists are correct on that point, which raises an obvious question: If Trump is so dangerous, why in God's name have those activists spent the entirety of the Trump era sticking Democrats with hideously unpopular far-left positions?\n\nDemocrats can't evade the public on their unpopular positions by focusing on economic populism, by going on more podcasts, or by having a better ground game. At some point, you need to directly address those positions and break with the past. They need to fight Trump's illiberal and authoritarian power grabs, but do it while moderating their views. Until Democrats figure that out, they risk being stuck in the political wilderness.\n\nRead more at The Dispatch\n\nThe Dispatch is a new digital media company providing engaged citizens with fact-based reporting and commentary, informed by conservative principles.

Sanders, an Independent, sought the Democratic nomination in 2016 and 2020.\n\nHarris's former running-mate Tim Walz was also tied with Ocasio-Cortez at 5 percent, as was California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is often touted as a future party leader despite little national experience.\n\nAfter Harris , the most popular response at 13 percent was \"don't know/ no opinion,\" while 10 percent chose former transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nBillionaire Mark Cuban and Pennsylvania Gov.

We deserve a real conversation,\" Villaraigosa said. \"We had a 100-day campaign. So no, you can't get in at the end of the rainbow. Get in now.\"\n\n\"It hurts every candidate in the race to have that looming over us,\" one Democratic consultant working on the governor's race told Politico . \"[Harris] has the luxury of waiting as long as she wants, but I don't think that's good for the race, good for the party, or good for the voters.\""

      "text": "In Upset, Democrats Projected To Flip GOP-Held State Senate Seat In Pennsylvania\n\nManage your account\n\nDemocrat James Malone is projected to win a special election for Pennsylvania's 36th state Senate district on Tuesday night, narrowly triumphing in a district President Donald Trump won by 15 percentage points in November.\n\nMalone's victory over Republican Josh Parsons is a significant upset, and an encouraging sign Democrats' coalition of highly engaged, highly educated voters continues to give them an advantage in low-turnout but crucial special elections. It's also an early but small sign of growing voter anger with Republicans.\n\nBefore the election, Malone told local media that voters in the county were frustrated with the role billionaire Elon Musk has played in the Trump administration.\n\n\"Josh Parsons might be OK with that, but I'm not,\" Malone told Lancaster Online . \"On Tuesday, you'll get to make the choice between more Musk, or Lancaster values.\"\n\nMalone led Parsons 50% to 49%, a lead of less than 500 votes, according to results posted by the Pennsylvania Secretary of State. The district includes most of Lancaster County, a rural county in the south central part of the state best known for its Amish population.\n\nMalone is the mayor of East Petersburg, a small borough in Lancaster County. Parsons is a Lancaster County commissioner. The two were running to fill a seat vacated by Republican Sen. Ryan Aument, who took a job working for freshman U.S. Sen. Dave McMormick.\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D), who recorded a robocall encouraging Democrats to vote for Malone, celebrated the victory on social media .\n\n\"Tonight in Lancaster County, Pennsylvanians rejected a candidate who embraced the extremism and division coming out of DC,\" Shapiro wrote. \"In a district carried comfortably by Donald Trump just a few months ago, they chose a better way forward - an embrace of competence, commonsense, and a desire to bring people together.\"\n\nMalone's victory shrinks the GOP advantage in the state Senate to 27-23. In a separate election outside Pittsburgh, the Democratic candidate ran well ahead of former Vice President Kamala Harris' margins in a Democratic seat to maintain the party's narrow 102-101 advantage in Pennsylvania's state House.\n\nDemocrats similarly flipped a heavily Republican state Senate seat in Iowa in January. Some Democratic operatives were looking at Malone's victory as a sign the party could be competitive in a tentatively scheduled congressional special election in upstate New York this summer."

Chuck Schumer , who faced what they saw as an awful choice: shut the government down or consent to a Republican funding bill that allows President Donald Trump to continue slashing the federal government.\n\nAfter Mr. Schumer announced that he would reluctantly support the bill, he bore the brunt of that anger, including a protest at his office, calls from progressives that he be primaried in 2028 and suggestions that the Democratic Party would soon be looking for new leaders.\n\nNine other members of the Democratic Caucus - a contingent of mostly swing-state and retiring senators - eventually joined Mr. Schumer in voting to advance the Republican funding proposal, providing crucial support to bring it to a final vote. It passed late Friday with Sens. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Angus King of Maine voting with Republicans in favor.\n\nSince their election losses, Democrats have been hunkered against a barrage of Mr. Trump's early actions in office, locked out of legislative power and left searching for a plan to regain political momentum. But as Mr. Schumer let pass one of the rare moments when the party might regain leverage in Washington, the Democratic Party erupted in a moment of anger that had been building for months.\n\nMany in the party felt the New York Democrat was not showing sufficient fight , arguing that a government shutdown would have forced Trump and Republicans to the negotiating table. Yet for Mr. Schumer, who has led Senate Democrats since Mr. Trump took office in 2016, the choice ultimately came down to preventing a shutdown that he believed would only hand Mr. Trump more power and leave his party with the blame for disruptions to government services.\n\n\"A shutdown would allow DOGE to shift into overdrive,\" Mr. Schumer warned on the Senate floor Friday, referring to the Department of Government Efficiency effort led by Elon Musk.\n\nMr. Schumer voted no on the final vote for the funding bill, which only needed a simple majority to pass. Nonetheless, House Democrats released a stream of angry statements and social media posts aimed at Mr. Schumer.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Troy Carter of Louisiana shared a photo of Mr. Trump and Mr. Schumer engaged in conversation with the caption, \"A picture is worth a thousand words!\"\n\nEven in the Senate, hardly any Democrats were speaking up in support of Mr. Schumer's strategy Friday. It was a remarkable turn for the longtime Democratic leader, leaving him standing practically alone.\n\nSpeaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, his longtime ally and partner in funding fights of the past, said in a statement, \"Let's be clear: neither is a good option for the American people. But this false choice that some are buying instead of fighting is unacceptable.\"\n\nMs. Pelosi added that the senators should listen to the women who lead appropriations for Democrats, Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut and Sen. Patty Murray of Washington. They had proposed a 30-day stopgap plan instead of the Republican proposal that provides funding until September. The Republican bill will trim $13 billion in non-defense spending from the levels in the 2024 budget year and increase defense spending by $6 billion.\n\nAs House Democrats, who almost all voted against the bill earlier this week, concluded a retreat in northern Virginia Friday, they also called for their Senate colleagues to show more fight. House Democratic leadership rushed back to the Capitol to hold a news conference and urge senators to reject the bill.\n\n\"We do not want to shutdown the government. But we are not afraid of a government funding showdown,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said.\n\nHe also repeatedly declined to answer questions about whether he had confidence in Mr. Schumer.\n\nOther Democrats, such as Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who is seen as a potential presidential candidate in 2028 and also visited the Democratic retreat, called for a broader movement. He mentioned the recent 60th anniversary of peaceful civil rights protests in Selma, Alabama, and argued that Democrats need to find \"collective courage.\"\n\n\"When those individuals marched, there wasn't one voice,\" Mr. Beshear said. \"There was a collective courage of that group that changed the world. That day opened up the eyes of the country to what was really going on.\"\n\nSome were ready to start marching.\n\n\"We're ready to get out of this building and head back to the Capitol at any moment and prevent the government from shutting down,\" said Rep. Greg Casar of Texas, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.\n\n\"Now is the moment for Democrats to draw a line in the stand and say that we stand very firmly on the side of working class people and against the ultra-rich that are trying to corrupt our government for themselves,\" he added.\n\nMeanwhile, some of the nation's most influential progressive groups warned of serious political consequences for Senate Democrats and predicted a fierce backlash when members of Congress return home next week.\n\nEzra Levin, co-founder of Indivisible, which has organized hundreds of protests across the nation, said that nearly 8 in 10 of the group's activists support primary challenges against \"Senate Dems who cave on the GOP bill.\"\n\nHe wrote on social media that the vast majority of those Democratic activists plan to express their anger at town halls or other public events next week. MoveOn, another progressive group that claims nearly 10 million members nationwide, predicted that its activists would also demand answers from Democratic officials in the coming days\n\n\"Clearing the way for Donald Trump and Elon Musk to gut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid is unacceptable. It's past time for Democrats to fight and stop acting like it's business as usual,\" said Joel Payne, a spokesperson for MoveOn.\n\nSenate Democrats were also mostly unwilling to speak up to defend Mr. Schumer's move. Sen. Raphael Warnock, a Georgia Democrat, even suggested that the party should be looking for new leaders in the coming years.\n\n\"I think come '26, '28, we'll get some new leadership,\" he said. His office later said Warnock was answering the question broadly.\n\nMostly, though, senators just lamented that they had been jammed by a Republican Party that has found a new sense of unity under Mr. Trump. For years, House Republicans have not been able to muster votes for government funding on their own, forcing them into bipartisan negotiations. This time, they passed the bill on party lines and left Washington.\n\n\"We're stuck with two bad choices presented by a unified Republican front,\" said Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Or force a shutdown that many worry would only lead to deeper cuts to the federal workforce.\n\n\"You have two things that are truly abhorrent. When you get to that level, it's hard to rank one versus the other. That's why it's a hard decision,\" says Democratic Sen. John Hickenlooper of Colorado. \"They are both such great evils.\"\n\nA government shutdown could happen on March 14 if the House and Senate can't agree on a bill. After the House passed a bill with basically only Republican votes, Senate Democrats are facing a difficult set of choices, with no good options.\n\nHouse Republicans passed a bill on Tuesday that would keep the government open through September, while handing more power to President Trump to shift around funds, cutting real domestic spending, and punishing the District of Columbia by forcing the city to make deep spending cuts even though its budget is funded by local taxpayer money.\n\nDemocrats are outraged at the provisions, and are facing fierce demands from their base to do something, anything, to stand up to Mr. Trump as he and billionaire Elon Musk slash the government workforce. But if they force a shutdown starting at 12:01 a.m. Saturday morning, many worry it will backfire. The Trump administration will be in charge of implementing that shutdown, which means it will determine which workers are \"essential\" and must keep working for no pay, and which can be sent home. And as the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) cuts a wide swath through the federal workforce, Democrats worry that could make it even easier for the administration to fire people - while putting the blame on them.\n\nWhile Republicans have often leveraged government shutdowns - or the threat of them - to extract major policy wins over the past decade-plus, Democrats, as the more pro-government party, have been far more reluctant to do so. The lone exception came early in Mr. Trump's first term, when Democrats triggered a brief shutdown over immigration issues before quickly folding. But this time, it's unclear which step would better protect government employees and the work they do. The Trump administration is already slashing programs and staff left and right. And this is one of the few moments where Democrats have any real power.\n\nThe showdown comes as the Trump administration continues its widespread, and potentially illegal, evisceration of the federal government. Even as Senate Democrats were debating the least terrible path forward, the Department of Education announced it was laying off about half of its workforce - 1,300 employees - the latest in a series of deep government cuts not authorized by Congress. So far, the Trump administration, aided by Mr. Musk's DOGE team, has laid off tens of thousands of government workers across various agencies, and is signaling even deeper cuts to come.\n\nDemocrats emerged from the latest in a series of long, tense lunch meetings on Wednesday, from which raised voices could be heard in the halls, with a simulacrum of a strategy: They'd demand a vote on extending government funding at current levels for one month, giving appropriators time to work out a longer extension.\n\n\"Republicans do not have the votes in the Senate\" to pass the Republican House bill, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Wednesday afternoon on the Senate floor.\n\nBut Democrats' measure appears to be more of a face-saving effort than one that could actually work. If enough Democrats vote to consider the House bill, and their amendment then fails, as seems likely, Republicans can then pass it without Democratic votes. Both sides expect that in the end Democrats are more likely than not to allow the Republican bill to pass.\n\nSenate Republicans have scheduled a procedural vote for Friday. They will likely need eight Senate Democrats to vote with them to move forward. As the deadline approached, some Democrats who often back bipartisan measures signaled they're not interested in helping out.\n\nSenator Hickenlooper told the Monitor Wednesday afternoon that he thought both options risked making it easier for President Trump and Mr. Musk \"to drive their agenda\" of slashing the federal workforce. But he announced on social media that evening that opposing the GOP bill and risking a government shutdown was the least bad option.\n\nVirginia Sen. Mark Warner, one of the Senate's more moderate and bipartisan members, came to the same conclusion. Senator Warner also represents a state with a high number of federal government workers - and has long been a supporter of Washington, D.C., just over the river from his state. On Thursday morning, he posted a video declaring that he wouldn't vote to allow the GOP plan to proceed, saying it was a \"gratuitous\" and \"mean-spirited\" attack on D.C. and would cause damage to neighboring Virginia. He also said he would refuse to \"turn over the keys with no restraint to Trump and Musk.\"\n\nThe only Democrat who has publicly pledged to vote for the GOP plan is Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman. Despite his unhappiness with some of the GOP provisions of the bill, he says a shutdown would hurt Americans more and blow up in Democrats' faces politically. He predicted \"it won't take long before [Democrats are] begging\" to reopen the government.\n\nHouse Democrats made the opposite calculation. All but one Democrat voted against the GOP-passed plan earlier in the week. Many expressed frustration that their Senate counterparts weren't showing the same collective spine.\n\nNew York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told the Monitor, \"I sure hope they don't,\" when asked how she wanted Senate Democrats to vote on the GOP plan.\n\n\"This creates a massive slush fund for Donald Trump [and] Elon Musk,\" she says. \"I think it is irresponsible. It removes any of the guardrails around ensuring that these funds that are appropriated are spent responsibly. I don't think it's right.\"\n\nIt's not just progressives like Representative Ocasio-Cortez who want their Senate colleagues to oppose the bill.\n\n\"People with two-year terms showed some courage. Let's see what people with six-year terms will do,\" Rep. Scott Peters, a moderate Democrat from California, told the Monitor as he exited the House floor after the vote.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\nBut House Democrats' choice to vote against the GOP bill was more theoretical. If Senate Democrats follow through, it will actually trigger a government shutdown.

And how we respond to these crises today, will impact not only our lives, but the lives of our kids, future generations, and in terms of climate change, the very well-being of the planet,\" Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders tells more than 3,000 rallygoers at a park in Las Vegas Thursday. They yell their approval as he shouts \"no\" to a government run by billionaires and while calling for one that works for everyone.\n\nThe rumpled octogenarian and two-time presidential candidate has no plans to seek the Oval Office again. But at a time when much of the Democratic Party is stunned by the Trumpian onslaught, grasping for a strategy and a message, it's telling that Senator Sanders, for now, is stepping into the void - and striking a chord.\n\nThe curmudgeonly Vermont senator is bringing his populist message to swing districts in the heartland and West, drawing large crowds. This week he's joined by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, another pugilistic politician who could inherit the Sanders mantle.\n\nIn recent weeks, Mr. Sanders has been bringing his populist message to swing districts narrowly won by Republicans throughout the heartland and West. His Fighting Oligarchy tour is drawing surprisingly large crowds, in a year with no major elections on the horizon.\n\nIn Warren, Michigan, earlier this month, some 10,000 people turned out to hear Mr. Sanders rail against the Trump administration, which he says is leading the United States toward \"authoritarianism\" and \"kleptocracy.\" In Las Vegas on Thursday, organizers had to change venues at the last minute to accommodate all the attendees. In Tempe, Arizona, some 15,000 people showed up, according to organizers, who say 50,000 people have RSVP'd for the rallies in the West.\n\n\"Everybody's looking for someone to get them out of this mess,\" says Tad Devine, a Democratic consultant who was chief strategist for Mr. Sanders' 2016 campaign. \"He's kind of a St. John the Baptist of this thing. He's out there sort of calling, saying, 'Hey, we've got to do something about this.'\"\n\nLike John the Baptist, Mr. Sanders seems to understand that his ultimate job may be to help pave the way for the party's next savior. On his latest stretch of the tour, he brought along New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, one of the party's other progressive stars, young enough to be his granddaughter. Only 29 years old when first elected to Congress in 2018, and like Mr. Sanders, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has described herself as \"evolving.\" Some suggest she may eventually end up in the Senate or seek the presidency.\n\nShe had plenty of fans at the rally, who admire her for standing up for progressive values and not giving ground, even to other Democrats. \"She's assassin smart,\" says Mike Dicosta, a retiree at the rally with his hiking friends. \"She's one of us,\" says Angela Dorsey - that is, working-class.\n\nSeveral rallygoers said they could see the young progressive taking on the mantle of Mr. Sanders. He's got experience with national organizing that she could learn from, and she's got an enviable command of social media. He had a strong following among Latinos, who affectionately called their political uncle \"Tio Bernie.\" She has a Puerto Rican background. Democrats are going to have to win back Hispanics they lost to Donald Trump in 2024.\n\nMost important, both she and Mr. Sanders bring the kind of fighting posture many Democratic voters seem particularly hungry for right now.\n\n\"We're going to take our country back!\" Ms. Ocasio-Cortez promised an eager crowd, marveling at an audience bigger than she had anticipated. When she asked how many people were first-time rallygoers, a sea of hands went up.\n\nOther Democratic officials are trying out different kinds of appeals. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, another politician with an eye on 2028, has drawn attention and controversy by having prominent MAGA figures on his new podcast in recent weeks. Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, in her response to the president's joint address to Congress, put forward a pragmatic kind of politics, focusing on kitchen table issues.\n\n\"There's clearly a bunch of different approaches going on,\" says Democratic strategist Joe Trippi. Mr. Sanders is one of a medley of effective Democratic voices out there, he argues, and it's a mistake to think only a Democratic populist can stop \"the populist Trump.\" \"It's going to take everything, and it won't be one wing, or one flavor, or one person.\"\n\nStill, he adds, Mr. Sanders clearly recognizes the high stakes - and is speaking with a particular urgency.\n\nOrganizers describe the Fighting Oligarchy tour as a pressure campaign to force vulnerable members of Congress to vote against any potential cuts to Medicaid, housing, nutrition, education, and other \"basic needs\" in order to pay for Republican tax breaks for rich people.\n\n\"What we are trying to do is, in one way or another, maybe create a party within the party, of bringing millions of young people, working-class people, people of color, to demand that the Democratic Party start standing with the working class of this country and take on the very powerful corporate interests that have never had it so good,\" Mr. Sanders said in a March 18 interview with CNN.\n\nThe tour comes at a time of particular division and anxiety among Democrats following their November loss of the White House and Senate. A recent CNN poll shows a record low approval rating for the Democratic Party - only 29%, the lowest since the network started polling in 1992.\n\nInfighting boiled over after Democratic Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer voted for a Republican spending bill last week to avert a government shutdown. It passed but exposed a sharp disagreement among Democrats in Congress. Both Mr. Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez opposed the bill and wanted to use the threat of a shutdown as leverage against President Trump and congressional Republicans.\n\nSenator Schumer, facing calls to step aside from leadership, argues that a government shutdown would have been far worse for average Americans. But Democrats aren't in the mood for cooperation with Republicans.\n\n\"I'm very, very, very, very disappointed in Democrats,\" says Antonio Salas Jr. at the Las Vegas rally, wearing a \"Deport Elon\" button. A two-time Sanders voter, he says, \"It's time to step up and not be nice anymore. I'm a firm believer now that we need to go lower, period, to defend our freedoms, our Constitution.\"\n\nThat's borne out in the new CNN poll, which finds that Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents would rather the party stop the GOP agenda than work with Republicans to try to get some Democratic ideas passed - 57% to 42%. It's a stark reversal from President Trump's first term, when 74% of Democrats and independents aligned with them wanted the party to work with Republicans to further Democratic priorities.\n\nWhen the poll asked them to name the leader they feel best reflects \"the core values\" of the Democratic Party, the top performer was the former bartender from the Bronx, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, at 10%. The next two were former Vice President and presidential nominee Kamala Harris at 9% and Senator Sanders at 8%.\n\n\"He sees a moment, and he's probably right - there is an opportunity here,\" says Mindy Romero, director of the Center for Inclusive Democracy at the University of Southern California. She sees Mr. Sanders trying to use this moment \"to undermine Trump - but also to build on the movement that he has cared about\" for decades, pushing for free child care and public college, as well as a national health insurance program, Medicare for All.\n\nThe Vermont senator's message may not resonate with everyone. Senator Sanders' version of left-wing populism aspires to even bigger government, at a time when there is very little trust in institutions. And while Elon Musk may be giving billionaires a bad name among some voters, many still view achieving wealth as part of the American dream.\n\n\"Bernie Sanders, and his soak-the-rich message, especially, is not going to work, because even Americans that are not wealthy aspire to be,\" says Brian Seitchik, a Republican consultant in Arizona who was Mr. Trump's state director in 2016 and regional political director in 2020.\n\nThe senator's core argument - which hasn't really changed over the years - failed twice at the presidential level, Mr. Seitchik points out. \"If he's going to be the face of the Democratic Party for the next two years, I say, 'Fantastic!'\"\n\nYet Mr. Sanders has also been speaking directly to economic issues for over a decade, addressing cost-of-living problems, like housing and health care, that have only gotten worse. Some say the party should have been echoing him more closely all along.\n\n\"I think that's really why people listened to him, because he was talking about issues that were the source of their economic anxiety,\" says Mr. Devine, the Democratic consultant. \"And that economic anxiety has not gotten better between 2016 and today.\"\n\nIf Mr. Trump has an Achilles' heel, it may be the economy. The president has lately conceded that a recession may be necessary to achieve the economic change he's looking for. And his tariffs have not been popular. Recent polls have shown a majority of Americans now disapprove of Mr. Trump's handling of the economy.\n\nIf that view persists, the president could face a backlash in the midterm elections - regardless of whether Democrats have unified message or a messenger by then, says David Byler, chief of research at the polling firm Noble Predictive Insights in Phoenix. In 2018, \"It wasn't clear who the Democrats were; it wasn't clear who their leader was,\" yet they still won control of the House, says Mr. Byler.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

And yet somehow, the first month of President Donald Trump's second administration has exceeded many Democrats' worst expectations.\n\nMr. Trump is signing executive orders at a head-spinning clip - banning diversity initiatives, attempting to end birthright citizenship, and more. Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is taking a wrecking ball to the federal bureaucracy, freezing funding and culling the workforce. Republicans in Congress are swiftly confirming even Mr. Trump's most controversial Cabinet nominees.\n\nIn the face of the onslaught, Democratic officials have been trying to do something - anything - to throw sand in the gears and gin up party enthusiasm ahead of next year's midterm elections.\n\nShut out of power in Washington, the Democratic Party is struggling to find a comprehensive message. The biggest challenge may be getting voters' attention.\n\nSo far, it's been rough going.\n\nWithout control of either the House or the Senate, Democrats by their own admission are largely powerless in Washington. Congressional leaders have been organizing protests outside endangered agencies, only to be met with chants of \"Do your job!\" Last week, more than two dozen lawmakers pulled an all-nighter on the Senate floor to try to block Mr. Trump's nominee to lead the Office of Management and Budget - and then watched that nominee, Russell Vought, get confirmed the next evening.\n\nAt a telephone town hall Wednesday updating his constituents on the party's \"efforts to fight back,\" Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen said a top priority will be to protect Medicaid. An amendment he'd introduced earlier in the day to do just that, however, had already failed along party lines.\n\n\"We're the minority party. We don't have the power to pass legislation. We don't have the power alone to block nominees,\" says Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, in an interview. Senator Murphy, who took the 2 a.m. shift during last week's all-nighter, has taken to relentlessly posting on social media, launching daily broadsides against the Trump administration's actions. \"There was an election and we lost. There are consequences that come with that.\"\n\nThe only real victories being notched by the \"resistance\" right now are coming from activist groups and the states - with Democratic attorneys general and organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union bringing lawsuits. So far, judges have paused a number of the administration's actions, as cases move through the courts. Congressional Democrats may finally gain a bit of leverage next month, when Republican leaders will likely need their votes in their efforts to raise the debt ceiling and fund the government before a March 14 deadline.\n\nRight now, though, Democrats are finding it a challenge not just to respond - but even to be heard, as Mr. Trump's daily barrage of actions and \"what-did-he-just-say\" pronouncements suck up all the oxygen. With the president putting forward different measures seemingly designed to outrage different segments of the Democratic base on any given day, the party is struggling to elevate a single message that can cut through all the noise.\n\n\"We have to be strategic about what we fight, even if we hate all of it,\" says Rodell Mollineau, a Democratic strategist. \"If we as a party attack everything the president does, it's going to fall on deaf ears. We need to pick one or two positions that we have credibility on, and we need to drive that narrative.\"\n\nSenator Murphy, for one, says he doesn't believe \"it was coincidental\" that Mr. Trump made a shocking statement about wanting to take over Gaza just as Democrats felt they were gaining traction with their attacks on DOGE and with what was happening to the U.S. Agency for International Development. The statement effectively changed the conversation on a dime.\n\n\"The leader of the Republican Party spent years as a reality TV star,\" agrees Mr. Mollineau. \"Holding the viewers' attention and manipulating the media is something that the president does well.\"\n\nDemocrats need to be more disciplined, says Pat Dennis, president of the Democratic super PAC American Bridge 21st Century. Instead of allowing Mr. Trump to perpetually keep them on their heels with what former Trump adviser Steve Bannon has called a \"flood the zone\" strategy - making the speed of news so fast that Democrats can't address it all and voters disengage - Mr. Dennis says Democrats need to keep it simple. Focus on three issues, he says: health care, the economy, and public safety.\n\nIn the meantime, Mr. Dennis says groups like his will be focused on making sure moderate Republican lawmakers who side with Mr. Trump - like Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina - \"pay a price\" in next year's midterm elections.\n\nPolitical history would suggest that Democrats have a reasonable shot at gaining back some ground in elections later this year and next. After Mr. Trump's first victory in 2016, Democrats gained 40 seats and took back the majority in the House of Representatives in 2018.\n\nBut that chance at redemption is still nearly two years away. And in the meantime, their options for fighting back are limited.\n\n\"We're going to try to stop some of their agenda. We're not just punting to the elections,\" says Mr. Murphy. \"Obviously I don't think we should make Republicans' life easy inside the Senate.\"\n\nIn some cases, a strong pressure campaign alone can influence the course of legislation. Mr. Murphy and other Democrats point to 2017, when the party raised \"such a public outroar\" about Republicans' attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act that the effort ultimately failed.\n\nOnly barely, however. The repeal passed the Republican-controlled House but went down in the Senate by one vote, after the late GOP Sen. John McCain voted against it. Independent-minded Republicans like Senator McCain have mostly been rooted out of the party since then.\n\n\"The base doesn't want to hear this, but this is not 2017,\" says Mr. Mollineau. \"There are not as many Republicans willing to stand in his way. Trump didn't understand how this town worked.\"\n\nIndeed, this time around Mr. Trump appears far more emboldened by what he calls a mandate from the American people. He won the popular vote in 2024, unlike in 2016, and is beginning his second term with higher approval ratings than he had during his first term.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, are looking at the highest unfavorable ratings for their party since Quinnipiac University began polling in 2008.\n\nTo Ben Wikler, the Wisconsin Democratic Party chair who recently lost a bid to become the next Democratic National Committee chair, Democrats need both a better message and a better mechanism for delivering it.\n\n\"The problem is (a) when Democrats talk, no one can hear, and (b) when they can hear, Democrats are selling the ingredients and not the brownies,\" he says.\n\nHe and other strategists argue that Democratic leaders at the state level have an increasingly important role to play. Mr. Wikler points to his own state, where Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul joined 22 other states in a lawsuit against the Trump administration's freezing of federal grants and loans. This week, a judge responded by issuing a temporary restraining order.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Governor Evers, for example, recently released a proposal to provide free breakfast and lunch for all students.\n\n\"This is a moment when state-level Democratic leaders have an extraordinary responsibility, and opportunity, to demonstrate an ultimate vision,\" says Mr. Wikler. \"Demonstrate what Democrats can do when they are entrusted with the keys.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

And her inability to convince enough voters that she could do a better job than Donald Trump on the economy cost her the election.\n\nTwo-thirds of voters rated the economy poorly, according to exit polls . President-elect Trump won them 70% to 28%. Nearly half of all voters said their family's financial situation was worse today than four years ago - and they backed Mr. Trump 81% to 17%.\n\nWorking-class voters abandoned Kamala Harris in droves. Democrats are fighting about what went wrong - and where to go from here.\n\nAnd less-well-off voters were more likely to swing to Mr. Trump. In 2020, he lost voters who made less than $50,000 by 10 points. This year, according to exit polls, he lost them by just 1 point. He lost voters who make between $50,000 and $100,000 by 15 points in 2020 - and won them this election. The only group that moved toward Ms. Harris was voters who make six-figure incomes. She won them by 5 points this year, after President Joe Biden lost them by 12 points in 2020.\n\nDemocrats are uniformly alarmed that working-class voters who once made up the core of the Democratic base continued to abandon the party in droves. But they don't agree on why that happened, with some pointing to a failure to focus enough on pocketbook issues and \"soaking the rich,\" while others slammed tin-eared and sometimes condescending messaging from a professional class dominated by white college graduates.\n\n\"Working-class voters vote more on their perceived economic self-interest than abstract debates over things like democracy,\" says Jeff Hauser, a Democratic strategist and former spokesperson for the AFL-CIO, the largest union federation in the United States. \"Unfortunately, Democrats ran a campaign that in their national message was predominantly about abstract concerns like democracy, and less about the economy.\"\n\nThe big disagreement among Democrats isn't about the national headwinds. It's whether Ms. Harris and the party could have made major strategic decisions in the race's closing months to prevail anyway. Some are griping that the party didn't message effectively enough on the economy, and took for granted Hispanic voters until it was too late. They are also debating whether they fundamentally have too many college-educated liberal white people who come off as insincere when talking to blue-collar voters of all ethnic backgrounds.\n\n\"I think we've done a lot to demonstrate that we're a party largely of white elites,\" says Democratic strategist Andy Barr, who pointed to issues like student loan forgiveness as a way to alienate blue-collar voters.\n\n\"Most people in this country don't go to college, and we sort of act as if they do. Most Latinos in this country aren't fixated on immigration policy, and we sort of act as if they are,\" he says. \"We're running campaigns that sort of serve us and our interests, and not the people we say we're running to represent.\"\n\nOne former Biden White House strategist, who asked that they not be named in order to speak candidly, said the party needs to do some deep soul-searching about why Latinos and working-class voters of all stripes decided that Mr. Trump was their best bet economically.\n\n\"Democrats are going to need to take some time to analyze, to rethink the way we engage voters, and talk about policies, and talk about our accomplishments,\" they said. \"The party does need to tackle that issue head-on. It's probably the most important thing for the rebirth of the Democratic Party.\"\n\nDemocrats may simply have forgotten Maslow's hierarchy of needs. People prioritize basic needs first - finances, stability, safety - and subordinate everything else if those primary issues aren't addressed. Inflation, illegal immigration, and crime, all of which spiked in the first few years of the Biden-Harris administration coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic (before dipping over the past year), were more salient and immediate to many voters than issues like protecting democracy or abortion access. Nearly one-third of voters who believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases voted for Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Trump even won some voters who admitted they didn't like him and worried about his policy views. By a 10-point margin, voters said he's \"too extreme,\" while a narrow majority of voters said Ms. Harris wasn't; of the 53% of voters who hold an unfavorable view of him, 9% voted for him anyway.\n\nThe unemployment rate is hovering at historic lows, and the stock market has boomed. But rent and groceries are still expensive - and that hurts a lot more for voters with limited means.\n\nSome leading figures on the left are now saying Democrats lost because they didn't do enough to fix it.\n\n\"It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them,\" Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said in a postelection statement. \"First, it was the white working class, and now it is Latino and Black workers as well. While the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry and want change. And they're right.\"\n\nBut around the globe, voters have punished incumbent parties on the left, right, and center for inflation - which was fueled by pandemic-driven supply chain interruptions and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, as well as massive government spending that many countries undertook to keep their economies afloat during the depths of the COVID-19 shutdown and its aftermath.\n\nA Financial Times analysis found that in all 10 developed countries that have held elections this year, the governing party did worse than in the previous race - the first time this has ever happened. In fact, Democrats saw their vote share drop by a smaller amount than other ruling parties.\n\nStill, U.S. voters clearly weren't happy with the state of things. A majority, 59%, disapproved of Mr. Biden, including 45% who strongly disapproved. Ms. Harris, as his vice president, had an albatross around her neck the whole campaign.\n\nOne challenge was that many of Democrats' economic achievements were tucked into sprawling packages, with benefits that were only going to emerge in the long run or were already being phased out. The bipartisan infrastructure bill is just getting shovel-ready projects going. The Biden administration passed a hard cap on out-of-pocket Medicare spending - which will save money for a lot of older adults - but it doesn't kick in until 2025. The $3,600 child tax credits that were included in their 2021 pandemic relief package helped pull millions of children out of poverty, but expired after one year - which left families feeling, rightly, like they suddenly had less money now.\n\nEven President Biden acknowledged that on Thursday, saying the \"vast majority\" of the good economic work his administration had done for the economy won't be felt for years, with policies and projects \"only now just really kicking in.\"\n\nAnd even if there were an economic record to sell, many Democrats gripe that they didn't have a candidate who could sell it for the past few years. As President Biden became more visibly frail, his staff limited his public appearances, turning down even traditional layups like the pre-Super Bowl interview. His disastrous June debate eventually forced him out of the race, leaving Ms. Harris just 107 days to build a presidential campaign and define herself to voters.\n\nDavid Plouffe, Ms. Harris' top adviser, posted on the social media platform X that the campaign had \"dug out of a deep hole\" - an implicit criticism of Mr. Biden.\n\nThere are some signs that the Harris campaign's ad messaging and ground game actually did make a difference - even though it wasn't enough. She lost far less ground compared with in the 2020 election in the swing states where she campaigned than she did in the rest of the country. Milwaukee County, which includes the city and some inner suburbs, was the rare place where Mr. Trump only improved on his 2020 margins by 1 point. Mecklenburg County, North Carolina (Charlotte), moved just 2 points to the right, as did Fulton County, Georgia, which includes much of Atlanta.\n\nBut the shift toward Mr. Trump was much more dramatic in some major metro areas that the campaigns didn't seriously contest.\n\nMiami-Dade County moved 19 points toward Mr. Trump, who became the first Republican presidential candidate to carry it since 1988. In New York City, where most of the vote has been counted as of Thursday, Ms. Harris was winning by a 38-point margin, down from Mr. Biden's 54-point margin four years ago. Cook County, Illinois (Chicago), shifted 11 points toward Mr. Trump.\n\nSome of Ms. Harris' approach had similar problems as Mr. Biden's. Her pledge to incentivize homebuilders to increase housing supply, for instance, was long-term and abstract - and wouldn't do anything for people whose rent has spiked in recent years. And some Democrats expressed frustration that her campaign hadn't stuck with populist messaging that Mr. Trump was a lackey for big business. She spent much of the end of the race focused on Mr. Trump as a threat to democracy, including in her closing argument speech on the National Mall.\n\nMr. Trump's economic messaging seemed to be particularly successful with Hispanic voters. Exit polls showed Mr. Trump carrying 45% of the Hispanic vote nationally, a 13-point jump from his 2020 performance and the high-water mark for any Republican presidential candidate in more than a half-century. The only other Republican who has topped 40% of the Hispanic vote since the TV networks began conducting exit polls in 1972 was George W. Bush in 2004.\n\nIt's impossible to know how this race would have played out if Mr. Biden had decided not to run after the 2022 midterms and allowed Democrats to hold a primary for the nomination. Few Democrats would have struggled as much to get distance from the Biden administration as his No. 2. On the other hand, a primary could have led to a repeat of the 2019 contest, in which Democratic candidates were forced to the left on a bevy of issues by activist groups - and where some of Ms. Harris' most damaging comments, which were later resurrected in attack ads by the Trump campaign, were made.\n\nThe Trump campaign spent the most money on an ad showing a clip of Ms. Harris promising to provide incarcerated transgender people access to gender-affirming care treatments. Democrats acknowledge that ad, and a follow-up ad featuring popular Black radio host Charlemagne tha God slamming her for the comments on his show, did serious damage to her, convincing some swing voters that she was \"dangerously liberal,\" as the ad said. According to an analysis shared by Ms. Harris' leading super PAC with The New York Times, that spot shifted the race 2.7 percentage points toward Mr. Trump after viewers watched it. The tagline \"Kamala Harris is for they/them. Donald Trump is for you,\" emphasized that she was focused on the wrong issues.\n\nWhile Mr. Trump appeared on scores of podcasts with large audiences of young men, Ms. Harris largely avoided them. Multiple Democrats faulted Ms. Harris for not accepting popular podcast host Joe Rogan's invitation to come to his Austin, Texas, studio for an interview. Mr. Rogan, who leans right but holds fairly heterodox political views, interviewed Mr. Trump and endorsed him on the election's eve.\n\nDemocrats don't all agree on what went wrong - and whether Ms. Harris really stood a chance at fixing things. But they all agree that something needs to change.\n\n\"There are a lot of folks that look at how Democrats are portrayed, and say, 'They care about all these other things, but they don't care about what's going on in my life,'\" says Democratic strategist Rodell Mollineau. \"There is a large chasm between what Democrats in Washington, D.C., think they are and what they stand for, and what the American people perceive them to be and what they stand for - and that's what we have to address.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

The bill is named after Laken Riley, a nursing student who was murdered at the University of Georgia in 2024 by a migrant who had been arrested multiple times for other alleged crimes. It passed the House last week with nearly one-quarter of Democrats voting for it, and has bipartisan momentum in the Senate.\n\nThe bill's Democratic backers warn that their party better get on board.\n\nDemocrats in Congress are struggling to find their footing on immigration - a big issue behind their election loss. The Laken Riley Act is a test of their repositioning.\n\n\"If we can't scrape seven or eight votes out of our caucus, that's one of the reasons why we lost,\" says Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, a Senate sponsor of the bill. \"I am very pro-immigration. That doesn't mean we are pro for every immigrant.\"\n\nSenator Fetterman's support, along with that of freshman Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona, who had voted for the bill last year in the House, set off a stampede of swing-state Democratic senators toward supporting the legislation, which needs at least seven Democrats to become law. Senate Democratic leaders, caught by surprise at the bill's rapid movement, eventually agreed to allow debate on the bill so long as they could offer changes. Democrats unveiled a list of amendments Monday night; it remains to be seen which, if any, will be adopted.\n\nThe past election showed that voters generally favored the GOP on the issue: Exit polls found that voters said they trusted former President Trump to handle immigration more than Vice President Kamala Harris, by 53% to 44%.\n\n\"Immigration was on the ballot. Being tougher on crime, on these particular issues, was on the ballot,\" says Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz of Florida, who voted for the bill.\n\nBut those same exit polls showed a muddled picture. A solid majority of voters (56% to 40%) said that unauthorized immigrants should be offered a chance at legal status rather than face deportation. That suggests that if Mr. Trump seeks widespread deportations, as he and his aides have suggested, he could face political blowback. And only 12% of voters said immigration was their top issue this campaign, with 14% naming abortion, 32% the economy, and 34% democracy.\n\nThe biggest shift in voting this election actually came from Latino voters. Mr. Trump won 46% of the Hispanic vote, a 14-point jump from 2020 and the highest share of any Republican presidential candidate since at least 1972. Exit polls showed that Hispanic voters were about evenly divided on which candidate they trusted more on immigration, but two-thirds opposed deporting most unauthorized immigrants. Latinos were no more likely to name immigration as their most important issue than non-Hispanic voters - 13% said it was their top issue, while 37% chose the economy.\n\nBut many Democrats recognize that they need to shift public perceptions of their immigration stances.\n\n\"They're recalibrating and trying to meet the electorate where the electorate is rather than where some Democrats wish the electorate was when it comes to immigration policy,\" says Fernand Amandi, a pollster who served as the top Hispanic-focused strategist on both of President Barack Obama's White House campaigns.\n\nEven many Democrats who oppose the bill say they think the party needs to closely examine what happened in the past election and acknowledge that immigration was an issue that hurt their party.\n\n\"The party is still sorting out what happened and what our messaging is going to be, and, of course, [its] positions on key issues, including immigration,\" Rep. Chuy García of Illinois, who opposed the bill, said in an interview.\n\nMr. García saw his Hispanic-majority Chicago district swing 18 percentage points to the right in the last election. He said that inflation and cost-of-living issues were the biggest reasons for the swing, but the surge of new migrants bused into his community from border states also infuriated some constituents. \"The messaging around the 'chaos border' and the surge in border crossings, along with the experience of having new arrivals in communities, made people resentful, made people think that they were being left behind one more time.\"\n\nMr. García says he thinks some of his colleagues supported the bill because they felt \"It's easier to just go along and vote for it\" than try to explain the problems with the bill to their constituents while facing attacks that they're \"favoring criminality.\"\n\nThe bill would require Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency to detain unauthorized immigrants arrested for nonviolent crimes including \"burglary, theft, larceny, or shoplifting.\" It would also empower state-level officials to sue the federal government to overturn decisions to release individual migrants - which detractors say could lead to a chaotic legal morass .\n\nICE warned lawmakers over the weekend that the the bill is an unfunded mandate that could require it to detain as many as 60,000 people, far more than the 42,000 total detention beds they currently have funding for. The agency says it would need more than $3.2 billion for enough detention beds and new agents to be able to enforce the law - or it could be forced to release tens of thousands of other immigrants it currently detains, including some deemed public safety threats. The bill doesn't currently include any funding to help ICE carry out these widespread detentions.\n\nPlenty of Democrats are rallying hard against the bill.\n\n\"The Laken Riley Act is a gross violation of civil rights for the American people writ large. And what people need to understand is that if we start rounding people up just based on that accusation of a crime, remove people's day in court, eliminate the basic constitutional rights that we are all afforded in this country - that's the beginning of the end when it comes to the erosion of our civil liberties in America,\" says Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii warns that the bill would let 10-year-old migrants \"be detained for shoplifting a piece of gum.\"\n\n\"If we're going to do immigration reform, it should be comprehensive. This bill is not it,\" she continues.\n\nDemocrats moved hard to the left rhetorically on immigration issues during the 2020 election cycle. After Joe Biden became president, the southern border saw a major surge in illegal crossings early in his administration. Then, as public concern mounted, the Biden administration looked to crack down on border security, placing new restrictions on asylum-seekers. Illegal crossings plunged.\n\nVice President Harris leaned hard into more hawkish language on border security and highlighted her fight as California attorney general against transnational gangs, while hitting Mr. Trump for torpedoing a bipartisan border security deal negotiated in early 2024 by Oklahoma GOP Sen. James Lankford.\n\nMr. Amandi, President Obama's pollster, said that pivot was \"done too late\" to help the party.\n\nIt's clear the election results jolted Democrats. Thirty-seven House Democrats voted for the Laken Riley Act last March; this time, the number rose to 48.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has also faced blowback for his immigration policies in the past. The Trump administration's family separation policy proved immensely unpopular when enacted in his first term, driving a dip in his poll numbers, and he was forced to walk it back.\n\nA number of the new votes in the House came from freshman Democrats from competitive districts. They include Rep. Suhas Subramanyam of Virginia, whose parents are immigrants and whose northern Virginia district has a large number of first-generation Americans.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Still, the congressman says he opposes most of what President-elect Trump has proposed on immigration - a sign that once the new president starts governing, Democrats might find more common ground to unite against his policies.\n\n\"I'm not in full agreement at all with Trump on his immigration plan. I think that it's not realistic to try to deport 15-million-plus people,\" Mr. Subramanyam says. \"I do think the pendulum swung quite a bit over the past four years or so on immigration, and now it might end up swinging back too far the other way.

But as Democrats look to this massive Southwestern state as their best chance to maintain Senate control, they may be disappointed again.\n\nA Republican Senate candidate hasn't lost in Texas since 1988, but Sen. Ted Cruz, considered an abrasive conservative even by some members of his own party, came close in 2018. Now, Colin Allred, a Dallas-area congressman and former professional football player, hopes to oust him in what would be one of the biggest upsets of the election.\n\nAs demographic changes in the Southwest have helped turn states like Arizona and Nevada into political battlegrounds, many analysts say that the Lone Star State is heading in the same direction. Still, while each election has brought fresh buzz that Republican dominance here is ending, that buzz has routinely evaporated on election night.\n\nThere is little evidence that this year will be any different, but Texas is now more important to Democrats' electoral hopes than ever before. Ms. Harris' party, which currently holds a functional one-seat majority in the Senate, is defending far more seats than Republicans this cycle, including several in states Mr. Trump won by big margins in 2020. With West Virginia all but certain to elect a Republican and Montana looking increasingly likely to as well, that means Democrats will need to flip a GOP seat to retain control.\n\nThe focus has become Texas. It's still a long shot, experts say. But polls show Representative Allred is within striking distance - and as such, has become Democrats' best hope to hold the Senate and their next great hope to turn Texas purple.\n\n\"Texas has emerged as their best chance to flip a Republican-held seat,\" says Jessica Taylor, the Senate and Governors editor for the Cook Political Report. \"It's been trending Democrat recently, but is it there yet? I don't think so,\" she adds. \"Those last few points in Texas are just incredibly hard to get.\"\n\nSix-year terms for senators help make each election map different from the last. The 2024 map is one that national Democrats have been fearing for a long time.\n\n\"We knew years ago that the map was going to be absolutely brutal going into this cycle,\" says Jim Manley, a Democratic strategist. \"So far that's proving to be the case.\"\n\nDemocrats ended six years of GOP control of the Senate in 2020, and two years later, won a 51-49 majority. But now the blue team is defending 19 seats, plus four held by independents who caucus with them. Republicans, meanwhile, are defending 11 seats, all in reliably red states.\n\nPolls suggest that the GOP is likely to flip two seats, replacing retiring Sen. Joe Manchin in West Virginia and ousting three-term incumbent Sen. Jon Tester in Montana.\n\nDemocratic incumbents are also facing tough races in Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania.\n\nOnly a few states have polls suggesting that Republican incumbents may be remotely in danger. In the campaign's final weeks, Democrats are pouring money into two of them: Texas and Florida.\n\nSenator Cruz leads Mr. Allred by just one point, according to a poll released last week by Emerson College and The Hill. Other recent polls have the two-term Democrat slightly further behind. But Mr. Cruz has consistently been one of the least popular Republicans in Texas.\n\n\"He's a very controversial figure, always has been, always will be,\" says Whit Ayres, a GOP pollster based in Virginia.\n\nMr. Allred, a former professional football player turned civil rights lawyer, has used his opponent's disagreeable reputation to build a big fundraising advantage. The Democrat has trumpeted his bipartisan record, and he's attacked Mr. Cruz's support for the state's abortion ban. Mr. Allred has also highlighted his opponent's infamous family vacation to Cancun, documented by reporters, during a deadly winter storm in 2021 that killed hundreds and left millions of Texans without power for days. When he returned, Mr. Cruz said the trip \"was obviously a mistake.\"\n\nAs he has campaigned, the Republican has highlighted his own burgeoning bipartisan record, and criticized his opponent on border security and transgender issues.\n\nAll told, Texas \"is the last, best hope Democrats have\" for holding the Senate, says Brandon Rottinghaus, a political scientist at the University of Houston. \"Polling is close, you have a turbocharged electorate ... and Ted Cruz remains uniquely unliked.\"\n\nThat may still not be enough, he continues. \"But it's worth the investment now.\"\n\nIt may seem like a Hail Mary this year, but Democrats' longer-term focus on Texas is understandable. For one, the state's 40 Electoral College votes are essential to Republican presidential hopes. But the state is also becoming more competitive.\n\nDemographic changes that have made the Southwest politically winnable for Democrats - namely a declining white population and a growing, young Hispanic population - are also unfolding in the Lone Star State. The state's Republican margin of victory has narrowed in the past two presidential elections, and new voter registrations hit a record high this year.\n\nBut the momentum has yet to translate to statewide victory for Democrats.\n\nIn 2016, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said her campaign \"could win Texas.\" She lost to Mr. Trump by nine points. Two years later, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke's energetic, grassroots campaign to unseat Mr. Cruz ended with a less-than-three-point defeat . While Mr. Cruz himself had said that Texas would be hotly contested in the 2020 election, both Mr. Trump and GOP Sen. John Cornyn won comfortably.\n\n\"I've been promised Texas turning blue for at least six to eight years, and it hasn't happened yet,\" says Mr. Manley, the Democratic strategist who spent over two decades working in the Senate.\n\n\"It's reasonable\" to think it will happen, he adds, \"It's maybe just not going to happen as soon as some are suggesting.\"\n\nOne factor, experts say, is that Texas is fundamentally more conservative than states like Nevada and Arizona. Indeed, while the state's urban centers have been growing bluer, the Hispanic population has been shifting in the GOP's direction.\n\nTexas is also much bigger, making it more difficult - and much more expensive - to build campaign infrastructure and name recognition for candidates. To date, the Democratic Party hasn't done much to change that.\n\n\"They're paying for ads, exposure, canvassing. They're not investing in physical things that might build infrastructure for the future,\" says Dr. Rottinghaus, the University of Houston political scientist, referring to the development of volunteer networks, fundraising resources, and slates of quality candidates for local and county elections around the state.\n\nThis contrasts with how the GOP wrested the state from Democratic control in the late 20th century. When John Tower was elected to the Senate in 1961, he became the first Republican to win statewide office since Reconstruction, but it took another three decades for the GOP to gain proper traction in the state.\n\n\"You don't go from being noncompetitive at the statewide level for cycles and cycles [to] all of a sudden being very successful,\" says Matt Mackowiak, a Republican strategist in Texas.\n\n\"It's clear [Democrats] are building something. Are they building it fast enough? Are they building it to make it strong enough to really break through? ... It doesn't seem that way to me,\" he adds.\n\nEditor's note: This article was updated on Oct. 25, the date of initial publication, to reflect that Trump and Harris events in Texas occurred as planned.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

But it's also drawing criticism that the process has been less than democratic. Having first staged a primary in which Mr. Biden faced no serious challenger, partly by design, Democratic leaders have now overwhelmingly lined up behind Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of next month's convention in Chicago.\n\nIf, as seems almost certain, Ms. Harris becomes the Democratic nominee, she will have been selected without a single primary vote cast for her or her running mate (unless she taps Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips, who mounted a lonely challenge against Mr. Biden).\n\nBefore withdrawing on Sunday, Mr. Biden had repeatedly cited the 14 million votes cast for him in state primaries as a reason to stay in the race. \"The voters - and the voters alone - decide the nominee of the Democratic Party,\" he wrote in a July 8 letter . \"Not the press, not the pundits, not the big donors, not any selected group of individuals, no matter how well intentioned.\"\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden's late-stage departure from the presidential race has led to complaints that the Democratic Party is imposing an undemocratic outcome on its voters. Will Republican criticism stick?\n\nRepublicans are trying to turn this argument against Democrats, accusing them of bypassing proper democratic processes - a scarlet letter of hypocrisy, they add, from a party that labels former President Donald Trump a threat to democracy. Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas said Mr. Biden had \" succumbed to a coup \" from party elites and donors, a phrase echoed by other Trump allies, who lament wasted GOP campaign dollars spent attacking Mr. Biden.\n\n\"They have subverted democracy [using the legal system] and are coronating the VP without a single vote,\" says Republican pollster Robert Blizzard in a text message, referring to accusations from Mr. Trump and his allies that Democrats leveraged the judicial system against the former president. Mr. Trump was convicted in May of criminal fraud by a jury in New York and faces multiple state and federal criminal indictments. \"Democrats have lost a lot of credibility on the threat to democracy argument with voters.\"\n\nOther Republicans are accusing Ms. Harris of being part of a coverup to mislead voters about Mr. Biden's health. Texas Rep. Chip Roy filed a resolution last to month calling on Biden Cabinet members to use the 25th Amendment to remove the president. \"What did Jill [Biden] know and when did she know it? What did the staff know? What did the vice president know?\" he asked Politico .\n\nBut while the recent shakeup on the Democratic ticket hasn't followed the standard playbook, it's in no way a \"coup,\" say analysts. In many ways, it speaks to how political parties operate - and how they respond to what constituents want.\n\nAfter last month's disastrous debate, polls showed most Democratic voters concluded Mr. Biden was not up to the job of beating Mr. Trump in November. Democratic leaders who pushed for a new candidate were listening to their voters, not dictating to them, says Julia Azari, a politics professor at Marquette University in Milwaukee.\n\n\"What you're seeing here is a party taking itself seriously as a representative body,\" she says. \"It would be a great thing if we could have democracy all the time, where people's viewpoints are taken into account more directly, but that isn't always feasible.\" While some voters may question the steps that led to Mr. Biden's dramatic exit, most are unlikely to pay much attention to the process, she adds.\n\nAnd while party leaders may have flexed their muscles, that's how it's supposed to work. In back-to-back election cycles, Democrats have demonstrated an ability to move quickly and overwhelmingly to try to shape outcomes in the best electoral interests of the party. During the 2020 primary race, after Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a democratic socialist, appeared on track to potentially capture the nomination, voters and party leaders in South Carolina rallied around Mr. Biden, giving him a key victory. His rivals from the party's more mainstream wing then immediately dropped out and coalesced behind him. Senator Sanders eventually conceded to Mr. Biden, who went on to defeat then-President Trump.\n\nOnce in the White House, Mr. Biden pushed to make South Carolina the first official Democratic primary in 2024, reinforcing an already huge advantage as an incumbent president running for reelection. Only Congressman Phillips ran against him, along with Marianne Williamson, a self-help author who also ran in 2020. Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., began his campaign as a Democrat but switched to become an independent candidate.\n\nThe result was that Mr. Biden had a clear path to nomination - until a majority of his own party concluded he couldn't win in November. The subsequent stampede to support Ms. Harris reflects the determination of Democrats not to be consumed by a divisive internal fight with less than four months to go, says Susan Stokes, who directs the Chicago Center on Democracy. \"There's good reasons for a party that wants to win presidential elections and other elections not to tear the party apart\" in a nomination contest.\n\nStill, Republicans may continue to raise questions about how Ms. Harris became the nominee, says Mr. Blizzard, president and founder of UpONE Insights, a GOP firm. Among other things, it could help to blunt any attacks on Mr. Trump as a threat to democracy. \"I'd expect Democrats to talk far more about saving abortion rights than saving democracy over the next few months,\" he says.\n\nOthers say Democrats are likely to continue framing Mr. Trump as a threat to democracy, highlighting his admiration for authoritarian leaders and his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. That was part of Mr. Biden's strategy in the 2022 midterms, in which Republicans fell short of expectations.\n\nTo compare Mr. Trump's record with complaints about Ms. Harris' nomination process is spurious, says Ms. Stokes. Even open primaries - where no incumbent is running - are shaped by candidates' access to money, media, and elite endorsements. \"The way that we are given candidates to choose among is not entirely democratic. But that's a rather minor point compared to a political party that will not accept a lost election,\" she says.\n\nNote: This story has been updated to correct the name of Robert Blizzard's firm.

Until now.\n\nAs the Democratic National Convention (DNC) opens Monday in Chicago, party faithful - for the most part - have a spring in their step. Their onetime standard-bearer, President Joe Biden, is heading into retirement, instead of a campaign slog that appeared doomed to defeat in November.\n\nA last-minute ticket swap has unfolded remarkably smoothly, with Democrats closing ranks around Vice President Kamala Harris. Worries about former President Donald Trump returning to the Oval Office are fueling party unity.\n\nNow, with Vice President Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket, the race against Republican nominee Donald Trump is a dead heat. Democrats suddenly have a fighting chance, and they know it.\n\nThe party's recovery has been eye-popping. In the space of a month, President Biden dropped out of the race, and Vice President Harris moved seamlessly into the nominee spot, tapping Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate. Once seen as an awkward campaigner, Ms. Harris has defied expectations, impressing even some critics. Her rally crowds number in the thousands, while a tsunami of fundraising and grassroots volunteering has followed. The momentum shift is having ripple effects: Political handicappers now say Democrats have a shot at winning control of the House, though the Senate is still an uphill battle.\n\n\"The energy is real, and it's going to continue,\" says Ann Lewis, a veteran Democratic strategist, who has attended every DNC since 1976. \"People are asking, 'Where should I go? What can I do?'\"\n\nTo be sure, voices of dissent will be in the mix. Ms. Lewis, who served as communications director in the Clinton White House, is in Chicago as co-chair of Democratic Majority for Israel, a group promoting strong U.S.-Israel ties. On the other side, pro-Palestinian groups opposed to U.S. aid to Israel amid the war in Gaza have organized a big march Monday outside the DNC, and other protest actions in Chicago are expected throughout the week.\n\nMany of those protesting, of course, may not even be Democrats, but socialists or other left-wing groups. Still, dissident voices over Gaza could ring out inside the convention itself, just as they did at many of Mr. Biden's - and now Ms. Harris' - campaign rallies. There will be a small but potentially vocal contingent of \"uncommitted\" delegates in the arena.\n\nMs. Harris has already demonstrated a different approach to handling protesters. She listens for a bit, and then sternly shuts them down. Her recent rebuke of pro-Palestinian students who interrupted her at a rally in Detroit was especially sharp. \"If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I'm speaking,\" she said, to roars of approval.\n\nDespite the potential for tumult, political observers marvel at how smoothly the party's last-minute ticket swap has unfolded. After Mr. Biden's poor June debate performance, as Democratic officials began leaning on him to leave the race, some worried it would precipitate an even more divisive power struggle. But after Mr. Biden dropped out on July 21, the party closed ranks almost immediately around Ms. Harris as his replacement, avoiding the chaos of an \"open convention\" that some had feared.\n\nIn a multiday, virtual roll-call vote of the DNC's more than 4,500 delegates, which closed Aug. 5, Ms. Harris won 99% of the vote.\n\n\"What we've seen here is that, yeah, the Democratic Party is actually way stronger than we thought,\" says Seth Masket, a political scientist at the University of Denver and author of a book that showed how the Democrats learned from their 2016 loss.\n\nMr. Biden's quick endorsement of Ms. Harris, who is Black and South Asian and would be the nation's first woman president, effectively ensured her path to the nomination - and with nary a peep from other party power centers.\n\n\"There's no Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders who's come out and said, 'No, we need to go in a different direction,'\" says William Howell, a political scientist at the University of Chicago, referring to two of the Senate's outspoken progressives and past presidential contenders. \"Everyone seems to have fallen in line and behaved well.\"\n\nThis is remarkable, he says, given the Democrats' history of warring factions - including at the party's 1968 convention, also in Chicago, which was marred by clashes between police and anti-Vietnam War protesters.\n\nIn 2024, fear over the potential return of former President Trump to the Oval Office has played a big part in the coalescing around Ms. Harris, Professor Howell says.\n\nIn a few cases, there's hedging. Three Democratic senators in tough reelection races - Jon Tester of Montana, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, and Jacky Rosen of Nevada - are skipping the convention, as are a handful of House Democrats in toss-up races. Of the three senators not coming, one - Senator Tester - has yet to endorse Ms. Harris. But the overarching show of party unity in Chicago leaves room for a few elected officials to stand back.\n\nMs. Harris has also benefited from inheriting a well-oiled Biden campaign operation - including field offices, staff, and volunteers.\n\nStill, although there are only 2 1/2 months to go until Election Day, it's too soon to say the trajectory of the race has permanently changed, says Republican pollster Whit Ayres. Much will happen between now and Nov. 5.\n\n\"Basically, what we have is an enormous burst of enthusiasm from Democrats who are relieved that they're not having to run with Joe Biden at the top of their ticket,\" he says.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

      "text": "Democrats' Lack Of Trust In Trump And Republicans Could Yield A Government Shutdown\n\nBy Richard McGahey\n\nBy Richard McGahey ,\n\nContributor.\n\nThere's a growing chance of a long government shutdown on March 14, as Democrats want President ... More Trump to stop attacking government, but don't trust he will keep any bargain he makes\n\nWith a government shutdown likely on March 14, President Donald Trump and Congress are getting serious about preventing it-or at least discussing it. Congressional procedures mean avoiding a shutdown will require bipartisan support. But some Democrats don't appear to trust Trump to keep any bargain he agrees to, making it hard to see what the solution might be.\n\nWhy is a shutdown looming? Because the regular congressional appropriations process has broken down . Congress hasn't used its regular budgeting procedures to cover all spending since 1996-29 years ago.\n\nInstead, Congress now routinely authorizes spending extensions for the fiscal year, using the previous year's specific amounts if new spending isn't agreed to. Those short-term authorizations-continuing resolutions or CRs in Congress-speak-are now the norm, with each CR finally coming after polarizing negotiations, rhetoric, and conflict.\n\nBoth parties face real negotiating challenges in the current moment, but the focus is on Republicans, who control both houses of Congress and the presidency. Republicans have an extremely slender House majority, including several very conservative members who traditionally oppose deals without deep spending cuts.\n\nIf House Republicans lose more than one vote, they cannot pass a bill. And one of their most committed budget conservatives, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, has already said he won't vote for a CR that just continues previous spending levels.\n\nMassie has been part of a larger conservative opposition to spending. That bloc's opposition has meant the House needs Democratic votes for a CR. This has resulted in bipartisan continuing resolutions maintaining spending levels, where both parties get some of what they want, largely enshrining the status quo.\n\nBut for our current looming shutdown, that kind of bipartisan agreement is extremely unlikely without substantial concessions from Trump. He is currently leaning hard on the other House budget conservatives, calling on their loyalty and reportedly threatening them with primary opponents if they don't support what he wants.\n\nAnd he may get their support. Hardcore spending opponents like Representatives Chip Roy of Texas and Andy Harris of Maryland, chair of the House Freedom Caucus, are signaling they may reverse years of consistent anti-spending voting, and agree with Trump's proposal.\n\nThat proposal is for a clean CR-simply extending current spending levels for the remainder of the fiscal year, up until September 30. But even if Trump can get the hardcore House conservatives to agree on the type of deal they've consistently opposed in the past, the bill can be filibustered in the Senate.\n\nAnd a Senate filibuster seems a very real possibility. Ordinarily, a clean CR would be welcomed by both parties, clearing the decks for two coming divisive debates: (1) raising the federal government's borrowing limit (the debt ceiling) and (2) enacting the budget for next fiscal year. Republicans will have to make deep spending cuts, most likely in Medicaid, to pay for trillions in proposed tax cuts.\n\nBut after his flurry of executive orders upon taking office, Democrats may have little confidence that Trump would keep his end of any bargain in a CR for this fiscal year. Since his inauguration, Trump has refused to spend funds already authorized by Congress. He claims his authority as president allows him to pick and choose what parts of authorized spending actually gets spent, a position at odds with current law and the views of many constitutional scholars , The New York Times explains.\n\nTrump, through Elon Musk and the newly invented Department of Government Efficiency has cancelled spending, fired workers with civil service protection and sometimes closed entire agencies like USAID through executive orders, not through congressionally authorized procedures.\n\nThe limits on presidential spending authority are currently being fought out in federal courts, where judges are ordering temporary or permanent halts to activities under Trump's executive orders. The Times reports that \"as of March 7, at least 41 of those (federal court) rulings have paused some of the president's initiatives.\"\n\nFederal court orders have been issued against Trump's government-wide funding freeze, his cutting of medical research grants from the National Institutes of Health, firing of recently hired employees at the Department of Defense and elsewhere, along with his stoppage other non-budget issues like birthright citizenship, and his decision to give Elon Musk's staff access to sensitive personal data and the federal system used to issue checks and payments.\n\nUltimately, unless Trump backs down, these issues will be decided by the Supreme Court. But Trump continues arguing he has the legal authority to cut or deny congressional authorized spending, and ProPublica reports his followers in federal agencies are refusing to comply with federal court orders even when ordered to reverse course.\n\nSo Democrats may wonder how a bipartisan CR preserving current spending levels would be honored or enforced.\n\nAccording to NBC News , Republican Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana says Democrats \"have been insistent that we include language limiting the involvement of the executive branch on spending decisions.\" And Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts says because Republicans control both chambers, \"they need to put forward a package that can pass the House and Senate\"-meaning one that Senate Democrats will agree to.\n\nOthers are blunt in their opposition. Politico quotes an unnamed \"senior Democratic lawmaker\" as saying \"At some point you've got to have a goddamn backbone. I am not giving them a blank check until September.\"\n\nAgain, a continuing resolution can pass the House with a bare majority. But a Senate filibuster means it will need 60 votes. Democrats command 47 votes, more than enough to stop the bill even if a few members (most likely politically vulnerable ones) vote the other way.\n\nAnd Trump is no stranger to shutdowns. In his first term, he presided over the longest shutdown in U.S. history-35 days-over funding for a wall on the Mexican border. He ultimately failed to get most of what he demanded, caving under public pressure from suspended government services ranging from closed national parks to disrupted air travel to disrupted services from Social Security and the IRS.\n\nTrump's aggressive bargaining style, coupled with Democrats' mistrust that he will keep any bipartisan bargain, means we could well face a long shutdown. There may be one or two very short CRs-a week or so-to save face and look for a compromise.\n\nBut Democrats are being urged to use what little power they have-through the Senate filibuster-to try and ultimately force Trump to follow the law and court rulings, commit to reopening the government, and rollback his aggressive spending and personnel cuts. Expect a rough battle, lots of fireworks, and most probably a long shutdown."

      "text": "Democrats Attack Project 2025 Agenda At DNC-But There's Still Another Plan Under Wraps\n\nDemocrats have repeatedly assailed Project 2025 at the Democratic National Convention, attacking its far-right 900-page policy agenda compiled by right-wing groups, but the conservative project is also working on a detailed policy playbook for the first 180 days of a potential Trump administration-and unlike the policy agenda that Democrats have hauled onto the convention stage, the public is unlikely to ever find out what it says.\n\nMichigan State Senator Mallory McMorrow holds up a \"Project 2025\" book as she speaks during the 2024 ... More Democratic National Convention in Chicago on August 19.\n\nProject 2025 is a multi-part agenda spearheaded by the conservative think tank Heritage Foundation that lays out a policy roadmap for the next conservative president-namely Trump-including wide-ranging policy suggestions proposing an entire overhaul of the executive branch.\n\nIn addition to a 900-page policy agenda laying out proposals and staffing efforts, Project 2025 says the \"fourth pillar\" of its plan is a \" playbook \" providing more detailed policy plans for a future Trump administration's first 180 days, which includes \"a comprehensive, concrete transition plan for each federal agency.\"\n\nUnlike Project 2025's initial policy agenda, however, that playbook has not been publicly released yet, and secretly recorded footage released in mid-August by the Centre for Climate Reporting-in which undercover journalists posing as potential donors spoke directly with Project 2025 authors-underscores that's by design.\n\nRussell Vought, an author of Project 2025's agenda who's reportedly in charge of the work on the playbook, told the journalists the playbook plans are \"very, very closely held\" and would not be publicly released, with Project 2025 officials instead just handing the materials over directly to an incoming Trump administration.\n\nMicah Meadowcroft, a Vought aide also working on Project 2025, told the undercover journalists the group was intentionally keeping the playbook a secret, including by ensuring staffers know the plans before Trump enters office so they won't have to converse over government work emails-which means journalists and the public cannot request information about the playbook through a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation did not respond to a request for comment on the footage and whether the playbook will be publicly released.\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We're launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day's headlines. Text \"Alerts\" to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here .\n\n\"There are parts of the plan that we will not share with the left,\" Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts told right-wing broadcaster Sebastian Gorka in October about Project 2025. \"Just like a good football team, we wouldn't want to tip off our playbook to the left.\" Roberts also said the aim of the playbook is to have \"executive orders, rules ready to go ... so that when we get to the end of the first calendar year\" of a second Trump presidency, \"we know that what we're doing is reclaiming this country.\"\n\nDemocratic politicians and other figures have repeatedly highlighted their concerns about Project 2025 at the Democratic National Convention, with multiple speakers bringing a physical copy of the 900-page \"Mandate for Leadership\" out on stage. Comedian Kenan Thompson hosted a segment Wednesday in which he warned everyday Americans about how its proposals could affect their lives-pointing to proposals to restrict LGBTQ rights and abortion, among others-and speakers have pointed to Project 2025 as a key reason they believe voters should oppose Trump. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz , the vice presidential nominee, said in his speech Wednesday night that while Trump and Vance have publicly claimed they \"know nothing about\" Project 2025, he knows from his experience as a high school football coach that \"when somebody takes the time to draw up a playbook, they're going to use it.\"\n\nHouse Democrats sent a letter to Roberts earlier in August asking for more details about the playbook and for it to be publicly disclosed, noting Heritage has \"conspicuously declined to publish or disclose any of the prioritized early actions that we believe would obviously be the most important parts of Project 2025.\" \"With all due respect, if the published part of [Project 2025] is so extreme that it has alarmed millions of Americans, including many conservatives, what additional controversy are you worried about?\" the lawmakers wrote regarding Roberts' unwillingness to release the playbook. \"Your secrecy invites, and perhaps concedes, the worst negative inferences.\"\n\nHow the playbook could influence a future Trump presidency. Trump has publicly disavowed Project 2025 and denied any connection to it, and he would not be under any obligation to follow its policies if elected. Vought said in the footage released Thursday he wasn't worried about Trump's attacks on Project 2025, however, saying the ex-president has \"blessed\" Vought's work and is \"very supportive of what we do.\" The right-wing official, who previously served in Trump's administration and was named as an author of the Republican National Committee's formal 2024 platform, said he maintains a good relationship with Trump and believes his team would be able to directly hand its transition playbook to the ex-president and his aides should Trump be elected. \"If a battle plan is out there that will do what he wants, there are people like me that have his trust that will be able to get it to him in whatever position we're at,\" Vought told the undercover reporters.\n\nProject 2025's original policy agenda proposes sweeping changes to the executive branch that would broadly align it with conservative ideologies and give the president more power. It would eliminate some agencies entirely, like the Departments of Education and Homeland Security, and would broadly replace career civil servants with political appointees. The agenda proposes getting rid of climate change and LGBTQ rights initiatives, ending student loan forgiveness, withdrawing federal approval for abortion drug mifepristone and imposing a baseline tax rate, among other measures. While the details of the playbook are still under wraps, Vought told the undercover journalists the group authored guidance to lawyers on Trump's authority to use law enforcement against protesters, saying it's \"important for [Trump]\n\nIn addition to its policy work, Project 2025 is also working on staffing a possible second Trump administration, including through a LinkedIn-style database for federal employee hopefuls and training programs for potential government staffers. ProPublica published many of those training videos, which are not otherwise publicly available, in which GOP figures urge future workers to be \"on board with helping implement a dramatic course correction,\" \"eradicate\" references to climate change in government materials, and avoid creating paper trails of their work.\n\nProject 2025 is part of a decades-long effort by the Heritage Foundation to advise incoming conservative presidents, with the organization saying they've provided policy agendas since Ronald Reagan's presidency. The Heritage Foundation first released its initial policy proposals through Project 2025 in 2023, but the agenda only garnered widespread attention in recent months, as the Biden and Harris campaigns have pointed to the agenda to persuade voters not to elect Trump and as Trump has spoken out against the project. Trump claimed in a July Truth Social post that he has \"nothing to do\" with Project 2025 and thinks some of its ideas are \"absolutely ridiculous and abysmal,\" and Trump campaign advisor Chris LaCivita has denounced the project as a \"pain in the ass\" to the ex-president's campaign. Project 2025 head Paul Dans stepped down from his position in August amid the criticism, and Roberts also moved back the publication of his forthcoming book proposing a \"second American Revolution\" until after the election, which has a foreword by Trump's running mate Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio. The Centre for Climate Reporting's footage of Vought and Meadowcroft is the latest in a stream of reports that have tied Trump to Project 2025 despite his attempts to distance himself from it, including noting hundreds of people from his former administration are involved with Project 2025 and a Washington Post interview with Roberts from April in which the Heritage chief said he had \"personally\" briefed Trump on the project.\n\nOne Community.

Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Friday, seemingly mocking the Senate minority leader after Schumer said Thursday he'll vote in favor of advancing a Republican bill to avert a government shutdown, even though House Democrats almost unanimously opposed the measure.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., conducts a news conference after the senate ... More luncheons in the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday, March 11, 2025. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)\n\nTrump wrote Friday on Truth Social, \"congratulations to Chuck Schumer for doing the right thing,\" calling his plan to vote for the bill a \"really good and smart move,\" taunting Schumer-who Trump insulted earlier in the week by claiming he's \"not Jewish\" and is \"a Palestinian\"-after he agreed to back the bill under threat from Republicans to blame Democrats for a shutdown if they didn't approve it.\n\nSchumer on Thursday said allowing the government to shut down would be a \"distraction\" for Democrats trying to combat Trump's agenda and would only serve to benefit Trump and his chief cost-cutter Elon Musk, though he has also criticized Republicans for choosing \"a partisan path\" and drafting the bill \"without any input\" from Democrats.\n\nThe Senate is expected to vote on the legislation Friday, hours before the shutdown deadline, after the House approved the resolution in a 217-213 vote Tuesday, with one Republican, Rep. Tom Massie, R-Ky., voting against the legislation and one Democrat, Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, voting for it.\n\nSeven Senate Democrats need to side with all 53 Republicans in order to reach the 60-vote threshold to break the filibuster and pass the resolution that would keep the government up and running through September by largely extending the existing spending plan.\n\nSenate Democrats are reportedly grappling with the decision whether to shut down the government-exposing them to attacks from Republicans and the potential even more government employees furloughed without pay could quit their jobs amid Trump's mass layoff effort-or approve a bill written by the GOP that some Democrats have said gives the Trump administration broad leeway to dictate government spending, including freezing some funds, without congressional guardrails.\n\n\"A shutdown is uncharted territory when you've got an administration that, at least in some ways, probably would welcome a shutdown because that would give the president almost unlimited power in deciding who's essential, who's nonessential, holding up agencies,\" Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, told reporters Wednesday, calling it \"a choice between two terrible alternatives.\"\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., urged Senate Democrats to vote against the measure, in defiance of Schumer, in a statement Friday that said \"Donald Trump and Elon Musk have offered the Congress a false choice between a government shutdown or a blank check.\" She said Senate Democrats should \"listen to the women,\" referring to Senate Appropriations Committee member Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and House budget committee member Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., who oppose the Republica House bill.\n\nThe House on Tuesday approved the bill that will keep fiscal year 2024 spending levels largely in place through the end of September, with a $13 billion cut to nondefense spending and a $6 billion increase in defense spending. Some Republicans who typically oppose what are known as \"continuing resolutions\"-or short-term measures to extend the existing spending plan to avert a shutdown and give Congress time to negotiate a new budget-citing a need for more cuts, said they agreed to support the bill given the Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency's efforts to reduce the federal workforce. Trump urged all Republicans to unite behind the bill, and blasted Massie repeatedly , promising to back a primary challenge against him, when he refused to cave to Trump's demands.\n\nHouse Approves Spending Bill Ahead Of Government Shutdown Deadline (Forbes)\n\nTrump Feuds With 'Grandstander' GOP Rep.

Text \"Alerts\" to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here .\n\nShortly after his speech ended, several Democratic lawmakers latched on to the \"little disturbance\" remark to attack Trump. In a post on X, Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, shared a montage of headlines about Trump's tariffs raising consumer prices and wrote : \"Can't afford groceries? Donald Trump thinks that is 'a little disturbance.'\" In a separate post from his personal handle, the Senator mocked the \"little disturbance\" saying it was a \"genuinely Soviet way to describe people not being able to afford their groceries.\" Rep. Judy Chu, D-Calif., tweeted that Trump was \"admitting his tariff trade war will raise prices and hurt American businesses.\" She then claimed the \"disturbance\" will equate to a \"cost increase of $1600 - $2000 for average American families annually.\" Rep. Jimmy Gomez, D-Calif., described the line as Trump's \"let them eat cake\" moment. In an X post , Rep. Nydia Velazquez, D-N.Y., wrote that for a \"billionaire like Trump, tariffs might be a 'little disturbance', but for working families they will be a disaster.\" Rep. Gabe Amo, D-R.I., wrote on X: \"Unbelievable that Trump just called these price hikes 'a little disturbance,'\" with an earlier post mentioning the various price increases that will be triggered by the tariffs.\n\nSen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., delivered the Democratic party's rebuttal to Trump's address , where she accused the president of trying to \"deliver an unprecedented giveaway to his billionaire friends,\" while trying to make Americans pay \"in every part of your life.\" Slotkin noted that grocery and home prices were \"going up, not down\" and Trump has \"not laid a credible plan to deal with either of those.\" Slotkin then mentioned Trump's tariffs, saying the levies on Canadian imports will \"raise prices on energy, lumber and cars,\" while starting a \"trade war that will hurt manufacturing and farmers.\" The senator then warned that people's \"premiums and prescriptions will cost more, because the math on his proposals doesn't work without going after your healthcare.\"\n\n\"Other countries have used tariffs against us for decades, and now it's our turn to start using them against those other countries. On average, the European Union, China, Brazil, India, Mexico and Canada...And countless other nations charge us tremendously higher tariffs than we charge them...They're about protecting the soul of our country. Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again,\" Trump said. The New York Times, however, pointed out that the U.S.'s tariffs on imports were in line with other developed nations like Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom and the European Union-who charge an average tariff rate between 4-5%. The U.S. has a slightly average tariff rate of 3%. On the other hand, China's average tariff rate is a much steeper 8%, while India who Trump has labeled as the \"tariff king\" in the past charges an average levy of 17%.\n\n\"Look, President Trump talked a big game on the economy, but it's always important to read the fine print. So: do his plans actually help Americans get ahead? Not even close. President Trump is trying to deliver an unprecedented giveaway to his billionaire friends. He's on the hunt to find trillions of dollars to pass along to the wealthiest in America. And to do that, he's going to make you pay in every part of your life,\" Slotkin said in her rebuttal.\n\nShortly before Trump's speech, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick appeared on Fox Business and indicated that the White House may be preparing to roll back some of the tariffs against Canada and Mexico. In the interview, Lutnick said: \"Both the Canadians and Mexicans were on the phone with me all day today trying to show that they'll do better,\" referencing Trump's complaint about cross-border flows of fentanyl into the U.S. \"And the President is listening because, you know, he's very, very fair and very reasonable. So I think he's going to work something out with them,\" Lutnick added.\n\nTrump Says In Speech Zelenskyy's Ready To Sign Mineral Deal-After Oval Office Shouting Match (Forbes)\n\nTrump Speech Interruption: Rep.

      "text": "How Democrats Fumbled Crypto And How To Recover Before 2028 Clock Runs\n\nBy Tonya M. Evans\n\nBy Tonya M. Evans ,\n\nContributor.\n\nGold coin alarm clock.Time is valuable.Business concept.3d rendering\n\nThe 2024 election delivered a stark lesson to a Democratic Party reeling from a sweeping political defeat of generational proportion: ignoring the transformative potential of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and other digital assets comes at a political cost . While the Republican party and President-Elect Donald Trump embraced bitcoin, specifically, as part of a broader platform of economic deregulation to clear the way for robust development of the web3 economy here in the United States, Democrats largely failed to engage, dismissing it as speculative, unregulated, or a vehicle for crime. The result? Crypto became a formidable political force, reshaping Congress, critical Senate races, and the White House.\n\nAs Democrats regroup, the challenge is not merely about acknowledging past strategic mistakes , leadership missteps, and misinformed rhetoric. It's about crafting a forward-looking strategy that aligns the promise of digital assets with broader progressive goals and avoids ceding the nonpartisan topic of digital asset innovation and decentralized finance to the GOP. Crypto-originally intended by Satoshi Nakamoto to be an encrypted peer-to-peer means of money transfer-represents far more than a passing financial trend; it offers unique opportunities for self-determined economic empowerment, especially in communities historically (and systemically) excluded from wealth-building. With the GOP already promising to advance pro-crypto policies as part of Trump's America First Plan (developed from his Agenda 47, a slimmed down version of Project 2025), Democrats must offer a competing-or, better yet, complimentary-vision that integrates crypto assets and blockchain technology into a framework of equity, education, and grassroots innovation beyond financial and technology siloes.\n\nThe crypto industry's influence on the 2024 election was undeniable. Super PACs like Fairshake raised $169 million, directing funds toward races critical to regulatory oversight and policy outcomes. Ads funded by crypto dollars rarely (if ever) mentioned digital assets, instead focusing on voter concerns like healthcare, inflation, and jobs. This strategic approach amplified crypto's influence while sidestepping divisive debates about crypto itself.\n\nKey Senate and House races demonstrated the power of this approach. In Ohio, $40 million in crypto-backed spending helped MAGA Republican Bernie Moreno (who said the Springfield Haitian 'pet eating' rumor was true ) to unseat Senator Sherrod Brown. Brown, a crypto skeptic and chair of the influential Senate Banking Committee overseeing the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), is a close ally of Senator Elizabeth Warren. Both have been vocal critics of cryptocurrency and strong supporters of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who was recently admonished by a federal judge for regulatory overreach and has faced judicial headwinds for some high-profile court battles.\n\nDown-ballot, progressive incumbents like Representatives Jamaal Bowman, Cori Bush, and Katie Porter were also targeted and defeated with crypto-funded campaigns that reshaped their districts' messaging.\n\nThis influence underscores a critical point: crypto is no longer a niche or fringe issue. The industry is a powerful force capable of reshaping political outcomes and driving public opinion. Democrats' reluctance to engage and convince a skeptical industry of any meaningful pivot ceded valuable ground to Republicans, who have now positioned themselves to aggressively advance an agenda to reshape not only the legislative and executive branches of federal government, but also the judicial branch through the Senate confirmation process.\n\nThe GOP's embrace of crypto is not without risks. Trump's America First plans drawn from Agenda 47, which consolidates executive power and emphasizes deregulation, could exacerbate wealth inequality and entrench systemic barriers for marginalized groups. Without thoughtful policies, the decentralization ethos of crypto may give way to new forms of exclusion, where the promise of financial freedom remains locked in inaccessible tech and finance siloes.\n\nFor Democrats, the urgency is clear. Crypto is a fast-moving space, and the next four years will be critical in shaping how it integrates into the broader economy. Without a proactive strategy, Democrats risk further alienating voters who see crypto as a path to financial empowerment and economic participation. Any further stumbles or delays will allow the GOP to solidify its narrative and policies, leaving Democrats to play catch-up and the GOP and its leadership as the face of the web3 economy, in the United States and abroad.\n\nTo reclaim their political footing, Democrats must reimagine its policies to prioritize digital asset innovation as a tool for economic opportunity. This pivot began belatedly during the truncated 2024 election cycle after Harris entered her 107-day race to the finish line. The 'don't trust, verify' crowd proved to be unmoved .\n\nSo, can Democrats truly turn the page? Here's how:\n\nThe first step is depoliticizing crypto. By framing digital assets as tools for education, innovation, and community advancement, Democrats can shift the conversation away from regulatory battles and partisan divides. This approach sets the table for grassroots opportunities rather than allowing the narrative to remain dominated by financial elites.\n\nCrypto's most significant potential lies in its ability to empower marginalized communities. For Black and Latino investors, who are disproportionately represented among crypto adopters, digital assets offer a way to bypass traditional financial barriers. Democrats could champion policies that expand access to digital tools, support minority-led crypto initiatives, and provide educational resources tailored to underserved communities.\n\nRather than focusing solely on large-scale institutional adoption, Democrats could invest in grassroots education programs that demystify crypto and blockchain technology. Partnering with state and local community organizations, as well as organizations like the National Cryptocurrency Association , to offer training and resources can ensure that the benefits of digital assets are accessible to all, not just those with existing wealth or technical expertise.\n\nClear and balanced regulations are essential. Democrats could advocate for policies that promote transparency and accountability while protecting investors from fraud and volatility. Indeed, these goals are not mutually exclusive. This includes working with industry stakeholders at every level to create guardrails that foster innovation without compromising consumer safety.\n\nThe exclusionary \"bro\" culture that exists in tech and finance, has long alienated those most in need of financial empowerment at the intersection of the two in the crypto industry. Democrats can push for greater diversity in the crypto workforce and support minority entrepreneurs through targeted grants, mentorship programs, and access to capital. This ensures that the promise of crypto extends beyond a narrow demographic.\n\nFor crypto to truly serve as \"the people's money,\" its adoption must be accompanied by protections for other fundamental freedoms. Privacy, speech, and economic mobility are essential pillars of a thriving democracy, and crypto policy must reflect these values. Democrats have a unique opportunity to connect the principles of decentralization and self-sovereignty with a broader progressive vision that prioritizes equity and inclusion.\n\nBy tying crypto to these freedoms, Democrats can reclaim the narrative and position themselves as champions of innovation that works for everyone-not just the privileged few.\n\nThe next four years are pivotal for Democrats; the next two are even more consequential for the checks and balances of legislative power. The party has an opportunity to align crypto's economic potential with a vision of justice and equity that serves all Americans. By shedding anti-crypto partisanship, investing in grassroots education, and championing inclusive innovation, Democrats can transform a liability into a strength. This shift can end divisive rhetoric and pave the way for policies that empower communities, drive web3 opportunities, and build an economy that is secure, inclusive, and decentralized."

      "text": "A Platform For Democrats\n\nBy John C. Goodman\n\nBy John C. Goodman , Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Dr. Goodman offers market-based solutions to public policy problems.\n\nBy John C. Goodman ,\n\nContributor.\n\nA fraternity house could be a model for expanding urban housing.\n\nNow that the Republicans have completed their convention and chosen their presidential candidate, more than one columnist has asked, \"What big ideas do the Democrats have to offer?\"\n\nThere actually are some big reforms that are sensible and consistent with Democratic values - including a commitment to housing, health care, jobs and education. But unlike most of the Democrats' current policy ideas, these suggestions involve less, not more, government regulation.\n\nFree the housing market. One of the main reasons for homelessness in America is that low-income families have been priced out of the housing market. Economists from across the political spectrum agree that a major reason for that is excessive regulation -including laws that make it difficult to convert vacant office buildings into residences.\n\nOne of the least expensive forms of housing is the boarding house , which you see in old western movies. You can also find them on college campuses, where they are called \"fraternity and sorority houses.\" These structures typically have a single room for living, with common areas for restrooms and dining.\n\nUnfortunately, this form of housing is highly regulated in most cities-if not outlawed altogether. Many cities also outlaw mobile homes and other less expensive housing options. This should change.\n\nLet seniors go back to work. Most people begin collecting Social Security benefits before they reach the full retirement age. Yet if they decide to return to the labor market, even at a part-time job, they can only earn $22,320 a year without penalty. Beyond that sum, for every $2 they earn they lose $1 of Social Security benefits. That's a 50 percent tax on top of income and payroll taxes, as well as the Social Security benefit tax. Indeed, average-income seniors can end up in a 90 percent tax bracket!\n\nAbolishing this earning penalty would be a win-win for everybody, including the Treasury. As senior workers re-enter the labor market, they and their employers would pay additional income and payroll taxes-more than offsetting the restored benefit payments.\n\nLiberate Medicaid. When people enroll in Medicaid, their visits to the emergency room increase, on average, by 40 percent. One reason is that Medicaid reimbursement rates are below the rates charged at walk-in clinics and urgent care centers. Even if the clinic accepts Medicaid's payment (which some do), it is unlikely to be located in the areas of the city where Medicaid patients live. Many doctors won't take any new Medicaid patients , and those that do also don't locate in the areas of the city where Medicaid patients live.\n\nThe overuse of the ER is bad for everyone. The average wait time at Parkland Hospital (a safety net facility) in Dallas is almost 6 hours!\n\nSo why not let low-income families buy medical care the way they buy food? At the supermarket, they combine food stamps with out-of-pocket money and pay the same market prices everyone else pays. If they do that today with medical care, it's a criminal act. Under the reform proposed here, they could still go to the emergency room and lose a day's pay. Or they could save time and money at a MinuteClinic.\n\nWe should also give low-income families access to 24/7 primary care. Direct primary care (DPC) doctors give patients their cell phone numbers so that they can get medical advice at nights and on weekends instead of immediately going to the ER. At AtlasMD in Wichita, the cost is $50 a month for a mother and $10 for a child for all primary care.\n\nMedicaid should deposit funds for primary care into Health Savings Accounts for low-income families, allowing them to purchase care directly or pay a monthly fee to a DPC doctor of their choice.\n\nLet every school become a magnet school. It's hard to find a Democratic politician these days who supports school choice. That's because teachers' unions hate the idea and they are large backers of Democratic candidates. But I am not aware of any teacher union complaint about the oldest and largest system of school choice we have: our magnet schools .\n\nInitially, these were the creation of federal judges. Although some critics complain that school choice will lead to more segregation, magnet schools were created to promote integration by inducing white kids from the suburbs to return to inner city schools. To do that, the magnet schools had to compete with, and be better than, the suburban schools.\n\nCurrently, most public school teachers are teaching whoever happens to be living in the neighborhood. Most charter school teachers are teaching whoever happened to win a lottery. In both cases, teachers have to be all things to all students - regardless of their differences.\n\nMagnet schools, by contrast, can specialize-for example in such programs as mathematics, natural sciences, fine arts or even technical/vocational/agricultural education. Importantly, magnet schools can choose which students to enroll - just like colleges.\n\nEncourage independent contracting. The idea that people will work 40 hours a week at an employer's place of business dominates an enormous amount of labor law. Even the minimum wage law is premised on the idea that people will work in continuous units called \"hours.\" But millions of people have decided that's not the way they want to work. Public policy should accommodate their preferences.\n\nCritics claim that Uber drivers are missing out on employee benefits they would get if they were employees. Have they forgotten about the Affordable Care Act? For a typical Uber driver, the premium for health insurance in the (Obamcare) exchange is zero. By contrast, the average cost of family coverage provided by employers these days is almost $24,000 .\n\nVirtually all economic studies of the matter find that employee benefits are dollar-for-dollar substitutes for money wages. So, if an Uber driver became an employee and had employer-provided health insurance, he would experience a huge reduction in money income.\n\nThere are, of course, other employee benefits and the correct public policy is to level the playing field. When it comes to retirement savings, for example, independent contractors should get the same tax advantages they would get if they were employees.\n\nThere are many other potential reforms for Democrats to discover so long as they remember: the greatest potential for impactful reform begins with the need to change bad government policies."

      "text": "House And Senate Fundraising Battle: Democrats Narrowly Outraise GOP In Fight For Congress\n\nDemocrats are going into the last weeks before Election Day with a slight cash lead over Republicans as the two parties have been neck and neck in fundraising to control the House and Senate, recent federal filings show-with individual Democratic Senate candidates taking a bigger lead.\n\nThe US Capitol building as night falls on December 17, 2019 in Washington, DC.\n\nThe two main national committees raising money to elect Democrats to the House and Senate outraised the two main Republican committees as of Oct. 16, the latest date for which filings are available-raising $548.5 million in total this election cycle to Republicans' $489 million and slightly widening their lead from September, when Democrats had outraised the GOP by $49.1 million.\n\nThat's largely because of Democrats' advantage in fundraising for House races-where the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has outraised its GOP counterpart by $78.8 million-while the National Republican Senatorial Committee has raised around $19.4 million more than the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\n\nThe main super PACs focused on electing Democrats to Congress, House Majority PAC and Senate Majority PAC, have also raised more than their GOP counterparts, with a combined $621.3 million fundraising haul as of Oct. 16 versus $515 million raised by the GOP's Congressional Leadership Fund and Senate Leadership Fund.\n\nDemocrats' Senate super PAC outraised Republicans'-taking in $329.7 million through mid-October to the GOP's $282.2 million -and while the House GOP PAC, Congressional Leadership Fund, narrowly outraised Democrats' House PAC prior to October, the Democrats' House Majority PAC now has a $58.8 million lead over its Republican counterpart ( $291.7 million to $232.9 million ).\n\nDemocrats' official committees-which can give directly to candidates and coordinate with their campaigns, unlike super PACs-reported having more cash on hand than Republicans, with $77.7 million in cash as of Oct. 16 while Republicans had $57.3 million .\n\nRepublican super PACs had more cash than Democrats as of mid-October, however, reporting $150.8 million to Democrats' $135.5 million .\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We're launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day's headlines. Text \"Alerts\" to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here .\n\n$1.7 billion . That's how much Democrats have reported raising in total through Oct. 16 between their two major national committees and two super PACs, beating out Republicans' overall fundraising total of $1.4 billion .\n\nHow these totals have changed since they were last reported. The FEC filings released Thursday are the last figures released before Election Day, so it won't be clear how much parties have raised between Oct. 17 and Nov. 5 until after the election.\n\nWhile Democrats are more evenly matched with Republicans at the national level, the party has a greater fundraising advantage for Senate candidates facing close elections, as Democrats try to keep control of the chamber. FEC filings show the Democratic candidates in the top 10 most competitive Senate races this cycle-in Arizona, Florida, Maryland, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin-have all outraised their Republican opponents, based on their official campaign committees. The four races rated \"toss-ups\" by the Cook Political Report have particularly high fundraising gaps: Democratic Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown has raised more than three times the amount of Republican opponent Bernie Moreno ($84.6 million to $24.2 million), while in Michigan, Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin's Senate run has attracted $45.8 million in donations-more than four times the $9.7 million her opponent, Mike Rogers, has raised. In Wisconsin, Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin took in $52.3 million as of Oct. 16, nearly twice as much as opponent Eric Hovde, and Pennsylvania incumbent Sen. Bob Casey has raised $46.1 million to GOP rival Dave McCormick's $27.7 million. The fundraising also isn't necessarily in line with the polls: In Montana, for instance, incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Tester is projected to narrowly lose his seat, even as he's raised more than three times as much as opponent Timothy Sheehy ($88.1 million to $26.2 million). Despite Democratic candidates' higher fundraising overall, some Republicans are going into the last weeks before Election Day with more cash on hand. That includes Texas Sen. Ted Cruz ($9.6 million in cash vs. $2.5 million for Democratic challenger Rep. Colin Allred), Arizona candidate Kari Lake ($4.5 million vs. $2.8 million for Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego) and GOP candidates in Michigan, Wisconsin and Florida.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee-which boosts Democratic candidates nationwide, not just at the congressional level-has also outraised the Republican National Committee, receiving $538.8 million through Oct. 16 versus $390.2 million raised by the RNC. Democrats also spent more of their cash, however, so the RNC had a cash advantage as of mid-October, holding $47.8 million in cash on hand as compared with $30 million for the DNC.\n\nThe amount that Democrats and Republicans are taking in for all congressional candidates across the country is roughly comparable to the nine-figure sums being raised just by Harris and former President Donald Trump . NBC News first reported in October that the Harris campaign and other affiliated groups have raised more than $1 billion just since President Joe Biden dropped out of the race in July, and the campaign has reported raising $997.2 million on its own as of Oct. 16. (That includes the amount raised by the Biden campaign before he dropped out, as the campaign committee was then renamed for Harris and she received all the funds.) The Trump campaign has only raised $388 million as of mid-October-and Harris also has Trump beaten when it comes to their cash piles as well, with $118 million in cash on hand as of Oct. 16 versus Trump's $36.2 million.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans are in a tight battle for control of Congress this election cycle, as Republicans hold only a nine-seat majority in the House and Democrats narrowly have control of a divided Senate. FiveThirtyEight's polling average shows Americans are divided on which party they want to have control of Congress, with 46.4% on average favoring Democrats as of Thursday while 45.9% prefer the GOP. Democrats face an unfavorable Senate map in November, as vulnerable Democrats Tester and Brown fight to hold their seats in conservative-leaning Montana and Ohio. The left's only hope of picking up any seats appears to be in Florida and Texas, where Sen. Rick Scott and Cruz face strong Democratic challengers but are still widely favored to win.\n\nOne Community. Many Voices.

      "text": "Democrats Can Reconnect With Black Voters On DEI Issues, Survey Finds\n\nBy Marybeth Gasman\n\nBy Marybeth Gasman ,\n\nContributor.\n\nAfrican American man looking at voting booths.\n\nA substantial majority (67%) of Black respondents believe Democratic Party leaders should actively defend diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives as part of their broader resistance to President Donald Trump's anti-DEI stance , a recent survey by the 2 040 Strategy Group finds . Just 18% of Black respondents supported the current strategy for opposing Trump's policy agenda. The poll also showed that 1 in 4 Black voters are skeptical that Democrats will effectively connect with the Black community in the future. 1\n\nThis skepticism is rooted in real policy concerns. As Alvin Tillery , Northwestern University professor and founder of the 2040 Strategy Group, explains, \"Trump's executive order on DEI is not merely symbolic. It has direct consequences for Black workers and students.\" He noted, \"Trump's executive order ending \"wasteful\" DEI programs in the federal government puts a target on the backs of Black employees-who make up 18% of the federal workforce. Many Black Americans who once found access to the middle class through federal employment or even college now find that the door has been shut .\"\n\nDo you approve of Trump's actions as president?\n\nRegarding Trump's overall support, the survey found that only 25% of Black voters approved of him. This is in comparison to 47% of the electorate at large. Additionally, 64% of surveyed Black Americans believed that Trump's political agenda is hostile to people of color. Even self-identified Trump supporters were evenly split (41% agree vs. 41% disagree) on this question.\n\nDespite their disapproval of Trump, many Black Americans remain unconvinced that Democrats can effectively counter his policies. Tillery points out, \"Overall, Black Americans agree (74%-10% margin) that DEI programs are important to achieve full equality in the United States. 71% agree (vs. 11% disagree) that Trump's attacks on DEI make race relations worse. Majorities also agree that Trump's attacks on DEI are a threat to their well-being (63% agree vs, 18% disagree).\"\n\nAlvin Tillery, faculty member at Northwestern University and founder of the 2040 Strategy Group\n\nTo bridge this gap, Tillery emphasizes that Democrats must engage \"credible messengers\" who can articulate the specific harms of the Trump-Republican agenda, particularly its attacks on DEI. He believes centralizing these issues to their messaging would allow Democrats to reconnect with their base and clearly define the contrast between the two parties.\n\nIn a conversation with Tillery about the survey, I asked him what specific steps Black voters want the Democratic Party to take in defending DEI. He responded, \"Black voters are demanding more than rhetorical support for DEI-they want tangible action in two key areas:\n\nBeyond DEI, I also asked Tillery what drives Black voters' skepticism about the Democratic Party's ability to connect with their community. He identified several factors, including a lack of policy follow-through, weak opposition to Trump's policies, and youth disengagement. \"Many Black voters feel that Democrats campaign on racial justice but fail to deliver concrete policy wins-particularly in economic opportunity, police reform, and voting rights,\" he explained. Tillery added, \"Black voters overwhelmingly oppose Trump's attacks on DEI (71% believe they worsen race relations), but many believe Democrats have not been aggressive enough in countering these moves.\" Furthermore, he noted, \"Young Black voters are significantly less likely than older generations to believe the Democratic Party cares about their concerns.\"\n\nGiven how voting changed among young people in the 2024 election , I asked Tillery about the role of young Black voters in shaping the future of DEI advocacy within the Democratic Party and how their views differ from older generations. He explained, \"Young Black voters are central to the future of DEI advocacy but are less convinced that the Democratic Party is the vehicle for change.\" He noted that young Black voters want to see broader civil rights framing, have lower trust in the Democratic Party, and are disenchanted with politics. More specifically, he shared, \"Young Black voters see DEI as part of a larger fight for racial justice, environmental justice, and wealth equity. They tend to connect it with movements like police reform, reparations, and housing justice rather than just workplace policies.\" He added, \"Older Black voters (50+) view the Democratic Party as a flawed but necessary institution, while younger Black voters are more inclined to seek change through grassroots movements and economic activism. This is why enthusiasm for the Democratic Party drops 30% among younger and less engaged voters.\" Of concern to Tillery is that \"the enthusiasm gap among younger Black voters could be politically fatal for Democrats in 2026 and 2028 if they fail to demonstrate real investment in DEI and economic justice.\"\n\nFinally, I asked Tillery how Democrats could counter Trump's executive order on DEI in a way that resonates with Black voters and motivates turnout in 2026 and 2028. He outlined a multilayered strategy:\n\nThe stakes are high, and the road ahead for Democrats is not without obstacles. So, what can they do to regain trust and mobilize Black voters in 2026 and beyond? Democrats are starting to mount small fights, but, according to Tillery, \"the party will need to hit DEI messages even harder to keep Black voters on their side.\"\n\n1 This analysis is based on a poll of 979 Black respondents and was collected between February 5 and 7, 2025. All estimates are weighted on age, sex, income, education, and partisanship to estimate a nationally representative sample of Black adult residents. The margin of error for whole-sample point estimates is approximately +/- 3 percent, larger for subsets.

      "text": "Here's How Democrats Could Pick A New Nominee As Joe Biden Drops Out\n\nPresident Joe Biden decided to bow out of the 2024 race on Sunday, setting off an unprecedented and potentially chaotic process with just weeks before delegates are set to convene in Chicago to formalize their nominee-though Vice President Kamala Harris will likely have an advantage.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden pauses while speaking during a NATO 75th anniversary celebratory event at ... More the Andrew Mellon Auditorium on July 9, 2024 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)\n\nBiden endorsed Harris on Sunday, likely giving her a major head start over any other potential nominees .\n\nRep. James Clyburn , D-S.C., was the first major figure to publicly suggest the party could survey potential Biden replacements by conducting a \"mini-primary,\" a proposal echoed by New York Times columnist Ezra Klein and longtime Democratic political consultant James Carville .\n\nIf the party doesn't coalesce behind a new nominee before the convention, the event-typically a formality with an outcome predetermined by primaries-could become a political cage match not seen in decades as hopefuls compete for the 4,700 Democratic delegates who will vote to select the nominee.\n\nThe mini-primary process would precede the convention and its exact process is not yet clear, but it could involve a campaign blitz between Biden-replacement hopefuls via a series of town halls, public forums, speeches, debates and other events designed to familiarize voters and delegates with the potential new nominee on a fast-tracked schedule (though a mini-primary is unlikely to happen if Biden drops out and endorses a successor).\n\nDemocrats could conduct an open convention , leaving Biden's delegates free to vote for whoever they please at the convention-though since Biden anointed Harris as his preferred successor, his delegates could be inclined (but not legally required) to vote for her.\n\nSimilar to an open convention, Democrats could hold a brokered convention , in which all delegates would show up to the convention uncommitted, subject to back-room deals \"brokered\" by local and state party bosses along with elected officials, which historically have led to dozens of rounds of voting (brokered conventions were regular practice before the party changed its convention rules in the 1970s to require delegates commit to the candidate who wins their state's primary).\n\nConvention rules state that the 4,000 \"pledged\" delegates \"shall in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them,\" meaning they're expected, but not legally required, to vote for Biden. If no candidate secures a majority of delegate votes on the first ballot, pledged delegates, along with the 700 \"unpledged\" delegates, can vote for whoever they please on the second ballot. Unpledged delegates do not vote in the first round.\n\nThe Democratic National Convention is set for Aug. 19-22 in Chicago. Democrats are planning to formalize the nominee in a virtual roll call during the first week of August, a move that was initially planned to ensure Biden was on the ballot in Ohio, which previously required parties to select their nominees 90 days before the Nov. 5 election. Ohio has since changed its law, but Democrats are expected to go forward with the virtual roll call as planned.\n\nHarris is widely considered the most likely option to replace him as the nominee for a multitude of reasons, beyond the crucial endorsement from Biden. She is already on his ticket, meaning she can seamlessly take over his campaign war chest, allowing the party to avoid the complicated process of dispersing the funds to another candidate, as it would legally be required to do. She also benefits from name recognition, and most polls show her outperforming other Biden replacement options. Clyburn and former Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, have suggested Harris replace Biden if he drops out. Ryan explicitly called for that scenario in a Newsweek op-ed earlier this month. Clyburn has said he supports Biden, but also floated the idea of a \"mini-primary,\" telling CNN he would \"absolutely\" support such a process, though he would back Harris in the truncated campaign if that were to occur. Clyburn emphasized that the party should \"bolster\" Harris and should not \"do anything\" to prevent her from replacing Biden, if he drops out.\n\nCarville, who was among the first high-profile Democrats to call on Biden to step aside in the race in the wake of his disastrous June 27 debate performance, warned that Democrats risk appearing as if they rigged the process and chose a nominee without public input if they don't engage in some form of a mini-primary if Biden drops his bid. \"We're not going to do that,\" he wrote in The New York Times. \"We're going to nominate a new ticket in a highly democratic and novel way, not in the backrooms of Washington, D.C., or Chicago.\"\n\nIn addition to Harris, some names commonly floated as Biden replacements include Democratic governors Gavin Newsom of California, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, J.B. Pritzker of Illinois, Kentucky's Andy Beshear and Colorado's Jared Polis. Whitmer has disavowed calls for her to run in Biden's place and denied a Politico report that she told Biden's campaign he couldn't win Michigan after the debate. Newsom, in interviews immediately after the debate, expressed his unwavering support for Biden, telling reporters in the spin room \"I will never turn my back on President Biden,\" as chatter about the prospect of him replacing Biden was already underway before the debate even ended. Pritzker and Beshear have offered tempered criticism of Biden and urged him to do more to reassure the party and voters he is up to the job after his debate performance, though neither explicitly called on him to step aside in the race.\n\nEvery Big Name Urging Biden To Drop Out: Adam Schiff Joins 19 Other Democrats In Congress (Forbes)\n\nThese Are The Likely Democratic Presidential Candidates If Biden Drops Out (Forbes)\n\nWhat Happens If Biden Drops Out?

More Committee (DNC) headquarters on November 16, 2023 in Washington, DC. Security fencing remains in place following an outbreak of violence at an overnight protest at the DNC calling for a cease fire in the Israel-Hamas war. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)\n\nThe Democratic National Committee (DNC) recently met at the Gaylord Hotel, just outside of D.C., to elect new leadership they hope helps the Democratic Party counter President Donald J. Trump.\n\nThe relatively sleepy meeting concluded with the election of Ken Martin as party chairman.\n\nMartin, former chair of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, campaigned on a platform focused on strengthening state party infrastructure. His advocacy priorities include healthcare access, childcare, labor rights, and climate change. He also aims to build lasting multi-racial and multi-generational coalitions, both in rural and urban areas, and to establish a clear distinction between Democrats and Republicans.\n\n\"A lot of people in this country right now are going to need us to walk and chew gum at the same time,\" Martin told The Nation shortly after becoming DNC chairman . \"Meaning we're going to have to fight the extremes of Donald Trump. While we make a case in both red and blue states about why they should trust us with their votes.\"\n\nFor Democrats, countering Trump will prove to be far more complex than what simply installing new leadership can achieve. The party and its leaders should be leading the resistance. Unfortunately, two weeks into the second Trump presidency, many critics believe they are still searching for their footing.\n\nMartin assumes the helm of the DNC amid a deluge of Trump executive orders, accompanied by seemingly well-planned visuals of Trump administration officials, and strategically placed positive advertising by the newly minted president and his allies during the biggest NFL games of the season.\n\nThe party is also facing a fundamental reckoning regarding what it stands for, who it represents, and how it plans to reconnect with the voters who abandoned it in 2024. At the core of this debate is a battle between establishment figures and the party's progressive wing, both of whom claim to offer the best strategy for taking on Trump.\n\nThe establishment, led by party donors and figures with deep ties to the DNC infrastructure, argues that a return to pragmatism and broad-based coalition-building guarantees electoral success. The progressive wing, emboldened by the grassroots energy of activists and younger voters, believes that a more aggressive, populist approach is necessary to galvanize turnout and win back working-class voters.\n\nThe challenge is not just ideological-it's practical. Trump and his allies are executing a sophisticated, fast-paced communications strategy that keeps his base engaged and his opponents perpetually reactive, often a couple of days or hours behind. Each executive order, each high-profile speech, and each carefully staged appearance forces Democrats onto the defensive, scrambling to respond rather than dictating the terms of the political debate or presenting some of their solutions to the problems plaguing the American people.\n\nThe result is a party that often appears fractured and unfocused, struggling to present a coherent alternative vision to voters.\n\n\"Trump said he didn't know what Project 2025 was, but now he's writing it into law,\" Martin said in a statement.\n\nWhile doubling down on Trump's connection to Project 2025 has become a helpful tool for Democrats, it might fall short in their quest to reach Democratic voters who sat out the 2024 election.\n\nMeanwhile, the Republican Party-despite its internal divisions-has largely fallen in line behind Trump , recognizing the power of a unified message and an aggressive media strategy. The GOP's ability to control the narrative, amplify new media outlets sympathetic to their cause, and relentlessly focus on cultural grievance has allowed them to maintain political momentum despite the chaos and controversy of decisions such as closing the United States Agency for International Development via an executive order.\n\nFor Democrats, the road ahead requires more than just opposition. It demands a clear, coherent, and concise articulation of their values. The party must communicate not only what it stands against but also what and who it stands for. At a time when Black History Month celebrations are being banned and corporations are rolling back programs designed to level the playing field for Black Americans and others, the party should remember that the vast majority of Black voters supported Democrats in the last election, despite a lack of robust outreach.\n\nBeyond focusing on their base voters, the party should also make issues of economic justice, healthcare reform, affordable housing, and financial concerns more than just talking points. These key issues must be framed in a way that resonates with the lived experiences of everyday voters, many of whom feel left behind by the party, according to recent polls.\n\nWith the winter meeting now behind them, many Democratic Party insiders are advocating for investments in new infrastructure that supports state-level grassroots organizers and a new class of strategic thinkers leading the national agenda in Washington, D.C..\n\nIn light of Kamala Harris's recent defeat , these younger, grassroots-oriented party members want to emphasize the importance of addressing tangible kitchen table issues and their unique intersections with race, ZIP code, and gender. For them, winning the White House in 2020 was a crucial step, but the lack of a concerted effort to address voter frustration and address disconnects from coveted Democratic base voters have diminished Democrats' stature in state legislatures.\n\nThis makes federal-level wins hard to sustain.\n\nAs the new Democratic leadership takes shape, the question remains: can Democrats rise to the occasion? Can they move beyond being the party of anti-Trump and forge an identity that inspires voters? Can they create a movement that is as disciplined and effective as their opponents?\n\nThe answers to these questions will determine not just the party's future, but the future of American democracy itself."

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom received backlash online for his Friday comments about the Democratic Party when he called its brand \"toxic\" and criticized some in the party who are unwilling to \"have a conversation\" with their Republican counterparts during an interview with comedian and talk show host Bill Maher .\n\nA spokesperson for the governor's office directed Newsweek to Newsom's comments during the Maher interview.\n\nNewsom, a Democrat, has attempted a fresh approach to political divisiveness in the aftermath of President Donald Trump 's 2024 election victory, which saw Republicans take control of the White House and both houses of Congress .\n\nLaunching the This Is Gavin Newsom podcast in late February, the governor has positioned his venture as a bipartisan exploration, with guests including conservative activist Charlie Kirk and former Trump strategist Steve Bannon as well as popular left-wing figures such as Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and New York Times opinion columnist Ezra Klein.\n\nNewsom is also believed to be a contender for the Democratic nomination for the 2028 presidential election. However, he hasn't yet expressed his intention to run.\n\nNewsom sat down with Maher on Friday during a segment of HBO 's Real Time with Bill Maher and addressed his podcast, saying he found it bewildering that some members of his party refuse to even speak with Republicans and are instead content to remain in \"echo chambers.\"\n\n\"These guys are crushing us. The Democratic brand is toxic right now,\" Newsom said.\n\n\"We had a high watermark two weeks ago, and that was a CNN poll, at 29 percent favorability. It's dropped in an NBC poll to 27 percent,\" the governor said. \"It's one thing to make noise but you also have to make sense.\"\n\nNewsom defended his podcast as a chance to have the conversations the Democratic Party refuses to have and \"not take cheap shots.\" He also criticized Democrats for being \"more judgmental\" and not owning up to \"cancel culture.\"\n\nHe insisted that the party has \"got to mature,\" and that Democrats \"need to own our mistakes...own what's wrong with our party.\"\n\nNewsweek reached out to Newsom's podcast team on Saturday afternoon for comment.\n\nTime to break out of our echo chambers. pic.twitter.com/KKn8zRDLEk\n\nNewsom's favorability rating has dropped since launching his podcast, according to a poll by Capitol Weekly, which describes itself as nonprofit outlet covering California politics.\n\nPolling in early February found Newsom had a 52 percent favorability, but by early March, that had dropped to 47 percent. The poll showed 1,000 voters in the state three clips from Newsom's podcast and asked them their opinion.\n\nThe clips featured Newsom and Kirk discussing the use of pronouns in meetings and the term \"Latinx,\" Newsom's objections to trans women competing in women's sports and Kirk joking with Newsom about California's school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nRepresentative Ro Khanna, a California Democrat , wrote on X, formerly Twitter: \"With respect, [ Gavin Newsom ] the Democratic party is not 'toxic.' This is not the time to join the chorus in bashing our party. The rage should be about what Trump is doing TODAY. Let's share what our party has done & offer a forward vision for the future.\"\n\nCalifornia Democratic state Representative Sam Liccardo wrote on X: \"Newsom calling the Democratic brand 'toxic' resembles the defendant who pleads for a judge's mercy as an 'orphan' after killing his parents. I should know: [ Gavin Newsom ]⁩ & CA Dem Party endorsed my opponent last year...and I won by double digits.\"\n\nJennifer Sey, the founder of XX-XY Athletics , wrote on X: \"Don't fall for anything [ Gavin Newsom ] says. He talks about the toxicity of [ The Democrats ] and how bad cancel culture is as if he has nothing to do with it. He sits there like the reasonable one willing to call the Dems out on why the party is toxic. But he's not.\"\n\nShe continued: \"As the leader of the biggest state, the most 'progressive' state, and someone who has held power in that state in some capacity for over 20 years, he's responsible. He's implemented the worst 'harm reduction' policies leading to rampant open air drug use and homelessness and crime and overdoses in CAs major cities, the most insane policies around 'trans' kids punishing teachers who refuse to lie and keep secrets from parents, he oversaw the most draconian COVID policies keeping schools closed for a year and a half and shuttering small businesses. This man is pathological. Don't buy the shit he's shoveling.\"\n\nPolitical commentator Keith Olbermann wrote on X: \"Nothing worse than politicians like [ Gavin Newsom ] and dyspeptic MCs who thought it was them and not their guests like [ Bill Maher ] mistaking their own collusion with the fascists as 'insight.' The toxicity is YOU, boys. You're finished.\"\n\nConservative activist Riley Gaines posted a clip of Newsom's interview and wrote on X: \"Gavin Newsom's 'rebrand' isn't fooling anyone...at least no one who has been paying attention.\"\n\nFormer presidential candidate Andrew Yang wrote on X: \"The odds of Gavin Newsom running for President are approximately 100%.\"\n\nNewsom's podcast releases a new episode every week.\n\nUpdate 3/29/25, 8 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with additional information.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\n\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\n\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\n\nPeter Aitken is a Newsweek Politics Editor based in New York.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nDemocrat James Malone is projected to win a special election for a state Senate seat in Pennsylvania in a district that President Donald Trump won by 15 points in November.\n\nThe race was too early to call late Tuesday, but with 99 percent of the estimated vote counted, Malone, the mayor of East Petersburg, was leading his Republican opponent, Lancaster County Commissioner Josh Parsons, by fewer than 500 votes, according to returns posted by the Pennsylvania secretary of state.\n\nDemocrats , however, declared victory, with Ken Martin, the chair of the Democratic National Committee , congratulating Malone on his \"shocking, historic special election victory in Senate District 36.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Parsons wrote on X, formerly Twitter , that he was \"disappointed in the numbers\" and that \"it appears we will come up a little short.\"\n\nNewsweek has contacted Malone and Parsons' campaigns for comment via email.\n\nThe candidates were running to fill a vacancy in northern Lancaster County after state Senator Ryan Aument, a Republican, stepped down to take a job working for U.S. Senator Dave McCormick.\n\nDemocrats flipping the seat would be a significant upset after Trump carried the conservative-leaning district with 57 percent of the vote in November.\n\nDemocrats sought to present the result of the special election as a rebuke to the Trump administration's White House agenda, which has included mass layoffs of government employees, the dismantling of agencies and fears about possible cuts to popular programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nEven if Democrats ultimately flip the special election seat, the Pennsylvania state Senate will remain comfortably in Republican control. The GOP will control 27 of the 50 seats if Malone is officially declared the winner.\n\nMalone told local news station WGAL-TV that the result was because \"everyday voters are not liking what they're seeing in the federal level.\"\n\nHe said his campaign worked to ensure voters were aware he was running, after Aument had run unopposed in the last election in 2022.\n\n\"One of the biggest things we did was go from the ground, reach out to everybody and let them know what we were running, why we're running,\" Malone said. \"And I think that made all the difference.\"\n\nIn a separate special election in western Pennsylvania, Democrat Dan Goughnour beat Republican Chuck Davis to win a seat that became vacant after the death of Democratic state Representative Matthew Gergely in January. Goughnour's win means Democrats maintain control of the state House by a single seat.\n\nMartin said in a statement that the majority means state House Democrats \"can stand up to Trump's mayhem in Washington, defend Governor Josh Shapiro from constitutional amendments to bypass him in the legislature, and continue to expand job opportunities, strengthen schools, and create safe communities in Pennsylvania.\"\n\nHe added: \"Expanding the Democratic Party begins in the states and down-ballot wins like Rep.-elect Goughnour's offer a powerful rebuke of Trump and Elon Musk 's MAGA agenda.\"\n\nJames Malone told WGAL-TV : \"The everyday voters are not liking what they're seeing in the federal level. They don't like the chaos. We want to be sure that we, as Pennsylvania, are standing up for our neighbors and are standing up for our state. Brotherly love is Pennsylvania. And that just proved out through today - kindness over criticism. That's what we're trying to do. I think that really is what we're looking at moving forward.\"\n\nJosh Parsons wrote on X late Tuesday: \"Obviously we are disappointed in the numbers. We are still reviewing them, but it appears we will come up a little short. We will have a further statement tomorrow. We appreciate all those who worked hard, supported our campaign, and came out to vote today.\"\n\nDemocratic National Committee chair Ken Martin said in a statement: \"In a district that went to Trump by 15 in 2024 and has a 23-point Republican voter registration advantage, Malone's victory is a loud and clear rebuke to Republicans ' threats to the programs Pennsylvania families rely on - from Social Security and Medicaid to our public schools.\n\n\"To protect working Americans, Democrats like Senator-elect Malone are competing everywhere, and in special elections throughout the country, we continue to overperform as voters join us in fighting back against the Trump-Musk agenda. This is a shockwave to the system and the way Republicans have run our government. Republicans everywhere should be afraid.\"\n\nPennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro , a Democrat, wrote on X: \"Tonight in Lancaster County, Pennsylvanians rejected a candidate who embraced the extremism and division coming out of DC. In a district carried comfortably by Donald Trump just a few months ago, they chose a better way forward - an embrace of competence, commonsense, and a desire to bring people together.\n\n\"Congratulations, James Malone. Looking forward to working with you in Harrisburg to continue delivering results and getting stuff done for all Pennsylvanians.\"\n\nRepresentative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat from New York, wrote on X: \"A Pennsylvania State Senate district that Trump had won by 15 points just flipped blue tonight. This is how it's done. Run everywhere. Run down ballot. Focus on local elections ASAP - from school board to councils to state legislatures. We build from there.

But the GOP is growing increasingly nervous about its chances of holding on because of growing frustration with the Trump administration over issues including the firing of federal workers.\n\nThe Democrats , on the other hand, are hoping to seize on public sentiment in special elections across the country. If they can flip the seat, it would chip away at the razor-thin GOP majority in Congress and make it more difficult for Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson to pass key legislation for Trump's agenda.\n\nA new survey from St. Pete Poll points to a competitive race. It polled 403 likely voters in the district from March 22 to March 25 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.\n\nFine held a narrow lead, receiving support from 48.3 percent of the vote compared to 44.2 percent of respondents who said they plan to vote for Weil.\n\nOf those who have already voted, 51 percent went for Weil and 43.1 percent chose Fine, but 53.2 percent of those yet to vote said they plan on selecting Fine, and 38.4 percent said they will vote for Weil, according to the poll.\n\nSpecial elections often see low voter turnout and can yield some surprising results. Las week, Democrats were able to flip a normally solid conservative state senate seat in a Pennsylvania ballot.\n\nThe race for the 6th is one of two Florida Congressional special elections set for next Tuesday. The other is in Florida's 1st Congressional District, to replace former House Representative and unsuccessful U.S. attorney general pick Matt Gaetz .\n\nThe 6th district comprises all of Flagler and Putnam counties, as well as parts of Lake, Marion, St. Johns and Volusia counties. There were 273,387 registered Republicans and 142,347 registered Democrats in the district as of March 7, 2025, according to the data from the Florida Division of Elections.\n\nA Democrat path to victory in the district would require them to either outpace Republicans in turnout or win over a substantial number of registered Republicans willing to break from the party line.\n\nWhile Fine has a slight polling lead, he has been outraised by Weil, who has collected about $10 million between January 9 and March 12. Fine has managed barely a tenth of that, raising about $987,000 from November 26 to March 12, according to data from the Federal Elections Commission (FEC).\n\nWeil, in a statement to Newsweek on Wednesday: \"This race is neck and neck and the poll confirms what we are seeing on the ground. Voters are angry that prices are still high and that their money, their Social Security and Medicare benefits are being taken from them.\"\n\nBryan Piligra, a Fine campaign spokesperson, previously told Newsweek : \"The only thing that matters is making sure Republicans are united to defeat radical Democrats like Josh Weil who will stop at nothing to destroy President Trump. When Randy is victorious on April 1st it will be because of the strength of the Trump agenda and the faith the American people have in him. Randy is grateful for the President's unwavering confidence in him. The voters of CD 6 know they can count on Randy to fight fiercely alongside President Trump to Make America Great Again.\"\n\nThe special election is set to be held on April 1, 2025.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nAndrew Stanton is a Newsweek weekend reporter based in Maine.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nAccording to a new poll, 27 percent of registered American voters have a positive view of the Democratic Party , the lowest level recorded since NBC News began asking the question in 1990.\n\nNewsweek contacted the Democratic Party for comment on Thursday via online contact form outside regular office hours.\n\nIn November, Donald Trump secured a convincing presidential election victory over then-Vice President Kamala Harris , receiving 312 electoral votes to his Democratic rival's 226 and also winning the popular vote for the first time. The Republican Party also flipped the Senate and held on to a narrow House majority.\n\nThe scale of Trump's triumph has sparked widespread soul-searching within the Democratic Party over what went wrong and how to rebuild. Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer has come under sustained criticism from within his party after voting last week to advance a Republican funding bill in a bid to avoid a government shutdown. The fallout over the vote highlights divisions among Democrats over how to proceed under the Trump administration.\n\nNBC News polled 1,000 registered American voters between March 7 and 11. While 55 percent of respondents said they had a negative view of the Democratic Party, 27 percent said they had a positive perception. The poll had a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points.\n\nThe negative and positive figures for the Democrats were respectively the highest and lowest recorded since the network began its polling series more than three decades ago.\n\nThe survey also found that 38 percent of voters had a \"very\" negative view of the Democrats, contrasting 7 percent who had a \"very\" positive perception. Among independent voters, 11 percent had a positive view of the Democrats, while 56 percent saw them negatively.\n\nThere was also evidence of dissatisfaction with the party from its base, with 20 percent of Democratic voters viewing it negatively, twice as high as the figure for Republicans who had a negative view of their party.\n\nThe Democrats' approval figure is still above the lowest recorded by Republicans in an NBC News survey. In 2013, during a government shutdown, the poll found that 22 percent of respondents had a positive view of the Republican Party.\n\nThe survey, which was conducted before the Republican funding bill passed the Senate, showed that Democratic voters wanted their party to take a tougher position in Congress .\n\nAmong Democratic voters, 65 percent said they wanted their congressional representatives to \"stick to their positions even if that means not being able to get things done in Washington,\" while 32 percent said they should \"make compromises with Trump to gain consensus on legislation.\"\n\nThe findings represented a significant shift from Trump's first term. In April 2017, 59 percent of Democratic voters backed the compromise option.\n\nOn March 14, Schumer and nine other Democratic senators backed the Republicans' spending bill in a procedural vote, reaching the 60-vote threshold that made it filibuster-proof. All but two of these lawmakers then voted against its final passage, at which point the Republican senators passed it-with only a simple majority being required.\n\nAhead of Schumer's vote, thousands of people signed a Change.org petition created by a Democratic activist urging him to block the funding bill. His support of the bill has sparked not only backlash from within his party but also calls for him to face a primary challenge .\n\nDemocratic pollster Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates, which conducted the survey in collaboration with Republican pollster Public Opinion Strategies, told NBC News : \"With these numbers, the Democratic Party is not in need of a rebrand. It needs to be rebooted.\"\n\nMSNBC contributor Rotimi Adeoye wrote on X, formerly Twitter : \"I don't want a 'left v moderate' ideological primary for Schumer. I want Pat Ryan, AOC, Daniel Goldman, and anyone else with fresh energy to primary Schumer. We need a new generation of leaders, not someone who has imaginary friends and uses them to understand swing voters.\"\n\nPam Keith, a f ormer Democratic congressional candidate, wrote on X : \"Let it be known this Friday March 14, 2025 that if @AOC primaries @SenSchumer, she will have my unqualified and total support, starting with a significant donation. And let it also be known that I will NEVER donate another dime to any Senator who votes yes for cloture.\"\n\nThe Democrats face intense pressure to reorganize their party and policy platform ahead of next year's midterm elections, where they'll have the opportunity to seize control of either or both chambers of Congress.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nJames Bickerton is a Newsweek U.S. News reporter based in London, U.K. His focus is on covering news and politics in Texas, as well as other general news across the United States.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nRepresentative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , a New York Democrat, has increasingly been discussed as a leading star within the Democratic Party , with some suggesting she could be a 2028 contender for the party's presidential nomination.\n\nWhile potential announcements for 2028 candidates are likely still a couple years off, a number of recent polls are already showing how voters are thinking about the upcoming primary-with Ocasio-Cortez emerging as one of the top few contenders .\n\nNewsweek reached out to Ocasio-Cortez's office for comment on Sunday morning.\n\nDemocrats have largely struggled to respond to President Donald Trump and Republicans since their defeat in the 2024 election. Analysts and activists have consistently highlighted that the party appears leaderless, without a clear direction.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, however, has emerged as one of the Democrats many see to be pushing back in a way that resonates with the party's base.\n\nThe congresswoman has also been holding massive rallies in several states alongside progressive Senator Bernie Sanders , a Vermont independent. With thousands turning out for these events, it suggests the progressive duo has a message that resonates with a significant constituency of voters.\n\nA CNN poll carried out from March 6 to 9 showed that Ocasio-Cortez was the top politician among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents when asked which \"one person best reflects the core values\" of the party.\n\nThe New York progressive was named by 10 percent of respondents. That was narrowly ahead of former Vice President Kamala Harris , who was named by 9 percent. Sanders came in third, with 8 percent. The survey included 1,206 U.S. adults with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.3 percent.\n\nWhile Ocasio-Cortez may be seen as best at representing the party's values, a poll carried out by Morning Consult from March 14 to 16 showed her in third place when respondents were asked about who they would support in 2028.\n\nIn that survey, Harris led the pack by a wide double-digit margin, with 36 percent support. In second was former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg , who sought the party's nomination in 2020, at 10 percent. Ocasio-Cortez had half of Buttigieg's support, with 5 percent.\n\nShe was tied for third with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz , who was Harris' 2024 running mate, and California Governor Gavin Newsom . Billionaire Mark Cuban came in just behind at 4 percent. The poll included 2,210 registered voters and had a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.\n\nAnother recent Echelon Insights poll conducted from March 10 to 13, with 457 likely voters, showed similar results. Harris was at 33 percent and Ocasio-Cortez was at 7 percent, tied with Newsom. Buttigieg was in second place at 10 percent. That poll surveyed 1,007 registered voters and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.\n\nA poll by McLaughlin & Associates, carried out in late January among 414 likely voters, had Harris at 33 percent. Ocasio-Cortez was at 6 percent, behind Buttigieg at 9 percent and Newsom at 7 percent.\n\nRepresentative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at a Las Vegas rally on Thursday: \"This isn't just about Republicans. We need a Democratic Party that fights harder for us, too. But what that means is that we as a community must choose and vote for Democrats and elected officials who know how to stand up for the working class.\"\n\nMary Ann Bennett, who attended Ocasio-Cortez's Denver rally with Sanders on Friday, told Newsweek : \"The Democratic Party has not been taking strong actions for the working class. Bernie and AOC acknowledged this, which is step one, and then laid out their plans for action which were met with strong cheers from the 30,000 people who showed up. Those moments were when I felt the most empowered and ready to fight for my neighbors.\"\n\nMonica Crowley, a former official in the Treasury Department during the first Trump administration, told Fox News in November : \"Just a word of warning to the Republicans, to my party: Do not underestimate AOC. She's young, she's vibrant, she's attractive.\"\n\nDemocrats interested in running in 2028 aren't expected to officially announce until 2027, although it's possible someone could announce sooner.\n\nButtigieg, Newsom and several prominent Democratic governors are rumored to be considering runs. While Harris is also widely speculated to be weighing a second presidential bid, she is also reportedly looking at a run to be California's next governor in the state's 2026 election.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nJason Lemon is a Senior Politics Editor at Newsweek based in Brooklyn, New York.

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nSince the 2024 election, the Democratic Party has been struggling to reconcile its significant losses, not just of the presidency and Senate majority, but of large swaths of formerly reliable Democratic voters. Debates over what to do next have reached a fever pitch, and, with President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans moving swiftly to reshape all things Washington, the stakes could not be higher for the party and the country.\n\nDo Democrats need a more moderate policy direction, as many former Bill Clinton advisers implore? Is the problem not progressive-leaning policies but poor messaging, as chairman of the Democratic National Committee , Ken Martin, believes? Will a younger set of political leaders do the trick? Should the party just \"play dead\" and wait for the inevitable Republican overreach, as longtime Democratic strategist James Carville suggests?\n\nThese are all reasonable questions for a party now at historically low approvals. But what if they are the wrong ones? What if the 2024 election was less about policy and messaging and leadership, and more a bellwether of fundamental shifts in America's political landscape? This is not to deny the importance of policy positions, whether on immigration, the economy, or cultural issues, which Democrats would be wise to reexamine. But what if longtime party assumptions regarding electoral politics were themselves exposed as deeply flawed? Surely that would demand the most urgent attention.\n\nIt appears that is precisely what happened in 2024. Three core narratives guiding Democrats (and many in the media) for decades were shown to be self-serving myths, and no amount of consultant-driven triage will help until the party comes to grips with this new reality.\n\n1. \"Democrats own the presidential popular vote.\" This myth is so entrenched in Democratic Party circles that \"eliminating the Electoral College\" is among their most recognizable promises. But the assumption that Democrats are more popular just because their candidate won the national vote in seven of the prior eight presidential elections never held water-the popular vote is a sideshow to centuries-old rules of the game that reward winning individual states (and their electors) not maximizing votes.\n\nTrump 2024 exploded this myth by holding just five campaign rallies in three deep blue states typically ignored by Republican presidential nominees-New Jersey (one), California (one), and New York (three). It is no coincidence that these states witnessed the largest shift toward Trump in the country in 2024 compared to 2020 (around 10 points each), helping him win the national vote by nearly 2.5 million. This is a bright red warning to Democrats that not only can Republicans easily win the popular vote, but some of their safest states may soon be in play.\n\n2. \"Republicans only win Congress through extreme gerrymandering.\" The notion that only GOP-controlled states draw highly partisan congressional maps never held up to scrutiny-witness a Massachusetts electorate that consistently votes over one-third Republican but has zero GOP seats in the House of Representatives (out of nine). Yet longtime Democratic accusations that Republicans are a minority party that must bend rules to win Congress were debunked in 2024.\n\nIn fact, if not for extreme gerrymandering by Democrats in New York, California, Illinois, and elsewhere, Republicans would have picked up roughly two-dozen more seats in 2024, rather than losing a net one. The GOP's 4 million popular-vote advantage in House races was among its largest since 1928, and jettisoned talk of the Republican Party undermining majoritarian democracy. With multiple blue states projected to shed congressional districts due to population losses, this promises to be a major long-term challenge for Democrats.\n\n3. \"Democrats own America's diverse future.\" Ninety percent of America's over 3,100 counties shifted toward Republicans between 2020 and 2024, with voters of virtually every demographic category contributing to this swing, including younger voters, the non-college educated, et cetera. But Democrats suffered their most devastating losses with racial and ethnic minority groups, directly contradicting the party's longstanding belief that its appeal to an emerging coalition of \"non-white\" voters would help secure an enduring majority. Significant moves toward the GOP included Muslim and Arab Americans (15 points), Native American counties (11), Asians (11), and Black people aged 18-54 (29).\n\nBut the gravest threat to the Democratic Party's future lies in its continuing losses among Hispanic voters, by far the country's fastest-growing demographic group. In 2024, Hispanics shifted toward the GOP by nearly 30 points, including 35 points among Hispanic men and 45 points among all Hispanics aged 18-54. It turns out that even in the age of Trump, Americans of all stripes will vote not based on their racial or ethnic identity, but on which party they believe is better attuned to their overall needs and concerns.\n\nDemocrats are understandably tempted to solve their current predicament in traditional fashion-confront Trump with a new \"resistance,\" tweak their policies and messaging, hope the 2026 midterms go their way. But these are no longer traditional times. Fundamental shifts are occurring in the body politic that have left Democrats on the wrong side of the popular vote, congressional races, and the country's shifting demographics. It's time for a total re-do.\n\nStuart Gottlieb teaches international affairs and public policy at Columbia University.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nDemocrats in a Trump-backing Florida district are raising their hopes of a long shot win in a special election to replace disgraced former rep. Matt Gaetz , buoyed by sentiment about federal spending cuts and disgruntled veterans.\n\nThe April 1 election in Florida's 1st Congressional District puts Democratic challenger Gay Valimont against Republican Jimmy Patronis, the state's chief financial officer and Trump endorsee. The Republicans under Trump carried the district by twice the Democratic vote in 2020.\n\nThe seat became vacant following Gaetz's resignation on November 13. He had been nominated by Trump for attorney general-until he was derailed by an investigation into alleged sexual misconduct, which he denied.\n\nAt the heart of Valimont's underdog bid is a growing backlash and sense of confusion over the cuts recommended by the Department of Government Efficiency Service (DOGE) , the advisory body led by billionaire Elon Musk .\n\nDOGE is spearheading a sweeping downsizing of federal agencies, including the Department of Veterans Affairs. As the VA braces for over 80,000 job cuts, critics warn the blowback could reach even the most conservative corners of the country.\n\nThe seat may offer a case study in how DOGE's activity is cutting through to Trump's voter base, and how much of a threat it is-if at all-to the Republican Party 's narrow control of Congress at the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nFlorida's 1st District is home to more veterans than any other in the United States, with more than 89,000 living in the Panhandle region, and the area is known for its strong support of the military.\n\nThe local economy depends heavily on defense spending, and veterans there are closely tied to federal benefits, hiring programs, and health care services.\n\nPatronis, a former state lawmaker who has served as CFO since 2017, has campaigned as a staunch Trump ally, echoing the president's push to reduce what they call bloated federal bureaucracy.\n\nBut even some local Republicans are questioning the wisdom of cuts that target essential services in their district. \"He needs to stand up and say: 'You want to make cuts? That's fine. But don't do it here,'\" said Jason Boatwright, a former Gaetz staffer.\n\nDespite assurances from VA Secretary Doug Collins that \"mission-critical positions\" would be exempt from cuts, the proposed layoffs have stoked fears that front-line services could be compromised.\n\n\"We have a demonstrated need in this area. And yet they're going to cut VA services,\" Milton Mayor Heather Lindsay, a Republican, told reporters.\n\nA VA clinic in Pensacola, described by locals as overburdened and under-resourced, is one of many facilities bracing for staffing reductions.\n\n\"We need an emergency room,\" said Tim Chandler, a Marine Corps veteran who volunteers at the Pensacola clinic. \"We need a bigger building. We need incentives for more doctors.\"\n\nValimont, who previously led the Florida chapter of Moms Demand Action, is framing the election as a referendum on the dismantling of federal agencies.\n\n\"Imagine if Matt Gaetz's seat saves the Department of Education,\" she told voters at a town hall, referring to Trump's executive order to close down the DOE. \"We have a shot to make this right.\"\n\nHer campaign has raised more than $6 million from January 9 to March 12, and drawn volunteers from across the country. That compares to $1.1 million for Patronis.\n\nJosh Weil, a Democrat running in Florida's 6th Congressional District, who is also outraising his Republican opponent, despite campaigning in a heavily red area, said he is hearing about Musk and the VA cuts on the doorstep.\n\n\"It doesn't matter what type of door we're knocking on, people are unhappy because they didn't vote for that. No one voted for him,\" Weil said of Musk, according to the Florida Phoenix .\n\n\"But even among people who voted for Donald Trump , they never thought that he would, that there would be cuts to the VA.\"\n\nStill, Vailmont's chances are slim on past performance for Democrats .\n\nFlorida's 1st Congressional District has been one of the most Republican-leaning districts in the country and the GOP has held the district since 1995. The area, which encompasses Escambia, Okaloosa, Santa Rosa and parts of Walton counties, is considered so reliably red that Democratic candidates rarely invest heavily in general elections.\n\nThe 2025 special election marks the first significant national attention on the district in decades, but political analysts still consider a Democratic win a serious long shot.\n\nPatronis dismissed legal concerns about DOGE's efforts to override Congress-approved programs, saying : \"Everything that President Trump has rolled out so far, we've been lockstep on,\" he said in an interview. \"If Congress right now had a problem with what the president's doing, you would see Congress act.\"\n\nTrump gave his public backing of Patronis in a post on Truth Social, saying : \" [He] has my Complete and Total Endorsement for Congress. As your next Congressman, Jimmy will work tirelessly alongside of me to Grow our Economy, Secure our Border, Stop Migrant Crime, Strengthen our Brave Military/Vets, Restore American Energy DOMINANCE, and Defend our always under siege Second Amendment.\"\n\nBut even loyal Republicans like Mayor Lindsay question Patronis's stance. She said: \"There are a lot of people who think it's probably not even worth their time. Because that leader's not going to listen to them, because they're only listening to President Trump and Elon Musk.\"\n\nDoug Stauffer, chair of the Okaloosa County GOP, said a loss in the 1st District is unthinkable : \"If we don't win decisively, then we have failed.\"\n\nValimont is attempting to turn traditional GOP strengths-support for veterans, defense and rule-of-law-against Patronis by highlighting the local impacts of federal overreach.\n\nHer campaign has also tied Patronis to Florida's property insurance crisis, citing his regulatory role as CFO in a state with the highest rates in the country.\n\nThe April 1 special election is shaping up as a litmus test for the durability of Trump-era conservatism in a district where federal cuts hit close to home.\n\nThis article uses reporting by The Associated Press.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nShane Croucher is a Breaking News Editor based in London, UK.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers are calling for President Donald Trump 's nominee for the Social Security Administration (SSA) to undergo an investigation.\n\nTrump has nominated Frank Bisignano as the next leader of the SSA, but some Democrats say Bisignano has lied about his involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\nBisignano, CEO of fintech and payments firm Fiserv, is a Republican donor who has supported Trump as well as former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and Senator Marco Rubio . He previously worked for JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup.\n\nAllegations that Bisignano is working with DOGE have sparked concerns that he would enforce major cuts to Social Security, either through direct benefit reductions or administrative changes.\n\nDemocratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon voiced their concerns over Trump's new Social Security pick during a news conference Wednesday.\n\n\"This administration is intent on slashing Social Security,\" Schumer said Wednesday, adding that Trump's goal is to \"destroy Social Security from within.\"\n\nWith Bisignano at the helm of the SSA, Schumer said, Trump would be able to privatize the program, closing a substantial number of Social Security offices in the process.\n\n\"What they're doing is in effect a benefit cut,\" Schumer said.\n\nLast month, the SSA announced it would be cutting 7,000 jobs, which has some concerned over how seniors and others who rely on monthly Social Security benefits will be able to navigate any issues with their payments.\n\nWyden told reporters Wednesday that Bisignano lied about his involvement with DOGE, the department Trump created in the early days of his presidency to slash government spending.\n\n\"He handpicked DOGE agents and pressured Social Security employees to cut corners,\" Wyden said, adding that there should be a bipartisan investigation into these allegations.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing, Bisignano was questioned over his ties to DOGE, the department spearheaded by billionaire Elon Musk .\n\nWhile Bisignano previously called himself \"fundamentally a DOGE person,\" he distanced himself from the department during Tuesday's hearing.\n\nBisignano said he had \"no contact\" with the DOGE team. But Wyden said a senior agency official alerted him that Bisignano had \"frequent\" communication with Michael Russo, the SSA's chief information officer.\n\nNewsweek reached out to the SSA for comment via email.\n\nTrump wrote in a post to Truth Social in December: \"I am very pleased to nominate Frank Bisignano to serve as the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration. Frank is a business leader, with a tremendous track record of transforming large corporations. He will be responsible to deliver on the Agency's commitment to the American People for generations to come!\"\n\nKevin Thompson, finance expert and founder/CEO of 9i Capital told Newsweek : \"I actually think Frank Bisignano has a solid chance of being appointed. A lot of Trump's picks in the past made it through, even when people initially thought they had no shot.\"\n\n\"Now, let's be clear, any significant changes to Social Security would have to go through Congress . That includes things like benefit cuts or changes to how the system works. So, while executive orders can tweak certain aspects of the Social Security Administration, like staffing or service delivery, real legislative changes need a vote.\"\n\nAlex Beene, financial literacy instructor for the University of Tennessee at Martin, told Newsweek : \"President Trump's nominee to head the Social Security Administration Frank Bisignano seems like a perfect candidate for what this administration has been pushing in terms of efficiency. He's worked with a number of prior businesses in helping operations to run more efficiently and be cost-effective in their approach to new and existing endeavors.\"\n\nHe added: \"However, some past comments made by Bisignano have led to the belief he may want to privatize parts of the administration, beliefs he has dismissed. While we're certainly anticipating cuts to the administration, those cuts should primarily be in the form of workforce and services. Any cuts to benefits would be a true surprise, as both sides of the aisle look at cutting Social Security benefits as equivalent to political suicide in terms of reelection chances.\"\n\nMartha Shedden, president and cofounder of the National Association of Registered Social Security Analysts, told Newsweek : \"He is, and has been, a very successful and wealthy CEO of a number of payment companies. Leading the profitable success of these businesses though is not the same as being in charge of the SSA. Over 50 percent of beneficiaries rely on their monthly checks for the majority of their retirement income. I have not seen any past experience or interest by Bisignano in any type of social insurance programs.\"\n\nIf Bisignano is approved to lead the SSA, he could align himself with Musk, who has called the Social Security system a \"Ponzi scheme.\"\n\n\"That kind of rhetoric makes people nervous, especially when the person in question could soon oversee the SSA,\" Thompson said.\n\nThe agency also recently said it would stop allowing Americans to confirm their identity via phone number. Instead, applicants and beneficiaries will need to provide their proof of identity in person at their local Social Security office. These changes are set to go into effect within the next two weeks.\n\n\"The changes could be devastating. If you're forcing elderly applicants to either go online or visit an office, which might be closed or hours away, that's a huge problem,\" Thompson said.\n\n\"We're talking about people who may have physical disabilities, vision issues, or who simply aren't tech-savvy. Expecting them to navigate a website or wait in long lines without help just isn't realistic. This disproportionately impacts the most vulnerable-those with limited mobility, hearing loss, and poor eyesight. It's a real concern.\"\n\nThe SSA also faces a funding crisis that would see future monthly payments slashed by roughly 20 percent by the mid-2030s unless Congress intervenes.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nSuzanne Blake is a Newsweek reporter based in New York.

Special Elections Explained\n\nEwan Palmer is a Newsweek News Reporter based in London, U.K. His focus is reporting on US politics, and Florida news.

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nThe Republican Party is no longer at risk of losing control of House if the results of upcoming special elections all go against them, but Democrats could still pile on pressure on the GOP ahead of the 2026 midterms.\n\nThe perilous position of the GOP's majority in the House of Representatives was highlighted Thursday when President Donald Trump announced he would be pulling New York Representative Elise Stefanik 's nomination to be the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations .\n\nTrump said on Truth Social that he is no longer asking Stefanik to join his Cabinet, as it is \"essential that we maintain EVERY Republican seat in Congress.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson said Thursday that \"it is well known Republicans have a razor-thin House majority\" and Stefanik staying in Congress will allow the GOP to \"keep one of the toughest, most resolute members of our Conference in place to help drive forward President Trump's America First policies.\"\n\nThe Republican Party currently holds a 218-213 seat majority in the House with four seats currently vacated. This means, when everyone present, the GOP can only afford having two lawmakers vote against a bill for it to pass, presuming all Democrats vote against.\n\nHad Stefanik vacated her seat to become U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, it would have triggered a special election in New York. This would have been the fifth congressional special election to take place in the U.S. this year, with three confirmed in Florida and Arizona, and one to be announced in Texas.\n\nThis would have given the Democrats a long-shot hope of flipping the House with victories in all five races. However, the odds were always stacked against them, with the New York and Florida districts in strong Republican-friendly areas.\n\nThe best the Democratic Party can hope for is winning the four remaining special elections. This would leave the GOP in control of the lower chamber with a 218-217 majority, meaning they would not be able to afford any Republican defection on bills going forward.\n\nIt is more likely the GOP candidates will win the two special elections in Florida, with Democrats retaining the seats in Arizona and Texas. This would give the GOP a 220-215 majority in the House, giving their majority more breathing room.\n\n\"It will be harder for Dems to flip the House in 2026 than it has been for minority parties to win majorities in previous midterms because gerrymandering has become so pervasive that very few marginal districts exist,\" Charles Bullock, a political science professor at the University of Georgia, told Newsweek . \"However, if Republicans struggle in the special elections, it is a signal-but not a guarantee-that the GOP may lose the House.\"\n\n\"Moreover, if the GOP performs poorly in special elections, it might prompt President Donald Trump to back off from some of his more controversial policies. On the other hand, if each party wins seats it has previously held and there is no significant change in party voting, that will be interpreted as showing no widespread dissatisfaction with the current administration and its policies.\"\n\nThe congressional district was previously held by Matt Gaetz , who left when he was originally tapped to be Trump's pick for attorney general.\n\nWednesday's election will be between the Republican candidate, Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis, and Democratic hopeful Gay Valimont. Patronis is expected to win back the seat for the GOP, despite his campaign being heavily outspent by Valimont's. Gaetz won reelection in November 2024 with 66 percent of the vote.\n\nOn the same day, a special election will take place in Florida, which has caused more concern for the GOP despite also being in a strong Republican-friendly area.\n\nThe 6th District was previously held by Michael Waltz, who resigned to become Trump's national security adviser. Waltz won reelection in November 2024 by 33 points. Trump-endorsed Republican Florida State Senator Randy Fine going against Democrat Josh Weil for the seat.\n\nRepublican figures, including Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and North Carolina Representative Richard Hudson, chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee, have expressed concern about Fine's campaign.\n\nA Florida Politics poll released Wednesday of 403 likely voters showed Fine with a 4-point lead over Weil (48 percent to 44 percent)-within the margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 points.\n\nBryan Piligra, a spokesperson for Fine's campaign, previously told Newsweek that the Republican will be \"victorious\" at the special election. \"When Randy is victorious on April 1, it will be because of the strength of the Trump agenda and the faith the American people have in him,\" Piligra said. \"Randy is grateful for the President's unwavering confidence in him.\"\n\nFlorida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried said they are \"fully mobilized\" to flip the two districts in next week's special elections.\n\n\"Randy Fine thought he could cruise to victory as Trump's hand-picked candidate and walk into office without a fight. Not on our watch,\" Fried told Newsweek . \"We will continue to support both campaigns to chase down every last vote.\"\n\nLongtime Democratic Representative Raúl Grijalva died on March 13 at age 77, almost a year after announcing he had been diagnosed with cancer. Grijalva's death has triggered a special election in one of the most Democratic districts in Arizona for September 23.\n\nGrijalva's daughter, Adelita, who currently serves on the Pima County Board of Supervisors, is expected to announce her candidacy in the July Democratic primary. Former state Representative Daniel Hernandez has already confirmed his candidacy.\n\nTwo Republicans-Jimmy Rodriguez and Raul Verdugo-have announced they are running in the special GOP primary for Arizona's 7th District on July 15.\n\nDemocratic Representative Sylvester Turner died on March 5 at age 70. Texas Governor Greg Abbott is to set the date for the special election to fill the vacant seat, which is expected to take place before the end of the year. But according to The Texas Tribune , he has shown no rush to do so, and state law specifies no deadline.\n\nThere are to be no party primaries. Instead, all candidates are to run in the special election. If no candidate receives at least 50 percent of the vote, the top two advance to a runoff. Christian Menefee, the outgoing Harris County attorney, and former Houston City Council member Amanda Edwards are among the Democrats who have announced their intentions to run in the special election.\n\nTurner, a former Houston mayor, was elected with 69 per c en t of the vote in November 2024.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nEwan Palmer is a Newsweek News Reporter based in London, U.K. His focus is reporting on US politics, and Florida news.

      "text": "Confidence in federal civil servants remains far lower among Republicans than Democrats\n\nNumbers, Facts and Trends Shaping Your World\n\nRead our research on:\n\nFull Topic List\n\nRead Our Research On:\n\n|\n\nRepublicans and Democrats have long held very different views of federal \"career employees\" - the civil servants who work for government agencies or departments and do not change with administrations. That continues to be the case today: Most Democrats have high levels of confidence in the federal workforce, while most Republicans do not.\n\nThe Trump administration has made reducing the size of this workforce - through its Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) team in particular - one of its top priorities .\n\nPew Research Center conducted this survey to assess Americans' views of career civil servants, presidential appointees, and federal and state relations. We surveyed 5,086 U.S. adults from Jan. 27 to Feb. 2, 2025.\n\nEveryone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center's American Trends Panel (ATP), a group of people recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses who have agreed to take surveys regularly. This kind of recruitment gives nearly all U.S. adults a chance of selection. Surveys were conducted either online or by telephone with a live interviewer. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other factors. Read more about the ATP's methodology .\n\nHere are the questions used for this analysis , along with responses , and its methodology .\n\nOverall, a slim majority of Americans (55%) express a great deal or fair amount of confidence in federal career employees, while 44% have little or no confidence, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted Jan. 27-Feb. 2. But the already wide partisan divide in these views has continued to grow:\n\nConservative Republicans, in particular, have little confidence in the federal civil service: 30% now have at least a fair amount of confidence, while 70% have little to no confidence. By contrast, moderate and liberal Republicans are more divided: 51% have at least a fair amount of confidence in civil servants, while 48% don't have much confidence in them.\n\nLarge majorities of both liberal Democrats (77%) and conservative and moderate Democrats (69%) have at least a fair amount of confidence in civil servants.\n\nRelated: What the data says about federal workers\n\nIn addition to career employees, presidents appoint officials to oversee government agencies. Partisan confidence in these officials generally tracks with the party holding the White House.\n\nToday, 71% of Republicans say they have at least a fair amount of confidence in presidential appointees. In 2018, during the first Trump administration, 60% of Republicans expressed confidence in presidential appointees. But in 2022 - when Democrat Joe Biden was president - just 21% of Republicans said they had confidence in presidential appointees.\n\nAmong Democrats, 22% currently say they have a great deal or a fair amount of confidence in presidential appointees. This is slightly lower than the 28% who expressed confidence in 2018 during the first Trump administration. In 2022, when Biden was president, 54% of Democrats said they had confidence in presidential appointees.\n\nAmericans' views about the relationship between the state and federal governments have also shifted somewhat with the change in administration.\n\nConcerns about states' willingness to work with the federal government\n\nToday, 40% of Republicans and 34% of Democrats say they are extremely or very concerned about states not being willing enough to work with the federal government. These views have shifted since the Biden administration, with Republicans and Democrats moving in opposite directions. In 2023, 27% of Republicans and 54% of Democrats expressed these concerns.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats have also moved in opposite directions when it comes to concern about the federal government setting policies on issues that may be better left to state governments. Today, Democrats are more likely than Republicans to say they are extremely or very concerned about this (46% vs. 30%).\n\nIn 2023, we asked a similar question: \"How concerned are you that the federal government is doing too much on issues better left to state governments?\" At that time, Republicans were far more likely than Democrats to express concern (62% vs. 22%).\n\nConcerns that rights and protections may differ across states\n\nDemocrats continue to be more concerned than Republicans that the rights and protections a person has might differ by state. Today, 66% of Democrats say they are extremely or very concerned about this, compared with 27% of Republicans.\n\nDemocrats' level of concern is relatively unchanged from 2023. In contrast, Republicans' level of concern has decreased by 12 points.\n\nNote: Here are the questions used for this analysis , along with responses , and its methodology .\n\nTopics\n\nTed Van Green is a research analyst focusing on U.S. politics and policy at Pew Research Center .\n\n901 E St. NW, Suite 300 Washington, DC 20004 USA (+1) 202-419-4300 | Main (+1) 202-857-8562 | Fax (+1) 202-419-4372 | Media Inquiries\n\nABOUT PEW RESEARCH CENTER Pew Research Center is a nonpartisan, nonadvocacy fact tank that informs the public about the issues, attitudes and trends shaping the world.

      "text": "Are Democrats Regretting Trying To Out-Hawk Trump?\n\nDiplomacy\n\nMatthew Petti | 3.13.2025 10:35 AM\n\nThe Democratic Party has been trying to paint negotiations as appeasement. During the 2024 elections, the Democratic platform condemned then-candidate Donald Trump's \"fecklessness\" on Iran and \"love letters\" to North Korea. When Trump argued that the U.S. should negotiate with countries like Iran and Russia over economic sanctions, Kamala Harris' campaign attacked his \"weak\" and \" reckless foreign policy .\"\n\nBut some Democrats seem to regret taking that line. \"Being afraid to negotiate, to my mind, is the ultimate sign of weakness because it just proves that you think that if I get in a room, you're going to trick me and I'm going to do something stupid,\" Rep. Adam Smith (D-Wash.) said during a panel discussion Wednesday.\n\nSmith, the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, was speaking to the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, an antiwar nonprofit where I worked as a researcher in 2020 and 2021. When asked by Quincy Institute Vice President Trita Parsi whether Democrats were seen as warmongers, Smith admitted that the party \"walked into that problem.\"\n\nThe congressman argued that Democrats must \"much more aggressively embrace diplomacy. I think we should have been much louder during the Biden administration.\" He claimed to have always believed \"that the Biden administration should have directly talked to Russia,\" although not in a way that led to \"shutting off Ukraine and leaving them completely vulnerable the way Trump just did.\"\n\nSmith concurred with Parsi's claim that Democrats could \"reclaim the position as the party that actually promoted diplomacy, opposed stupid wars.\"\n\nNot all Democrats agree with Smith's criticism, of course. During confirmation hearings for Trump appointee Elbridge Colby last week, several Democratic senators doubled down on a hawkish line of attack, complaining about Trump's eagerness to talk to Russia. Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) put it the most bluntly: \"Trump is in the middle of a capitulation, not a negotiation.\"\n\nAt the Quincy Institute event, Smith blamed \"pressure from the right and pressure from the left\" for the Democrats' muddled stance. The Democratic Party is trying to balance between Republicans, who call Democrats weak in the face of adversaries, and leftists, who believe that Democrats are in bed with \"neoconservative global dominance visions\" and \"jump all over us for anything we do,\" he argued.\n\n\"My father used to have this expression that between two stools, you sit on the floor,\" Smith concluded.\n\nSmith isn't the first person to note the problem of the \" defensive crouch \" in Democratic foreign policy. By accepting hawks' \"framing of the issues\" and trying to win on those grounds, Democrats often \"box themselves in to continuing policies that they have previously declared failures,\" journalist Daniel Larison wrote in 2021, several months before the Russian invasion of Ukraine began.\n\nRather than drumming up public support, Democrats' hawkish turn has hurt them politically. Americans disapproved of former President Joe Biden's handling of Russia and Ukraine by 22 percent in 2024, but a slim majority approved of Trump's handling of the issue by February 2025, polls showed .\n\nTrump's more hawkish proposals-taking over Gaza, Greenland, and Canada- poll very badly . A new poll released by CNN on Wednesday shows that a slim majority thinks that Trump is not \"an effective world leader.\" It's not that Trump's foreign policy is particularly popular; it's that Democrats' hawkish approach has been particularly unpopular .\n\nBeyond criticizing the domestic politics of hawkishness, Smith acknowledged that it's \"simply not possible to have that level of dominance\" over the entire world that the U.S. had after World War II or the Cold War. \"We're going to have to look for partnerships, alliances and a little bit more flexibility on the whole democracy, autocracy thing, in order to build that stable world that we envisioned,\" he said.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "The Tech Bros Love Trump Because the Democrats Pushed Them Away\n\nTrump Administration\n\nRobby Soave | 1.20.2025 8:49 AM\n\nFour days before Donald Trump's second presidential inauguration, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman shared on X a threatening letter he had received from Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Michael Bennett (D-Col.). In the letter, the senators expressed dismay that the tech entrepreneur had donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund.\n\n\"We are concerned that your company and other Big Tech donors are using your massive contributions to the inaugural fund to cozy up to the incoming Trump administration in an effort to avoid scrutiny, limit regulation, and buy favor,\" they wrote . \"These donations raise questions about corruption and the influence of corporate money on the Trump administration, and Congress and the public demand answers.\"\n\nIn response, Altman noted that the donation was actually a personal contribution, not one made by his company. He also could not resist pointing out the hypocrisy.\n\n\"Funny, they never sent me one of these [letters] for contributing to democrats...\" he wrote.\n\nAltman may very well be correct about that, although supporting the Democratic Party-financially, rhetorically, or otherwise-has given tech leaders very little actual protection from Democratic lawmakers. Just ask Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who were repeatedly dragged before Congress and accused of conspiring to overturn democracy , abuse children , and commit other sins. By criticizing Trump's views on immigration and otherwise touting liberal causes, Zuckerberg may have thought he had successfully ingratiated himself with the Biden administration; yet in July 2021, President Joe Biden accused Facebook of \"killing people\" because Zuckerberg had not unilaterally put the government in charge of content moderation.\n\nAnd that, in a nutshell, is why so many of the wealthiest and most influential innovators in the tech sector are abandoning the Democratic Party en masse.\n\nSome, such as venture capitalist Marc Andreessen , Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, have been full MAGA for a while; others, such as Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, are now officially seeking political neutrality while dipping their toes in rightist waters. But there's one thing they all have in common: a dawning realization that the political project of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party is to bring technological innovation to a grinding halt.\n\nYes, many Republicans-too many-have also railed against tech in recent years, betraying their previous support for free market principles in order to exact revenge on social media platforms that limited conservative speech. But the plain truth is that the GOP's desire to break up large, profitable, and successful tech companies is largely about score-settling: Political figures such as Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) were against Big Tech because Big Tech was against them.\n\nThis does not make the Republican attacks on tech defensible. Indeed, they directed their fire in the wrong direction, as the main reason that social media deplatformed conservative speech was federal pressure . But the progressive war on Big Tech is very different.\n\nWarren, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), and their allies are not narrowly anti-tech because tech is mean to them. Their ideologies are opposed to the kind of economic power that accrues to successful technological ventures. Moreover, social media companies have learned that no amount of capitulation to government dictates will ever be enough for the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention. There will always be another hit piece in a mainstream media outlet about the failures of Facebook, X, Snapchat, Google, TikTok, or someone else to counter foreign disinformation, right-wing propaganda, hate speech, etc. There will always be another congressional inquiry and a proposal to remove Section 230, the liability shield for internet companies. There will always be the threat of antitrust legislation aimed at the sheer bigness of these companies, even though polls consistently show the American public broadly like and appreciate the services the tech companies render.\n\nFor the past several years, Democrats have attracted some conservative support for their anti-tech agenda; the populist faction of Trump's Republican Party has noisily embraced antitrust and the elimination of Section 230. But Trump no longer seems particularly committed to their agenda: He has empowered Musk, is working with TikTok to thwart Biden's bipartisan ban on the platform, and has even made peace with Zuckerberg. Musk, Bezos, Zuckerberg, and TikTok CEO Show Zi Chew are all attending Trump's inauguration.\n\nThe end result may well be a GOP that is more comfortable with tech markets. That would be good for economic growth and unfettered innovation. Perhaps libertarians should send a cheeky thank-you letter to Elizabeth Warren.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "What, If Anything, Will Democrats Learn From This Election?\n\nDemocratic Party\n\nJoe Lancaster | 11.7.2024 3:10 PM\n\nVotes are still left to be counted, but it is clear by now that former President Donald Trump is once again the president-elect, prevailing over Vice President Kamala Harris in not only the Electoral College but also the popular vote. This marks not only the first time he has ever come close to majority support, but also only the second time since the end of the Cold War that a Republican presidential candidate has won the popular vote.\n\n\"Of the counties with nearly complete results, more than 90 percent shifted in favor of former President Donald J. Trump in the 2024 presidential election,\" The New York Times found on the morning after the election. \"Early results showed that even a number of states where Vice President Kamala Harris was ahead had shifted right.\"\n\n\"Trump picked up more votes in every state apart from Utah and Washington,\" added the Financial Times . \"Across the US, the data suggests women, urban voters and the Latino vote did not come through for Harris, while rural areas came out strong for Trump.\"\n\nWith the U.S. Senate also lost and the House very much in peril, Democrats may find themselves in the wilderness yet again. But what lessons will they take from this experience in electoral repudiation? For that matter, will they learn anything ?\n\nIt's not a foregone conclusion that they will: In the three elections in which Trump has competed, Democrats largely treated him as an existential threat, making a case for his inherent unfitness for office but often forgetting to mount a positive campaign for themselves. And then, after losing to him in 2016-even after beating him in 2020-the party did no apparent soul-searching to determine why voters would pick such an unfit candidate.\n\nIronically, it's a lesson they could learn from Republicans. In 2012, after losing two presidential elections in a row, Republicans conducted a \"full autopsy\" on the moribund party and its electoral failures, hoping to determine how to appeal to voters going forward. To compile the report , which was released the following year, the panel conducted conference calls, online surveys, focus groups, and more than 3,000 \"group listening sessions.\"\n\nDemocrats, on the other hand, did no such self-inquiry when Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in 2016. \"Democrats didn't even attempt to do an autopsy in the wake of 2016, relegating debates about the party's future to places like Twitter and cable news,\" wrote Jon Favreau, a progressive commentator and former speechwriter for President Barack Obama.\n\nThat may not be entirely true. In fact, Democrats tasked then-Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.) with compiling an autopsy of the 2016 election, only to then effectively bury it: Maloney presented the report to lawmakers \"during a members-only gathering at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee headquarters\" in 2017, Politico reported , but \"members were not allowed to have copies of the report and may view it only under the watchful eyes of DCCC staff.\"\n\nClinton herself conceded defeat but apparently never quite accepted it. In the months after the election, she blamed her loss on sexism , Russian hacks , then-FBI Director James Comey's late-October announcement that the bureau had reopened its investigation into her use of a private email server...but never herself or her campaign.\n\nTrue, none of those explanations is without merit. But Russian hackers did not keep Clinton from ever visiting Wisconsin during the general campaign, and Comey's letter did not enable Trump to turn out \"a flood of rural and small-town working class voters\" in Pennsylvania, as William A. Galston of the Brookings Institute wrote .\n\nEven the 2020 election , when Joe Biden beat Trump by more than 7 million votes, provided an opportunity for reflection. \"Democrats...are entitled to a temporary feeling of triumphalism,\" Ross K. Baker wrote in January 2021, \"but there is also cause for them do some reflection on how they should reach out to the tens of millions of voters who rejected them and who are sullen and even rebellious.\"\n\nInstead, Democrats reacted as if Trump was a comic book supervillain they had banished back to his home planet, never to return.\n\n\"Relax, A Trump Comeback In 2024 Is Not Going To Happen,\" read the headline of a December 2020 piece by Politico 's John Harris. \"The Trump years were not just a hallucination,\" Harris wrote. \"But chances are they will soon enough come to feel like they were - which won't leave much opportunity to return to real power.\"\n\n\"Donald Trump will never be allowed to step foot in the Capitol again,\" Lawrence O'Donnell proclaimed on his MSNBC show, days after the incursion on January 6. \"Never. Unless he insists on testifying in his own defense in his Senate second impeachment trial.\"\n\nIndeed, the Capitol riot likely should have marked the end of Trump's political career: Even setting aside his potential culpability, his behavior during the violence sufficiently demonstrated his unfitness for any future returns to the White House.\n\nBut given that both Democrats and Republicans failed to convict in his Senate impeachment trial, the only way to keep him from office was to defeat him at the ballot box. Instead, Democrats apparently took Trump's unfitness as so manifestly self-evident that it was not worth interrogating why 74 million people voted for him in 2020, and whether they would do so again.\n\nTo be clear, an autopsy by itself can't turn a party's prospects around. One of the GOP report's top-line recommendations was that the party should be more amenable to immigrants, specifically from Latin America: \"If Hispanics think we do not want them here, they will close their ears to our policies.\" Some Republicans were open to it: Just two days after the 2012 election, Fox News host Sean Hannity told his radio audience he had \"evolved on\" immigration, advocating \"a pathway\" to citizenship \"for those people that are here.\"\n\nThe punchline, of course, is that in the very next election, the party nominated Trump, who began his campaign by calling Mexicans \"rapists\" and pledging to build a wall on the southern border.\n\nBut ironically, Trump's electoral successes have included increasing his share of Hispanic voters: Trump won nearly 30 percent of the Hispanic vote in 2016 , which rose to 32 percent in 2020 and an estimated 46 percent in 2024.\n\nA Democratic autopsy of the 2024 election would therefore ask why nearly half of all Hispanic voters would choose Trump over Harris-along with increasing numbers of nearly every other demographic group.\n\nEven at this early juncture, possible explanations abound. Inflation, resulting from COVID-19 pandemic policy and exacerbated by Biden-era spending bills, topped many voters' lists of concerns, and voters who listed the economy as their primary concern picked Trump by a 4-to-1 margin. Joe Biden's insistence on staying in the race amid plummeting poll numbers likely also hindered Harris' ability to course-correct from an unpopular incumbent.\n\nBut to reach any sort of conclusion, Democrats will have to ignore their natural instincts to cast blame elsewhere, on disinformation or foreign interference or minor gaffes on the campaign trail. Whether they like it or not, Democrats received a drubbing on Tuesday, and only sincere soul-searching will yield any useful explanations.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

Activate your online access\n\nAt a protest against Elon Musk's takeover of the Treasury Department, activists turned their ire on the Democratic lawmakers in the crowd and demanded a response that fits the moment.\n\nA demonstrator holds a sign during a protest against Elon Musk outside the US Treasury building in Washington, DC, on, February 4, 2025.\n\nToward the end of Tuesday's mass protest outside the US Department of the Treasury, one of the event's organizers, Indivisible chair Ezra Levin, attempted a rhetorical feat of forbidding difficulty: leading an outraged crowd in the parliamentary-geek chant \"Withhold unanimous consent!\" It wasn't exactly \"We shall overcome\" or \"No blood for oil,\" as Levin acknowledged: \"I know this is wonky and technical.\" But the head of Indivisible-the grassroots initiative that mounted successful campaigns to help Democrats regain control of Congress in 2018-stressed that the refrain, which references the upper legislative chamber's practice of expediting votes via formulaic suspensions of debate, is a crucial step in galvanizing more effective opposition to the rolling Project 2025 coup. This coup now has DOGE director and \"special government employee\" Elon Musk harvesting sensitive financial and government payment data with zero oversight or accountability-which was why the protesters had converged on the Treasury building, a federal bureaucratic redoubt down the street from the White House that's the scene of Musk's crime.\n\nThe crowd had been marshaled by a trio of liberal advocacy groups: Move On and the Working Families Party as well as Indivisible. At well over 1,000 strong, it was primed to hear Levin's pitch. Indeed, the protesters' impatient wonky disposition came at times as a rebuke to the clutch of Democratic lawmakers who delivered speeches registering anger and outrage at the Musk-Trump administration's unprecedented assault on the separation of powers, government payments, the privacy of ordinary citizens, and the need to face it all down. As one after another member of Congress outlined the horrors perpetrated by Musk and his team of tech lackeys, protesters would shout back, \"Arrest them when they come out!\" and \"Lock him up!\" As the speeches continued, one especially plaintive chant took hold in the crowd: \"Tell us what to do!\"\n\nLevin obliged that demand, calling not only for the suspension of unanimous consent, but also for a blockade of all pending confirmations of Trump cabinet nominees until the Musk Treasury putsch is scrapped. He noted, however, that for all the lawmaker outrage on display at this event, 22 Senate Democrats had rubber-stamped Trump's nominee to head the Veterans' Administration , Doug Collins. (Nor was that the only Senate failure to competently advise or consent; after the rally had broken up, the chamber approved Trump's massively corrupt choice for attorney general , Pam Bondi-although here there was just one Democratic yea vote, Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman, aka Joe Manchin in a hoodie.)\n\nThis striking disjuncture between an aggrieved public demanding action and a national Democratic Party operating on autopilot was the backstory to the Treasury protest. The resource plan that Indivisible organizers drafted for protesters registers great exasperation with the Democrats' slow-moving, ideas-challenged posture in the present crisis. \"Dems are still playing by the old rules, trying to demonstrate that they're reasonable in the face of an unreasonable MAGA party,\" the document reads. \"In their minds, this is how they win back power-ignore the coup, and hope their mealy-mouthed statements help win majorities in 2026 and 2028. But nobody sees your boring statement, and we're losing power to Trump, Musk, and their cronies every day that Dems don't fight back.\"\n\nIt's not hard to chart the reasons why this exasperation has taken hold in the party's movement base. Indeed, as Musk was dispatching his data team to illegally hack into the Treasury department's files and rewrite the system's coding , Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer took to his X account to rouse public ire with these stirring words: \"You're watching the Super Bowl next week. Wait till Trump's tariffs raise your pizza prices.\" Two days later, he outlined his thinking on how the Democrats should fight the Trump agenda in an interview with Semafor 's Burgess Everett ; the party shouldn't go outrage-chasing, he advised, but should instead wait in the certainty that \"Trump will screw up.\"\n\nSchumer was among the assembled speakers at the rally, alongside other resistance-minded lawmakers such as Massachusetts Senator Elizebath Warren of Massachusetts, Texas Representative Jasmine Crockett, and Maryland Representative Jamie Raskin. (Not long before the protest, a number of these lawmakers attempted to get into the Treasury building only to be denied entry -a reprise of the lockout that greeted another group of congressional Democrats outside the US agency for International Development on Monday as they sought to gain more information about the Musk-orchestrated freeze on its operations.) Schumer's presence was at least a signal that the grassroots strategy of prodding lawmakers to act is already starting to bear fruit. Still, Levin made it clear that a cameo at a demonstration won't be enough to placate movement activists.\n\n\"Leader Schumer, he led...some good chants,\" Levin said. \"But I've got a chant for him: Do something!\" The crowd took up that one with gusto, along with Levin's next directive: \"Shut down the Senate!\"\n\nMost of the Democratic senators in attendance shifted uncomfortably during that call to action; their chamber is, after all, the least democratic branch of representative government, and left to their own devices, they like unanimous consent and bipartisan confirmation votes just fine. (One exception earlier in the evening was a tie-less Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy, an increasingly vocal populist critic of Democratic business as usual, who said \"the US Senate shouldn't approve a single Trump nominee\" until Musk stands down, along with \"the creepy 22-year-olds\" working for him.)\n\nIt's deeply unsettling, with the authoritarian seizure of basic governing operations well under way, to see the battered movement forces in the party having to go to such great lengths to ensure that Democratic leaders maintain their focus and resolve. It's especially distressing in view of the same leadership's consistent and properly urgent message, during the presidential campaign, that Donald Trump's Project 2025 agenda was a plan to install him as a de facto dictator and to trash the bulwarks of American democracy. Now that their dark prophecy has proven true, all too many Democratic leaders are on their heels-when they're not phoning in confirmation votes.\n\nThat's one reason, amid the wonky uproar of the protest, one chant from the crowd lingered with special force: \"What's the plan?\"\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

      "text": "Trump Is Weaponizing the DOJ Just Like He Accused Democrats of Doing\n\nDepartment of Justice\n\nJoe Lancaster | 3.7.2025 2:15 PM\n\nThroughout the 2024 presidential campaign season, Donald Trump accused his Democratic opponents-President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris-of using the levers of power against him.\n\n\"The Biden regime's weaponization of our system of justice is straight out of the Stalinist Russia horror show,\" he told rallygoers in March 2023 after being indicted in Manhattan for violating election law. In a September 2024 debate against Harris, Trump even blamed Democrats' rhetoric for the assassination attempt he survived weeks earlier, saying \"I probably took a bullet to the head because of the things that they say about me.\"\n\nBut now that Trump is firmly ensconced back in office, his administration seems to have no interest in stopping government weaponization. Rather, it seems keen to wield that power for itself. Looking back now on Trump's complaints, it appears less that he was upset than that he was jealous.\n\nOn February 10, acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove issued a memo to Danielle Sassoon, the acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. Citing the authorization of Attorney General Pam Bondi, Bove directed Sassoon to dismiss the charges in the Department of Justice's (DOJ) ongoing case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams for bribery and wire fraud.\n\nTwo weeks before Trump took office, the DOJ adamantly maintained Adams' guilt. \"Law enforcement has continued to identify additional individuals involved in Adams's conduct, and to uncover additional criminal conduct by Adams,\" acting U.S. Attorney Walter Kim wrote in a motion to the court.\n\nBut just weeks later, Bove instructed Sassoon to drop the case-partly because \"the pending prosecution has unduly restricted Mayor Adams' ability to devote full attention and resources\" to enforcing Trump's immigration policies.\n\nSassoon refused, telling Bondi in a letter that dropping the charges against Adams for the reasons Bove specified would be wholly inappropriate and unethical. \"If a criminal prosecution cannot be used to punish political activity, it likewise cannot be used to induce or coerce such activity,\" Sassoon wrote. \"Threatening criminal prosecution even to gain an advantage in civil litigation is considered misconduct for an attorney.\"\n\nShe further claimed in a footnote that during a January meeting at which she and Bove were present, Adams' attorneys offered a quid pro quo in which Adams would \"assist with the Department's enforcement priorities only if the indictment were dismissed.\" She also alleged that Bove \"admonished\" a member of her staff for taking notes and \"directed the collection of those notes at the meeting's conclusion.\"\n\nSassoon concluded the letter by offering to resign if Bondi did not \"reconsider the directive.\"\n\n\"I have not spoken to [Sassoon],\" Bondi later told a reporter , \"but that case should be dropped.\" The following day, Bove accepted Sassoon's resignation and said she and the other prosecutors in her office would be investigated by the DOJ for \"disobeying direct orders implementing the policy of a duly elected President.\"\n\nThe entire affair reeks of the political favoritism that Trump inveighed against on the campaign trail. Sassoon, a Federalist Society member who clerked for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and was appointed to her position by Trump just days earlier, is clearly no leftist radical.\n\nBove's position, meanwhile, is nakedly political: He charges that Sassoon refused to dismiss a \"politically motivated prosecution\" despite admitting in his original memo that the DOJ had not \"assess[ed] the strength of the evidence or the legal theories on which the case is based\" and that \"this directive in no way calls into question the integrity and efforts of the line prosecutors responsible for the case, or your efforts in leading those prosecutors in connection with a matter you inherited.\"\n\nAt least six other federal prosecutors resigned before Bove found one willing to dismiss the charges against Adams. \"I expect you will eventually find someone who is enough of a fool, or enough of a coward, to file your motion,\" Hagan Scotten, an assistant U.S. attorney in Sassoon's office, wrote in his resignation letter to Bove. \"But it was never going to be me.\"\n\nBove also claimed in his second letter that Sassoon's accusation of a quid pro quo was \"false.\" But that very same week, Adams appeared on Fox & Friends with Tom Homan, Trump's border czar, who said the mayor had agreed to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement measures. \"If he doesn't come through,\" Homan said, \"I'll be in his office, up his butt saying, 'Where the hell is the agreement we came to?'\"\n\nNot only did Homan describe a literal quid pro quo, he even defined the \"quid\" and the \"quo\" on national television.\n\nMeanwhile, Edward Martin Jr., Trump's pick to head the U.S. Attorney's Office in the District of Columbia, has spent his first few weeks in office threatening investigations of his boss' political enemies.\n\nWhen media outlets reported on the identities of engineers working with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, Martin offered his office's services to Musk in letters posted on X. In one letter , Martin told Musk that his office would investigate anyone \"discovered to have broken the law or even acted simply unethically.\"\n\nMartin also sent letters to Democratic lawmakers, threatening to investigate fiery comments they made about political opponents. The letters were a farce: Each lawmaker's comments were well within the bounds of political speech protected by the First Amendment. In one case, the letter came nearly five years after the remarks in question, when Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said two conservative U.S. Supreme Court justices had \"released the whirlwind\" and would \"pay the price.\"\n\nThis week, Martin dropped his investigation into Schumer, but only after the DOJ reportedly refused his request to present the case to a federal grand jury.\n\nIn the meantime, Martin has busied himself with other abuses of his considerable power. As Reason has written , the Biden administration spent much of its final days in office approving as many grants and loans as possible from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) before Trump was sworn in. An EPA staffer admitted as much after the election, telling an undercover operative with the right-wing group Project Veritas, \"We're just trying to get the money out as fast as possible before they come in and stop it all.\"\n\nAn unseemly task, certainly, and ripe for abuse as administrators are likely to impose less scrutiny than usual on a shorter timeline. But ultimately, the agency was funded by an act of Congress and imbued with the authority to disburse the money.\n\nEPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced in February that $20 billion of EPA money was \"parked at an outside financial institution by the Biden EPA\"-later identified as the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund , a grant program for clean energy projects; the grants in question were designated to particular recipients but held and distributed by Citibank. Zeldin said this money was part of a \"scheme\" to conduct \"a rush job with reduced oversight,\" and he pledged to claw back the funds and \"get them back inside of control of government.\"\n\nThe Washington Post reported last week that FBI agents had questioned EPA employees about the distribution of the grant money. Denise Cheung, a 24-year veteran of the D.C. U.S. Attorney's Office and head of its criminal division, resigned when Martin apparently directed her to draft an order compelling Citibank to freeze the funds.\n\nCheung had discussed the order with the FBI's Washington field office, which \"issued a letter to the bank recommending a thirty-day administrative freeze on certain assets,\" Cheung explained in a resignation letter to Martin. She then received a call from Martin, in which he \"criticized that the language merely 'recommended' that a freeze of the accounts take place\" and \"directed that a second letter be immediately issued to the bank under your and my name ordering the bank not to release any funds in the subject accounts pursuant to a criminal investigation.\"\n\n\"When I explained that the quantum of evidence did not support that action, you stated that you believed that there was sufficient evidence,\" Cheung added. \"Because I believed that I lacked the legal authority to issue such [an order], I told you that I would not do so. You then asked for my resignation.\"\n\nMartin \"then personally submitted a seizure warrant application without any other prosecutors in his office that was rejected by a U.S. magistrate judge in D.C., who found that the request and accompanying FBI agent affidavit failed to establish a reasonable belief that a crime occurred,\" according to The Washington Post .\n\n\"That happens basically... never,\" writes Harry Litman, who served as a U.S. attorney under President Bill Clinton. \"I can't recall a single instance when it happened in a US Attorney's office where I was serving.\"\n\nMartin currently serves as the interim U.S. attorney, but Trump also nominated him to the post permanently, which will require Senate confirmation. He faces considerable headwinds from the opposition party: This week, Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee asked the D.C. Bar to investigate Martin's conduct since taking office.\n\nIn a letter last month, Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), the ranking member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, charged that Martin's public actions \"raise serious concerns that your new initiative is a pretext for misusing your office for political ends, threatening and intimidating critics of the Administration, and chilling constitutionally protected speech.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.)-who chairs that committee- praised Martin's nomination, saying it signaled that Trump \"wasted no time delivering on his promise to restore law and order in our capital city.\"\n\nIf Trump had come into office on a pledge to rid the DOJ of political persecution and ideologically motivated indictments, it would be a cause worth celebrating. But less than two months back in office, Trump's appointees have used the levers of federal power for his benefit in a manner that seems every bit as corrupt as the process Trump criticized on the campaign trail.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Democrats Refusing To Say They'd Accept a Trump Victory Aren't Helping\n\nElection 2024\n\nEric Boehm | 10.11.2024 4:30 PM\n\nFormer President Donald Trump's refusal to accept the results of the 2020 election and Sen. J.D. Vance's (R-Ohio) signaling that he'd have gone along with Trump's efforts to reverse the outcome are both reprehensible and undemocratic. Democrats have rightfully used that behavior to make the case that Trump and Vance ought not to be trusted with the awesome powers of the executive branch.\n\nBut you know what doesn't help to make that argument stick? Democrats also refusing to give clear answers about whether they would accept the results of an election.\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, told Axios that he would accept the results of the election if Trump \"won a free, fair, and honest\" race-then added that he \"definitely\" doesn't assume an apparent Trump victory would meet that standard.\n\nOther Democrats have offered similarly waffling responses, though they have stopped short of openly suggesting that a Trump victory could be subject to objections during the certification process, as Axios notes .\n\nIn the same vein, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) made headlines earlier this week for saying that the Electoral College \"needs to go\" and that the national popular vote should determine the outcome of a presidential election. Walz has since walked back those remarks .\n\nAnyone, including vice presidential candidates, has a right to express their opinions about the basic structure of America's elections, of course. But Walz's criticism of the proper constitutional mechanism for selecting a president sits awkwardly alongside the Democratic Party's attempt to portray this election as a stand against Trump's and Vance's disregard for that same constitutional process .\n\nThat's not to suggest an equivalence here. Trump's behavior (and that of his allies) in the wake of the 2020 election goes well beyond anything that Democrats have said or done within this same space-and that includes other indefensible behavior like Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacy Abram's unwillingness to accept her defeat in 2018. It is truly remarkable and telling that a question as simple as \"Who won the 2020 election?\" is regarded as a \"gotcha\" question by leading Republicans like Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-La.).\n\nAs an aside: Has Vice President Kamala Harris said whether she would accept the results of the election? She is the sitting vice president, which means she would step into the role Mike Pence played after the 2020 election and would oversee the certification process that confirms a possible Trump win. Her views on that seem kind of important. Polling shows that most Americans believe she would accept the results, but I cannot find an example of her being asked directly about that possibility.\n\nRegardless, this shouldn't be difficult for Democrats! If someone asks, \"Will you accept the results of this election?\" the answer is simple: \"Yes.\"\n\nThat's how it works. If you don't accept the possibility of losing, don't play the game-and make room for better candidates and officials who will respect the Constitution.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Democrats Are About to Rediscover the Value of the Filibuster\n\nFilibuster\n\nEric Boehm | 11.12.2024 12:35 PM\n\nThree years ago, Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and nearly 100 of her House colleagues signed a letter urging top Democrats in the Senate to take radical action.\n\n\"This is an existential moment for our country,\" Jayapal and the other House Democrats wrote . \"We cannot let a procedural tool that can be abolished stand in the way of justice, prosperity, and equity.\"\n\nThat procedural tool? The filibuster, which requires 60 voters for the Senate to pass most legislation-except for judicial nominations and some budget bills. The filibuster rule, those House Democrats argued in 2021, was preventing Congress from \"advancing critical legislation that can meet the needs of the people we represent.\"\n\nIt's a good thing the Senate Democrats didn't listen.\n\nIn the aftermath of last week's election, Republicans appear poised to have full control of the federal government starting in January. (Control of the House remains uncertain, but a slim GOP majority seems likely even though 16 races remain uncalled as of Tuesday morning.)\n\nAsked Tuesday whether she would still support ending the filibuster in this new political dynamic, Jayapal gave the obvious answer in a bit of an unexpected way.\n\n\"Am I championing getting rid of the filibuster now when the [GOP] has the trifecta? No,\" Jayapal said , according to HuffPost reporter Jennifer Bendery. \"But had we had the trifecta, I would have been.\"\n\nGive her some points for honesty, I guess.\n\nBut this sort of cynical opportunism is why the filibuster's days might be numbered. On both sides of the aisle, there is a worrying tendency to see anything that checks the power of a congressional majority (or a chief executive) as a problem to be solved, rather than a necessary limitation on the raw power of democracy. Those who take a more measured view of things-like Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), who played big roles in preserving the filibuster in the early days of the Biden administration-are heading for the door.\n\nThe uncertainty about who will take up their mantle makes it more essential than ever to keep this in mind: There is no world in which abolishing the filibuster makes it easier to pass the good laws without also making it easier to pass the bad laws-and that's true no matter how you'd personally identify what counts as \"good\" or \"bad.\"\n\nFurthermore, once the filibuster is gone, it will be gone. There's no such thing as a one-time elimination of the filibuster to just do a special thing. In the final stages of the campaign, Vice President Kamala Harris suggested that the Senate should get rid of the filibuster in order to pass protections for abortion rights. Other Democrats have called for ending the filibuster to restructure the Supreme Court. This is not realistic. There either is a filibuster rule or there isn't one, because (like all Senate rules) it is only as strong as the members' willingness to support it.\n\nDemocrats don't have to look back far into history to see how getting rid of the legislative filibuster would work out. In 2013, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) abolished the filibuster for lower-court judicial nominees, ostensibly to allow Democrats to confirm more of then-President Barack Obama's picks for the federal bench.\n\nHow did that work out? President Donald Trump and a Republican-controlled Senate installed nearly as many federal judges in four years as Trump's predecessor did in eight-causing endless howls from liberals about how the conservatives had reshaped the courts.\n\nIf only someone would have warned them that no one wins when you abolish the filibuster.\n\nAs that example from a decade ago makes clear, abolishing the filibuster is a particularly foolish thing for Democrats to do. Fair or not, it's undeniable that the Senate's structure is tilted in Republicans' favor . Why would a party already fighting an uphill battle for the majority want to do away with one of the most important institutional protections for the Senate's minority party?\n\nIt only makes sense if you're unable to understand that there will be another election in two years, and that no political majority is permanent. Or if, like Jayapal, you're utterly shameless.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Democrats Have a Better Option Than Biden\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProduced by 'The Ezra Klein Show'\n\n[You can listen to this episode of \"The Ezra Klein Show\" on the NYT Audio app , Apple , Spotify , Amazon Music , Google or wherever you get your podcasts .]\n\nA full transcript of this audio essay is available here:\n\nEzra Klein: My heart breaks a bit for Joe Biden. This is a man who has been running for president since he was young. He wins the presidency, finally, unexpectedly, when he's old. And that age brought him wisdom. It brought an openness that hadn't always been there in him. He's governed as a throwback to a time before \"I alone can fix it,\" a time when presidents were party leaders, coalition builders.\n\nBiden has held together a Democratic Party that could easily have splintered. Think back to the 2020 campaign, when he beat Bernie Sanders, when he beat Elizabeth Warren, when his victory was seen as, was in reality, the moderate wing triumphing over the progressive wing, the establishment over the insurgents.\n\nBut instead of making them bend the knee, instead of acting as a victor, Biden acted as a leader. He partnered with Bernie Sanders. He built the unity task forces. He integrated Warren's and Sanders's ideas and staff into not just his campaign but also his administration.\n\nI had a conversation recently with Pramila Jayapal, the chair of the House progressive caucus, and I asked her why the Democratic Party hadn't ruptured the way Republicans did. She pointed me back to that moment. Biden, she said, made this \"huge attempt to pull the Democratic Party back together before the 2020 election in a way I've really never seen before.\"\n\nAnd it worked. Democrats had 50 votes in the Senate. Fifty votes that stretched from Bernie Sanders on the left all the way to Joe Manchin on the right. Biden and Chuck Schumer, they often could not lose even one of those votes, and at crucial moments, they didn't.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "Democrats Need to Dig Deep\n\nThe party needs to rethink its policies, not its messaging.\n\nAudio versions are only available to subscribers of The Dispatch. Join Today ! to listen to this post.\n\nPolitics is about changing the world. To change the world, you need power so you can implement the policies you think will help people. And to win power, you need to be able to get votes.\n\nAll this is fairly obvious, but we live in a political era where obvious and true things bear repeating. So allow me to state the obvious once more: To win votes, you can't have wildly different views from the public. That's a lesson Democrats seem to have forgotten.\n\nIn the wake of their 2024 loss, a significant portion of Democratic leadership seems to believe that what the party really needs is to change the messaging. They need more aggressive PR, better catchphrases, more viral stunts. They need to go on more podcasts!\n\nBetter PR and messaging strategy would help. But the core thing that held Democrats back in 2024 wasn't PR strategy. It was the party's beliefs and policies. If Democrats want to win the kind of large and durable majorities that will allow them to really govern, they're going to have to rethink those policies.\n\nWhat has the Democratic Party been up to since losing the 2024 election? They've been focused on revamping their public image and messaging strategy.\n\nIn early February, party insiders elected gun control activist and progressive gadfly David Hogg as vice chair of the DNC. The 24-year-old's campaign, when it wasn't busy with pillow-related ventures , centered on the need for \" better outreach \" and more combative messaging. And during President Donald Trump's address to Congress on March 4, Democrats decided it would be a great idea to look like huge dorks by holding up homemade signs that said things like \"Musk Steals\" and color-coordinating pink and white outfits. One member yelled at Trump and was ejected.\n\nMeanwhile, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York have been on a tour to \"Fight Oligarchy .\" Bernie's always had the ability to draw large crowds, but the rallies offer little beyond repeating the same talking points about billionaires he's been using for years.\n\nIn the wake of the interminable debate about finding a Democratic Joe Rogan -never mind that Rogan himself used to be exactly that -aspiring Patrick Bateman impersonator Gavin Newsom started a podcast . It's gone terribly and his net approval is down 10 points among Democrats. To give one more on-the-nose example: Here's a survey I was recently served on Facebook from the Democrats:\n\nNotice anything interesting? There's a \"progressive\" option but no \"liberal\" or \"moderate\" options. There's virtually no mention of health care, no mention of Trump's disastrous tariffs, no mention of building more housing. There's no caucus for lowering the cost of living or for boosting economic growth. But at least we got \"AANHPI,\" an identifier no Asian person has ever used in their life. We got \"interfaith,\" a meaningless slop term for a party too afraid to offend anyone's religious sensibilities in any way. Disabled Native youth will be covered in triplicate. It's just a social media poll, but it's emblematic of how Democrats are still focused on messaging strategies and pleasing internal identity groups that very few Americans actually care about.\n\nDemocrats didn't lose in 2024 because they needed to do more outreach to disadvantaged communities or interest groups. Nor were they a few podcast appearances or viral stunts away from victory. They lost because voters could tell that over the course of several years, the party drifted far out of line with the public on a number of highly salient issues. Democrats became the party of nags, aggressively scolding anyone who didn't speak the correct woke parlance. Joe Biden presided over a genuine border crisis and a broken asylum system that he was far too slow to address. Movements like Defund the Police and the pro-Palestine campus protests originated from the far left, leaving even moderate Democrats associated with policies that were deeply unpopular with voters . And, in the midst of trying to defend losing cultural positions, the biggest Democratic-run cities and states were often poorly governed, suffering from pervasive homelessness, public disorder, and untenable costs of living.\n\nIf you're of the liberal or progressive persuasion, you don't have to like this trend to acknowledge that it has electoral repercussions. I've spent years highlighting the benefits of increased immigration . I believe immigration has made America stronger and more prosperous throughout its entire history, and that it can continue to do so. But when the public is screaming that border security is an issue, you can't lecture the problem away. You need to respond to the actual concerns of voters or you're going to lose.\n\nThere's a role for persuasion in politics, of course. But persuasion takes time. If an issue is 70/30 or 80/20 against your party, you need to moderate your stances until you can make your case and change minds. Remember the obvious points we started with. Politics is about changing the world. To change the world you need power, and to get power you need votes. Democrats, in too many areas, continue to deviate from public opinion-afraid to denounce the 20 end of an 80/20 issue in the polls for fear of offending an interest group.\n\nDemocrats do themselves no favors by not loudly condemning the excesses of wokeness, which are real if often exaggerated . They do urban voters no favors when they fail to loudly denounce Defund the Police because progressive activists might get mad at them. They do immigrants no favors when they fail to deal with the border crisis-we're now in a situation where soccer players with asylum court dates are getting deported to notorious third world prisons with no court hearings or due process . If your immigration stance brought you to this point, of what use was the stance?\n\nThat's not to say Democrats must abandon their liberal values-after all, Trump's takeover of the GOP has seen Republicans largely abandoning liberalism in favor of lawlessness. But Democrats do need to change. They can get visibly tougher on illegal immigration while still advocating for more legal pathways and the fair treatment of immigrants. They can focus on the LGBT rights that matter like non-discrimination in the workplace, non-discrimination in housing, and access to health care-rather than dying on dubious and unpopular niche issues like trans athletes in women's sports. They can loudly denounce the excesses of DEI (such as mandatory diversity statements for technical STEM research) while preserving diversity and inclusion ideas that still make sense (such as honoring civil rights heroes like Jackie Robinson). They can advocate for intelligent police reforms while still taking a hard stance against public disorder, crime, and anti-social behavior.\n\nAnd most importantly, Democrats need to come out full throttle against Trump's disastrous tariffs and promise to repeal them on day one. They need to become a party that actually cares about the cost of living, the housing crisis, and clean energy. If they want voters to trust them, Democrats must show that they can effectively run the cities and states they govern locally.\n\nAll these ideas require real policy change. It's likely to piss off several entrenched interest groups inside the party. Democrats should do it anyway.\n\nThe real danger, paradoxically, is that Democrats probably don't need to do any of this to win in the 2026 midterms. Thermostatic backlash is one of the strongest forces in American politics right now, and Trump's approval ratings are already cratering . Trump's administration is breaking things at an astonishing rate, his tariffs are causing chaos and are set to increase the cost of living , and the country may be barreling toward a recession. By 2026 the odds are that MAGA and Trump will be deeply unpopular and Democrats can coast to a midterm victory without having to change much of anything.\n\nBut that's not the path to a durable majority. That's a recipe for eternally getting 48 to 51 percent of the vote, a path where you flip a coin every four years to see if you got lucky this presidential cycle. Democrats need to aim for something more, and the only way to win larger majorities is to aim at the middle.\n\nKamala Harris, to her credit, seemed at least partially aware of this. She ran a decent campaign in 2024 that tried to reverse some of the leftward lurch of her party. She rarely emphasized her race or gender and moderated from the more left-leaning stances she took as a Democratic primary candidate in 2020. But three things dragged her down. First, the Democratic Party is often judged not just by what its leaders say but by the actions of activists, influencers, and academics who have collectively veered far to the left. That trend has been decades in the making, and for many voters, their perceptions of the party were already locked in place. Second, Harris' ill-fated turn as an ultra-progressive in the 2020 primary dampened the credibility of her 2024 turn toward the center. And third, Harris refused to break with Joe Biden. One of the defining moments of the 2024 campaign came when Harris told the ladies of The View that she couldn't think of a single thing she would have done differently from Biden. It was an act of political malpractice-Biden was deeply unpopular and when offered a chance to distance herself from him, she refused to do so.\n\nOther Democrats are attempting to point in a new direction. Gavin Newsom's podcast adventures show signs of moderation-he has denounced leftist positions on trans women in sports and tried to find common ground with conservatives. But unfortunately, his method for doing so has been to invite rabid MAGA partisans like Steve Bannon and Charlie Kirk and act like their buddies. That's not what the furious Democratic base wants-they want someone who will fight Trump with everything they've got, not lean into MAGA.\n\nThe left wing of the party is more than happy to fight. But they're still arguing that left-wing policies would be more popular if only we did more activism, or if only we had better messaging strategy. They often claim that by focusing on economic issues, they can duck hard conversations about immigration or culture, aiming for a new politics of evasion . Rather than listen to them, mainstream Democrats need to aggressively moderate. Many of these progressive activists have spent years warning that Trump and the MAGA movement pose a danger to our democracy. The activists are correct on that point, which raises an obvious question: If Trump is so dangerous, why in God's name have those activists spent the entirety of the Trump era sticking Democrats with hideously unpopular far-left positions?\n\nDemocrats can't evade the public on their unpopular positions by focusing on economic populism, by going on more podcasts, or by having a better ground game. At some point, you need to directly address those positions and break with the past. They need to fight Trump's illiberal and authoritarian power grabs, but do it while moderating their views. Until Democrats figure that out, they risk being stuck in the political wilderness.\n\nJeremiah Johnson is a contributing writer at The Dispatch, the co-founder of the Center for New Liberalism, and writer of the Infinite Scroll newsletter.\n\nYour membership includes the ability to share articles\n                with friends.

      "text": "The Democrats' Dilemma\n\nTheir problems run deeper than messaging.\n\nDear Reader (expect for those of you in a slippery situation ),\n\nWe make fun of Steve Hayes for many things here at The Dispatch . One of them is his dislike of provocative, or even clever, headlines. I think there was something in the water back at the old Weekly Standard , which inventively called its parody feature ... \"Parody.\" Then again, that might have made sense given that when the editors indulged their creative headline writing instincts, they'd come up with stuff like \" Corzine for a Bruisin' .\" So maybe sticking to a truth-in-labeling approach to headlines was a sign of self-awareness and restraint.\n\nHopefully you can forgive some old-school intramural ribbing from a longtime National Review guy.\n\nIn the meantime, what made me think of this was a fun headline from The Nation : \" Protesters Demand Action From Feckless Democrats .\"\n\nIt's no \" Headless Body in Topless Bar ,\" but it's got some punch and accuracy to it.\n\nI found the article about the protests outside the Treasury Department via my friend Jim Geraghty , who spotted this gem in the piece (emphasis mine):\n\nAs one after another member of Congress outlined the horrors perpetrated by Musk and his team of tech lackeys, protesters would shout back, \"Arrest them when they come out!\" and \"Lock him up!\" As the speeches continued, one especially plaintive chant took hold in the crowd: \"Tell us what to do!\"\n\nThat's a pretty good summary of the plight of the Democrats these days. The only thing that would have really completed the scene is if the elected Democrats speaking to the crowd chanted back, \"You tell us! Because we don't have a clue.\"\n\nThere's a lot of sweet, sweet, rank punditry about the plight of the Democrats-if you look for it. It's easy to miss while Elon Musk's minions treat the federal bureaucracy like they're celebrating Caddy Day at the Bushwood Country Club and Donald Trump floats the idea of turning Gaza into a Jimmy Buffett resort.\n\nWastin' away again in Gazaville Waitin' for Allah to turn the Jews into pillars of salt\n\n[Salt! Salt!]\n\nSome infidels claim we're the ones to blame All I know it's the Zionists' fault\n\nSorry about that.\n\nI think people are underestimating the problem facing the Democratic Party. I think it's much more fundamental than mere messaging or strategy. But let's get there by sticking with the punditry for a bit longer.\n\nThe Democratic Party hasn't been this unpopular in decades. It lost the White House, the House (albeit narrowly), and the Senate. It lost ground among pretty much every demographic group, which has to hurt for a party so obsessed with demographic groups.\n\nThis week, the Democrats elected a party technocrat and apparatchik, Minnesota Democratic Chair Ken Martin, to run the national party. Martin insists that they really don't need to change much. \"Anyone saying we need to start over with a new message is wrong,\" he told the New York Times . \"We got the right message.\"\n\nQuick, what was the Democrats' message in 2024? It's an honest question, because I really don't know. I couldn't  even remember what Kamala Harris' slogans were. I still remember \"I'm With Hillary\" and \"It's Her Turn,\" but I had to google for a bit to remember \"When we fight, we win!\" and \"We're not going back!\" Are these the messages that Martin thinks the Democrats can win on if they just put more money behind them?\n\nSlogans are supposed to conjure deeper philosophical or ideological commitments and passions. Other than the implied anti-Trump message in, \"We're not going back,\" the only conceptual superstructure I can identify is partisan team spirit. In other words, the \"we\" is basically just the Democrats or maybe \"progressives,\" or perhaps those of us who are not them. But that's about it.\n\nIn politics, broadly speaking there aren't that many organizing principles, or  ideological frameworks, that work at scale. I mean stuff like imperialism,  nationalism, or socialism. Ideas that can pull adherents in from a broad and diverse population.\n\nI guess the oldest is some form of tribalism: We're the people of this valley. We're not the mountain people or the river people or those stinking nomads. We're us, and everybody else is them.\n\nAs civilization progressed more sophisticated versions developed. We're the Romans, or the Etruscans, or Athenians. That kind of thing. Later it was the Christians, or the Muslims, etc.\n\nWith the rise of modern nationalism, the idea of the nation obviously became one of these categories or creeds of self-identification. Not long after nationalism arrived, socialism burst on the scene. Another category that emerged around this time might be called liberalism. And liberalism-the idea of individual rights, the rule of law, freedom from the state or hostile religious authorities-is an idea you can build a political movement around. These are all big ideas that inform how we understand the role of the state, but also how we should organize society more generally.\n\nNow, you can certainly find all of these in pure forms from ideologues and activists. But the truth is most ideologies borrow bits and pieces from each other. Historically, most nationalists were socialists. And when push came to shove, most socialists were also nationalists. Most early liberals were also nationalists of a kind. They wanted their respective nation-states to be liberal. It makes sense when you think about it, because the nation-state has a defined boundary-both in terms of physical borders and conceptually in terms of where the state has authority and where it doesn't. You can preach about workers of the world uniting, but workers are also Italians, Germans, Belgians, etc. And their respective governments only have authority within those borders.\n\nIdeology doesn't just inform policy positions and language. An ideology is also a worldview, which is why many dictionaries treat them as synonyms.\n\nProgressive ideology, broadly speaking, is historically very materialist. Doctrinaire Marxism, of course, is almost pure materialism. The means of production, and their ownership, defines the form and shape of civilization. Religion, nationalism, and other prisms are distractions, myths, \"opiates\" of the masses, and all that nonsense. What matters is stuff like money, food, housing, and material conditions, on the job and off. Contrary to a lot of right-wing hyperbole, not all progressives are committed Marxists. Indeed, very few of them are. But, broadly speaking, this focus on material circumstances informs progressive ideology deeply, and that's fine. It's not like that stuff doesn't matter. Indeed, it matters a lot. My objections to the progressive approach to public policy is not the desire to improve the material conditions of the poor or the working class. Most conservatives care about that stuff, too. We just disagree about the best ways to pursue similar goals.\n\nAnyway, for most of the last century or so progressives, broadly defined, saw politics through a largely materialist lens. Poverty was the all-purpose root cause for social ills. Everything flowed from that. FDR turned the state into a giant wealth-transferring machine-from Social Security to the first welfare programs to all of those government jobs and public works projects. The government was now in the business of redistributing wealth. The Great Society was a continuation of this framework. It wasn't socialism per se, but welfare-state liberalism drew on many of the same foundational assumptions. America's freedom-loving, you're-not-the-boss-of-me cussedness prevented it from ever accepting socialism outright.  But Americans ultimately accepted the idea that the wealth-creating features of capitalism would be yoked to a large amount of redistribution. I can criticize the excesses and errors all day long, but at the end of the day I subscribe to that basic idea of a capitalism-funded safety net or welfare state, just like almost everybody else.\n\nIn certain academic and ideological corners of progressive thought, this understanding started to get supplanted by what we can call here \"intersectionality.\" Race and gender, and the related ideas of \"oppressor-oppressed\" ideology, supplanted  the old New Deal/Great Society paradigm. The left still believed in a generous welfare state but grew bored talking about it. Things like anti-racism, the 1619 Project , DEI, were what drew passion and energy on the left.\n\nI don't think this is particularly controversial. You could see it almost in real-time. Social  democrats like Bernie Sanders, who is totally in his comfort zone talking about Medicare for All, had to start talking in the language of race and marginalized groups. He used to denounce \"open borders\" as a crazy libertarian Koch Brothers kind of idea , but the Democratic Party convinced itself that immigrants were now part of the coalition of the oppressed and they had the right to entry into America based upon their oppressed or marginal status.\n\nIn 2019 when he announced he was running for president, again, he was asked how he'd stand out in such a diverse field. \"We have got to look at candidates, you know, not by the color of their skin, not by their sexual orientation or their gender and not by their age,\" Sanders replied . \"I mean, I think we have got to try to move us toward a non-discriminatory society which looks at people based on their abilities, based on what they stand for.\"\n\nNot bad.\n\nThe left ate him alive. Even Stephen Colbert mocked him. \"Yes, like Dr. King, I have a dream-a dream where this diverse nation can come together and be led by an old white guy.\"\n\nThat sort of thinking, call it wokeism for want of a better shorthand, ran riot in elite culture and provided the foundation for the vast bulk of the culture war fights of the last decade. Some of those fights were stupid. Some weren't. Sometimes the left had good arguments and facts on their side, but more often, in my opinion, they didn't. The Rawlsian liberalism of the left ran head first into the traditional liberalism of American culture-and lost. I think that's why the \"vibe shift\" seems so much larger than warranted by the election returns.\n\nFor instance, this week Trump signed an executive order to keep transgender athletes from competing in girls' and women's sports. It was, in the words of CNN's Harry Enten , \"probably the most popular thing he's ever done.\" Large majorities of Independents and Democrats support it.\n\nOne can exaggerate the significance of this, but symbolically, the message is pretty clear. The intersectional argument just doesn't work as an organizing principle for politics-at scale. I want to be really clear: I'm not saying that bigotry is in the driver's seat. I don't think Americans would support a Jim Crow-style regime for transgender people. It certainly wouldn't support a Jim Crow-style regime for non-whites, or gays, or anything like that. But what turns off lots of Americans is special treatment-real or perceived-for specific groups. That goes for positive treatment and negative treatment. Allowing biological males to compete in women's sports simply seems unfair-one might even say \"illiberal\"-to many Americans, regardless of party affiliation. (See The Fair Jessica on this ).\n\nIntersectional progressives see the dismantling of DEI as oppressive and discriminatory. Oppressed groups deserve special treatment-\"equity\" not just \"equality.\" So the removal of a subsidy is indistinguishable from discrimination in their worldview. But that's not how large numbers of Americans see it. America is a liberal country and culture. Inherent in that liberalism is the idea that we're all equal in the eyes of God and government, and that means the state should not be in the business of picking winners and losers-based on race or creed or gender identity. (This is why the more extreme right-wing post-liberal schemes will fail. Americans will bristle at special treatment for certain faiths just as much as they bristle at special treatment for certain races or sexual orientations.)\n\nIt's fine if you disagree with that. There are good arguments to be made about where to draw lines.\n\nBut the simple fact is that as a practical political matter, the intersectional arguments have, at least for the time being, reached the point of diminishing returns. To reduce it to a simple point, calling Latinos \"Latinx\" repels more Latino voters than it attracts.\n\nWhich brings me back to the Democrats.\n\nAt a forum for candidates to chair the Democratic National Committee, Jonathan Capehart asked the contenders , \"So, I'm going to have a show of hands. How many of you believe that racism and misogyny played a role in Vice President Harris' defeat?\"\n\nAll eight candidates raised their hands.\n\nCapehart replied, \"Okay. So ... That's good, you all passed.\"\n\nNow, I've joined in the mockery over this. I love the idea that Capehart is some kind of official gatekeeper. Answer the riddle of the Sphinx or you shall not pass . But I will offer a very slight defense of the answer, even if I think the question is a symptom of the Democrats' plight. Of course racism and misogyny \"played a role\" in her defeat. She lost the popular vote by 1.5 percent. Would that margin have been smaller if there were zero racism and misogyny in America? Sure. Or at least, maybe. But come on.\n\nMoreover, this misses the point. For Capehart, racism and sexism are the salient issues. We judge politics not by the sum total of beliefs we hold but by the ideas we emphasize and talk about (for instance, for years, libertarians held all sorts of ideas, but the ones they organized around-chiefly drug legalization-defined them because that's what they talked about).\n\nThe more interesting question is: Did the price of gas or eggs play a more significant role than racism and misogyny in Harris' defeat? How about the withdrawal from Afghanistan? Or Joe Biden's age and infirmity? Or the border? Or, for that matter, did Harris' shortcomings as a candidate-distinct from her race and gender-contribute to her loss more than bigotry?\n\nI think the answers to all of those questions lie somewhere between \"probably\" and \"duh, of course.\"\n\nBut that's not what elite Democrats want to talk about.\n\nLet's assume a whole generation of Democratic and progressive activists, academics, and journalists can wean themselves of wokeism. That's a Herculean task for people trained to speak in the language and shibboleths of intersectionality. It's what they know. It's their comparative advantage. It's what got them jobs and tenure. But let's assume they can do it.\n\nWhat's their new theory of the case? What's their new categorical imperative, their ideological framework, that they can pitch to American voters? It's not nationalism. That's taken. It's not really patriotism either. That would require a wholesale reorientation toward the founding, the Constitution, and a rejection of all sorts of narratives that define progressivism. I'm not saying that progressives are unpatriotic, by the way, I'm saying that the deep language of patriotism is a dialect that requires practice. It's not socialism.\n\nThe only thing I can think of is a return to the old-style FDR-LBJ party of government approach. The government is there to help the little guy, the forgotten man, etc. The government is on your side. That's a language Democrats definitely know how to speak.\n\nAnd to be fair, this is an ideological framework that works-or can work-at scale. The Democrats definitely believe they can make it work again.\n\nBut there are problems. The first is credibility, or the lack thereof. The Democrats have been the party of government for so long, and government has gotten so big, that the Democrats seem less like the party that will use the government as a tool for you and more like the party that uses the government for us. Public sector unions run the Democratic Party to a considerable degree and are a massive source of its funding . And public sector unions have an inherent conflict of interest when it comes to reforming government. The left understands this in the narrow cases of prison guards and cops, but rejects it entirely everywhere else. Donor capture isn't just a problem for Republicans.\n\nOf course, it's not just public sector unions. Trial lawyers, environmental groups, civil rights groups-\"the groups\" generally see the government as their thing. Reforming it to deliver goods and services for everybody more effectively is a threat to their business models.\n\nAdd in the intersectional framing, and the problem gets even more acute. A more effective government wouldn't just help members of the Democratic coalition, it would help millions of people in the white working class who are not part of the coalition. I'm sure many progressives would be fine with that, but they'd have a hard time selling the idea to \"the groups.\"\n\nLast, there's the fact that the Republicans are no longer the strawman they're used to arguing with. Progressives have had a field day for generations casting the limited government, free-market message of the right as just so much \"greed.\"\n\n\"Give a man a fish and he eats for a day, teach a man to fish and he eats for a lifetime,\" is the morally and prudentially superior position. But politically it loses almost every time to \"Vote for me and I'll give you free fish!\"\n\nDonald Trump has turned the GOP into a free-fish party. I detest it, but it works. You can certainly argue that Trump won't be able to deliver, but conceptually, the no-taxes-on-tips, let-me-put-my-name-on-stimulus-checks guy is not the kind of opponent Democrats have a lot of muscle memory dealing with.\n\nAgain, I loathe the fact that Trump has turned the GOP into a protectionist, interventionist, industrial policy party. But I cannot deny that it deprives the Democrats a clear lane to march down. Rather than make a case for themselves, they thought that Trump would make their case for them. That strategy might still work in 2026 and 2028, but if you think Trump is a fraction as bad as most sincere Democrats do, it should shake you to the core that you managed to lose to him in 2024. The idea that \"we had the right message\" should be disqualifying.\n\nDemocrats don't see this yet. One argument we heard a lot after the election was this idea that Democrats just need their own Joe Rogan . Never mind that Democrats had Joe Rogan until they effectively chased him away. This is a very old crutch, with deep ideological assumptions behind it.\n\nWhen Republicans captured Congress in 1994, Democrats convinced themselves it was because Republicans had talk radio on their side. We just need our Rush Limbaugh! So progressives poured money into Air America, which was a bust. With the rise of Fox News, they convinced themselves they needed their own cable network (because apparently MSNBC, CNN, CBS, NBC, ABC, NPR, PBS, plus the New York Times , Washington Post , Time , Newsweek , U.S. News, etc. didn't count). So Al Gore launched Current TV. For a while progressives thought that conservative think tanks gave the right a structural advantage, so they created the Center for American Progress (missing the fact that conservative think tanks were created at least in part because vastly better-funded universities had become inhospitable to conservatives). Hell, some people thought the existence of a right-wing pillow company was some boon, so they launched a left-wing pillow company (one of its founders, David Hogg, is now a vice chairman of the DNC).\n\nTheir ideological priors made them think that they lost arguments and elections not because of a bad message but because they didn't have the right infrastructure.\n\nDemocrats are in a bad place not because they failed to get their message out but because voters didn't like the message or the messengers.\n\nThe sooner Democrats figure that out, the sooner they can get to work providing an alternative to Trumpism.\n\nCanine Update: This has been a very confusing time for the beasts. I got back from Belize on Monday morning and had to leave for a speech in Florida that night. The thing is, Kirsten parks the girls in the house in the mornings while she takes out the really small dog posse. So I've been home a couple mornings with the girls. They come back in the house and freak out that I'm here, complete with extensive dingo arooing. Then Kirsten comes and takes them for the midday walk and brings them back to her house. They're super happy to see me, almost as happy as I am to see them. And then ... back to the sleepover at Kirsten's. We're leaving town again tomorrow, and we didn't think we should move all of their stuff back only to ship 'em back over. It's all a bit disorienting for everybody. But they seem to be handling it well and having a grand time with Kirsten. Zoë has really cottoned to the idea that she's the boss of the wee ones. And Pippa has become basically Kirsten's lap dog , when she's not colonizing the couch . I'm very much looking forward to the end of all this travel and getting back to the routines of canine and feline domestic life. Oh, speaking of the feline, Gracie's doing great. She gets her own housesitter and doesn't have to worry about the dogs.\n\nOwner's Name: Brian Alderton\n\nWhy I'm a Dispatch Member: I've always considered myself a Reagan Republican. I became an independent who leaned conservative in the 2010s. When things went off the rails in 2016, I questioned everything I believed. I found Jonah and David French and they made tons of sense to me.

The son took care of her until he found a girlfriend. He spent less and less time with her. The family lived in a trailer in a neighboring state and already had two dogs. Gryzz spent much too much time in an undersized kennel. A mutual friend knew they wanted to rehome her and knew I was looking for a new sidekick since my previous dog had passed away suddenly a few months earlier. It was love at first sight for both of us and she came home with me about 30 minutes after meeting.\n\nPet's Likes: Walks, treats, everyone she meets, barking!\n\nPet's Dislikes: Squirrels, people who ignore her when walking by, and the stupid vacuum cleaner.\n\nPet's Proudest Moment: She went to an event at our local public pool, the Dog Splash (end-of-season event where dogs can swim at the pool). While she is quite an excellent swimmer, her energy was infectious and she led many of the dogs in attendance as the pacer dog. They all ran laps around the pool. I swear it looked like we were at the dog track.\n\nMoment Someone (Wrongly) Said Pet Was a Bad Dog: For my birthday, my brother had barbecue from Central BBQ in Memphis shipped to me. I had a pound of pulled pork thawing in the sink. Gryzzly managed to pull the pork out of the sink when I wasn't looking and ate the whole thing. It caused stomach issues, and what I woke up to that night was traumatizing to say the least.\n\nDo you have a quadruped you'd like to nominate for Dispawtcher of the Week and catapult to stardom?

      "text": "The Democrats' Dilemma\n\nTheir problems run deeper than messaging.\n\nDear Reader (expect for those of you in a slippery situation ),\n\nWe make fun of Steve Hayes for many things here at The Dispatch . One of them is his dislike of provocative, or even clever, headlines. I think there was something in the water back at the old Weekly Standard , which inventively called its parody feature ... \"Parody.\" Then again, that might have made sense given that when the editors indulged their creative headline writing instincts, they'd come up with stuff like \" Corzine for a Bruisin' .\" So maybe sticking to a truth-in-labeling approach to headlines was a sign of self-awareness and restraint.\n\nHopefully you can forgive some old-school intramural ribbing from a longtime National Review guy.\n\nIn the meantime, what made me think of this was a fun headline from The Nation : \" Protesters Demand Action From Feckless Democrats .\"\n\nIt's no \" Headless Body in Topless Bar ,\" but it's got some punch and accuracy to it.\n\nI found the article about the protests outside the Treasury Department via my friend Jim Geraghty , who spotted this gem in the piece (emphasis mine):\n\nAs one after another member of Congress outlined the horrors perpetrated by Musk and his team of tech lackeys, protesters would shout back, \"Arrest them when they come out!\" and \"Lock him up!\" As the speeches continued, one especially plaintive chant took hold in the crowd: \"Tell us what to do!\"\n\nThat's a pretty good summary of the plight of the Democrats these days. The only thing that would have really completed the scene is if the elected Democrats speaking to the crowd chanted back, \"You tell us! Because we don't have a clue.\"\n\nThere's a lot of sweet, sweet, rank punditry about the plight of the Democrats-if you look for it. It's easy to miss while Elon Musk's minions treat the federal bureaucracy like they're celebrating Caddy Day at the Bushwood Country Club and Donald Trump floats the idea of turning Gaza into a Jimmy Buffett resort.\n\nWastin' away again in Gazaville Waitin' for Allah to turn the Jews into pillars of salt\n\n[Salt! Salt!]\n\nSome infidels claim we're the ones to blame All I know it's the Zionists' fault\n\nSorry about that.\n\nI think people are underestimating the problem facing the Democratic Party. I think it's much more fundamental than mere messaging or strategy. But let's get there by sticking with the punditry for a bit longer.\n\nThe Democratic Party hasn't been this unpopular in decades. It lost the White House, the House (albeit narrowly), and the Senate. It lost ground among pretty much every demographic group, which has to hurt for a party so obsessed with demographic groups.\n\nThis week, the Democrats elected a party technocrat and apparatchik, Minnesota Democratic Chair Ken Martin, to run the national party. Martin insists that they really don't need to change much. \"Anyone saying we need to start over with a new message is wrong,\" he told the New York Times . \"We got the right message.\"\n\nQuick, what was the Democrats' message in 2024? It's an honest question, because I really don't know. I couldn't  even remember what Kamala Harris' slogans were. I still remember \"I'm With Hillary\" and \"It's Her Turn,\" but I had to google for a bit to remember \"When we fight, we win!\" and \"We're not going back!\" Are these the messages that Martin thinks the Democrats can win on if they just put more money behind them?\n\nSlogans are supposed to conjure deeper philosophical or ideological commitments and passions. Other than the implied anti-Trump message in, \"We're not going back,\" the only conceptual superstructure I can identify is partisan team spirit. In other words, the \"we\" is basically just the Democrats or maybe \"progressives,\" or perhaps those of us who are not them. But that's about it.\n\nIn politics, broadly speaking there aren't that many organizing principles, or  ideological frameworks, that work at scale. I mean stuff like imperialism,  nationalism, or socialism. Ideas that can pull adherents in from a broad and diverse population.\n\nI guess the oldest is some form of tribalism: We're the people of this valley. We're not the mountain people or the river people or those stinking nomads. We're us, and everybody else is them.\n\nAs civilization progressed more sophisticated versions developed. We're the Romans, or the Etruscans, or Athenians. That kind of thing. Later it was the Christians, or the Muslims, etc.\n\nWith the rise of modern nationalism, the idea of the nation obviously became one of these categories or creeds of self-identification. Not long after nationalism arrived, socialism burst on the scene. Another category that emerged around this time might be called liberalism. And liberalism-the idea of individual rights, the rule of law, freedom from the state or hostile religious authorities-is an idea you can build a political movement around. These are all big ideas that inform how we understand the role of the state, but also how we should organize society more generally.\n\nNow, you can certainly find all of these in pure forms from ideologues and activists. But the truth is most ideologies borrow bits and pieces from each other. Historically, most nationalists were socialists. And when push came to shove, most socialists were also nationalists. Most early liberals were also nationalists of a kind. They wanted their respective nation-states to be liberal. It makes sense when you think about it, because the nation-state has a defined boundary-both in terms of physical borders and conceptually in terms of where the state has authority and where it doesn't. You can preach about workers of the world uniting, but workers are also Italians, Germans, Belgians, etc. And their respective governments only have authority within those borders.\n\nIdeology doesn't just inform policy positions and language. An ideology is also a worldview, which is why many dictionaries treat them as synonyms.\n\nProgressive ideology, broadly speaking, is historically very materialist. Doctrinaire Marxism, of course, is almost pure materialism. The means of production, and their ownership, defines the form and shape of civilization. Religion, nationalism, and other prisms are distractions, myths, \"opiates\" of the masses, and all that nonsense. What matters is stuff like money, food, housing, and material conditions, on the job and off. Contrary to a lot of right-wing hyperbole, not all progressives are committed Marxists. Indeed, very few of them are. But, broadly speaking, this focus on material circumstances informs progressive ideology deeply, and that's fine. It's not like that stuff doesn't matter. Indeed, it matters a lot. My objections to the progressive approach to public policy is not the desire to improve the material conditions of the poor or the working class. Most conservatives care about that stuff, too. We just disagree about the best ways to pursue similar goals.\n\nAnyway, for most of the last century or so progressives, broadly defined, saw politics through a largely materialist lens. Poverty was the all-purpose root cause for social ills. Everything flowed from that. FDR turned the state into a giant wealth-transferring machine-from Social Security to the first welfare programs to all of those government jobs and public works projects. The government was now in the business of redistributing wealth. The Great Society was a continuation of this framework. It wasn't socialism per se, but welfare-state liberalism drew on many of the same foundational assumptions. America's freedom-loving, you're-not-the-boss-of-me cussedness prevented it from ever accepting socialism outright.  But Americans ultimately accepted the idea that the wealth-creating features of capitalism would be yoked to a large amount of redistribution. I can criticize the excesses and errors all day long, but at the end of the day I subscribe to that basic idea of a capitalism-funded safety net or welfare state, just like almost everybody else.\n\nIn certain academic and ideological corners of progressive thought, this understanding started to get supplanted by what we can call here \"intersectionality.\" Race and gender, and the related ideas of \"oppressor-oppressed\" ideology, supplanted  the old New Deal/Great Society paradigm. The left still believed in a generous welfare state but grew bored talking about it. Things like anti-racism, the 1619 Project , DEI, were what drew passion and energy on the left.\n\nI don't think this is particularly controversial. You could see it almost in real-time.

He used to denounce \"open borders\" as a crazy libertarian Koch Brothers kind of idea , but the Democratic Party convinced itself that immigrants were now part of the coalition of the oppressed and they had the right to entry into America based upon their oppressed or marginal status.\n\nIn 2019 when he announced he was running for president, again, he was asked how he'd stand out in such a diverse field. \"We have got to look at candidates, you know, not by the color of their skin, not by their sexual orientation or their gender and not by their age,\" Sanders replied . \"I mean, I think we have got to try to move us toward a non-discriminatory society which looks at people based on their abilities, based on what they stand for.\"\n\nNot bad.\n\nThe left ate him alive. Even Stephen Colbert mocked him. \"Yes, like Dr. King, I have a dream-a dream where this diverse nation can come together and be led by an old white guy.\"\n\nThat sort of thinking, call it wokeism for want of a better shorthand, ran riot in elite culture and provided the foundation for the vast bulk of the culture war fights of the last decade. Some of those fights were stupid. Some weren't. Sometimes the left had good arguments and facts on their side, but more often, in my opinion, they didn't. The Rawlsian liberalism of the left ran head first into the traditional liberalism of American culture-and lost. I think that's why the \"vibe shift\" seems so much larger than warranted by the election returns.\n\nFor instance, this week Trump signed an executive order to keep transgender athletes from competing in girls' and women's sports.

The Democrats have been the party of government for so long, and government has gotten so big, that the Democrats seem less like the party that will use the government as a tool for you and more like the party that uses the government for us. Public sector unions run the Democratic Party to a considerable degree and are a massive source of its funding . And public sector unions have an inherent conflict of interest when it comes to reforming government. The left understands this in the narrow cases of prison guards and cops, but rejects it entirely everywhere else. Donor capture isn't just a problem for Republicans.\n\nOf course, it's not just public sector unions. Trial lawyers, environmental groups, civil rights groups-\"the groups\" generally see the government as their thing. Reforming it to deliver goods and services for everybody more effectively is a threat to their business models.\n\nAdd in the intersectional framing, and the problem gets even more acute. A more effective government wouldn't just help members of the Democratic coalition, it would help millions of people in the white working class who are not part of the coalition. I'm sure many progressives would be fine with that, but they'd have a hard time selling the idea to \"the groups.\"\n\nLast, there's the fact that the Republicans are no longer the strawman they're used to arguing with. Progressives have had a field day for generations casting the limited government, free-market message of the right as just so much \"greed.\"\n\n\"Give a man a fish and he eats for a day, teach a man to fish and he eats for a lifetime,\" is the morally and prudentially superior position. But politically it loses almost every time to \"Vote for me and I'll give you free fish!\"\n\nDonald Trump has turned the GOP into a free-fish party. I detest it, but it works. You can certainly argue that Trump won't be able to deliver, but conceptually, the no-taxes-on-tips, let-me-put-my-name-on-stimulus-checks guy is not the kind of opponent Democrats have a lot of muscle memory dealing with.\n\nAgain, I loathe the fact that Trump has turned the GOP into a protectionist, interventionist, industrial policy party. But I cannot deny that it deprives the Democrats a clear lane to march down. Rather than make a case for themselves, they thought that Trump would make their case for them. That strategy might still work in 2026 and 2028, but if you think Trump is a fraction as bad as most sincere Democrats do, it should shake you to the core that you managed to lose to him in 2024. The idea that \"we had the right message\" should be disqualifying.\n\nDemocrats don't see this yet. One argument we heard a lot after the election was this idea that Democrats just need their own Joe Rogan . Never mind that Democrats had Joe Rogan until they effectively chased him away. This is a very old crutch, with deep ideological assumptions behind it.\n\nWhen Republicans captured Congress in 1994, Democrats convinced themselves it was because Republicans had talk radio on their side. We just need our Rush Limbaugh! So progressives poured money into Air America, which was a bust. With the rise of Fox News, they convinced themselves they needed their own cable network (because apparently MSNBC, CNN, CBS, NBC, ABC, NPR, PBS, plus the New York Times , Washington Post , Time , Newsweek , U.S. News, etc. didn't count). So Al Gore launched Current TV. For a while progressives thought that conservative think tanks gave the right a structural advantage, so they created the Center for American Progress (missing the fact that conservative think tanks were created at least in part because vastly better-funded universities had become inhospitable to conservatives). Hell, some people thought the existence of a right-wing pillow company was some boon, so they launched a left-wing pillow company (one of its founders, David Hogg, is now a vice chairman of the DNC).\n\nTheir ideological priors made them think that they lost arguments and elections not because of a bad message but because they didn't have the right infrastructure.\n\nDemocrats are in a bad place not because they failed to get their message out but because voters didn't like the message or the messengers.\n\nThe sooner Democrats figure that out, the sooner they can get to work providing an alternative to Trumpism.\n\nCanine Update: This has been a very confusing time for the beasts. I got back from Belize on Monday morning and had to leave for a speech in Florida that night. The thing is, Kirsten parks the girls in the house in the mornings while she takes out the really small dog posse. So I've been home a couple mornings with the girls. They come back in the house and freak out that I'm here, complete with extensive dingo arooing. Then Kirsten comes and takes them for the midday walk and brings them back to her house. They're super happy to see me, almost as happy as I am to see them. And then ... back to the sleepover at Kirsten's. We're leaving town again tomorrow, and we didn't think we should move all of their stuff back only to ship 'em back over. It's all a bit disorienting for everybody. But they seem to be handling it well and having a grand time with Kirsten. Zoë has really cottoned to the idea that she's the boss of the wee ones. And Pippa has become basically Kirsten's lap dog , when she's not colonizing the couch . I'm very much looking forward to the end of all this travel and getting back to the routines of canine and feline domestic life. Oh, speaking of the feline, Gracie's doing great. She gets her own housesitter and doesn't have to worry about the dogs.\n\nOwner's Name: Brian Alderton\n\nWhy I'm a Dispatch Member: I've always considered myself a Reagan Republican. I became an independent who leaned conservative in the 2010s. When things went off the rails in 2016, I questioned everything I believed.

The son took care of her until he found a girlfriend. He spent less and less time with her. The family lived in a trailer in a neighboring state and already had two dogs. Gryzz spent much too much time in an undersized kennel. A mutual friend knew they wanted to rehome her and knew I was looking for a new sidekick since my previous dog had passed away suddenly a few months earlier. It was love at first sight for both of us and she came home with me about 30 minutes after meeting.\n\nPet's Likes: Walks, treats, everyone she meets, barking!\n\nPet's Dislikes: Squirrels, people who ignore her when walking by, and the stupid vacuum cleaner.\n\nPet's Proudest Moment: She went to an event at our local public pool, the Dog Splash (end-of-season event where dogs can swim at the pool). While she is quite an excellent swimmer, her energy was infectious and she led many of the dogs in attendance as the pacer dog. They all ran laps around the pool. I swear it looked like we were at the dog track.\n\nMoment Someone (Wrongly) Said Pet Was a Bad Dog: For my birthday, my brother had barbecue from Central BBQ in Memphis shipped to me. I had a pound of pulled pork thawing in the sink. Gryzzly managed to pull the pork out of the sink when I wasn't looking and ate the whole thing. It caused stomach issues, and what I woke up to that night was traumatizing to say the least.\n\nDo you have a quadruped you'd like to nominate for Dispawtcher of the Week and catapult to stardom?

      "text": "Pro-Life Democrats Feel Shut Out of Party Influence\n\nWith their numbers dwindling, they hope to push for pro-family policies amid efforts to codify Roe v. Wade.\n\nCHICAGO-As Vice President Kamala Harris galvanizes the Democratic base, there is a group of the party's members who are not so high on her.\n\nThe pro-life Democrat is a vanishing species in American political life. When the activist group Democrats for Life of America began in 1999, it boasted 43 House Democrats as allies in its fight against abortion. Today, the only self-proclaimed pro-life Democrat in the House of Representatives is Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas. And while President Joe Biden showed some reluctance as he moved further to the left on abortion throughout his career, the leadership of Democrats for Life has little hope that his replacement on the 2024 presidential ticket will be as open to the pro-life argument.\n\n\"She needs to listen to what the other side is saying on this issue. The abortion lobby has her ear,\" Kristen Day, the group's executive director, told The Dispatch . Day's organization held a panel on Monday, the first day of the Democratic National Convention . There, speakers complained to about 15 attendees of feeling unwelcome in the Democratic Party due to their view of abortion.\n\nBiden's gradual shift toward backing abortion rights mirrors the party's evolution on the issue. Where he once voted to allow Congress and state legislatures to bypass Roe v. Wade and opposed taxpayer funding for abortion, he now supports the codification of the overturned Supreme Court decision into federal law and opposes the Hyde Amendment .\n\nSimilarly, where the Democratic Party once described its stance on abortion as \"safe, legal, and rare\" under the stewardship of President Bill Clinton in the 1990s, attendees at this year's convention could obtain free medication abortions and vasectomies from a regional Planned Parenthood arm. It filled all available appointments.\n\nIn addition to denouncing the availability of abortion at the convention, Day criticized Biden's record on the issue. She specifically named his administration's rulemaking around the Pregnant Workers' Fairness Act, which shoehorned abortion into a regulation after Sen. Bob Casey, one of the bill's sponsors, said the executive branch could not do so. However, she said Harris is \"definitely worse\" than Biden on the abortion issue.\n\n\"I'm very, very worried about a Harris administration when it comes to protecting women,\" Day said. She pointed to Harris' investigation as California attorney general of anti-abortion activist David Daleiden-who covertly recorded Planned Parenthood employees and accused them of selling body parts of aborted babies-and her \" attacks \" on pro-life pregnancy centers in her home state.\n\nAs Day lamented the decline in the number of pro-life Democrats over the years, the panel featured just such a former congressman: Dan Lipinski, who represented Illinois for eight terms until he lost a 2020 primary to a challenger backed by pro-abortion groups. Lipinski accused Harris of not making room for pro-life members of her party.\n\n\"I just saw a quote the other day from one of my former colleagues who talked about how Vice President Harris is really presenting a big tent right now,\" he said in his remarks. \"But, clearly, this big tent does not include pro-life Democrats, so we ask the Democratic Party to practice what it preaches-inclusivity-and that means the party needs to welcome pro-lifers.\"\n\nLike Day, he expressed concerns about Harris' embrace of abortion rights, noting that she became the first vice president to visit an abortion clinic earlier this year.\n\nBut, notably, while speakers expressed their dismay at any expansion of abortion access, they did not focus on restricting abortion at the federal level. Instead, they promoted proposals to \"make birth free\" and offer federal support for families.\n\nA memorandum Day prepared has several pillars of a \"Democratic Party for everyone.\" They include welcoming pro-life Democrats, a call to \"stop attacking pregnancy resources centers,\" and programs such as an expanded child tax credit, paid family leave, and financial support for working families during pregnancy. It also endorses some pieces of legislation Republicans have proposed .\n\nDay said she was focusing on such priorities since a federal abortion restriction is unlikely to garner the 60 votes in the Senate it needs to pass.\n\n\"I think we need to look for things that are possible,\" Day told The Dispatch . \"Making birth free is possible. Providing resources to women on college campuses ... That's possible, and I think we're looking at what we can do and not what we can't. What we can't do right now is pass an abortion limitation bill on the federal level.\"\n\nThe Democratic Party platform that delegates at the convention approved Monday focuses on reinstituting Roe through legislation, repealing the Hyde Amendment, and continuing to support access to medication abortion. It contains some family financial support programs similar to the ones in Day's memo.\n\nMeanwhile, the GOP has largely backed off the effort to establish federal protections for unborn children. Republicans last month stripped much of the historical abortion language from their party platform in favor of ambiguous wording that centered the issue on the states. Lipinski acknowledged that many pro-life voters were dissatisfied with that decision.\n\n\"The problem is that Republicans went from having 32 mentions of abortion in their last platform to having one ... . They have some gobbledygook about the 14th Amendment, which makes no sense at all,\" he said. \"There's a lot of pro-life voters who are very unhappy about that, but if the Democratic Party is not going to open the door a crack to pro-life voters, I think they're just going to go and vote Republican.\"\n\nStill, though he twice voted in favor of an ill-fated abortion bill that would have effectively instituted a federal ban on the procedure after 20 weeks of pregnancy-a point after which the legislation stated a fetus can feel pain-Lipinski said it was not likely that his party would take up a federal restriction.\n\n\"I don't think that's where it would be fruitful for us to talk about it,\" he said. \"I mean, we each have our own opinions. I have my opinions. I've written about my opinions on this, but I don't think that is really helpful to us here, because, right now, we just want the Democratic Party to accept people who are pro-life, and, from there we can see where it goes.\"\n\nCharles Hilu is a reporter for The Dispatch based in Virginia.

      "text": "Tea for Two\n\nIs a Democratic Tea Party emerging?\n\nAudio versions are only available to subscribers of The Dispatch. Join Today ! to listen to this post.\n\nEven when he's right, it's hard to sympathize with Chuck Schumer.\n\nAnd I do think he's right on the merits to steer Democrats away from a government shutdown . They \"don't have the cards,\" to borrow a phrase from another recent national fiasco .\n\nIt isn't just the ideological differences I have with him that make sympathy difficult. It's the fact that he's terrible at retail politics. He's taken a bad situation for his party and made it worse.\n\nOn Thursday he published an op-ed explaining why he'll support the House GOP's bill to fund the government through September. It's awful, awful, awful legislation, he assured his base, but the alternative would be worse. If the government shuts down, Elon Musk and his flying monkeys will have a pretext to DOGE-ify the entire federal bureaucracy by shuttering the left's favorite agencies and furloughing thousands of workers. And when the shutdown ends, they'll get to decide who comes back to the job and who's permanently expendable.\n\nA shutdown standoff would also be a gift to Donald Trump by diverting public attention from the dumbest trade war in history. \"Right now, Mr. Trump owns the chaos in the government,\" Schumer wrote. \"He owns the chaos in the stock market. He owns the damage happening to our economy. The stock market is falling, and consumer confidence is plummeting.\" We've all heard the old saying about what to do when your enemy is making a mistake. Well, Trump is making a mistake by tariff-ing global investors into a panic. Schumer is acting accordingly.\n\nBesides, if Democrats did shut down the government, we all know Trump would eventually convince 50 percent of the country that doing so somehow caused the market correction that's already happened.\n\nI think Democratic voters might have grudgingly tolerated a capitulation by their leader in the Senate if Schumer had been clear about his intentions all along. But he wasn't, because he's terrible at politics.\n\nLiterally one day before announcing his support for the Republican legislation, he was heard telling reporters that his caucus was \" unified \" in supporting a 30-day funding alternative instead. Nor did he show his cards when the GOP's bill came up for a floor vote in the House, despite the fact that numerous Democrats from reddish Trump-friendly districts were preparing to risk their necks by opposing it. Imagine casting a vote in the name of party solidarity that you know will be unpopular back home-only to find out that doing so was pointless because the Democratic leader in the other chamber was planning to help Republicans pass their bill anyway.\n\nHaving opposed the GOP funding legislation almost unanimously, House Democrats are now a little miffed at Schumer. And by \"a little miffed,\" I mean \"thinking of marching into the Senate to confront him and lining up primary challengers for his next election in New York.\" Social media on Friday was a volcano of grassroots outrage at his betrayal after he raised their hopes that the party was about to fight, fight, fight by forcing a shutdown on a president they despise-and then wimped out.\n\nEvery conservative of a certain age who's watching this play out is thinking the same thing: I've seen this movie before .\n\nFormer Republican strategist Rory Cooper is one such conservative. On X on Friday, he summarized the current Democratic disarray with sarcasm: \"A political party divided over shutting the government down, and the base of the party doesn't think leadership is fighting hard enough, and leadership has almost no options. First time?\"\n\nIt's not his first time, nor mine. This is the stuff of which Tea Parties are made.\n\nMany left-wingers who are furious today at Schumer are leaning into the parallel. \"I would not be surprised to see, if not quite a Tea Party equivalent, a wave of challengers against old Democratic incumbents in particular,\" the leader of one progressive activist group warned the New York Times . \"It is not going to be ideological. It's going to be style.\" Search Twitter and you'll find angry commentary about the Democrats' Senate surrender littered with similar references .\n\nThe analogy is obvious.\n\nIn 2008, burdened by an unpopular president and economic turmoil, Republicans lost the White House and both houses of Congress. The party was left with an identity crisis and a morale problem. Bushism was exhausted and discredited, and a charismatic \"transformational\" president from the other party looked poised to make the GOP a minority indefinitely with the new coalition he had built.\n\nThe Tea Party was the right's solution to the morale problem. Lacking a national political leader, it fomented an angry populist backlash to the president's agenda. In doing so it eased the Republican identity crisis for a while, as Barack Obama's agenda polarized Tea Partiers into Reaganesque demands for smaller government and \"constitutional conservatism.\" Only later, in 2016, would it become clear how threadbare and opportunistic that identity was.\n\nWhat was novel about the Tea Party was that it blamed its own side's \"out of touch\" political establishment for America's failures as much as it did the other's.\n\nBecause the right's reaction to Obama cosplayed as an ideological reawakening, congressional Republicans were derided as turncoats and deemed part of the problem if they strayed toward the center on policy. But in reality, populist venom for moderate \"Republicans In Name Only\" was as much a reaction to style as substance. Conciliatory GOPers who preferred to work with Democrats instead of confronting them aggressively-who weren't willing to \"fight\"-were marked for political death via primary challenges. They would be replaced in time with uncompromising obstructionist blowhards who set unachievable goals and then, once elected, duly failed to achieve them.\n\nIf you followed politics between 2009 and 2015, that's the movie you watched. Today it feels like we're watching the sequel.\n\nIn 2024, burdened by an unpopular president and economic turmoil, Democrats lost the White House and both houses of Congress. The party has been left with an identity crisis and a morale problem. Culturally progressive educated-class neoliberalism, as embodied by Kamala Harris, seems exhausted and discredited. A charismatic \"transformational\" president from the other party aims to make Democrats a minority indefinitely with the new blue-collar coalition he's building-or, perhaps, by accruing autocratic power incrementally until the constitutional order disintegrates.\n\nInto that crucible walks the Senate Democratic leader, the very face of the liberal establishment, declaring that he won't use the one bit of leverage his party still has over federal policy. He prefers to work with Republicans, however reluctantly, instead of confronting them aggressively in the name of achieving some goal that not only won't be achieved but that no one seems able to define.\n\nThe left is spoiling for a fight to solve its morale problem, and Chuck Schumer won't give them one. The \"out of touch\" Democratic establishment begins to look like as much of a problem as Republicans are. ( The numbers don't lie! ) To force that establishment to take a more combative attitude toward the enemy, the base reasons that it may have no choice but to primary Schumer. We've seen this movie before.\n\nThere are other symmetries. Angry audiences at congressional town halls? The original Tea Party had plenty of those . So does the new one . Performative outbursts during presidential addresses to show defiance for the cameras? Tea Party 1.0 and Tea Party 2.0 have that in common as well. Scapegoating a Senate leader as the establishment villain-in-chief? The original Tea Party had that . Ditto for Schumer and the new version. Orchestrating a government shutdown that won't accomplish anything useful except to show how angry the out-party is?\n\nThe first Tea Party gave us that in 2013 and it ended up making a national figure of one ambitious populist . The new Tea Party wants another with a hero of its own .\n\nThe Tea Party of 2009 to 2015 didn't crave more conservative government. It craved resistance. It was born in a spirit of resistance and thus it expected its representatives to resist always and everywhere. It was an expression of populist id, and so naturally it came to despise the institutional superego in all forms. Its core belief was that politics is a matter of will: All it had to offer was will, therefore every political problem became a test of conviction.\n\nIn time it betrayed everything it claimed to stand for and, in its current decrepit authoritarian form, has driven the country to the brink of economic and civic ruin. Can you sense how excited I am to see the Democratic analogue?\n\nIn fairness, it isn't a perfect analogue.\n\nOne difference between the old Tea Party and the new one is the circumstances of its birth.\n\nUnlike in 2008, the losing party wasn't bludgeoned at the polls last November and relegated to a filibuster-proof rump in the Senate. The president may be under the impression that he won the biggest, strongest, most beautiful landslide ever, but the hard truth is that he failed to reach 50 percent against a lackluster opponent who was saddled with inflation and a dead-weight incumbent.\n\nDemocrats have real policy failures to address, starting with their negligence on the border and their indulgence of \"woke\" shibboleths that many Americans find alienating. But unlike the GOP 17 years ago, they have nothing on the order of the Iraq war, the Hurricane Katrina debacle, or the financial crisis to answer for. Because they're not as desperate for a radical change in direction as the original Tea Party was, their new Tea Party might not be as radical in nature.\n\nA second difference, related to the first, is that Democrats seem to understand that they need to move to the center. That wasn't so for the first Tea Party.\n\nThe swerve back toward Reaganite conservatarianism in 2009 was driven by a sense that Republican leaders had too often painted in ideological \"pale pastels\" instead of the \"bold colors\" that the Gipper endorsed . George W. Bush was a center-right establishment dynast, son and heir to a \"pale pastel\" president, and his job approval stood at 25 percent on Election Day 2008. The GOP's candidate on the ballot that year was John McCain, a soft-on-immigration Senate dinosaur, and his opponent ended up winning the largest number of popular votes in American history to that point. Then, in 2012, with the Tea Party dominant, Republicans somehow nominated a former governor of Massachusetts(!) who had pioneered a health-insurance reform that inspired Obamacare.\n\nRight-wingers could look at Bush, McCain, and Mitt Romney and reasonably surmise from election results that centrism was a loser. Bolder ideological colors of the sort that produced midterm landslides in 2010 and 2014 for the Tea Party were the trick. And so, in 2016, Republican voters chose bolder colors. Boy, did they ever.\n\nThe lessons are different for modern liberals. Joe Biden was a \"pale pastel\" compared to the boldly colored Bernie Sanders and not only did he defeat Trump, he set a new record for popular votes in doing so. Meanwhile, below the surface, blue-collar voters who had dependably voted Democratic in the past were beginning to drift right, scared off by creeping left-wing radicalism about open borders, defunding the police, and transgenderism. That nearly cost the party a victory in 2020 and quite possibly did cost it a victory in 2024 .\n\nThe sense that Democrats have moved too far left is shared by Democrats themselves. Last month Gallup found that the share who believe the party should become \"more moderate\" had jumped since 2021, rising from 34 percent to 45 percent. The share who said that it should become \"more liberal\" declined over the same period, from 34 percent to 29.\n\nEven if a new left-wing Tea Party gets off the ground, political reality should make it less likely to radicalize than its right-wing forebear. To win a Democratic primary, a Tea Party candidate will presumably need to meet the growing demand for moderation among the party's voters that was absent in the GOP circa 2009. As the progressive activist I quoted earlier told the Times , the new movement \"is not going to be ideological. It's going to be style.\"\n\nIt's a nice thought, at least. Others seem to share it . I hope it works out for them! But I don't think it will.\n\nI find it hard to believe that an insurgent political movement bent on dethroning its party's establishment can be aggressive \"stylistically\" without becoming aggressive ideologically too.\n\nThe fact that the primary challenger of choice for Chuck Schumer looks to be Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez proves the point. If all liberals are looking for is a pugnacious contrast in \"style\" with the senator, it seems weird that they're rallying behind the most prominent young socialist in the country, no?\n\nThe nature of a Tea Party points remorselessly toward policy radicalism. Imagine how absurd it would be if Schumer's challenger declared during a primary debate, \"I agree with him on everything, except that we really need more shutdowns.\" Try as one might to be radically combative about tactics yet substantively moderate about policy, the ethic of \"fighting\" on which such movements are founded-especially fighting members of their own party establishment-will inevitably encourage \"fights\" over policy as well. Inevitably, the challenger's need to distinguish himself as a \"bold\" alternative to the incumbent will lead him to endorse bolder colors on policy as well.\n\nAnd if you end up getting elected for your willingness to \"fight,\" you can't be a voice of restraint in Congress without betraying your mandate. That probably explains why so many right-wing Tea Partiers slid easily from \"constitutional conservatism\" into whatever the hell Mike Lee is now . Trump's politics work just as well as Reagan's if all you're looking to do is fight, so it was easy for Tea Party populists to shift from one to the other despite the ideological incongruity. When you're in Congress to stick it to the enemy, the important thing is to stick it to them; it doesn't much matter what shape the stick happens to take.\n\nSo if Republicans propose a reasonable-ish compromise in some policy dispute that establishment Democrats are inclined to accept, a Tea Party Democratic congressman sent to Washington to \"fight\" will reflexively conclude that that compromise is a nonstarter.\n\nThe ethic of resistance becomes an end in itself. After 16 supremely moronic years, I think our country has had more than enough of it.\n\nCombative contrarianism wouldn't be the only radicalizing influence on a Democratic Tea Party either. Age gaps will also be a factor. Given the public's post-Biden disquiet about American gerontocracy, it's a cinch that left-wingers recruited to challenge figures like Schumer will be much younger in order to underline how \"out of touch\" the current Democratic leadership is. Young politicians aren't prone to restraint and moderation in the best circumstances, but the age difference will further encourage them to offer fresh, daring, exciting ideas on policy in contrast to the elderly incumbent's pale pastels.\n\nAnd then there's Trump.\n\nFundamentally, the left's desire to oust Schumer is driven by the sense that, like Michael Corleone, they need a \"wartime consigliere .\" Trump is waging a war of sorts on the federal government and will wage one in due course on the entire constitutional order, and an old man who feebly chants \" we will win! \" yet shirks from the first opportunity for battle just ain't gonna cut it as commanding general. Even more so than in his first term, Trump is destined to negatively polarize liberals against his policy positions. Which means that a Tea Party candidate will have cover to tack to the left in a Democratic primary-and possibly even an incentive to do so-despite any early vows of moderation.\n\n\"Is this a crisis or not?\" a frustrated David Graham wrote of Schumer's decision to oppose a shutdown. That's the unofficial motto of any insurgent political movement that prioritizes \"fighting\" over the goals it's ostensibly fighting for. And the thing about a crisis mentality is that, once you adopt it, every form of radicalism is justified in the name of ending the crisis, including radicalism on policy. You would think Americans would have learned their lesson by now, but evidently not. Here we go again.\n\nNick Catoggio is a staff writer at The Dispatch and is based in Texas.

      "text": "Can Democrats Govern?\n\nAt least on the state level, Republicans look relatively competent.\n\nHow in the heck did the Republicans become the party of good governance?\n\nRelatively good, I mean.\n\nThe joke about the GOP used to be that Republicans campaigned on the belief that government doesn't work and then worked hard to prove that once in office. The Republicans were, for a long time, a party that really did only one thing in power: cut taxes. Republicans didn't cut spending, didn't reform entitlements, didn't radically reorganize government along lines of greater efficiency or accountability, but they would-whether it was economically appropriate or not-cut taxes when given the chance. Even Donald Trump, who promised to be (and, unfortunately, is) a different sort of Republican, did almost nothing else with Republicans' 2017 trifecta except sign into law an utterly conventional Republican tax bill put together by Paul Ryan.\n\nDemocrats are the party of government employees. But the party of the bureaucrats isn't necessarily good at bureaucracy-and, in spite of the low reputation of the word \"bureaucracy,\" there is no substitute for effective, competent bureaucracy in a free society. Ultimately, competent bureaucratic administration is what determines whether schools are worth a damn or the trash gets picked up.\n\nOr whether, instead, wildfires are permitted to burn out of control.\n\nDemocrats' reputation as a party of governance is at a low ebb just now, and it isn't only their incompetence in California. The wildfire story isn't primarily a policy story or a political story-wildfires have ravaged California since prehistoric times-but thinking people with a little bit of long-term memory might ask themselves how it is that Ron DeSantis' government in Florida always seems about as prepared for hurricanes as they can be-down to having extra linemen and equipment pre-positioned to swoop in and restore electricity service-while in California the Palisades reservoir has been out of commission for nearly a year because of a defective \"covering designed to preserve water quality,\" i.e., a torn tarp.\n\nThomas Jefferson believed that \"the best government is that which governs least,\" which is a sentiment dear to my libertarian heart. And, while it is not exceptionlessly true, there is a lot of truth to that maxim: My native Texas is not what I would call an especially well -governed state, but it is not in most things a much -governed one, at least at the state level. And that seems to work about well enough.\n\nHere's one way to think of the current state of affairs: These United States have altogether about 335 million people living in them, but 1 in 3 of those millions live in California, Texas, Florida, or New York. I suspect that it is really in these states that the relative reputations of the red-state model and the blue-state model are being made, in the main.\n\nFlorida was for a long time a kind of a political mystery: It was a purple state by the numbers but one in which Democrats couldn't win an election to save their lives. Florida is many things to many people, but one of the things it is is what you get when you have more or less unified control of state government by Republicans who-this part is critical-have a living memory of real political competition.\n\nDemocrats have not got a whiff of the governorship in Texas since 1995, haven't controlled the state Senate since 1997, and have basically been relegated to the kiddies' table in the state House since 2003. Republicans have enjoyed similar dominance for a similar time in Florida , but the elections have been a lot closer, and Florida has sent a Democrat to the U.S. Senate as recently as 2012. And Texas is a little more Republican and a little less Democratic than Florida. (The Pew numbers are not what you'd expect , showing a small Democratic affiliation advantage in both Texas and Florida. Color me skeptical.) Texas Republicans are, in my experience, more confident in the durability of their commanding position than their Florida counterparts are. That confidence may be misplaced, but that's for another column.\n\nFlorida has enjoyed a string of very competent governors with a strong orientation toward ensuring the reliable delivery of state services and encouraging a business-friendly tax and regulatory environment. Jeb Bush, Rick Scott, and Ron DeSantis are very different kinds of men and politicians, but all did very fine executive work in Florida. And Florida remembers. George Bush and Rick Perry were popular in Texas for a reason; and, while I don't know anybody who points to Greg Abbott and his circle as the personifications of administrative excellence (and Texas politics is fertile ground for grotesques such as Ken Paxton), it is hard to argue with the state's growth and its generally attractive economic environment-though housing affordability has become more of a problem in the Lone Star State as the workforce grows faster than the housing supply.\n\nTexas and Florida tend to lead the lists when it comes to rankings of business-friendliness, as indeed do Republican-leaning states generally . California and New York are not at the bottom of those lists, but they aren't at the top, either, in spite of being home to premier cities such as New York City and economic powerhouses such as Silicon Valley.\n\nPerversely, Republican governors other than George W. Bush have had a hard time of it as presidential contenders in recent years, precisely because good governors must perforce do a lot of clear-eyed, nonideological, necessarily bipartisan work- governor stuff -that irritates ideologues and hyperpartisans. The kind of thing that might read as \"bipartisan pragmatism\" to the general electorate reads as \"sellout\" to GOP primary voters. But their big-state Democratic colleagues lately spend a lot more time auditioning for Jonah Goldberg's \"parliament of pundits\" than they do making a good job of governor stuff. California's Gavin Newsom acts like he's running for secretary general of the United Nations half the time, and New York's Kathy Hochul cannot muster the courage of her convictions even when she happens upon something that is both good policy and popular with her progressive allies, such as congestion pricing , which she has partly undermined, out of pure political cowardice , by reducing the toll from $15 to $9. (Want to actually change commuters' behavior? Try $40. Want a real radical change? Try $200.) Meanwhile California burns, and the State of New York cruelly reminds residents of the state of New York, which isn't exactly what anybody wants it to be.\n\nAnd so Republicans do, amazingly enough, appear to be the party of slightly but meaningfully better state governance. If mostly by default.\n\nKevin D. Williamson is national correspondent at The Dispatch and is based in Virginia.

      "text": "The End of Politics\n\nHakeem Jeffries had better eat his Wheaties.\n\nAudio versions are only available to subscribers of The Dispatch. Join Today ! to listen to this post.\n\nWhen was the last time I wrote about Democrats in this newsletter?\n\nThe question occurred to me because, for once, the top news in politics today has to do with the out-party and I was struck by how rare that's been since January 20-or even November 5. So I skimmed the archives.\n\nMy last piece about the left was published on February 26 . My last piece about congressional Democrats came alllllll the way back on January 10 .\n\n\"That's because you have Trump Derangement Syndrome,\" a populist would say. Nuh uh. TDS no longer exists , assuming it ever did.\n\n\"It's because Republicans control the presidency and both houses of Congress,\" a more sensible reader would note. The only shred of federal power Democrats enjoy right now is the Senate filibuster, and even that carries exceptions for presidential nominees and legislation subject to budget reconciliation. If you're writing about national politics, how much is there to say about a faction that wields practically zero influence over national politics?\n\nI mean, I haven't written about the Libertarian or Green Parties lately either. What's the difference?\n\nOkay, fine: There's a difference. Unlike the Libertarians and Greens, Democrats can shut down the government by filibustering the House funding bill that'll soon hit the Senate floor. And given how tough even the moderates in their conference are talking, it sounds like they're ready to pull the trigger.\n\nIt's a big risk! It's risky politically for them because they're on the wrong side of a \"clean\" funding bill this time, the kind of no-frills legislation they normally demand of Republicans whenever the GOP starts agitating for spending cuts. Good luck convincing Americans that Trump is to blame for agencies shutting down when he's simply asking Democrats to extend Biden-era appropriations for another six months. A shutdown would also undercut left-wing attacks on DOGE: If keeping federal workers on the job is so important, why are liberals creating a situation that will require thousands of them to be furloughed?\n\nIt's risky policy-wise too. Politico reported on Thursday that White House officials are relishing the idea that \"when coffers run dry, the Trump administration-specifically [Russell] Vought, the longtime cost-cutting conservative now running OMB-would have unprecedented flexibility to choose which agencies get to stay open and which don't.\" Bureaus that are beloved by the left, like the Environmental Protection Agency, will presumably be the first to be shuttered. And many workers across the federal government who end up furloughed will probably not be invited back by Vought and Elon Musk when the standoff ends.\n\nEven the Democratic endgame is unclear. Unless the public reacts to a shutdown by siding decisively with them against Trump, the minority party will eventually be forced to capitulate by agreeing to the same sort of \"clean\" funding bill they're preparing to filibuster right now.\n\nThere's very little upside to what Democrats are poised to do. So why do they sound gung ho to do it ?\n\nI think they're desperate to reassure themselves that American politics isn't, well, over. But it is, mostly. At least for the next few years.\n\nTo understand why the current moment differs from typical one-party rule in Washington, consider the pep talk House Republicans received this week from Vice President J.D. Vance.\n\nNormally, conservatives in the House despise \"clean\" funding bills. They dependably refuse to rubber-stamp new spending without concessions aimed at trimming current spending. Some (until this week) had never voted for a \"continuing resolution\" (CR) on principle, because they couldn't bear to carry forward the budgetary status quo even for a few months.\n\nAll of which is to say that politics doesn't typically \"end\" just because one party controls the White House and Congress. Separation of powers compels the president to jockey with his own allies in the House and Senate for control over the direction of policy. Look no further than Donald Trump's first term for an example: The tax cuts that passed in 2017 resembled Paul Ryan's and Mitch McConnell's fantasy legislation a lot more than it did the average blue-collar populist's.\n\nPlenty of Republicans are, were, and will forever be leery of \"clean\" funding bills, and given how narrow the party's majority is in the House, they had the numbers to tank the Trump-approved CR that was offered to them this week. That's what the vice president was up against when he met with the House conference on Tuesday. But he had an ace up his sleeve. Two aces, really.\n\nAccording to reporter Reese Gorman of NOTUS , Vance's message to members on the \"clean\" funding bill was this: \"I want everyone to vote Yes. The President, under Section II, will ensure allocations from Congress are not spent on things that harm the taxpayer.\"\n\nSemafor 's Dave Weigel elaborated . \"The reason the CR dynamics shifted so much-why Rs are now happy to vote for it and Ds don't mind opposing it-is the specter of impoundment,\" he wrote. \"Every Dem previously voted for Ed/USAID etc funding; every Dem watched Trump claw it back. They (predictably) got nowhere trying to Elon-proof new spending and ensure it would go out. Changed their incentives.\"\n\nIf you're having trouble deciphering all of that, let me simplify. Vance told House Republicans that they should go ahead and keep current spending as-is because the president himself will make \"cuts\" by withholding money from recipients whom he, in his wisdom, deems unworthy. That's impoundment , and if left unchecked by the courts it'll effectively gut Congress' power of the purse. After all, if the executive gets to decide which checks written by the legislature get cashed and which don't then it doesn't matter how exorbitantly Congress spends. It could pass a bill authorizing a gazillion dollars in outlays and simply leave it to Trump to choose which outlays should go out the door and which shouldn't.\n\nThat pitch was enough to convince every House Republican except one to support a \"clean\" CR-and every House Democrat except one to oppose it. As Weigel says, why should the out-party support a \"clean\" funding bill that isn't actually clean in practice? As long as Trump is asserting the power to impound funding and nuke disfavored agencies like USAID, a vote for the bill is little more than a vote to give him the final say over how federal money is and isn't spent.\n\nHence Vance's two aces. The first is the fear-and not just electoral fear -that congressional Republicans feel at the thought of defying Trump in a big spot, like a vote to avert a government shutdown during his first 100 days in office. There's no analogue in American history for a president encouraging the degree of cultish devotion among his base that Trump has and weaponizing that devotion against recalcitrant members of his own party to intimidate them into falling in line.\n\nSeparation of powers doesn't work if one branch is afraid to separate from another. When Vance walked into the meeting with House Republicans this week, he knew that everyone there (save Thomas Massie) was desperate for an excuse to vote yes and spare themselves the venom they'd receive for joining with \"the enemy\" to force a shutdown on national savior Donald Trump.\n\nWhat we're experiencing, in other words, is less one-party control of government than one-branch control, far more than even in 2017. With a lone possible exception , intraparty politics in the GOP is effectively over.\n\nWhich brings us to Vance's other ace. In this case, one-branch control means one-person control in practice.\n\nThe vice president's impoundment pitch to House Republicans was more than just a partisan request that they yield to Trump's wishes. It was a request that they cede their branch's constitutional power to him.\n\nIt wasn't even a request. Vance informed the conference that the president intends to withhold some appropriations from whatever bill they might pass and hoped that the prospect of him doing so would suffice to scratch the eternal conservative itch for spending cuts.\n\nI can't imagine a more complete perversion of the Tea Party ethos that launched modern right-wing populism than that. Tea Partiers purported to be constitutional sticklers, obsessed with restraining a \"tyrannical\" president and bent on using Republican legislative leverage to impose discipline on the federal budget. Fifteen years later, their political descendants in Congress are tossing the power of the purse to the White House and encouraging it to do whatever it thinks is best.\n\nThere's a lot in that vein happening in government right now. To a degree none of us have seen, Trump is normalizing consolidation of power in the presidency. There's a simulacrum of politics as usual, like the House going through the motions to pass a \"clean\" funding bill, but beneath the surface, the president is setting all sorts of policy unilaterally.\n\nThat \"new normal\" was the other ace up Vance's sleeve. With Trump calling the shots regarding most other arms of federal authority, why shouldn't House Republicans also trust him to make the spending decisions that Congress traditionally would have made? Politics as we've known it is over. Might as well lean into it.\n\nTake tariffs. There's a simulacrum of politics as usual there insofar as Trump's authority to impose and un-impose (and impose and un-impose...) tariffs is almost certainly legal , gifted to the president by Congress in various statutes over the years that grant executive \"emergency\" power over tariffs. But the helter skelter of the last seven weeks is the opposite of normal politics: Trump is setting trade policy by himself and he's doing it as chaotically as possible, with only the barest pretense of an \"emergency\" to justify it.\n\nThe Republican majorities in Congress could rescind his authority at any time but, for reasons I explained earlier, they don't dare. The president decides now which foreign countries are taxed.\n\nHow about DOGE cuts? The White House plainly enjoys some power to reform federal agencies-politics as usual!-but effectively dismantling them, as Trump and Elon Musk have done in at least one case, is supposed to require buy-in from Congress . The president decides now which departments functionally exist and which don't.\n\nHow about NATO? Under Trump, the United States remains a nominal member of the alliance and can't withdraw from it without Senate approval. Politics as usual! Except that he's switched sides in the Ukraine war , spooked European powers into considering nuclearization , and provided zero reason to believe he'll honor the United States' Article 5 obligations if Russia attacks a NATO member. The president decides now which treaties are followed and which aren't.\n\nHow about Cabinet nominations? Everything there was done by the book, with the Senate confirming all of the president's nominees. Politics as usual! But the pressure tactics Trump used on them were unprecedented, demanding that Senate Republicans recess and forfeit their advice-and-consent power if they couldn't muster the votes to confirm his nominees. That left them with no political cover among the GOP base to reject anyone, with predictable results . And Trump's fondness for dubious \"acting\" appointees during his first term meant that we probably would have ended up with a clown leading the FBI even if Kash Patel had gone down in flames. The president decides now whether his nominees are fit to serve.\n\nEverything important that's happened over the past eight weeks has been superficially \"normal,\" but substantively irregular. Even the basic enforcement of federal criminal laws now depends on whether the president regards the defendant as a friend or enemy . If you don't think politics as we've known it is over, consider the grotesque spectacle of federal lawmakers, who are constitutionally in charge of spending , begging Elon Musk not to cut expenditures that might affect jobs in their district.\n\nIt's the end of politics. Democrats don't know what to do.\n\nThat, I take it, is why support for a shutdown keeps trickling in even from swing-state Senate Dems . This is the first opportunity they've had during Trump's presidency to exert any control whatsoever over our national freak show, and they might not have another until fall.\n\nAmerican politics has ended, at least temporarily. The out-party has to do something to try to reverse that, no? Even if that something risks making it toxic to swing voters.\n\nOne can make a case that no political party since the start of the Reagan Revolution has been as powerless as Democrats are right now. The only comparison is the bloody heap Republicans were left in after the Democratic sweep in 2008 that briefly gave liberals a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. But for all the right-wing panic at the time about Barack Obama changing the \"nature\" of America, his neoliberal project was far less revolutionary in its ambitions than the postliberal project on which Trump and his devotees have embarked.\n\nRepublicans in 2009 had to worry about Democrats ramming through a bunch of expensive statist policies. Democrats in 2025 have to worry about Republicans rebalancing the constitutional order so heavily in favor of autocracy that the left will struggle to restrain Trump even if it regains a degree of federal power in 2026. The end of politics isn't a byproduct of postliberalism, it's the point. It's the essence of \" knowing what time it is .\"\n\nIf Democrats shut the government down, that'll be why. They've been rendered powerless, it's uncertain if-not even when-that will change, so they're going to exert what little power they have and let the chips fall where they may.\n\nAs a strategic matter, I find the plan dubious. But as a psychological matter, it's understandable. Remember, Democrats are also in the middle of a hellacious identity crisis triggered by November's catastrophe, one that gets weirder by the hour . And their anxiety about having no control over events is compounded by the fact that, increasingly, it feels like no one in the ruling party has control over events either . There's a measles outbreak happening in America right now and this absolute lunatic is technically in charge of the federal response. If you had one chance to impose a degree of order on chaos as sinister as that, even if it were a longshot that required a shutdown, wouldn't you yearn to take it?\n\nWe end with an easy prediction: If Democrats end up regaining the House majority in 2026, two years of frustration at being powerless to stop a cadre of proto-fascist crackpots from wrecking the government will manifest in a degree of bitter congressional obstructionism unlike anything we've ever seen.\n\nThe out-party is always bitter when it returns to power after being shut out for a while, but a Democratic House confronting Trump in 2027 will be a different kind of beast. After watching the president run roughshod over limits on his power for two years with the full acquiescence of his party, the mandate for House Democrats will be simple and stark: Stop him at all costs. Stop the autocracy, stop the DOGE rampage, stop the bullying of American allies, stop the corruption and self-enrichment , stop the anti-vax witch-doctoring, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.\n\nHakeem Jeffries had better eat his Wheaties. But until then, shutdown theater is all he and his party have to interrupt the end of politics.\n\nNick Catoggio is a staff writer at The Dispatch and is based in Texas.

      "text": "Looming Funding Deadline Squeezes Senate Democrats\n\nWill Democrats vote for a CR they oppose or risk taking the blame for a shutdown?\n\nAudio versions are only available to subscribers of The Dispatch. Join Today ! to listen to this post.\n\nAfter Speaker of the House Mike Johnson succeeded in pushing a stopgap spending measure through his chamber Tuesday, Senate Democrats are in a bind. Their dual goals-avoiding a government shutdown and slowing Elon Musk's slashing path through federal agencies-seem to be in opposition.\n\nCongress must pass a continuing resolution (CR) by 11:59 p.m. on Friday, or else the government's approved funding will run out, forcing most federal agency functions to shut down. On Tuesday, the House passed its bill to fund the federal government through September basically along party lines, but 60 votes are necessary to pass the bill through the Senate. Sen. Rand Paul already has vowed to break with his party and vote down the CR, meaning that Republicans will need at least eight Democrats to join them to overcome the filibuster and send the spending bill to President Donald Trump's desk. Republicans have already made it clear they are ready to blame Democrats if a government shutdown occurs.\n\n\"I think the American people are going to be interested to see whether Democrats are going to filibuster, and by filibustering, shut down the federal government,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune said at a press conference Tuesday. \"It is on them when this happens.\"\n\nAs of Wednesday evening, no vote had yet been scheduled in the Senate. That day, the Senate's Democratic leadership floated the idea of forcing Congress to take up a short-term CR they have proposed to fund the government through April 11 while negotiators finish up a comprehensive appropriations agreement. But such a short-term CR is not the bill the House passed, and its members declared recess and left town after passing their measure.\n\nNegotiations between the two parties in the House and Senate Appropriations Committees broke down weeks ago, leading to the need for a stop-gap funding measure to keep the government open, something neither side wanted . Democrats' main ask was for language in the measure to ensure that Trump spends money in the way Congress appropriated it, but Republicans argued it was an infringement on the separation of powers. \"They were demanding that we put a provision-not just in an appropriations bill, but in the CR-handcuffing the ability of the executive branch to reduce spending,\" Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana, who sits on the Appropriations Committee, told The Dispatch . \"Now they proposed that because President Trump is the president, and they don't like President Trump. If they thought there was any reasonable possibility that we would do that, they must have been day drinking. We wouldn't do that even when a Democratic president, President Biden, was president.\"\n\nEssentially, the choice facing Senate Democrats is to either vote for a Republican CR they strongly oppose or bear the blame for shutting down the government. As they weigh their options, they need to consider several factors.\n\nThe first is the political ramifications of a shutdown. Democrats would be gambling that the American people will blame Republicans rather than them in the event that Congress cannot meet the Friday deadline.\n\n\"Republicans are in charge of the House, the Senate, and the White House, guys. I don't know what else to tell you,\" Sen. Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico told reporters.\n\nAny blame assessed by voters will be reflected in the results of the 2026 midterm elections, but there are also shorter-term considerations for Democrats. The House's CR does not have the key guarantee they sought: to curtail Trump's discretion over the spending that Congress appropriates. \"The CR actually gives him the ability to spend funds without any congressional oversight,\" Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, told The Dispatch .\n\nIf they fold now and vote for such a CR, Democrats could lose their leverage on the issue. Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia acknowledged that concern among Democrats. \"I do know that that is something that Sen. Murray, as the lead Dem, is very mindful of, and exactly what mechanisms you put in place that are guardrails against that I don't exactly know, but it is an issue that we've talked about at some length, and I know Patty is very focused on it,\" he said.\n\nBut the other option-shutting down non-essential government functions for the first time since 2018-does not guarantee that they will be able to rein in the executive branch. As billionaire Elon Musk attempts to remake federal agencies as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, some Democrats foresee a shutdown as only helping his efforts.\n\n\"The CR may enable more firing, but closing the government may be even more welcome to Elon Musk because it gives him an excuse to fire more people, and he can blame it on the Democrats,\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut told reporters.\n\nSen. Ron Wyden of Oregon made similar comments.\n\n\"I think it would be immensely damaging,\" he said of a shutdown. \"When I came out, people asked me what I thought, and, as of right now, I think the Musk brigade is doing an enormous amount of damage to essential services like veterans and kids and the like, and I am not going to be part of helping them in it.\"\n\nHowever, he would not say which outcome helps Musk's team more, nor how he would vote.\n\nWith just two days to decide on a course of action, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is saying his caucus will continue to push for the short-term CR, and other Democrats have said they will try to muscle Republicans into agreeing to a vote on an amendment that would shorten the term of the current bill. Otherwise, Democrats have generally been coy about what they would do if the GOP puts the House CR up for a vote. There are a few \"no's,\" but most are not saying definitively how they would vote .\n\nOne Democrat has been vocally opposed to a shutdown at all costs. Before House Republicans even unveiled their CR, Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania tweeted last week that he would \"never vote to shut our government down.\" Asked about the ramifications of that decision, Fetterman stuck to that promise.\n\n\"You don't have to take me out for dinner here. Cut to the chase. Are you saying I'm going to vote to shut the government down?\" he told The Dispatch . \"I've been very clear I will not vote or withhold my vote to shut the government down.\"\n\nCharles Hilu is a reporter for The Dispatch based in Virginia.

      "text": "Democrats Could Learn Something From the Rise of the Whigs\n\nThe party opposing Jacksonian populism found electoral success by broadening its coalition.\n\nWhen Andrew Jackson won the 1828 presidential election, his victory also set into motion a political shift that would result in a party built to oppose a demagogue: the Whigs. In the wake of Donald Trump's return to power, today's Democrats would do well to study the Whigs' rise, with both their successes and stumbles.\n\nThe parallel is inexact, as historical analogues always are. Jackson's victory was more emphatic, with him winning 68 percent of the Electoral College vote compared to Trump's 58 percent and more than 55 percent of the popular vote compared to Trump's roughly 50 percent. The 1828 election was early in the history of our republic, when political parties were more in flux than they are now.\n\nBut Trump likes to compare himself to Jackson, a fellow celebrity who led a revolt against the establishment of the time, and the comparison is more compelling now than it was when Trump won in 2016. This is due not only to the fact that Trump won the popular vote this time, but also to how he got there. Like Trump in 2020, Jackson reacted poorly to defeat. He thought himself rightfully elected in 1824 and denounced his exclusion from office as a \"corrupt bargain\" between his rivals (he received the highest vote share, but none of the four candidates received a majority of the Electoral College vote and the winner was decided by the House). His 1828 campaign was imbued with a desire to avenge that perceived wrong-\"retribution,\" you might say. Two of his salient policies were similar to Trump's: a purge of the civil service (\" to the victor belongs the spoils \") and mass deportations (of the Five Tribes ).\n\nIn both cases, the vengeful demagogue kicked aside opponents whose appeal had become too limited to prevail nationally. Today it was the Democrats (who, ironically, trace their origin to Jackson). In 1828, it was a faction led by incumbent President John Quincy Adams and Secretary of State Henry Clay that later became known as the National Republicans. Both election campaigns had been bitter and personal . The defeated parties feared, not without reason, that their victorious rivals would attempt to govern as autocrats.\n\nYet politics continued , and the National Republicans had to figure out how to mount an opposition capable of reclaiming a majority from the surging populists after their 1828 defeat. They flunked their first attempt when Clay ran against Jackson in 1832. The National Republicans largely stuck to the policy mix and rhetoric they were habituated to in the hope that Jackson's 1828 success had been an aberration, and the result was that Clay lost by an even larger margin than Adams had.\n\nJackson's opponents tried a different approach after 1832: expanding their electoral coalition by loosening their ideological bounds. The National Republicans' desire for an expansive federal government role had largely confined their appeal to New England and the smaller mid-Atlantic states. To compete in the South and Midwest, as well as in Pennsylvania and New York, they had to make room in their party for states' rights proponents and Anti-Masonic populists without alienating too much of their existing base of northeastern merchants and professionals.\n\nThe Whig Party, organized in 1834 by cobbling together various factions, was therefore an odd bunch. Some of its members, such as Clay, had been lifelong Democratic-Republicans, the party founded by Thomas Jefferson that Jackson's rise had split. Some, like Adams and Massachusetts Sen. Daniel Webster, had ties to the defunct Federalist Party of Alexander Hamilton. Others , like New York Rep. Millard Fillmore, were Anti-Masons who disliked that Jackson was a Freemason, but could overlook the fact that Clay was one too. Others still, such as North Carolina Sen. Willie Mangum, were Jacksonian defectors who responded to the Whig founders' outreach to Southerners.\n\nThese factions generally supported infrastructure projects, pro-banking policies and government intervention to support economic recovery in downturns. But they differed widely on slavery and to a greater or lesser degree on a host of other issues: tariffs, temperance, the re-chartering of the Bank of the United States, and the respective roles of the federal and state governments, to name but a few. When they agreed on things, they often did so for different reasons, and it took time for them to cohere, as Michael F. Holt traced step by step in his 1999 book The Rise and Fall of the American Whig Party .\n\nWhat the Whigs had from the beginning, however, was a unifying purpose: opposing the populism of Jackson and the drift toward autocracy they believed it exhibited. Their unusual name came from the British (who have a penchant for unusual names ). The British Whigs generally aimed to limit the powers of the monarch, and they led the opposition to King George III during the American Revolution. The American Whigs meant to oppose the man they styled \" King Andrew \" and his movement, and to keep them within the bounds of the Constitution. Differences in opinion on other matters could be tolerated.\n\nGradually, this expansion strategy paid off. The Whigs gained seats in Congress in 1836, 1838, and 1840. They failed to defeat Jackson's anointed successor, Martin Van Buren, in the 1836 presidential election, possibly because they employed the unconventional strategy of fielding several candidates . But they won in a near landslide in 1840 after Van Buren was left holding the bag during the financial panics of 1837 and 1839, crises that were likely exacerbated by Jackson's populist dismantling of the aforementioned national bank.\n\nThe Whigs were well-positioned to exploit the Jacksonians' stumbles because they both offered a contrast and had a political base large enough to mount an effective challenge when the opportunity arose. Whig candidates could stoop to populist gestures, such as William Henry Harrison's \"log cabin and hard cider\" campaign theme , but the business-friendly Whigs were not a populist party. They tended to appeal more to the better-off, but they crossed geographic and ideological lines: Their base encompassed East Coast industrialists and Midwestern shopkeepers, Northern abolitionists and Southern slaveholders. The Jacksonians attempted to attack the Whigs as out-of-touch aristocrats, as they had done successfully against the National Republicans, but the potency of that accusation faded as the Whig coalition broadened.\n\nDemocrats today can-and should-learn from the mistakes of the National Republicans and the early successes of the Whigs. That's not to say they should want to be the Whigs, who proved to be a fractious and short-lived party that was plagued by bad luck (both of its elected presidents died not long after assuming office) and made several missteps once in power. Nor is it to say with certainty that the Democrats are doomed unless they make major changes to their political disposition. But there are warning signs from the election, in which once-solid parts of the Democratic coalition shifted toward Trump. Democrats should take seriously the possibility that their 2024 defeat could be a prelude to a harsher beating in 2028 if they do not expand their tent in the way the Whig founders did.\n\nThe good news is that the victory margins for Trump and congressional Republicans were relatively small, and Trump is ineligible to run again. The Democrats should be able to reclaim the majority much more quickly than Jackson's opponents if they take even a few steps toward broadening their coalition.\n\nOf the many steps they could take, dropping \"woke\" rhetoric about race and gender is probably the necessary first one. Allowing some internal dissension on abortion could counter Trump's expansion of the Republican tent on that issue and bring more religious voters into the Democratic coalition. An economic pragmatism that promotes ethical competition and eschews fixation on price gouging could woo small and medium business owners and position Democrats for a scenario in which Tariff Man trashes his and the Republicans' reputation for economic competence.\n\nThose are far from the only options. Party leaders and Democratic voters will have to sort out which new ideas and allies are palatable to them. Perhaps they decide they can play ball with neoconservatives , but libertarians are a bridge too far. So be it.\n\nWhat is necessary is that Democrats offer their would-be fellow partisans more than a \" place for you in our campaign \" and stump appearances with conservatives like Liz Cheney. They would need to make concessions in their platform and allow Democratic candidates in different states and counties to hold positions that many in the party now might feel uncomfortable with, and do so without simultaneously condemning them for their positions. The politics of addition is necessarily an uncomfortable and somewhat incoherent business.\n\nWhat could a Whiggish Democratic Party unite around? Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy's recent suggestion of \"power de-concentration\" could be a rallying cry if focused not just economically, as he intended, but politically with the aim of restraining the executive branch. Democrats could run in the 2026 midterms on a platform of reclaiming for Congress some of the many powers it has delegated to the president over decades. Such a pitch may have broad appeal if Trump spends his first two years back in office indulging his worst impulses. A big-tent Democratic Party might also rediscover the virtues of federalism and push for decentralization of some decision-making to the states and to local governments within states.\n\nThese stances could be political winners; they would also be good for the long-term preservation of the republic. In that way, they would hearken back to the best ideals of the American and British Whigs . When faced with an overreaching monarch or a demagogue who gives every indication of wanting to rule in monarchical style, it is healthy to have an anti-monarchical party. For all its faults, the Whig Party blunted the Jacksonian revolution. It also provided a political home for a young lawyer named Abraham Lincoln. There are far worse examples to emulate.\n\nJohn P.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy\n\nFormer Republican presidential candidate Larry Elder fires back at Democrats for downplaying attacks against Teslas on 'The Evening Edit.'\n\nDemocratic lawmakers spent years pushing the auto industry into the electric vehicle sector but are now critical of President Donald Trump for promoting Tesla and embracing its founder, Elon Musk.\n\nDemocrats have been at the forefront of the green energy movement, championing former President Joe Biden's mandates to require more electric vehicle purchases, implementing strict emissions standards in their own states and delivering party-wide support for the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, the landmark climate bill that implemented a tax credit of up to $7,000 for EV purchases, including Tesla models.\n\nHowever, the same lawmakers that spent years promoting more electric vehicle sales have grown critical of America's largest electric vehicle manufacturer, Tesla, amid owner Elon Musk's affiliation with the Trump administration.\n\nTrump recently bought a red Tesla Model S as \"a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk, a truly great American.\" The president showcased his new electric vehicle at the White House, similar to when Biden, in 2021, drove a Jeep Wrangler Hybrid on the White House South Lawn in accordance with his executive order to require half of new car and truck sales be electric by 2030.\n\nELON MUSK REASSURES TESLA WORKERS WITH ALL-HANDS MEETING, ADMITS IT 'FEELS LIKE ARMAGEDDON'\n\nBut Trump's Tesla purchase prompted backlash from Democratic lawmakers who accused him of not being focused on other issues.\n\nPresident Donald Trump gets out of a Tesla Model S vehicle on the South Lawn of the White House on March 11, 2025. (Samuel Corum/Sipa/Bloomberg / Getty Images)\n\n\"Grocery prices are soaring. Housing costs are skyrocketing. Retirement savings are plummeting. But Donald Trump thought today would be a good day to play car salesman,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said in a post on X.\n\nHowever, the senator has previously supported the push for electric vehicles. For example, on her campaign website, Warren recalls being a \"proud\" original cosponsor of the Green New Deal resolution, which \"commits the United States to a ten-year mobilization to achieve domestic net-zero emissions by 2030.\"\n\nAnother Democrat, Rep. Katherine Clark, D-Mass., also railed against Trump's promotion of Tesla despite previously voting to provide tax credits for Tesla purchases through the passing of the IRA.\n\n\"While Republicans were voting to take health care away from families and veterans, Donald Trump hosted a Tesla car show at the White House for his biggest donor,\" Clark said in a post on X. \"Peak corruption.\"\n\nClark has previously championed investments in green energy vehicles and charging stations, praising Biden for signing an infrastructure law which granted the congresswoman's state of Massachusetts $22.9 million to \"build out a network of electric vehicle charging stations,\" according to a 2022 press release.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers are critical of Trump for promoting and embracing Tesla founder Elon Musk. (Getty Images / Getty Images)\n\nMUSK, WHITE HOUSE DISS WALZ'S 2024 ELECTION LOSS AFTER DEM GOV TAKES AIM AT TESLA STOCK\n\nFormer Democratic vice presidential candidate Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., recently said that he checks Tesla stock to get a daily \"boost,\" poking fun at the business after its stock was down 41.4% year-to-date as of March.\n\n\"On the iPhone, they've got that little stock app. I added Tesla to it to give me a little boost during the day,\" Walz said during an event titled \"The People vs Musk\" on Tuesday, where he encouraged Tesla owners to remove the logo on their car with \"dental floss.\"\n\nWalz's joke about the electric vehicle business stock dropping comes after the governor signed an executive order in 2021 to match California's strict emissions standards and require more EV sales in Minnesota.\n\nMinnesota Gov.

Mark Kelly, R-Ariz., has championed EVs in Arizona, but he recently said he was getting rid of his Tesla for a gas-guzzler SUV over his opposition to Elon Musk's cost-cutting efforts at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\n\"I bought a Tesla because it was fast like a rocket ship. But now every time I drive it, I feel like a rolling billboard for a man dismantling our government and hurting people. So Tesla, you're fired!\" Kelly wrote in a post on X in March. \"New ride coming soon.\"\n\nKelly, who in 2023 praised a bipartisan infrastructure law that gave $27 million for \"a new fleet of electric vehicles,\" turned in his electric vehicle for a gas-powered Chevy Tahoe SUV.\n\nTesla has fallen victim to a string of crimes from anti-Elon Musk protesters who have set fire to, spit on, and keyed the company's cars across the country.\n\n\"Democrats were big supporters of Tesla and of electric vehicles until Elon Musk decided to vote for Donald Trump. So we would like Democrats to also come out and condemn this heinous violence that we have seen,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a press briefing on Wednesday. \"And I believe the attorney general has said she's investigating these incidents as acts of domestic terrorism.\"\n\nFive Tesla vehicles were set on fire and shot at in what police are investigating as a \"targeted attack\" at a repair center in Las Vegas on March 18, 2025. (Hal Sparks via Storyful / Storyful)\n\nSteve Milloy, senior fellow at the Energy and Environment Legal Institute and former Trump EPA transition team member, detailed the negative impact such fires have on the environment.\n\n\"During an EV fire, more than 100 substances are emitted, including heavy metals, carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide, all of which can cause illness and death at high enough exposures. Research is underway to understand what if any actual risks to firefighters, the general public and the environment are posed by EV fires,\" Milloy said.\n\n\"Keeping in mind that it is the dose that makes the poison, it will likely be difficult to assess such risks, especially as the pollutants are dispersed and diluted through the air,\" Milloy told Fox News Digital. \"But given that greens have pushed for laws that fine people for the act of mere littering, it would be inconceivably hypocritical for them not to condemn and support prosecution for the attacks on Teslas.\"\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Warren, Walz and Clark for comment.\n\nGet a brief on the top business stories of the week, plus CEO interviews, market updates, tech and money news that matters to you.\n\nWe've added you to our mailing list.\n\nBy clicking subscribe, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

But there's one catch: they are two white men who don't fit the identity politics of the party's base and hold widely progressive views that clash with Middle America.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee's election this past weekend of Minnesotan Ken Martin to be chairman and anti-gun activist David Hogg have mystified political observers on both sides of the aisle after an election in which voters clearly rejected the far-left drift of the party.\n\n\"Democrats have once again fallen victim to identity politics, and it's going to be very hard for Democrats to walk away from identity politics,\" Rep. Nick Begich, R-Alaska, who ousted a Democrat incumbent in November, told Just the News.\n\n\"They've essentially evangelized their base to the point where the base has religion around identity and that base is not going to be satisfied unless their leadership continues down that line of thinking,\" he added.\n\nMany Democrats agree, including Faiz Shakir, former manager of Bernie Sanders 2020 presidential campaign.\n\n\"I'm frustrated by the way in which we utilize identity to break ourselves apart,\" he told the crowd. \"Listen, I worked at the ACLU. I'm supportive of diversity, equity and all the rest. But we're competing over the wrong thing when we should be joining together to fight together.\"\n\nAfter the election, Shakir continued to be frustrated that new leadership hadn't solved a core problem. \"I think the Democratic brand is hurting because people feel that you cannot, with conviction and integrity, tell me what you honestly feel about some hard issues,\" he told an interviewer .\n\nThe obsession with far-left values has also led Democrats to explain away their stinging election losses with an excuse most voters don't share. MSNBC's Jonathan Capehart asked the eight candidates on stage during the DNC election, \"So, I'm going to have a show of hands. How many of you believe that racism and misogyny played a role in Vice President Harris' defeat?\"\n\nEvery single candidate raised their hand, including Martin and Hogg.\n\nSoon after, the DNC voted two white men to be its next leaders, rejecting more diverse candidates that included a black woman, two white women and a Muslim man. For many it was a display of hypocrisy for a party whose DEI mantra demanded racial and gender equity in education, government and business over the past several years.\n\n\"You can tell a lot about somebody based not on what they say, but what they do. And the Democrat Party, you know, they have a lot of rhetoric around DEI,\" Begich said.\n\nPolling shows the Democrat focus on DEI comes with a blowback. A recent Napolitan News survey found that 63% of Americans oppose the government doing business with companies that hold the basic tenet of DEI: that America is fundamentally racist and sexist.\n\n\"DEI was never popular with the public. It had - and still has - a strong following among progressives,\" pollster Scott Rasmussen said. \"They pushed it into government and corporate America below the radar. Once it became visible, the backlash was inevitable.\"\n\nWhat Americans are most concerned about - and hold great hope Donald Trump will fix - are the issues that most impact their pocketbooks and families.\n\nCredit card debt has skyrocketed to an historic $1 trillion collectively by spring 2024. Hardship withdrawals from retirement accounts exploded 30% with the most common reason cited being avoiding evictions or foreclosure and unpaid medical bills. In the months following the end of COVID lockdowns and mandates, the lower income 80% of Americans (outside of the wealthiest 20%) had less cash than before the pandemic.\n\nThe liberal effort to force transgenderism on students also has boomeranged, with even staunch liberals like Bill Maher rejecting it and wondering why it is only a phenomenon in blue states.\n\n\"If this spike in trans children is all biological, why is it regional? Either Ohio is shaming them or California is creating them,\" he quipped recently.\n\nWhile Democrats lean into issues that polls show cost them the election, Trump is plowing ahead in reversing the Biden agenda and with majority support. His 53% approval rating is 10 points higher than the beginning of his first term.\n\nWhile entrenched in DEI priorities, this is the first time in 14 years that the DNC will not be run by a female or a person of color. To his credit, Martin claims to understand that those priorities must be in the wake. He told The New York Times that \"for the first time in modern history, the majority of Americans believe that the Republican Party best represents the interests of the working class and the poor, and that the Democratic Party represents the interest of the wealthy an the elite.\"\n\nIf that sentiment remains and subsequent efforts to reverse course are successful, Democrats can possibly reverse the dynamic that caused Kamala Harris to lose out to Donald Trump with working class Americans. Common sense policies and reaching working class Americans are how you win elections."

Forty-eight percent of Americans surveyed had a favorable opinion of President Donald Trump and former President Bill Clinton, though more people were unfavorable toward Trump (12% answered as having 'no opinion' on Clinton).\n\nThe data from the latest Gallup survey coincides with data from another poll the analytics firm released in January showing \"that partisans have grown more ideologically polarized in the past few years.\" That poll reflected all-time highs in the number of Republicans and Democrats identifying as conservative and liberal. Seventy-seven percent of Republicans identified as conservative in the January poll, with 24% saying they were very conservative, while 55% of Democrats identified as liberal and 19% as very liberal. Each of these were record highs, with the percentage of those describing themselves as conservative growing by four points from 2023."

Though it would keep most funding at current levels, it increased defense spending by $6 billion, added the same sum for veterans' health care, gave $10 billion to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and marginally lowered non-defense spending.\n\nTo become law, the bill will need to clear the Senate's 60-vote filibuster threshold, meaning at least seven Democrats will need to support the plan if all Republicans favor it. But. Sen. Rand Paul , R-Ky., is a hard \"no,\" putting the threshold for passage at eight Democrats. That's where the blame game comes in. Typically, Republicans have been wary of causing a shutdown due to fears of the public blaming them.\n\nSome polling data has suggested that Republicans' fears of being blamed for a shutdown are well-founded. Fifty-five percent of registered voters expressed support for the proposal, including 79% of Republicans, a Napolitan News Survey conducted Monday revealed. Just 29% opposed the plan while 17% were unsure.\n\nPrior to the Tuesday vote, Vice President JD Vance was on Capitol Hill to whip Republican votes after Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., announced his opposition to the plan.\n\n\"We already lost one vote, we can't lose another,\" Vance told House Republicans , according to Politico . He further warned lawmakers that the GOP would likely face the blame for a shutdown and lose support from voters on other issues.\n\nTrump, for his part, sent a clear message to lawmakers with his support for a primary challenge to Massie over his opposition to the continuing resolution. Massie has previously survived a MAGA-aligned, Trump-backed primary challenge, though other lawmakers may not be so successful at defying the president.\n\n\"Congressman Thomas Massie, of beautiful Kentucky, is an automatic \"NO\" vote on just about everything, despite the fact that he has always voted for Continuing Resolutions in the past. HE SHOULD BE PRIMARIED, and I will lead the charge against him. He's just another GRANDSTANDER, who's too much trouble, and not worth the fight. He reminds me of Liz Cheney before her historic, record breaking fall (loss!). The people of Kentucky won't stand for it, just watch,\" Trump posted on Truth Social.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, for his part, went on the offensive ahead of the vote, hoping to pin the blame for a shutdown on the Democrats by highlighting prior statements opposing such a move from the party's prominent lawmakers.\n\n\"Democrats have railed against government shutdowns. But now they're supporting one. What's changed? They're willing to do ANYTHING to stop President Trump from implementing his agenda,\" Johnson posted , along with a video of Democrats expressing their opposition to a shutdown. Featured in the video were former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and others.\n\n\"We believe in government, we want to keep government open. A shutdown is very serious,\" Pelosi said in the clip.\n\nJohnson further turned up the heat by pointing to the opposition party's low approval ratings, saying \"If our Democratic colleagues want to increase their 21% approval rating with the American public, they ought to start by doing the right thing by keeping the government open.\" He made the remarks during a March 3 weekly GOP press conference.\n\nSome Democrats have expressed concerns that Trump's creation of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) changed the calculus of a government shutdown to a considerable degree. Namely, as Elon Musk moves to drastically downsize waste and abuse in the federal government, a lack of funding from Congress could help him eliminate much more of the bureaucracy than a downsized funding package would.\n\nMusk \"is shutting down parts of the government already,\" Sen. Mark Kelly , R-Ariz., said, according to The Hill . \"Who knows what he's going to want to open back up? ... That is a huge risk.  Maybe they decide that entire government agencies don't need to exist anymore.\" \"The Republicans are already shutting down government. We need a short-term CR so that we can get our funding,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., told the same publication.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether such anxieties will prove sufficient to get the spending package over the line. Should they fail, a shutdown will take effect at 12:00 a.m. on Saturday."

We must fight back for a better way. Listen to the women, For The People.\"\n\nThe comment comes as other Democrats urge Schumer to step down as minority leader over his willingness to advance the bill. Schumer said that he does not support the bill, but that a federal government shutdown would be worse.\n\nThe Senate is set to vote on advancing the legislation on Friday afternoon.

Last month, Trump ordered a freeze on federal funding going toward \"financial assistance for foreign aid, nongovernmental organizations, DEI, woke gender ideology, and the green new deal.\"\n\nDemocrats in the Senate introduced legislation this week to terminate Trump's energy emergency, arguing that only oil companies will benefit from it, and a coalition of renewable energy groups and companies are initiating a lobbying blitz to protect the subsidies they say their low-cost industries need to survive.\n\nDuring Wednesday's hearing, Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Fla., said that nothing in the executive orders Trump signed upon taking office would lower energy costs or help \"hard-working Americans.\"\n\n\"Instead, across the board, the actions are a gift to big oil companies. They're designed to boost their profits at the expense of working families across the country,\" Castor said.\n\nShe said the country has an opportunity to build on the \"successes\" of the Biden-Harris administration's energy policies that have been advancing \"lower-cost, clean-energy grid resilience, innovation and efficiency.\"\n\nHowever, this lower cost grid powered by renewables, she said, requires ongoing taxpayer support, including the trillions of dollars from Biden's signature Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nCastor criticized the president for declaring an energy emergency when the U.S. was producing more oil and gas than any country in history and leading the world in nuclear and renewable energy. She said his freeze on funding was hurting renewable energy projects, the transmission construction they need, and jobs in the industry.\n\n\"Frankly, when you look at what's going on, it's illegal, and we're not going to stand for it. We're going to fight back to make sure that these dollars get to where they're supposed to go and build the clean energy economy that is important to all of us,\" Castor said.\n\nRep. John James, R-Mich., disputed the claims that the Biden-Harris administration's energy policy was lowering costs for Americans.\n\n\"Apparently Democrat gaslighting produces zero emissions. But what does their radical agenda mean for constituents in my districts and your districts who pay more for pump, who pay more for groceries, folks in Southeast Michigan have experienced their jobs being extinct [and] being shipped to other states, being shipped to other countries? Because Green New Deal, woke policies do not work in the real world,\" James said.\n\nThe Republicans on the committee generally agreed with an \"all of the above\" approach to energy, but they argued that natural gas and nuclear would be needed to ensure grid reliability and affordability.\n\n\"Intermittent energy sources such as solar and wind have a role to play in a diverse energy mix. However, we must maintain our base load power that is delivered from fossil fuels, nuclear and hydro power,\" said Rep. Bob Latta, R-Ohio.\n\nRep. Brett Guthrie, R-Ky., talked about the increasing demands for energy and how the changing nature of the U.S. electricity generation mix was struggling to keep up.\n\n\"We all have seen the increasing strains on our electric grid, including failure to provide reliable power utilizing coal, natural gas and nuclear when it is needed. Most grid and energy experts warn the frequency of these outages will only increase if state and federal renewable energy policies continue to drive their premature retirement of traditional base load generation,\" Guthrie said.\n\nBrigham McCown, senior fellow with the Hudson Institute, pointed to Europe's experience with a green energy transition, which has gone much further than America's policies. Europe's economy is now struggling with crushing energy costs, and its industries are shutting down .\n\n\"The retirement of nuclear plants and the removal of cheap Russian fossil fuels has been devastating. I'd like to point out, too, that their carbon emissions, if you're keeping score, have gone up, not down, despite all these investments. It is not the way to do things,\" McCown said.\n\nMcCown compared an \"all of the above\" energy strategy that doesn't include plenty of fossil fuels and nuclear power to a carpenter who uses only a hammer and no other tools.\n\n\"This energy mix is going to change over time, but we have to lead with what is reliable, efficient and affordable. Because otherwise we can bankrupt ourselves and be in a position like Europe, where they have none of the above,\" McCown said.\n\nDemocrats in Congress are gearing up to fight Trump's \"American energy dominance\" executive orders, which they say will only benefit \"big oil.\" Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., and Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., drafted legislation that will terminate Trump's declaration of a national energy emergency.\n\n\"While Donald Trump focuses on repaying the corporate polluter executives who donated to his campaign, it is the American people who will pay the price of his sham 'energy emergency.' His autocratic and unlawful attacks on clean energy investments will kill American jobs, raise costs on families, weaken our economic competitiveness, and erode American global energy dominance,\" Heinrich said in a statement .\n\nPower the Future , an energy advocacy group, criticized Heinrich and Kaine for introducing the legislation when recent reports show inflation continues to be a problem .\n\n\"The truth is they are simple partisans who didn't think it was an emergency when Americans were paying record gas prices and Joe Biden was begging Saudi Arabia for more oil. Make no mistake: These two Senators were key votes for the failed Inflation Reduction Act so when it comes to knowing which laws will help working families, these two should sit it out,\" Daniel Turner, executive director of Power the Future, said in a statement.\n\nOn Thursday, a broad coalition of renewable energy groups and companies initiated a \"lobbying blitz,\" which includes a letter writing campaign and 100 meetings with members of Congress and staff from both parties.\n\n\"Solar can be built faster and cheaper than almost any technology, and it's clear that we can't meet our nation's energy challenges or President Trump's energy vision without a robust American solar and storage industry,\" Abigail Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), said in a statement announcing the blitz.\n\nAccording to the statement, this cheap form of energy won't be able to grow without federal energy tax credits. Absent taxpayer support, clean energy deployment would fall by 237 gigawatts over the next 15 years, according to Aurora Energy Research .\n\nWith 24/7 backup from coal, natural gas, nuclear or hydroelectric, 237 gigawatts of solar power delivered for a month could help power nearly 8 million homes.\n\nA Democratic reaction to Trump's agenda, which has radically reshaped energy policy in a very short period of time, was expected. And their actions this week are unlikely to be the last."

      "text": "In the Democrats' looming civil war, one side is already doomed\n\nIn the last few days we've heard what sound like the opening salvos of a Democratic Party civil war.\n\nAfter losing two of the last three presidential elections to Donald Trump, self-reflection is sorely needed - and some are at least feigning an interest in such an effort.\n\nOn his new podcast, California Gov. Gavin Newsom is sniping at the progressive shibboleths he once promulgated so proudly.\n\nIn the Senate, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer rejected calls from his left flank to shut down the federal government rather than let a Republican-backed funding bill pass.\n\nAnd across the country, swing-state lawmakers like Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin are trying to tell constituents that the hysterical far-left approach to fighting Trump just hasn't worked.\n\n\"What have they actually done ?\" Slotkin asked last week after a voter implored her to  \"resist\" like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nMeanwhile, Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez are crisscrossing the country to expound a very different explanation of the Democrats' woes - and to promote a very different corrective.\n\nSanders had harsh words for the Democrats this month, calling the party \"heavily dominated by the billionaire class, run by consultants who are way out of touch with reality.\"\n\n\"The Democratic Party has virtually no grassroots support,\" he declared.\n\nAOC, too, slammed her party at a Las Vegas rally last week.\n\n\"We need a Democratic Party that fights harder for us,\" she complained.\n\n\"We as a community must choose and vote for Democrats and elected officials who know how to stand for the working class.\"\n\nSo which is it?\n\nDo Democrats need to lurch even further to the left in the name of \"fighting Trump\" - or is that what's consigned them to their unenviable position?\n\nAvailable evidence suggests it's the latter.\n\nPolls ahead of November's presidential election found that 47% of likely voters believed 2024 Democratic nominee Kamala Harris was \"too liberal or progressive,\" while just 6% said she wasn't \"liberal or progressive enough.\"\n\nThat hasn't changed in the months since: A new survey released by Echelon Insights this month revealed that 42% of Democrats think the party should move \"to the center\" - and only 20% want it to move \"to the left.\"\n\nBut just because the answer is obvious doesn't mean party leaders will recognize as much.\n\nIn fact, they're all but certain to do the opposite.\n\nToday's Democratic Party is built on the proposition that it stands on the right side of history, pushing humanity toward progress while battling backward, bigoted opponents.\n\nFor a long time, that messaging has served as a powerful recruitment tool, particularly for younger, idealistic Americans searching for meaning - and for an easier path into elite progressive-dominated political, media and academic circles.\n\nBut now we see the drawbacks to this smug self-conception.\n\nOver the long term, it has spawned a radicalization that first offended the sensibilities of the median voter, then pushed them into the arms of a pugilistic champion: Trump.\n\nWorse yet, the nature of the Democrats' messaging makes it nearly impossible for them to walk back any of their unpopular ideas.\n\nThey were on the right side of history, they declared, when they manufactured a crisis at the southern border.\n\nThey were on the right side of history when they insisted that not only could men become women, such men must be allowed to compete in women's sports and enter their most intimate spaces.\n\nThey were on the right side of history when they waged a holy war on fossil fuels.\n\nThey were on the right side of history when they proposed a massive wealth transfer to their voter base in the form of a student loan \"forgiveness\" program, and on and on.\n\nTo propose moderation now is to betray a righteous cause - and to shatter the carefully cultivated self-image that provides meaning to so many in the Democratic activist class.\n\nThat's why the mainstream Biden campaign gave way to the militantly leftist Biden administration.\n\nThat's why it's the likes of pugnacious Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett - and not Slotkin, or Pennsylvania's gadfly Sen. John Fetterman - who is being hailed as the future of the party.\n\nAnd if you parse the moderates' words carefully, you'll find that theirs isn't an ideological objection to the progressives' vision, but a tactical one.\n\n\"My district is very different than Alexandria's district,\" Slotkin said soothingly last week, immediately after belittling AOC's lack of anti-Trump accomplishments. \"So I don't fault her for doing what she thinks is right for them.\"\n\nSchumer, for his part, has lashed out at fellow Dems like Nancy Pelosi only to cling to his personal power - not to set his party on a fresh course.\n\nSo if the much-anticipated Democratic civil war breaks out at all, there's no question about who will prevail: One side has already laid down their arms.\n\nIsaac Schorr is a staff writer at Mediaite."

If he secured enough delegates for winning the nomination but dropped out before winning a floor vote at the convention, and if he left a vacancy at the top of the ticket after taking the nomination.\"\n\nBiden, 82, ultimately withdrew from the 2024 presidential race on July 21 amid a revolt from the party following his disastrous June 27 debate performance against Donald Trump - during which he struggled to complete full thoughts and answer questions posed by the CNN moderators.\n\nAccording to Allen and Parnes, top Dems had fretted for months that he wouldn't make it all the way through a grueling campaign.\n\n\"One official involved in secret talks put a fine point on the fear that Biden would not make it to election day as the party's nominee: 'It shows what we had to do to prepare with the unique circumstances we had, which was an 80-plus-year-old president who was running,\" the book claims.\n\nInside the White House, one of the key figures involved with contingency planning was Harris' then-communications director Jamal Simmons - who  even prepared a \"death-pool roster\" of judges who could quickly be called to swear Harris into office, if necessary\n\nSimmons departed his role with Harris at the beginning of January 2023.\n\nWhile he \"never told the vice president about the death-pool roster before leaving her camp,\" he demanded to be \"notified immediately if something happened to Biden, because he had worked out an entire communications strategy,\" Allen and Parnes claim.\n\nSimmons later drew national attention after Trump's election victory for publicly suggesting Biden step down from office before the inauguration so that his old boss could make history as the first female commander in chief.\n\n\"Joe Biden's been a phenomenal president, he's lived up to so many of the promises he's made. There's one promise left that he could fulfill: Being a transitional figure,\" Simmons told CNN at the time. \"He could resign the presidency in the next 30 days, make Kamala Harris president of the United States.\"\n\nBiden did not do that.\n\nThe 46th president had intended to stay in the race even after the debate debacle, but his performance in front of a global audience of millions forced a reckoning.\n\n\"One veteran operative summed up the sentiments of Democrats who worried they would get stuck with Harris but still wanted Biden out: 'Well, at least she has a pulse,'\" Allen and Parnes wrote.\n\nTwo days after the debate, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy hosted a donor reception that Biden attended. The president required fluorescent tape on the floor to function as \"colorful bread crumbs [that] showed the leader of the free world where to walk,\" the book said.\n\nDuring that event, Biden \"didn't look well\" and \"didn't sound vital,\" according to the authors.\n\nDemocratic luminaries privately urged Biden to consider throwing in the towel, with his former boss Barack Obama asking point-blank: \"What is your path?\"\n\n\"What's my path?\" Biden thought, according to the tome. \"What's your f-ing plan?\"\n\nAllen and Parnes have both previously written books on Trump's 2016 election victory and 2020 defeat. Their book is slated for publication April 1.\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "Fetterman urges Democrats to talk like 'regular' people instead of ranting about 'oligarchs'\n\nSen. John Fetterman, D-Pa. , urged members of his party to talk like regular people on Tuesday while pushing back on MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle's questioning about the rise of oligarchs in America.\n\n\"I would just ask Democrats, like, start talking like a regular person. Most people are not sure what an oligarch is, you know?\" Fetterman told Ruhle when pressed on the idea that America was \"creating oligarchs.\"\n\nFetterman, a Democrat who has not held back on criticizing his own party, called out his fellow lawmakers for their protests and antics during President Donald Trump's joint address to Congress, accusing them of making Trump look more presidential.\n\n\"There's also another little secret, too. Democrats, we like billionaires if they're giving to our causes or to our party as well,\" he continued before Ruhle pushed back.\n\nFetterman argued the larger issue was about \"unlimited money,\" which he described as the poison of American democracy.\n\n\"Remember, a lot of these billionaires that were in tech, they used to be more friendly to the Democratic interest and our party,\" he said. \"Unlimited money, get rid of that, and that would transform America more than any single other decision.\"\n\nRuhle pointed out Musk's role in the Trump administration , which is widely criticized by Democrats and members of the media, and argued, \"There's a difference between very wealthy political donors,\" and wealthy individuals inside the government making decisions that could \"enrich themselves and their businesses.\"\n\n\"That's different from being a Democratic donor who has the president's ear or, at the very least, his phone number,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm not sure if they necessarily are motivated just, you know, based on money,\" the Democratic senator argued. \"Whether it's Bezos or Musk, they have far more than you could spend in 100 lifetimes. So, for that, I think scarcity defines the luxury, so that's why a lot of them want to be engaged on that, because they have unlimited money, so I think they want to just be part of the conversation.\"\n\nAsked by Ruhle if he believed their role in government helps their businesses, Fetterman said their businesses might align with the prevailing administration's values.\n\n\"So, for me, they might move [where] a lot of the political waters flow,\" he added. \"I don't think it's billionaires taking over the country, I think it's just people with a lot of money, and we can spontaneously stop it by cutting off unlimited money.\"\n\nFetterman said on social media that his party was becoming like \"metaphorical car alarms\" that no one pays attention to in response to the protests during the president's address.\n\n\"A sad cavalcade of self owns and unhinged petulance. It only makes Trump look more presidential and restrained. We're becoming the metaphorical car alarms that nobody pays attention to-and it may not be the winning message,\" the senator said in a post on X.\n\nHe told Fox News Digital that the 13-year-old cancer survivor, DJ Daniel , who was honored at Trump's address, had a story every member of Congress could celebrate. However, several Democrats remained seated as Trump honored him.\n\n\"I don't know why we can't fully celebrate,\" Fetterman said. \"I mean, I have a 13-year-old myself, and thank God she's never had cancer, but I think that's something we can all celebrate there. And I think it was a touching moment. And, like I said, that's part of the best of the American experience.\"\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "Biden aides, more Democrats pile on ex-prez's offer to boost party fundraising after 2024 disaster: 'This is an SNL skit'\n\nWASHINGTON - Former aides to Joe Biden and other Democratic flacks were aghast Friday following a report that the 46th president recently met with party bosses to offer to put himself back in the spotlight and boost the ailing party's image and fundraising.\n\nBiden, 82, and wife Jill sat down with newly elected Democratic National Committee chairman Ken Martin last month to pitch themselves for a revamped campaigning effort, according to NBC News .\n\nRecent public polling shows Democrats' support has cratered, with less than one-third of Americans approving of the party's performance since President Trump returned to the White House Jan. 20.\n\n\"The Bidens are still living in an alternative universe that revolves only around them,\" a onetime senior White House adviser told The Post in response to the NBC report.\n\n\"Their irresponsibility, family ego and selfishness put the Democratic Party in this position in the first place ... The Biden family - and the disconnected reality that they and their ineffective little circle live in - is responsible for the Trump sequel and the wilderness the Democratic Party finds itself in today,\" this person said.\n\n\"Why?\" asked another former Biden administration official. \"That is my first question.\"\n\n\"They can't raise money either way,\" the source said. \"I think donors would be more inclined to donate if they [the Bidens] were not relevant.\"\n\n\"Joe Biden should enjoy retirement at the beach in Rehoboth,\" a third Biden alum added. \"No voter wants to hear from him. He is delusional and arrogant to think that he can be a value add to the Democratic Party. We need to move on from the era of Joe Biden and embrace new, younger leadership.\"\n\nThe ridicule extended to congressional Democrats, who control neither chamber of Congress following the Nov. 5 wipeout loss by then-Vice President Kamala Harris, who was thrust into the race after Biden announced July 21 he would not seek a second term.\n\n\"Why the f-k would anyone listen to what Joe Biden has to say?\" gasped one congressional Democratic source. \"He should stay in retirement with his pardoned family and keep his mouth shut.\"\n\n\"The best thing Biden could do for the DNC is offer [DNC vice chair] David Hogg a high-paying role at his foundation,\" a congressional Democratic aide snarked.\n\n\"Is this serious?\" a former Democratic aide asked. \"I mean, it has to be a joke. This is an 'SNL' skit.\"\n\nBiden has kept a relatively low profile in retirement - only rarely posting tweets.\n\nIt's unclear how the former chief executive will seek to monetize his post-presidency, though he recently signed with the talent firm Creative Artists Agency , with which he previously partnered to promote his book \"Promise Me, Dad\" after he left office as vice president in 2017.\n\nBiden's son Hunter and brother James Biden reaped millions of dollars for their family based on their proximity to power - hauling in massive amounts from associates in China, Ukraine and other countries where US policy was at one point controlled by their relative.\n\nHunter started a novice art career following his dad's assumption of the presidency, in what was widely seen as a way to further monetize Joe's authority, but said in a recent court filing that he's been unable to make many recent sales.\n\n\"These people drank so much of their own Kool-Aid,\" ranted the ex-senior White House adviser, \"that they believed - and still seemingly believe - that an 82-year-old man with a 38% approval rating on a good day, who can't sit down for a simple traditional 10-minute pre-Super Bowl interview , was the answer for Democrats in 2024 and now this same group thinks the Bidens are the answer for Democrats now?\n\n\"The fact that they continue to surround themselves with the same cast of clowns who delivered them nothing but the most devastating humiliation in modern political history - a president's own power taken away by his own party - is all you need to know about them. They've learned nothing and they are the absolutely last and worst remedy for what ails the party in 2025 and 2026.\"\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "Democrats' approval ratings sink to historic lows amid infighting: poll\n\nDemocrats have become so unpopular that more Americans believe that aliens are among us than agree with the Democratic Party.\n\nDems are now held in lower esteem than lawyers, undertakers, and car salesmen .\n\nTwo punishing new polls released Sunday show that the party has hit historic new lows in approval ratings nationwide - with just 27% of Americans saying they like the job Democrats are doing, according to NBC News .\n\nA CNN poll put favorability at 29% - the lowest rating in the 33-year history of the survey; 54% have an unfavorable view.\n\nAnd neither of those polls take into account the party's latest meltdown.\n\nDemocrats are now mired in back-biting strife over Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's decision not to block a Republican budget bill to avert a partial government shutdown.\n\nEven a lot of Democrats don't like the Democrats these days - just 63% of Dems reported having a favorable view of the party, down 18 points from 81% four years ago, during the start of the Biden administration, according to CNN.\n\nThe tough poll numbers for Dems come as Trump's approval rating hit an all-time high of 47%, per the NBC News poll. Republicans in general, are faring much better, with a 36% favorability rating, the CNN poll found.\n\nMost Dem voters believe that top party brass is steering Democrats in the wrong direction, CNN found.\n\nAnd now it's spilling over - with congressional Democrats openly sniping at Schumer over his decision.\n\n\"The idea that Chuck Schumer is the only one that's got a brain in the room and the only one that can think through all of the pros and cons is absolutely ridiculous,\" Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas) fumed on CNN's \"State of the Union\" Sunday.\n\nModerate and progressive Democratic lawmakers alike felt that the government shutdown fight was the only major leverage against Republicans that they would have for months.\n\nPresident Trump, who enjoys unprecedented executive power along with majorities in both chambers of Congress, has run roughshod over the Democrats with a flurry of executive activity in his first 50 days in office.\n\nCritics of Schumer's decision wanted to use that fight to extract concessions from the GOP on the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and the spending cuts that Republicans are planning.\n\nSchumer, however - along with nine other Democrats - declined to block the GOP bill, saying they believed that allowing the government to shut down would be a loser for the party.\n\nProgressive activists erupted in outrage, and groups such as Indivisible promptly called on Senate Dems to oust the New Yorker from his longtime post.\n\nA Change.org petition to cease donations to the Dems until Schumer steps down quickly garnered over 21,000 signatures.\n\n\"They blew it! The Democratic Tea Party was born the same day that Chuck Schumer took to that podium to read that very well-crafted statement that told us he folded like a paper napkin,\" Symone Sanders-Townsend, a former Harris-aide, turned MSNBC host chided Saturday.\n\nDemocratic leadership appears to be splintering over the party's direction as well.\n\nIn a stunning rebuke from a fellow Brooklyn native, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) refused to say whether he had confidence in his Senate counterpart or whether Schumer should be replaced, illustrating the palpable level of frustration among Dems.\n\n\"Next question,\" Jeffries said during a press conference when asked about Schumer's future as leader of the Senate Dems.\n\nSo far, Democratic lawmakers have steered clear of publicly calling for Schumer to be booted as the No. 1 Senate Dem, though murmurs about his future have spread in private, according to Politico.\n\n\"I think it is a huge slap in the face, and I think that there's a wide sense of betrayal if things proceed as currently planned,\" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), who has been pressured by some progressives to mount a primary challenge against Schumer, told NewsNation last week\n\nOther Senate Democrats have not been shy about ripping into Schumer's approach to the shutdown scrum, either.\n\n\"Americans want the Democratic Party to stand up and fight and to take risks,\" Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) told NBC's \"Meet the Press \" on Sunday. \"If we continue to work with Republicans, if we continue to hand Donald Trump more power, we are going to lose our democracy.\"\n\nPolling echoes Murphy's point, with some 57% of Democrats and aligned Independents wanting the party to focus on countering the GOP agenda instead of partnering with Republicans on bipartisan proposals, according to the CNN survey.\n\nThat's a sharp turnaround from eight years ago, when 74% of Democratic-leaning voters wanted the party to focus on bipartisanship with Republicans rather than focus on fighting the GOP, per the CNN poll.\n\nSignificantly, that poll came before Schumer and nine other Democrats refrained from blocking the GOP bill to forestall a partial government shutdown.\n\nSchumer has shrugged off the backlash. Having spent over a quarter century in the Senate and nearly two decades in the House, he's lived through multiple government shutdowns and did not feel his party was positioned to win this one.\n\n\"It would be a disaster,\" Schumer had warned about a partial shutdown. \"And we have to alert everyone how much pain it would cause the American people.\"\n\nTrump and Republicans have sought to put salt in Schumer's wounds by publicly lauding his efforts to avert a shutdown, knowing full well how progressives will interpret that.\n\n\"AOC has a lot to learn from Chuck Schumer. He did the right thing for America and New York,\" White House spokesperson Alex Pfeiffer needled about the Democratic infighting.\n\nConsternation about Democratic leadership goes deeper than the shutdown row.\n\nSince Trump's return to the White House, Democrats have struggled to navigate his return, with disputes between moderates and progressives over how to calibrate messaging and whether the party should lurch towards the center.\n\nThis past month, for example, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) stoked controversy by suggesting that transgender competition in women's sports is unfair, rankling elements of his base.\n\nThe CNN poll sampled 1,206 adults between March 6-9 and was taken by SSRS with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.3 percentage points. The poll included a subsample of 504 Democratic-leaning voters, which had a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.\n\nAdvertisement"

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to \"deal with it\" on Friday after the congresswoman complained that the Democratic Party needs to fight \"harder.\"\n\n\"This isn't just about Republicans. We need a Democratic Party that fights harder for us, too,\" Ocasio-Cortez told the crowd at a Las Vegas rally on Thursday.\n\nHer comments - part of the far-left \"Squad\" rep's \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour - come a week after 10 Senate Democrats, including Fetterman, joined with Republicans to advance a continuing resolution to keep the government from shutting down.\n\nHouse Democrats nearly unanimously rejected the GOP-crafted six-month spending bill before it went to the Senate and passed with the help of Democrats in the upper chamber.\n\nThe CR vote has sparked intraparty tensions, with several House Democrats, including Ocasio-Cortez, voicing their displeasure with their colleagues in the upper chamber over the vote.\n\nBut Fetterman isn't having it.\n\n\"Fight 'harder' - a stunt that would have harmed millions and plunged us into chaos,\" the Pennsylvania Democrat wrote on X, reacting to a headline highlighting Ocasio-Cortez's comments.\n\n\"We kept our government open. Deal with it,\" the senator added.\n\nOcasio-Cortez isn't the only Democrat criticizing her party in the aftermath of the CR vote.\n\n\"I am disgusted that several Senate Democrats gave up our first point of leverage,\" Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) told attendees at a town hall event in Minnesota Thursday, referring to the CR vote.\n\nThe \"Squad\" lawmaker further argued that Democrats \"have been obsessed with figuring out the perfect message and not doing the perfect thing.\"\n\n\"I do think that there needs to be sort of a come to Jesus moment for Democrats,\" Omar added, arguing that some in the blue party \"want to bring a knife to a gunfight and are not rising up to the moment.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Rep. Glenn Ivey (D-Md.) argued that Senate Democrats need to overhaul their leadership in the wake of the CR vote.\n\n\"I thought it was critical to make sure that we block that bill. I was deeply disappointed that [Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY] voted with the Republicans, \"Ivey told his constituents during a town hall in the eastern suburbs of Washington, DC.\n\n\"I respect Chuck Schumer. I think he's had a great, long-standing career. He's done a lot of great things,\" Ivey continued. \"But I'm afraid that it may be time for the Senate Democrats to pick new leadership as we move forward.\"\n\nSchumer initially signaled that Senate Democrats wouldn't help Republicans advance their spending bill but quickly caved and voted with Republicans on the procedural vote.\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) told reporters earlier this week that she has confidence in Schumer's ability to lead the Democratic caucus in the Senate going forward, but argued that he made too many concessions to Republicans.\n\n\"I myself don't give away anything for nothing,\" Pelosi said. \"I think that's what happened the other day.\""

If Senate Democrats had successfully filibustered the spending bill, they would have been blamed for the resulting shutdown, further tanking the party's image with the middle of the electorate.\n\nIn the fierce backlash against Schumer for saving his party another embarrassment, the left-wing congresswoman from New York, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, is getting promoted as a potential primary challenger to Schumer, and even a national leader for Democrats.\n\nStay up on the very latest with Evening Update.\n\nPlease provide a valid email address.\n\nBy clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy .\n\nNever miss a story.\n\nIn the CNN poll, Democrats were asked which political figure best represents the \"core values\" of their party, and AOC narrowly led.\n\nShe has as good a claim to this title as anyone - and that's the problem.\n\nAOC is Kamala Harris, if the California Democrat hadn't flipped-flopped away from all the fringy things she said in 2019.\n\nShe's Bernie Sanders, if the Vermont socialist were about 50 years younger and could plausibly appear on the cover of Vanity Fair wearing the latest fashion.\n\nShe's Mahmoud Khalil, if the Columbia University activist that the Trump administration wants to deport somehow managed to get himself elected to Congress.\n\nAOC rejects the term \"woke,\" but there is no woke policy that she doesn't support.\n\nShe loved the neologism Latinx (\"gender is fluid, language is fluid\"), and still supports biological males competing in female sports (\"trans girls are girls\").\n\nShe's never met an immigration restriction that she likes.\n\nThe reason Joe Biden won in 2020 is he didn't seem like a progressive, and one reason his party lost in 2024 is that he governed like one.\n\nAOC's brand is the 2024 Biden rather than the 2020 Biden, except even more so.\n\nShe's charismatic and adept at social media, which easily could bring her greater fame and influence, but she's a cartoonish version of the Democratic Party that the GOP hopes to run against.\n\nWill Rogers also once commented, \"You've got to admit that each party is worse than the other.

This kind of antisocial political barbarity is utterly unacceptable in a free country.\n\nThreats of violence cannot be allowed to curtail our freedom of speech.\n\nNor should the extended families of public figures face threats to their lives and safety. The siblings of a Supreme Court justice or the head of DOGE did not choose a public life, and bullying them is disgusting.\n\nSwatting, too, is on the rise, with more than a dozen incidents aimed at right-leaning media figures reported in just the last 10 days.\n\n\"This isn't about politics,\" FBI Director Kash Patel said Friday on X. \"Weaponizing law enforcement against ANY American is not only morally reprehensible but also endangers lives, including those of our officers.\"\n\nSwatting isn't just a scary inconvenience; it has had deadly consequences. Police killed a Kansas man in 2017 after someone called in a fake hostage situation at his address.

Just because swatters use technology, and law enforcement's guns, shouldn't give them a pass on the attempted murder of their political foes.\n\nMeanwhile, there is no federal anti-swatting law, making it harder to prosecute.\n\nRepublicans in Congress must take action. They can reintroduce the Anti-Swatting Act, a 2015 bill that was sponsored by both Democrats and Republicans but never got a floor vote.\n\nCan Democrats really support using our law enforcement to target political enemies?\n\nWorst of all, much of this violence and abuse is being laughed off by people who would be weeping if the targets were their own political allies.\n\nJimmy Kimmel, ostensibly a late-night comedian but in truth more like an angry crank, sarcastically told his audience Tuesday, \"Please don't ever vandalize Tesla vehicles\" - while looking mockingly into the camera, after a long pause, to let them know he meant the opposite.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, last seen as the great male hope of the failed Kamala Harris presidential campaign, told a crowd this week he keeps a finance app on his phone to follow Tesla and to \"give me a little boost\" whenever the stock declines.\n\n\"Two-twenty-five and dropping!\" he exulted.\n\nSuch jeers, as well as the deafening silence from most other Democrats, are simply intolerable.\n\nIf progressive influencers and leftist leaders were on the receiving end of such horrid tactics, every Republican in the country would be made to answer for it. \"This is not who we are,\" right-wing media would proclaim.\n\nAnd rightly so. But no such calls are coming from the Democrats and their media allies.\n\nDonald Trump ran on a platform of law and order. The increasingly rabid reaction to his presidency calls for a serious response.\n\nFor the last five years, the violent left has run rampant with few consequences for the chaos it has sown.\n\nRepublicans in Congress, and the Trump Justice Department, should show them that ends now.\n\nKarol Markowicz is co-author of the book \"Stolen Youth.\""

      "text": "Democrats WILL regret cheering as Tesla terrorism rages on\n\nThe dark night of political violence keeps getting predicted on the right while actually descending on the left.\n\nHere we go again: There's a campaign of terror against Tesla to protest Elon Musk's politics.\n\nDemocrats aren't acting as if they intend to do anything to stop it.\n\nIn Las Vegas last week, five cars at a Tesla service center were set on fire and shot at .\n\nTexas police found \"multiple incendiary devices\" at a Tesla dealership in north Austin. Other explosives have been found in San Antonio , where the FBI is dispatching experts.\n\nThe Justice Department, which has announced a task force to address the problem, has already brought federal charges against a man in Salem, Ore. \"armed with a suppressed AR-15 rifle,\" who \"was arrested after throwing approximately eight Molotov cocktails at a Tesla dealership,\" a woman \"arrested in Loveland, Col. after attempting to light Teslas on fire with Molotov cocktails,\" and a man in Charleston, SC, who \"wrote profane messages against President Trump around Tesla charging stations before lighting [them] on fire with Molotov cocktails.\"\n\nThe violence has gone international, with 80 Tesla vehicles damaged in an attack in Hamilton, Ontario. The list goes on.\n\nTerrorism is the use of violence to achieve political ends. When the government or people engaged in politics change their behavior for fear of it, that's how terrorism succeeds.\n\nBy any definition, this is terrorism.\n\nIt's aimed at getting Musk to stop supporting Donald Trump, disband his Department of Government Efficiency, change his recommendations for cutting government, stop donating to Republicans or otherwise leave the public square.\n\nAs the campaign of bombings of cars with combustible batteries drags on and armed vandals attack dealerships, it's only a matter of time before somebody dies.\n\nWhen that happens, Democrats will regret not doing more to distance themselves from this spate of violence.\n\nThey're not doing much of that right now.\n\nDemocratic Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett told a \"Tesla Takedown\" digital rally , \"All I want to see happen on my birthday is for Elon to be taken down.\"\n\nAs the violence takes a toll on Tesla sales and the company's stock slumps, Crockett says that \"there is only one language that the people that are in charge understand right now, and that language is money.\"\n\nCrockett insists she is talking only about \"peaceful\" protest.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz told a crowd that the falling price made him happy: \"On the iPhone, they've got that little stock app. I added Tesla to it to give me a little boost during the day - $225 and dropping.\"\n\nHe also suggested defacing your own Tesla: \"You can take dental floss and pull the Tesla thing off.\"\n\nWalz had to apologize after it was pointed out that Minnesota's pension fund for public employees was heavily invested in Tesla stock.\n\nThe Lincoln Project's Rick Wilson, a campaign consultant supporting Democrats, wrote an essay headlined, \"Kill Tesla, Save the Country,\" calling the company \"a bank for fascists.\"\n\nJimmy Kimmel made it a punchline : \"Don't ever vandalize Tesla vehicles,\" he said, followed by a winking look at the camera while his audience roared with laughter.\n\nMany other prominent Democrats have just kept silent, seeing nothing worth denouncing.\n\nThat won't cut it.\n\nSubscribe to our daily Post Opinion newsletter!\n\nPlease provide a valid email address.\n\nBy clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy .\n\nNever miss a story.\n\nPoliticians aren't responsible when one random crackpot takes things too far. But this is an ongoing campaign of violence, using common tactics with a common target toward a common end.\n\nInstead of appealing for calm, too many Democrats are sitting back and letting it happen - while their party's most belligerent voices keep fanning the flames.\n\nEven the most righteous causes need leaders to step up and say how far is too far.\n\nAbraham Lincoln and other anti-slavery Republicans denounced John Brown. Pro-life groups have been vocal for years against violence against abortion providers, which was more common 30 years ago.\n\nBut the same people who knelt for the George Floyd rioters, the same leaders who incited protest mobs and assassination threats at the homes of Supreme Court justices, the same movement that let pro-Hamas terror run free on campus, and the same party whose socialist wing celebrates Luigi Mangione for murdering a health-insurance CEO?\n\nThey are not so righteous.\n\nDan McLaughlin is a senior writer at National Review.

      "text": "Democrats knew the risks with Biden. Why weren't they better prepared?\n\nA new round of finger-pointing among Democrats about the 2024 presidential election raises more questions than it answers, chief among them why the party wasn't better prepared for the possibility that former President Joe Biden might not be up for a reelection bid.\n\nBiden turned 82 shortly after Election Day. He was already the oldest person to ever serve as president. He had considered serving only one term if elected as far back as 2019. Once Biden got to the White House , he did not commit to seeking a second term until 2023.\n\nA new book claims that Democrats did have contingency plans a year before the election for what they would do if Biden either died in office or dropped out of the presidential race. Those plans did not, however, include a competitive Democratic primary process with alternative 2024 candidates.\n\n\"A handful of Democratic National Committee officials already had considered contingency plans,\" reporters Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes write in Fight: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House , which comes out on Tuesday. \"In hush-hush talks starting in 2023, these officials gamed out Biden-withdrawal scenarios, according to two people familiar with them.\"\n\n\"They wanted to make sure the party was ready for every possible circumstance: if Biden launched his campaign and then stepped aside before the primaries; if he won a bunch of primaries and then could not continue. If he secured enough delegates for winning the nomination but dropped out before winning a floor vote at the convention, and if he left a vacancy at the top of the ticket after taking the nomination,\" Allen and Parnes continued.\n\nYet Democrats were seemingly caught flat-footed when Biden bombed in a debate with then-former President Donald Trump and took nearly a month to dislodge the president from the top of their 2024 ticket.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris seemed ill-prepared to step in for Biden and campaign in his shadow, even though she was serving as vice president under an octogenarian. (Elsewhere in the Allen-Parnes book, Biden is said to have resisted any Harris efforts to distance herself from him in order to win the election.) This is despite top Harris aides having \"strategized around the possibility that Biden might die in office.\"\n\nDemocrats did not initially appear to have a lot of confidence in Harris to replace Biden. Her performance as vice president up to that point had been widely panned. Her approval ratings were low. She had significant staff turnover. She had to abandon her own bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination before the first primary votes were cast.\n\n\"One veteran operative summed up the sentiments of Democrats who worried they would get stuck with Harris but still wanted Biden out: 'Well, at least she has a pulse,'\" Allen and Parnes write.\n\n\"For months, even those now nudging Biden out the door haven't been confident that Harris would be a winning presidential candidate, reviving some of the same concerns that sank her White House run and dogged an uneven vice presidency,\" Politico reported the day before Biden dropped out.\n\nAs Biden deliberated over what to do in the weeks following his disastrous debate performance, there were multiple media reports of him asking advisers if Harris could win if he departed the race.\n\n\"He's gone from saying, 'Kamala can't win,' to 'Do you think Kamala can win?\" CNN quoted an unnamed Democrat as saying three days before Biden threw in the towel. \"It's still unclear where he's going to land but seems to be listening.\"\n\nBut the bottom line is that Biden did not pick someone he had confidence in as a successor, despite that being the main purpose of the vice presidency. Harris seemingly hadn't given much thought as to how she would escape Biden's negatives if she did succeed him before the election. And even though some Democrats were reportedly worried Biden was going to die before the election, there were no major primary challengers.\n\nIt is possible that in the aftermath of George Floyd 's death in police custody, Biden thought he needed to pick a black woman. Black Democrats saved his 2020 presidential campaign in South Carolina. It is not obvious in retrospect that Karen Bass, another Democrat on Biden's vice presidential short list who is now the embattled mayor of Los Angeles, would have been obviously better than Harris.\n\nYet it seems more likely that Biden, who had been trying to become president since at least 1987 and finally won the office 33 years later, was never going to go quietly. He chose a running mate who was good insurance for him keeping the job he long wanted rather than someone who could easily step in at a moment's notice, despite his advanced age.\n\nIn light of that, Democrats feared a primary challenger would not result in a new nominee, but would further weaken Biden in the general election. This had been the history of Gerald Ford when he was challenged by Ronald Reagan in 1976, Jimmy Carter when he was challenged by Ted Kennedy in 1980, and George H.W. Bush when he was challenged by Pat Buchanan in 1992.\n\nSHINING 'DAYLIGHT' ON HOW DEMOCRATS BLEW THE 2024 ELECTION\n\nThe Democrats also lost when Lyndon Johnson dropped out in 1968, standing aside for his vice president , Hubert Humphrey. And they lost again last year when the same scenario played out with Biden and Harris.\n\nThe Democrats' preparation for life after Biden came to naught."

      "text": "Democrats face uphill battle to retake Senate\n\nDemocrats are shut out of power in Washington, D.C. , but they hope that doesn't last long. Historically speaking, the midterm elections offer an opportunity to rein in a political party that controls the elected branches of the federal government.\n\nThat currently describes Republicans under President Donald Trump . Democrats earnestly believe they can make next year's elections a referendum on Trump - and even more so, fellow billionaire and chief government-cutter Elon Musk - and win back Congress while perhaps avoiding an extensive rebranding campaign in the wake of their 2024 losses .\n\nHistory notwithstanding, that may be easier said than done. While Republicans have only the narrowest of majorities in the House, they currently hold 53 Senate seats, most of them in relatively safe red states, and next year's map for the upper chamber is in their favor.\n\nYes, Democrats only have to defend 13 Senate seats next year to the Republicans' 22, but Republicans are trying to hold a seat in just one state carried by former Vice President Kamala Harris , the 2024 Democratic presidential nominee. Democrats are trying to retain two seats in states won by Trump last year, plus five more where Harris had a single-digit margin of victory. Democratic incumbents are retiring in three of those seven states.\n\nThe Democrats' top pickup opportunities are probably in Maine, where Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), first elected in 1996, won her 2020 reelection bid by 8.6 percentage points even as future President Joe Biden carried the state by 9.1 points, and North Carolina. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) has won two competitive senatorial elections in this battleground state, defeating North Carolina's last incumbent Democratic senator in 2014. Trump took North Carolina by single-digit margins in the last three presidential elections. No Democratic nominee for the White House has prevailed there since Barack Obama in 2008.\n\nConsequently, things are not quite as bad for Senate Democrats as they were last year, but they are bad enough that Republicans could hold the Senate even if there is a Democratic wave election next year. That's what happened in Trump's first midterm election, back in 2018, when Democrats captured the House but lost red-state Senate races. Progressives have complained that the Senate is structurally biased in favor of Republicans, like the Electoral College.\n\nOther Democrats make more modest claims. Top Democratic data scientist David Shor said in his 2024 election postmortem that \"something has to change in order for us to have a majority that's capable of securing the Senate.\"\n\nRepublicans hope to unseat Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-GA), especially if Gov. Brian Kemp (R-GA) decides to run. Republicans were able to force a runoff against Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-GA) in 2022 with a flawed candidate in retired football star Herschel Walker. Warnock and Ossoff won their seats in early 2021 runoffs after Trump lost Georgia and the presidency. Trump won the state and the White House back last year.\n\nSens. Gary Peters (D-MI), Tina Smith (D-MN), and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) are retiring. None of these races would be a shoo-in for Republicans. Michigan was the only one of these states Trump won last year, and even that wasn't enough to deliver the state's other Senate seat to the GOP column. Winning these seats without Trump on the ballot but with anti-Trump voters presumably flooding to the polls would be challenging.\n\nNevertheless, Democrats would be forced to spend money and play defense in all of these states as long as there were competent Republican Senate nominees. If the national mood is less uniformly Democratic, or at least anti-Trump, it's possible these races would become more winnable. Former New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, a Republican, could by himself put the Granite State's seat in play. In the worst-case scenario, Democrats would have to pour millions of dollars into the race, as they did in Maryland last year when former Gov. Larry Hogan ran for Senate.\n\nThere are a few things Democrats could do to try to expand the map. Former Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who was defeated last year, is said to be eyeing a comeback run in 2026. He lost to Sen. Bernie Moreno (R-OH) in part because Trump, who won statewide by double digits, was on the ballot. Brown would presumably be a formidable candidate if he decided to run. Former Rep. Tim Ryan ran a competitive race for that seat against JD Vance, now the vice president, in 2022. But if the election is suitably nationalized, this might be a stretch.\n\nSen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) is the big GOP retirement this cycle. There is likely to be a competitive primary to replace him after his nearly 42 years in the Senate. But if Ohio is now a red state at the federal level, Kentucky makes it look purple by comparison. Gov. Andy Beshear (D-KY) would be the top Democratic recruit to make it a race. But political heterodoxies states are willing to overlook in their governors aren't always accepted in Senate candidates (Mitt Romney was governor of deep-blue Massachusetts but had to move to Utah to be elected to the Senate).\n\nPerhaps even more importantly, Beshear is a possible 2028 presidential candidate. Short-timers have abandoned the Senate for higher office before, but this would be an especially quick turnaround that might work against him. And that is assuming he won. A loss would damage his presidential prospects. Beshear would also have to take positions to win a Senate seat in Kentucky that would hurt him in a national Democratic primary. He is already taking potshots at Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) for cozying up to conservatives in a possible sign he knows that as a Democratic presidential contender, he would need to run to the left in the primary, at least.\n\nWe don't know yet what the political climate will look like, nationally or in the battleground states. The Trump administration is moving quickly, as if it realizes its opportunities might be limited after the midterm elections (this also suggests that despite Democratic fearmongering to the contrary, it is preparing for Trump to become a lame-duck president sometime in 2027).\n\nIt is easy to imagine voters deciding they don't like the pace of change under Trump, even if they are broadly sympathetic to some of his policy goals. They could also react negatively to the implementation of specific things, such as the Department of Government Efficiency and tariffs. The early dips in the stock market as the second Trump administration started to take shape might only have been the beginning of wider economic problems.\n\nIf the public has turned on Trump by then - and there are bright red warning signs that voters don't think he is focused enough on inflation and the economic concerns that helped return him to office - Democrats won't necessarily have to reinvent themselves. In a two-party system, they will be the only viable alternative. And it is possible to vote for a divided government without fully embracing Democratic progressivism.\n\nAfter Obama was elected, Republicans largely ignored their after-action reports and the advice of their leading strategists. Some winnable races were surely lost as a result, and a persistent governing problem has remained unresolved. But when the public got tired of Obama, there was nowhere else to turn. The tea party won Congress in 2010 and 2014, overthrowing Democratic supermajorities in the process. Trump was elected to his first term in 2016 and has been the ultimate political survivor ever since, though he did represent a shift in the party's approach in ways the infamous GOP autopsy never anticipated.\n\nDemocrats may be similarly able to recover despite their flawed leaders and penchant for taking the wrong side of 80-20 issues in public opinion, simply by being the only Plan B available whenever Trump finally wears out his welcome as he has done, however temporarily, once before. But the Democrats' favorability ratings are low, and the party doesn't seem ready for its Clintonian pivot to the center. Perhaps the bottom never truly drops out for Trump with DOGE and the tariffs. The hard economic data so far look more promising than consumer and business confidence, though it should be remembered that Biden-Harris team members tried to assure each other that inflation-induced anxieties were just passing \"vibes,\" as transitory as they initially claimed inflation itself was.\n\nSuffice it to say, however, that it is not yet clear whether the town hall protests, Tesla-bashing, and big rallies for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) are a sign of huge progressive energy or a get-out-the-vote driver for conservatives.\n\nOr both. There is also the possibility of a split verdict. So far, 2018 has been the last wave election. It was largely a blue one. Democrats gained 41 House seats and the majority. But they experienced a net loss of two Senate seats as Republicans held their majority there, thanks to a conservative backlash against the Democrats in the redder states that were up for election that year. If the battleground states vote to the right of the country as a whole, that could happen again, even if the Resistance comes into play.\n\nThe Senate hasn't always been bad news for Democrats, however, and the battleground states haven't always voted to the right of the national electorate. \"In 2020, we won basically every competitive Senate race,\" Shor said of Democrats in his recent postmortem. \"And in both 2022 and 2024, we saw something that I had never seen before, which is that we did a lot better in swing Senate races than we did nationally.\"\n\nTRUMP, CHAOS, COMPETENCE, AND A CONTROVERSIAL SIGNAL GROUP CHAT\n\n\"But a lot of that was the other side running terrible candidates,\" he added. \"And we can't count on that happening forever. And even despite that - even despite historically well-run campaigns and historically weak opposition - here we are four years later at 47 Senate seats and with a very difficult path to getting back to 50 even in a wave Democratic year.\"\n\nEven if a lot goes wrong for Trump in the next 19 months, Democratic Senate candidates will need quite a lot to go right.\n\nW.

      "text": "Progressive lawmakers fill leadership vacuum after Democrats' 2024 losses\n\nProgressive lawmakers are stepping into the political vacuum left by former President Joe Biden as Democrats search for leaders who will challenge Republicans' newfound control of Washington.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), once marginalized by his own party establishment, is now embraced as a conduit for the grassroots anger directed at President Donald Trump . Sanders has brought eye-popping crowds to a string of rallies while raising millions at a time when Democratic coffers are drying up.\n\nMeanwhile, the Left is finding a new appetite for its no-compromise style of politics as polling shows the Democratic Party underwater with its own voters. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), in particular, has fueled resentment toward the Democratic establishment after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) caved to Republicans in a fight over government funding.\n\nBoth progressive icons were surrogates for Biden, an unpopular incumbent who embraced liberal policies in exchange for their support. Their loyalty then shifted to Vice President Kamala Harris as she mounted an ill-fated campaign to replace him on the Democratic ticket.\n\nBut the outcome of the 2024 election, in which Democrats lost both the White House and Senate, is allowing them to trade their pragmatism for the grassroots agitating that first catapulted them to national prominence. The Democrats lack a figurehead until the next presidential race, leaving a void for Sanders and his progressive colleagues to fill.\n\n\"If you're looking for that one charismatic leader to identify as the leader of the movement, it's going to be a couple of years before that, because that's structural,\" said Sen. Brian Schatz (D-HI), a progressive member of Democrats' Senate leadership team. \"That's what happens when you lose the House, the Senate, and the presidency.\"\n\n\"The good news is that we have more fired-up people with more ideological and geographic diversity than any time I've ever seen in politics,\" he added. \"The bad news is we're out of power.\"\n\nThere is nothing especially new about Sanders's message as he hops from state to state, bringing with him Ocasio-Cortez and other lawmakers. Elon Musk, the de facto head of Trump's agency-slashing Department of Government Efficiency, has become the new boogeyman for Sanders's decadeslong warnings about an entrenched class of billionaires.\n\nBut even Sanders has expressed surprise at crowd sizes that seem to eclipse the audiences he drew in 2016 and 2020, when he challenged Biden and before that Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination for president.\n\nHis political team estimates that 108,000 people have attended his \"Fight Oligarchy\" tour, with 34,000 in Denver alone. Ocasio-Cortez will join Sanders again for an April 12 event in Los Angeles, according to a Friday advisory.\n\n\"I mean, people want to be plugged into action, and he's providing people with that outlet,\" Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT), an ally of Sanders, told the Washington Examiner . \"This is not a moment when we're asking people to do something and they won't do it. They're hungry.\"\n\nMurphy subsequently announced that he would be traveling to Warren, Michigan, on Saturday for a joint town hall with Rep. Maxwell Frost (D-FL), a Gen Z House Democrat.\n\n\"I think it's stunning the numbers he's getting,\" Murphy added of Sanders. \"I hope he does more of it, and I hope the rest of us get on the road too.\"\n\nThe appetite for action is a double-edged sword for Democrats. It comes at the expense of party leadership, panned by the Left as weak in the face of Trump's sweeping rollback of the federal government. In speeches, Ocasio-Cortez has called for the party to support \"brawlers\" who will fight harder to oppose Trump and criticized Schumer directly after his government funding vote.\n\nIt has also given Republicans a fresh chance to tie Democrats to the most extreme elements of their party following a backlash to the \"defund the police\" and other left-wing movements. Multiple polls have found the Democratic Party with the lowest favorability rating on record, driven by a desire for Democrats to stand in the way of Trump.\n\n\"The Democrat Party's approval rating has hit a record low of 27 percent because they've become antagonists of common sense,\" Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-CA) said on X. \"Now, they're empowering Bernie and AOC while egging on the disruptive tactics of radical far-left groups. I doubt this helps their cause.\"\n\nStill, the prospect of an animated Democratic base is tantalizing for the party as it seeks to claw back the House in next year's midterm elections. Both Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez are giving voice to Democratic dissatisfaction with leadership while reserving most of their ire for Trump as he shutters agencies and slashes thousands of federal jobs.\n\n\"He's handed the keys to Elon Musk and is selling this country for parts to the richest people on the planet for a kickback,\" Ocasio-Cortez said in Nevada last week.\n\nThe leadership vacuum has set off a wave of early jockeying for a presidential election that is still years away. Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA), long a progressive champion, has tacked to the right with a more centrist tone on transgender rights. He's also flirted with the MAGA Right, inviting prominent voices like Charlie Kirk onto his new podcast.\n\nNewsom is one in a deep bench of Democratic governors stoking 2028 speculation, while Ocasio-Cortez herself is thought to have ambitions for higher office. She was most recently encouraged to run for Schumer's Senate seat when he comes up for reelection in 2028.\n\nIn the short term, progressive lawmakers are rushing to fill the gulf left by Biden. Murphy, who has urged Senate leadership to take a harder line on Trump, fundraised off his refusal to be \"steamrolled\" in the government funding fight earlier this month and on Friday sent an email to supporters soliciting donations for his rally in Michigan.\n\nHe will be traveling to the state's 10th Congressional District, one of dozens of battlegrounds that will determine control of the House in 2026.\n\n\"This is how we win. This is how we fight back against the corruption, the destruction of our democracy and Trump and Musk's illegal power grab,\" Murphy said in his fundraising email. \"We go everywhere. We take this debate to every corner of the nation - especially where Republicans are hiding from the people. We put pressure on them in their own backyard.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez, speaking in Tucson, Arizona, last week, urged rallygoers to mobilize for races up and down the ballot, calling community organizing the key to Democratic success.\n\n\"I'm here to remind you that we are not powerless in this moment,\" Ocasio-Cortez said.\n\nNotably, her call to action includes rejecting ideological purity tests and instead realigning the Democratic coalition around \"class solidarity.\" Her message is part of a larger recalibration by Democrats as they seek to reclaim the working-class voters who have gravitated to Republicans under Trump.\n\n\"I think that we have to grow the party. And we are not in the winnowing-down phase. We are in the rebuilding phase,\" Schatz said. \"If people have views that I find weird or objectionable, but they want to vote for Democrats, they are welcome. If there are some pro-life gubernatorial candidates in a red state, God bless. I'll send them a check.\"\n\n\"My view is that politics is addition, not subtraction, and we have to say that to ourselves every morning, even when it's painful,\" he added.\n\nThe thrust of their big tent strategy centers on rekindling the opposition to Trump that defined his arrival in the White House in 2017. Democrats have attempted to portray Republicans as cutting critical social services to pay for tax breaks for the rich.\n\nBut Trump's return to power has also laid bare a schism between the Left and the more pragmatic party leadership. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), the top Democrat in the House, virtually unified his caucus against the government funding bill earlier this month, yet Schumer's refusal to do so in the Senate, arguing that a shutdown was a political loser for Democrats, has spawned an upswell in anti-establishment sentiment not seen since the Tea Party era.\n\nAlready, a younger generation of Democrats is challenging established House members , even those with long progressive records. One of the latest, Kat Abughazaleh, a 26-year-old influencer, will attempt to unseat Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), who has represented Illinois in the House since 1999.\n\nAt 83, Sanders is unlikely to mount another run for president but has used his rallies to elevate younger voices including Rep. Greg Casar (D-TX), the chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.\n\nOther liberal voices, including Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX), have courted controversy in a bid to build notoriety.\n\nFor Ocasio-Cortez, the grassroots anger offers her a chance to stand at odds with party leadership amid growing complaints that she is going \"mainstream\" on the Left.\n\nShe has taken a series of baby steps toward joining House leadership since her shock defeat of Rep. Joe Crowley, seen as a possible successor to former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), in 2018.\n\nSCHUMER'S GRIP ON NEW YORK LOOSENS UNDER TRUMP 2.0\n\nOcasio-Cortez privately suggested to colleagues last year that she might no longer meddle in primary races, after years of supporting progressive challengers, and has begun contributing to House Democrats' campaign arm despite previously swearing off the practice.\n\nLast year, she endorsed Harris despite offering a protest endorsement of Sanders at Biden's nominating convention four years earlier."

      "text": "Warning signs for Democrats and Republicans ahead of next elections\n\nBoth parties are seeing mixed signals from the data 19 months ahead of the 2026 midterm elections , less than 100 days into President Donald Trump 's second term.\n\nTrump's support is softening amid economic worries, and there are growing signs of rage on the Left, though the Democratic Party remains deeply unpopular and shows little indication of being able to capitalize on either trend.\n\nEven with some slippage, Trump is posting better numbers than he has for most of his decade atop the national political scene. According to a polling aggregate by CNN's Harry Enten, Trump's favorability ratings, though slightly underwater, are higher this month than at a comparable point in 2017 or when he won the election in November.\n\nSimilarly, while a small majority of people still tell pollsters the country is on the wrong track, the percentage saying it is moving in the right direction has spiked since Trump took office. That number is at 40% or higher in six of the seven polls included in the latest RealClearPolitics average. An NBC News poll recorded its highest right direction percentage since 2004, Marist since 2009.\n\nMany voters who cast their ballots for Trump like what he is doing and are happier than when former President Joe Biden was in office. Those who pulled the lever for former Vice President Kamala Harris are unhappier, but there was a certain amount of progressive discontent with Biden.\n\nDemocrats hope all these numbers will get much worse for Trump as tariffs and the uncertainty surrounding their implementation sap the economy. They also believe their base's backlash against Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency will spread to the rest of the electorate as essential public services are eventually affected.\n\nHistorically, the party controlling the White House loses congressional seats in the midterm elections. Right now, Republicans hold what political analysts like to call the \"trifecta\" - the House, Senate, and presidency.\n\nBut Republicans underperformed in a similar scenario in 2022, winning the House but falling short of taking control of the Senate back from the Democrats. Other exceptions to the general rule include the 2002 midterm elections, which occurred a little more than a year after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and the 1998 elections that took place after congressional Republicans impeached then-President Bill Clinton.\n\nThere are also fewer swing districts than before, as Republicans already hold the reddest and Democrats the bluest seats in the country. This was a problem for House Republicans in 2022 and could hamper their Democratic counterparts next year.\n\nDemocrats held their own in the Senate, actually picking up a seat in 2022, thanks in part to weak Republican candidates. But that only got them from 50-50, with Harris breaking ties, to 51-49. After last year's elections, Democrats are down to 47 Senate seats against the GOP's 53.\n\nDemocrats posted record-low favorability ratings in recent polls. CNN found 29% viewed the party favorably, the lowest in the network's polling dating back to 1992. NBC News also found just 27% viewed the Democrats favorably, a low in their polling since 1990. At least some of this is progressive disenchantment with the party rather than a swing to the right, however.\n\nThe angry protests spearheaded by the likes of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), along with the organized demonstrations at Republican lawmakers' town hall meetings, could be a sign of organic progressive energy. Or, along with anti-Tesla violence targeting Musk's bottom line, they could repel the wider electorate.\n\nYet Democrats still have hope even without a course correction or DOGE and the tariffs eroding Trump's standing. Their base now includes many high-propensity voters sure to show up for the midterm elections. Republicans may struggle to turn out the lower-propensity voters who brought Trump back to the White House without the president himself on the ballot.\n\nDemocrats won a special election in Pennsylvania this week in a predominantly Republican district. Democrats also flipped an Iowa state Senate seat eight weeks earlier and only narrowly lost a special House election in the Hawkeye State earlier this month, suggesting the pattern of overperformance in the off-year elections may be continuing. Republicans are currently worried about a special congressional election in Florida next week.\n\nTHE CENTRISTS ARE LOSING THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S CIVIL WAR\n\nThe two parties are closely matched in generic congressional ballot polls, in which respondents say whether they want Capitol Hill to be run by Republicans or Democrats.\n\nTrump is proceeding as if he needs to get as much as possible done before the midterm elections, and the inevitable subsequent shift to the 2028 presidential election, in which he is currently constitutionally ineligible to run. Republicans will defend a razor-thin House majority next year."

      "text": "House Democrats draw progressive challengers in fight over Trump resistance\n\nDemocrats are getting a taste of their base's fury as progressives begin to challenge established House incumbents they say are not fighting President Donald Trump hard enough.\n\nIn the weeks since Trump returned to the White House, Democrats have been raising the alarm bells over a constitutional crisis they say the president is fueling with his sweeping rollback of the federal government. At the same time, Democrats are warning of cuts to Medicaid and other entitlements as House Republicans move to pass Trump's agenda.\n\nThe messaging has served to channel and amplify grassroots fears over what the next four years hold under Trump, with an eye on returning to the House majority in 2026 . Democrats are primed to have a motivated base in what are often lower turnout off-year elections.\n\nBut the anger Trump is fostering on the Left is also coming back to haunt House Democrats. The party failed to put limits on Trump as part of this month's funding battle, a moment that crystallized calls for older and more establishment Democrats to step aside.\n\nNow, progressives are attempting to fill the gap with runs that could divert Democratic resources to a slate of primary races next year.\n\nSomeone already mounting a challenge is Kat Abughazaleh, a 26-year-old progressive influencer seeking to topple Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), 80. Abughazaleh's campaign says she raised over $250,000 in the roughly 48 hours after she announced her bid.\n\nSchakowsky, who has represented Illinois's 9th Congressional District since 1999 and is regarded as a progressive herself, told reporters she hasn't \"totally made up my mind yet\" on whether she plans to run for reelection, but she struck a defiant tone when asked about the primary race.\n\n\"If I decide to run, I'll win. I'll tell you that,\" the congresswoman said.\n\nAbughazaleh is already capitalizing on the controversy surrounding Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) after he handed Republicans the votes to fund the government this month without any concessions in return. House Democrats were virtually united in opposing the GOP-crafted bill and several called for Schumer to step down from leadership afterward, but the episode exposed a schism that has animated progressives.\n\n\"We can't bow down to Trump,\" Abughazaleh said in a post on X. \"Unlike Chuck Schumer and Dick Durbin, I will never capitulate to authoritarians.\"\n\nEven former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is attracting a challenger - Saikat Chakrabarti, a 39-year-old former aide to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) - though attempts to primary the Democratic powerhouse have failed over the last few cycles.\n\nIn his campaign launch, Chakrabarti praised Pelosi's tenure but argued that \"we are living in a totally different America than the one she knew when she entered politics 45 years ago.\"\n\n\"The Democratic Party needs to stop acting like it's competing against a normal political party that plays by the rules, and it needs a bold vision for how to raise living standards, quality of life and security for all Americans,\" Chakrabarti said . \"America is stuck, and Americans want real solutions that are as big as the problems we face.\"\n\nIn a statement to the Washington Examiner , Chakrabarti said his campaign offers \"comprehensive and practical solutions.\" In his view, the Democrats have \"no idea\" how to handle America being \"in decline.\"\n\n\"Neither does Trump, but at least he's taking American's reality seriously, even though his response is a joke,\" he said. \"The Dems need a new leadership that proposes a real plan to actually make life better for Americans. That's the only way they win in 2028 and if they don't bring that plan to the table, they don't deserve to win.\"\n\nThe campaign cycle won't pick up in earnest until next year, but members are already predicting more contested primaries will emerge from the party infighting.\n\n\"I think we will see more primary challenges,\" one House Democrat told the Washington Examiner . \"The electorate is anxious and angry and deeply concerned about the future. And they want to see a new generation of leaders.\"\n\n\"Whether they will be successful in their challenges is another story. Incumbents are tough to beat,\" the lawmaker continued. \"But I think you will see energy to field new candidates.\"\n\nDemocrats faced a generational reckoning shortly after the 2024 elections. Many freshman Democrats criticized their elder colleagues and called for a period of reflection after historically blue voting blocs trended toward Republicans.\n\nAt the end of last year, Ocasio-Cortez and several other younger members challenged long-standing ranking members on powerful committees as a form of protest.\n\nRep. Angie Craig (D-MN), 53, successfully unseated Rep. David Scott (D-GA), 79, as the top Democrat on the House Agriculture Committee. Scott is now facing a primary challenge from Georgia state Sen. Emanuel Jones, 69.\n\nRep. Jared Huffman (D-CA) challenged the late Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-AZ) to become the ranking member of the Natural Resources Committee, but Grijalva bowed out of the race before it could become a competitive contest.\n\nNot all challengers were so lucky. Ocasio-Cortez sought to become the ranking member of the Oversight Committee but lost to Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-VA). Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX), quickly becoming one of the most vocal House Democrats this year, lost her bid to become head of the Democrats' campaign messaging arm to Democratic Policy and Communications Committee Chairwoman Debbie Dingell (D-MI).\n\nStill, Ocasio-Cortez could have another shot at generational change. After Schumer's spending deal fiasco, several progressive Democrats reportedly reached out to Ocasio-Cortez encouraging her to primary Schumer for New York's U.S. Senate seat in 2028.\n\nDEMOCRATS FACE GLOOMY REALITY AS UNPOPULAR POLICIES BLEED INTO ELECTORAL MATH\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) acknowledged that \"there is a lot of energy, a lot of angst, a lot of anxiety\" within the Democratic grassroots over the party not using all legislative tools available to them to counter Trump.\n\n\"Our focus is going to be, stop bad things from happening to the American people, and there'll be a time and place where the politics will take care of itself,\" Jeffries said.\n\nLauren Green contributed to this report."

      "text": "Rust Belt Democrats in a balancing act over Trump's auto tariffs\n\nPresident Donald Trump 's decision to place 25% tariffs on the auto industry has some Democrats in the upper Midwest walking a fine line between opposing the administration and welcoming its economic measures that could aid the region's once-prosperous auto industry.\n\nThe Democratic Party has been bleeding working-class support, and Trump further swayed the voting bloc toward his base in the 2024 election. Democratic lawmakers who represent areas that once housed large working-class employment in the auto industry want to convey their opposition to Trump's agenda, but they are split on his tariff plans.\n\nRep. Debbie Dingell (D-MI) said in a statement that the tariff plan \"appears to be a step toward on-shoring supply chains and bringing manufacturing back to our country\" and that she \"will work with anyone to support these goals.\" The high-ranking Democrat added a caveat to her support, however.\n\n\"We need to remember we must allow the auto companies and suppliers the time they need to adjust - production changes can't take place overnight,\" Dingell said. \"Our domestic auto industry relies on a closely integrated North American supply chain, which is why it's important this includes exceptions for USMCA-compliant imports. However, it is time to renegotiate\" the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.\n\n\"Stronger protection for American-made cars and trucks is long overdue,\" Rep. Haley Stevens (D-MI) said in a statement . \"I welcome that, but we need to fully understand the details.\"\n\nRep. Gwen Moore (D-WI), a sharp Trump critic, told Politico that she views tariffs as \"a tool, just like fire.\"\n\n\"You can barbecue with it, or you can burn your house down, depending on how you use it,\" she said.\n\nRep. Marcy Kaptur (D-OH) declined to take a stance on the proposed tariffs, instead calling for broader measures to revitalize American manufacturing.\n\n\"We must do more to address the U.S. manufacturing and technology job washout in the automotive and transportation industries,\" Kaptur said in a statement. \"This will require a lot more than a 25% tariff on automotive imports. We must reinvest in American manufacturing and the working-class communities across our country that have been hollowed out due to broken trade deals and the burden of outsourcing.\"\n\nSome Rust Belt Democrats have stood firm in their opposition to Trump's use of tariffs. Rep. Shri Thanedar (D-MI) said in a statement that he is supportive of \"efforts to strengthen the manufacturing industry and the jobs they create\" but that tariffs are \"not the way to accomplish that.\"\n\nMeanwhile, leaders of the United Auto Workers union, which tends to support Democratic politicians and endorsed former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 general election, voiced their support for the auto tariffs.\n\n\"We applaud the Trump administration for stepping up to end the free trade disaster that has devastated working class communities for decades,\" UAW President Shawn Fain said in a statement. \"Ending the race to the bottom in the auto industry starts with fixing our broken trade deals, and the Trump administration has made history with today's actions.\"\n\nTRUMP ANNOUNCES NEW 25% TARIFFS ON AUTO IMPORTS\n\n\"The UAW has been clear: we will work with any politician, regardless of party, who is willing to reverse decades of working-class people going backwards in the most profitable times in our nation's history,\" Fain added. \"These tariffs are a major step in the right direction for autoworkers and blue-collar communities across the country.\"\n\nThe auto tariffs will go into effect Wednesday, and Trump said the federal government would start collecting fees Thursday."

      "text": "The 2028 Democratic presidential field begins to take shape at a low point for the party\n\nSAN FRANCISCO - Democrats know they need to escape political purgatory. Finding a leader to steer the way is the party's most daunting challenge after President Donald Trump won a second, nonconsecutive term.\n\nAmbitious Democrats are positioning themselves to seek their party's 2028 presidential nomination. By then, Trump will be winding down his cumulative eight years in office. The open-seat White House race, combined with current Republican congressional majorities, is forcing Democrats to define what they stand for and sell voters on their vision, such as it is.\n\nThat will be a serious slog over the next three-plus years, with the Democratic brand in poor shape.  A CNN poll released on March 16 found the Democratic Party's favorability rating stood at just 29% - a record low in CNN's polling dating back to 1992 and a drop of 20 points since January 2021. Meanwhile, the Republican Party's rating stands at 36%.\n\nThe decline comes as Democrats' ideological wings fight over the best tactics to counter Trump, which, combined with raw political ambition, makes the emerging Democratic 2028 field a wide-open electoral canvass.\n\nRepublicans, too, will choose a new nominee in 2028. The putative GOP field will get a good look-over shortly.\n\nFor now, here are some of the notable would-be Democratic candidates eyeing 2028 bids. With the usual caveat that lots can change in politics and the list could, and almost certainly will, shift dramatically the deeper Trump's second administration goes. The field is highly fluid, and a dozen or more White House aspirants could still join the presidential primary fight, while those mentioned prominently for some time might demur and stay out.\n\nA scion of Kentucky Democratic royalty - whatever that's worth in a deep red state - Beshear, 47, is building up a national political identity as a can-do problem-solver with an upper-South drawl.\n\nThe son of former Gov. Steve Beshear won the Kentucky governorship in 2019 and, in his first term, kept a low profile nationally. Andy Beshear's only national media appearances usually came in response to pleas for federal aid after tornadoes, floods, and other natural disasters hit Kentucky.\n\nBeshear, after winning reelection in 2023, has assumed a broader national profile. He was a prominent surrogate for 2024 Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris. The then-vice president's loss has propelled Beshear to at least a mid-level position in 2028 chatter.\n\nBeshear's positions on issues are standard Democratic, but as governor in strongly Republican Kentucky, he was careful at home to mostly keep mum because GOP supermajorities in the state legislature could override his vetoes almost any time. But he's now openly critical of Trump administration efforts to slash federal government agencies and programs.\n\nThe one-time South Bend, Indiana, mayor and 2020 presidential candidate announced on March 13 that he would not run for an open Senate seat in his adopted state of Michigan. Buttigieg's demurral from the Senate race opens the door to a 2028 bid for the Democratic presidential nod. Buttigieg, if his party's 2028 standard-bearer, would be the nation's first gay major-party presidential nominee.\n\nButtigieg, a member of former President Joe Biden's Cabinet from 2017-21, in a Substack post explaining his choice not to launch a Senate bid, made clear he's already working on what amounts to a possible presidential campaign theme. Buttigieg, pointing to his record as transportation secretary, said he lived \"within short driving distance of several transportation construction projects that count among the tens of thousands now being built with funds from the infrastructure package that I spent most of the last few years working on.\"\n\nButtigieg, 43, largely acquitted himself well in his 2020 Democratic presidential nomination bid. Whether the multilingual, piano-playing Harvard alumnus and Rhodes Scholar's sort of technocratic expertise is what Democrats want in 2028 is an open question. Many left-wing activists are pushing for a more performative brand of politics to blunt Trump and his MAGA supporters.\n\nHowever, Buttigieg is showing signs of a willingness to throw expletive-laced political heat. Buttigieg, when asked on March 24 about U.S. officials sharing war plans with a journalist in a group chat, \"From an operational security perspective, this is the highest level of f***-up imaginable. These people cannot keep America safe.\"\n\nBooker, 55, was a force in national politics even before winning an October 2013 special election to the Senate. For seven years before that, he attracted bountiful media coverage as mayor of Newark, leading New Jersey's largest municipality in urban challenges such as rising crime and drug sales.\n\nBooker ran for president in the 2020 presidential cycle, but he quickly flamed out, quitting in early 2020, even before early voting primaries and caucuses. He failed to gain traction despite hopeful, forward-looking messages about, in his view, the positive role the government can play in people's lives.\n\nIt's unclear whether a 2028 presidential bid would play out differently. Of course, politics is unpredictable, and his message could, in theory, have more resonance with Democratic primary voters this time around.\n\nTo the degree there are presidential campaign \"lanes\" anymore, Cooper would seem to cover similar ground as Beshear in Kentucky - that is a sober, Southern centrist profile whose public policy positions largely fall in line with mainstream, relatively centrist Democrats.\n\nCooper, 67, first has to decide whether to pursue a 2026 challenge against Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), a possible clash-of-the-titans matchup in North Carolina politics. Cooper, like other prospective 2028 presidential candidates, couldn't plausibly win a new statewide office and then turn around to launch a national campaign.\n\nCooper isn't in a hurry to decide on his political future. The longtime state attorney general-turned-governor began an eight-week fellowship at Harvard University's public health school in late March.\n\nWhen obituaries are written decades from now for the vigorous Emanuel, any one of his previous jobs could be in an opening sentence. He was a top adviser to former President Bill Clinton for six years, then a House member from Illinois, rising to join the Democratic leadership. Emanuel then was former President Barack Obama's first chief of staff, followed by eight years as mayor of Chicago. He was most recently the U.S. ambassador to Japan, with lucrative stints in between as a private equity deal broker.\n\nNow, Emanuel is eyeing a 2028 presidential run. Since returning from Tokyo just before Trump took office, Emanuel, 65, has been rebuilding his public profile. He's a Washington Post columnist and CNN contributor.\n\nEmanuel would bring to the 2028 field a keen understanding of how to win votes beyond the fervent Democratic left-wing base. That's what he did leading the House Democrats' campaign arm in 2006, when the party won a majority in the chamber for the first time in 12 years. A key part of that strategy was recruiting centrist, even conservative-leaning Democratic candidates in districts where social justice warriors wouldn't play well.\n\nEmanuel says Democrats need to go centrist if they have any hope of winning national elections again.\n\n\"The public has seen us as more focused around a set of cultural interests and issues - climate, 'woke,' DEI, abortion - than the American people,\" Emanuel recently told Axios . \"All those I care about. But they consumed both our intellectual and thematic energy. The American people said, 'You care more about that than everything else.'\"\n\nGallego just arrived in the Senate after winning a bruising 2024 open-seat race. He's showing serious political chops that were clear during his 10-year House career, now on a larger political stage.\n\nGallego, 45, joined Congress a decade ago as a vocal progressive with an impressive background. He's a first-generation American who went to Harvard, with Marine Corps service in Iraq.\n\nDuring Trump's first term, Gallego often offered scorching condemnation of his actions and administration priorities. As one of 100 senators, though, Gallego is taking a more nuanced approach. In January, he threw his support behind the Laken Riley Act. That lent crucial legislative momentum to the GOP-authored immigration bill that would force the incarceration of many undocumented immigrants accused of crimes.\n\nGallego argues Democrats need to improve their understanding of what motivates Latino voters in his state, and more broadly across the country, on border security and immigration issues. At a time when Democrats, at least those who want to win again, are doing some major soul-searching on what went wrong in 2024, Gallego argues his approach could help them find their way out of the political wilderness.\n\nKhanna has long been one of the more enigmatic members of Congress. He represents California's 17th Congressional District in the northwestern San Jose area, which includes a slice of Silicon Valley and where several top tech companies are based. The district's median income is $147,671, second out of 435 that make up the House, per the Census Bureau. Yet Khanna, a graduate of the University of Chicago and Yale Law School and a wealthy tech industry veteran himself, is a dyed-in-the-wool progressive who backed the 2020 Democratic presidential primary bid of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT).\n\nKhanna is reaching out to Democratic factions across the relative political spectrum. He's a vocal critic of Trump but not his voters. Khanna, of late, is trying to show how, in his view, the Trump administration's federal budget cuts would hurt working people.\n\nKhanna, 48, recently held town halls in the California districts of three House Republican colleagues. The son of Indian immigration painted a grim portrait of a Department of Government Efficiency wrecking ball through the federal government. Khanna further warned against the Trump administration's efforts to cut Medicaid and Social Security.\n\nThe rhetoric could foment a popular backlash that gives Democrats some political momentum heading into the 2026 midterm elections and then the 2028 presidential election. Still, Khanna faces daunting odds in a national campaign because leaping from the House directly to the presidency hasn't happened since the 1880 election.\n\nDemocrats generally aren't very kind to their former, losing presidential nominees. Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis, 1980s-era landslide losers, could barely show their faces at Democratic National Conventions for years.\n\nHarris, 60, may fall into a different category. Due to her truncated 100-day campaign after then-President Joe Biden dropped out, Harris can deflect at least some of the blame for losing all seven swing states, arguing she inherited Biden's creaky campaign apparatus.\n\nThat's the most charitable view of Harris's losing bid against Trump. Many others contend she just wasn't a very good candidate.\n\nCritics largely point to her hypercaution in public appearances. While Harris famously didn't appear on Joe Rogan's huge-audience podcast, as Trump did, she also skipped many other, more conventional media interview invitations. Harris seemed so concerned about making unforced errors in journalist interactions that many voters simply didn't know what she stood for.\n\nHarris has one political decision looming: whether to run for the California governorship. She would likely win. The field now is dominated by her fellow Democrats, mostly in statewide and legislative offices. Still, victory is no sure thing. And anyway, Harris would have to decide if she could stomach being one of 50 governors, albeit in the nation's most populous state, after previously spending four years a heartbeat away from the presidency.\n\nWith Democrats split about picking their battles against the second Trump administration or waging all-out political warfare, Murphy falls squarely in the latter campaign. Within weeks of Trump's inauguration, Murphy described the return president's tenure so far as a \"red alert\" for democracy and a \"constitutional crisis.\"\n\nMurphy, 51, a former state legislator and six-year House member before winning his Senate seat in 2012, rose to national prominence as a gun safety advocate after the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut.\n\nMany Democrats are looking for the kind of aggressive approach Murphy has to offer. But he could also upset a portion of the Democratic base with his long-running criticism of Israel. While the progressive Left has made the Jewish state and the Middle East's only democracy an international bogeyman, more centrist Democrats are still big supporters.\n\nMurphy, in November 2024, joined 18 other Senate Democrats in voting to block the further sale of U.S. weapons to Israel, needed to counter Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and other enemies of the country after the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks, which claimed about 1,200 Israeli lives. Dozens of Israeli hostages are still being held captive by Hamas terrorists in the Gaza Strip. Yet Murphy instead directed his anger at Israel, citing what he called the mounting number of civilian casualties and questions over the remaining objectives of Israel's leaders.\n\nAhead of Newsom's forced departure from his Sacramento perch in January 2027 due to state term limits, he's setting himself up for a presidential bid in an unusual way.\n\nNewsom launched a podcast in March, and his early guests included a MAGA A-List of sorts. He chatted, mostly amiably, with Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, one-time Trump adviser and populist-nationalist aviator Steve Bannon, and conservative radio show host Michael Savage. The move would seem a strange way to win over liberal voters needed to capture the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination. But political victory favors the bold, and outreach to Trump voters is a sign the governor knows his party needs to broaden its appeal.\n\nIn the Kirk podcast interview, Newsom broke with many in his party on the issue of transgender women in sports. Newsom, 57, also admitted that Democrats had overly focused on how people use pronouns.\n\nThis political dexterity is already drawing criticism from would-be 2028 Democratic rivals. Beshear criticized Newsom for platforming Bannon, a 2020 election denier.\n\n\"Newsom bringing on different voices is great,\" Beshear said on March 13 while visiting a House Democratic planning retreat in northern Virginia. \"But Steve Bannon espouses hatred and anger, and even at some points violence, and I don't think we should give him oxygen on any platform ever, anywhere.\"\n\nThe billionaire chief executive is setting himself up as a key Trump administration foil. On Jan. 20, only hours after Trump's inauguration, Pritzker, 60, released a statement sharply criticizing the president's initial executive orders and predicting the Trump administration would ignore court orders.\n\nPritzker soon announced a ban on state jobs for Illinois residents who participated in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection and had been pardoned by Trump. Pritzker also has likened what he calls the Trump administration's attacks on the rule of law to the Nazis, a notable stance in its own right but particularly because Pritzker is Jewish.\n\nAfter a steady rise through state politics, Shapiro was elected governor of Pennsylvania in 2022 in a romping 15-point win over a prominent 2020 election denier. Within two years, Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee-in-waiting, strongly considered Shapiro as her running mate, though the former vice president didn't choose him as an understudy.\n\nShapiro had, by that point, built up a national political reputation, with chatter growing about whether he could one day become the first Jewish president. Shapiro, 51, in his early days as governor, issued an executive order opening state government jobs to applicants who lack bachelor's degrees. To fill the post of secretary of state, an office appointed in Pennsylvania, Shapiro tapped Al Schmidt, a Philadelphia Republican who had been targeted by Trump allies for defending the city's voting process following the 2020 election.\n\nThe 2024 Democratic vice presidential nominee is refashioning his national profile as an \"I told you so\" figure.\n\nWalz, like many Democrats in elective office, says he warned the country about the perils of a second Trump presidency. But Walz is taking it a step further, in a way he's uniquely positioned to do. Walz says he was muzzled by Harris's presidential campaign once he joined the Democratic ticket, effectively blunting the unabashed Trump-blasting rhetoric that made him a left-wing favorite to begin with.\n\n\"We, as a party, are more cautious\" in engaging the media, both mainstream and nontraditional, Walz, a one-time high school football coach, said in a recent interview. And during the 2024 campaign, he said, \"In football parlance, we were in a prevent defense to not lose when we never had anything to lose. Because I don't think we were ever ahead.\"\n\nWalz, 60, must first decide whether to seek a third term as Minnesota's governor. Winning reelection is no sure thing in a relatively closely divided state. He might be better off trying to go national.\n\nStill, the track record in recent decades of losing vice presidential nominees isn't strong. Former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina had the best bid, finishing second in the 2008 Democratic Iowa caucuses before a sex scandal soon detonated his political career.\n\nDEMOCRATIC PARTY APPROVAL RATING HITS RECORD LOW: POLL\n\nCautionary tales include the late Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, President Gerald Ford's 1976 running mate. After the Ford-Dole ticket lost that close race, the Kansan sought the 1980 Republican nomination, but he was barely an asterisk in early-voting states against future President Ronald Reagan and soon dropped out. Dole did get a measure of political redemption by winning the 1996 Republican presidential nomination, his third try for the prize, only to lose handily against Clinton in November.\n\nOn the Democratic side, the late Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut sought to be his party's 2004 standard-bearer. Lieberman was the 2000 Democratic vice presidential nominee but couldn't get off the ground when he ran in his own right, finishing a desultory fifth in the New Hampshire primary. He soon quit the race and, a couple of years later, was out of Democratic politics altogether, winning his final six-year Senate term from Connecticut as an independent over his continued Iraq War support."

      "text": "Gomez's questions about Hegseth drinking show Democrats aren't serious people\n\nDemocrats are faking outrage over the Signal group chat incident .\n\nRep. Jimmy Gomez's (D-CA) rant on Wednesday at a House Intelligence Committee hearing on global security threats is all the proof one needs. The California politician all but accused Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth of being drunk and posting the details of an airstrike in a Signal group chat. Gomez made this not-so-thinly-veiled suggestion while questioning CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard .\n\n\"The main person who was involved in this thread that a lot of people want to talk to is Secretary of Defense Hegseth, and a lot of questions were brought up regarding his drinking habits in his confirmation hearing,\" Gomez said before posing arguably a ridiculous question in congressional history to Gabbard. \"To your knowledge, do you know whether Pete Hegseth had been drinking before he leaked classified information?\"\n\nThese aren't the questions of a serious legislator concerned about vulnerabilities in national security. They are the words of an opportunistic political scoundrel looking to pounce on an embarrassing display of incompetence by the Trump administration. There was not the slightest bit of evidence that suggested Hegseth was inebriated when the chat happened. It was preposterous even to put forward such a thought. It was a dishonest insinuation predicated on Gomez's desire to seek humiliation, not facts.\n\nConsider Gomez's question to Gabbard about drinking. Gabbard and Hegseth were not in close proximity to each other. She would have no way of knowing what Hegseth would or would not have been drinking. Gomez knew this. Everybody knew this. The only reason he asked the question was to smear Hegseth and falsely portray him as a drunk. Gomez wanted Hegseth to take a public relations hit, and this was his sole intention.\n\nGomez then made another bogus accusation, accusing Hegseth of drinking while speaking to the media after a NATO conference in Europe in February. Yet, there was no evidence this was true. Once again, Gomez was baselessly attacking Hegseth. His words are part of a coordinated political effort to smear Hegseth and frame him as a drunk.\n\nRUBIO ADMITS SIGNAL GROUP CHAT DEBACLE WAS A 'BIG MISTAKE'\n\nHe then said another lie, stating that Hegseth's sobriety during the Signal chat was a question that was on the \"tops of minds of every American.\" Once again, Gomez's words were hyperbolic, hysterical, and untrue. It was on the \"tops of minds\" of every Democratic political operative and spinster but definitely not on the minds of everyone.\n\nGomez revealed his true intentions on Wednesday. The California Democrat doesn't really care about the Signal chat incident. He only cares about doing whatever he can to score as many political points as possible."

      "text": "Democrats have a new socialist rising star\n\nWhile Democrats are in the midst of an identity crisis with no real leader for the party, the first new \"rising star\" of the second Trump era is hitting the stage in New York City .\n\nZohran Mamdani, a New York assemblyman running for mayor of New York City, is the subject of the newest Democratic love affair. He has already received a standard glowing profile in the New York Times and an even more enthusiastic profile in Politico. Mamdani also has grassroots support among leftwing voters who previously backed Sen. Bernie Sanders's (I-VT) two presidential campaigns, maxing out New York City's fundraising limit of $8 million, driven by small-dollar donations.\n\nLike Bernie, Mamdani is a socialist. One of his grand affordability proposals is government-run grocery stores. Instead of decreasing taxes for residents, Mamdani would rather get an inefficient government bureaucracy into an industry with already slim profit margins, where all the losses will be thrown onto taxpayers. Mamdani also wants to increase the corporate tax rate, yet another cost that will be passed on to city residents.\n\nMamdani is a top promoter of the antisemitic \"pro-Palestine\" movement, including being arrested at a protest outside Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's (D-NY) home shortly after the Oct. 7 attacks, where Mamdani and others were calling for Israel not to respond to Palestinian terrorists murdering 1,200 civilians. Mamdani peddles claims about a fictional \"genocide\" against the Palestinians, opposed former President Joe Biden for not being tough enough on Israel, and is backed by antisemitic activist Linda Sarsour.\n\nCUOMO DOMINATES NYC MAYORAL OPPONENTS WITH $3 MILLION HAUL\n\nThis is all part of the appeal. Mamdani is as unapologetically left-wing as they come, but he has fun doing it. Politico's gushing profile details the \"humor\" and entertainment factor of Mamdani's campaign, juxtaposing the scolding progressivism of former Vice President Kamala Harris and the mainstream Democratic Party's attitude of constant misery. As such, Mamdani offers \"another path\" where Democrats don't have to move to the center to meet voters where they are. Why wouldn't Democrats and liberal media love a campaign they can use to pretend their far-left politics weren't a driving factor in Democrats' terrible election performance?\n\nMamdani is an antisemite and an adherent to a failed economic ideology that wants to bring that ideology to a city that has been in constant decline thanks to repeated left-wing failures. He is also the model that many in the Democratic Party and liberal media want to replicate at the national level, with Democrats rejecting moderation and instead masking their loony progressivism with positivity rather than the smarmy lectures that have become the core messaging of the party."

      "text": "UMich Inflation Expectations Surge Even Higher As Democrats Freak Out\n\nHaving been widely mocked - and quantitatvely denigrated by Goldman Sachs - this morning's final print for UMich consumer sentiment for March is now a must watch.\n\nAs a reminder, Goldman explained that the Michigan measure has been especially susceptible to the tariff news recently for three reasons.\n\nFirst, inflation expectations in the survey have become extremely partisan.\n\nSecond, the share of respondents in the Michigan survey who are Democrats has always been consistently higher than the share of respondents who are Republicans\n\nThird, switching from a phone-based to an online-based data collection process has led to more extreme answers on inflation expectations.\n\nThese three issues together have boosted short-term inflation expectations in the Michigan survey by about 1.3pp and long-term inflation expectations by 0.5pp since 2024Q4. In particular, the change in distribution across political parties and increased partisanship together generated an outsized 1.0pp boost to the 1-year inflation expectation in February.\n\nSo, with all that in mind, let's see what the final data looks like - did it get even crazier?\n\nThe short answer is - YES!\n\nUMich 1Yr inflation expectations rose to 5.0% (from 4.9% preliminary) while the 5-10Y expectations jumped to 4.1% (from 3.9% flash) - the highest since August 1992...\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\nThe gaping chasm of propaganda-driven fear is evident below the surface with Republicans expected 0.1% inflation while Democrats expect - wait for it - 6.5% price rises in the next year...\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\nBear in mind that Democrat's 1Yr inflation expectations are now more than 2 times higher than they were in June 2021 when inflation would actually rise to 9%. Back then the Democrats were only off by a factor of 3x.\n\nThe final March sentiment index declined to 57 from 64.7 a month earlier. The latest reading was below both the 57.9 preliminary number and the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists.\n\n\"Consumers continue to worry about the potential for pain amid ongoing economic policy developments,'' Joanne Hsu, director of the survey, said in a statement.\n\n\"Notably, two-thirds of consumers expect unemployment to rise in the year ahead, the highest reading since 2009.''\n\nThe survey showed the expectations index plunged 11.4 points, the sharpest drop since 2021, to 52.6 this month. The current conditions gauge decreased to a six-month low of 63.8.\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\nAnd the political divergence is exploding there too...\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\nLabor market expectations worsened considerably across demographic and political groups in a sign of subdued spending over the coming months, the report showed. Moreover, expectations among high-income consumers sank.\n\n\"This trend reveals a key vulnerability for consumers, given that strong labor markets and incomes have been the primary source of strength supporting consumer spending in recent years,'' Hsu said.\n\nAccording to Democrats, the US outlook has literally NEVER been worse: worse than the global financial crisis, worse than covid, worse than ever.\n\nOne thing we note is that if Democrats are so terrified about the loss of purchasing power in the next year, why (based on the slowing spending data this morning) are they not rushing out to buy any and everything they can before Trump's terrible tariff tax trashes their wealth? Unless - of course - they are just making up their UMich responses as part of the #Resistance?\n\nStarting this month, Democrats will unleash an historic spending spree as they scramble to preserve the purchasing power of their dollars ahead of what they view as runaway inflation. Unless, of course, they are just making up their UMich responses. https://t.co/k3cwmCrq3v\n\nFinally, even Fed Chair Jerome Powell largely dismissed the Michigan survey as an outlier for longer-run expectations, and other policymakers have since echoed his remarks.\n\nWhich data series do you trust?\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "Most Democrats Think Their Party Sucks, Feel \"Burned Out\": CNN Poll\n\nA new CNN poll reveals that most Democrats think their party needs major change , and that they feel \"burned out\" by politics.\n\nThe poll comes as the party faces its lowest ratings in over three decades .\n\nA 58% majority of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say that the Democratic Party needs major changes, or to be completely reformed, up from just 34% who said the same after the 2022 midterm elections, when the party retained control of the Senate but lost the House. Over that time, the share of Republicans and Republican leaners who feel the same way about the GOP has ticked downward, from 38% to 28%. -CNN\n\nJust 49% of Democratic-aligned adults say they expect their representatives in congress to be even somewhat effective at fighting the GOP, while 90% of Republican-aligned adults expect their reps to be at least somewhat effective at passing new laws that will carry out President-elect Donald Trump's agenda.\n\nMeanwhile, most adults polled (70%) describe themselves as disappointed and (64%) frustrated with the nation's political landscape, with nearly half describing themselves as 'burned out.' 40% say they're angry - rising to 52% among Democratic-aligned women. Fewer than 20% described themselves as optimistic, fired up, inspired or proud.\n\nJust 23% of registered voters say they're satisfied with the influence voters have on the political process, down from 38% last autumn, while half of all adults (48%) say they're confident that elections reflect the will of the people . According to the report, \"Confidence has undergone a partisan reversal in the wake of Trump's electoral victory, soaring from 29% in July 2023 to 67% now among Republican-aligned adults, and dipping from 59% to 39% among Democratic-aligned adults over the same period of time.\"\n\nOverall, just 33% of all Americans express a favorable view of the Democratic Party, an all-time low in CNN's polling dating back to 1992. The GOP clocks in a tick higher, with a 36% favorability rating. Four years ago, in the immediate aftermath of the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, the Democrats' rating stood at 49%, and the Republicans' at 32%. -CNN\n\n43% of GOP-aligned adults now say they feel more a part of the Republican party vs. less like a part of it, while 32% of Democrats say the same about their party .\n\n79% of Republican-aligned voters polled say they see their party as more united than divided, while 64% of Democrats say the same - however internal divisions are a top complaint for both Democrats and Republicans.\n\nDemocrats polled who say they want to see big changes say their party is out of touch or unresponsive , and that the party has not been aggressive enough in pushing back against the GOP.\n\n\"They are too nice,\" wrote one Democrat respondant from Maryland. \"Republicans will do anything to implement their goals (while) Democrats cling to 'norms.'

      "text": "Futures Slide Ahead Of PPI As Democrats Prepare To Shut Down Government\n\nUS equity futures are again lower, although well off session lows, with small caps leading and tech stocks lagging as concerns over whether Democrats will push the US into a government shutdown over the weekend added to uncertainty around the outlook for the economy. As of 8:00am, S&P futures contracts fell 0.4%, in an extremely illiquid and volatile session, after gains on Wednesday spurred by a softer-than-expected inflation print. Nasdaq futures dropped 0.5%, with most Mag7 names lower; weak earnings hit software firm Adobe and clothing retailer American Eagle in premarket trading, Intel jumped as much as 11% after the chipmaker named a new chief executive officer. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Wednesday that Democrats would not provide the necessary votes to pass the Republican plan to avert a shutdown. The yield curve is seeing yields rise in longer-dated bonds by 1-2bps. USD is flat while cmdtys are under pressure, though Ags are stronger. The market seems a bit more resilient to headline risk as macro fundamentals return to focus ahead of next week's Fed meeting. Today's macro data focus is on PPI to see if yesterday's CPI (and PCE mapping) are intact ahead of tmrw's Univ of Mich sentiment update.\n\nIn premarket trading, Intel shares jump 11% after the chipmaker named Lip-Bu Tan as its CEO. Tan is signaling that he'll stick with his predecessor Pat Gelsinger's plan to make chips for other companies, even as he vows to learn from past mistakes. On the other end, Adobe shares slumped 4.6% after the maker of software for creative professionals gave an outlook thatwas mixed relative to expectations. While analysts are generally positive, Evercore wrote that the report wasn't strong enough to change the narrative around the stock. Here are some other notable movers:\n\nThe previous day's CPI reading \"has reinvigorated belief in the declining inflation narrative,\" said Daniel Murray, CEO of EFG Asset Management in Zurich. Investors are now awaiting readings on US wholesale inflation and initial jobless claims, with price growth seen moderating to 0.3% last month.\n\nRecent weeks have seen a slew of Wall Street banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. cut their forecasts for the S&P 500, predicting a hit from the slowing economy. Yardeni Research added to that bearish chorus, noting that Trump's tariff policies have heightened the risk of stagflation. Still, some strategists think a bottom for US stocks is \"probably\" here, with JPMorgan Chase & Co. saying the worst of the correction may be over, with credit markets indicating a lower risk of a recession.\n\nMeanwhile Treasury yields shrugged off the cooler inflation data to edge higher, with investors focusing on the effect higher tariffs could have on prices in the coming months. The Federal Reserve, which meets next week, has already signaled it will take a wait-and-see approach before cutting interest rates further.\n\nEuropean equities erased a gain of 0.5%, as earlier gains in health care, consumer product and insurance stocks were promptly reversed after Trump threatened the EU with 200% tariffs on alcohol products, and as concerns about trade persist after President Donald Trump said the US would respond to the European Union's countermeasures to his tariffs on steel and aluminum. Poland's Allegro leads gains, while Deilveroo and HelloFresh fall. European truckmakers slip after US regulators signaled they would dial back emissions standards, potentially derailing purchases of new trucks. Here are the biggest movers Thursday:\n\nEarlier in the session, Asian equities fell amid a broad risk-off mood, as traders largely looked past weaker-than-expected US inflation data. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped as much as 0.5%, reversing a gain of as much as 0.6%. TSMC was the biggest drag on the gauge, with Taiwan's benchmark the region's biggest decliner as the central bank warned of currency risks from stock outflows. Sentiment turned sour as worries mounted about the health of the world's largest economy amid on-again, off-again trade policies and geopolitical tensions. The regional gauge is down about 1.8% this week. \"The general sense is that the world is not in a good place. There's uncertainty everywhere and nobody wants to put on risk,\" said Vey-Sern Ling, a managing director at Union Bancaire Privee. \"I think economic uncertainties in the US caused by Trump's policies will be a constant worry.\"\n\nIn FX, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rises 0.1%. The yen is off its best levels but still the top G-10 FX performer against the greenback. The Swedish krona is the weakest with a 0.7% drop, closely followed by the Antipodean currencies.\n\nIn rates, treasuries dip ahead of US producer price data, with US 10-year yields rising ~2 bp to 4.33%; treasury futures drifted lower as US trading begins after plying narrow ranges during Asia session and London morning, lifting cash yields by 1bp-3bp across maturities and steepening the curve. US 10-year yields around 4.33% are ~2bp cheaper on the day near session high with bunds in the sector lagging by an additional 1bp. Treasury curve spreads are steeper, 2s10s by ~1.5bp day's high. Bunds have bigger losses as European stocks pare losses. This week's Treasury auction cycle concludes with $22b 30-year reopening at 1pm New York time; Wednesday's 10-year note auction stopped through by 0.5bp. WI 30-year yield at around 4.662% is ~9bp richer than February's auction result. Focal points of US session include February PPI, weekly jobless claims data and 30-year bond supply.\n\nIn commodities, oil prices decline, with WTI falling 0.5% to $67.30 a barrel. Spot gold rises $10 to around $2,944/oz with prices rising toward record highs as several banks predicted further gains for the haven asset amid the escalation in global trade tensions. Bitcoin is steady just above $83,000.\n\nThe US economic data calendar includes February PPI and jobless claims (8:30am) and 4Q household change in net worth (12pm). Fed officials are in external communications blackout ahead of March 19 policy announcement\n\nMarket Snapshot\n\nTop Overnight News\n\nA more detailed look at global markets courtesy of Newsquawk\n\nAPAC stocks were subdued as risk appetite soured despite the mostly positive handover from Wall St where sentiment was underpinned after softer-than-expected CPI data but with the upside capped as concerns lingered. ASX 200 was dragged lower by consumer stocks, energy and financials, with the consumer sector pressured as electricity bills are to jump as much as 9% in a cost-of-living blow following the energy regulator's price ruling. Nikkei 225 initially outperformed and briefly reclaimed the 37,000 level before wiping out the gains. Hang Seng and Shanghai Comp gradually deteriorated following a tepid PBoC liquidity operation and with participants unfulfilled by the lack of policy action so far by the central bank post-NPC, while reports that Hong Kong is mulling reducing thresholds for purchasing the most expensive stocks did little to spur a bid.\n\nTop Asian News\n\nEuropean bourses (STOXX 600 +0.3%) opened mostly lower, but sentiment has improved as the morning progressed to display a modestly positive picture in Europe. European sectors are mixed, and holds a slight defensive bias; Telecoms is towards the top of the pile, joined closely by Healthcare, which is propped up by Novo Nordisk (+3%); the Co. benefits from a broker upgrade at Kepler and as it bounces back from recent losses. Autos sits at the foot of the pile, with no clear driver but with tariff uncertainty still at the forefront of traders minds.\n\nTop European News\n\nFX\n\nFixed Income\n\nCommodities\n\nGeopolitics: Middle East\n\nGeopolitics: Ukraine\n\nGeopolitics: Other\n\nUS Event Calendar\n\nDB's Jim Reid concludes the overnight wrap\n\nStandby for an exciting special announcement from DB Research this morning. No its not me stepping down and spending more time with my family. That would be far too stressful and unaffordable.\n\nAhead of our exciting new announcement, the market selloff has finally begun to stabilise over the last 24 hours, with the S&P 500 (+0.49%) posting a recovery that kept it clear of correction territory for now. However the next hurdle is a potential US government shutdown this Saturday if not enough moderate Democrats vote for the Republican stopgap funding bill in the Senate ahead of the weekend. We will see if a deal can be made. The uncertainty has perhaps helped S&P (-0.57%) and Nasdaq (-0.87%) futures to give up their gains from yesterday so we will see how this story plays out.\n\nBefore this, the softer-than-expected US CPI print had dominated, reassuring investors that the Fed would still have the space to cut rates if required. But even with the weaker inflation print, the rally faded as the day progressed. There was still a lot of concern about ongoing tariffs, particularly after various retaliatory measures were announced against the United States. So that meant the S&P gave up the bulk of its initial +1.26% move straight after the open, closing at +0.49%, with nearly two thirds of S&P 500 constituents lower on the day and a lot of other risk assets still struggling to gain traction.\n\nIn terms of that CPI release, the February numbers were the mirror image of the previous month, as both headline and core CPI surprised on the downside. For instance, headline CPI fell to just +0.22% on the month (vs. +0.3% expected), which pushed the year-on-year rate down to +2.8% (vs. +2.9% expected). That monthly print was the weakest since August, and it meant the 3m annualised rate finally moved down to +4.3%, ending a run of 6 consecutive increases in the measure. Meanwhile for core CPI, there was also a decent story, with the monthly number at +0.23% (vs. +0.3% expected), which pushed the year-on-year rate down to +3.1% (vs. +3.2% expected). You can see our US economists' full CPI recap here.\n\nAs discussed, the release immediately led to a surge in US equity futures, as investors hoped it would keep the Fed on course to cut rates this year. However, that initial positivity began to tail off as the market focus returned back to tariffs, and whether that might lead to a fresh rebound in the inflation numbers. Indeed, yesterday saw Canada retaliate against the latest US steel and aluminium tariffs, announcing tariffs on around C$30bn of US products, targeting steel and aluminium as well. And that followed on from the EU's own announcement yesterday morning, who proposed countermeasures covering €26bn of American goods, which would come into force over April. So collectively, the fear is that this ratchet could be increasingly hard to climb down from over the months ahead. Amidst a visit to Ireland, Trump himself continued to make comments implying that tariffs would go up, saying that the US would respond to the EU countermeasures, that he wasn't happy with the EU and that April 2 would be a very big day, when he's planning to impose reciprocal tariffs. He also referred to Ireland's large pharmaceuticals trade surplus against the US. Remember as well that Trump has said he considers VAT to be like a tariff, so that could seriously affect a lot of European countries.\n\nWith all that in hand, the S&P 500 (+0.49%) ultimately ended the day higher, but that was mainly thanks to a strong bounceback for the Magnificent 7 (+2.27%), which put in their best daily performance in six weeks. Indeed, the recovery was a pretty narrow one, with most constituents in the S&P moving lower on the day (65%), which left the equal-weighted index down -0.46%, while the Dow Jones fell -0.20%. Small-cap stocks also lagged, with the Russell 2000 only up +0.14%. But despite the caveats, the moves took the S&P further away from the -10% threshold that would mark a technical correction, leaving it -8.87% beneath its peak, while moderating volatility saw the VIX index (-2.69pts to 24.23) post its biggest decline of the year so far.\n\nThe modest risk-on tone meant that US Treasuries struggled yesterday, despite the softer-than-expected CPI print. So yields rose across the curve, with the 2yr yield (+4.5bps) up to 3.99%, whilst the 10yr yield (+3.2bps) moved up to 4.31%, its highest level in two weeks before dipping back to 4.295% in Asia this morning. In addition, the equity recovery also helped alleviate fears that the US was heading into recession, and investors dialled back their expectations for Fed rate cuts this year, despite the softer CPI print. So by the close, the rate priced in for the December meeting had actually moved up +5.7bps on the day, with futures only pricing in 70bps of cuts this year.\n\nOver in Europe, the narrative was more consistently positive yesterday, with the STOXX 600 (+0.81%) ending a run of 4 consecutive declines, whilst the DAX saw a larger +1.56% gain. For what it's worth, that's now the 8th consecutive session where the DAX has moved by at least 1% in either direction, and if we get a 9th today, it would be the first time that's happened since the pandemic turmoil of H1 2020. Bond yields also came off their recent highs, with yields on 10yr bunds (-1.9bps), OATs (-3.4bps) and BTPs (-2.3bps) all moving lower. And there was a fresh tightening in sovereign bond spreads too, with the Franco-German 10yr spread down to 67.6bps, which is the tightest it's been since July. Today sees a debate in the reconvened outgoing Bundestag which kicks off the constitutional process leading us to potentially see the largest domestic fiscal stimulus since at least German reunification. See our economists' note \"Crunchtime in the Bundestag\" previewing this.\n\nOtherwise yesterday, the Bank of Canada delivered a 25bp rate cut in their latest policy decision, taking their overnight rate down to 2.75%, in line with expectations. Their statement acknowledged the ongoing trade war, saying that \"heightened trade tensions and tariffs imposed by the United States will likely slow the pace of economic activity and increase inflationary pressures in Canada.\" The Canadian dollar strengthened by +0.45% against the US Dollar yesterday, making it the strongest-performing G10 currency, and the statement acknowledged that they would need to assess \"the timing and strength of both the downward pressures on inflation from a weaker economy and the upward pressures on inflation from higher costs.\"\n\nAsian equity markets are lower overnight with the Hang Seng (-1.42%) leading losses and heading for its fifth successive loss while the CSI (-0.58%) and the Shanghai Composite (-0.75%) are also trading lower alongside the KOSPI (-0.38%) and the S&P/ASX 200 (-0.48%). The Nikkei (+0.07%) is clinging on to gains after a larger earlier rally.\n\nTo the day ahead now, and US data releases include PPI inflation for February and the weekly initial jobless claims. Meanwhile in the Euro Area, we'll get industrial production for January. Otherwise, central bank speakers include ECB Vice President de Guindos, and the ECB's Rehn, Vujcic, Makhlouf, Holzmann, Villeroy and Nagel.\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

Adam Schiff and Chuck Schumer digging in against it and pushing for a 30-day funding stopgap instead so they can renegotiate the larger stopgap.\n\nAccording to Axios , Senate Democrats left a private meeting on Wednesday saying there aren't enough votes to advance the bill, raising the chances of a government shutdown this weekend.\n\nAnd according to Semafor , Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer - while privately counseling his caucus for weeks that a shutdown would be bad politics for Democrats - is now telling them to push for an 'alternate' stopgap, Semafor reports further.\n\nTo that end, Senate Democrats are now pushing for a 30-day funding package that would give bipartisan negotiators more time to reach a deal.\n\n\" Republicans chose a partisan path , drafting their continuing resolution without any input, any input from congressional Democrats.

So far only one - Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania - has indicated he'll support it. Other key swing voters are on the fence.\n\nSen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) told reporters Wednesday that he remains undecided on the seven-month funding bill, which passed the House mostly along party lines Tuesday. Asked when he would make a decision, he quipped he'd make up his mind before the end of the Senate vote on the bill, which hasn't yet been scheduled.\n\nMeanwhile, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) is a 'no' on the bill.\n\nMeanwhile, Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA) threw a tantrum over the bill, saying in a Wednesday statement \"I will not be voting for the partisan bill coming before the Senate that will further cement the Trump Administration's chaos and reckless actions that are hurting working families and our economy.\"\n\nWill Democrats risk taking the blame for a government shutdown? Looks like it.\n\n\"I do not want to shut down our government, I want to improve it, streamline it and ensure it delivers services our communities need,\" said Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE), while Rep.

Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) - who is retiring at the end of her term, and Angus King (Maine). Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), as expected, voted no.\n\nThe bill will now move to President Donald Trump's desk, who will have to sign it before midnight to avert a shutdown.

Rand Paul (R-KY) voting no, at least eight Democrats needed to join the other 52 Republicans in addition to Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY).\n\nThose who joined R's included; Durbin, King, Schatz, Cortez Masto, Hassan, Peters, Gillibrand and Fetterman...

John Fetterman (D-PA) who's a 'yes' as well.\n\nAs it stands, the Senate will vote this afternoon to overcome a filibuster of the House's continuing resolution, which funds federal agencies through Sept. 30 at current 2024 levels, but also includes approximately $13 billion in cuts to nondefense programs, and $6 billion in additional military spending. It's unclear what time the vote will occur, as both sides are working to secure an agreement to allow senators to finish before the midnight shutdown deadline and head home for a weeklong recess.\n\nSchumer claims he has no choice, saying that a shutdown would be a \"gift\" to the Trump administration, and \"the best distraction he could ask for from his awful agenda.\"\n\n\"It is deeply partisan. It doesn't address far too many of this country's needs. But I believe allowing Donald Trump to take even much more power via a government shutdown is a far worse option,\" he said Thursday on the Senate floor.\n\nOn Thursday night, Schumer went on MSNBC to pretend he was outraged, but just had to pass the bill (and call Republicans 'bastards.')\n\n🚨DESPERATE CHUCK SCHUMER CALLS REPUBLICANS \"BASTARDS\"🚨 \"It's much, much better not to be in the middle of a shutdown, which would divert people from the number one issue we have against these bastards!\" \"They're ruining democracy!\" pic.twitter.com/9i90rfOv9z\n\n\"It's much, much better not to be in the middle of a shutdown, which should divert people from the number one issue we have against these bastards, sorry, these people , which is not only all these cuts, but they're ruining democracy,\" he said.\n\nPresident Trump congratulated Schumer, posting to Truth Social :\n\nCongratulations to Chuck Schumer for doing the right thing - Took \"guts\" and courage! The big Tax Cuts, L.A. fire fix, Debt Ceiling Bill, and so much more, is coming. We should all work together on that very dangerous situation. A non pass would be a Country destroyer, approval will lead us to new heights. Again, really good and smart move by Senator Schumer. This could lead to something big for the USA, a whole new direction and beginning! DJT\n\nHouse Democrats huddled at their annual strategy retreat in Northern Virginia on Thursday, where they bombarded their Senate colleagues with calls and texts urging them to nuke the GOP bill.\n\nThat said, Democrats didn't have the cards...\n\nLet's be blunt here: Democrats picked a fight they couldn't win and caved without getting anything in return. - Punchbowl\n\nHouse Democrats also oppose the spending cuts contained in the GOP bill, warning that they will erode critical public services (grifts), and that fact that the GOP bill excludes specific language to limit what Elon Musk and DOGE can do as the Trump administration continues to slash federal agencies and programs unchecked by Congress, The Hill reports.\n\nBut Schumer rejected their demands.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (a performance artist herself) led the charge against Senate Democrats, after House Democrats united against the GOP bill in the lower chamber.\n\n\"There is a deep sense of outrage and betrayal,\" said AOC. \"And this is not just about progressive Democrats, This is across the board - the entire party.\"\n\n\"Just to see Senate Democrats even consider acquiescing Elon Musk - I think it is a huge slap in the face,\" she continued.\n\n\"It's an awful decision,\" said Rep. Joseph Morelle (D-NY) . \"People are angry. We were almost to a person in unison [on the House vote]. ... And a significant percentage of their caucus is voting to allow the Republicans to do whatever they want to do.\"\n\n*  *  *\n\n\"Right now, they are openly saying that they will take this money that is in this bill and then they will just appropriate it for whatever they want,\" said Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA).\n\n\"People have to know what Democrats stand up for, and they've got to see us fighting for them,\" she added. \"And if we're just the same, and we're just going to enable Republicans to do what they're doing, I think that's obviously why people are frustrated.\"\n\nRep. Greg Casar (D-TX) - head of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said that the GOP bill is specifically designed to let Trump and Musk keep 'plundering.'\n\n\"First and foremost, Senate Republicans should back down from screwing over their own constituents,\" he said. \"And then second, Senate Democrats should do the same thing House Democrats did, which is fight for our constituents and block this bill.\"\n\n\" Democrats were elected to fight for working people, not put up a fake fight. \"\n\nSpeaking of fake fights...\n\nRep. Thomas Massie says it's all an act... a \"fake fight\" in the House that \"will become obvious when the Senate Democrats vote for this stinker.\"\n\nThe low down on this CR. It's a fake fight here in the House that will become obvious when the Senate Democrats vote for this stinker. pic.twitter.com/MPD9quy2aN\n\nAs Punchbowl notes in its post-mortem...\n\nThere's a reason Republicans put Democrats in this position - because they know Democrats would eventually cave. And they did.\n\nDuring this whole fight, Democrats never managed to put Speaker Mike Johnson, Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Trump in a tough spot. There are plenty of policies House Democrats could've asked for in the CR - more money for certain programs, for instance - that would've placed Republicans in a bind. But they never made the case publicly for anything like that.\n\nSenate Democrats, meanwhile, essentially tried to have it both ways. They spent the last few days - which included three long and contentious lunch meetings - warning each other in private about the grave dangers of forcing a government shutdown. But in front of TV cameras, they were trashing the House GOP CR and insisting they wouldn't vote for the funding measure. This won them praise from progressives, activist groups and House Democrats.\n\nSchumer, who didn't take a public position until last night, fired a warning shot on Wednesday when he said Republicans didn't have enough Democratic votes to pass the CR, basically threatening a filibuster. In the meantime, Senate Democrats pushed for a short-term CR intended to buy time for a bipartisan funding deal that was never going anywhere.\n\nThis set up the Democratic base for disappointment for seemingly no reason.\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "Senate Democrats Consider Support For RFK Jr. As Health Secretary Amid Controversy\n\nAs the Biden administration gears up for the confirmation hearings of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for the role of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary, a surprising development has occurred within the Senate. Despite considerable backlash from many in the Democratic Party due to Kennedy's controversial views on vaccinations, a few Senate Democrats are reportedly keeping an open mind about voting for him.\n\nSenators Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and John Fetterman (D-PA) may throw support behind Kennedy , according to The Hill . They share Kennedy's criticisms of heavy corporate influence over the food industry and advocate for a shift towards less chemical-laden approaches in America . This openness aligns with their ongoing efforts to address the shortcomings in the U.S. food system, despite the contentious nature of Kennedy's nomination.\n\n\" I think Bernie will give him a fair review ,\" said one source close to the Senator's office. \"I definitely think his Senate office will use the opportunity to point out the shortcomings of the industrial food system, supply chains, etc.,\" the source continued. \"I think they've been doing a little of that already.\"\n\nTheir perceived openness comes despite a fervent backlash against Kennedy's nomination from many within the Democratic Party, where his controversial stances on vaccinations still could be a deciding factor for many who see his views as dangerous for public health. -The Hill\n\nKennedy's efforts to be confirmed involve reaching out to Republican senators as well , from whom he needs a substantial majority to secure his position, given the potential lack of unanimous Democratic support. His meetings on Capitol Hill and public calls for support are part of a strategic push to showcase his health agenda , which focuses heavily on reforming food industry practices and promoting healthier lifestyles.\n\nThe nomination has placed Democrats in a difficult position. Many spent the last election distancing themselves from Kennedy after his switch from the Independent party, wary of his ability to draw third-party support that could impact general election outcomes. His nomination by Trump has forced them to reassess their stance, especially as Kennedy reemerges in the political spotlight.\n\nDespite some Democrats' willingness to consider Kennedy's nomination, others remain staunchly opposed. Senators like Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and potential concerns from other liberal members reflect the deep divisions within the party regarding Kennedy's fitness for the role, especially concerning his vaccine views.\n\nSenator Chuck Schumer (D-NY), has publicly criticized efforts associated with Kennedy's nomination, particularly around vaccines - calling it \"outrageous and dangerous for people in the Trump Transition to try and get rid of the polio vaccine\" in a post last month to X.\n\nKennedy recently visited Capitol Hill to discuss his health agenda - which he telegraphed would be central to his approach at HHS. While there, he met with Republican Sens. John Barrasso (WY), Shelley Moore Capito (W. VA.), and Marsha Blackburn (TN). That said, he'll have slightly more breathing room if he can convince even one Democrat to vote for him.\n\n\"I am no expert on Fetterman, but my sense is that he and [Sanders] will vote for RFK,\" said progressive Nina Turner, a former congressional candidate who's close to Sanders.\n\nFetterman had previously talked shit about Kennedy, however, saying in November, \"I'm not going to really take any kind of advice [from] a dude that chainsaws whale heads and delivers dead bears into a park.\"\n\nThat said, the Pennsylvania politician may be open after all.\n\n\"Fetterman has impressed me with his willingness to meet with Trump's nominees without the normal partisan spin and insults attached to the process,\" one pro-Kennedy source told the outlet. \"To me, he's signaling to MAGA that he's open to working together on areas that can benefit the people and help everyday people.\"\n\n\"Fetterman,\" the source added, is \"definitely a swing vote for all of Trump's nominees.\"\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "\"Taking Away Everything We Have\": Democrats & Unions Launch An Existential Fight Over Buyouts\n\nAuthored by Jonathan Turley,\n\nThomas Paine once remarked, \"Government, even in its best state, is but a necessary evil; in its worst state, an intolerable one.\" With the approaching 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, much has clearly changed.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's move to reduce government is now portrayed as evil in its own right. Elon Musk's move to draw down various agencies was presented as a virtual return to the state of nature.\n\nDemocratic members staged protests in front of various agencies to declare \" war \" and to accuse Trump of \"destroying the government\" by shrinking it. Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D., Md.) declared \"Every time you hear DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency, you just remember it is the department of government evil.\"\n\nThe coordinated efforts of Democratic leaders and the mainstream media have once again not resonated with the public. Trump, according to polls , is now at higher popularity levels than during his first term. And a strong majority of Americans say Trump is keeping his promises, including in his efforts to reduce government spending and waste.\n\nThose efforts include a generous buyout offer for federal employees . The Trump administration offered federal workers the chance to stay home for months while receiving full pay if they would agree to resign from government employment.\n\nIt was an extremely clever move. The best way to shrink the government is to get people to leave voluntarily. But Trump and Musk also have warned that layoffs will follow if not enough federal workers accepted the buyout.\n\nIt is a type of self-deportation from government service. And it worked, with about 75,000 federal workers accepting Trump's offer before the deal ended Wednesday.\n\nIt worked so well, in fact, that Democrats rushed to stop the voluntary exodus by falsely suggesting that it was a scam. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., warned employees that Trump would \" stiff you ,\" even though the offer comes with the authority of the federal government.\n\nHis colleague, Mark Warner (D, Va.) added ominously for workers to \"Think twice. Has this individual in his business world ever fulfilled his contracts or obligations to any workers in the past?\"\n\nAt the same time, unions (looking at a major reduction of force) have filed with Democratic groups to stop these employees from taking the offer. They found a favorable court with U.S. District Court Judge George O'Toole who enjoined the program. However, after citywide celebrations over the injunction, the court then lifted the injunction on the buyout program , agreeing to allow the buyouts to go forward.\n\nUnions representing federal workers and liberal legal organizations are likely to now appeal O'Toole's decision. The unions, which are facing a major reduction in dues-paying members, have a disturbing conflict of interest in trying to deny federal workers the benefits of an offer they chose to accept.\n\nThe legal challenges to the buyout have relied on a plethora of arguments asserting that a president cannot allow employees to stay home and receive pay pending their departure from federal employment. Those arguments cited the Antideficiency Act , which bars agencies from spending beyond the money appropriated by Congress.\n\nThe counterargument is that money used for the buyouts was allocated to pay employees whose service normally continues year after year. Under Article II of the Constitution , the president is given ample discretion in running the executive branch, including the work status of federal employees.\n\nCongress clearly has a role in controlling use of the federal purse. For example, Congress can determine whether to allocate money to build certain Navy vessels. However, once the ships are built, it is the president who decides where to send them and who will serve on the crew. The commander in chief also can expand or shrink the size of the crew.\n\nTrump was well within his authority in offering to change employees' duties while they look for new positions, and the employees had every right to agree to eight months of paid leave in exchange for their resignation from government service.\n\nThe opposition from Democrats and labor unions is the ultimate form of paternalism. In the name of protecting employees, opponents fought to prevent workers from accepting offers they believe are best for themselves and their families.\n\nFederal employees are entitled to protections in their employment. But they're not entitled to permanent employment. Congress is entitled to appropriate money for specific purposes. But it is not entitled to manage the executive branch.\n\nTrump is very willing to fight on this hill. He holds a strong constitutional position and an even stronger political position.\n\nFor those who proclaimed themselves as defenders of democracy throughout last year's election cycle, this is what democracy looks like. Voters made clear that they want changes in the size and the focus of government.\n\nThose voters are unlikely to be convinced by the warning of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., that Musk is \" taking away everything we have .\"\n\nThat is precisely what Americans asked for in reelecting Donald Trump.\n\n*  *  *\n\nJonathan Turley is the Shapiro professor of public interest law at George Washington University and the author of \" The Indispensable Right: Free Speech in an Age of Rage .\"\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

But this is a case where a lot of people need to resign in disgrace. Party needs a complete reboot. They continue to double down on all of the mistakes and policies that were made before.\"\n\n\"If I were a member of the Democratic Party, the leadership, I would be saying we love this effort to eliminate waste, fraud and abuse in our government.

I'm kind of bearish on Europe, \" the hedge fund manager recently told CNBC. \"And I think they need to make some fairly dramatic changes politically and otherwise.

      "text": "Democrat 'Fight' Mantra Masks a Passive Response to Defeat The party of \"change\" flaunts its inflexibility.\n\n\"F ight,\" which liberals found so distasteful when shouted by Donald Trump right after he survived an assassination attempt, now acts as the constant progressive watchword.\n\nPramila Jayapal, in a short interview with the Nation , used it five times. Philip Bump, as though conveying marching orders, wrote an article in the Washington Post titled: \"Voters love a fighter. So why won't the Democratic Party fight?\" A town hall crowd in Stratham, New Hampshire, urged Democratic Representative Chris Pappas to \"fight, fight, fight.\" (RELATED: Democrats Embarrass Themselves Imitating Trump )\n\nDoes Donald Trump receive residuals for that?\n\nThe truth about \"fight\" is that it tells a lie. Ostensibly, it indicates an active, aggressive tact. In reality, it indicates passivity.\n\nDemocrats lost badly in 2024. An active response to that defeat would include a change in the policies that resulted in voter turn-off. Instead, Democrats turtled up and went passive. They refuse to alter their policy stances. This means Democrats submissively wait until the other party screws up so badly (or voter familiarity eventually breeds contempt for Republicans) that the electorate finally gives them another shot. They do nothing to affect the desired outcome. (RELATED: The Democratic Party Is Collapsing )\n\nDemocrats have not reoriented their course at all on issues since the election.\n\nTake transgender men competing in women's sports. According to a New York Times poll, four in five respondents oppose this. Among Democrats, two in three oppose. Rather than conform to political reality, Senate Democrats earlier this month unanimously blocked a bill that sought to ban biological males from competing in women's sports.\n\nRather than acknowledge that waste, fraud, and corruption exist in government, and form an alliance with Elon Musk on parts of the budget (defense?) that Democrats want cut, progressives instead exhibited a kneejerk hostility to the Department of Government Efficiency's mission from Day One.\n\nThe Laken Riley Act, a political no-brainer, received support from just 12 Democrats in the U.S. Senate.\n\nAfter 10 senators on the left side of the aisle voted to advance a vote on keeping the government open, one Democrat in the Senate, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, and an independent, Angus King, who caucuses with the Democrats, voted for the final bill to keep the government open . Government, typically presented as the alpha and omega to solving our problems by Democrats, they voted to shut down. Hmmm.\n\nAn alternative template for regaining power exists. In 1992, Bill Clinton ran as a \"New Democrat.\" He supported the death penalty, free trade, and welfare reform. He presided over a balanced budget. On several occasions, he stood up to the party's left wing. Ask Gerry Brown and Sister Souljah.\n\nThe most important thing he did? He won. After looking from the outside of the White House for 20 of the previous 24 years, Democrats regained the presidency in 1992.\n\nSometimes it takes that long of a political exile for a party to get smart. After eight years of GOP banishment from the Oval Office, Donald Trump engineered major shifts in the Republican vision on trade, immigration, and foreign policy. This proved a winning formula.\n\nIronically, the party of \"change\" operates as a rigid, sclerotic clique afraid to question any of its shopworn ideas. At the same time, Democrats demand that everyone embrace such massive changes as calling men women and turning us all into immigrants in the country of our birth by opening the borders.\n\nIn that interview, Jayapal insisted that \"we have to actually redo this system, because it's rigged. The Democratic Party is rigged against itself, but Jayapal and friends refuse to redo it.\n\nInflexible ideologues unable to even tweak their own platforms should understand the difficulty of convincing the rest of society to turn itself on its head. But they don't. They're inflexible ideologues, after all.\n\nAnd that's why they lose.\n\nREAD MORE from Daniel J.

      "text": "Democrats' Civil War Over Transgenderism Heats Up Rahm Emanuel is just the latest Democrat to defect over the issue.\n\nO ne by one, Democrats are deciding that the jig is up and it's time to join the side of the American people on transgenderism.\n\nMassachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton said he doesn't want to see his young daughters \"getting run over\" by a male athlete. California Gov. Gavin Newsom said that it is \"deeply unfair\" to have male athletes in women's sports. (RELATED: Is the Transgender Movement Really Backing Down? )\n\nAnd now, we also have Rahm Emanuel. The former ambassador to Japan and mayor of Chicago broke from transgender orthodoxy in perhaps the most blustery way possible. \"Look,\" he said , \"in seventh grade, if I had known that I could have said the word 'they' and got in the girls' bathroom, I would have done it.\"\n\nThose comments, which he made on the anti-woke-but-left-leaning Real Time With Bill Maher , followed earlier comments he made in which he said Democrats should be focused on improving educational outcomes rather than on bathrooms and locker rooms. (RELATED: Dissatisfied Democrats Voice Frustrations With Party Line on Transgender Issues )\n\nRahm Emanuel's break from transgender orthodoxy is particularly notable for its boldness. He isn't just walking back the idea of allowing biological boys in girls' locker rooms, he is - through humor - questioning the whole ideology.\n\nAccording to Politico 's Jonathan Martin, this is all part of an effort to set up a run for the presidency. Martin posited that Emanuel's biggest liability in such an endeavor would be that he \"reeks of yesterday.\" But by bucking the Democratic consensus on unpopular areas with provocative and headline-making comments, Emanuel is hoping that he can break from the pack and distinguish himself as a leader of the party's new direction. (RELATED: Five Quick Things: Welcome to the Briar Patch, Chuck Schumer )\n\nIndeed, Emanuel has sought to push toward the center in a number of other ways in recent weeks, including on urban crime. He told Maher: \"We've gone through five years where people became way too permissive as a culture - which is why everything is locked up at CVS and Walgreens, and that's a disaster.\"\n\nMeanwhile, most of the Democratic Party is still tied in a knot over transgenderism, and they are too afraid to break free. This includes Maine Gov. Janet Mills, who recently doubled down on keeping men in women's sports, and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who recently pledged to veto a bill that would nullify his executive order banning children from receiving therapy to help them accept their biological sex.\n\nFor years, Democrats have proclaimed that it is bigoted for anyone or any law to treat someone who identifies as transgender as anything less than a full and complete member of their opposite biological sex. Yet public opinion has shifted, with Americans now opposing the presence of men in women's bathrooms, locker rooms, prisons, and sports teams. (Nearly 80 percent of Americans oppose allowing men in women's sports, according to a recent New York Times poll.)\n\nIf Democrats back down, they will be endorsing actions they condemned as bigoted just months ago. They will also be crossing a big red line in the Democrats' unofficial moral code by refuting the notion that transgender identities should be \"affirmed\" in every way by society.\n\nLet's step back and consider how Democrats got into this kerfuffle. The primary reason is that they have become stuck in the clutches of progressive advocacy organizations, think tanks, policy institutes, and lobbying groups.\n\nA January tell-all by Vanity Fair on the collapse of the Democratic Party termed these organizations simply \"the groups.\" Many on the center-left, the essay asserted, believe \"the groups\" are \"the reason why Democrats are now so nervous about breaking even slightly with the consensus of the party.\" (RELATED: The Democratic Party Is Collapsing )\n\nAn essay in the Atlantic last month likewise laid the blame for the Democratic Party's travails at the feet of \"the groups.\" The groups, it asserted, \"have managed to amass enormous influence over the party\" even though they \"seldom have a broad base of support.\" The Atlantic essay explained that the groups do so by \"monopolizing the brand value of various causes,\" including climate change, abortion, and racial justice. This means they are able to \"define\" what the Democratic Party's policies should be on the issues, particularly through the dissemination of their ideas via progressive journalists.\n\nInterestingly, the Atlantic takes the 2020 Democratic primary as the crux of the groups' power. It explains: \"The gigantic field of candidates slogged through a series of debates and interviews in which journalists asked if they would affirm various positions demanded by the groups.\" For me, this brings to mind Planned Parenthood's 2019 \"forum on reproductive rights,\" at which 16 Democratic presidential candidates came out to parrot exactly what the abortion advocacy group wanted to hear. Likewise, the LGBTQ-focused Human Rights Campaign hosted an October 2019 event for Democratic presidential candidates at which Kamala Harris introduced herself by saying , \"My pronouns are she, her, and hers.\"\n\nThe priorities of these activist groups simply do not represent those of the Democratic Party writ large. By recognizing this and breaking from the elite consensus - as Emanuel has now done on transgenderism - Democrats could theoretically give themselves a major political boost.\n\nBut \"the groups\" still have the Democratic Party in their clutches, and defying them presents major risks.\n\nWhen Gavin Newsom came out to oppose men in women's sports, the Human Rights Campaign released a statement suggesting that his comments \"make it seem like Gov. Newsom believes our civil rights are up for grabs.\" Two members of the state legislature additionally said they were \"profoundly sickened and frustrated\" by the governor's comments.\n\nLikewise, Emanuel's comments invited a band of radicals to come forward and attack him.\n\n\"I cannot think of another Democrat more unsuited to the current political moment than Rahm Fcking Emanuel, whose only real political gift is alienating members of his party's political base,\" wrote Charles P. Pierce in Esquire .\n\nThe enduring influence of \"the groups\" can be seen in the fact that no Democrats have switched their stance on transgenderism beyond rhetoric. California continues to allow men in women's sports, keeps men in women's prisons, promises to shield children who identify as transgender from parents who oppose medical transition treatments, and bans schools from revealing a transgender identity to parents without a child's permission. Likewise, no Democrats in the House or Senate joined Republicans in voting to ban men from women's sports earlier this year. (RELATED: The Democratic Party Is Collapsing )\n\nWhat seems certain is that the first Democrat who can successfully defy this elite class of ideologues - in reality, and not just rhetoric - without losing the party's support stands a major chance of winning the nomination come 2028. Moulton, Newsom, and Emanuel are unlikely to be the only ones to try.\n\nThe Democratic presidential debate stage - which will feature candidates who choose to defy \"the groups\" and those who stick with them - is going to be fiery.\n\nREAD MORE from Ellie Gardey Holmes :\n\nMelania Trump Finds Her Stride\n\nWith IVF Executive Order, Trump Bows to Radical Liberals\n\nStarbucks Recognizes Sanity and Backs Away From DEI Policy\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "Democrats Are Looking For a New Face. Is It AOC? Democrats should be asking if she's the person they want remaking their party.\n\nI f Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez sat down with me in a debugged prison cell to assert on deep background that she has no aspirations for a prominent leadership role in the Democrat Party, I wouldn't believe her.\n\nShe's been spending the last several years developing the kind of smooth, self-assured persona that Democrats - at least since the Obama era - seem convinced wins them elections and garners the support of Americans. (Of course, she's not the only one; Gavin Newsom has that affected personality down pat.) Now, in the post-Trump conflagration of the Democrat Party, it all finally seems to be paying off.\n\nTo anyone who keeps a close eye on politics, that probably comes as something of a surprise. After all, AOC has publicly been at loggerheads with Democratic leadership. Even as recently as a year ago, she praised the \"young people\" at Yale and Columbia universities who engaged in violent antisemitic pro-Palestinian protests, even though party leaders like Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton denounced the same protests in no uncertain terms.\n\n\"I have a weird relationship with the Democratic Party. I don't believe in a two-party system, but I also understand the Democratic Party is a coalition and if we want the party to change, the balance of the coalition has to change,\" she told Latino USA during a recent podcast . \"But right now, you open the hood on the Democratic Party, what you have is, I think, a bit of a power struggle over the last couple of years.\"\n\nPower struggle. That's one way to put it. At this point, that power struggle has resulted in a destructive conflagration in the Democratic Party. In the words of Abraham Lincoln (who stole it from the Bible), \"A house divided against itself cannot stand.\" The Democrat Party is - as the last several months have amply demonstrated - no exception.\n\nThe thing about these kinds of seismic political shifts that take down parties is that when the flames finally settle down, there are usually new leaders with new ideas. AOC is angling to be one of those leaders.\n\nThat CNN poll tells us two important things about the direction of the Democratic Party. The first is that the country views the party as entirely progressive - the kind of progressive that equates to implementing green taxes that destroy American businesses and using the government to fund transgender education for preschoolers. To put it more simply, the country looks at the contingent of the party that leans the furthest left and ascribes those beliefs to the whole party.\n\nGiven the results of the latest election, that's a good thing for Republicans. That same CNN poll found that just 29 percent of Americans view the Democrat Party favorably, compared to the 54 percent who view it unfavorably. Even when the prices of imported goods go up and eggs can't be found on grocery store shelves, Americans may just hold on to the idea that it's better to have a government that embraces common sense rather than one that seeks to indoctrinate their children in ideologies that destroy both the individual and society.\n\nThe second takeaway is that Democrats have apparently not learned their lesson. Again, the CNN poll found that 57 percent of Democrats or Democrat-leaning independents thought that the role of their elected officials in Congress was to \"[w]ork to stop the Republican agenda.\" (Evidently, the fact that the majority of voters voted for the Republican agenda isn't enough to let them have it.)\n\nWe're still in the early days of the post-Trump conflagration sweeping through the Democrat Party, and it's difficult to tell who will come out on top when all is said and done. A party run by AOC is unlikely to ever garner widespread support from Americans (she is a member of Democratic Socialists of America, which advocates for an end to capitalism and private property), and she and any of her colleagues with an ounce of political smarts know that. What remains to be seen is whether the temptation to find a leader who will simply oppose Trump and the Republican agenda will be too strong.\n\nOf course, if AOC becomes the new face of the Democrat Party, that might just be the best news of the century for Republicans.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "The Democrats' Antisemitism Problem A not so simmering problem Schumer must deal with.\n\nH op in the time machine and hit the \"Way Back\" button for 1948.\n\nUpon arriving, you will find that a hot topic of the day was the founding of what would be called the State of Israel. And into the middle of that issue was, among a collection of world leaders, America's own President Harry S. Truman.\n\nTruman was a lifelong Democrat whose political career had been based in his native Missouri. He had been a county official, then won election to the United States Senate. In 1944, running for what would be his highly unusual fourth term, President Franklin Roosevelt selected Truman as his vice presidential running mate.\n\nElected, Truman was sworn in as vice president on Jan. 20, 1945.\n\nAnd then.\n\nOn April 12, 1945, FDR died suddenly of a stroke, and Truman was sworn in as the nation's new president. While the world took note, the chaos of World War II did not stop. One of the large issues the new President Truman had to face was what to do with Middle East policy and the question of the creation and official recognition of the Jewish state of Israel.\n\nIn his memoirs, Truman wrote that he was in staunch support of the creation of Israel. He added this of the opposition to the creation and recognition of Israel coming from the professional bureaucrats (aka left leaning bureaucrats) inside the State Department: \"I am sorry to say that there were some among them who were also inclined to be anti-Semitic.\"\n\nWhat could not be known at the time was that this antisemitic streak that Truman had to deal with would stretch well down the road into the 21st century Democrat Party.\n\nIn 2008, a full 60 years later, NPR reported this of the Democratic National Convention that was preparing to nominate Senator Barack Obama for president:\n\nWhat's usually a formality turned a bit dramatic today at the opening of the second day of the Democratic National Convention.\n\nA motion for a voice vote to amend the party platform to declare Jerusalem the capital of Israel - and to reinsert the word \"God\" into the document - was met with many delegates shouting \"no\" and with loud boos when the motion was deemed to have passed.\n\nA plethora of stories spread across the media, the theme of antisemitism in the Democratic Party and on the rise in the American Left.\n\nNow, here we are a full 17 years later, and the antisemitism seen by President Truman in 1948, which then flavored the 2008 Democratic Convention, is well out there right now.\n\nIn the news this week was this story, reported here by Breitbart. The headline : \"'Free Mahmoud!': Protesters Occupy Trump Tower NYC over Arrest of Anti-Israel Activist.\" (RELATED: The Issue Is Not the Issue at Trump Tower Protest )\n\nThe story reported:\n\nDozens of protesters flooded Trump Tower in New York City on Thursday to demand the administration release anti-Israel agitator Mahmoud Khalil who was arrested last weekend and is targeted for deportation.\n\nAt least one of the groups sponsoring the protest is called Jewish Voice for Peace, a group notorious for having a history of sympathizing with terrorists.\n\nGot it.\n\nLet's be plain.\n\nThe antisemitism President Truman picked up on all the way back there in 1948 when he saw it evidenced by liberal State Department bureaucrats has now long since overtaken the modern American Left. Whether at the 2008 Democratic Convention that nominated Barack Obama or this week's turmoil with lefties taking over the lobby of Trump Tower in Manhattan, the same decidedly antisemitic virus is on display. Egged on, in this case, by a leftist group saying they are really Jewish.\n\nThat there is irony in President Trump's saying that New York Senator Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democrat Leader, is no longer really Jewish but rather a Palestinian cannot be ignored. The reason Trump could say something so startling is exactly because the power of the antisemitic Left inside the Democrat Party is a force Schumer has to deal with.\n\nAnd history shows this antisemitism has been, albeit slowly, on the march inside the Democrat Party since all the way back there in the Truman era in 1948.\n\nThe question now is who inside the Democrats will stand up and resist.\n\nAnd one could easily add, if not Senator Schumer, who?\n\nREAD MORE from Jeffrey Lord :\n\nThe Attack on Elon Musk's X\n\nAl Green Sabotages Democrats\n\nTrump v.

      "text": "Democrats' Constitutional Crisis The Left's \"constitutional crisis\" argument is about laying the groundwork.\n\nT he constitutional crisis Democrats are decrying is the one they intend to create. It is part of the campaign to delegitimize Trump that they have been waging for the last decade - from his first campaign to his first term, to their sweeping investigations to two impeachments, to a coordinated lawfare campaign against him, to calling him a \" threat to democracy \" and a \" fascist \" in 2024. Their latest iteration is intended to refute the Supreme Court when it begins to uphold the Trump administration's executive actions.\n\nDonald Trump's sweeping and innovative executive actions have been met at every turn by leftist opposition and frequently court challenges. From immigration to transgender policies to closing government agencies to environmental policies to clawing back federal funds to ending DEI policies and more, these challenges have had some success. Why are we conservatives surprised?\n\nFor decades, the Left has been using America's courts to advance its policies. Unable to make laws (because they lacked sufficient legislative support), the Left learned that they could remake them through judicial decisions. There is scarcely an area of policy where they didn't pursue their strategy without success. So, why are we surprised that the Left is rolling out once more their old strategy under the new guise of constitutional crisis now? (RELATED: Dictatorship of Obama Judges )\n\nWhat must be remembered is that there is no constitutional crisis... yet. For all the Left's bluster, its pronouncement is simply theirs alone, validated by some lower court rulings. The ultimate arbiter of constitutionality remains, as it has since Marbury v. Madison , the Supreme Court - a destination not yet reached by most of the Left's challenges to Trump's executive actions. In short, America's system of judicial review is working just as intended, and America's Left is working it just as expected. (RELATED: Elephant in the Courtroom )\n\nThe only thing novel in all this is the Left's change from their decade-old strategy to delegitimize Trump and what their tactic of declaring his actions a constitutional crisis means for the future - a future in which Democrats are telegraphing their effort to create just such a constitutional crisis. (RELATED: This Mess Is of Your Own Making, Chief Justice Roberts )\n\nWhat Democrats know is that Trump's strongest Washington majority is not in the White House, or the Senate, or the House. It is on the Supreme Court, where a 6-3 conservative majority sits. What Democrats fear is that the Supreme Court will rule that some, perhaps many, of the Trump administration's innovative executive orders are in fact constitutional.\n\nEach such ruling will offer new openings for further executive actions. Even the Supreme Court's blocking of certain executive actions may offer judicial reasoning for second attempts by the Trump administration - just as the Biden administration repeatedly sought creative ways to circumvent the Supreme Court's prohibition of its unilateral student loan forgiveness.\n\nWhat Democrats are doing with their current mantra is laying the groundwork to declare any Supreme Court ruling they dislike a \"constitutional crisis,\" thereby dismissing any adverse ruling's validity.\n\nSuch a preemptory strategy follows the broader strategy of delegitimization that they have pursued against Trump for a decade now.\n\nIn the 2016 campaign, Democrats dismissed Trump as not a serious candidate early. When he won in a stunning upset, they dismissed his victory as a fluke ; several House members contested the counting of electoral votes in 2017.\n\nAfter Democrats took control of the House in 2019, they began relentless investigations of every facet of the Trump administration. These were certainly intended to produce unfavorable news coverage for the administration and encumber various agencies, but from a larger perspective, they were meant to explicitly and implicitly send the message that the president and his administration were not legitimate. House Democrats' two impeachments of Trump only added to their delegitimization message.\n\nPrior to 2024, Democrats unleashed four indictments (resulting in almost 90 criminal charges ) against Trump. If he had not already been delegitimized by their earlier efforts, Democrats were sure this would do the trick.\n\nStunned when their lawfare failed to delegitimize Trump to the broader electorate and remained not just politically viable, but leading their incumbent Joe Biden, Democrats began a campaign of calling Trump a \" threat to democracy ,\" eventually spiraling down to their replacement nominee, Kamala Harris, labeling him a \" fascist .\" Even two assassination attempts on Trump would not dissuade them from their dangerous course of inflammatory political discourse.\n\nHaving been thrown back on their heels by Trump's overwhelming November victory, Democrats have regrouped around the chant of constitutional crisis. While it sounds like a new charge - and the establishment media obligingly echoes along - it is an old strategy: the strategy of delegitimization.\n\nThe only new twist here is that Democrats are now taking it beyond Trump, beyond his administration, and beyond the presidency itself, to the Supreme Court. (RELATED: John Roberts Is Responsible for the High Court's Self-Delegitimization )\n\nIn their maniacal pursuit of Trump, Democrats are preparing the ground to categorically and peremptorily dismiss any Supreme Court rulings they oppose. By preparing to reject Supreme Court rulings - and with it the Court itself - they are threatening the very constitutional crisis they claim to fear.\n\nREAD MORE from J.T.

      "text": "The Best Possible Outcome for Democrats: A Trump Win The Democrats have a chance to remake themselves. Will they?\n\nB ack in July, I wrote a column titled \" What If? Biden Edition .\" It ran through the possibilities around Biden's choices after his disastrous debate. A couple weeks after the column, Pelosi and her left-wing cabal confronted the ailing president. After Pelosi's strong-arming, the president decided to step aside. While terrible for Joe Biden, the decision really was best for the Democrats, even if they're currently miserable with the un-democratically selected Kamala Harris. Why? This election is taking out the dead weight in the Democratic Party all at once and gives them a real chance in four years.\n\nBefore getting to that, here's what I said :\n\n...The idea of the Biden clan letting $160 million campaign dollars out of their meaty paws is almost impossible to fathom, but work with me here.\n\nThere are benefits to this play. First, if Kamala Harris loses (she would, she's terrible), that would take out the second-worst politician on the Democrat side and clear the field of two terrible candidates.\n\nDemocrats are going to have to contend with her spine-tingling hyena-like bark as the \"leader of the Democrat Party\" as the Drudge headline blares today. If Biden stays on and then loses, Kamala is instantly the front-runner. No one likes her, but she possesses two key characteristics that will make the Democrat base (aka single women) happy: she is partially black and she's female.\n\nTrump's take on Kamala Harris is GOLD pic.twitter.com/4mCaJdyTOs\n\n- End Wokeness (@EndWokeness) July 3, 2024\n\nAnother benefit to Biden if Kamala is the candidate and loses: It makes him look better. Hey, he was just giving the party what they wanted. They thought she had a better chance. They were wrong. Biden and his supporters can all pretend that he was the stronger candidate. It gives everyone a way to save face.\n\nFinally, it gives Democrats fuel for their Antifa and BLM rage: See, America is still racist and sexist (is that still a thing with transgenders? Oh, never mind, we're in fantasy land anyway here) and deserves to be destroyed. The problem with this play is that it feels played out. The ante would have to be raised. It will be anyway, if Biden loses, but it would be of a magnitude worse if the psychotic women that make up the Dem party cut loose from their moorings.\n\nIt took a bit of time, but the hagiography of the media around Kamala Harris couldn't hold. She is what she always was: an incompetent, dull-witted woman who achieved her success through horizontal negotiations and pretty privilege. Every time she talks, American voters wince. Every advertisement is a herculean effort in combatting full-body cringe reactions. To Scott McKay's point : Kamala Harris isn't having fun, her campaign isn't having fun, and good grief, her voters aren't having fun. She'll get plenty of votes simply because she has ovaries, but even Biden polled better among women than Harris is now.\n\nIt's a cataclysmic political outcome. Except, it's not.\n\nShould Harris win, it will be worse for the Democrats (and America, but we're talking politics only for the moment). Consider, if she wins, after four disastrous years, she'll be crowding out other, more able candidates. By losing, the Democrats can regroup and find someone who actually has a chance against JD Vance and/or Ron DeSantis, two young and capable politicians waiting in the wings.\n\nBoom! With both Biden and Harris gone, two of the worst politicians in recent memory, the Democrats are free to remake themselves. The question is this, though: will they?\n\nRadical politics has disgusted American voters. Unfettered immigration, playing footsie with terrorists, DEI, transing children and taking away parental rights, and assuming that abortion is the animating social issue for most Americans has alienated voters.\n\nHere's the Democrats' mistake: They mistook personal freedom as a value (which most Americans have) as the only value or the highest value Americans hold. That is not the case. Americans have nuanced views around personal freedom and what it means.\n\nAmericans value economic freedom, and that means having a job and being able to afford to live without crippling inflation. It means being able to buy a house - not with money from the government but because they have enough money to save to buy one.\n\nAmericans value being able to speak freely. They are tired of the self-censorship everywhere. The younger generation of men, in particular, will not accede to the nannying of the speech police. They're in full-on rebellion.\n\nAmericans value American lives. Foreign adventurism and interfering with conflicts that are pointless and endless frustrate American taxpayers. Sending billions overseas when flood victims suffer in North Carolina or fire victims suffer in Maui or train-spill victims suffer in Ohio outrages the sensibilities of honest taxpayers. It's grossly unfair and betrays a callous disregard for one's own citizens that is breathtaking in its brazenness. Usually, politicians at least feign caring - not Joe or Kamala. They wear their contempt with pride.\n\nAmericans value the innocence of children and the freedom to parent without school bureaucrat interference. They also value safety and fairness for their daughters. The trans trend has cheated young women out of their well-earned accomplishments in service to misogynistic men who are aided and abetted by a distorted ideology infecting the minds of the young. Sanctuary states where one parent can run away with a child or children can be taken from loving parents inspire fear in voters.\n\nAmericans value equal opportunity and free choice rather than equal outcomes because they know those are impossible. On the one hand, leftists want to trumpet loudly about radical individualism as if every citizen lives in a bubble of his own making and doesn't interact with the world. On another, leftists want each of these bubble-wrapped individuals to enjoy exactly equal outcomes no matter their life choices . These two things cannot coexist. An individual who decides to dope himself up, become a male prostitute, and contract various diseases is not going to experience the same outcomes as an individual who works hard, saves his money, and buys a house. The output is determined by the input. Americans know this, and so DEI, which promotes \"equity,\" aka equal outcomes, and is prejudiced against white people, no matter their socioeconomic status, outrages them. DEI may get dismantled, but it will take a long time for this infection to leave the bloodstream of corporate America and various government agencies.\n\nAmericans value freedom of religion and association. Despite the godless heathens running the Left, most Americans, even if they themselves don't believe in God, believe in their fellow citizens' right to choose to worship and believe in God. They don't scorn belief. They have their own. Kamala Harris has been the poster child for disrespectful atheistic leftism - outright insulting Catholics and other God-believers and telling them that they don't belong.\n\nThe Democrats can, if they shed some of this risible behavior and their unhelpful political stances, move back to more normalcy. After four years of Trump making America great again, trust that establishment Republicans will be ready and willing to triangulate and make deals with any squishy Republican or Clinton-esque Democrat who comes along.\n\nDemocrats can be counted on to be evil. Republicans can be counted on to play with the devil for their own personal gain. Some Republicans would prefer to be out of power if they find it more personally enriching. It's how Biden accomplished as much as he has these last four horrible years.\n\nNone of that happens if Kamala wins. Should she win, the despair will deepen, the psychotic drive to the socially fascist left will continue, and more able politicians will be crowded out and for longer.\n\nYes, it is always better to win and keep power. Sometimes, though, one needs to cut his losses to fight another day. That's the choice before Democrats. While some Dems might be sad they didn't leave Biden at the top of the ticket, that would have been worse. Biden would have lost, but they'd have to contend with Kamala in four years as the ostensible front-runner. That problem is being solved right now.\n\nFor Republicans, a Kamala loss means facing a strong opponent in four years, for no one could be weaker than she. The GOP will have to accomplish something for once. They'll have to work with their president and stop trying to hamstring him, as McCain and McConnell did the first time around.\n\nAmericans who see a GOP fighting for them and working with the president and upholding all the freedoms they value will win again. If the GOP torpedoes Trump, they'll be committing suicide. But then, it wouldn't be the first time.\n\nThe Brilliant McDonald Trump\n\nKamala Harris Is Melting\n\nIs This Right?

Democrats find themselves adrift, casting about for a compelling messenger,\" the report reads. \" Whoever that is, it's not Biden, many party activists and donors contend. He's tethered to the 2024 defeat and, at 82, is a symbol more of the party's past than its future, they argue.\"\n\nA major Biden supporter who spoke to the outlet on condition of anonymity remarked: \"Who's going to want Joe Biden back in the game?\"\n\nA person close to former first lady Jill Biden told the outlet she and her husband are settling into life in Delaware and that she is also prepared to campaign and raise funds for Democrats. Each of the Bidens has plans to write a book - Joe Biden is working on a theme for his memoir and \"has been consulting former senior administration officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, national security adviser Jake Sullivan and senior White House advisers Mike Donilon and Steve Ricchetti,\" according to the report.\n\nThe former president has been back and forth between his home in Delaware and D.C. for meetings in an office space provided by the federal government, the report continues.\n\nThe report emphasized the Democrats are not \"unanimous\" in wanting help from the Bidens, although some party activists still believe there is admiration for the former president.\n\n\"If you were to call any state party chair and ask them if they wanted Joe Biden to be a keynote speaker for their annual dinner, the answer would be yes. He is beloved by the party and beloved by the voters,\" Jane Kleeb, a vice chair of the DNC, told the outlet.\n\nOther Democrats would rather not remind voters of their failed 2024 presidential campaign and instead find a unifying message from younger leaders.\n\nAlan Kessler, a Democratic fundraiser in Philadelphia, told the outlet that there are many people in the party who are \"obviously very frustrated\" with how the election played out, \"but there are plenty of people who still love Joe Biden.\"\n\nKessler argued that Biden could still be an asset to the party at the \"appropriate time\" and could campaign in certain places, like his hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania. But Kessler said that time is not now, adding that \"it's time to move on with new leadership.\"\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

      "website": "https://www.breitbart.com",
      "text": "Pollak: Klein and Thompson's 'Abundance' Offers Democrats Criticism - and More Utopian Thinking\n\nEzra Klein and Derek Thompson's new book, Abundance , is gaining attention because it includes an unusually frank admission that Democrats have failed because they have placed other priorities ahead of economic growth.\n\nThe book, however, repeats the central mistake of liberalism under the Democratic Party, which is to presume that the role of government is to move the country towards utopia, rather than to protect its citizens from basic dangers and disaster.\n\nKlein and Thompson's criticisms matter because they are decidedly on the left of the political spectrum. Klein played a particularly important role in pushing for Obamacare during the heated debates of 2009-10.\n\nThat utopian policy - universal health care! - failed to reduce the cost of health insurance, or to preserve patient choice, as advertised. It did expand insurance coverage, but largely by expanding Medicaid - an expansion that continues in some Democrat-run states to the point of insolvency.\n\nCalifornia, for example, has to borrow over $6 billion this month alone to cover shortfalls in Medi-Cal, the state's Medicaid program. The reason: California expanded Medi-Cal to illegal aliens.\n\nKlein and Thompson dismiss concerns about migration, but it is a major reason Democrat-run governments are failing.\n\nFor all their truth-telling, Obamacare merits one mention - one! - in the book: \"The Affordable Care Act subsidizes insurance that people can use to pay for health care.\"\n\nThe authors deserve credit for admitting that deep-blue cities and states are failing. They note, for example, that Democrats often undermine their own policies by insisting that major public infrastructure projects also satisfy a long list of criteria (union labor, climate offsets, minority contracts) that prevents them from being built on time, under budget, or at all.\n\nThe conservatives may not be right about everything, but they have a point, the authors admit.\n\nCrucially, Klein and Thompson also argue that today's liberals have adopted an unnecessary and artificial presumption of scarcity. They seem to know that this is because of the religious dogma of climate change, which they share. They try to reform that orthodoxy, emphasizing investment rather than regulation, and technology that could unite \"the life Americans want with the clean energy the planet could tolerate.\"\n\nLiberals need to reject scarcity, and embrace abundance, they argue.\n\nThis sounds new, but in fact it shares much with the original spirit of \"democratic socialism\" in the United States, which argues that an economic system that has failed in every other country where it has been tried will succeed in America because of the great abundance of wealth that generations of capitalism have produced.\n\nKlein and Thompson share something else with socialism - namely, the belief that society can be pushed, or at least nudged, by a wise and powerful government toward an ideal condition.\n\nIt is difficult to take that proposition seriously, especially reading the book - as I did last weekend - from the home to which my family and I have been relocated due to the wildfires that devastated Los Angeles in January.\n\nOur state, the fifth-richest economy in the world and home to the most advanced technology humanity has ever invented, failed to provide the water, or the men, necessary to fight the fires.\n\nNever mind utopia; we don't get the basics right here.\n\nSpeaking of the Golden State, Klein and Thompson let Governor Gavin Newsom off the hook. The authors almost laud Newsom for his willingness to admit that there is a problem with Democratic governance. They note that he wisely ended the doomed high-speed rail system that was to have connected San Francisco and L.A. But they blame \"negotiating\" for the delays in building Newsom's scaled-down, rural version of the project.\n\nThey admit that the high-speed rail project would never have been built at all, had it been proposed in its present form - then lament that it is taking so long.\n\nAt some point, harder questions have to be asked about leadership, about competence - and about corruption. Indeed, President Donald Trump is auditing California's high-speed rail project to understand where all the money went.\n\nCalifornia's failures matter, because Newsom is likely running for president in 2028 - hence his turn to podcasting, as his state burns. He is running on cultural issues, not on his record, because after a lifetime in office, he has no record. Over his tenure, California has neglected forestry, policing, infrastructure, water storage, elementary education - the first priorities.\n\nMeanwhile, the state is burning - so badly, and so frequently, that it is losing six times more carbon from federal land than any other state.\n\nThe cost of utopia, for my neighbors, is the destruction of thousands of individual dreams.\n\nWe have \"abundance.\" We lack the basics. Write a book for Democrats about that.\n\nJoel B.

      "text": "Pressure Mounts on Senate Democrats to Avert a Government Shutdown\n\nSenate Democrats have long discussed the need to avoid a government shutdown, claiming it would lead to \"chaos and pain and needless heartache.\"\n\nThe House on Tuesday passed a stop-gap spending bill that would avert a government shutdown for six months, or through the end of the fiscal year on September 30.\n\nDemocrats had preferred to work on a shorter-term stop-gap bill, otherwise known as a continuing resolution (CR), however, Republicans want to avoid a shutdown to focus on passing President Donald Trump's \"big, beautiful\" bill to extend and expand the Trump tax cuts, secure the border, and much, much, more.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD), on the Senate floor Tuesday, asked if Democrats would be willing to shut down the government:\n\nI think the American people are going to be interested to see whether the Democrats are going to filibuster - and, by filibustering, shut down the federal government.\n\nIt is on them if this happens.\n\nThere is a funding vehicle available coming over from the House of Representatives that will fund the government through the end of the fiscal year - September 30 - and we are prepared to take it up here in the Senate and make sure that, on Friday, the government stays open.\n\nBut it will be up to the Democrats as to whether or not that happens.\n\nThe focus now turns to Senate Democrats and if they would back such a short-term plan to stop a government shutdown.\n\nMany Senate Democrats, in similar situations, have long discussed the potentially disastrous effects of a government shutdown, even if it were a short one.\n\nSen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said in September, \"Remember: Trump has spent the month urging House Republicans to shut the government down if his poison pills weren't passed. It's outlandishly cynical. He knows a shutdown would mean chaos and pain and needless heartache for the American people. But clearly he doesn't care.\"\n\nSen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) last year said, ahead of a spending fight showdown, that the fact Congress has \"come to the brink so many times is really embarrassing to Congress.\"\n\n\"While I'm relieved this CR avoids a disastrous shutdown, funding the gov't shouldn't be a crisis manufactured by the GOP each year. I look forward to Congress voting on a full gov't funding package next week, given our national security & essential gov't operations are at stake,\" Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) wrote in mid-December 2022, right after the Senate passed a one-week bill to stop a government shutdown.\n\nIn September 2023, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) accused House Republicans of wanting to close \"preschool programs\" and having soldiers go unpaid by moving toward a shutdown.\n\n\"I'm glad we averted a government shutdown and passed essential disaster aid for Southwest Virginians, but Virginians deserve more than this constant chaos,\" Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) said in December. \"Shutdowns aren't victimless crimes - we need to negotiate robust, bipartisan spending bills.\"\n\nSen. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) said a shutdown would leave \"men and women in uniform working without pay, farmers without critical support, and children without the nutrition programs they rely on.\"\n\nSen. Raphael Warnock (D-GA) in December said that shutdown threats amount to \"political brinksmanship that centers politicians and not the people.\"\n\nIn February 2023, Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI) claimed that even a partial shutdown could be disastrous.\n\nShe wrote, \"Yet again, House Republicans are threatening to shut down the government. Even a partial shutdown could disrupt supply chains, hurt small businesses, risk travel delays, and increase food prices for millions of Americans. This isn't a game. House Republicans, do your job.\"\n\nSean Moran is a policy reporter for Breitbart News.

      "text": "The Art of the Yield: Democrats Surrender, Hand Trump Government Spending Win\n\nSenate Democrats talked tough, but in the end, they folded like a cheap tent.\n\nNine Democrats and one Independent joined with Republicans to end debate and proceed to a final vote on the continuing resolution (CR) to avert a shutdown.\n\nThe 62-38 vote - 60 votes were needed - is a victory for President Donald Trump, who invested significant political capital over several weeks ensuring the bill passed the House en route to the Senate.\n\nSenate Democrats' yielding to Trump's CR infuriated House Democrats, who were almost united in standing against the bill. Only one House Democrat - Rep. Jared Golden, representing a rural Maine district won by Trump - defected Tuesday when the CR passed the House.\n\nMinority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) fueled the fury of the Democrats' base earlier in the week.\n\nSchumer announced on the Senate floor Wednesday the Republicans did not have the votes for their plan, presumably to force them to negotiate with Democrats. Yet Thursday, he announced he would support the CR.\n\nUltimately, Democrats received no concessions other than a handful of amendment votes doomed to fail.\n\nHouse Democrat leadership returned to Washington Friday afternoon to speak against the CR, a remarkable rebuke of Schumer in which the leaders refused to confirm Schumer should remain leader.\n\nIn a damage-control Senate floor speech before the vote, Schumer said, \"The vote before us is a Hobson's choice\" - using terminology from an earlier Breitbart News report that posited Schumer did not have a choice at all in passing the CR.\n\n\"The CR bill is a bad bill. But as bad as the CR is, I believe that allowing Donald Trump to take even more power via a government shutdown is a far worse option,\" he said.\n\nSen. John Fetterman's (D-PA) announcement that he would support cloture preceded Schumer's, but the third Democrat announcement did not come until minutes before the vote.\n\nDemocrats joining Schumer and Fetterman were Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto (NM), Brian Schatz (HI), Dick Durbin (IL), Maggie Hassan (NH), Kirsten Gillibrand (NY), and retiring Sens. Gary Peters (MI) and Jeanne Shaheen (NH), along with Angus King (I-ME).\n\nSens. Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), members of Schumer's leadership team, voted against the CR, in a sign of trouble ahead for Schumer.\n\nBut more significantly, the episode signals the growing civil war inside a Democratic Party searching for a strategy and a spine as it combats Trump's second administration.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump and Republicans continue piling up wins, with no end in sight.\n\nThe vote on final passage will take place Friday evening. It needs only a simple majority.\n\nBradley Jaye is Deputy Political Editor for Breitbart News.

      "text": "Trump: Democrats Would Be Responsible for Government Shutdown if It Happens\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Democrats would shoulder the responsibility for a government shutdown if there is one after the Continuing Resolution (CR) passed the House of Representatives Wednesday.\n\nTrump put the onus on Democrats while speaking to reporters during an Oval Office sit-down with North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Secretary General Mark Rutte.\n\nTrump noted that if Senate Democrats do not get on board with passing this CR, they would be \"stopping all of these good things that we're providing\" as Republicans look to pass major tax and border legislation either in one bill or separately on the heels of Trump's mandate election, in which the border and economy were the top two issues.\n\n\"If there's a shutdown, it's only because of the Democrats, and they would really be taking away a lot from our country and from the people of our country,\" he added.\n\nThe CR passed the House by a vote of 217-213, with all Republicans, except Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY), supporting it. Rep. Jared Golden (R-ME) was the lone Democrat to vote for the bill.\n\nWith the government set to expire at the end of the day Friday, all eyes are on Senate Democrats, as they will need to join Republicans to reach the 60-vote threshold to allow a floor vote on the CR and avoid a government shutdown. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said Wednesday that Democrats would reject the funding bill. However, Schumer's posturing reportedly began to change, at least behind the scenes, as of Thursday, as Breitbart News Deputy Politics Editor Bradley Jaye noted , citing the Hill :\n\nThe Hill reports that Senate Democrats are giving private assurances they will not allow a government shutdown, despite the activist wing with its growing chokehold over the party demanding further resistance to Trump.\n\nThe report says despite Schumer insisting on an amendment vote on a shorter-term CR to give appropriators more time to negotiate a massive omnibus bill, he is giving his \"centrists\" space to vote to end debate and proceed to final passage.\n\nCiting Democrats familiar with internal deliberations, The Hill reports Schumer's Wednesday positioning against the CR was a maneuver \"designed to save face.\"\n\nTrump said Thursday he hears \"a lot of Democrats are going to vote for it\" and that he has personally \"spoken to some of them\" who want to.\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

      "text": "Thune Calls Senate Democrats' Bluff, Moves Forward on Trump-Backed, House-Passed Funding Plan\n\nSenate Democrats are dancing with the devil in the sinister form of a Schumer shutdown.\n\nDemocrat Leader Chuck Schumer (NY) announced Wednesday afternoon following a lunch with his Democrat caucus that he would reject a House-passed government plan to keep the government funded past the Friday deadline through the end of the fiscal year, September 30.\n\n\"Funding the government should be a bipartisan effort, but Republicans chose a partisan path, drafting their continuing resolution without any input - any input - from congressional Democrats,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor. \"Because of that, Republicans do not have the votes in the Senate to invoke cloture on the House CR.\"\n\nLegislation in the Senate requires 60 votes to invoke cloture - a necessary step in ending debate and advancing a bill.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune is calling Schumer's bluff. He moved forward Wednesday evening to schedule a vote to invoke cloture Friday.\n\nThune has 53 Republicans to Schumer's 47 Democrats, although Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) has stated he will oppose the CR. Therefore, eight Democrats will be needed to invoke cloture and fast track the bill.\n\nThe relatively-clean continuing resolution (CR) totals only 99 pages, and includes minimal modifications to current spending levels - including $485 million for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) requested by President Donald Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, to facilitate continued deportations.\n\nOutside of those minor modifications, Democrats overwhelmingly supported these spending levels in December, although freezing current spending levels throughout an entire fiscal year would be a monumental achievement for Republican spending hawks.\n\nThe CR passed the House Tuesday with one Democrat in support and one Republican, Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY), bucking his party. Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and other top Trump administration officials invested significant political capital to pass the bill.\n\nThe ball is now in the hands of Senate Democrats, unaccustomed to the pressure of being down late with possession and the game on the line.\n\nYet despite their tough posturing, Democrats, who have vociferously protested Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) freezing of federal funds and firing of government employees, may face a Hobson's choice on the bill.\n\nBy rejecting the House-passed CR and triggering a shutdown, Democrats would furlough hundreds of thousands of government employees, undermining their projected concerns for those workers.\n\nSince Trump returned to office, essentially the only policy Democrats have successfully coalesced against is Trump's termination of government employees and funding and hiring freezes. Shutting down the government and rejecting spending levels Democrats overwhelming supported in December would render their lone message moot.\n\nWith Republicans holding the upper hand and no Democrat thus far emerging as the party's messaging and moral leader in the second age of Trump, Democrats are unlikely to extract any concessions from Republicans - who hold the Senate, House, White House, momentum, and seemingly all the cards.\n\nIf Democrats ultimately reject Thune's CR and trigger a shutdown, it is unlikely Republicans would concede anything significant to Democrats to entice them to end it.\n\nAnd clips of Democrats rejecting shutdown politics in the past would play on endless loops.\n\nDemocrats have advocated a 30-day CR to enable work to continue on a massive omnibus bill, and Schumer's rank-and-file would like Thune to allow a vote on a 30-day CR as an amendment to the House-passed full-fiscal year CR. To entice Thune, Democrats have suggested they would allow a time agreement to enable expedited consideration of the bill.\n\nThat is unlikely to happen. Were that amendment (or any other) to be successful, it would require the House to return to Washington.\n\nDemocrats also demand an amendment vote to ensure Trump cannot spend under appropriated spending levels or continue finding waste, fraud, and abuse through DOGE.\n\nAgain, not happening.\n\nBut if Thune remains on course and Democrats refuse to allow speedier bill consideration, Democrats face another test.\n\nWithout a time agreement, which would require unanimous consent, the soonest a CR might be passed would be Saturday evening, meaning a brief but inconsequential lapse in government funding over the weekend.\n\nForcing even a brief shutdown by intransigently delaying the inevitable could alone be a black eye for Democrats desperately searching for a party rebrand.\n\nFor now, Democrats are publicly signaling they will stand up to Thune. But ultimately, a choice between spending levels they don't like and a government shutdown might be no choice at all.\n\nBradley Jaye is Deputy Political Editor for Breitbart News.

      "text": "'Moderate' Democrats Tell Candidates: Don't Talk About Migration\n\nSelf-styled moderate Democrats are pushing a future campaign message on the issue that defeated Kamala Harris: Don't talk about migration.\n\nInstead, Democrats should wrap themselves in the flag and patriotic imagery, says a five-page strategy memo drafted by Third Way, a pseudo-moderate Democrat group that held a post-election \"Comeback Retreat\" in February 2025:\n\nEmbrace patriotism, community, and traditional American imagery (e.g., farms, main streets).\n\nThe memo mentions immigration once - but only to slam the GOP's messaging on the issue: \"Democrats often let Republicans set the terms of cultural debates (e.g., crime, immigration) instead of clearly defining their own positions in a way that resonates with voters.\"\n\nPolitico published the memo, which says:\n\nIn early February 2025, Third Way gathered a group of highly experienced and passionate political professionals over 1.5 days to begin to chart the Democratic comeback. As part of this retreat, attendees participated in breakout sessions to deliberate on why Democrats are struggling with working-class voters around cultural issues, the nature of the economic trust gap with this critical group, and ideas for how to address both problems.\n\nThe Third Way group likely leaked the memo to Politico , which described it as \"centrist\" in exchange.\n\nOne of the Third Way founders is Jim Kessler. He worked for Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), who has twice lost control of the Senate due to his corporate-backed, pro-migration policies.\n\nIn 2013, for example, Kessler backed the Gang of Eight amnesty and cheap-labor bill that cost the Democrats five seats in 2014. \"This memo outlines the best way to reach the conflicted middle - using the key words tough, fair, and practical,\" Kessler wrote.\n\nThose poll-tested terms were widely used by President Joe Biden's pro-migration border chief, Alejandro Mayorkas, and by Kamala Harris's pro-migration , investor-led 2024 campaign .\n\nBut the poll-tested terms did not prevent Mayorkas's radical policies from pushing Donald Trump back into the White House and the Republicans back into the Senate's majority.\n\nTrump built his 2024 campaign on a popular pro-American migration policy . Once in office, he has quickly succeeded in almost entirely stopping the blue-collar southern portion of Mayorkas's migrant flood. Those policies are also nudging up wages and are forcing more foreign investment in the blue-collar U.S. economy.\n\nTrump's migration messaging on crime, wages, and housing entirely trumped the Democrats' effort to control voters with law-and-order evasions , moral blackmail , and language hijacked from the 1960s civil rights campaigns.\n\nSo far, Trump has not curbed the white-collar airport inflow that was supercharged by Mayorkas despite the huge damage to white-collar Americans.\n\nBut the Third Way memo simply ignores the economic damage caused to voters by migration.\n\nBiden's four years showed how migration causes Americans to lose earning power in the labor and housing markets, and lose the investment, productivity, and training once provided by employers.\n\nThey lose white-collar career opportunities to corporate outsourcing, civic stability amid government-imposed social diversity , and political power as expanding blocs of ethnic voters demand benefits for their communities, cultures, and home countries.\n\nAmericans also lose confidence as the government's migration policy crudely works to extract human resources from poor countries for use in the U.S. economy.\n\nBut the Third Way's approach to migration is shared by many other Democrats, partly because many Democratic donors profit heavily from migration.\n\nDebu Gandi, the immigration policy chief at the establishment-funded Center for American Progress, recently admitted:\n\nWe [Democrats] have failed to respond adequately to a national and global political climate increasingly skeptical of immigration and unsympathetic to the reasons driving people to come to wealthier nations. We haven't done enough to respond to upset Americans who believe there's an extralegal backdoor into the United States and fear diminished opportunities in their own country.\n\nYet the fix pushed by Gandhi to the Democrats' migration problem is More Cowbell .\n\nHe urges Congress to spend even more taxpayer money ushering more yet more migrants into jobs and housing needed by ordinary taxpaying Americans:\n\nFederal immigration integration resources are modest and largely focused on permanent residents seeking to become U.S. citizens; they should be scaled up and made available to other immigrants as well.\n\nOne leader of Third Way seems to be Rachel Pritzker. She is a member of the billionaire Pritzker family whose real-estate wealth has spiked amid the massive inflow of President Joe Biden's 9 million southern migrants.\n\nThe Third Way group itself already follows its don't-mention-migration advice - and does not show any staff working on migration issues.\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

      "text": "Far-Left Group Threatens Primary Challenges Against Establishment Democrats: 'Time to Clean Up Shop'\n\nThe time has come to \"clean up shop\" in the Democratic Party, according to the radical progressive Justice Democrats movement, who are threatening to target entrenched Democrats in \"deep blue\" districts, citing failures of party leadership in 2024 and its alignment with billionaire donors, according to the left-wing magazine Salon .\n\nThe Justice Democrats, a progressive group known for backing insurgent primary challengers like radical \"Squad\" member Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, are planning to reignite their campaign against establishment Democrats ahead of the 2026 midterms, according to an interview with Salon published Sunday.\n\nThe group, critical of the Democratic Party's leadership after its crushing 2024 losses, aims to field primary challengers in safe blue districts who they claim have failed to represent working-class constituents.\n\n\"It's time to clean up shop in the Democratic Party, frankly,\" Usamah Andrabi, a spokesman for the group, told the magazine.\n\nAndrabi criticized the party's inability to deliver significant victories in 2024, citing a misalignment between its establishment's strategies and the needs of its voter base.\n\nThe group, which played a pivotal role in electing high-profile radical progressives like \"Squad\" Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), plans to scrutinize districts held by Democrats who they believe are not adequately serving their communities.\n\nAndrabi emphasized the party's failure to reconcile its \"big tent\" strategy, accusing leadership of catering to billionaires at the expense of everyday Americans.\n\n\"For so long the Democratic Party has tried to be a big tent that somehow includes the working class and the billionaire class and that says it fights for the interests of the working class,\" he said. \"We continue to allow our party to align ourselves with the wealthiest few and everyday people are beginning to take notice.\"\n\nThe Justice Democrats' renewed focus comes amid growing tensions between the Democratic establishment and its progressive wing, exacerbated by post-election infighting. While some blamed factors like inflation and cultural issues for the losses, progressives argue that the party's embrace of billionaire-backed strategies alienated its working-class base.\n\n\"There are members of this party that we are not going to be able to convince to actually stand up for working people,\" Andrabi stated.\n\nThe matter comes as Republicans' sweeping win in 2024 saw them regain control of the House, Senate, and presidency, leaving Democrats in disarray.\n\nIn response to Trump's victory, Justice Democrats warned that the \"devastating\" outcome threatens an \"all-out assault on our democracy,\" while calling on Democratic leadership to \"take responsibility.\"\n\nThe once influential group is now aiming to reclaim momentum after recent losses, setting up a fierce intra-party clash for 2026.\n\nJoshua Klein is a reporter for Breitbart News.

(RELATED: Kamala Campaign's Latest Reported Scapegoat For Failure: Her Chair Height)\n\nWATCH:\n\n\"The concern I have for Democrats is just a handful of years ago, I would say that every day that, for every thousand young people who turn 18, Molly, like 700 of them, six or 700 of them, have values aligned with the Democrat Party,\" Della Volpe said. \"It was like this incredible opportunity for the Democrats to kind of cement kind of their values with an emerging generation. They didn't communicate that very well.\"\n\n\"And now we're living, you know, in what I think is the beginning of a post-ideological era with younger people, okay, where, because of the concerns about economics, they're voting in what they would say is a much more pragmatic way than they did, you know, in maybe '16 or, you know, in '18 or even in '20,\" he continued. \"So that's a concern if younger people agree with Democrats on most issues, but they're not voting in the numbers that they voted with Democrats in the past. That's a huge concern because my generation is just getting more conservative, right?\"\n\nDella Volpe is part of Generation X, according to his website. Generation X represents people who were born between 1965 and 1980, according to the National Institute on Retirement Security.\n\nPresident Donald Trump gained significant support with young voters against former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024 compared to his backing among the crucial demographic against former President Joe Biden in 2020, according to CNN chief data analyst Harry Enten.\n\n\"If you look at the Trump versus Democrat margin, you look at voters under the age of 25, you go back to 2020,\" the data analyst said. \"Look, Joe Biden won this group overwhelmingly. Look at that, by 34 points. You look at 2024. Look, Kamala Harris won it, but just by 11.\"\n\n\"Trump gained more among voters under the age of 25 than any other age group,\" he continued. \"If you think of young people as being Democrats, while they may still lean Democrat, not in any way in the same numbers that they used to just even four years ago, Donald Trump doing considerably better among younger voters.\"\n\nTrump also made significant inroads with Hispanic men during the 2024 election, securing a majority of their votes nationwide.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

We humbly ask you to consider joining us in this fight.\n\nNow that millions of readers are rejecting the increasingly biased and even corrupt corporate  media and \n\t\t\t\t\tjoining us daily, there are powerful forces lined up to stop us: the old guard of the news media hopes \n\t\t\t\t\tto marginalize us; the big corporate ad agencies want to deprive us of revenue and put us out of business; \n\t\t\t\t\tsenators threaten to have our reporters arrested for asking simple questions; the big tech platforms want \n\t\t\t\t\tto limit our ability to communicate with you; and the political party establishments feel threatened by our \n\t\t\t\t\tindependence.\n\nWe don't complain -- we can't stand complainers --  but we do call it how we see it.

      "text": "Ex-Biden Aide Says Trump Always Takes Advantage Of One Opportunity Democrats Do Not\n\n(Screenshot/Fox News)\n\nA man who was an aide to former President Joe Biden said Thursday on Fox News that there's a contrast between how Democrats handle press interactions versus how President Donald Trump handles them.\n\nThat man, Michael LaRosa, appeared on \"The Ingraham Angle\" to say that Trump understands something about the media that Democrats do not.\n\nHost Laura Ingraham asked about the strategy behind Biden's nomination. She said that the Biden campaign controlled media coverage tightly and restricted journalists at events and even limited phone usage at small gatherings where Biden relied heavily on a teleprompter. Former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer criticized Democrats for expecting the press to align with them and for not tolerating media scrutiny. LaRosa said he agreed and also said Democrats should emulate the way Trump engages with the press.\n\n\"Yeah, and the one event that Joe Biden has done since he left the White House, they also told people that they're not allowed to record it. They didn't want anybody to see it. There was no press allowed,\" Fleischer said. \"Here's the problem that Democrats have with the press. They expect the press to work for them. They know that the press is ideologically aligned with them. They know that the press doesn't like Donald Trump, and so they expect the press to fall in line.\"\n\nWATCH:\n\nFleischer said Republicans expect tough media coverage and do not expect loyalty from the press, which contrasts with Democrats, who expect media compliance.\n\n\"Now, therefore, if there ever is an aberration to that pattern, they'd berate the press in a way like Republicans do not do. Republicans understand we're gonna get a hard time from the press no matter what. That bar is low,\" Fleischer said. \"If we ever have a good day in the press, it's because there was a low bar, and we jumped over it. And so we don't have to worry about the press betraying us [the way] that Democrats do. And on those rare occasions when the press actually holds an account, they can't stand it because they think the press is their employee.\"\n\nThe former Biden aide agreed and said Democrats need to change the way they approach media relations. (RELATED: Black Voter In Swing State Says The One Thing Democrats Don't Want To Hear)\n\n\"I would just somewhat agree with him because I think what President Trump does is sort of what I would advise every Democrat to do, but it reflects a problem in our party. This culture of treating the press as a hazard instead of an opportunity,\" Larosa said. \"Trump doesn't miss the opportunity to speak to a microphone. He engages, and he's proactive. It's the opposite with Democrats. And we have to get over that because voters crave authenticity. You can't be authentic, or you can't be perceived as authentic if you are never in unscripted environments.\"\n\nBiden avoided interacting with the media and did not hold the traditional press conference in 2023. Just like Biden, former Vice President Kamala Harris also avoided interacting with the press.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "Black Voter In Swing State Says The One Thing Democrats Don't Want To Hear\n\n(Screenshot/NBC News)\n\nBlack male voters in swing states said on NBC News Thursday that they stand by their decision to support President Donald Trump.\n\n\"Meet The Press\" interviewed Black men in swing states who cast their votes for Trump in the 2024 election. Despite saying they had some reservations about Trump's methods as president, most reaffirmed their support for him.\n\n\"I approve because he's weeding out a lot of things that the other, I would say Biden and Kamala Harris, disrupted in the United States. It's going to be a tough job for him in the Trump administration as a whole, but I'm just willing to wait and see what goes forth from now,\" Marlon M., a 47-year-old Democrat from Pennsylvania, said.\n\nWATCH:\n\nThomas A., a 49-year-old Democrat from Georgia who voted for Biden in 2020 and switched to Trump in 2024, said he does not fully agree with one of Trump's methods but still supports him.\n\n\"I believe that he's getting rid of the clutter in things that have been there for a long period of time, and he's just cleaning house, but there's a way to do it. And so I don't 100% agree totally [with] how he's cleaning house, but there are some areas that need to be improved within the government,\" Thomas said.\n\nIllya M. said Trump, as president, takes an approach that is proactive.\n\n\"He said he's going to do some things. He did a lot of things,\" Illya M. said.\n\n\"At least he tried and actually did something. So that's more than I could say about the Democrats probably ever.\"\n\nNot all feedback, however, was positive as Jeffrey G., who disapproves of Trump, said he's concerned about how Trump has handled personnel changes within the government. (RELATED: 'Never Seen Anything Like This': Crucial Voter Groups Fleeing Democrats, Says Stunned Fmr Clinton Pollster)\n\n\"I disapprove of the way he's handled the firings of government employees. Firing the public sector versus the private sector are two different animals. In my opinion, he should have gone in with a scalpel instead of a blowtorch. I think the economy right now is in a position where they're hurting, and they need help,\" Jeffrey said.\n\nIn a recent NBC News focus group , Black men in swing states who voted for Trump in November remain largely supportive of his administration, despite saying they're concerned about the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and Trump's tariff policies. Although most of the focus group participants continue to support Trump, there is a divide on issues like diversity, equity and inclusion programs and economic strategies to combat inflation. Some participants said they are frustrated because the Democratic Party lacks direction.\n\nUpon taking office in January, Trump immediately began signing executive orders. His approach included dismantling the Department of Education and reversing initiatives set by previous administrations. The Democrats have formed a resistance against Trump and his initiatives, particularly DOGE, which has reduced the federal workforce.\n\nIn response to Trump's policies, a coalition of national Democratic groups such as the Democratic National Committee, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and the Association of State Democratic Committees launched the \"People's Town Halls\" tour. They are targeting Republican-controlled districts throughout the U.S. The Democrats had significant losses in the 2024 elections. That same year, Republicans won the White House and the Senate and retained the House.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "Victor Davis Hanson Says Trump's Counter-Revolutionary Tactics May Disrupt Democrats For Generations\n\n(Screenshot/Newsmax)\n\nHoover Institution Senior Fellow Victor Davis Hanson said on Newsmax Wednesday that President Donald Trump's counter-revolutionary tactics might disrupt the Democratic Party for generations.\n\nTrump's current counter-revolutionary tactics include a comprehensive policy overhaul targeting diversity, equity, and inclusion ( DEI ) programs across federal institutions, dismantling the Department of Education and reversing policies established under earlier administrations. During an appearance on \"Finnerty,\" Hanson said President Trump is a fundamentally different kind of leader, one who is reshaping the Republican strategy.\n\n\"I don't think they understand Donald Trump. He is not George W. Bush. He's not a Mitt Romney. He's not a John McCain. He's not satisfied to just slow down the growth of the administrative state and neo-socialism,\" Hanson said. \"He's a counter revolutionary. Yeah. And he's saying economically, politically, socially, militarily, this country has gone way to the left, and I'm going to bring it back to the center. And that's so disruptive.\"\n\nWATCH:\n\nHanson went on to say that the Democrats' current lack of significant political power - being without the Supreme Court, the Senate, the House, and the presidency - leaves them with limited tools.\n\n\"They didn't think any Republican had the courage or the gumption to do that. And he does. He's serious. And now they're thinking, 'My God, the guy is really serious. He could really disrupt us for a generation,'\" Hanson said. \"And we've got to stop him at any means necessary. We don't have the Supreme Court. We don't have the House. We don't have the Senate. We don't have the White House. We didn't win the popular vote. We didn't win the Electoral [College], but we don't have political power other than the street and our mouth.\"\n\nHanson did not mince words in describing the ongoing struggles of the Democrats, who, despite recognizing the factors diminishing their public appeal, continue to escalate their rhetoric and actions.\n\n\"Normally any party would self-correct. They did that after George McGovern. They did it after Jimmy Carter, and they went full centrist with Bill Clinton, or at least they feigned centrism. But this is unusual that they know what's killing them, and yet they double down on it,\" Hanson added. \"It's almost like a mixture of, I guess I'd call it smut chic all the way down to terrorist porn, because they're cutting videos where senators are saying S-H-I-T, or they're calling Elon Musk a D-I-C-K, or A-S, this horrible, this smut language.\"\n\nHanson said Democrats' increasingly provocative media tactics surprise everyone.\n\n\"So I don't think there's a bottom to it. There should be, but each day surprises all of us if they get more and more pornographic, more and more smutty, and more and more participating, wink and nod, with terrorism.\" (RELATED: 'Never Seen Anything Like This': Crucial Voter Groups Fleeing Democrats, Says Stunned Fmr Clinton Pollster)\n\nHanson's remarks come as tensions flare on both sides of the aisle. In a recent House Oversight Subcommittee hearing on the funding of NPR and PBS, Democratic Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett lashed out at Republicans with a string of expletives, expressing her discontent under the chairmanship of Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nIn an attempt to further oppose Trump's agenda, a coalition of national Democratic organizations, including the Democratic National Committee, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and the Association of State Democratic Committees, launched the \"People's Town Halls\" tour. They are focusing on Republican-held districts across the U.S., following significant Democratic Party losses in the 2024 elections where Republicans took control of the White House and both congressional chambers.\n\nDemocrats have formed a resistance to oppose Trump's policies, specifically targeting the Department of Government Efficiency led by Elon Musk, which has cut the number of federal agency employees.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "'I Hope Nobody Taped That': Video Captures Debbie Dingell, Other Democrats Speaking Candidly About Protesting Trump\n\n(Screenshot/YouTube/WashtenawDems)\n\nA video from a gathering of the Washtenaw County Democratic Party, posted earlier this month, captured Democratic Michigan Rep. Debbie Dingell and other Democrats speaking candidly about their strategies to protest President Donald Trump.\n\nThe meeting called \"Democratic Responses to Trump's Attacks & Lessons Learned from 2024 MI House Races,\" attended by various activist groups and Democratic organizers, was intended to rally the Democratic base and coordinate efforts to counteract Republican policies. During the meeting, a young Black man spoke positively about Trump's decision to appoint Alice Marie Johnson as pardon czar and applauded his move as a meaningful step towards criminal justice reform.\n\n\"A couple points slash concerns to bring up. I think one thing that's missing in this conversation,\" the young man asked Washtenaw County Prosecutor Eli Savit.\"Trump appointed a new pardon czar. And it's a Black woman, a real Black. And so I bring that up to bring up the point that the Republicans are kind of moving in on what is traditionally like a progressive concept, right? You know, giving people back there for very different reasons though, right? He's trying to take care of the people that take care of him, whereas I don't see very strong Democrat messaging on this point at all.\"\n\nWATCH:\n\nHis comment led to a tense moment when a man tried to take the microphone from him, and the audience visibly disapproved. Trump recently announced he's appointing Johnson as pardon czar. During his first term, he granted her a full pardon for her non-violent drug offense, after she spent 22 years in prison. (RELATED: 'You Are Not Fighting': Republicans Aren't The Only Ones Facing Rabid Town Halls)\n\nThe video also captured Dingell hinting at tactics to go against Trump. This, amid discussions meant to rally the Democratic base against Trump's influence and strategize for upcoming elections.\n\nWATCH:\n\n\"We need to make sure it's in every one of those damn conservative, wherever they're communicating, and we have to be the voices that are smart, targeted and effective, and fighting back. And the way we do it. We litigate. We legislate. We only need three votes, three Republican votes. I don't know that we can ever get the person that's closest to us, but he is chair of Ed and Labor, but we need to be targeting someone that may want to run for governor,\" Dingell said.\n\nDingell's plan involves not only traditional legislative efforts, but also legal battles and public education campaigns designed to shift public opinion.\n\n\"I'm not gonna give you names so I can't get in total trouble but take your brain one little bit. We need to be targeting all that. Then we need to be educating, that's raising the stories, that's telling people what is happening. We've got to be advocating, and we gotta be communicating. So that's the five-prong strategy, litigate, legislate, educate, advocate, communicate,\" Dingell said. \"I wish I could be more cheerful, but there's a lot of work, and we gotta keep that energy up. I could do a couple. I'll do a couple. I'll speed to Bloomfield Hills [near Detroit].\"\n\nAfter speaking, Dingell muttered, \"I hope nobody taped that.\"\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "'Never Seen Anything Like This': Crucial Voter Groups Fleeing Democrats, Says Stunned Fmr Clinton Pollster\n\n(Screenshot/Fox News)\n\nFormer Clinton pollster Mark Penn said Friday on Fox News that crucial voter groups are fleeing the Democratic Party.\n\nThe Democratic Party's favorability rating plummeted to a new low of 29%, according to a CNN/SSRS poll conducted from March 6-9. During an appearance on \"Hannity,\" Penn said he was shocked at the current state of the Democratic Party and said he's never seen its rating this low in decades.\n\n\"I've never seen anything like this in over 40 years of polling. The Democratic Party ratings have collapsed from a 47% favorable down to 29, 27 in some of these polls, and that's an incredible loss of moderate, working-class voters,\" Penn said.\n\nWATCH:\n\nPenn said that the party seems to be shrinking to a base composed primarily of left-wing advocates like Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who have been actively promoting the Democratic platform across the country. (RELATED: 'Finish This Party Off': Former Clinton Pollster Warns AOC Challenging Chuck Schumer Could Be Final Blow For Democrats)\n\n\"Those [are the] kinds of voters that the Democratic Party needs to win elections, and it's being shrunk to a base of left-wing advocates like Bernie Sanders and AOC who were touring the country carrying the Democratic banner. That's not helping,\" Penn added.\n\nA group of national Democratic organizations, including the Democratic National Committee, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and the Association of State Democratic Committees, initiated the \"People's Town Halls\" tour last Friday in Iowa, targeting Republican-controlled districts throughout the U.S. This campaign follows the Democratic Party's substantial losses in the 2024 elections, where Republicans captured the White House and majorities in both chambers of Congress.\n\nDemocrats have formed a resistance to oppose President Donald Trump's policies, specifically targeting the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), headed by Elon Musk, which has reduced federal agency workforces. The creation of DOGE, which aims to cut government expenditures, has ignited fierce Democratic Party resistance, but it has also garnered significant support from the American populace.\n\nIn the House, Ocasio-Cortez has attacked the Trump-endorsed government spending bill, calling it a \"slush fund\" for Trump and Musk on social media. Meanwhile, Democratic Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman slammed his party's resistance to the bill, dismissing it as \"total theater.\"\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "DAVID BOSSIE: Things Aren't Looking Good For Democrats\n\nKayla Bartkowski/Getty Images\n\nPresident Donald Trump's first historic election in 2016 gave rise to an untreatable condition known as Trump Derangement Syndrome.\n\nRadical leftists could not come to grips with a conservative reform-minded businessman and political outsider coming to Washington to confront the failed status quo that they had presided over for decades. Trump's common-sense America First agenda caused Democrats to lose their collective minds, so they settled on the absurd policy of viciously attacking whatever the president did, no matter what. (RELATED: LARRY ELDER: Death Threats Against Musk Once Again Shows How Much The Left Values Science)\n\nNow, in the wake of President Trump's monumental 2024 re-election, Trump Derangement Syndrome has mutated into something far more debilitating. This time around, Democrats have decided to adopt the unpopular position of every \"80-20\" public policy issue that comes down the pike, purely out of hatred for President Trump.\n\nInstead of working with Elon Musk and the new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to address our unsustainable $36 trillion national debt by cutting wasteful spending and uncovering fraud, Democrats have decided to ignore America's ominous position . Instead of extending the Trump tax cuts to grow the economy and lower inflation, Democrats support returning to higher taxes. And instead of reforming our broken education system, Democrats are bowing to teacher unions in defense of the low-test score tragedy they created.\n\nPolitics is about addition not subtraction. So, it doesn't take a genius to understand that defending the failed status quo in a country that is thirsty for reform is a recipe for disaster. But that's the strategy the Democrat Party under the leadership of Sen. Chuck Schumer has settled on.\n\nTo be certain, there's never been a more radical left-wing leader in the United States Senate than career politician Schumer. Throughout former President Joe Biden's catastrophic single term in office, former Majority Leader Schumer was more than happy to green light whatever his deep-pocketed socialist benefactors wanted.\n\nFrom the inflation causing $1.9 trillion-dollar American Rescue Act, to the deceitfully named Inflation Reduction Act green new scam, to allowing an illegal alien invasion at our southern border, to ramming through scores of unqualified activist judges, to non-stop phony impeachment witch hunts, to threatening Supreme Court justices, Schumer was always there to do the bidding of the rabid left.\n\nBut as the recent government shutdown drama made perfectly clear, for the Trump-deranged socialist left, their party's leadership can never be destructive enough.\n\nIn a matter of minutes after Chuck Schumer decided not to shut the government down, leftists were pushing hard to depose him. And the calls to remov e Schumer from power persist today, but the agitators are facing a big problem - the Democrats have no talent on their bench to succeed him.\n\nLook no further than the Bernie Sanders-Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez-Jasmine Crockett socialist sideshow the left has decided to roll out around the country.\n\nThe stale astroturf rallies and concocted outrage are proof positive that the Democrat Party is in freefall and the country is wondering just how low they can go. If the criminal attacks on Tesla and the violent rhetoric being directed at Trump, Musk, Sen. Ted Cruz and others are any indication, it looks like we're about to find out.\n\nThe mess on the left is a golden opportunity for President Trump and Congressional Republicans. As the Democrat Party self-destructs, the GOP must stay focused on saving the country with America First common sense.\n\nLeft-wing special interests have put Chuck Schumer on notice that he's not allowed to help in this noble endeavor in any way whatsoever. That's why Republicans must stick together at all costs and get comfortable with getting 90% of what they want.\n\nThe Democrats desperately need Republican legislators to get greedy and splinter, so it's imperative for the GOP majority in Congress to stay unified and pass the most consequential budget reconciliation bill in history in short order.\n\nGetting the reconciliation bill signed into law this spring will position the GOP to grow their majorities in Congress. Realizing President Trump's vision of \"one big beautiful bill\" will spur economic growth and certainty with low taxes and regulations, usher in an era of American energy dominance, drive down prices, fund a secure border for decades to come, and rebuild our military in one fell swoop.\n\nThis is the record of positive results the GOP can take to the American people in 2026 as the Democrats struggle with a prolonged bout of Trump Derangement Syndrome.\n\nDavid Bossie is the president of Citizens United and served as a senior adviser to the Trump-Pence 2020 campaign. In 2016, Bossie served as deputy campaign manager for Donald J. Trump for President and deputy executive director for the Trump-Pence Transition Team.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author and do not reflect the official position of the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "Fmr Clinton Pollster Stumbles When Asked To Name Moderate Democrats, Admits It's A 'Small List'\n\n[Screenshot/Fox News/\"Hannity\"]\n\nFormer Clinton pollster Mark Penn stumbled Wednesday evening on \"Hannity\" when asked to name Democrats he considers \"moderate,\" eventually admitting it was a \"small list.\"\n\nSince President Donald Trump's 2024 victory, the Democrat Party has struggled to regain ground with voters, recently hitting a record-low favorability rating. Fox host Sean Hannity asked Penn whether he believed his party had been \"radicalized\" by the far left and if he could name any remaining moderates, citing Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman as an example.\n\n\"Well, first of all, we're going to have to see what happens in the next presidential primary,\" Penn said. \"I know right now after this defeat, the Democratic Party is leaderless, and AOC and Bernie Sanders are going around and they're trying to, I think, take the party even further to the left when the evidence is the problem with this party is it's too far to the left for America.\"\n\n\"It's got to get back to the center if it ever hopes to get back into government. I think that's the most important lesson here. It's not happening. Jasmine Crockett, AOC, move over. There's a new act in town, a new person who can raise money, a new person who kind of adds to the show of the left,\" Penn added. \"The social media popularity is not the same.\"\n\nA CNN/SSRS poll released March 16 showed Democrats' favorability among voters has dropped 20 points since January 2021, hitting a record low of just 29% approval. A significant portion of the disapproval came from within their own party, with over 30% of respondents unable to name a Democratic leader who \"best reflects the core values\" of the party. RELATED: 'Respect The Competition': Stephen A. Smith Says Left Got Too Comfortable 'Vilifying' And 'Denigrating' Republicans\n\nAmong those who did name someone, Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez led with 10% support, followed by Vice President Kamala Harris at 9%, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders at 8% and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries at 6%. Former President Barack Obama and Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett each received 4%, while Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and a handful of others trailed at 2%.\n\nHannity pushed back on Penn and pointed out that he wasn't answering the question directly. The Fox host then noted how voters had witnessed Democrats' \"groupthink\" during Trump's joint address to Congress on March 4.\n\nWATCH:\n\nDuring the night of the president's speech, Democrats protested Trump in various ways. Democratic Texas Rep. Al Green was removed from the chamber just minutes into the event after attempting to interrupt Trump. Additionally, Democratic lawmakers refused to stand for 13-year-old D.J. Daniel, who was diagnosed with cancer and given an honorary Secret Service agent title during the night.\n\n\"So my question is, give me names. Who would you say is a moderate Democrat today? As many people as you can think of. Go,\" Hannity said.\n\n\"Look, I would definitely like to have seen Josh Shapiro as someone who I thought Harris should have named as vice president. I think he could be a very good centrist candidate,\" Penn said.\n\nHannity interrupted Penn, saying he was \"talking about [people in] Washington'\"and, while Shapiro was a \"fair answer,\" asked if he had any other options.\n\n\"Well, it's a small list right now,\" Penn said. \"Pennsylvania seems to have Fetterman and Josh Shapiro. And we're going to have to wait and see if some others [come].\"\n\nHannity laughed at Penn's response, saying he didn't mean to corner the pollster but that his party's base has \"gone radical left.\"\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Many congressional Democrats are urging Schumer to escalate resistance tactics against the Republican-controlled Senate and refuse to work with GOP lawmakers. (RELATED: 'It's Time For You To Go': CBS Anchors Tell Chuck Schumer Point-Blank His Party No Longer Trusts His Leadership)\n\n\"His [Schumer's] popularity is somewhere between Elon Musk and the Ebola virus,\" a senior House Democrat told Axios.\n\nPelosi previously criticized Schumer's decision to vote for the GOP spending bill to stave off a partial government shutdown, telling the Senate leader he should \"listen to the women\" - the Democratic appropriators - who were offering an alternative funding measure that was a nonstarter for both Senate and House GOP leadership.\n\nFormer Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz took a shot at Schumer on Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom's podcast Tuesday, telling the rumored 2028 presidential candidate that Senate Democratic leadership \"gave up our leverage\" in the government funding clash with GOP lawmakers.\n\nSome congressional Democrats have privately urged New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to launch a primary challenge against Schumer in 2028. Ocasio-Cortez has declined to rule out a Senate bid and has called on Schumer to retire at the end of his current term.\n\n\"Schumer has been in politics for a long time, and I would hope that this is his final term, and he opens it up for someone new,\" Ocasio-Cortez said.\n\nSchumer has consistently defended his decision to back the Trump-backed spending bill, saying that letting government funding lapse would have been worse.\n\n\"The higher you climb, the more fiercely the winds blow,\" Schumer told the Wall Street Journal in an interview on March 14. \"The only thing that keeps you from being blown off the mountain is an internal gyroscope.\"\n\nPelosi reportedly played a prominent role in pressuring former President Joe Biden to drop out of the 2024 presidential race.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "Democrats Turn To 83-Year-Old Communist Bernie Sanders For Image Makeover\n\nSanders has been declared the new face of the Democrat party.\n\nAs we all know, in last November's presidential election, Donald Trump defeated what's-her-name and left Democrats trailing Republicans in popularity by a margin of approximately everybody to nothing. Now, Democrats are trying to find a new way forward that does not involve finding a new way forward. Democrat National Committee Chairman Mao Tse Muhammed Jihad Vladimir Muhammed Allahu Akbar Stalin Jihad Mohammed recently addressed the subject in a speech entitled \"How Can They Hate Us When We're So Hep?\" The Speech was delivered to the annual meeting of the Future Illegal Alien Terrorists Who Hate America of America, or the FIATWHA - and then another A. Mr. Jihad, who goes by the name of Miss Jihad and uses the pronouns He and Be, as in the sentence \"He be giving me the heebee geebees,\" told the gathering, \"It's time to face up to the truth. We Democrats instigated fatal riots and then pretended they weren't happening, we opened our borders to criminals and terrorists and pretended that wasn't happening, we sexually mutilated children in the name of a perverted fantasy, we censored anyone who disagreed with us and tried to put our political opponents in jail, and we acted with such weakness and incompetence overseas that it inspired our enemies to begin wars in both Europe and the Middle East. Now we must ask ourselves, since we're doing everything perfectly according to plan, why the hell doesn't the public love us like they should?\"\n\nIn an attempt to refresh the party's image, the Democrats have turned to 83-year-old Senator Bernie Sanders, a man who lived through the Communist gulags of Russia, the Communist enslavement of Eastern Europe, the Communist slaughter in China, and the Communist genocide in Cambodia without once changing his opinion that Communism works great, especially in Norway, where they don't have it. Sanders has been declared the new face of the Democrat party and has been teamed up with Alexandria Ocasio Cortez who has been declared the new rack of the Democrat party. Asked about this arrangement, Sheldon Whitehouse, the Junior Senator from the State of Unbelievable Corruption, said \"With Bernie Sanders as our new face and AOC as our new rack we will have a hideous old face with a great rack and that's a winning combination because when you have a great rack, no one looks at your face.\"\n\nSanders and AOC have been traveling the country staging what they call the \"Rally in Favor of a Failed Economic System that has led to Enslavement and Mass Murder Wherever it's Been Tried but For Some Reason we still Think Is Great.\"\n\nThe rallies generally open with a ringing speech from Sanders who tells the crowd, \"I happen to believe that billionaires should pay their fair share of utterly useless programs that nonetheless convince poor people to vote for us even as their states and cities descend into apocalyptic dysfunction because of those same programs. I happen to believe that socialism has worked really great, especially in Norway. And I happen to believe that what I happen to believe should happen to matter to every person who happens to care what an octogenarian Communist just happens to believe. And by the way, here's AOC and, golly, will you look at the rack on that woman.\"\n\nWhen Sanders finishes his speech, he turns the microphone over to AOC who says, \"I've come here today to say completely nonsensical things in a loud shrill voice full of make-believe sincerity. All across this country, I see people left behind by capitalism for no other reason than that they don't work or contribute to society in any way. It isn't fair. Well, okay, it actually is kind of fair, but it isn't right. And even if it is right, I think there are enough total wastrels who feel entitled to a portion of the wealth created by other people that we might have enough votes to turn this country around. And hey, my eyes are up here. Why aren't you looking in my eyes?\"\n\nSo far the rallies have been filled with thousands of cheering people, most of them Republicans who feel they'll never lose an election again.\n\n* * *\n\nThis excerpt is taken from the opening satirical monologue of \" The Andrew Klavan Show .\"\n\nThe views expressed in this satirical article are those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of The Daily Wire.\n\nAndrew Klavan is the host of \"The Andrew Klavan Show\" at The Daily Wire.

      "text": "Democrats Reveal How They Will Change The Rules To Take Back Power\n\nThey're going all-in on a supreme court race that's taking place on Tuesday in Wisconsin.\n\nWe have now established, about a million different ways, that Democrats have no intention of learning anything substantive from their defeat in November. First there was the disastrous meeting to select new leadership at the DNC, which resembled a bad \"American Idol\" audition more than anything else. The various non-binary and BIPOC candidates spent all of their time singing and complaining about how oppressed they are, instead of reflecting in any way on how they just lost the election. Then Democrats encouraged a domestic terror campaign against Tesla, which is obviously a surefire way to demonstrate your commitment to a stable, functioning democracy. And on top of that, Democrats also decided to go to federal court on behalf of Venezuelan terrorists who had just been deported, because as we all know, that's what swing voters are really passionate about.\n\nIt would be a pretty significant understatement to say that this is not a winning strategy for the next election. To any objective observer, Democrats are acting like a party that badly wants to go extinct. But of course, Democrats have no intention of going extinct. Their sole purpose is obtaining as much power as possible. So it's worth asking - as we watch Democrats double down on every single one of their policy positions from the last election cycle - what exactly their plan is, going forward. If they don't intend to appeal to voters, what are they going to do? How are they going to regain power?\n\nRecently the Democrats' leader in the House, Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), answered that question. Because Hakeem Jeffries is one of those people who's simply too dumb to keep a secret, we have this footage that makes one thing very clear: Democrats do not intend to persuade voters based on ideas or policies or anything like that. That's not a major part of their strategy. Instead, Democrats intend to change the rules. That is the winning strategy they've settled on.\n\nSpecifically, they're going all-in on a supreme court race that's taking place on Tuesday in Wisconsin. If Democrats win the race, they'll retain control of the Wisconsin Supreme Court. And then, Democrats intend to use the Wisconsin Supreme Court to redraw congressional districts in the state so that more Democrats are elected, which (if successful) could ultimately swing control of the House of Representatives to the Democrat Party. So this is a state-wide race that will have major implications for the entire country. Watch Hakeem Jeffries explain.\n\nThat's one of the creepier uses of the word \"enlightened\" you'll ever hear. The Supreme Court of Wisconsin needs to be \"enlightened,\" says Hakeem Jeffries. And by that he means, the Supreme Court should be composed of Left-wing operatives who will do everything in their power to benefit the Democrat Party. This is how Democrats think about judges in every context.\n\nRepublicans select judges who will be \"faithful to the law,\" supposedly, which inevitably means that they routinely betray conservative principles and vote with Democrats half the time. Democrats, on the other hand, select judges who vote in lockstep with their party. That's what they've done in the U.S. Supreme Court. And it's what they're doing in Wisconsin, as well.\n\nIf you're confused about exactly what Jeffries is talking about, I'll try to explain the general idea. Democrats are claiming that Republicans have gerrymandered Wisconsin's congressional districts, by drawing the districts in an artificial way so that Democrats are only capable of winning two districts out of eight total in the state. In other words, they're saying that the districts are currently drawn so that all of the Democrat voters are jammed into two districts. And now Democrats are promising to use the Supreme Court to redraw those districts, in such a way as to guarantee that Democrat voters are spread across more districts. In the end, the goal is to seat more Democrats in the House of Representatives, and unseat Mike Johnson (R-LA) and the Republicans from power.\n\nOne of the many problems here is that Wisconsin's congressional districts, as they stand right now, are completely reasonable. There is no reason to redraw them, unless you're trying to find some artificial way to get more Democrats in office. Here's an image of what the districts look like at the moment:\n\nWikimedia Commons.\n\nAs you can see, the Milwaukee and Madison areas, in the southern portion of the state, each have their own district. And those are the two congressional districts that Democrats control at the moment - Districts 2 and 4.\n\nIf you compare that district map to the results in Wisconsin from the last presidential election, you'll immediately notice the problems that Democrats have. Take a look at this:\n\nWikimedia Commons.\n\nAs you can see, the overwhelming number of counties in the state are Republican. Pretty much all of them voted for Trump. Democrats' strongest base of support in Wisconsin is in the southern portion of the state by far - in places like Milwaukee and Madison. Those are the urban centers, so that makes sense. This is why Republicans have control of six out of the eight districts in Wisconsin, even though Donald Trump defeated Kamala Harris in Wisconsin by less than 1%. The Democrat voters happen to be extremely concentrated in these two places, and each of these two places is represented by a distinct congressional district.\n\nIn order to accomplish the results that Democrats like Hakeem Jeffries want - which is something like a 50-50 split in the congressional districts - you'd need to start carving up Districts 2 and 4. There's simply no other way to do it, given that the rest of the state is reliably conservative. That's what Democrats will have the Wisconsin Supreme Court do, if they win the election on Tuesday. Milwaukee and Madison would be divided in various illogical and arbitrary ways.\n\nBut this isn't how congressional districts are supposed to work. Congressional districts aren't supposed to be drawn so that they produce the same results as statewide elections. They're supposed to be drawn to give a voice to the specific needs of various districts - including rural areas, which don't have a lot in common with cities like Milwaukee. It's a similar reason why we have the Electoral College (which of course, Democrats are also trying to abolish). We want congressional districts to reflect the unique nature of a particular area. That's the whole point of them.\n\nBut for many years now, Democrats in Wisconsin have attempted to use redistricting for a very different purpose. And they've been having a lot of success. In late 2023, Democrats in Wisconsin installed a judge on the state supreme court who had openly campaigned on the platform of redrawing the state's electoral maps for state and local elections. This is apparently the kind of thing that judges do in Wisconsin; they tell voters how they'll decide cases, once they become a judge. That judge won, and indeed, the maps for state-level elections were ultimately redrawn. And the results were immediate.\n\nIn the November election - which, again, Donald Trump won in Wisconsin - Democrats flipped 14 state Senate and Assembly seats in Wisconsin.\n\nYes, in an election where the Republican candidate for president was victorious in the state-wide vote in Wisconsin, Republicans nevertheless suffered major losses in the state government. And without any irony whatsoever, Democrats celebrated this outcome as a major victory for democracy. And now that they've rigged the state-wide districts, Democrats are taking aim at Wisconsin's federal congressional districts, so that they can retake the House and obstruct Donald Trump in Congress.\n\nIt's not just Hakeem Jeffries who's admitting this. I watched a little bit of the debate between Brad Schimel, the Republican candidate for this Supreme Court seat, and Susan Crawford, the Democrat candidate. It turns out that Crawford received an email invitation for an event about how she can help Democrats gain two seats in the House of Representatives. And then she attended the event via Zoom. Watch how she tried to explain this:\n\nThis is the level of corruption and shamelessness that Democrats are bringing to this race. Their candidate for the Wisconsin supreme court gets caught attending a planning session for how she's going to use her position - as a supposedly nonpartisan judge who follows the law - to help Democrats in the House. And then she lies about it during a televised debate. And somehow, she's ahead in the polls.\n\nI watched some more of this debate, and she rattles off the usual lies about abortion, and how important it is for women to be able to murder their children for any reason. Then she lies about \"heartbeat bills\" and so on. She is, in every respect, an atrocious candidate. She is acting exactly like a generic Democrat partisan operative, because that's exactly what she is. Republicans simply should not lose this race.\n\nBut at the moment, roughly 95% of Kamala Harris voters are backing Crawford, while only around 87% of Trump voters are supporting Schimel. That needs to change between now and Tuesday, or else Crawford will win. And that could potentially be a disaster for Republicans at the national level, at least in the short term.\n\nIt's worth ending on a note of optimism here. Regardless of what happens in Wisconsin, it looks like Democrats' representation in the House of Representatives is going to decline significantly by 2030, when the next Census kicks in.\n\nthearp.org\n\nThat's because, as this map demonstrates, people are leaving states like California, New York and Illinois. And they're flooding into states like Texas and Florida. Democrats have forced millions of people to leave the states they've mismanaged. And that affects representation in the House, which is based on population - whether those residents are legal or illegal. On balance, that likely means that Republicans will pick up around 12 seats in the House by 2030. That's more than three times the size of the GOP's current majority. And because the Trump administration is sharply cutting down on the number of illegal aliens in this country, it's going to be difficult for Democrats to compensate by flooding the zone with foreign nationals.\n\nIn other words, the broader indicators for conservatives are very strong right now. Democrats are doubling down on their most insane and alienating positions. And they're resorting to gerrymandering, and promoting judges who are obviously corrupt, in an attempt to claw back a couple of House seats. But whether Democrats win those seats or not, the fact remains that Democrats' constituency is shrinking by the day. That's also why they lost the popular vote in the last election, to their great shock and horror. No matter how much lawfare these people engage in, it remains true that, in this country, voters - not judges - have the power.\n\nWhat we're seeing is that Democrats - both in Wisconsin and in Washington - apparently believe otherwise. They think judges get to run the executive branch, just like they think judges get to award Democrats another two seats in the House of Representatives. But on Tuesday, with the entire country watching, voters in the state of Wisconsin have an opportunity to prove them wrong. For the sake of the rule of law in this country, and for the Republicans' control of the House, let's hope they do so.\n\nContinue reading this exclusive article and join the conversation, plus watch free videos on DW+\n\nAlready a member?

      "text": "'They're Rudderless': Sen. Blackburn On Democrats, DOGE, And Domestic Terrorism\n\nBlackburn tells Morning Wire, \"They have no message, no messenger, no designated leaders.\"\n\nThe following is a distilled and edited transcript of an interview between Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief John Bickley and Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) on a weekend edition of Morning Wire .\n\nAs Tesla owners face escalating attacks and the Biden-era federal budget balloons, Senator Marsha Blackburn says Americans are witnessing the backlash to Republican efficiency reforms and shrinking government. In a recent Morning Wire interview with Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief John Bickley, Senator Blackburn outlines why the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is under fire, and why she believes Democrats are \"rudderless\" and losing their grip on power.\n\n* * *\n\nJohn Bickley: Senator, you're bringing a resolution to the Senate floor that condemns attacks on Tesla. What prompted that move?\n\nSenator Marsha Blackburn: It's stunning that we're seeing these violent attacks-vandalism, destruction of private property, even firebombings-and yet Democratic leadership is not standing up and calling out these acts of domestic terrorism. This resolution says the U.S. Senate stands against those acts of violence. Whether it's Tesla dealerships, electric car owners, or charging stations being targeted, it's unacceptable. So we think this resolution is appropriate. We want to give members of the U.S. Senate from each party, along with a couple of independents, the opportunity to stand up and say, \"We condemn these attacks.\"\n\nBickley: Elon Musk has suggested there's big money and coordination behind these protests. Are you seeing evidence that this isn't just grassroots chaos?\n\nSen. Blackburn: Yes. What we've heard - and what Musk has highlighted - is that this is something that is quite organized. We know they're planning a so-called \"Global Day of Action\" against Tesla. The reasoning behind it is telling: it's about their hatred for Donald Trump, their disdain for Elon Musk, and opposition to DOGE - the Department of Government Efficiency - which Musk helped establish in partnership with Congress. That's the real target. Leftists need big government in order to survive. That's their mother's milk, if you will. These activist organizations can't survive on their own - so when we start rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal system, they become distraught. DOGE is cutting off the pipeline of taxpayer money that's been flowing into these nonprofits.\n\nBickley: What kind of waste are we talking about here?\n\nSen. Blackburn: The Biden administration handed out billions to organizations that have no ability to stand on their own. I'll give you one example: Stacey Abrams' so-called \"climate justice\" nonprofit had about $100 in the bank, but somehow received $2 billion in federal money - that's billion with a \"B.\" That's not just wasteful, it's offensive to taxpayers. All that money needs to be clawed back. It should go back to the U.S. Treasury and used to pay down our $36 trillion in debt. Then, we need to codify those cuts, making them permanent through rescission bills and reconciliation processes. That's how we get to a balanced budget again. Right now we're at $7.3 trillion. Trump's target is $5.5 trillion.\n\nBickley: What specifically will the Senate do to make DOGE reforms permanent?\n\nSen. Blackburn: You'll see us move quickly on a reconciliation bill to make the Trump 2017 tax cuts permanent. That's step one. But just as important, we're planning a rescission bill that includes DOGE's spending reductions. That's the mechanism for cutting these funds out of the federal budget baseline. The beauty of the rescission process is that it only requires 51 votes in the Senate, not 60. That gives us a real path to codify these cuts. We're aiming to get back to pre-COVID levels of spending.\n\nYuri Gripas/Abaca/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nBickley: Final question. We've seen a lot of pressure mounting on Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Do you foresee a real shakeup with the Democrats in the near future?\n\nSen. Blackburn: I don't think Chuck Schumer's going anywhere. They've gone so far Left, however, that even their base is frustrated. If you look at the issues Americans care about - securing the border, deporting criminal illegal aliens, restoring law and order, getting men out of women's sports, balancing the budget - these are 80/20 issues. Eighty percent of the people are in favor while 20% are opposed. But the Democrats are on the wrong side of every one of them. They oppose everything that's being done to secure the border and deport criminal illegal aliens and get inflation down and get men out of women's sports. The list goes on and on. So, they're rudderless. They have no message, no messenger, no designated leaders. They're pretty much out of the game.\n\nBickley: Senator Blackburn, thank you for your time.\n\nSen. Blackburn: Thanks. Always good to join you.\n\n* * *\n\nCatch the full interview on Morning Wire .\n\nContinue reading this exclusive article and join the conversation, plus watch free videos on DW+\n\nAlready a member?

      "text": "Morning Brief: Dems' Downward Spiral, Wisconsin Supreme Court Race, And Security Shakeup\n\nA quick round-up of the news you need to know.\n\nDemocrats find themselves facing angry voters as a massive rift opens up between the far-Left and the party's more moderate members. President Donald Trump and his top donor, Elon Musk, draw national attention to what could prove to be a pivotal battle for control of Wisconsin's Supreme Court. And Trump revokes the security clearances of a number of Biden allies, while ICE and the IRS prepare to team up.\n\nIt's Monday, and this is the news you need to know to start your week. If you'd rather listen to your news, today's edition of the Morning Wire podcast can be heard below:\n\n(Photo by wildpixel via Getty Images)\n\nTopline: Democratic lawmakers have found themselves confronted by angry constituents as the party searches for a unifying message amid rampant infighting. Meanwhile, new polling shows Democrats continue to be less popular than ever before.\n\nHistorically, there's often a sort of buyer's remorse with voters, where a president's approval ratings will start to decline quickly, and the opposition party will become more popular - b ut that has not happened. Trump's approval ratings have held steady at around 48% - well above where he stood during his first term - and Democratic popularity has only plummeted since Election Day. Last week, CNN found that just 29% of Americans view the party favorably - that's a 20-point drop from 2021. And over the weekend, things got even worse.\n\nA new Quinnipiac poll showed that just 21% of Americans approve of Democrats' job performance in Congress - the lowest mark in the poll's history - and only 40% of Democrats approve of the job their leaders are doing in Congress. By contrast, Congressional Republicans are more popular today than ever, with a 40% approval rating.\n\nDemocrats appear torn between two differing visions of the party's strategy going forward.\n\nThere are those who say the party needs to listen to its left-wing base and double down on their opposition to Trump, doing everything possible to prevent his agenda from being implemented. In that camp is Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), who kicked off a \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour last week with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), hitting Tempe, Las Vegas, and Denver in recent days and drawing crowds in the tens of thousands.\n\n\"We are going to fight Trump and his oligarchic friends,\" Sanders said. \"But we have got to do something else. We have got to ourselves have a vision for the kind of country we want to become.\"\n\nOn the other side are Democrats who feel November's results were a clear rebuke of progressive ideologies and governance. They say the party has to shake the \"woke\" label and moderate on social issues while embracing a more old-school Blue Dog Democrat approach. Leading the charge on that front is, ironically, California's Gavin Newsom, one of the nation's most far-Left Governors. Newsom launched a new podcast where he's been having friendly chats with hardline conservatives like Steve Bannon and Charlie Kirk. He's openly criticized his party as being elitist and out of touch while conceding that he understands why folks supported Trump in November. He even went as far as saying he opposes trans-identifying males in women's sports and called on Democrats to stop using gender-neutral language like \"Latinx,\" although he has used that term many times in the past.\n\nThe Democratic base appears to be as divided as their leadership - the latest numbers from Gallup found that 45% of Democrats want the party to become more moderate, while 29% say they should be more liberal, and 22% want to hold course.\n\nRACINE, WISCONSIN - MARCH 23: Dane County Circuit Court Judge Susan Crawford, candidate for the Wisconsin Supreme Court (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nTopline: An upcoming election will determine whether liberals or conservatives control Wisconsin's top court. Already the most expensive judicial race in United States history, analysts are calling it the first referendum on Trump's presidency.\n\nNext week, a midwestern election will offer a rare chance to flip the ideological balance of the highest court in a key swing state. Depending on how things play out on April 1 st , Wisconsin's Supreme Court could go from a 4-3 liberal majority to a 4-3 conservative one, which would have several ramifications on national policy.\n\nThe balance of power could play a significant role in Wisconsin's congressional districting. After the 2020 census, Republicans - who controlled the legislature - drew Wisconsin's congressional maps. Democrats said this was gerrymandering and sued. In 2022, the liberal court threw out the GOP's maps and adopted ones drawn by Governor Tony Evers, a Democrat. That new map helped Democrats flip one congressional seat in 2024. If conservative candidate Brad Schimel wins, he will likely uphold GOP-drawn maps that help cement that very slim margin Republicans have in the House right now. On the other hand, if liberal Susan Crawford wins, the court is likely to strike down the Republican maps again, meaning Democrats will have a greater likelihood of winning more seats in the state.\n\n\"The congressional majority is so razor thin, it could cause the house to switch to Democrat if federal redrawing takes place,\" Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest man and the mastermind behind DOGE (the Department of Government Efficiency), said on X , the platform formerly known as Twitter. \" Then we won't be able to get through the changes that the American people want.\"\n\nRepublicans also see a conservative court in Wisconsin as a potential firewall that could shield Trump's policies from state-level challenges - think lawsuits over federal overreach or immigration crackdowns. On Truth Social yesterday, Trump called Crawford a \"Radical Left Democrat\" who is \"insistent on bringing hardened CRIMINALS, that we removed to far away places, back into our Country, allowing men into women's sports, [and] Open Borders.\"\n\n(Photo by Douglass Rissing via Getty Images)\n\nTopline: Immigration authorities may soon receive help from the IRS to confirm the identities of illegal aliens. Reports of the new agreement come as thousands of law enforcement officials are expected to be redirected toward President Trump's mass deportation agenda.\n\nThe IRS and ICE are near an agreement that would essentially allow immigration agents to cross-check information on aliens with IRS databases - that's according to The New York Times . To be clear, DHS would not have access to IRS systems, but agents would be able to verify with the IRS whether the home addresses agents have for illegal aliens are correct. The Trump administration has tried before to get the IRS to help locate illegals, but the agency has always resisted because of the sensitivity of taxpayer information - and because it didn't want to run afoul of federal law. This way, the IRS can keep complete control over its taxpayer database.\n\nIllegal immigrants are often employed in the United States and file tax returns that include information such as where they live, who they work for, and their income. The IRS has long encouraged illegal aliens to pay taxes; the agency even has a separate nine-digit code called an individual taxpayer identification number that it will give to aliens in place of a Social Security number.\n\nMore generally, the Department of Homeland Security is in the middle of a massive reshuffle to focus resources on deportations, according to reporting by Reuters . The Trump administration has also canceled the CHNV parole program, which allowed 30,000 immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela to apply for entry to the United States. Trump ended the program on his first day in office, but over the weekend, DHS issued an order revoking legal status for those aliens who entered the country through it. The order encourages them to self-deport within 30 days or risk deportation.\n\nIn other news, President Trump officially revoked the security clearances of a number of people on Friday, including top Biden administration officials, as well as some of the president's top antagonists - those who brought and supported the court cases he faced during the election and who pushed Russian collusion conspiracies. Some of the most prominent names on that list include former President Joe Biden, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, New York Attorney General Letitia James, and former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney (WY).\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

      "text": "The Democrats' 2028 Frontrunner Is ... AOC?!\n\nIt is not a coincidence that Sanders is tapping Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on the shoulder.\n\nDemocrats have a serious problem. President Trump's approval ratings maintain their status, hovering somewhere close to 50%, which is higher than they have been in nearly his entire political career.\n\nHis main policies are quite popular, ranging from crackdowns on illegal immigration - which is a very popular position - to his positions with regard to DOGE. Most Americans favor cutting waste, fraud, and abuse, and Democrats really don't know how to deal with it.\n\nThe Democrats have missed governance at nearly every level of government. Meanwhile, President Trump is moving incredibly fast, making it very difficult for the Democrats to figure out what the point of differentiation is. Where do they want to put their chips? Where is the line of attack they can use against President Trump going to be?\n\nPolitical commentator Matthew Continetti has put forward a rule, which I think is exactly right: If you are trying to scope out the future candidates of any party, the going rule for the last several decades has been that the successful presidential candidate first runs against his or her own party, and then runs for the presidency.\n\nPresident Trump is an excellent example of this. He came in 2016. He ran against every aspect of the Republican Party. He broke the Republican Party, and then he took the presidency. Barack Obama did this in 2008. He overcame Hillary Clinton (who was considered the establishment pick), took over the party, and then won.\n\nThere are a few angles that could be used to take over the Democratic Party. The first (and better) administrative angle would suggest that the federal government is actually good at certain things and then should get a lot of regulations out of the way so the government can build things again, like a Hoover Dam, affordable housing, or a bullet train.\n\nOne problem for Democrats is that they have a very bad record of administration, as demonstrated by places like New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Detroit. That's problem number one.\n\nProblem number two is that most of the Democratic hard-core does not care about any of that. They care more deeply about the \"moral issues\" in the country, rather than caring deeply about being good at administration. They don't understand that being a good administrator on the local or state level actually does have a moral component, because if you wish to alleviate poverty, for example, one of the best ways is to provide a stable and useful local government.\n\nBut Democrats have stopped believing that to be true, so they are left with a couple of other angles.\n\nOne is the DEI angle: that the Democratic Party stands for recentering the marginalized. This is the attempt to elevate candidates of color (see: Kamala Harris) or elevating people on the basis of sexual orientation (see: Pete Buttigieg, who is gay) to a presidential candidacy at the expense of other candidates who might be better qualified.\n\nThere's a lot of support for that inside the Democratic Party. That is the angle they've been taking, and it has been failing. Democrats may double down on stupid. If they do, they're unlikely to win back the presidency.\n\nThe Democratic establishment has failed the Democratic Party and they know it, which is why Chuck Schumer is under serious fire right now.\n\nSo, what are Democrats left with?\n\nThe Bernie-Sanders' wing.\n\nHe's too old. He's not going to be the guy. Nevertheless, the Bernie-Sanders' energy is the insurgent energy inside the Democratic Party - energy that is full-scale class warfare. DEI has been played out. So, they are reverting to the original Marxism from race or sex Marxism.\n\nThis is the direction of the Democratic Party. This is where the energy is.\n\nAnd this is exactly what the Trump administration should be concerned about. The Trump administration has to be exceptionally good at what it does. If they fail, the next thing up on the Democratic side of the aisle is Sanders and whomever he (an 83-year-old lifelong, useless leech on the rear of society) taps on the shoulder.\n\nIt is not a coincidence that Sanders is tapping Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez - who is appearing with him at rallies - on the shoulder. Sanders is abandoning certain issues that are tent-pole Democrat issues right now and focusing on pure class warfare.\n\nSanders is running around because he knows that he's being asked to create a war inside the party. What he actually wants is for AOC to run for president.\n\nMeanwhile, she is positioning herself against an establishment Democratic Party that is unwilling to face up to the challenges of President Trump, which is smart.\n\nThe goal right now for Democrats is very simple: to steer into full-scale class warfare.\n\nThere's a reason they keep using the word \"oligarchy.\" What they're attempting to do is craft a narrative about a group of people at the top of government, in private industry and the public sector, working together to corrupt the system.\n\nThe typical comeback to that from the conservative side of the aisle is, \"If the economy is booming, what are you complaining about?\"\n\nBut the reason the class warfare argument is clever is because of the way that people tend to filter politics. We talk about politics every day on my show , and if you listen to the show, you're a member of a tiny group in the American public who watch politics at a fairly granular level. You know the players and the general arguments.\n\nBut the vast majority of  people in the United States have a picture of politics that is significantly less granular.\n\nGeorges Seurat was a famous Impressionist painter. He created paintings by using thousands of dots. People who watch politics closely are like people who view a Seurat painting up close and see every single dot, every pixel.\n\nBut if you draw back from a Seurat painting, you see the painting is a picture of something. Most people wander into a room with a Seurat painting, observe the painting as people who are walking by a river, and then walk out of the room. They do not analyze a granular view.\n\nSo Democrats are counting on people seeing a picture of President Trump at the inauguration, flanked by Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, Tim Cook, Sundar Pichai, Neal Mohan, and all the other tech CEOs in a room together, with a bird's-eye view - not a granular view.\n\nWhat the Democrats are banking on is a close coordination between private industry and the president - and then for the economy to fail.\n\nAnd if there's an economic fall, AOC is right there, and so is Bernie.\n\nLet's be clear about what the threat level is: It is serious. This is why the economy must succeed.\n\nThe greatest danger to the Trump administration is an economic downturn. Anything else can be overcome. An economic downturn gets attributed to the president who is the president when it happens, whether or not he deserves it. That's just the way it works.\n\nTherefore, that is the great danger.\n\nThis White House being very friendly toward business is great. That is wonderful. But every image showing how friendly this White House is toward business becomes a weapon in the arsenal of people like AOC, who doesn't understand business, doesn't understand economics, truly hates the rich, and thinks there's an immoral quality that adheres to you as you gain wealth and makes you immoral and bad.\n\nThat's a Marxist sentiment that makes no sense on a moral level. Pretty much everyone I know who was at one point not rich and then became rich is the same person they always were.\n\nI know many people who are wonderful and are not rich. I know many people who are wonderful and are rich. I know many people who are awful and are rich. I know many people who are awful and are not rich.\n\nWealth does not define character.\n\nBut for people like Sanders and AOC, there's a flattering view they can present to the vast majority of Americans, which is that if you are rich, it's because you suckered someone and did something wrong or corrupt; further, they contend that participating in the capitalist system makes you morally inferior in some way.\n\nThat's why Sanders will say billionaires should not exist. He doesn't just mean we should redistribute wealth. He means there is something immoral in being a billionaire.\n\nBut people tend to judge politics that way: walking through the room, looking once at the painting, and walking out.\n\nIf they observe the White House as being close to various industrial capitalists and tech bros who are and have been successful, and then the economy sinks, all will be tied to the sinking ship.\n\nWhich is why it is imperative that the Trump administration not let the economic ship sink.\n\nContinue reading this exclusive article and join the conversation, plus watch free videos on DW+\n\nAlready a member?

      "text": "45 Senate Democrats Kill Legislation Keeping Men Out Of Women's Sports\n\nOn Monday, 45 Senate Democrats effectively killed federal legislation aimed at preventing trans-identifying males from unfairly competing against female athletes. The party-line vote was 51-45, with Sens. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., and Peter Welch, D-Vt, not voting.\n\n\"45 Democratic Senators voted NO on Protecting Women & Girls in Sports,\" former NCAA swimmer Riley Gaines wrote on X. \"Never, ever let them gaslight you into thinking Democrats care about 'women's rights'...\"\n\nKnown as the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act of 2025 , the proposed legislation sought to alter the Education Amendments of 1972 by making it unlawful for entities who receive federal dollars and facilitate, operate, and/or sponsor \"athletic programs or activities to permit a person whose sex is male to participate in an athletic program or activity that is designated for women or girls.\" The bill specifies that sex \"shall be recognized based solely on a person's reproductive biology and genetics at birth.\"\n\nMonday's procedural vote required support from at least 60 senators to move the bill forward to a final vote in the Senate. A companion measure previously passed (218-206) in the House of Representatives in January, with only two Democrats voting alongside all Republicans in support.\n\nThe bill seemingly sought to codify protections included in an executive order signed by Trump last month. That directive vowed to strip federal funding for educational programs that allow woman-pretending males to compete against female athletes.\n\nAccording to the New York Post , a recent New York Times/Ipsos poll found that the vast majority of Americans (79 percent) - including two-thirds of self-identified Democrats or leaning-Democrats (67 percent) - believe that men who identify as women should not be allowed to participate in female athletics.\n\n[READ: NCAA Had The Power To Keep Men Out Of Women's Sports This Whole Time ]\n\nResponding to Monday's vote, Senate bill sponsor and Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., noted how \"at least now the American people know the truth\" about where Democrats stand when it comes to protecting female athletes.\n\n\"Even after @realdonaldtrump's landslide election, Democrats STILL support men competing in women's sports,\" Tuberville wrote on X. \"This is far from over. I'll NEVER stop fighting to protect women and girls.\"\n\nIncidents exposing the dangers and unfairness of allowing trans-identifying men to participate in women's sports have generated nationwide attention in recent years.\n\nLast year, for example, numerous collegiate women's volleyball teams forfeited matches against San Jose State University to protest the allowed participation of SJSU's Blaire Fleming, a trans-identifying male.\n\nVideo of SJSU's match against San Diego State University in October reportedly showed Fleming spiking the ball in the face of his female opponent. According to the New York Post , the female player \"was knocked down after the hit, and the crowd audibly gasped.\"\n\nFleming and SJSU ultimately lost the Mountain West Conference championship game to Colorado State.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "Democrats Break With Decades-Long Tradition Of Denying Elections To Certify Electoral College For Trump\n\nThe last time Democrats did not challenge the results of a GOP presidential victory was at the certification of George H.W. Bush's win in 1988.\n\nA joint session of Congress officially certified President-elect Donald Trump's election win on Jan. 6, and for the first time since 1988, no Democrat challenged the legitimacy of a Republican being elected president.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., presided over the session, where 312 electoral votes were certified in favor of Trump and Vice President-elect J.D. Vance in a session that lasted about 30 minutes. The states being certified in alphabetical order, Texas's 40 electoral votes ultimately put Trump and Vance over the 270-vote threshold at 289.\n\nThe lack of Democrat-led drama in the certification of the election of a Republican president broke the party's decades-long tradition of denying the results of elections, as they had done in 2000, 2004, and 2016. The last time Democrats did not challenge the results of a GOP presidential victory was at the certification of George H.W. Bush's win in 1988.\n\nPrior to the certification, Harris released a video saying, \"Today, I will perform my constitutional duty as Vice President to certify the results of the 2024 election. This duty is a sacred obligation - one I will uphold guided by love of country, loyalty to our Constitution, and unwavering faith in the American people.\"\n\nHowever, Democrats in the past have made baseless claims about Republicans winning elections, some of which have been fueled by their anger at losing the Electoral College vote while winning the popular vote - which does not affect presidential elections.\n\nIn the 2001 certification, Democrats claimed that President George W. Bush had been \"selected, not elected\" by the U.S. Supreme Court after the Bush v. Gore decision. Multiple Democrats presented challenges to the counting of Florida's electoral votes, including former Rep. Alcee Hastings, D-Fla., who said that there was \"overwhelming evidence of official misconduct, deliberate fraud, and an attempt to suppress voter turnout.\"\n\nFormer Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, claimed there were \"millions of Americans who have been disenfranchised by Florida's inaccurate vote count,\" and Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said Florida's electoral votes were \"fraudulent.\"\n\nAlthough no senators joined the Democrat House members in 2001 (at that time federal law mandated that a least one senator and one representative object for a challenge to be considered), by the 2005 certification, former Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., and former Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones, D-Ohio, joined forces to formally object to Ohio's electoral votes, despite the fact that Bush won the state by over 100,000 votes.\n\nFormer Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., said that \"the democratic process was thwarted,\" Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., claimed that voting rights were \"stolen,\" and Waters issued an objection as well. Ultimately, 31 House members and Boxer voted to reject the will of Ohio's voters.\n\nPerhaps the greatest show of force from Democrats attempting to thwart elections took place in 2017, when the electors from nine states faced objections and Democrats like Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., advanced wild conspiracy theories about \"the confirmed and illegal activities engaged by the government of Russia.\"\n\nNumerous Democrats falsely claimed that Russia had altered the outcome of the election, one of the key falsehoods of the Russia collusion hoax . Barbara Lee at the time challenged Michigan's electoral votes because she claimed that \"people are horrified by the overwhelming evidence of Russian interference in our elections.\" She also pointed to \"the malfunction of 87 voting machines.\"\n\nLast week, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., boasted in his speaker election speech that Democrats believe in election outcomes, but on numerous occasions he attempted to deny the results of the 2016 election, saying of Trump, \"history will never accept you as a legitimate president.\"\n\nIn other social media posts, Jeffries claimed, \"The more we learn about the 2016 election the more ILLEGITIMATE it becomes. America deserves to know whether we have a FAKE President in the Oval Office #RussianInterference.\" He also wrote in 2018, \"LIE (more than any administration in the history of the Republic). CHEAT (2016 election/Russian interference). STEAL (one or two Supreme Court seats).\"\n\nWhat remains unanswered, however, is how many Democrats will boycott Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, as so many of them did in 2017 because they denied the results of the election.\n\nAt that time, more than 60 Democrats skipped the inauguration in protest of Trump's win, including election deniers Hastings, Waters, Nadler, and Barbara Lee, led by former Rep. John Lewis.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media. All rights reserved."

      "text": "Democrats Should Definitely Keep Picking Fights They Can't Win\n\nDemocrats have apparently decided that in place of advocating policies that might actually help Americans, they're simply going to scream \"No!\" to everything President Trump does and hope something happens.\n\nIt's obviously working to stunning effect. And by \"working,\" I mean continuing to expose how deeply irrelevant they're making themselves.\n\nThe latest episode came Saturday when James Boasberg, a D.C. district judge appointed by Obama, decided it was a good time for a constitutional showdown and told the administration he's not sure it has the authority to deport alleged foreign gang members illegally residing in the U.S. Boasberg ordered deportation flights to return, and the White House responded by effectively telling him to check himself. \"A single judge in a single city cannot direct the movements of an aircraft carrying foreign alien terrorists who were physically expelled from U.S. soil,\" said administration Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt.\n\nAs of Monday, we don't really know how this will end up, but it raises the question: When are Democrats going to contribute something useful? Flexing on the president for the sake of it isn't getting them anywhere, as we just saw with the ridiculous funding fight that Democrats are still smarting over because some in their own party did the inevitable and agreed to keep the government open with more money.\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi chose to vote against the funding bill and called it a \"false choice,\" when what she really meant was \"a choice I didn't like.\" A false choice is a logical fallacy in which more options are available than what is being presented. There were in fact only two options for Democrats: vote to keep the government open or don't. That either outcome would be advantageous for the White House - a shutdown would essentially give Trump the authority to zero out whatever federal agencies he wanted - may have been politically frustrating for Democrats, but it's no one's fault but theirs\n\nThey're the ones turning every step of government business into unnecessary drama. And that's only when they're not forcing everyone to confront the reality that orders on the executive branch from the judiciary are only valid to the extent that they can be enforced. Last I checked, the D.C. district court doesn't have an army.\n\nIs that something we need to constantly revisit? We can, though that's going to make for a very long four years.\n\nOr maybe they could stop picking fights that they either can't win or that require the country to once again consider just how fragile our republic remains. It would be very easy to break. Democrats act like they're interested in finding out what happens if it does.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "If Anyone Believes In 'Replacement Theory,' It's Democrats Who Think Voters Are Stupid\n\nDemocrats have been bragging that 'demographics is destiny' for years. But a more diverse electorate isn't voting the way they'd hoped.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the massacre in Buffalo, New York, where a deranged white supremacist killed 10 people, elite opinion quickly settled on the real culprit: Republicans.\n\nThe New York Times spelled it out explicitly in an editorial this week, claiming Republican politicians and conservative commentators like Tucker Carlson, \"openly espouse versions of a white supremacist conspiracy theory holding that an orchestrated effort is underway to displace white Americans.\"\n\nThe Times is of course referring to so-called \"replacement theory,\" the idea that global elites are trying to \"replace\" white Americans with immigrants and foreigners, which the Times thinks is a common belief among Republicans . Not to be outdone by the Times, the Washington Post's editors on Monday declared , \"what was once on the fringes has now been given currency, thanks to the Republican Party's tolerance of white nationalists who count themselves as part of its base.\"\n\nThe notion that \"replacement theory\" is mainstream on the right, much less in the GOP, is of course abject nonsense. But the accusation serves a purpose. By conflating the conspiracy theories of maniacs like the Buffalo shooter with legitimate calls for, say, border security and controls on illegal immigration, the left can smear all Republicans as white supremacists.\n\nDoing so serves a useful purpose for Democrats. If Republicans are the party of people who believe global elites are trying to \"replace\" white Americans with immigrants and foreigners, then any calls to fix our immigration system or solve the ongoing crisis at the border must be in bad faith, nothing more than rank racism thinly disguised as a respectable-sounding immigration agenda.\n\nIt also serves Democrats in another way: it helps mask an electoral agenda they once openly espoused. It's no secret that Democrats think mass illegal immigration will accrue to their electoral advantage over the long term. For years, they have felt comfortable saying so routinely on national television.\n\nIndeed, the notion that \"demographics is destiny\" has been a long-running belief among Democrats, famously spelled out in John Judis and Ruy Teixeira's widely acclaimed 2002 book, \"The Emerging Democratic Majority.\" Part of their argument rests on the assumption that immigration, legal and illegal, will swell the ranks of Democrat voters and hasten the inevitable emergence of a permanent Democratic majority.\n\nThat theory, whatever its merits in 2002, is looking weaker by the year. Under President Trump, the Republican Party made huge inroads among black and Hispanic voters, especially in areas like south Texas and Florida, where Democrats' theory of demographics would have suggested such GOP gains would be impossible.\n\nIt's not just Republican voters who are getting more diverse, but also Republican officeholders. As Henry Olsen noted after the 2020 election , which saw a record number of Republican women and minorities elected to the House, \"every seat Republicans have flipped from blue to red has been captured by a woman or a minority.\"\n\nThe Virginia statewide elections last year continued this trend, with a black woman, Winsome Sears, elected lieutenant governor, and an Hispanic man, Jason Miyares, elected attorney general. So much for the emerging Democratic majority.\n\nBut here's the thing: Republicans didn't come up with the \"demographics is destiny\" idea. Democrats did. For years, they bragged that rising levels of immigration and massive demographic change would usher in profound changes in U.S. politics. The Buffalo shooter went on and on about this in his idiotic manifesto, echoing similar diatribes from other racist mass shooters in recent years. Wonder where they got the idea?\n\nSUPERCUT! Dangerous Demagogues Spread 'Great Replacement Theory' pic.twitter.com/g5x4KgylrM\n\nIt's true that the country is becoming more racially and ethnically diverse. That's not a good thing or a bad thing, it's simply a fact.\n\nThe problem for Democrats is that this more diverse electorate isn't voting the way they hoped it would. In part, that's because Republicans are waking up to the fact that immigration and border security, together with other commonsense policies like not letting rioters burn down neighborhoods and not shutting down the economy because of Covid, are issues that can broaden their base and bring in a more diverse array of voters.\n\nAll of which is to say, asinine white supremacist notions about how all the races should live separately have absolutely nothing to do with efforts to control illegal immigration, and most people know it. When Democrats try to smear Republicans as white supremacists for wanting a secure border, understand that they're not just trying to demonize the right, they're trying to change the subject. Illegal immigration is just about the last thing any Democrat wants voters thinking about heading into the midterms.\n\nWhy? Because the border is a complete disaster. According to the latest data , federal authorities arrested more than 234,000 illegal immigrants in April, yet another record-breaking monthly total. So far this fiscal year, nearly 1.3 million illegal border-crossers have been arrested along the southwest border, also a record.\n\nOrdinary, non-white supremacist Americans of all races and walks of life look at this and think something must be very wrong at the border. They see news stories like the one this week about an industrial-scale drug-smuggling tunnel that federal authorities discovered on the California-Mexico border - six stories deep and the length of six football fields, with reinforced walls, electricity, ventilation and a rail system - and they wonder what's going on in Mexico.\n\nThey are smart enough to know that drugs like fentanyl, which is ravaging American communities, come primarily from labs in northern Mexico that are controlled by powerful cartels. They also know that these cartels are in the business of drug and human trafficking, and that they profit off mass illegal immigration.\n\nVoters are not stupid, certainly not stupid enough to believe that the GOP and Tucker Carlson are fomenting white supremacist conspiracy theories. But the editors at The New York Times and the Washington Post, along with every leading Democrat including the president, think they are. At this point, they're counting on it.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media. All rights reserved."

      "text": "Where Did 6 Million Presidential Votes For Democrats Go Between 2020 and 2024?\n\nIt's unclear where the Democratic vote went in 2024.\n\nLast month, Karl Rove published a Wall Street Journal op-ed noting that, with 2.2 million California votes then yet to be counted, in 2024 Kamala Harris obtained some 7.5 million fewer votes than Joe Biden had in 2020. With the votes now in, we see Donald Trump received 77.3 million votes nationwide this year, 3,056,000 more than his 74.25 million in 2020.\n\nBy contrast, Harris received a whopping 6,267,500 fewer than Biden did. Where did Biden's 2020 voters and their votes go in 2024?\n\nEven if half of the 6 million went to Trump's 3 million improvement, this still leaves the question of what happened to Biden's 3 million who forsook Harris. We know they didn't go to third-party candidates, because the totals for third-party candidates declined 656,000 in 2024, from 2,272,500 in 2020 to 1,616,600 (all numbers are rounded).\n\nNext, let's see where Trump improved his vote tally in 2024 over 2020. He obtained his extra 6 million from all but ten states: Alaska (down 5,500), Hawaii (-3,000), Indiana (-9,600), Kansas (-12,400), Louisiana (-47,000), Mississippi (-8,800), Oregon (-39,000), Washington (-53,600), West Virginia (-11,900), Wyoming (-1,000). In each of these ten states, Harris' 2024 votes declined from 2020 approximately double or more than Trump's decline, so his drop did not help her.\n\nHarris' totals in 44 states were below Biden's, according to my calculations using vote totals rounded from Federal Election Commission results for 2016 and 2020 and the currently available results from the 50 states and D.C. for 2024. Harris improved the 2024 vote tally over Biden's 2020 tally in only six states. Utah's vote for Harris increased over Biden by a mere 2,300.\n\nThe other five were swing states, discussed below. Amazingly, although Harris improved on Biden in these six states, Harris was still eclipsed by Trump's improvements and he won all six states. Let's see what happened in the seven swing states (in alphabetical order):\n\nNext, let's sample ten other states (also in alphabetical order):\n\nAgain, it's unclear where the Democratic vote went in 2024, since only half of the missing votes between 2020 and 2024 may have gone to Trump and none to third-party candidates. Maybe they stayed home, as Rove suggests? Or was it that the Democratic vote in 2020 was somehow inflated - perhaps it wasn't real (i.e., wasn't legal), as Rove rejects?\n\nIt certainly may seem that, for some reason, Biden's 2020 vote total of 81 million was an outlier, since it was a whopping 15 million more than Hillary Clinton's vote total in 2016. At the same time, however, Trump's 2020 total of 74 million was 11 million over his 63 million in 2016, and there is no claim that Trump's 2020 total was inflated by illegal votes.\n\nIf Biden's 2020 vote was an outlier, then maybe we should look at Clinton's 2016 vote for some kind of baseline. How did Harris do by comparison? Overall, Harris had 75 million in 2024 compared to Hillary's 66 million in 2016.\n\nIn 47 states, Harris did appreciably better than Clinton did. In Pennsylvania she did a half million better, in Texas by 1 million, and in Virginia by 400,000. She declined from Hillary in only three states, and then only by a bit: Illinois, Louisiana, and Mississippi.\n\nFor an additional reference point, let's look at how Trump did in 2024 over 2016. Trump garnered 77.3 million votes in 2024 versus 63 million in 2016, an improvement of more than 14 million. He improved substantially in every state except Maine, where he improved by only 2,500 votes.\n\nHere are results from 13 states, including all seven swing states (in alphabetical order), that account for more than 7 million of Trump's 14-plus million improvement: Arizona (Trump went up 500,000), California (up 1.5 million), Florida (1.5 million), Georgia (500,000), Michigan (500,000), Nevada (250,000), New Mexico (100,000), North Carolina (500,000), Pennsylvania (600,000), South Carolina (300,000), Utah (350,000), Virginia (300,000), Wisconsin (300,000).\n\nSo, why was Biden so high in 2020 and Harris so low in 2024?\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "Democrats' Double Standard On Judicial Impartiality Is Obvious From Wisconsin To Washington\n\nThere's a huge disconnect between D.C. and Wisconsin Democrats: a judicial double standard that exists to give the left more power.\n\nThe statues of Lady Justice that stand outside courthouses across the country show her blindfolded for a reason: They represent the fundamental commitment of our justice system to fair, impartial judges. That concept is not only an aspiration, but a constitutional guarantee: Inherent in the 14th Amendment's promise of \"due process of law\" is the principle that judges who hear cases at all levels will be fair, unbiased, and open-minded as to the litigants and issues before them.\n\nThat promise is being put to the test in my home state of Wisconsin, where newly elected Justice Janet Protasiewicz is currently considering a motion to recuse from a case involving the state's legislative districts. Wisconsin elects its judges, and during the campaign last spring then-Judge Protasiewicz went further than any previous candidate in announcing her views on the campaign trail. Although the maps were approved 17 months ago by the Wisconsin Supreme Court and the law has not changed, Judge Protasiewicz called the maps \"gerrymandered,\" \"rigged,\" \"unfair,\" and \"wrong,\" going so far as to say that \"anybody with any sense knows our maps are rigged.\" She said it multiple times, in multiple places, with intention. She knew the issue would motivate Democrat voters to turn out, and she played that card boldly, deciding to prioritize electoral success over ethical expectations.\n\nWhat is more, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin also heard her aggressive rhetoric loud and clear. The party, which can take unlimited funds into its coffers and make unlimited transfers to candidates, ultimately gave almost $10 million to her campaign in direct donations.\n\nImmediately following her election last April, left-wing activists in Wisconsin promised a petition to revisit the maps. But they did not file their lawsuit right away - they waited several months during the lame-duck tenure of the prior justice and then filed their petition demanding immediate action the day after Justice Protasiewicz was sworn in. Their contrived timeline is the definition of judge-shopping.\n\nNow that the case is pending, some in Wisconsin want to rush into a debate about impeachment and misconduct in office, but that puts the cart before the horse. The first step is simple and obvious: Protasiewicz should recuse from the case. Her campaign activities may have been protected by the First Amendment, but that does not mean her sitting on the case does not violate the due-process guarantee of the 14th Amendment.\n\nAs Justice Ann Walsh Bradley, leader of the liberal block on the court, wrote in 2015, \"A fundamental principle of our democracy is that judges must be perceived as beyond price.\" As a result, \"the right to an impartial decisionmaker stretches beyond the absence of actual bias to encompass the appearance of bias as well.\" In this instance, Protasiewicz's repeated, intentional comments communicating her views about this particular case mean \"a reasonable person could question the judge's impartiality.\"\n\nOf course, Democrats in Wisconsin, having sunk millions into her campaign, are loath to see her recuse from the case. The irony is that while Wisconsin Democrats are proclaiming to the high heavens the importance of a full bench and the priority of her free speech rights, Democrats in D.C. are trying to get Justice Samuel Alito to recuse himself because he gave a news interview to an attorney who moonlights as a journalist, and that lawyer is now on one of the cases pending at the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nTen Democrat senators who sit on the Senate Judiciary Committee signed a joint letter saying anything short of recusal by Alito would cause \"damage to public confidence in the Court.\" Alito filed a short opinion explaining the long tradition of justices sitting on cases involving news outlets to whom they had also given interviews, but the broader point remains the disconnect between D.C. Democrats, who are insisting on artificial adherence to newly elevated ethical standards, and Wisconsin Democrats, who are ready to steamroll long-standing ethics expectations on their way to additional legislative seats.\n\nTrue justice is necessarily impartial, neutral, and detached. Impartiality means the absence of bias or prejudice. It means maintaining an open mind. And it means not only the substance of impartiality but also the appearance of it, to ensure public confidence in our courts. Because that is not present here, the right thing to do is for Justice Protasiewicz to step aside in this case.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "If Democrats Are Worried About SCOTUS Ethics Rules, They Should Look Into Lefty Justices First\n\nDemocrats claim they need to strengthen SCOTUS ethics rules, but they never had a problem with leftist justices' glaring ethical violations.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Democrats will convene a business meeting Thursday to consider their Supreme Court \"ethics\" bill. But there is no \"ethics problem\" with the Supreme Court, and certainly not with Justices Thomas and Alito , who have been falsely smeared even though they complied with the relevant disclosure provisions in place at the time.\n\nBut it's worth reviewing the Democrats' reactions to Democrat-appointed justices' conduct to show why Democrats don't care about ethics and are using made-up \"ethics\" smears to undermine the court because the left doesn't like the court's popular recent rulings, like affirmative action, the protection of a Christian website designer's First Amendment speech rights, and the striking down of President Biden's wildly unconstitutional student loan forgiveness giveaway. Recall that ProPublica, the left-wing outfit funded by left-wing billionaires, did not start looking into the court's \"ethics\" until after the Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade .\n\nThe Democrats claim they need to strengthen the recusal provisions for justices, but they never had any problem with Justice Ginsburg's husband's firm appearing repeatedly before the Supreme Court. Justice Ginsburg never recused, and in fact, she voted in favor of her husband's firm's client in the 2007 KSR International case. Nor did she recuse when Marty Ginsburg's former client, Ross Perot , who had gifted him an endowed chair at Georgetown Law Center, appeared before the court in 1997. No Democrat or the media ever raised concerns about this.\n\nThe Democrats and media have claimed the court has become too partisan , with no basis for this claim. But Democrats had no problem when Justice Ginsburg accepted the Eleanor Roosevelt Award (and statue) from the National Women's Democrat Club, a partisan organization dedicated to electing Democrats. NPR Supreme Court reporter Nina Totenberg even emceed this partisan event!\n\nImagine if Justice Thomas or Alito had accepted an award from the Republican National Committee. Heads would have exploded. Totenberg would have been first out of the gate condemning this brazenly unethical act. But no Democrat or reporter ever expressed concerns about Ginsburg's openly political act or whether this would have any adverse effects on the court's integrity.\n\nOr consider that Ginsburg autographed her Virginia Military Institute opinion to be used in an auction in 1998 to raise funds for the pro-abortion group National Organization for Women (NOW) PAC. No Democrat has ever expressed concerns about Ginsburg using her position to explicitly help a pro-abortion group raise money. But imagine if Alito signed a copy of his epic Dobbs opinion and gave it to the pro-life Susan B. Anthony group to raise funds.\n\nIn January 2004, Ginsburg gave opening remarks at a lecture series, titled the \"Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg Distinguished Lecture Series on Women and the Law,\" co-sponsored by the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund. She gave these remarks two weeks after she had ruled in a case in the same manner a NOW Legal Defense Fund brief had urged. No Democrat ever expressed any concern that she spoke at this left-wing pro-abortion organization's lecture series (which Ginsburg allowed to use her name) that regularly files briefs at the court, and Ginsburg never recused from cases involving NOW LDF.\n\nIn the most unethical act by any justice in modern history, Ginsburg publicly attacked candidate Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential race to stop him from being elected. She called him a \"faker\" and criticized him for not releasing his taxes.\n\nBut when she made some of these unethical remarks to The New York Times Supreme Court reporter Adam Liptak, he mentioned nothing about how unethical her comments were. The headline was \"Ruth Bader Ginsburg, No Fan of Donald Trump, Critiques Latest Term.\" Other journalists like Linda Hirshman in Politico celebrated Ginsburg engaging in this completely unethical attack.\n\nSlate's Mark Joseph Stern admitted Ginsburg's conduct was \"not just unethical, it's dangerous,\" but not surprisingly he later in the same article excused Ginsburg's conduct as some sort of noble effort to stop Trump. I'm not aware of any Democrat members of Congress criticizing her for this outrageously unethical conduct.\n\nTo add insult to injury, when a case ( Trump v. Mazars ) came before the Supreme Court regarding whether Trump was required to release his taxes in response to a congressional subpoena, Ginsburg did not recuse and voted against Trump. No Democrat or anyone in the media seemed bothered by this, despite her having previously proclaimed her partisan and predetermined position on the matter.\n\nIn a new report this week, it was revealed that Ginsburg directed the $1 million prize she received in 2019 from the Berggruen Institute to be distributed to more than 60 groups, but she required that the recipients not be disclosed. Thus, there is no way to tell whether she should have recused from one of these groups appearing before the court. But when she announced she was distributing these funds, I am not aware of any Democrat being curious as to who would be getting this funding and whether they would appear before the court. Again, just switch the names from Ginsburg to Thomas and you know what would have followed.\n\nDemocrats claim this so-called \"ethics bill\" is needed because some justices are traveling on private jets and vacationing with wealthy friends, regardless of whether these trips have been disclosed. Many stories criticized Thomas for having friendships with wealthy individuals, which brings Thomas in \"proximity to a lifestyle of unimaginable material privilege.\"\n\nBut neither Democrats nor the media had any criticism when Ginsburg traveled with billionaire Morris Kahn and toured three countries in the Middle East in 2018 right after the court ruled in his company's favor. Kahn paid for transportation, food, and lodging. No Democrat or reporter criticized this.\n\nIn fact, while Kahn's company's case was still pending before the court in 2017, the Genesis Prize Foundation, a group to which Kahn was involved and provided significant financial support at the time, announced it was awarding Ginsburg a lifetime achievement award. (And the foundation appears initially to have wanted to award her its $1 million dollar Genesis Prize). Less than two weeks later, the Supreme Court ruled in Kahn's favor.\n\nNor did any Democrat criticize Justice Breyer for being flown around the world by the famously Democrat Pritzker family, through its various foundations, one of them regarding an architecture prize. In addition to many domestic flights funded by the Pritzker organizations, Breyer was flown to many international locations, such as Vancouver in 2019 , Paris in 2019, Toronto in 2018, Ireland and Spain in 2018, Spain and France in 2016, Beijing in 2012, London in 2012, and Norway, Sweden, and Copenhagen in 2013.\n\nNor did any Democrat raise concerns when Breyer flew on billionaire David Rubenstein's private jet to Nantucket to attend a wedding.\n\nThese smears by Democrats have nothing to do with ethics. As demonstrated, Democrats are hypocrites who don't care about ethics on the Supreme Court and are using these bogus smears to undermine the court's legitimacy because they don't like its rulings. Republicans should oppose this bill, not only because it is clearly an unconstitutional assault on a separate branch of government, but because the Democrats are acting in bad faith. To be in favor of it would be to give legitimacy to this dangerous attack on the court's integrity and independence.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "Will Racial Paranoia Still Work For Democrats In 2024?\n\nJoe Biden's speech at Morehouse College featured three of the most pernicious lies about American life.\n\n\"It's natural to wonder if democracy you hear about actually works for you,\" Joe Biden told graduates of the historical black college of Morehouse. \"What is democracy if black men are being killed in the street? What is democracy if a trail of broken promises still leaves black communities behind? What is democracy if you have to be 10 times better than anyone else to get a fair shot?\"\n\nThese are three of the most pernicious and divisive lies about American life.\n\nTo begin with, the notion that the only way for a black graduate to succeed in America is to stratospherically overachieve is an obvious myth. The United States isn't a utopia for black Americans - or anyone else, for that matter. Black neighborhoods are plagued by terrible Democrat- and state-run schools, the welfare state, and other factors. There is plenty for individuals to overcome.\n\nBut most companies, schools, and institutions these days go out of their way to find nonwhite candidates to diversify their operations. According to Morehouse's own statistics , nearly 83 percent of its graduates have a job right now or are continuing their education. The 70 percent employment rate is the same as the national average . The top 20 employers of Morehouse graduates include industry giants like Deloitte, Cigna, Google, Lockheed Martin, and AT&T. The average starting salary for a Morehouse graduate is $76,543. The average starting salary of a person with a bachelor's degree in the United States is $68,516.\n\nCould it be better? Yes. But if black Americans in the United States formed a nation unto themselves, they would have a higher living standard and more wealth per capita than nearly any other country in the world - including most of Europe . The contention that black Americans are systemically held back in the job market is paranoia.\n\nWorse, Biden insinuated that the state is targeting black lives.\n\nIn 2021, a Skeptic Research Center poll found that nearly half of liberals believed approximately 1,000 unarmed black men were murdered in one year by cops. Twenty percent of conservatives agreed . Over half of  people with \"very liberal\" political views believe 1,000 or more unarmed black men are killed by cops in a year (14 percent of them believe that number is 10,000.)  Twenty-six percent of \"liberals\" believe it is 1,000.\n\nYet according to a database compiled by Mapping Police Violence, the actual number of black men, armed and unarmed, killed by the police this year (as of this writing) is 94 - almost all of them in incidents where police officers were cleared of wrongdoing.\n\nCops fatally shoot just over 1,000 civilians per year, almost all of them dangerous, very few of them unarmed. One innocent person is too many, but the number is nowhere near what most Democrats have been programmed to believe.\n\nEven in the most infamous cases of police shootings against black Americans, none are proven to have a racial component - and that includes the murder of George Floyd and the \"clean\" shooting of Michael Brown, which had its anniversary the other day .\n\nAgain, this is not to say there aren't racists in the world - hardly - but the perception created and fostered by the left of a nation where black men are hunted by cops is a politically expedient lie.\n\nPerhaps the most harmful myth spread by Biden, one central to the Democrats' messaging, is \"voter suppression.\" Millions of Democrats now believe the GOP systemically stops black Americans from participating in \"democracy\" when, aside from some isolated incidents, no such effort exists in the United States. The voter suppression myth is effective because it is always evolving and open-ended and tied to genuine historical wrongdoing. Now even the most basic voter-integrity law - showing ID, for instance - becomes Jim Crow 2.0 to the professional Democrat.\n\nA Kaiser Family Foundation survey of black voters before the 2022 midterms found that seven in 10 said they were concerned about \"voter suppression interfering with a fair and accurate election in their state.\" When asked if they ever personally experienced voter suppression, only half said that \"they have experienced waiting in long lines at their polling place in the past, and one in five have experienced potential voter suppression such as having their registration or identification questioned.\"\n\nWhich is to say that fears of voter suppression have been so normalized that black Americans who face ordinary inconveniences - typically in blue states and Democrat-run cities - such as standing on a line or having an ID check, believe they're victims of systemic white oppression.\n\nIt is easier to cast a ballot in the United States than ever. Easier here than anywhere else in the world. Most voters don't even need to leave their homes to do it. In every state, they can request a ballot in the mail. You can get it in a dozen or so languages. You can get it weeks before an election. It is easier to vote than to buy virtually anything online. Anyone can do it.\n\nSo sending young people out into the world convinced that their country hates them is a deception meant to keep nonwhite Americans deferential to a single political party. Do they believe it? There are many reasons not to vote for Republicans, but none of Biden's scaremongering stands up to scrutiny.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "Court Says Democrats Who Broke Quorum Rules Unconstitutionally Spent $1.7 Trillion\n\nThis ruling exposes the disregard the Democrat-controlled Congress and executive branch hold for our Constitution.\n\nCongress lacked the constitutionally required quorum to pass the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023, a federal court ruled Tuesday. Accordingly, the Biden administration cannot enforce the new mandates imposed on Texas by the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which was part of the omnibus spending bill. However, Tuesday's ruling left untouched the $1.7 trillion in appropriations, and with most of the money already spent, there is no real remedy for the Democrat-controlled Congress and White House's blatant disregard for the Constitution.\n\nLast month, federal Judge James Hendrix held a bench trial in State of Texas v. Dept. of Justice , a lawsuit brought by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton against the Biden administration. In that lawsuit, Paxton challenged the constitutionality of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 based on the \"quorum clause\" of the U.S. Constitution, which is found in Article I and says:\n\nEach House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members, and a Majority of each shall constitute a Quorum to do Business ; but a smaller Number may adjourn from day to day, and may be authorized to compel the Attendance of absent Members, in such Manner, and under such Penalties as each House may provide.\n\nTexas' lawsuit argued that when the House voted on the final version of the omnibus spending bill on Dec. 23, 2022, it lacked a quorum to conduct business because only 201 of the members were physically present that day, which was less than a majority of the total number of voting House members, 435.\n\nThe House, under the control of Democrats and then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi, opted, however, to apply a proxy-voting rule that allowed absent representatives to have other members of the House cast votes on their behalf. The result? The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 passed with a tally of 225 yeas, 201 nays, and 1 present. President Joe Biden then signed the bill on Dec. 29, 2022, purporting to make it law.\n\nOn Tuesday, Judge Hendrix concluded \"that, by including members who were indisputably absent in the quorum count, the Act at issue passed in violation of the Constitution's Quorum Clause.\" However, the federal court also held that Texas only had standing, or the right to sue, to challenge one portion of the act, namely the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA).\n\nWhile the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 was a massive spending bill, Congress included several pieces of permanent legislation within the law, including the PWFA. The PWFA requires employers, including Texas, to provide reasonable accommodations to pregnant employees.\n\nThe court held that the compliance costs and burdens on Texas created an injury sufficient to allow Texas to sue for a remedy. Then, after holding that Congress lacked a quorum in passing the entire act, the court held that the Biden administration could not enforce the PWFA against the state of Texas and entered an injunction preventing the federal government from accepting or processing discrimination claims brought against Texas under the PWFA.\n\nJudge Hendrix made clear that the injunction only reached the federal government and that his decision did not prevent an \"employee from filing her own PWFA lawsuit against Texas.\" Such claims should not succeed, however, for the same reason Texas prevailed: Under the quorum clause, the House lacked the requisite number of physically present representatives to pass the legislation.\n\nTexas had also challenged a second portion of the spending bill that appropriated some $20 million to fund nonprofits and local governments to help connect illegal aliens released by Immigration and Customs Enforcement with various social services. While Texas claimed this appropriation further encouraged illegal immigration, thereby burdening Texas' education, health care, and other costs, the court found the alleged injury too speculative. Accordingly, the court held Texas lacked standing to challenge that portion of the law.\n\nConsequently, only one sliver of the massive appropriations bill saw its demise - and only for Texas. Tuesday's holding is nonetheless significant because it exposes the disregard the Democrat-controlled Congress and executive branch hold for our Constitution.\n\nThe practical significance may also grow over time, though, as other states and employers bring similar quorum clause challenges to the constitutionality of the PWFA or other permanent portions of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023. The Biden administration is unlikely to back down, however, and will surely appeal to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and, after that, seek review by the United States Supreme Court.\n\nBut as I explained previously, from an originalist perspective, Texas' theory is solid, making reversal unlikely. Watch then for the Biden administration to spin its unconstitutional conduct as a Republican attack on pregnant women - or \"pregnant persons,\" as Democrats are wont to say.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "There's Only One Reason Democrats Oppose Requiring Proof Of Citizenship To Vote\n\nDemocrats will be forced to explain why they oppose the SAVE Act, which requires documentary proof of citizenship to vote in federal elections.\n\nAs the Republican-controlled House is expected to take up a bill Wednesday aimed at making sure only U.S. citizens vote in federal elections, President Joe Biden is signaling he would kill the measure should it miraculously survive the Democrat-led Senate. Biden isn't likely to need the veto pen.\n\nDemocrats will, however, be forced to explain why they oppose the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act , which requires documentary proof of citizenship to vote for president and members of Congress.\n\nAnd while they have gotten plenty of cover from corporate media in asserting that foreign nationals - including illegal aliens - are rarely ever caught voting in federal elections, such explanations may not sit well with U.S. voters who overwhelmingly support prohibitions on noncitizens voting in federal elections. Most Americans, too, according to polls , are deeply concerned about the tsunami of illegal immigrants that has swamped U.S. communities on Biden's watch. Exactly why the Biden administration has kept the border door wide open isn't lost on anyone who has been paying attention for the past three and a half years.\n\n\"Democrats say it's already illegal for noncitizens to vote in federal elections. That's true. It's also illegal for someone to illegally enter our country, but that hasn't stopped millions and millions of people,\" U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil, R-Wis., told me Tuesday during an interview on the \" The Vicki McKenna Show \" in Milwaukee and Madison.\n\nSteil, the chairman of the House Committee on Administration, which passed H.R. 8281 in May, wants to remind anyone who will listen that Democrats already support foreign nationals voting in local elections, as they are allowed to do in Washington, D.C. Most House Democrats earlier this year voted against a measure that would have barred illegal immigrants and other noncitizens from voting in local elections in the nation's capital. The bill is deemed dead on arrival in the Senate.\n\nNot surprisingly, just 28 of the 500-plus foreign nationals voting in last month's D.C. primary elections registered as Republicans, according to The Washington Post.\n\nIn a first, noncitizens are voting in D.C. Here's what it means to them. https://t.co/1IcyuKSRdy\n\nSteil said Democrats want to use noncitizen voting in local elections, currently allowed in a handful of states, as a \"Petri dish\" to test on the American people.\n\n\"In a period of time that we know that millions of legal and illegal immigrants in the country are not eligible to vote in federal elections, it's important to enforce the laws on the books,\" the congressman said.\n\nAs it stands under the 1993 National Voter Registration Act, commonly known as the \"motor voter law,\" voters may simply check a box on the federal form affirming they are U.S. citizens and meet other eligibility requirements. Democrats prefer the honor system. In opposing the SAVE Act, they have noted the tough penalties for foreign nationals who lie about their citizenship status in registering to vote: a fine, up to five years in prison, or both, according to federal code.\n\nBut Democrats know it is difficult to track false claims of citizenship, a longtime problem. A 2014 story by WHYY, a Philadelphia public radio station, reported on a fact that remains a significant issue in the Biden presidency a decade later: \"Illegal immigrants lie to get asylum status in U.S.\"\n\nBut they certainly wouldn't lie to vote in federal elections, Democrats insist.\n\n\"We all know, intuitively, that a lot of illegals are voting in federal elections. But it's not been something that is easily provable,\" Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said at the May 8 press conference in introducing the SAVE Act.\n\nSen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, has introduced a similar measure in the Senate. He cut to the chase in a post Tuesday on his X account.\n\n\"The SAVE Act would prevent non-Americans from illegally voting, protecting the votes of American citizens. The only reason to oppose it is because you want non-Americans illegally voting,\" Lee wrote.\n\nBiden, meanwhile, is pushing Democrat legislation loosening voter integrity laws.\n\n\"The President has been clear: he will continue fighting to protect Americans' sacred right to vote in free, fair, and secure elections,\" the White House said in its opposition statement to the SAVE Act.\n\nThe SAVE Act would prevent non-Americans from illegally voting, protecting the votes of American citizens. The only reason to oppose it is because you want non-Americans illegally voting. https://t.co/Ld4QqGPMu8\n\nBut how \"free, fair, and secure\" are U.S. elections without documented proof of citizenship?\n\nBiden and his fellow Democrats in D.C. appear to be backing a losing issue. A national poll conducted last year for Americans for Citizen Voting by RMG Research Inc. found that 75 percent of respondents opposed allowing foreign nationals to vote in their local elections. A recent poll found 68 percent of North Carolina voters supported a state constitutional amendment barring foreign nationals from voting in elections. North Carolina voters will vote on the citizens-only question on November's general election ballot.\n\n\"This is a moment in time that we should all realize that we should maintain U.S. elections for U.S. citizens, and requiring documentary proof of that citizenship is how you actually enforce the law,\" Steil said.\n\nListen to the interview with Rep. Bryan Steil below.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media. All rights reserved."

The district, which leans conservative, voted for Trump by 57 percent in 2024, and Aument was re-elected unopposed in 2022.\n\nThe Democratic victory marks another upset for the party in recent months. In January, Democrats flipped a heavily Republican state Senate district in Iowa and retained the Westchester County executive seat in New York, The Hill reported.\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin called Malone's win a \"shockwave,\" emphasizing that the district had a 23-point Republican voter registration advantage.\n\n\"In a district that went to Trump by 15 in 2024 and has a 23-point Republican voter registration advantage, Malone's victory is a loud and clear rebuke to Republicans' threats to the programs Pennsylvania families rely on - from Social Security and Medicaid to our public schools,\" Martin said.\n\nHe added, \"To protect working Americans, Democrats like Senator-elect Malone are competing everywhere, and in special elections throughout the country, we continue to overperform as voters join us in fighting back against the Trump-Musk agenda.\"\n\nHeather Williams, president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said Democrats are \"on a roll\" in state legislative races and warned that their recent success \"should put Republicans on edge.\"\n\nPowered by The Post Millennial CMSTM Comments\n\nWe're independent and can't be cancelled.

      "text": "David Hogg under fire from fellow Democrats for using DNC contact lists to fundraise for personal PAC\n\n\"It's a stunning lack of judgment that is concerning to many people.\"\n\n\"It's a stunning lack of judgment that is concerning to many people.\"\n\nDavid Hogg , recently appointed as vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee ( DNC ), is facing criticism from within his own party for allegedly using DNC resources to solicit donations for his personal political action committee ( PAC ). The practice, while not against the rules, is being frowned upon by his critics within the party.\n\nAccording to a report by the New York Post , Hogg has sent fundraising messages to DNC contact lists, directing recipients to donate to his PAC, from which he reportedly earns over $100,000 per year. One of the eight messages sent to the DNC database read: \"David Hogg here: I was just elected DNC Vice Chair! This is a huge win for our movement to make the Democratic Party more reflective of our base: youthful, energetic, and ready to win.\"\n\nThe texts included a link to Hogg's \"Leaders We Deserve\" PAC.\n\nThe move has sparked backlash among some party officials. One top Democrat reportedly told the New York Post, \"David Hogg - talk about living up to your name. A trough of DNC dollars all for him and he doesn't seem to give an oink.\"\n\nHogg co-founded Leaders We Deserve in August 2023 with the stated goal of electing young progressive candidates. Since then, he has personally earned more than $175,000 from the PAC. While his fundraising tactics don't violate official DNC rules, some officials claim it's an ethical issue.\n\n\"It's especially important for all Democratic national officials to focus on raising support for the party and not using their position to raise money for themselves or their personal political PACS,\" another senior Democratic Party official said. \"It's a stunning lack of judgment that is concerning to many people.\"\n\nThe 24-year-old was appointed as the party's vice chair less than two weeks ago. Hogg gained national attention for his activism against gun rights following the 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Hogg was a student at the school. He has also been a vocal advocate for radical left-wing initiatives such as defunding the police and abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency.\n\n\"I mean it's just very frustrating to be in a party in desperate need of increased accountability for our struggling leadership, and watch someone who is never held accountable ascend to leadership,\" said Cameron Kasky, who was also a Stoneman Douglas survivor.\n\nHogg responded to the report by saying he \"was not doing any interviews,\" per the New York Post. A spokesperson later commented, \"David has already raised money for the DNC since becoming Vice Chair, and many times before.\"\n\n2025-02-17T21:16-0500 | Comment by: Tom\n\nHOGGS PAC money can be used for anything or put in his own pocket. HIS PAC NEEDS TO BE AUDITED!\r\nHe could  be funding all these anti-Jew, anti-Trump, and anti-DOGE protests.\n\nPowered by The Post Millennial CMSTM Comments\n\nWe're independent and can't be cancelled.

Daniel said he \"wanted to see Donald Trump in real life and now it's actually came true.\"\n\nIn an interview outside the White House with War Room co-host and White House correspondent Natalie Winters, Daniel said he gave Trump a note reading, \"Donald Trump is the best President of the United States of America.\"\n\nWinters asked Daniel what advice he would give, to which he responded, \"Please stop being mean to President Trump 'cause if I see you being mean to him, I'm coming after you... If you're a Democrat being mean to President Trump, I'm on your bumper.\"\n\nDaniel was hosted by Trump at the White House on Wednesday, where he met the president alongside his family while wearing his law enforcement uniform.

I'm about to change my voter registration to independent.\"\n\nShe later said that the \"Democratic tea party was born the same day that Chuck Schumer took to that podium to read that very well crafted statement that told us he folded like a paper napkin.\" Nine Democrats and one independent, Angus King, who caucuses with the Democrats, voted to advance the continuing resolution . Democratic Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto, Dick Durbin, Brian Schatz, Chuck Schumer, John Fetterman, Maggie Hassan, Gary Peters, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Jeanne Shaheen voted in favor of the CR, which passed 62 to 38 in the cloture vote. In the final vote, the bill passed through the Senate with a vote of 54 to 46. Two Democrats joined the Republican senators in passing the bill. Voting for the CR in the final vote were King and Shaheen. The lone Republican to vote against it was Senator Rand Paul, per ABC News . Ahead of the vote to advance the CR, Schumer said on the Senate floor, \"While the bill is very bad, the potential for a shutdown has consequences for America that are much, much worse.\" He added that the \"Republican bill is a terrible option. It is not a clean CR, it is deeply partisan, it doesn't address far too many of this country's needs, but I believe allowing Donald Trump to take even more power via a government shutdown is a far worse option.\"\n\nShe later said that the \"Democratic tea party was born the same day that Chuck Schumer took to that podium to read that very well crafted statement that told us he folded like a paper napkin.\"\n\nNine Democrats and one independent, Angus King, who caucuses with the Democrats, voted to advance the continuing resolution .
