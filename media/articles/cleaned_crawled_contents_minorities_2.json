      "text": "Why Trump sees 'racism by minorities against whites' as a huge issue\n\nAuthoritarian governments are drawn from and always represent, first and foremost, the interests of the majority group within their country. Christians in 1933 Germany. Orthodox Slavs in Russia. Hindus in India. Whites in America.\n\nAuthoritarian leaders bind themselves to these groups by defining members of minority groups as \"the enemy\" of the larger majority, demonizing them and subjecting them to economic and physical brutality under the nation's laws.\n\nThis is exactly the dynamic playing out right now in the nearly-all-white GOP. They have an extensive plan to exploit charges of \"racism against white people\" to seize control of the American government.\n\nAccording to Donald Trump and the MAGA GOP, racism has become a huge problem in America. Specifically, racism by minorities against white people. Seriously.\n\nREAD: How Trump is following Hitler's playbook\n\nReality doesn't quite line up with Trump's concern that Black people and other minorities are eating the lunch of their white neighbors:\n\n- For people of the same age and with the same level of education, Black men earn only 72 percent as much as White men. - The median Black family in America has $27,000 in wealth ; the median White family sits on $250,400. - Roughly two-thirds of white families (66%) own stock and benefit from that investment vehicle; fewer than a third (29%) of Black families are able to invest in the stock market. - About a quarter (24%) of Black families have no wealth but are in debt, compared with 11% of White families. - About three-quarters (72.7%) of White families own their own homes , compared with 44 percent of Black families. - It's even harder for Black people to vote: Black voters are twice as likely to have to wait more than a half-hour in line than white people.\n\nAs the American Bar Association noted about Georgia's voter suppression \"exact match\" eligibility requirement:\n\nBut sure, white people are the victims of widespread discrimination in America and the efforts of the federal government must be directed toward protecting them from \"racist\" policies that harm them.\n\nJust ask the Republicans on the federal bench and the Supreme Court.\n\nWhen he wrote the 2013 decision gutting the Voting Rights Act (VRA) of 1965, Chief Justice John Roberts - who had outspokenly opposed protecting the rights of Black people to vote when he worked in the Reagan administration - claimed that anti-Black racism in America was over and the VRA was no longer necessary to protect the rights of racial minorities:\n\nWhen Congress passed $4 billion in Covid debt aid to minority farmers, a federal judge in Florida blocked implementation of the program and distribution of its money, claiming that its exclusion of white farmers was racist.\n\nWhen, in the wake of Covid, Congress passed and the Biden administration rolled out a $29 billion program to aid restaurants that, during its first four weeks, prioritized women- and minority-owned restaurants, a Trump-aligned group successfully sued before a Bush-appointed judge by claiming the program was an example of discrimination against white men.\n\nLast year, Republicans on the Supreme Court, responding to another rightwing lawsuit, ended affirmative action in college admissions programs. In addition to cutting the number of Black college students nationwide from roughly 7 percent of enrollments to around 4 percent within a year, the long-term result will be that senior positions in corporate America and on corporate boards will become more and more white as today's students graduate into the business world.\n\nAll across the nation, diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and other efforts to undo over four hundred years of institutionalized racism are falling under pressure from white Republican politicians, judges, and activists. Project 2025 promises to gut as many such DEI efforts as possible.\n\nDonald Trump has even promised that every single diversity or anti-racism program within the federal government - in every agency from HHS to the Department of Defense - will end if he succeeds in seizing our government this fall. Trump's campaign aide Steven Cheung told Axios :\n\nTrump himself doubled down last year, saying :\n\nWhich shouldn't surprise us at all, given that, as Phillip Bump pointed out in yesterday's Washington Post , the first time Trump was profiled in The New York Times was when he and his father were busted for refusing to rent to Black people.\n\nNow he wants the entire nation to, essentially, refuse to rent to Black people. Or educate them. Or provide them with healthcare. Or let them vote. Or work. And all without recourse to the courts or to government aid.\n\nOnce the racist MAGA plan is accomplished, America will again rain hell on racial, gender, and religious minorities, just as Hitler did with Jews, Putin is doing with gays, and Modi is doing with Muslims.\n\nWhile democratic governments are driven by the public good (defining \"public\" in the most inclusive sense possible), authoritarian governments - like the old American Confederacy that Trump wants to emulate - are driven by fear and hate.\n\nAnd that is exactly the America that Trump, his legal beagles, and their white MAGA followers are promising."

      "text": "Threatening texts targeting minorities after election were vile - but they might not be illegal\n\nThe FBI and police in several states are investigating a wave of hateful texts and emails apparently targeting minorities across the United States following the presidential election.\n\nThe anonymously sent messages, which may have numbered up to 500,000, varied in their specific language but had similarly menacing themes . Some referred to recipients as \"selected for slavery\" and ordered them to a plantation to pick cotton. Others said they'd be picked up for deportation or sent to a reeducation camp.\n\nThe threats lacked details on timing, location and the like. Some addressed recipients by name, while others contained no greeting or personal identifier. They seemed to be targeting Black people, immigrants and LGBTQ people but may have been dispatched indiscriminately to a wide swath of Americans.\n\nInformation technology experts have expressed confidence that the perpetrators will be identified . Yet it's not clear to me as a professor of constitutional and criminal law that they can be prosecuted. The First Amendment generally protects free speech, even when it's heinous.\n\nSeveral Supreme Court decisions have established that speech may not be punished just because it is offensive or hateful .\n\n\"If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable,\" the justices wrote in Texas v. Johnson, a 1989 case that affirmed flag burning is protected expression.\n\nSnyder v. Phelps , a 2010 case involving anti-LGBTQ protesters who carried hateful signs at the funerals of fallen soldiers, strengthened that precedent.\n\n\"Speech is powerful. It can stir people to action, move them to tears of both joy and sorrow, and - as it did here - inflict great pain,\" the justices wrote. Nonetheless, they concluded, \"We cannot react to that pain by punishing the speaker. As a Nation we have chosen a different course - to protect even hurtful speech.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court has been cautious in recognizing exceptions to the freedom of speech because of its importance to democracy and individual autonomy. Under special circumstances, however, some types of speech can be illegal.\n\nOne recognized exception is a \" true threat .\"\n\nIn the 2023 case Counterman v. Colorado , the Supreme Court held that for speech to cross over the true threat line, the speaker must both express an intent to commit violence and recklessly disregard \"a substantial risk that his communications would be viewed as threatening violence.\"\n\nAn example of a true threat under the Counterman case would be for a scorned lover to barrage their ex with messages promising to kill or maim them.\n\nThis standard is so new that it has not been tested thoroughly in the lower courts, making predictions risky at best. In my analysis, however, a message mass distributed to thousands of recipients indicating that they had been \"selected\" to be a slave might not meet the Counterman standard.\n\nAdditionally, \"slave\" is a legal status that hasn't existed for over 150 years, so the threat to force someone into enslaved labor likely lacks both the peril of physical harm and the plausibility of harmful action. The anonymity of the senders may add to this implausibility.\n\nCourts may also find that the communications didn't create a \"significant\" risk that a \"reasonable\" recipient would feel threatened. An anonymous mass message may be interpreted as spam, or trolling.\n\nAccordingly, the messages probably would not rise to the level of \"true threat\" exceptions to First Amendment protections.\n\nOther exceptions recognized by the Supreme Court are speech that incites others to imminent lawlessness and \"fighting words.\"\n\nYet the November messages didn't call others to violence, nor were their words likely to provoke it - the two hallmarks of incitement . \"Fighting words,\" meanwhile, require face-to-face communication that is likely to incite a violent reaction . This did not happen in the November messages, either.\n\nThere's another problem with any legal case against the culprits behind the November messages: What crime would they even be charged with?\n\nThe law enforcement officials who've pledged to get to the bottom of the matter have expressed outrage and concern , but they have not identified what law they believe was broken.\n\nOhio Attorney General Dave Yost is an exception.\n\n\"Other people have no First Amendment right to your phone, and free speech doesn't protect telephone harassment,\" Yost said in a post on X on Nov. 7 when he opened an inquiry into the hateful texts received by an an unspecified number of Ohioans .\n\nYost was likely referring to a 2011 Ohio statute that criminalizes telecommunications that are \"threatening, intimidating, menacing, coercive, or obscene with the intent to abuse, threaten, or harass the recipient.\"\n\nThe intersection of telephone harassment and the First Amendment is less clear, in my analysis. Laws vary by state, but illegal harassment and stalking typically involves physical conduct, which is not protected by the First Amendment - for example, repeated unwanted visits to someone's home or workplace. Continually following someone in a manner intended to cause fear - or which recklessly causes fear or emotional distress - would be another example.\n\nCould a text or email be characterized as conduct rather than speech? That is unsettled law. And where the law is unclear, novel legal strategies can set a new precedent.\n\nIf a court were to decide that the act of sending the November messages was \"pure conduct,\" rather than protected speech, then anti-harassment laws might be used to prosecute the senders.\n\nCriminal law aside, people are not powerless against vile communications.\n\nTelecommunications companies are free to block messages, both before they are received and in response to customer requests. After the wave of hateful texts in November, many did just that by closing accounts identified as sources of those messages.\n\nIf a blocked sender continues to send similar communications to a target, the elements of harassment would be met. A court could determine that to be expressive conduct or simply speech not protected by the First Amendment.\n\nThe U.S. draws the boundary widely around free speech because it enables wide, controversial discussions of politics, law and society. In this case, the senders ran up to the line of protected speech but quite possibility didn't cross it.\n\n\"The trouble with fighting for human freedom is that one spends most of one's time defending scoundrels,\" the author H.L. Mencken once said. \"For it is against scoundrels that oppressive laws are first aimed, and oppression must be stopped at the beginning if it is to be stopped at all.\"\n\nDaniel Hall , Professor of Political Science & Justice and Community Studies, Miami University\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

      "text": "Trump's Justice Department finds yet another way to oppress minorities\n\nAs Donald Trump calls for suppression of Black Lives Matter protests against police abuse, new data reveal another form of Trumpian suppression of minorities. His administration is failing to enforce laws against racial discrimination in lending.\n\nDetailed analysis of mortgage loan applications that were approved or denied found pervasive redlining in 61 metro areas .\n\nYet Trump's Justice Department is nowhere to be found. It referred only four fair-lending cases in 2018, one of which had nothing to do with race or national origin. Those four cases represent an 84% drop from the Obama administration's annual average of 25.5 cases. Further, government files show that the Trump administration is closing out Obama era cases more than pursuing new ones.\n\nIn Trump World, however, any enforcement action involving anti-discrimination law gets promoted as substantial no matter how minuscule the money or how narrow the case.\n\nThree basic federal laws prohibit discrimination in pricing and making decisions on mortgages and other lending, such as auto loans, unsecured consumer loans, student loans and credit cards.\n\nPlenty of evidence exists that many financial firms violate federal law by routinely mistreating minorities. The lack of enforcement by Trump & Co. prompts a question from Bill Dedman, the Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter who in the 1980s proved pervasive redlining-discriminating against mortgage seekers in minority neighborhoods. LDedman has shown that it remains a persistent major problem.\n\nBMy another measure fair lending cases have fallen to an average of 2.5 per year under Trump, from 13.1 under Obama and 3.3 under George W. Bush, Dedman said.\n\nHe asked, \"Has discrimination declined suddenly? Has the Justice Department under Trump changed policies? Or have the banking regulators?\"\n\nThe answer is clear-Trump & Co. don't give a damn about black, brown and other people discriminated against in financial matters.\n\nThe proof is in how they respond to evidence of discrimination. The response is not proportional but weak.\n\nDespite all its open animosity to people of color, the Trump administration can't just stop enforcing anti-discrimination laws. So, instead of focusing federal law enforcement on broad schemes affecting vast numbers of people, it looks for gnats. Then the Trump administration settles cases on cheap, abuser-friendly terms.\n\nHere's what Trump's Justice Department appointees declared in their latest annual report on enforcement of the 1976 Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA):\n\nIn 2018, the Civil Rights Division attained substantial relief for victims of lending discrimination in two settlements addressing discrimination in mortgage lending under ECOA and the [Federal Housing Administration], and relief for service members in three settlements involving unlawful repossessions, foreclosures, and vehicle lease terminations.\n\nRead down to the details, scant as they are, in Assistant Attorney General Eric S. Dreiband's report and you'll find only a handful of cases. All were dispensed with as the regulatory equivalent of parking tickets.\n\nCivil rights groups opposed Dreiband's 2018 nomination as assistant attorney general for civil rights. He was confirmed with the bare minimum of 50 Senate votes .\n\nConsider Robert N. Hatfield of Wilkesboro, N.C., who buys, sells and finances real estate and rents housing. Since at least 2004, he groped women, offered discounts for sex and retaliated against those who refused , the Justice Department stated in court papers. Hatfield could have been referred for criminal prosecution, but the Trump administration let him off with $550,000 that he is supposed to pay his victims and a $50,000 fine.\n\nDreiband also cited his office's $1 million settlement with Pacific Mercantile Bancorp, an Orange County, Calif., lender accused of overpricing loans to minorities. The bank's report to shareholders reveals that the case began in 2016, which means under the Obama administration. That raises the question of whether the Trump administration let the bank off cheap, as it has done in many separate cases at various regulatory agencies.\n\nThen there's Home Loan Auditors LLC, accused by the Obama administration of running a \"predatory mortgage rescue scheme\" that abused California Hispanics. It charged $5,000 and up for supposed \"low value\" audits and gave bad advice, the Justice Department said.\n\nThe Trump administration's achievement ballyhooed in its latest report? It tacked on a seventh case, affecting two people and less than $100,000.\n\nBut it's not just in housing where the Justice Department was so unaggressive. It also looked out for discrimination in car loans. Its primary example? Failure to refund prepaid fees to people who leased BMWs.\n\nBut Team Trump didn't turn a blind eye to people whose circumstances would not put them behind the wheel of a German luxury car, even a leased one. Dreiband also brought a case against California Auto Finance, a subprime auto lender.\n\nThis case is revealing because it did not assert overall foul practices or any broad pattern of discrimination. Typically, the federal government looks for cases that will make a statement that discourages others from misconduct, a policy known as general deterrence. The idea is that similarly situated people read about what happened to someone in their circumstances and decide to behave lawfully.\n\nBut this case was specific-very specific. It involved Andrea Starks. In 2015, she bought a nine-year-old Chevrolet HHR, a small sport utility vehicle, for $7,583, plus another $989 in fees, from an auto dealership that was unnamed in the Justice Department's lawsuit. California Auto Finance loaned Starks $7,572 at an eye-popping 24% interest rate.\n\nEight months later, California Auto Finance repossessed the car without a court order, three weeks after Stark joined the U.S. Army. That repossession violated federal law against repossessing the cars of enlisted military personnel, although Starks was a private citizen when she bought the car and when she fell behind on her payments.\n\nStarks, an Army specialist (responsibilities of a private, pay of a corporal) stands to get $30,000 in recompense while the lender is to pay a $50,000 fine to Treasury.\n\nThe facts in this specific case can reasonably be viewed as a scheme to get the car and evade payment by enlisting. But a larger issue is the use of the Justice Department in such a small and unique case rather than as the prime example in a broad case against abusive lenders.\n\nSo why not go after the many financial firms that routinely abuse soldiers and sailors by the thousands, as my dogged colleague at The New York Times, Diana B. Henriques , documented in articles over seven years here , here , here , here and here ?\n\nOf course, filing cases when military personnel are abused is not the only way to fight discrimination. There's public education, too.\n\nDreiband boasted that \"during 2018, the Department gave presentations on the\" Service Members Civil Relief Act from lender abuse \"at 14 events nationwide.\" Two million Americans under arms and 14 events. So impressive. When it comes to fighting racial discrimination, the Trump administration is so very, very impressive."

      "text": "The Racists in Trump's Base Want Him to Harm Minorities and Immigrants: This Is What We Have to Fight\n\nStudy after study has shown that support for Donald Trump correlates more strongly with racial resentment than with economic anxiety. Despite the wrongheaded efforts of the (mostly white) journalists, pundits and talking heads who have tried to explain away racism as a reason for Trump's victory, the statistics continually show us that Trump supporters are more racist and sexist than the general population.\n\nNote that for all of the explanations of economic anxiety and economic populism as the reason Trump won, Trump voters aren't exactly in an uproar over Trump's plan to install the richest cabinet in U.S. history. We can actually hear the crickets. There's been no outrage from Trump voters over Trump (already!) breaking his economic promises to \"drain the swamp.\" Newt Gingrich even let the mask slip when he admitted that \"Trump doesn't want to drain the swamp anymore.\" Gingrich quickly apologized, but the truth was out: Trump has no intention of following through on his campaign attacks on special interests or elites. It didn't matter if Gingrich apologized or notâ€Š-â€ŠTrump voters simply don't care if he follows through on his economic promises.\n\nSo what can the left actually do if they want to take back political control of Washington? How do we weaken Trump's presidency, splinter his base and make him a one-term president? The answer is simpleâ€Š-we stop him from harming minorities.\n\nTrump Voters Will Turn on Him\n\nThere is this idea out there on the left that facts don't matter anymore and nothing can stop Trump's white nationalism (or what some journalists are still mislabeling \"populism\"). I think this is a misguided view. Trump voters have openly and honestly admitted what they want: the subjugation of minorities by the state and the upholding of the social caste system that keeps white people and their racial interests at the top.\n\nAnn Coulter is someone I personally detest, but she wrote an article on Breitbart that acknowledges the precariousness of Trump's political position. She noted that, \"if Trump doesn't appoint the sort of people capable of fulfilling his campaign promises on immigration, he will fail. He'll be just another lying politician , and his supporters will watch in horror as rapists, terrorists and drug dealers continue living in our country.\"\n\nWhat Coulter is saying is that Trump's base will turn on him if he cannot deliver on his immigration promises. If Trump doesn't deport a record number of Latinos or \"build the wall,\" he'll be seen as \"just another lying politician.\" If Trump does not deliver on his promises of harming minorities, his base will flip on him like IHOP, and he'll go from an anti-establishment outsider to a Washington insider protecting elites and special interests.\n\nNaturally, we can extrapolate from what Coulter is saying to infer other instances where Trump voters will turn on him if he cannot deliver. If Trump fails to ban Muslims from the country or start a Muslim registry, his base will turn on him. If Trump cannot crush black protesters and enhance police powers like stop-and-frisk, his base will turn on him. If Trump is unable to curtail the cultural change white voters feel threatened by, Trump will turn into a Washington elite overnight. If Trump can't harm minorities, his base will view him as a sellout.\n\nProtecting Minorities Will Take a United Democratic Front in Congress\n\nIf Trump fails to harm minorities, his political position will weaken immensely. He is already one of the most unpopular presidents-elect in modern history, and any sort of significant drop in support could see him become one of the most unpopular presidents in American history. An unpopular President Trump will be associated with the Republican Party at large, which could push Democrats to win a host of governorships in 2018 and take back the White House in 2020.\n\nBut in order to squash Trump's approval ratings, Democrats will have to maintain a united front. That means no \"Bernie pushing to work with Trump on economic issues for heartland white workers.\" Bernie Sanders pushing to work with Trump on certain issues makes Trump seem like he has bipartisan support. If Trump gets bills passed with Sanders' support, that gives Trump political capital to spend however he wishes. And Trump would spend that political capital on indulging his base with xenophobic, racist policies like banning Muslims from entering the country or building a wall.\n\nDemocrats must stand together against Trump. A great example of the kind of leadership that can make Trump unpopular came from House Rep. Maxine Waters, who refuses to meet with or work with the president-elect. Waters has taken the exact opposite approach of Bernie Sanders and Tulsi Gabbard, who have indicated willingness to work with Trump and provide him with political capital. If Democrats are to weaken Trump and ultimately defeat him, they can't provide him with any wins or with a bipartisan cloak he can use to hide from his extremist, xenophobic politics. Democrats must remain united in opposition to keep him from delivering on his campaign promises to harm minorities."

      "text": "Minorities in STEM Are in Short Supply  -  Why We Need to Fix That\n\nD emand for Stem-trained (science, technology, engineering and math) workers continues to grow. Stem job vacancies take more than twice as long to fill as those in other fields and many businesses have a hard time finding qualified Stem applicants. Yet there is a great potential pool of Stem talent: America's minorities.\n\nIf you are a student from a minority background, you are much less likely to know someone in a Stem career than other students and more likely to be the first in your family to go to college. If you find yourself interested in a Stem degree and career, chances are you will need to look beyond your immediate family - and even your schools - for guidance. I know I felt this way as a young woman interested in science and math.\n\nNearly 75% of US scientists and engineers are white. And, despite comprising 26% of the workforce, African Americans and Hispanics represent only 11% of all Stem employees. Addressing this lack of diversity is key if the US wants to be a leader in Stem fields.\n\nEveryone benefits when we produce talented Stem employees and many of the United States' best opportunities for economic growth come from jobs that require Stem skills. Recognizing this need, the White House launched Educate to Innovate to \"provide students at every level with the skills they need to excel in the high-paid, highly-rewarding fields of science, technology, engineering and math.\" Faced with the effects of climate change, we will need even more Stem graduates to protect the environment and address the detrimental impact of increased greenhouse gases on the planet.\n\nIf you take a closer look at programs outside of school that are successful at generating interest in Stem subjects among students from a variety of backgrounds, one common element - structured, intentional mentoring - becomes clear.\n\nAt-risk young adults who have a mentor are more likely to enroll in and graduate from college than those who do not. Programs like Girls Who Code , the Chicago Botanic Garden's Science Career Continuum and the Sphinx Organization offer formal mentoring structures - whether mentors are paid or volunteers - through which youth are given access to people who are committed to supporting the success of the next generation.\n\nWhen a student receives one-on-one attention from a mentor, it enables them to envision a rewarding career that they might otherwise have considered out of reach. Mentors provide education and career advice, encouragement and support as students explore new fields and develop new skills.\n\nThe goals of mentoring, and programs like Educate to Innovate, are to move a diverse population of American students from the middle to the front of the pack in science and math. We all recognize that this will take a significant investment of time and talent - currently, more than $700m in public and private funds have been set aside for the initiative. We need to ensure that a large part of our investment goes toward formal mentorship programs because they are most effective at helping students from minority backgrounds enter Stem-based studies.\n\nIn order to ensure a steady flow of graduates, Stem practitioners should be encouraged to support and engage with programs to mentor the up-and-comers in diverse neighborhoods of their cities and towns. We need program providers to reach out to professionals and let them know they can make a difference in the lives of young people. We need to prepare a new, larger generation of Stem practitioners who will be equipped to address the growing challenges of our time. If we work together, we can achieve a future in Stem that not only drives our nation forward but also represents the rich diversity of our society."

But Obama has also stressed that criticizing the excesses of \"wokeness\" doesn't mean turning a blind eye to racism or pretending it no longer exists. And he has cited GOP presidential hopeful Nikki Haley as an example of a prominent Republican who downplays racism.\n\nDuring a mid-June interview for Democratic strategist David Axelrod's podcast \"The Axe Files,\" Obama argued, \"There's a long history of African-American or other minority candidates within the Republican Party who will validate America and say, 'Everything's great, and we can make it'..... Nikki Haley, I think, has a similar approach.\"\n\nAxelrod, during the interview, commented that Sen. Tim Scott - a Black South Carolina Republican who is running against Haley in the 2024 GOP presidential primary - voices \"half\" of Obama's views on race and agrees with him that race relations have improved in the U.S. But Axelrod also said that Republicans dismiss racism as \"part of the past, and we don't need to worry about it so much.\"\n\nHaley was quick to attack Obama in response to his comments, claiming that he is painting people of color as \"victims.\"\n\nThe former South Carolina governor and ex-U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, who is Indian-American, told the New York Post , \"Barack Obama set minorities back by singling them out as victims instead of empowering them. In America, hard work and personal responsibility matter. My parents didn't raise me to think that I would forever be a victim. They raised me to know that I was responsible for my success.\"\n\nThis wasn't the first time Haley accused Obama of setting race relations back. She made similar comments in May during an appearance on Fox News.\n\nHaley, however, glosses over Obama's many past comments about racism - and his view that some progressives take \"wokeness\" too far. In fact, Obama has drawn criticism from some progressives for his views on \"wokeness\" and \"cancel culture.\"\n\nDuring a 2019 interview with SiriusXM, Obama argued , \"You know, sometimes, people just want to not feel as if they are walking on eggshells. And they want some acknowledgment that life is messy and that all of us at any given moment can say things the wrong way, make mistakes.\"\n\nMaher, similarly, has argued that Americans are sick of feeling they have to \"walk on eggshells\" because of progressives who are too easily offended. But Maher also slams MAGA Republicans for being hypersensitive \"snowflakes.\""

      "text": "Minorities and the Media: Little Ownership and Even Less Control\n\nAmerican culture is more diverse now than ever. For years, media regulators and observers in this country have touted the virtue and necessity of increased minority presence in the development and ownership of media content and distribution, in order to ensure that the voices of all Americans are heard. But with the proliferation of media mergers and buyouts of minority-owned broadcast stations, the plight of minority media is more discouraging now than it was a generation ago. And almost as unsettling, the roles of minorities and women in Hollywood continue to be far less significant than those of their white male counterparts, regardless of attempts to bolster their numbers and their decision-making power in Hollywood. Minorities and the Broadcast Medium Today \"Minority ownership\" has generally been defined as any media facility in which minorities possess more than 50 percent of a firm�s equity interests or stock, and/or exercise actual control of the facility. According to a 2001 report released by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) on the state of media ownership in this country, minorities owned 449 of the 11,865 full-power commercial radio and television stations in the U.S., or 3.8 percent. Of these, 426 were commercial radio stations--comprising 4 percent of total commercial radio ownership--while the remaining 23 were commercial television stations, representing 1.9 percent of the country�s 1,288 commercial television licenses. Such figures stand in sharp contrast to the population figures as a whole for 2001, in which minorities represented nearly a third of the total US population. As discouraging as these numbers appear, they are even more disturbing in that over half of the 426 minority-owned radio stations (248) are AM stations, which traditionally have less power and generate less advertising revenue than their FM counterparts. Many minority broadcasters blame their inability to gain sufficient capital, coupled with the skyrocketing costs required to purchase these outlets, for the low numbers of minority FM and television ownership. The numbers for minority ownership of cable networks seem even bleaker, with only one network, Univision (the nation�s most popular Spanish-speaking network) which owns and operates 16 full-power stations in 11 of the top 15 markets in the country, classified as minority owned. (Twenty-five percent of Univision is owned by Venevision, a Venezuelan media company, while another twenty-five percent is owned by Televisa, a Mexican entertainment conglomerate.) Minority ownership in cable television has traditionally been all but nonexistent, in spite of the fact that minorities consume premium cable services at higher rates than whites, since cable provides minorities with more opportunities than does network programming to see themselves and their experiences on television. In fact, in 2000, the NAACP gave the entire cable industry a grade of \"C,\" based on the areas of minority employment, hiring and promotions, service deployment, procurement/vendor relations, advertising/marketing, and charitable activity. And even Robert Johnson, former owner of BET--the only black-owned national cable channel--believes that the future of black cable ownership is bleak. In a recent Financial Times (London) article, Johnson stated that blacks must look to white money in order to scale the U.S. corporate heights. \"You can�t do it as a black-owned business; there isn�t that much capital,\" Johnson said. \"You have to do it as a white-owned business with black management.\" The lack of available resources has led several minority-owned media companies to sell to or merge with mainstream media companies (including the sale of Amistad Press to Harper-Collins; Essence Communications� decision to form a joint venture with Time Inc. in October 2000; Time Warner�s purchase of Africana.com, an Internet portal that provides information on the history, culture and contemporary condition of Africa and its Diaspora, in September 2000; and, most recently, the purchase of BET by Viacom/CBS and Telemundo by GE/NBC this year). Minority consumers have openly protested the sale of minority-owned media to mainstream companies, noting the poor manner in which minorities have historically been portrayed in the media, and expressing the need for minority media owned and operated by minorities themselves. For example, although NBC, since purchasing Telemundo, claims to \"talk to the talk\" of the Hispanic community, the network is in the process of developing a series that will focus on the lives of a family of Mexican drug dealers to air on NBC, and is embarking on an effort to take Telemundo in an increasingly lighter, musical direction, with the development of shows like \"The Roof,\" which will highlight live hip-hop dance performance and music interviews. And since being acquired by Viacom, BET has announced the cancellation of several news programs targeting the African-American community, including \"Teen Summit\" and \"BET Tonight,\" in an effort to focus more on syndicated programming. How Did We Get Here? In 1978, the FCC issued a \"Statement of Policy on Minority Ownership of Broadcast Facilities\" to address what it perceived to be the \"dearth\" of minority broadcast ownership in this country. Of the country�s 8,500 commercial radio and television stations operating at that time, minorities controlled less than one percent, a number that contrasted sharply with minorities� 20 percent representation in the nation�s population at that time. Recognizing that minority participation in the nation�s broadcast industry would result in more diverse programming, the FCC pledged to issue tax credits to broadcasters that agreed to sell their stations to parties \"where minority ownership is in excess of 50 percent or controlling.\" The commission issued 359 tax certificates to promote minority ownership before Congress repealed the program in 1995, citing instances of misuse. Repealing the tax credits was to many minority broadcasters only the beginning of a string of events that would significantly strain their ability to own broadcast stations. In 1996, Congress passed the Telecommunications Act, which removed the limits on the number of radio or television stations under common ownership nationally. The Act also relaxed the One-To-A-Market Rule, which generally prohibited common ownership of radio and television stations in a single market. Many minority broadcasters believe that with the passage of more lenient ownership rules, the rash of media consolidation that followed actually decreased competition and diversity. For example, between 1995 and 2001, the number of individual radio station owners declined by 25 percent. In 1996, Westinghouse, the largest radio owner, owned 85 stations. In 2001, the largest owner, Clear Channel, owned 1,202 stations. Many minority broadcasters, many of whom are single-station owners, believe that it is practically impossible to compete with media conglomerates of this size for listeners, advertisers, or even on-air talent. Minority broadcasters also believe that media consolidation has all but eliminated opportunities they need to expand their media companies. In response to a 2000 Minority Telecommunications Development Program (MTDP) survey, minority respondents noted that \"under present station pricing, expansion is impossible. The Telecommunications Act eliminated the participation and expansion of small entrepreneurs.\" The increase in station prices in many markets, spurred by media consolidation, has left only the largest and wealthiest stations in a position to purchase and expand their media empires. Restricted access to capital, moreover, necessary in order to develop or expand media companies, has long been a complaint of minority broadcasters, and was cited by the MTDP in 1995 as a \"principal barrier to greater participation by minorities in telecommunications ownership.\" Consolidation can impede minority stations even when they may be the top-ranked station in the market. Black broadcasters have lost or are at risk of losing nationally syndicated programming because such programming is being offered to group owners who can reach a larger number of listeners. Losing this programming could result in a loss of ratings, advertisers, and market power. Riding the Next Wave According to representatives of the Black Broadcasters� Alliance, small markets, digital multicasting, and overlooked media companies currently offer the best route for minorities to step into the broadcasting arena. With media consolidation still a major issue, minorities are being asked to consider purchasing low-power TV stations or to settle for providing programming to traditional full-power stations, as a means of gaining entry into broadcast ownership. As conventional broadcast technologies converge with new media, minority broadcasters are also strategizing new ways to develop effective uses for the new technologies to serve existing audiences as well as to attract new audience members. Many of the MTDP survey respondents indicated future plans to begin Internet radio broadcasting if they have not done so already. But the struggle facing minority broadcasters may follow them to the Internet. According to Nielsen NetRatings, the top 20 most-frequently viewed web sites for the week ending Nov. 10, 2002, were as follows:"

      "text": "Minorities Earn Tech Degrees at Twice the Rate Top Companies Hire Them\n\nUSA Today reports that African Americans and Hispanics are graduating from top schools with computer science and computer engineering degrees at twice the rate that tech firms are hiring them. So why are minorities not getting jobs in the tech industry?\n\nThe running excuse has been that there aren't enough minorities graduating with tech-related degrees. But last year, African Americans made up 4.5 percent of graduates with bachelor's degrees in computer science or computer engineering from prestigious research universities; Hispanics made up 6.5 percent. African Americans and Hispanics each made up about 9 percent of 2012 computer science graduates from all U.S. colleges and universities, according to a survey by the National Center for Education Statistics.\n\nOnly 2 percent of workers at seven Silicon Valley companies that released date on their staffs are black or Hispanic. USA Today used data from the Computing Research Association's Taulbee Survey, which includes 179 U.S. and Canadian universities that offer doctorates in computer science and computer engineering.\n\n\"They're reporting 2 percent and 3 percent, and we're looking at graduation numbers [for African Americans and Hispanics] that are maybe twice that,\" said Stuart Zweben, co-author of the study. \"Why are they not getting more of a share of at least the doctoral-granting institutions?\"\n\nUSA Today outlined a few answers to that:\n\nOne of the key problems: There are elite computer science departments that graduate larger numbers of African-American and Hispanic students, but they are not the ones where leading companies recruit employees. Stanford, UC-Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon, UCLA and MIT are among the most popular for recruiting by tech companies, according to research by Wired magazine.\n\n\"That is the major disconnect,\" said Juan Gilbert, a professor of computer and information science at the University of Florida in Gainesville.\n\n\"The premise that if you want diversity, you have to sacrifice quality, is false,\" he said. His department currently has 25 African-American Ph.D. candidates. Rice University in Houston has a large number of Hispanic students.\n\n\"These are very strong programs, top-ranked places that have excellent reputations,\" he said. \"Intel has been hiring from my lab, and they say our students hit it out of the ballpark.\"\n\nEducation is key, too. Google, for example, has \"been working with historically black colleges and universities to elevate coursework and attendance in computer science.\"\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook also believes education is important, explaining in a blog post that education is \"one of the best ways in which Apple can have a meaningful impact on society. We recently pledged $100 million to President Obama's ConnectED initiative to bring cutting-edge technologies to economically disadvantaged schools.\"\n\nThat's fine, but it still doesn't explain why tech firms aren't going beyond Stanford, UC-Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon, UCLA and MIT to find staff. Justin Edmund, an African American designer at Pinterest, said the tech industry needs to rethink how it recruits talent.\n\n\"There's a lot of things that can be done to fix the problem, but a lot of them are things that Silicon Valley and technology companies don't do,\" Edmund said. \"If you go to the same prestigious universities every single time and every single year to recruit people... then you are going to get the same people over and over again.\""

      "text": "How Trump's Bogus Voter Fraud Crusade Could Intimidate Minorities From Voting\n\nIn response to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's baseless claims that there is \"large-scale voter fraud happening on and before election day,\" Univision pointed out the intimidating and deterring effect the claims could have on minority voters.\n\nIn an October 12 article , Univision reported that Donald Trump is galvanizing his supporters to sign up as \"observers\" at polling locations on election day in order to fight back against what he calls \"large-scale voter fraud.\" The claims contradict extensive evidence that demonstrates in-person voter fraud is virtually non-existent. Univision spoke to Latino electorate experts who pointed out that the presence of \"observers\" at polling locations \"intimidates\" and suppresses minority voters. Univision highlighted concerns from Hispanic groups about \"tactics like these\" because they \"generate a hostile environment,\" especially for first-time voters and pointed out that \"Trump's words graze a dangerous line between legal and illegal.\"\n\nWhile this line of attack was initially propagated by right-wing media -- which continue to assist Trump in pushing these false claims -- Univision joins others in condemning these statements as \" bogus \" and \" irresponsible .\" Translated from the Univision article:\n\nDonald Trump has started to spread a new message to his followers: vote and then go to \"other communities\" to make sure \"that no one robs the election from our hands.\" Hispanic leaders fear that the mogul's politics of fear might damage voter turnout.\n\n[...]\n\nEven in the campaign's website, people can sign up to be observers of the elections.\n\nFrom long experience, Hispanic leaders know that this type of tactics intimidate minority voters.\n\n\"We have seen similar strategies before, where they assign people to observe, who basically scare Hispanics and tell them off. Even when they don't say anything, their presence and the way they dress intimidates,\" explained Arturo Vargas, executive director of NALEO.\n\n[...]\n\nVargas insisted that tactics like this \"generate a hostile environment, especially for people who are voting for the first time and that's why it's important for those participating to know their rights.\"\n\nThe director of NALEO also insisted that it's necessary for the Department of Justic to place the largest possible amount of observers in polling places.\n\n[...]\n\nTrump's words graze a dangerous line between legal and illegal.\n\nIn 1982 a decree was issued based on multiple complaints about the intimidation of minority voters between 1970 and 1980.\n\nThe decree specified that the Republican party should not carry out any security activity in voting locations where the ethnic and racial composition is a factor to decide to monitor these areas.\n\nThe order expires in 2017 and can be renewed by the Supreme Court."

      "text": "'Terrible, wrong and brutal for minorities': Appeals court guts Voting Rights Act\n\nLegal experts are sounding the alarm over Monday's Appeals Court ruling they warn \"decimates\" the Voting Rights Act and will be \"brutal\" for minority voters.\n\nIn a 2-to-1 ruling, the highly-conservative Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled private plaintiffs, for example, voters and civil rights groups, do not have the right to sue to have section 2 of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) enforced. Only the U.S. Dept. of Justice, the court ruled, can sue under section 2.\n\n\"It will be a devastating near-death blow to the Voting Rights Act if it remains the law,\" Wendy Weiser, the director of the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, told The New York Times . \"Radical theories that would previously have been laughed out of court have been taken increasingly seriously by an increasingly radical judiciary.\"\n\nThe ruling appears to only apply to the Eight Circuit's jurisdiction, which is Arkansas, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota, NBC News reports.\n\n\"It's hard to overstate how important and detrimental this decision would be if allowed to stand,\" warned UCLA professor of law Rick Hasen, the pre-eminent voice on election law and campaign finance. He added, \"the vast majority of claims to enforce section 2 of the Voting Rights Act are brought by private plaintiffs, not the Department of Justice with limited resources. If minority voters are going to continue to elect representatives of their choice, they are going to need private attorneys to bring those suits.\"\n\nIn his headline Hasen wrote the ruling \"Would Decimate the Rights of Minority Voters; Supreme Court Review Almost Certain.\"\n\nProfessor of law Steve Vladeck, a CNN contributor, noted that not only has the U.S. Supreme Court reviewed section 2 case from private plaintiffs before, it has specified the Voting Rights Act is still operable because private plaintiffs have the ability to sue under section 2. Until now.\n\n\"The 8th Circuit has gutted the last remnants of the Voting Rights Act,\" declared MSNBC legal analyst Joyce Vance, a professor of law and former U.S. Attorney.\n\nNPR called suing under section 2, \"a key path for enforcing the Voting Rights Act.\" Similarly to Hasen, they wrote the ruling \"may set up the next U.S. Supreme Court fight that could further limit the reach of the Voting Rights Act's protections for people of color.\"\n\n\"Private individuals and groups, who did not represent the U.S. government, have for decades brought the majority of Section 2 cases to court,\" NPR added. \"Those cases have challenged the redrawing of voting maps and other steps in the elections process with claims that the voting power of people of color has been minimized.\"\n\nIndeed, Marc Elias, the top Democratic attorney who won all but one of more than 60 lawsuits brought by Trump and his allies in the 2020 election, explained : \"In past 40 years, there have been at least 182 successful Section 2 cases-only 15 were brought solely by DOJ.\"\n\nProfessor of law Eric Segall, author of \"Originalism as Faith,\" and \"Supreme Myths: Why the Supreme Court Is Not a Court and Its Justices Are Not Judges,\" issued a dire warning .\n\n\"Terrible, wrong and brutal for minorities,\" Segall called it, noting that in that ruling the Eight Circuit was \"trying to finish what Justice Roberts and Judge Bill Pryor wanted for decades: the eventual judicial repeal of the entire VRA.\"\n\nMonday's ruling was written by a Trump-appointed judge, and upholds a lower court ruling also written by a Trump-appointed judge.\n\n\"Jesus Christ,\" exclaimed The Nation's justice correspondent Elie Mystal. \"This is THE WAY the Voting Rights Act works. It's THE WAY we enforce the 15th freaking amendment. I think [Chief Justice John] Roberts and [Justice Amy Coney] Barrett will join the liberals to reverse this when it gets to SCOTUS, but my God, letting Trump judges on the federal bench was a terrible plan.\""

(AP Photo/Mahmud Hossain Opu)\n\nDHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) - Bangladesh's largest minority rights group accused the country's interim government on Thursday of failing to protect religious and ethnic minorities from attacks and harassment , a claim the government has denied.\n\nThe Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council said the government headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus is also using state institutions to suppress minority groups. Yunus took over after a student-led uprising last year in which hundreds of people died forced former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to flee to India on Aug. 5, ending her 15-year rule.\n\nThe council earlier said 2,010 incidents of communal violence took place across the Muslim-majority country between Aug. 4 and 20. The Yunus-led government disputed the claim, saying that most of the incidents were caused by \"political reasons\" and not by communal issues.\n\nTraditionally, Hindus and other members of minority groups have been seen as supporters of Hasina's Bangladesh Awami League party.\n\nIn a news conference on Thursday, the council reiterated its claim of earlier attacks and said 174 new incidents of communal violence had taken place between Aug. 21 and Dec. 31 last year in which 23 members of minority groups were killed and nine women were raped. It said other incidents involved arson, vandalism, looting and forcible takeover of property and businesses. It said at least 15 members of minority groups were either arrested or tortured for allegedly undermining Islam.\n\nManindra Kumar Nath, the group's acting general secretary, accused the government of manipulating state institutions to harass people from minority groups.\n\n\"We have observed that the interim government has begun using various important state institutions to carry out discriminatory actions against minorities. This is unexpected and undesirable from a government that was established based on the anti-discrimination student movement,\" he said.\n\nThe council said minority groups were being targeted in a systematic way, and called for the release of a jailed Hindu leader .\n\nNath said the leader, Chinmoy Das Prabhu, was being deprived of his legal right to bail in a sedition case. He is also known as Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari.\n\nNath said many minority leaders had gone into hiding because of false charges against them. The interim government has said they face specific charges and were not targeted for any communal reason.\n\nUnder Yunus, Bangladesh has been going through a tense period with Hindu-majority India over minority issues, sparking protests and counter-protests . Less than 8% of Bangladesh's 170 million people are Hindu. Many in the interim government are unhappy that India is sheltering Hasina, and a special tribunal in Bangladesh has sought her arrest. An official request to India for her extradition remains unanswered.\n\nIndia, which sheltered 10 million refugees and helped Bangladesh gain independence after a nine-month war against Pakistan in 1971, considers Hasina to be a trusted friend. Hasina's father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, was the independence leader of Bangladesh, then the eastern part of Pakistan, India's regional foe.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

The tweet is fabricated.\n\nTHE FACTS: A fake tweet made to appear it came from Biden's official Twitter account @JoeBiden circulated on social media following remarks he made at a CNN town hall on Feb. 16.\n\nThe phony tweet that was shared as an image on social media states: \"My comment regarding minorities not being able to use the internet was taken out of context. It's not they don't know how to use it it's just that they don't know any better. Those people don't know about computers because they lack the resources, education and their overall commitment in their communities. It's not that they're dumb it's just they don't like to do anything. Hope this clears that up.\"\n\nMultiple Facebook users shared the bogus tweet. \"I am going to assume that all those minorities that voted for him are okay with how he thinks about minorities,\" wrote one Facebook user who shared the false post.\n\nThe tweet cannot be found on Biden's Twitter account or ProPublica's database Politwoops that tracks tweets deleted by public officials.\n\nDuring a CNN town hall last week with journalist Anderson Cooper, Biden responded to a question about how his administration will tackle racial disparities in the COVID-19 vaccine response.\n\nThere are fewer Black Americans being vaccinated than whites, AP reporting has found. Experts have cited several factors that could contribute to the emerging disparity, such as a deep-rooted mistrust of the medical establishment among Black Americans due to a history of discriminatory treatment. Predominantly Black neighborhoods have inadequate access to the vaccine, and a digital divide makes it difficult for people to get crucial information, especially when vaccination sign-ups are largely being done online.\n\nIn his response , Biden talked about access to the vaccine being a physical obstacle for marginalized communities and said some people lack the internet access needed to get key information.\n\n\"A lot of people don't know how to register,\" Biden stated. \"Not everybody in the community - in the Hispanic and the African American community, particularly in rural areas that are distant and/or inner-city districts - know how to use - know how to get online to determine how to get in line for that COVID vaccination at the Walgreens or at the particular store,\" Biden responded.\n\nThose comments were widely circulated on social media. Some Facebook users then began sharing an image of the made-up tweet Biden supposedly posted.\n\n___\n\nThis is part of The Associated Press' ongoing effort to fact-check misinformation that is shared widely online, including work with Facebook to identify and reduce the circulation of false stories on the platform.\n\nHere's more information on Facebook's fact-checking program: https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Petr David Josek, File)\n\nPARIS (AP) - They are Nabil, Amine, François and more. But they will not be seen around the Paris Olympics , because France's government barred them from getting anywhere close.\n\nFrench authorities are making unprecedentedly broad use of discretionary powers under an anti-terror law to keep hundreds of people they deem to be potential security threats away from the biggest event modern France has ever organized.\n\nMinorities - largely with backgrounds in former French colonies - are often among those forbidden from leaving their neighborhoods and required to report daily to police, their lawyers say. Some are alarmed by the sweeping use of what one described as \"a terribly dangerous tool.\"\n\nSome of those now restricted in their movements, with orders that don't require prior approval from judges, include a man who had mental health issues in the past but is now receiving treatment. There also is an apprentice bank worker and business student who believes he's been targeted in part because he's Muslim and his father was born in Morocco, plus a halal food delivery driver who risks losing his job because he is banned from straying far from home during the 2024 Olympics and ensuing Paralympics, their lawyers say.\n\nAP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports Olympics security means minorities and other potential terror suspects are having their freedom of movement curtailed.\n\nFrench Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin says the restrictions aim to prevent \"very dangerous\" people from attacking the Games.\n\nDarmanin says he's applied them to more than 500 people this year as part of France's security preparations for the Games and the Olympic torch relay that preceded the July 26 opening ceremony .\n\nThose affected include Amine, the bank apprentice now forbidden from leaving his suburb south of Paris - except to report at 6:30 p.m. daily to a local police station. The France-born 21-year-old has no criminal record and has not been charged with any crime, he and his lawyer say.\n\nAmine believes French intelligence services have mistaken him for someone else who posted decapitation images and threats against LGBTQ+ people on a video-sharing app. The Associated Press is not identifying Amine by his full name because he fears potential employers and schools may reject him if they learn that police flagged him as a threat.\n\n\"I am not dangerous for France. I am not a terrorist. I am just a student who works to finance his studies,\" Amine said in an interview at his studio apartment strewn with books and with family photos on the fridge.\n\nPolice visited twice in the last four months. They busted down a neighbor's door the first time, seemingly because they had the wrong address, and then seized Amine's phone and computer, which made boning up for his exams harder, he said. The second time, a month before the Games, was to notify him that he could no longer move around freely.\n\n\"If my name was Brian, if I was blond and blue-eyed, the situation would have been different. Except that it is not the case. I am a North African Muslim, and I've been targeted in France,\" he said.\n\nFearing terror attacks, French authorities have massively ramped up security for the Games , flooding Paris streets with up to 45,000 police, plus soldiers armed with assault rifles , and tasking intelligence services to identify and neutralize potential threats in advance.\n\nInterior Ministry notes seen by AP say security services foiled several alleged terror plots ahead of the Games, with Olympic soccer matches , an LGBTQ+ night club and France's Jewish community among suspected targets. The ministry's notes also say the Israel-Hamas war has heightened the terror risk in France , which has the largest Muslim and Jewish communities in Europe.\n\nThe anti-terror preventive effort also includes the liberal use of police powers to restrict the movements of people the ministry deems to be potential threats. The measures can only be challenged afterward in court, which some of those affected are now doing - a few successfully.\n\nThe powers were part of reinforced anti-terror legislation that sped through both houses of parliament in 2017, when France was still reeling from attacks by al-Qaida and Islamic State gunmen and suicide bombers in 2015.\n\nThe attacks killed 147 people - including in Paris neighborhoods now teeming with Olympic visitors and outside what is now the Olympic stadium, hosting track and field and rugby sevens.\n\nThe anti-terror law empowers France's interior minister to restrict anyone's movements when there are \"serious reasons\" to believe they're a grave security threat and have terror ties or sympathies.\n\nThe power the interior minister is using to distance people from the Olympics by forcing them to stay close to home is called an \"individual measure of administrative control and surveillance,\" known by the French acronym, MICAS.\n\nDarmanin told reporters last week that \"just under 200\" of the more than 500 Olympic-related MICAS cases he ordered this year are still in force during the Games.\n\nThey have been applied to people with \"possible\" extremist links who served jail time and others who weren't sentenced but \"represent a danger for us,\" he said.\n\n\"We have evidence or very important suspicions that they are radicalized and could prepare an attack,\" the interior minister said.\n\nParis' chief of police, Laurent Nuñez described the restrictions' wide use as \"extremely positive.\"\n\n\"We must use the full range of legal and administrative tools at our disposal, which is what the interior minister asked for,\" he said last week as he toured the venue for Olympic table tennis , weightlifting, handball and volleyball.\n\n\"He asked us to further tighten the net as we approached the Olympic Games, and that is what we did,\" Nuñez said.\n\nAP spoke to six lawyers for about 20 people whose movements have been restricted. Some said they understand the measures' use for Olympic security, while others say the powers are being applied too broadly.\n\nThe use of the restrictions for the Olympics appears unprecedented in scope, some lawyers say. While over 500 people saw their movements curtailed this year and Darmanin says it's now less than 200 remaining during the Games, that compares with 205 people subjected to MICAS restrictions in the first 26 months of the 2017 law going into effect, according to a French Senate report from 2020 .\n\n\"It's really directly connected to the Olympic Games,\" said Paris attorney Margot Pugliese. She described the powers as \"a horror\" and \"really the total failure of the rule of law\" because they can only be contested in court after they have been applied.\n\n\"It is a terribly dangerous tool whenever there is a repressive government,\" Pugliese said.\n\nLawyers say some of their clients have no prior convictions and only tenuous links to suspected extremism. Of the lawyers AP spoke to, about half of their clients have immigrant backgrounds , mostly with family roots in North Africa.\n\nDarmanin says minorities aren't being singled out and that people suspected of left- or right-wing extremism are under surveillance, too.\n\n\"What would the French people say, what would the world say, if people who we can suspect might carry out actions, who are radicalized, are left perfectly free and then commit attacks?\" he asked.\n\nParis attorney Antoine Ory has represented three people hit by MICAS restrictions in the Olympics run-up - two of them with no criminal records. One was born in Madagascar; the other two are French Algerian and French Moroccan dual nationals.\n\nOne of the men completed a five-year sentence for terror-related offenses in 2021, which included four months of jail time and other periods of semi-liberty or with an electronic bracelet to flag his whereabouts, Ory says. The MICAS order bans him from leaving his northeastern suburb of Paris.\n\nOry says police intelligence used to justify restrictions for his two other clients was flimsy at best. He alleges that intelligence services dipped back into old information they long had at their disposal, targeting people who before the Games weren't deemed enough of a risk to warrant MICAS orders.\n\n\"It's extremely abusive,\" he said. \"Two weeks before the Games, they come along and say, 'You're dangerous.'\"\n\nA week before the Olympic opening ceremony , Ory successfully overturned the MICAS order for his Madagascar-born client. A court southeast of Paris ruled that the Interior Ministry failed to prove that the man is a terror risk and ordered the state to pay him 1,500 euros ($1,600).\n\nA note from police intelligence services - seen by AP - that requested movement restrictions and daily police check-ins for Amine from July 1 to the Sept. 8 closing of the Paralympics cited \"the particularly serious threat he represents to public security and order, his adherence to radical Islam, and the specific context of the terrorist threat in the framework of the organization of the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games.\"\n\nThe note flagged a TikTok video that Amine posted on Oct. 10 of himself in front of the Eiffel Tower, which was lit in Israeli colors following the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel by Hamas militants. Wearing the shirt of Deportivo Palestino, a Chilean soccer club founded by Palestinians, and the motorcycle helmet he'd worn on his ride to the tower, Amine then posted photos of himself making obscene gestures at the monument.\n\nIn hindsight, \"it wasn't the best idea I've ever had,\" he acknowledges. Amine says he was frustrated that French authorities at the time were banning pro-Palestinian protests. \"It seemed like a lack of impartiality to me,\" he said.\n\nHe also posted an image of himself with one finger pointing at the badge on his shirt and another pointing at the Star of David illuminating the tower. The intelligence services' MICAS request described the raised finger as a sign of allegiance to Allah.\n\nAmine says he was copying soccer players he's seen raise fingers in celebration when they score goals. \"But when it's them, it's not a problem,\" he said.\n\nThe police note also tied Amine to an account on the video-sharing app Rave, saying the user posted decapitation images and \"worrying comments\" that expressed a desire to join a terror group and kill LGBTQ+ people. The note alleged that Amine \"does not hide his anti-Zionist and homophobic positions.\"\n\nAmine told AP that the Rave account isn't his. He filed a police complaint in May that the account's user had stolen his identity.\n\n\"I am not at all anti-Zionist, homophobic or anything. All those ideas are alien to me,\" Amine said.\n\nThe MICAS order - seen by AP - that bars Amine from leaving his Paris suburb except for his daily police check-in warns that he risks three years in prison and a fine of 45,000 euros ($48,600) if he violates the restrictions or fails to check in.\n\nStuck at home or close to it, Amine says each day is like the last. He can watch the Paris Olympics only on TV.\n\nAnd although the Olympic opening ceremony celebrated France's freedoms, Amine feels that its promises of \"liberté, egalité, fraternité\" aren't being applied to him.\n\n\"I have neither liberty, nor fraternity towards me,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nAP video journalists Ahmed Hatem, Alex Turnbull and Jeffrey Schaeffer and Special Projects and Operations manager Thomas Rowley contributed.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Time to retool census? Some think so after minorities missed\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nFILE - Census Bureau Director nominee Robert Santos, testifies before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committee, Thursday, July 15, 2021, on Capitol Hill in Washington. Santos said Monday, Feb. 21, 2022, that he has gone on a listening tour with stakeholders and the agency is making permanent community outreach efforts in an effort to restore any trust that was lost following attempts by the Trump administration to politicize the nation's head count. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File)\n\nIs it time to rethink the census and other surveys that measure changes in the U.S. population?\n\nPolicymakers and demographers have been asking that question since results released by the U.S. Census Bureau this month showed Black, Hispanic, American Indian and other minority residents were undercounted at greater rates in 2020 than in the previous decade.\n\nOn the top of that, results from a version of its most comprehensive survey that compares year-to-year changes in U.S. life had to be mostly scrapped because disruptions caused by the pandemic produced fewer responses in 2020.\n\n\"The current model of coming up with a master address list, mailing everybody an invitation - like you're inviting people to a party and hoping they respond, and if not, you're going to track them down - I think it's an obsolete system,\" said Arturo Vargas, CEO of NALEO Educational Fund, a nonpartisan nonprofit that supports Latino political engagement.\n\nThe undercounts in the 2020 census were blamed on the pandemic, natural disasters and political interference from the Trump administration, but undercounts of racial and ethnic minorities are nothing new to the census; they've been persistent for decades.\n\nIn recent years, the cost of censuses and surveys have grown while public participation rates for surveys have declined. The bureau's biggest between-census effort to take the measure of the U.S. population, the American Community Survey, produces 11 billion statistics from interviews with 3.5 million households each year, and the once-a-decade census tallies every U.S. resident for a count used in divvying up federal funding and congressional seats among the states as well as redrawing political districts.\n\n\"What we have today largely is still a 20th century, survey-centric statistical system,\" Ron Jarmin, the chief operating officer of the Census Bureau, said last December when he was serving as the agency's acting director.\n\nEven before the release of the 2020 report card earlier this month, the Census Bureau had been developing new ways of gathering data. Chief among them is the embryonic Frames Program that would combine all kinds of data sets, including administrative records from the private sector and government agencies, as well as surveys and censuses that have been staples of Census Bureau data-gathering for decades.\n\nUnder the concept, one data set such as an individual's IRS file would be linked to another, such as the individual's Census Bureau survey response. Eventually, data related to people's addresses, demographics, businesses and jobs would all be linked together.\n\nIn 2030, when the next census takes place, the program could help count people with good administrative records or links to other records, and more resources could be devoted toward households that are the hardest to count, Census Bureau Director Robert Santos said in a recent interview with The Associated Press.\n\n\"We are looking to take advantage of existing technology, and that necessarily includes the merging of large databases on people, not to create a Big Brother society, but to supplement and reduce the burden on our population when it comes time to gather data,\" said Santos, who was appointed by President Joe Biden.\n\nRelying on administrative records may have its own problems because some groups, such as people in the country illegally, often have little paper trail.\n\nBesides naming an unusually high number of political appointees to the Census Bureau, the Trump administration unsuccessfully attempted to use administrative records to get a tally of the number of people in the country illegally so they could be eliminated from the count used for allocating congressional seats.\n\nAny effort to revamp how the count is conducted will need to be protected from similar efforts to misuse the count for political purposes, said Paul Ong, a professor emeritus of urban studies at UCLA.\n\n\"The 2020 enumeration was a wakeup call,\" Ong said. \"The Census Bureau has a very important and fundamental function in our society. It is the keeper of our demographic truths.\"\n\nFrom a purely civic perspective, Terri Ann Lowenthal, a former congressional staffer who specializes in census issues, worries a greater reliance on administrative records at the expense of public participation will be one less thing that engages everyone in the U.S., no matter their background.\n\n\"If you are in a millionaire's mansion or living in a tent under a bridge, you matter to the census,\" Lowenthal said.\n\nThe Census Bureau has been at the forefront of advances in data gathering and processing - whether using punch cards and electronic tabulators at the end of the 19th century or employing the first modern computer installed by a civilian government agency for the 1950 census. For the 2020 census, it tried several new approaches.\n\nFor the first time, the internet was the primary mode for answering the census questionnaire, and the 2020 census was the first to use administrative records from places like the Social Security Administration to fill in data gaps for households that didn't respond. Bureau statisticians also are blending other data sets with census data for the first time to create yearly population estimates.\n\nThe Census Bureau could improve the accuracy of the undercounted communities if Congress would allow it to use a statistical method that adjusts the population count to compensate for undercounts, Lowenthal said. That statistical tool has been prohibited for the count used for dividing congressional seats among the states for more than two decades.\n\nOutreach to overlooked communities and more consistent funding from Congress also needs to be in the mix, said Allison Plyer, chief demographer of The Data Center in New Orleans.\n\n\"There isn't going to be a silver bullet,\" said Plyer, former chair of the bureau's scientific advisory committee. \"All of these things need to work together in concert.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow Mike Schneider on Twitter at https://twitter.com/MikeSchneiderAP\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

About a third of the female service members in the Air Force and Space Force say they've experienced sexual harassment and many can describe accounts of sexism and a negative stigma associated with pregnancy and maternity leave, a study released Thursday, Sept. 9, has found. The review, done by the Air Force Inspector General, also concluded that minorities and females are underrepresented in leadership and officer positions, particularly at the senior levels, and get promoted less frequently.

(Olivier Douliery/Pool Photo via AP)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - About a third of the female service members in the Air Force and Space Force say they've experienced sexual harassment and many can describe accounts of sexism and a stigma associated with pregnancy and maternity leave, a study released Thursday has found.\n\nThe review, done by the Air Force inspector general, also concluded that minorities and women are underrepresented in leadership and officer positions, particularly at the senior levels, and get promoted less frequently. It echoed many of the findings of an initial review, released last December, which found that Black service members in the Air Force are far more likely to be investigated, arrested, face disciplinary actions and be discharged for misconduct.\n\nThe two reviews into racial, ethnic and gender disparities across the Air Force and Space Force broadly confirm that biases exist, but the data does not fully explain why. The studies also reflect broader campaigns within the Defense Department and the Biden administration to root out extremism and racism.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has declared domestic extremism an urgent national security threat and the Defense Department is working to identify extremist behavior and eliminate it from the force. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, earlier this year, ordered military leaders to spend a day talking to their troops about extremism in the ranks, after a number of former and current military members took part in the assault on the U.S. Capitol in January.\n\nIn addition, the Defense Department late last year endorsed a slate of initiatives to more aggressively recruit, retain and promote a more racially and ethnically diverse force.\n\n\"There are a lot of disparities within the Air Force,\" said Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall in a call with reporters. \"This includes things like promotions, how people are treated in their careers, how they're treated in assignments, other areas under the judicial system, if you will, and also about perceptions that people have.\"\n\nIn the latest study, about half of all female respondents said maintaining work/life balance and taking care of family commitments adversely affect them, while only 18% of men responding to the survey shared that view.\n\nIt also found that about 25% of female Air Force and Space Force civilians said they had experienced sexual harassment during their careers. And it said some women across the force didn't trust their chain of command to address the bad behavior, and feared retribution.\n\nWomen and minorities also said they believe they have to work harder to prove their competency.\n\nWhile the first study looked at disparities for Black service members, the latest one involved women, Asian, American Indian/Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander and Hispanic/Latino personnel in active duty, the National Guard, Reserves and civilian workforce.\n\nAs a result, the report said, thousands of female and minority Air and Space Force members reported instances of bias, discrimination and sexual harassment that contribute to the racial, ethnic and gender disparities laid out in the document.\n\nLt. Gen. Sami Said, the inspector general, told reporters that some of the largest gaps are in operational jobs, which include pilots and other combat-related posts. As an example, in 2020, nearly 84% of the pilots in the active duty Air Force were white., and more than 92% were male. In contrast, 7.7% were female, 3% were Hispanic/Latino, 2.7% were Asian American, 2% were Black, 0.5% were Native American and 0.3% were Pacific Islander.\n\nThe problem, according to Said, starts with recruiting. A common theme in surveys and group discussions, he said, was that women and minorities believe there is a \"lack of people that look like us that can mentor us and advise us.\"\n\nBecause they aren't brought in to key operational jobs at decent rates, they are at a disadvantage when competing with others for promotions and better jobs.\n\nIn addition, the report found that Native Americans were 113% more likely to face a court-martial than their White peers, and that they and Hispanic/Latino Air Force members were 33% more likely to face criminal investigations.\n\nThe second report released Thursday laid out some of the ongoing efforts to address shortfalls found in the December review on bias against Blacks. It also found they were less likely to be promoted and that one-third believed they don't get the same opportunities as their white peers.\n\nIt said the Air Force is working to increase diversity awareness among recruiters and expand partnerships with institutions that have large minority populations to beef up recruiting. That effort would include directing more minorities to key career fields that have a greater opportunity for advancement.\n\nThe Air Force also has set up new policies to track administrative actions based on age, rank, gender and race, and it recommended more training for commanders and other key leaders on unconscious bias.\n\nSaid told reporters that he is \"100% convinced\" that senior leaders are focused on the diversity issue.\n\n\"It's not a shiny object of the moment that fades,\" he said.\n\nMore than 100,500 individuals participated in the anonymous survey for the latest gender and minority study. The participants also turned in more than 16,900 single-spaced pages of other comments and were involved in 122 small-group discussions.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nSARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) - A top European court ruled in an opinion published Tuesday that Bosnia's political system, set up under a U.S.-brokered peace deal in 1995, amplifies ethnic divisions and undermines the Balkan country's democratic elections.\n\nThe European Court of Human Rights, ECHR, sided with Slaven Kovacevic, a Sarajevo-born political scientist, who sued Bosnia last year arguing that it prevents people who refuse to affiliate with one of Bosnia's three dominant ethnic groups from voting for candidates of their choosing.\n\nTuesday's verdict is the latest in a stream of the ECHR rulings ordering Bosnia to make its constitution less discriminatory. The country's failure to comply with those verdicts by amending its constitution is a stumbling block on Bosnia's path towards its stated goal of joining the European Union.\n\nIn the summary of its verdict, the court ruled that Bosnia's power-sharing arrangements have turned the country into an \"ethnocracy\" in which ethnicity, and not citizenship, is the key to securing power and resources.\n\nBosnia's dominant ethnic groups -- Muslim Bosniaks, Orthodox Serbs and Catholic Croats -- \"control the state institutions to further their interest.\" Meanwhile, the court ruled, the country's nationals who belong to the minority groups or reject ethnic nationalism are \"akin to second-class citizens.\"\n\nThe 1995 Dayton peace agreement was aimed at ending the war in Bosnia that killed 100,000 people and drove some 2 million from their homes. Under its terms, the country was divided into two semi-autonomous governing entities - Republika Srpska and the Federation dominated by Bosniaks and Croats. Each has its own government, parliament and police, but the two are linked by shared, state-wide institutions, including the three-person presidency and the bicameral national parliament.\n\nThe constitution states that the candidates for the national presidency and the shared parliament's upper chamber, which has to approve all legislation, must identify as ethnic Serbs, Croats or Bosniaks and that the two must be divided equally among the three groups. All others are excluded.\n\nAdditionally, only the residents of Bosnia's Serb-run part are entitled to vote for the candidates for the two top offices who declare affiliation with Serbs and only the residents of the Federation for those who affiliate with Croats and Bosniaks.\n\nThe sectarian system of governance perpetuates a venomous political climate that allows the long-entrenched nationalist leaders to enrich their allies and leaves reform-minded Bosnians without the right to run for top offices and with little incentive to vote.\n\nHuman Rights Watch, the global rights group, estimated in 2019 that 400,000 Bosnian nationals - or 12% of the country's population - has been barred from running for their country's presidency or the upper chamber of its national parliament because of their religion, ethnicity, or where they live.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nLONDON (AP) - A new study by Public Health England has confirmed that historic racism and social inequalities are contributing factors that increase the risk of black, Asian and minority communities contracting and dying from the coronavirus in the U.K.\n\nBritain's government has been under heavy pressure to do more to directly address the issue after data consistently showed that coronavirus death rates were significantly higher for blacks and ethnic minorities compared to white people.\n\nThe report, published Tuesday, didn't look at genetic factors, but said it was clear that the pandemic \"exposed and exacerbated longstanding inequalities\" in the country. Relevant factors included \"racism, discrimination and stigma, occupational risk, inequalities in the prevalence of conditions that increase the severity of disease including obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and asthma.''\n\nCiting a strong association between economic disadvantage and COVID-19 diagnoses, it said black people and minority groups are more at risk because they are more likely to live in cramped housing, use public transportation and work in jobs with a higher risk of virus exposure.\n\nIt added that historic racism and poorer experiences of health care or at work meant that minority groups are less likely to seek care, or demand better protective equipment at work.\n\n\"Lack of trust of NHS (National Health Service) and healthcare treatment resulted in their reluctance to seek care on a timely basis, and late presentation with disease,\" the paper said.\n\nThe report said officials should start more comprehensive collection of ethnicity health data and ensure ethnicity is recorded in death certificates. It also recommended targeted messaging on smoking, obesity and improving management of common health conditions like diabetes.\n\nThe report's release has been controversial. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government has been accused of holding back the material when it published an earlier report on the issue.\n\nThe first report looked at why black people and ethnic communities may be at higher risk from COVID-19, but made no recommendations and made no reference to the 17 sessions in which around 4,000 people offered insight on the issue.\n\nTuesday's report said that those consulted \"expressed deep dismay, anger, loss and fear in their communities about the emerging data and realities of black, Asian and minority ethnic groups being harder hit by the COVID-19 pandemic than others.\"\n\nAmitava Banerjee, associate professor in clinical data science at University College London, said that overall the disproportionate impact on minorities is \"due not only to racism, but much more to do with ethnic inequalities in the social and economic determinants of health, which require urgent action.\"\n\nOn Monday, Johnson announced a commission to look at what more can be done to fight racial inequality in the U.K. Thousands protested across the country for two weekends in demonstrations spurred by the May 25 death of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP pandemic coverage at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - Some organizations representing minority journalists say they're worried that outlets reporting on their communities will be left behind in a recently-announced $500 million initiative aimed at boosting the struggling local news industry.\n\nThey urged that Press Forward Initiative, a group of 20 funders led by the Knight and MacArthur Foundations, to more explicitly commit to funding these outlets, particularly those run by minorities.\n\n\"They're sort of skirting around it,\" said Martin Reynolds, co-executive director of the Robert C. Maynard Institute for Journalism Education, on Tuesday.\n\nIn announcing the $500 million pledge two weeks ago, the funders said they wanted to \"move resources to newsrooms and organizations that are improving diversity of experience and thought,\" as well as into underserved communities.\n\n\"We deeply value diversity within news ecosystems, recognizing that it is required for the optimal functioning of democracy,\" said Jim Brady, the Knight Foundation's vice president of journalism. \"Knight's grantmaking has shown that commitment to diversity, which will absolutely continue with Press Forward.\"\n\nReynolds pointed to research showing that philanthropists tended to favor organizations run by whites for funding, more than minorities, and are more apt to put restrictions on the use of grants given to non-whites.\n\nHe said he's also concerned that the U.S. Supreme Court decision in June striking down affirmative action in college admissions will make funders less willing to make racial equity a priority in decisions about where to spend.\n\nA recent survey by the National Trust for Local News found that 53% of leaders at community media outlets that serve specific racial or ethnic communities said their organizations were likely to go out of business within five years based on how things were going for them financially.\n\nThe letter to Press Forward sent on Tuesday was signed by the Asian American Journalists Association, the Indigenous Journalists Association, the National Association of Black Journalists and the National Association of Hispanic Journalists.\n\nLocal news in the U.S. has been decimated over the past two decades by a collapse in advertising, leading many newspapers to close or operate in a \"ghost\" state. Some philanthropies have stepped up in recent years to try and fill the gaps.\n\nThe organizations that spoke out on Tuesday said they \"didn't hesitate to applaud\" when the latest funding initiative was announced, and pleased that \"improving diversity of experience and thought\" was set as part of the mission.\n\n\"As this initiative unfolds and decisions are made about where support is directed, we want to be clear: racial and ethnic diversity, equity and belonging must be among the pillars of its foundation,\" the letter said.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nWhite liberals present themselves as less competent when addressing minorities, while conservatives use the same vocabulary no matter what the race of their audience, according to a newly released study.\n\nYale and Princeton researchers found that both white Democratic presidential candidates and self-identified liberals played down their competence when speaking to minorities, using fewer words that conveyed accomplishment and more words that expressed warmth.\n\nOn the other hand, there were no significant differences in how white conservatives, including Republican presidential candidates, spoke to white versus minority audiences.\n\n\"White liberals self-present less competence to minorities than to other Whitesthat is, they patronize minorities stereotyped as lower status and less competent,\" according to the study's abstract.\n\nCydney Dupree, Yale School of Management assistant professor of organizational behavior, said she was surprised by the findings of the study, which sought to discover how \"well-intentioned whites\" interact with minorities.\n\n\"It was kind of an unpleasant surprise to see this subtle but persistent effect,\" Ms. Dupree said. \"Even if it's ultimately well-intentioned, it could be seen as patronizing.\"\n\nThe study flies in the face of a standard talking point of the political leftthat white conservatives are racistwhile raising questions about whether liberals are perpetuating racial stereotypes about blacks being less competent than whites.\n\nThe paper, which is slated for publication in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, first examined speeches by Republican and Democratic presidential candidates to mostly white and mostly minority audiences dating back 25 years.\n\nMs. Dupree and Princeton's Susan Fiske analyzed the text for \"words related to competence,\" such as \"assertive\" and \"competitive,\" and \"words related to warmth,\" such as \"supportive\" and \"compassionate.\"\n\n\"The team found that Democratic candidates used fewer competence-related words in speeches delivered to mostly minority audiences than they did in speeches delivered to mostly white audiences,\" said the Yale press release. \"The difference wasn't statistically significant in speeches by Republican candidates.\"\n\nMs. Dupree noted that Republicans also gave fewer speeches to minority audiences.\n\nThe researchers then set up an experiment in which white liberals were asked to respond to hypothetical individuals named \"Emily\" and \"Lakisha.\"\n\n\"[L]iberal individuals were less likely to use words that would make them appear highly competent when the person they were addressing was presumed to be black rather than white,\" said the release. \"No significant differences were seen in the word selection of conservatives based on the presumed race of their partner.\"\n\nMs. Dupree said the \"competence downshift\" could indicate a greater eagerness by white liberals to connect with those of other races.\n\n\"My hope is that this work will help include well-intentioned people who see themselves as allies but who may be unwittingly contributing to group divides,\" said Ms. Dupree. \"There is a broader need to include them in the conversation.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Minority: A Word Without Meaning?\n\nIf any political pundit had said in 2012 that Mitt Romney would win the white vote by a 20-point margin over President Barack Obama and still lose the election, they might have been drummed out of the prediction business. But thatâs what happened, and it signaled one of the most significant demographic shifts in U.S. history.\n\nâIn the first half of this century, minorities will be just as important as the baby boomers were in the last half of the 20th century,â says Brookings Institution demographer William Frey, the author of Diversity Explosion . âThey are the future of our labor force and the future of our voting population.â\n\nAlmost half a century has passed since the Immigration and Nationality Act encouraged a wave of migration from Asia and Latin America in the â70s, â80s, and â90s. That change in the makeup of the U.S. population has had consequences for everything from popular music to school curricula. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, children of minorities already outnumber non-Hispanic whites in more than a hundred U.S. cities. By the election of 2028, racial and ethnic minorities are expected to constitute a majority of adults ages 18 to 29 for the first time. By 2035, non-Hispanic whites will be outnumbered across all age groups.\n\nâIt will be very different from anything weâve ever seen before,â says Frey. âRacial minorities were always a pretty small part of the population up until about 20 years ago, when we started getting more immigrants into the U.S. Minorities were mostly black, they were mostly living in segregated cities, they were out of the mainstream and out of peopleâs daily consciousness. That is no longer the case.â\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Centerâs analysis of census data, 78 counties in 19 statesâfrom California to Kansas to North Carolinaâhave already shifted from being majority white to having no single racial or ethnic group in the majority.\n\nPeople are also marrying across racial and ethnic lines as never before. According to the 2010 census, 15 percent of new marriages were between spouses of a different race or ethnicity, up from 6.7 percent in 1980. Frey expects this trend to continue, with significant social and political implications.\n\nâIn our history, race has been a sharp division of people all across the age structure, and all across the nation,â Frey says. âIf we can open things up to having more interracial marriage, more people accepting each other as neighbors, that flares into politics as well.â\n\nIn the U.S., minorities typically lean liberal. According to a 2014 Pew Research poll, 64 percent of blacks identify as Democrats, and large majorities of Asians and Hispanics identify as either Democrats or Independents. Beyond the effect on presidential elections, an increase in minority voters could lead to changes in policy.\n\nâA big message of what is going on in racial demographics is that people will come to realize that the next generation of young people need to have all of the access they can to a good education, to a good middle-class life, and that will take government support,â Frey says. âThey need to have this assistance for all of us to succeed.â\n\nResearch by Jan Germen Janmaat at the University of London has found that ethnic diversity in the classroom actually leads to greater tolerance toward immigrants among teens, and Mark Hugo Lopez, the director of Hispanic research at the Pew Research Center, wonders whether the concept of diversity will even exist in 10 years.\n\nâI do think that you might see something similar to attitudes about interracial marriages,â Lopez says. âIn the 1960s and â70s, there were many Americans who would say on a public-opinion survey that people of different races marrying each other is a bad thing for society. Boomers and Gen Xers would say it is a good thing for society. Millennials would say it really doesnât make much of a difference.\n\nNational Population Projections - US Census\n\nMinorities and U.S. Population Growth - Pew\n\nFor Prudentialâs take on more aspects of our individual and common futures, go to BringYourChallenges .\n\nâThatâs where we may go with diversityâit may become so commonplace that people arenât looking at each other wondering what their ethnic background and roots are. Theyâll just see people as having different backgrounds and leave it at that.â\n\nNext: The Many New Faces of the American Family\n\nSponsor Content by Atlantic Re:think, The Atlantic 's creative marketing group\n\nSupport 160 years of independent journalism.\n\nTheAtlantic.com Copyright (c) 2019 by The Atlantic Monthly Group.

      "text": "How Donald Trump Speaks to-and About-Minorities\n\nDoes the presumptive Republican nominee see African Americans and Hispanics as part of the American \"we\"?\n\nCelebrating his big win in Indiana -and his elevation to presumptive nominee of the Republican Party-Tuesday night, Donald Trump spoke at Trump Tower in New York City, where he delivered a promise to heal the deep fractures in his party.\n\n\"We want to bring unity to the Republican Party,\" he said. \"We have to bring unity. It's so much easier if we have it.\"\n\nThat will be a tall order. But as a general-election candidate, Trump will need to win over more than just Republicans. In his inimitable way, he pledged to bring together the rest of the nation as well.\n\n\"We're going to bring back our jobs, and we're going to save our jobs, and people are going to have great jobs again, and this country, which is very, very divided in so many different ways, is going to become one beautiful loving country, and we're going to love each other, we're going to cherish each other and take care of each other, and we're going to have great economic development and we're not going to let other countries take it away from us, because that's what's been happening for far too many years and we're not going to do it anymore,\" he said. (That's a single sentence, if you're keeping track at home.)\n\nTrump faces significant obstacles to achieving that unity, particular with blocs that are not white men. Seven in 10 women view him unfavorably. It's even worse with minorities. A recent Gallup poll found that 77 percent of Hispanics view Trump unfavorably. A Washington Post poll pegged that number at eight in 10, seven of them \"very unfavorable.\" An NBC News/Survey Monkey poll found an astonishing 86 percent of African Americans had a negative view of Trump.\n\nOne reason for those atrocious ratings is the way Trump speaks to and about minorities, which was on display during his victory speech Tuesday.\n\n\"We're going to have great relationships with the Hispanics,\" he said. \"The Hispanics have been so incredible to me. They want jobs. Everybody wants jobs. The African Americans want jobs. If you look at what's going on, they want jobs.\"\n\nPart of Trump's rhetorical power is his supercharged used of \"we,\" a method that persuades people across the country that they are part of a larger movement, and somehow share with Trump his aura of wealthy and luxury. (It's the same technique he's used to sell real estate for years.) In the midst of his spiel about all the ways \"we\" would make America great again, Trump tossed in this passage about minorities.\n\nHis phrasing is telling. First, it suggests that for Trump, blacks and Hispanics aren't part of \"we\"-\"they\" constitute separate groups. Perhaps that's an accidental, unthinking division, but subconscious racial division is no less dangerous. Second, it shows him assuming that minority concerns can be reduced to economics. That view is perhaps unsurprising for a man who has spent his career trying to accumulate wealth, but it is a two-dimensional view of black and Hispanic Americans.\n\nThe fact that his policies simply don't line up with what most African Americans want in a president is one reason his numbers with black voters are so bad. Another factor is a presidential campaign driven in large parts by divisive appeals to racism and bigotry against Hispanics, Muslims, and other groups. Trump also has a long history of racially charged incidents, from alleged tenant discrimination to his strident reaction to the Central Park Five .\n\nThe entertainer has long spoken about minority groups with the outdated formulation involving a definite article: \"I have a great relationship with the blacks. I've always had a great relationship with the blacks,\" he said in 2011, using language that undermined his claim. He's said similar things about \"the Hispanics.\"\n\nChanging the way Trump speaks about African Americans and Hispanics won't solve his problems with those groups, but if he wishes to unify the country, beginning to speak about them as though they are part of the American populace would be a good place to start."

      "text": "Do White College Students Believe Stereotypes About Minorities?\n\nResearchers found that they bought into the trope that Asian Americans are more competent, and blacks and Latinos need to \"work harder.\"\n\nAsian American students are \"cold but competent.\" Latinos and blacks \"need to work harder to move up.\"\n\nAt least, that's how some of their white peers at the country's elite colleges and universities see them, according to a new study by Baylor University researchers. The study uses data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Freshmen, a survey of 898 participants from 27 prestigious American universities in which respondents rated their opinions of Asian, black, and Latino Americans based on work ethic, intelligence, and perseverance.\n\nResearchers set out to determine whether stereotypes of these minority groups are commonly believed and found their suspicions confirmed.\n\n\"Now we have some concrete evidence that some white people tend to think that,\" said Jerry Park , an associate professor of sociology in Baylor's College of Arts & Sciences and lead researcher on the study.\n\nPark said in an email Wednesday that respondents were asked to rate each minority group independently, which led to more accurate results given that many people find it socially unacceptable to draw direct comparisons. Students who believed Asians are more competent are the same ones who think Latinos and blacks need to work harder.\n\n\"Recent theories suggest that Latinos are generally perceived in the same ways as African Americans when compared against Asian Americans,\" said Park. \"These white student respondents tended to rate Asian Americans more highly than Latinos on qualities that reflect competence. When we analyzed this perception with beliefs about Latino inequality, the same relationship found for beliefs about African American inequality appeared also: These respondents tend to agree that Latinos do not work hard enough to improve their life circumstances.\"\n\nWorth noting: While an overwhelming majority of respondents had only one or no Asian, black, or Latino friends, there was no definitive correlation between the students' friendship composition and their views toward specific racial minorities.\n\nIn reality, the perceived performance of some minority students might have less to do with personal effort and more to do with structural inequalities that go unchecked, Park said. \"Residential segregation and low-income jobs work together to reduce the taxes available for poor neighborhoods with children. This results in poor quality education for many minority students.\"\n\nOf all minority groups, Asians are the least segregated in schools, and Latinos in the West are the most segregated , said Patricia Gándara , co-director of the Civil Rights Project at UCLA.\n\n\"Yes, they do perform very differently, but it's class, not race, that drives this,\" she wrote in an email. \"And those stereotypes get reified, and even the students carry those stereotypes and many Latinos and African Americans are afraid to try to compete with them-and then you get stereotype threat. So it gets replicated over and over.\"\n\nPark pointed out that many \"immigrant Asian Americans are recruited because of their specialized education and skills that result in the kind of 'human capital' that promotes educational pursuits in children... The stereotype presumes that this achievement is a result of inherent intelligence and/or competence, when in reality it is due to selective migration of the very smart individuals and families from various countries in Asia.\"\n\nTo combat these stereotypes, Park said Americans would do well to first acknowledge that these ideas influence their thoughts and behavior and educate themselves on the history and contemporary realities of American minorities.\n\nDesegregating schools and providing poor kids with the same educational opportunities could also make a difference, Gándara said. \"Unfortunately we cannot easily make up for all the social and cultural capital in the homes of these kids, but we can do what is possible to provide similar counseling, support, and out-of-school opportunities to begin to even things up.\"\n\nThere's also work to be done at the higher-education level, suggested Loyola University Chicago Assistant Professor OiYan Poon , whose research focuses on racial inequalities in higher education and Asian American students.\n\n\"Increased interactions between students of diverse backgrounds is key to helping students think critically about existing stereotypes among college students who will soon become leaders in various social sectors,\" said Poon, attributing the \"cold but competent\" stereotype-also prevalent in the workforce-to limited cross-racial interactions.\n\nThe study was published in Social Psychology Quarterly and focused on the opinions of white students because, researchers wrote, \"arguably, many of these respondents come largely from environments of privilege and will likely have significant influence in many quarters of American society.\"\n\nThis post appears courtesy of the Education Writers Association ."

      "text": "This Fall, Minorities Will Outnumber White Students in U.S. Schools\n\nA new study shows the changing demographics in American education.\n\nWhile 62 percent of the total U.S. population was classified as non-Hispanic white in 2013, when public schools start this fall their racial landscape will reflect a different America.\n\nAccording to a new report by the National Center for Education (NCES), minorities-Hispanics, Asians, African American, Native Americans, and multiracial individuals-will account for 50.3 percent of public school students. To break this down by grade levels, minorities will make up 51 percent of pre-kindergarteners to 8th graders and 48 percent of 9th to 12th graders.\n\nThis change in enrollment comes amidst a growth in the percentage of U.S.-born Hispanics and Asians in the overall population. Between 2012 and 2013, the Hispanic population grew by 2.1 percent and the Asian population grew by 2.9 percent. And reflecting these numbers, public schools will see big hikes in Asian and Hispanic students between 2011 and 2022. Hispanic students will rise by 33 percent, Asian/Pacific Islanders by 20 percent, multiracial students by 44 percent, and African-Americans by 2 percent between 2011 and 2022. Meanwhile the percentage of Caucasians is projected to decrease by 6 percent and of American Indian/Alaska Natives to decrease by 5 percent.\n\nHispanics and Asians are also forecast to produce the biggest increase in high school graduates: Between 2009-10 and 2022-23, there will be an increase of 64 percent in Hispanic graduates and 23 percent in Asian/Pacific Islanders.\n\nHowever, this demographic change raises some concerns. Hispanic, black, and Native American students tend to academically fall behind their white and Asian counterparts. And Hispanic and black students tend to live and attend schools in areas of greater poverty than whites. Leaders in education need to tackle some key issues regarding academic and economic disparities between minorities and whites, not to mention racial division and resource availability."

      "text": "Militant Minorities\n\nAMERICA bestirs herself to cope with the 'menace of Bolshevism.' Congress is about to pass laws forbidding the display of red flags, and putting ultraradicals in their place-behind the bars. Our Vice-President and our exPresident declare that they are in favor of hanging dangerous malcontents. The Department of Justice deports alien agitators. When strikers become threatening, mayors and governors call in troops, and win national reputations. The loyal, law-abiding, members of the state hear all about them a brazen assertion of the philosophy of force; and they have their answer ready - force, compulsion, repression.\n\nIn this instance, probably, coercion will succeed. We shall work through the readjustments that follow this war without revolution. The bulk of the country is conservative; and economic opportunities are plentiful. Furthermore, compulsion will be tempered with conciliation. The more sensible heads will insist on the removal of grievances. After a time political prisoners will be freed. The ferociously severe sentences of our war-time courts-martial will be scaled down. Labor exchanges and reclamation projects will mitigate unemployment. And, finally, we shall have a campaign of optimism: a continuous and uncompromising insistence that this is the freest, the most democratic, wealthiest, and most comfortable nation on the globe. This programme will succeed - for the time being.\n\nWe shall be deluded, however, if we imagine the ultimate victory for orderly government so easily won. The United States, and, indeed, every democratic country, is in peril of misunderstanding the malady that has laid hold of it. There is something wrong with democratic government, and the disease must be comprehended before it can be cured. The most striking symptom in our time is the new militancy of minorities. Whether sectional or dispersed, minorities tend more and more to take up an irreconcilable attitude, and to appeal to violence rather than to persuasion. This is a new tendency, new, at least, to the democratic tradition of America and England, as maintained throughout the nineteenth century. Heretofore minorities - and every majority is first a minority - have worked to persuade the rest of the community of the worthiness of their causes. They have patiently persisted, year after year, and sometimes decade after decade, until they either have achieved their goal, or have weakened in conviction. But now minorities begin openly to discard all programmes of discussion. They are frankly intransigent. They place reliance on strikes, suspension of industry, public disorder, and armed revolt. They cultivate a definite philosophy of insurgency, a creed of rebellion. They have but one slogan, 'No compromise.'\n\nThis new intransigence has been most clearly illustrated, in recent months, by the operations of the extreme Left of the Socialists in Europe, by the Bolsheviki, and by the Spartacides. These groups prefer to pose as having the majority with them; but if the majority, even the overwhelming majority, takes sides against them, they are not daunted. They then seize power, if possible, with machine-guns. They raid election booths, destroy ballots, disperse constituent assemblies. They believe in the dictatorship of the proletariat, or of that portion of the proletariat which they can rally. They are done with argument; they frankly put the issue to the test of might. They act on the theory that revolution is justified when successful. They scoff at moral condemnation, for they hold all bourgeois idealism inferior to their own.\n\nSuch a programme is abhorrent to those who retain their faith in government by discussion, and in the rule of majorities. These policies will, for the present, make little progress in America, for Americans are passionate adherents of democracy. But ultimately the dictatorship of irreconcilablcs may not seem so foreign to our thinking. Events intellectual, as well as historical, have marched faster in Europe than on this side of the ocean. We shall conquer this evil only if first we understand it. And in understanding it we must, at the beginning, guard against two possible misapprehensions.\n\nFirst, we must not imagine that the philosophy of force has found favor only among working-class minorities. Trotzky, and Liebknecht's disciples, and the leaders of the I. W.W. have no monopoly of the tactics of violence. Every minority in our day tends to become truculent. The most ardent advocates of woman suffrage, in England before the war, and in the United States during and since the war, have carried on a campaign of violence and sabotage. Pitted as these women were against superior force, their defiance of law has necessarily been more spectacular than alarming. Ireland, again, furnishes a striking instance. Ulster, in 1914, armed and drilled to resist Home Rule. The South of Ireland, under the Sinn Fein, now rejects every compromise except independence, prepares to carry out its programme by economic and political obstruction, and is kept from rebellion only by lack of arms. All modern minorities, whatever their specific grievances, gravitate toward outand-out insurrection.\n\nThe second possible misconception is akin to the first. We must not imagine that this dangerous fondness for revolution is merely a kind of political indigestion that has followed the war. It cannot be explained simply as an importation from Moscow or Berlin. This spirit has been developing for several decades; and observers who saw below the surface noticed the drift. For example the Westminster Gazette remarked on July 30, 1913,-\n\n'If we were to ask what is the great difference between Parliament now and Parliament forty years ago, the difference which is at the root of all the socalled Parliamentary maladies of these times, it is that the minority seldom or never yields until all the forms of resistance have been exhausted. . . . It is now the practice of all minorities to say that they will concede nothing to the majority, and to threaten to carry on every controversy by violent and extra-constitutional means, when Parliament has decided against them.'\n\nDemocracy, whatever the devices it employs and whatever forms it takes, means essentially government by discussion. It is a gamble on the reasonableness of human nature. Under it, abuses are thought to yield, within a reasonable time, to reforms. When men and women lose faith in the progressiveness of society under democracy, they begin to lose faith in democracy itself. That is precisely what we are witnessing in our time - a crumbling, about the edges, of faith in democracy.\n\nOf course, every minority, feeling strongly over its particular programme, grows angry if it finds itself continually thwarted. After a time it becomes bellicose. The Irish, a generation ago, were content to urge Home Rule by constitutional means. Their representatives sat at Westminster, and they leagued themselves with what political allies they could find. But no matter what victories they won, in the electorate or in the legislature, they always found themselves balked, in the end. Gladstone's defeat by the Lords, in 1893, and similar incidents in the struggle for Home Rule, must not be forgotten when Sinn Fein proclaims that parliamentary reform is a farce.\n\nEarnest and exasperated men cannot be expected to look with patience on the indefinite postponement of their projects. Not much solace is to be wrung from the promise of reform in the next generation. Yet undoubtedly the heretics in democratic nations would brook a great deal of delay, if only they felt sure that, in the end, reason and justice would have a fair chance to prevail. That is precisely what they no longer believe. They feel that, whenever powerful interests oppose them, majority rule is likely to be abrogated. Democracy, as now practised, they maintain, carries no guaranty that, when the people have been fully and freely convinced, the will of the people will be done. Too many constitutional barriers of various sorts can be thrown up; too much legal cover can be found by those who want to stalk and kill a 'dangerous' proposal. The conviction of the majority can be misinterpreted by the legislature, slain by the courts, sidestepped by the executive; and there is no sure redress. And so political struggles appear to the doubters of democracy as grapples between minorities, with the advantage to the one that is concealed, intrenched, disillusioned.\n\nThese skeptics have a more serious charge to bring: they allege that to-day opinion itself is manipulated and manufactured. The government, the parties, the special interests keep going, through the newspapers and a thousand other channels, an open or secret propaganda. The electorate renders back to its masters the verdict that has been pumped down into it.\n\nHere is an indictment that must be met candidly. Undoubtedly some of the professed friends of democracy talk in an amazing fashion about the people. They appear to think it possible to 'sell' any idea to the people, so long as it is advertised enough. To color the news, to suppress part of the facts, to play on the emotions, seems entirely legitimate, so long as the cause is good. In wartime, when passion runs high, there are groups of men in every country who would prosecute the struggle indefinitely, against growing popular opposition, and who would push the warmachine up to, and over, the brink of revolution, asserting to the last moment that the public is overwhelmingly behind them. Indeed, the maintenance of morale at home has come to be a definite part of war technique. The censor does more than suppress information sought by the enemy: he does our thinking for us. Modern war, which enlists the energies of vast populations, has given us this psychical development: this cool and cynical manufacture of morale by the skillful admixture of fact and deception, patriotism and hysteria.\n\nWill this attitude carry over into peace? The control of opinion is not new; and, probably, tampering with public sentiment is one of the oldest tricks of statecraft. But the war has taught us much about the practice of propaganda, and now its possibilities are openly canvassed. The thinking of the democratic masses is under the sway of great newspapers, and of highly organized news-gathering agencies - the strategic bridgeheads in any assault on popular sentiment; and they are more easily dominated, than heretofore, through collusion or purchase.\n\nDo we not detect a note of cant in some of the latter-day appeals to the people? Certainly we have leaders among us whose minds can embrace this inconsistency: that they will lay claim to an overwhelming popular support, and at the same time denounce an invitation to submit their proposals to referendum as little short of treason. Possibly it is not only at the edges, where stand the disgruntled and often desperate minorities, that faith in democracy wanes. Do we find politicians in these days sportsmen, demanding only that their case be given a full hearing, an exhaustive discussion, and a fair vote? Or do we find numerous self-appointed saviors of the plain folk intent on ramming their remedies down the popular throat, without ever stopping to seek consent?\n\nThe solid soil of democratic faith is loosened, giving the seeds of Bolshevism an opportunity to take root. It is primarily this doubt at the heart of democracy, and not hunger, or exploitation, or inequality, that makes the doctrines of Lenin so dangerous. The liberal state may, by the exercise of intelligence, weather the storm; but there is a grave possibility that democracy will not outlast the twentieth century. Certainly the peril is not to be subdued by calling out the police reserves. It is not to be disarmed by softening, under threat of anarchy, the lot of the poor and the broken. It is not to be undermined by establishing in America a Prussian system of education which lauds every excellence in our institutions and glosses every defect. And, lastly, it is not to be dissolved by returning to some previous golden age of democracy that our fathers knew.\n\nWe are not called upon to restore, but to improve. Democracy has been upon the boards for a century, and it has disclosed faults both in structure and in practice. It has revealed many a gap between its professions and its procedure. We are called upon to close the gaps, to make first principles realities.\n\nFirst of all, we must recognize, in fact as well as in theory, that the electorate is the ultimate forum of decision. Much confusion and much hypocrisy have marked our talk on this score. No honest line of distinction can be drawn between representative government and pure democracy. The government is always, professedly, responsible to the people; it must be made so in actuality. This means, without question, an occasional resort to a plebiscitum. The initiative and the referendum are clumsy instruments with which to shape the ordinary law-making of a state or nation. But when a crisis looms, or great innovations are proposed, the people have every right to be consulted directly. The health of democracy remains sound only so long as it is guided by the will of freely convinced majorities.\n\nIn the second place, those ' bourgeois legislative institutions,' of which Lenin speaks with such vast disrespect, must be improved and strengthened. A better class of men should be recruited into our legislatures, by removing the residential restrictions on candidates, by paying better salaries, and by giving securer tenure of office. Most vital of all, minorities should be insured seats through proportional representation. A minority with a voice in the legislature is likely to remain political. Every minority that wants our institutions revised, every minority that wants capitalism modified, or overthrown, should have an opportunity to push its schemes, openly, honestly, in our state and national assemblies. A socialism which pounds the table and demands municipal markets, or the curbing of monopolies, or a tax on unearned increment, is not a dangerous socialism. It is a spur to progress.\n\nAnd in the third place, we must invigorate, throughout the nation, the processes of discussion. This means, of course, the removal of all gag laws. Every suppression of newspapers, every political prison sentence, is a spade digging the grave of democracy. But this endeavor means more than the enforcement of free speech and free assembly. It means active aid and encouragement to debating and deliberation. The small meeting and the small newspaper, in particular, need to be promoted. The technique of national debate has scarcely been touched; it needs an intensive cultivation.\n\nThe foregoing are the sort of liberal measures that will save democracy from paralysis. The reactionaries who preach coercion are as much its enemies as the insurgents who preach organized revolt. A policy of intimidation will be met with terrorism. To-day force breeds force; for the new revolutionary idealism sanctifies riot and destruction. We can take our choice. We can abandon the struggle to stupid conservatism and exasperated discontent, to the spirit of domination and the spirit of rebellion. They are even now preparing to fight the issue through. Or we can create, if we have the courage to act boldly, a genuine democracy, and restore the faith that sustained our fathers. It is one or the other; we have no time to palter."

But for the newest generation entering the workforce, as the article \" Horatio Alger, R.I.P. \" notes, hard work may not pay off.\n\nThe relatively good news is that many minorities - despite facing a host of barriers -  are still optimistic about their futures. A recent Next America article cites a Pew Research Center study on people's views on the nation's economy. About 78 percent of blacks and 67 percent of Hispanics say they remain optimistic, compared with 48 percent of whites.\n\nHere are a few articles to bear in mind, from the standpoint of a diversifying nation, when thinking about challenges to reaching  for the American dream.\n\nBlack, Latinos, Asians Losing Middle-Class Ground : Minority groups, college students and those with only a high school diploma have lost significant middle-class ground in the past decade.\n\nWhy Do Blacks Trail in Benchmarks Leading to Middle Class? : Only about a third of African-Americans are entering the middle class, compared with nearly 70 percent of whites.\n\nParents' Income Influences a Person's Chance of Achieving the American Dream : Children born to rich or poor parents tend to stay in those ranks as adults. Specifically, kids born in the bottom fifth quintile have a 40 percent chance of reaching the middle class by the time they are middle age, compared with 75 percent of those who start at the top fifth quintile.\n\nHispanic Business Owners \" ̃Leading the Charge' : One way Hispanics strive for their American Dream is by starting businesses. Nine of 10 Hispanics say they are optimistic about their companies, which often target service industries and most of which have no more than nine employees.\n\nNew American Immigrants Hold the Key to Economic Growth : In his opinion piece, Ali Noorani of the National Immigration Forum writes that \"one in every 10 private-business employees works for an immigrant-led company.\"\n\nHispanic Sector Finding Affluence in Owning Businesses : In the century's first decade, the number of Hispanic households whose annual income exceeds $100,000 rose from 556,000 to 1.56 million."

Each individual's average score affects their access to basic goods and services, like housing and transportation.\n\nIn real life, too, people are followed around by scores and ratings that can grant or deny opportunities-but instead of being determined by other people, they're assembled by mysterious algorithms. From credit scores to hiring processes, automated systems make decisions based on vast troves of personal information, often without revealing the kinds of information included in the calculus. Some even take into account people's friends, families, and acquaintances to make assumptions about their character traits-which some privacy experts worry could lead to discrimination.\n\nA German company called Kreditech, for instance, asks loan applicants to share information from their social-media networks, which they can comb for details about their friends. Being connected to someone who's already paid back a loan with the company is \"usually a good indicator,\" the company's chief financial officer told Financial Times .\n\nIn India and Russia, FICO-the company behind the popular FICO credit scores-is partnering with startups like Lenddo to capture information about users from their cellphones. Lenddo uses locations reported by applicants' phones to figure out whether they really live and work where they say they do, and then analyzes an applicant's network to figure out \"if they are in touch with other good borrowers-or with people with long histories of fooling lenders,\" Bloomberg reports .\n\nThe push to consider more types of information can help people who lack credit scores, or who might not have the usual indicators of creditworthiness, access loans and bank accounts that might otherwise be closed off to them.\n\nBut the more complex and opaque these powerful algorithms get, the more ways there are for people to be disqualified from job searches and loan applications-and the harder it is to know why. What's more, systems that take into account the actions of people's family and friends risk assigning guilt by association, denying opportunities to someone because of who they're connected to. They can decrease a person's chance for upward mobility, based solely on the social group they find themselves in.\n\nSomeone living in a low-income community, for example, is likely to have friends and family with similar income levels. It's more likely that someone in their extended network would have a poor repayment history than someone in the network of an upper-middle class white-collar worker-if a scoring algorithm took that fact into account, it might lock out the low-income person just based on his or her social environment.\n\nThe Equal Credit Opportunity Act doesn't allow creditors in the United States to discriminate based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age-but taking into account a person's network could allow creditors to end-run those requirements.\n\nA 2007 report from the Federal Reserve found that blacks and Hispanics had lower credit scores than whites and Asians, and that \"residing in low-income or predominantly minority census tracts\" is a predictor of low credit scores. Since people are likely to have friends and family that live nearby and are the same race, using social networks to rate their creditworthiness could reintroduce factors that creditors aren't allowed to consider.\n\nIn an essay published in 2014 by New America's Open Technology Institute, three privacy researchers-danah boyd, Karen Levy, and Alice Marwick-wrote about the potential for discrimination when algorithms examine people's social connections:\n\nThe notion of a protected class remains a fundamental legal concept, but as individuals increasingly face technologically mediated discrimination based on their positions within networks, it may be incomplete. In the most visible examples of networked discrimination, it is easy to see inequities along the lines of race and class because these are often proxies for networked position. As a result, we see outcomes that disproportionately affect already marginalized people.\n\nPreventing algorithmic discrimination is a challenge. It's not easy to hold companies to the laws that would protect consumers from unfair credit practices, says Danielle Citron, a law professor at the University of Maryland. \"We don't have hard and fast rules. It's the Wild West in some respects.\"\n\nThe agencies in charge of enforcing the relevant laws-the civil rights division of the Justice Department, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the Federal Trade Commission-have a mixed record of going after companies that violate them, Citron says. And once their reins are handed to President-elect Donald Trump, they may be even less interested in pursuing violators, preferring instead to \"let the free market deal with it,\" she anticipates.\n\nA look abroad shows how far companies-and even governments-are willing to take scoring. Far beyond the network-based scoring systems in Russia and India, China is now testing a system that would assign Chinese citizens a score that goes far beyond the credit scores we're used to. According to The Wall Street Journal , the system takes into account the usual financial factors, but mixes in \"social inputs\" like adherence to laws (including traffic violations and paying for public transportation), academic honesty, and volunteer activity. The system will likely also use online indicators like shopping patterns and interactions with others.\n\nThe score could end up determining whether people can access internet services, jobs, education, transportation, and various other goods and services-not unlike the universal ratings in Black Mirror.\n\nU.S. laws would bar such a sweeping government-run system from being put in place here. But private companies, which are subject to different regulations than the federal government, could push closer to such a reality-indeed, credit scores in their current form already affect people's lives in crucial ways. \"We're not as far off as we think,\" says Citron."

      "text": "Democratic Socialism Threatens Minorities\n\nNothing better protects victims of bigotry than a system where they can pursue their needs and wants outside the realm of popular control.\n\nLast week, the leftist magazine Jacobin published an article arguing that \"the spectacular rehabilitation of socialism as a legitimate position within American politics, particularly among young people , is one of the most significant developments for the socialist movement in decades.\" I maintain that those young people aren't being told the whole story.\n\nWhen I first responded last week, my focus was a passage the authors intended as an acknowledgement that what they call \"socialism from above\" is dangerous.\n\nThey wrote:\n\nSocialists don't just want to replace private ownership with state ownership. In the same way we don't believe that capitalists should be able to have disproportionate control over economic resources, we don't think unaccountable state officials and bureaucrats should have the power to control investment and production through ' socialism from above .' In some cases, like the former Soviet Union, the failings of such a system are nearly as deep as those of capitalism itself.\"\n\nI inveighed against the notion that the Soviet economic system, with its many epidemics of mass starvation and death, was less flawed than market capitalism. Upon reflection, the authors changed their article to better reflect their actual belief: that \"in some cases, like the former Soviet Union, the failings of such a system are as clear as those of capitalism.\"\n\nThe update included this passage:\n\nThe authors' intention was to point out the failure of authoritarian collectivism to meet the democratic standard of socialism, not to imply a preference for the Soviet Union. As the rest of the essay makes clear, the authors view democracy as essential to any socialism worthy of the name, and as democratic socialists we condemn all economic and social systems that disempower the vast majority of workers. We regret that our original formulation may have contributed to a misunderstanding of our position.\n\nWith that out of the way, I want to explore what the authors mean by \"democratic socialism\" and \"the social power of the people,\" especially given their claim, \"Only when the private decisions that have massive public implications are subjected to popular control will we have a democratic society .\"\n\nTo most Americans, \"democracy\" always sounds appealing. But many young people who say they're \"democratic socialists\" may fail to grasp all that minorities would lose if democracy were radically less constrained by the political and economic system under which we currently live. What ought to scare them is not social-welfare spending on the less fortunate. The original Jacobin piece is clear that, in the estimation of its authors, the left should not be content even if it achieves progressive goals such as universal access to health care, higher education, and housing.\n\n\"Even in Nordic countries, where high levels of state ownership are combined with political democracy and a high standard of living, socialism is a long ways off,\" the authors wrote. \"Making people's lives materially better isn't enough. Neither is it enough to install union representation for workers. These changes would be welcome, but socialism moves well beyond them.\" It is \"a time to be bold,\" they wrote.\n\nThey don't seek to reform market capitalism, but to eliminate it:\n\nIn capitalism, economic power appears separated from political power . The economic power derived from owning productive assets allows capitalists to get rich while keeping workers' wages as low as possible, decide what is produced without any democratic input from the rest of society, hide harmful aspects of their products, and foist the harmful costs of doing business (\"negative externalities\") onto the rest of us. Capitalists say all of this is justified because it's \"their property.\"\n\nHere is part of how they define real socialism:\n\nMaybe the authors are less dedicated to democratic control as a first-order good than they appear to be when drawing on the good connotations of democracy. Either way, let's play out the vision they described.\n\nInstead of individual capitalists deciding what to produce in their endlessly varied, constantly competing private businesses, \"without any democratic input from the rest of society,\" control over industry and decisions about what to produce would reside in state planning agencies. And imagine their decisions perfectly, if improbably, reflect the actual democratic will of workers, whether in the nation; or a state, like Ohio or Utah; or a metropolitan area, like Maricopa County or Oklahoma City.\n\nPopular control is finally realized! So: How popular is Islam? How many Muslim prayer rugs would the democratic majority of workers vote to produce? How many Korans? How many head scarves? How much halal meat would be slaughtered? What share of construction materials would a majority of workers apportion to new mosques?\n\nReaders respond: Would democratic socialism really threaten minorities?\n\nUnder capitalism, the mere existence of buyers reliably gives rise to suppliers. Relying instead on democratic decisions would pose a big risk for Muslims. And Sikhs. And Hindus. And Jews. And maybe even Catholics.\n\nRight now, under capitalism, vegetarians and vegans have more options every year. But there aren't very many of them. Five percent of Americans are vegetarians. Three percent are vegans. Would \"the workers\" find a societal need to produce vegan meat or milk substitutes? No one knows the answer.\n\nHow important would worker majorities consider hair products for African Americans? What if a majority of workers decided that only English-language commercial reading material should be printed in the United States? Would planning bodies decide for or against allocating materials for sex toys? Or binders for trans men? Or sexually explicit artwork?\n\nThe birth-control pill has \"massive public implications.\" And remember, \"Only when the private decisions that have massive public implications are subjected to popular control will we have a democratic society .\"\n\nIs Trump ending free birth control?\n\nSo, young leftists: Would you prefer a socialist society in which birth control is available if, and only if, a majority of workers exercising their democratic control assents? Or would you prefer a society in which private businesses can produce birth control, per their preference, in part because individuals possess economic rights as producers and consumers, the preferences of a majority of people around them be damned?\n\nIf contraception at every CVS and Walgreens sounds better than \"popular control,\" you may be a laissez-faire capitalist, or at least recognize why democratic socialism can be a nightmare for many sorts of people.\n\nAs the economist and philosopher Friedrich Hayek put it, \"Our freedom of choice in a competitive society rests on the fact that, if one person refuses to satisfy our wishes, we can turn to another.\" But, he added, \"if we face a monopolist we are at his absolute mercy.\" Socialists are attuned to the ways individuals are vulnerable in capitalism but blind to ways that it frees us from the preferences of the majority. Nearly all of us would hate abiding by the will of the majority on some matters.\n\nIn another Jacobin article, Democratic Socialism Is About Democracy , the author writes:\n\nDemocratic socialism, at its core, is about deepening democracy where it exists and introducing democracy where it is absent. In countries like the US, that means increasing the scope of popular control in the political arena and broadening it out to include the social and economic spheres.\n\nThink of how that \"broadening\" would sometimes work. If a majority elected a populist demagogue like Donald Trump-which very nearly happened in 2016 (when he lost the popular vote) and may well happen in 2020-he would preside over not only our government, but also over our social and economic realms. The effect would be to consolidate power, not to disperse it, as the author ahistorically expects.\n\nTrump, the popular vote, and strategy for a future campaign\n\nI say ahistorically because the author is not nearly the first socialist to tout the increased \"democracy\" his revolution would supposedly harken in. Here's Vladimir Lenin on the features of proletarian (not bourgeois) democracy:\n\nThe Soviet form of organisation automatically helps to unite all the working and exploited people around their vanguard, the proletariat. The old bourgeois apparatus-the bureaucracy, the privileges of wealth, of bourgeois education, of social connections, etc.-all this disappears under the Soviet form of organisation. Freedom of the press ceases to be hypocrisy, because the printing-plants and stocks of paper are taken away from the bourgeoisie. The same thing applies to the best buildings, the palaces, the mansions and manorhouses.\n\nSoviet power took thousands upon thousands of these best buildings from the exploiters at one stroke, and in this way made the right of assembly-without which democracy is a fraud-a million times more democratic for the people. Indirect elections to non-local Soviets make it easier to hold congresses of Soviets, they make the entire apparatus less costly, more flexible, more accessible to the workers and peasants at a time when life is seething and it is necessary to be able very quickly to recall one's local deputy or to delegate him to a general congress of Soviets.\n\nProletarian democracy is a million times more democratic than any bourgeois democracy; Soviet power is a million times more democratic than the most democratic bourgeois republic. To fail to see this one must either deliberately serve the bourgeoisie, or be politically as dead as a doornail, unable to see real life from behind the dusty pages of bourgeois books, be thoroughly imbued with bourgeois-democratic prejudices, and thereby objectively convert oneself into a lackey of the bourgeoisie.\n\nProletarian democracy turned out to be a million times less desirable because the theory of its architects did not manifest as they had expected. So many socialist experiments end in atrocities precisely because extreme consolidations of power are necessary to attempt them. What many revolutionaries at first celebrate as greater democracy ends badly for most.\n\nToday's democratic socialists earnestly want to avoid mass atrocities. They believe they can do so by substituting extreme democracy for top-down socialism. But that very extremity comes with its own unique problems, and their \"solution\" would still consolidate power that is now widely dispersed across different realms of society with different hierarchies. In the economic realm alone, their solution would consolidate power now dispersed across firms with powerful incentives to serve mass and niche markets via decentralized, uncoordinated decisions.\n\nAnother Jacobin passage aptly illustrates a characteristic disconnect between the theory of democratic socialists and how democracy actually works:\n\nWhen democracy is on the march, it lays in its path state despots and private autocrats . It rips decision-making power away from the corporate titan, wrests the billy club out of the beat cop's hands, divests the domineering husband of his authority.\n\nAfter years of watching Black Lives Matter protests and police killings on YouTube, roughly 57 percent of Americans today say that they have \"a great deal\" or \"quite a lot\" of confidence in law enforcement. A majority favor the death penalty. Democratic majorities fueled the \"tough on crime\" policies of the high-crime decades that produced mass incarceration. Left-leaning New York City repeatedly reelected a mayor who favored stop-and-frisk. Maricopa County repeatedly reelected Joe Arpaio.\n\nAmericans' deep racial divide on trusting the police\n\nNeither today's political reality nor the sweep of American or world history suggest that more democracy \"wrests the billy club out of the beat cop's hands.\" In the United States, antidemocratic protections in the Constitution and antidemocratic methods like lawsuits and consent decrees are vital tools that diminish the ability of law-enforcement officers to abuse people.\n\nSocialist faith in what more democracy would bring is so often a romantic fantasy-even though \"in no country has there yet been mobilized a conscious majority for socialism,\" as Joseph Schwartz and Jason Schulman note at Democratic Socialists of America. \"This is not to deny the significant popular support for social democratic and labor parties that favor a mixed economy and greater socioeconomic equality,\" they go on to explain. \"But even in Sweden there has yet to develop a conscious electoral majority for a cooperatively-run economy.\"\n\nThere is a strangeness in watching the demos in every country repeatedly reject what one believes to be just for decades, in favor of what one believes to be monstrously unjust, yet nevertheless believing that if the same demos is put under democratic socialism, it will render reliably just judgments about how an entire society should produce and consume.\n\nOf course it won't."

      "text": "The Truth Behind Indian American Exceptionalism\n\nMany of us are unaware of the special circumstances that eased our entry into American life-and of the bonds we share with other nonwhite groups.\n\nThis article was published online on December 19, 2020.\n\nI n 1978 , several years after leaving India and coming to Texas, my parents decided to move out of our middle-class neighborhood in southwest Houston. Our new home, a few miles away, was a custom-designed contemporary structure on a one-acre lot in the exclusive Piney Point Village, population 3,419, a community that vies for the title of \"richest city in Texas.\" We had a swimming pool and a three-car garage, where my dad, an immaculately tailored allergist, parked his silver Cadillac and my mom parked her ivory Mercedes. We had, quite clearly, arrived.\n\nLike countless other immigrants, my parents had come to the United States, in 1969, with little cash in hand. Within a few years, my devout Hindu mother, orphaned at an early age, had switched from a sari to tennis skirts and was competing at Houston's swankiest clubs. My father, who hadn't owned a pair of shoes until he was 10, was buying season tickets to the Houston Symphony, where he promptly fell asleep during every performance.\n\nOur world was filled with Indian doctors and engineers. We never stopped to ask why their entrance into American society had been so rapid. We simply accepted that their success was a combination of immigrant pluck and the right values: Indians were family-oriented, education-oriented, and work-oriented.\n\nThere was a term for our place in the country's racial order: model minority . The concept is generally traced to a 1966 article in The New York Times Magazine by the sociologist William Petersen, which focused on Japanese Americans; the basic idea was extended to other Asian Americans. Of course, the notion of \"model minorities\" comes with a flip side-\"problem minorities.\" The terminology took on life at a time of intense social unrest: race riots across the country, the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., the emergence of Richard Nixon's racially charged \"southern strategy.\" Many Americans were losing what faith they may have had in the possibility of racial equality.\n\nToday, it's easy to take for granted the measures of Indian American success: the ubiquity of the \"Dr. Patel\" stereotype; the kids who, year in and year out, dominate the Scripps National Spelling Bee; a vice president-elect, Kamala Harris, whose mother was Indian; and, most notably, the median annual household income , which is among the highest of any group. Nikki Haley, Donald Trump's former ambassador to the United Nations, whose parents arrived in the U.S. in the late '60s, summed up one prevailing view this way: \"Mostly we're just good at being Americans.\"\n\nRead: Kamala Harris and the 'other 1 percent'\n\nWhat is forgotten is that before Indian Americans became a model minority, we were regarded as a problem minority. Also forgotten is the extent to which the U.S. engineered the conditions that allowed certain nonwhite groups to thrive.\n\nThis is a reality to which Indian Americans themselves often seem blind. From the comfortable perspective of university towns and tech hubs and white-dominated suburbs, Indian Americans do not see what they have in common with other nonwhite Americans-as if life in a bubble were truly possible, and as if the idea of common interest with other groups were unseemly.\n\nIn the late 1800s and early 1900s, after the Exclusion Act halted most immigration from China, North American employers in need of laborers turned to India, among other places. As Erika Lee notes in her 2015 book, The Making of Asian America , leaflets blanketed the Punjabi countryside promising \"opportunities of fortune-making\"-typically a wage of $2 a day if a man was strong. As their numbers grew, Indian immigrants, primarily working as farm laborers or lumberjacks, came to be considered \"the least desirable of all races.\" Nativists warned of a \"tide of turbans.\" The immigrants were overwhelmingly men, and were legally prevented from bringing over a wife or children. Subject to anti-miscegenation laws, the unmarried frequently found spouses in the Hispanic or Black communities.\n\nIn 1920, a court in Oregon granted citizenship to a man named Bhagat Singh Thind, an Indian immigrant who had served in the U.S. Army during the First World War. A naturalization examiner objected, and the issue made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court . Citing immigration and naturalization law of the time, the Court in 1923 ruled that Thind was not white in \"the understanding of the common man\" and denied him citizenship. In 1924, the U.S. passed the draconian Johnson-Reed Act , the last of a series of laws that effectively closed the door to immigrants from Asian countries.\n\nVaishno Das Bagai, the son of a wealthy landowner in Peshawar, had arrived on Angel Island, in San Francisco Bay, in 1915 with his wife, their three sons, and $25,000 in gold. He became a naturalized citizen in 1921. But the revocation of his citizenship, in 1923, led to the liquidation of his property, including the store he owned. In 1928, despondent, he took his own life. \"I came to America thinking, dreaming, and hoping to make this land my home,\" he wrote in a farewell letter addressed to \"the world at large,\" which was published in the San Francisco Examiner . \"Now what am I?\"\n\nAttitudes began to change during the Second World War. The U.S. began-selectively-to scrub exclusionary laws in a bid to build wartime alliances in Asia and to counter propaganda by Germany and Japan, which took aim at America's grim racial history. Naturalization rights were extended to Chinese immigrants in 1943 and to immigrants from India and the Philippines in 1946. Japanese Americans were of course an exception-their loyalty questioned, they were rounded up during the war and interned in detention camps.\n\nThe nature of anti-Asian racism in the U.S. was always different from that of racism directed at Black Americans, which was much older than the nation. In sheer numerical terms, the Asian and Pacific Islander population was small-in 1940, it was one‐50th the size of the Black population. African Americans would fight for decades more to end legal segregation and secure voting rights, even as doors were thrown open for Asians.\n\nAs one nation after another shed its colonial overlord-the Philippines in 1946, India and Pakistan in 1947, Indonesia in 1949-the U.S. was in the delicate position of trying to expand its sphere of influence without perpetuating imperial optics. In her book Cold War Civil Rights: Race and the Image of American Democracy (2011), the legal historian Mary Dudziak framed the issue pointedly:\n\nThe career of Dalip Singh Saund can be understood against this backdrop. Saund, a Democrat from California, was the first Indian American elected to Congress . In 1956, he narrowly defeated the Republican candidate, Jacqueline Cochran Odlum, a pioneering pilot and the first woman to break the sound barrier. She found it hard to believe that she had lost to \"a Hindu,\" and never ran for office again. Saund was in fact Sikh. He had arrived in the U.S. in 1920, at the height of anti-Asian sentiment, and received a doctorate in mathematics, but had gone on to become a successful farmer (and a justice of the peace). Early on, he wore a turban, but at some point he stopped. The images we have of him in later years show a dashing man in dark suits. In one photo, he flashes a rakish smile while greeting then-Senator John F. Kennedy. He represented a new kind of mid-century American.\n\nSaund's election was a big enough deal that a CBS television crew shadowed him on his first day in office. The House Foreign Affairs Committee sent Saund on an international tour to Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, and the Philippines. Saund said he wished to \"present myself as a living example of American democracy in practice.\" He and the committee hoped to counter, as Saund put it, \"the Communist lie that racial prejudice against Asians is rampant in America.\"\n\nIn 1959, Saund sat for a TV interview at WCKT, in Miami. The host introduced him, breathlessly, as \"probably the most unforgettable character I have ever met. The son of parents in faraway India who could neither read nor write, Judge Saund sits now with dignity and works with skill in the Congress of the United States.\" The interviewer seemed to be saying, See how far you have come. See how far we have brought you . But Saund more than held his own.\n\nIn 1965, Congress made sweeping changes to U.S. immigration law. Part of the impetus was greater equity, but there was also pressure, in a Cold War context, from dozens of newly independent nations in Asia and Africa. The U.S. did away with the admittance formula that had heavily favored immigrants from Western Europe. The new legislation also prioritized family reunification and professional skills, and Asian immigrants ultimately leveraged both to their advantage. When the legislation was passed, no one anticipated how radically it would alter the country's demographics.\n\nNor did my parents understand the extent to which their own lives and fortunes would be transformed when they arrived in this country. They had fled a slow, lumbering economy, one derided by Western skeptics for its \"Hindu rate of growth.\" My father's decision to move to the U.S. with my mother was at once an act of economic necessity and a sign of his intense ambition. The image of his sobbing parents and younger siblings upon their departure for the airport has stayed with him to this day. \"It was like a death in the family,\" he recalled in his self-published memoir, My Mother Called Me Unni: A Doctor's Tale of Migration .\n\nThis scene played out in thousands of families as many of India's best and brightest left for the U.S. From 1966 to 1977, according to the historian Vijay Prashad, about 20,000 scientists immigrated from India to the United States, along with 40,000 engineers and 25,000 physicians. The majority spoke English and came from upper-caste communities (as my parents did). The composition of the diaspora was representative of only a narrow slice of India: people who had the social capital and intellectual means to succeed far from home, and who had the resources to make the journey in the first place.\n\nThe result was an intense form of social engineering, but one that went largely unacknowledged. Immigrants from India, armed with degrees, arrived after the height of the civil-rights movement, and benefited from a struggle that they had not participated in or even witnessed. They made their way not only to cities but to suburbs, and broadly speaking were accepted more easily than other nonwhite groups have been.\n\nI don't recall hearing the name Dalip Singh Saund until I was in my 30s, well after I'd left Houston. Nor had I heard of Vaishno Das Bagai or Bhagat Singh Thind. These names were absent from my childhood. It was as if the entire history that preceded my family's arrival, the messy parts, had been snipped off. The year 1965, when the Immigration and Nationality Act was amended, was our Year Zero.\n\nMy parents arrived in this country in the waning days of 1969. They first settled in Washington, D.C., then moved to Connecticut, and finally put down roots in Texas. In a recent text thread with my two sisters, they recalled the excitement of moving into the Piney Point home-the trees, the serenity. \"But I didn't perceive it at the time as moving up in the world,\" Kala wrote. Subconsciously, though, we understood the new rules. We began to demand brand-name clothes-Izod and Polo-something my mother told us, years later, that she regretted giving in to.\n\nIn his memoir, my father recounted what he saw as my mother's evolution, and her awkwardness.\n\nI called Mom and asked her what she had felt about her adjustments back then. \"That's all Dad's fancies, you know. I had to go along with it. To have peace. And I thought, These are the things you have to do .\" As kids, we had been proud of our mother the tennis star, the woman who taught herself to ride a bike in her 30s. I hadn't considered the strain placed upon her-by her kids, by her husband, by the world beyond our home-as she attempted to fit herself and her family into this new place.\n\nIn many ways, my sisters and I had an exalted childhood. We traveled abroad, to Paris, Lucerne, Venice, and Tokyo, with frequent visits to see our relatives in India. Even as a young brown man, I felt secure. My parents never had to give me \"the talk\" that many Black teenagers receive. At the same time, I knew better than to expose my family life, even something as simple as the food in our refrigerator, to the judgment of the white world. Some people in that world, I realized, thought we were going to hell, that our food stank, that our customs were freakish.\n\nRecently I looked up the current census data for Piney Point: The city is 85 percent white and 12 percent Asian. The Black population, however, stands at 0.6 percent-virtually nonexistent, as it has been for decades. The historian Uzma Quraishi, who has studied the residential patterns of middle-class Indian and Pakistani immigrants in the Houston area in the 1970s and '80s, found that they track almost identically with those of white residents who left the central urban area for more affluent neighborhoods on the outskirts, ostensibly so their kids could attend \"good schools\" but also to distance themselves from Black residents. She calls this process \"brown flight.\" Those of us with roots in the Indian subcontinent had it drilled into us from an early age that \"divide and rule\" had been the most potent tool of the colonial power. As immigrants, had we become complicit in this same strategy?\n\nDuring the pandemic this spring, my parents were stuck in Kerala and watched, bewildered, as America seemed to implode, and not just from disease and economic distress. Police killings of unarmed Black Americans inspired national outrage and protest; a backlash led by armed white counterprotesters was quick in coming. I communicated with them by email and WhatsApp. On one occasion, I asked Dad what had prompted him and Mom to move to Piney Point, back in the '70s. \"Perhaps,\" he ventured in reply, \"the American dream.\"\n\nThat \"perhaps\" reflected the fact that many years had passed and memories were foggy. But I think it also reflected something else: that the American narrative is not nearly as neat and linear in his mind as it had appeared when he arrived here, months after the U.S. had put a man on the moon. The American dream doesn't mean what it once did to a newcomer.\n\nRead: Trump is scaring Indian Americans into finding their political voice\n\nIn 2017, just a few weeks into the Trump presidency, Srinivas Kuchibhotla , an Indian-born engineer, was killed at a bar in a Kansas City suburb. The killer had shouted: \"Get out of my country.\" Not long after, I found myself on an email thread with my dad and a few of his good friends, or \"uncles,\" as we refer to them, all retired Indian American doctors around the age of 80. They understood that the position of Indian Americans was in many ways privileged, and that threats were sporadic. But they were worried. \"The more noise we make, these racists will be awakened, who may never have heard of Hindus and their customs,\" wrote one. \"Fighting them alone may get us under six feet.\" The only thing to do, he said, was lie low. Despite all their success, and nearly 50 years of living in the U.S., the uncles were reacting as if their Americanness remained tentative and conditional.\n\nLike most of their Indian-immigrant peers, the uncles came from historically advantaged communities. This had helped them emerge from India's ferocious academic system victorious, allowed them to leap across continents and flourish professionally, and enabled them to isolate themselves in America's best and whitest neighborhoods.\n\nIt did not, however, prepare them for a fight-or for the realization that they were not in this alone.\n\nThis article appears in the January/February 2021 print edition with the headline \"The Making of a Model Minority.\""

KMOV management said Cory Stark's use of the Jim Crow-era word while reporting on racial discrimination was a slip of the tongue but unacceptable. \"It was in an original script as 'homeowners of color' and was inadvertently changed and mistakenly read on air,\" General Manager JD Sosnoff said, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch . \"We regret the error and apologized to our viewers.\" Stark delivered an on-air apology: \"The word should have never come out of my mouth, and it does not reflect who I am or what First Alert 4 represents.\" Among those who blasted KMOV for the broadcast was the National Association of Black Journalists, which called the term \"outdated, offensive and racist\" and said it was concerned that no one in the newsroom caught the mistake. \"Given that St. Louis' population is 43% Black, and the city is no stranger to racial strife, we would hope KMOV would be more sensitive in how it covers the Black community,\" the association said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "Just as More Minorities Access Higher Education, Public Support Recedes\n\nEducation as a vehicle to middle-class success is baked into the American Dream, and since the postwar period, higher education has been the preferred on-ramp to a more secure life. Yet that ramp is breaking down even as universities and colleges embrace a new era of diversity. We are at a precipice.\n\nA recent report ( PDF ) by the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics found that by 2025, the majority of American high-school graduates will be students of color. By 2030, the majority of college students will be students of color.\n\nMany of these students will be from families in economic need and will attend public colleges and universities in hopes of ascending a road to better-paying jobs. Yet they will enter a public higher educational system that has witnessed deep cuts in state after state.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA report ( PDF ) by The State Higher Education Officers Association details the damage. Since the Great Recession of 2008, state funding for higher education is down 11.6 percent, with those cuts coming on top of others a decade earlier. In some states, the damage is nearly catastrophic. Arizona and Illinois have seen public support for state higher education lopped by more than 40 percent in just a decade; Alabama and Pennsylvania have cut support by more than 35 percent.\n\nAnd even those numbers only count some of the cuts. States, such as New York, have taken operating costs the state once directly covered (such as salary increases per union contracts and increases in energy) and shifted those costs onto their universities and colleges operating budget. So, while the funding might appear relatively stable, the share of costs colleges need to cover leads to a real cut. This leaves these colleges to do more and more with less and less as they aim to provide a quality education at a price that's affordable for all students.\n\nThe result is that as students of color are going to colleges and universities in historic numbers, we are seeing larger and larger cuts to those institutions they are most likely to attend. It's an ugly pattern that America has seen before.\n\nHistorians Ruth Needleman and the late Judith Stein have both detailed how the steel industry collapsed in the 1970s just as African-American workers finally began finding well-paying jobs in it. They were the last hired, and the first fired, as production moved overseas-seeing their American Dreams slip away just after they'd finally laid hands on it.\n\nWith education as with steel, policy is a choice. Declining investment in higher education isn't a natural act but a concrete recognition of our collective priorities.\n\nBut education doesn't have to follow steel. Investing in public colleges and universities is an investment in our collective future and that of the American Dream.\n\nI understand that state funding is complicated and that there is a real distaste for taxes and other priorities vying for funding. But, declining public support for higher education (and K-12 education, too) means students at economic risk bear a greater share of the cost of college through tuition and fee increases. It also means those students are paying more to attend institutions that have at the same time cut back on faculty, classes, and facilities. In short, they are paying more for less.\n\nMiddle-class students might be able to shoulder those additional costs and still find a bargain attending flagship institutions that are often more protected. Poor and working-class students, however, quickly hit a point where they are either priced out, unable to make educational progress, or pushed into lower-rung schools with weaker track records of student success. As the door to the more established schools close on them, these students too often leave the public system altogether and turn to less reputable and riskier for-profit ones, as sociologist Tressie McMillan Cottom pointed out in her recent book Lower Ed: The Troubling Rise of For-Profit Colleges in the New Economy .\n\nWhen we shift risk onto students' shoulders, it is the more vulnerable students who struggle the most with that weight. Over time, we all feel it, as the spending decisions politicians make on our behalf now diminish our collective future and dim our American Dream.\n\nRichard@richardgreenwald.net\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "GOP Attracting Minorities?\n\nSpecial Correspondent\n\nWhat with everything going on these days, it wouldn't surprise me to learn that Reince Priebus hasn't been foremost in your mind lately. Well, this is your opportunity to correct that error, because I deliver tidings that the Republican National Committee is holding its winter meeting right now, starting yesterday, in Charlotte. A-No.1 on Chairman Priebus's list, say advance reports , is figuring ways the GOP can attract more support among minorities. Well, they could. But they'd have to do things that would make them not the Republican Party anymore, and their base would never permit it.\n\nLet's start with African-Americans. Republicans, whatever they might say publicly, won't actually try to win more black votes. Why? Because the positions the party would have to embrace to win black votes are abhorrent to the GOP base. Which, you may have noticed, is kind of racist. Now, people like me-pundits of the respectable class-aren't supposed to talk that way. We're supposed to cooperate in the fiction that the Republican Party is the party of Lincoln and underneath it all yearns to reawaken the great Jack Kemp tradition.\n\nAll that is a bunch of rot, I'm afraid, and the rank and file's racism is just a plain fact. Ever read some of those Fox News website comment threads on race stories, like this rather fascinating thread when Whitney Houston died, or certain Obama articles? It's like reading Bull Connor's diary. No, this doesn't mean every conservative is a racist. But it does mean that if you find yourself at a table with five conservatives and try to break the ice with a watermelon joke, you're very likely to get somewhere between two and three laughs.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA party with that kind of base is not going to be changing positions on affirmative action anytime in the next, oh, millennium. No-I really can't predict a meeting of the minds here in any remotely foreseeable future. Remember, the conservative, Republican-appointed Supreme Court is (presumably) about to undo affirmative action and the Voting Rights Act. It'll be another decade fighting to win those back at least.\n\nThe GOP base doesn't appear to boil with the same depth of contempt for Latinos. To Republicans, Latinos are the people who at least, you know, mow people's lawns and such. But I think conservatives misunderstand Latinos. It's true that they are a quite heterogeneous admixture of people from a broad range of cultures and historical traditions. But to the extent that they can be lumped together, as we do for electoral-demographic purposes, we find that they are alas a pretty liberal outfit.\n\nConservatives always say, \"Latinos are conservative; they are our natural allies!\" It's not really true. Exit polls last year found Latinos supporting abortion rights in quite large numbers, and ditto same-sex marriage (to a lesser degree, but still a healthy majority). The conservative misunderstanding, of course, is in assuming that personal conservatism equates with political conservatism. Sometimes it does, but a lot of the time it does not.\n\nAnd here's another thing about Latinos, especially working-class and working-poor Latinos. Because of language and cultural barriers, they have tended to take advantage of fewer state benefits than others. They don't use the earned-income tax credit as much, for example. There seems to me reason to think that over time, as language barriers lessen, that will change. And of course we have health care coming down the pike, and all its subsidies to families up to 188 percent of the poverty line. In other words, conservatives, millions more Latinos are poised to become card-carrying members of the good old moocher class! You think the party that wanted to repeal health-care expansion is going to get the bulk of those votes?\n\nThe main mistake Republicans make is that they actually think symbolic moves will accomplish the job here. More black speakers at the convention, three Latinos in office instead of one. Most people are actually smart enough to figure out that symbolism with no substance behind it is kind of insulting.\n\nThe bottom line is about the base. The GOP base consists of white people who are terrified of losing their skin privilege in Barack Obama's America. Even if Priebus and a few other Republicans are sincere in their efforts, the minute they start to take steps that are anything but symbolic and that are aimed specifically at trying to win over blacks or Latinos, the base will howl to the moon. I suppose it's possible that two or three generations from now, which means 30 to 50 years, white Republicans who grew up in our multicultural era will have different attitudes. But even that is a fairly big question mark-there are always going to be vast sections of the country where the population will be 90 or more percent white.\n\nChanging all this can't be done with some buzzwords and slogans. It is going to be a deeply painful and contentious process for the GOP. I'd say it will be amusing for the rest of us, but it will inject enough poison into the body politic to make it not much fun for anyone.\n\nSpecial Correspondent\n\nmichael.tomasky@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

The news organization found that, on average, in 40 percent of all housing searches, minorities were not treated the same as white buyers. The investigation found that black potential buyers were discriminated against 49 percent of the time compared with 39 percent for Hispanic and 19 percent for Asian house hunters. Instead, agents accommodated white clients while imposting more stringent conditions on minorities. Newsday says it conducted 86 so-called matching tests in a zone from the New York City line to the Hamptons and from Long Island Sound to the South Shore. In 39 tests, they paired black and white testers, in 31, they paired Hispanic and white testers, and in 16 tests, they paired Asian and white testers to reach their results.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "America Isn't Falling Apart. It's Still the Land of Opportunity.\n\nMore than 840,000 green card holders became citizens last year, the most in a decade. Over 10 percent of the American electorate was born elsewhere, the highest share in a half-century. All of Donald Trump's huffing and puffing could not stop this demographic evolution; nor could an endless stream of stories about what an unequal, unfair, and no good place America has supposedly become.\n\nThe ground-level integration of America-what my friend Sergio Munoz calls \"the multiculturalism of the streets\"-continues with ever greater mingling, epitomized by the rise and acceptance of interracial dating , up 40 percent since 2003, and marriage .\n\nWhat Trump and his most dedicated opponents have both had trouble appreciating is that, rather than a chaotic future defined by racial conflict, most Americans want both order and justice. Most Americans initially supported the George Floyd protests but soon overwhelmingly rejected the violence and looting that accompanied them. Racial minorities, like other Americans, are increasingly heterodox in their political views.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis was evident in Trump-an unpleasant and unprincipled man frequently labeled as a \"racist\" in the mainstream media , a term also applied to his voters - improving in 2020 on his 2016 results with most minorities, including a significant gain in the Latino vote , particularly in Florida and Texas , and among Black men. In California, Asian voters also didn't flock to Trump, but they helped reject an affirmative action measure bankrolled by the tech oligarchs. In heavily Asian Orange County, Biden won comfortably but the affirmative action measure lost 2-to-1, and two Korean American women replaced Democratic congresspeople. The measure was also crushed in heavily Latino interior counties,.\n\nAnother issue where elite support and popular opinion diverge is defunding the police, a position that the vast majority of Americans-including millennials and minorities -do not favor. As my colleague Charles Blain points out, when the Houston city council was swamped with testimony from residents pushing for the dismantling of the city's Police Department, Black council members and Mayor Sylvester Turner pushed back, saying that these people clearly didn't spend time in the communities that they claimed to support. A similar dynamic played out in New York, where Black City Council members held the line against a push to slash the NYPD budget by $1 billion.\n\nEconomics account for some of Trump's gains among minority voters. Before the pandemic, most minority workers had done better in terms of income under his administration than they had under previous administrations from both parties. Like working-class people in general, most African Americans did worse economically under Barack Obama despite the enormous boost in political power and influence for portions of the African American upper class on his watch.\n\nLatinos, suggests former California state Senate Majority Leader Gloria Romero . have been devastated by the state's more extreme lockdowns , and angered to see their putative advocates, like Gavin Newsom or Nancy Pelosi, flaunt their privilege in luxury and even violate their own rules as \"ordinary people have literally been arrested and even thrown in jail for opening their businesses to just survive and feed their families.\"\n\nAt the same time, the \"woke\" views adopted increasingly by corporate America and the mainstream media often do not play well with many immigrants, who, according to one recent survey , are twice as conservative in their social views as the general public. That dynamic may also explain Trump's gains among culturally conservative Muslim voters and orthodox Jewish voters .\n\nThe growing heterodoxy among minorities can also be seen in their growing geographic dispersion. The notion of minorities clustered in true blue urban enclaves is increasingly antiquated. According to statistics compiled by demographer Wendell Cox in a newly released report , minority populations are growing most rapidly in the South, the Intermountain West and parts of the Great Plains.\n\nFor example, the fastest growth among Black households since 2000 has been in Phoenix; Salt Lake City; Boise, Idaho; Fayetteville, Arkansas; and Las Vegas. Meanwhile the Black population has stagnated in Chicago, New York, and San Jose, and actually declined in the Los Angeles and San Francisco metros. Where 1 in 7 San Franciscans was Black in 1970, today it's barely 1 in 20.\n\nSimilarly Hispanic growth has been most notable in the South, with growth of over 200 percent in Knoxville and Nashville, Tennessee, and Charlotte, North Carolina, while slowing to roughly one-tenth that pace over the past two decades in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, and San Jose. Similar patterns can be seen among Asians, where cities such as Indianapolis, Fayetteville, Charlotte, Raleigh, and Las Vegas have seen increases over the past two decades of 200 percent or more-four times the rate of Los Angeles, which has the nation's largest Asian community.\n\nAccording to Cox, the demographer, foreign-born populations follow a similar pattern: stagnating and even declining in places like Los Angeles, New York, and Chicago while expanding rapidly in places like Atlanta, Orlando, Charlotte, Kansas City, Nashville, and Louisville. In these areas immigrants generally live with other groups; there are ethnic malls, but not large one-race enclaves.\n\nThe suburbs, not the city, now dominates the non-white experience in America. The model of 1950s and 1960s \"white flight\" no longer holds. In the 50 largest US metropolitan areas, 44 percent of residents live in racially and ethnically diverse suburbs , ranging from 20 percent to 60 percent non-white. In Atlanta, for example, more than 70 percent of Blacks and Hispanics live in the outer suburbs . Nationwide, in the 53 metropolitan areas with more than a million residents, more than three-quarters of Blacks and Hispanics now live in suburban or exurban areas.\n\nMost minorities still seek out \"the American dream\", notes a recent AEI study , but many lack the conviction they can achieve it.\n\nOne way to achieve the dream is to move-property remains key to financial security. Homes today account for roughly two-thirds of the wealth of middle-income Americans. Home owners have a median net worth more than 40 times that of renters, according to the Census Bureau . Yet in some parts of the country, notably California and the Northeast, housing prices are often out of reach for most minorities.\n\nIn many southern metropolitan areas, like Atlanta, Black home-ownership exceeds 50 percent compared to one-third in Los Angeles, Boston, or New York. Among large metros, Atlanta and Oklahoma City rank highest in best housing affordability for African Americans; for Hispanics, Pittsburgh, Akron and St. Louis stand out while the least affordable housing markets include the four large California metros, Honolulu, and Boston. Asians also follow this pattern, with better affordability in the South and Midwest, while ownership is much lower in traditional Asian hubs as New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Honolulu.\n\nMinorities are leaving our biggest, densest cities not because they do not love the cultural amenities of New York or California, but for basic economic opportunity created, in part, by underserved markets, lower taxes, lower costs, fewer regulations on new businesses.\n\nThis follows an old American tradition. Economically driven migration in the late 19th century and early 20th century saw Scottish, Scandinavian, and German migrants head to the Great Plains, Armenians to California's Central Valley, and Mexicans early in the last century to the Southeast and the cities of the North.\n\nToday immigrants are transforming and re-energizing the Heartland and the South in surprising ways. Nashville may be the country music capital but it is also home to a Little Kurdistan , a Somali community and a growing Latino presence . When I went with my younger daughter to Fargo last summer, we stumbled, in our surprise, on a Thai ice cream parlor. In places like Grand Island, Nebraska , you can run into streets filled with Honduran eateries, servicing the largely Latino workforce that works in the meat packing plants.\n\nRepublicans may fret about the political effect of these diverse populations,  who may lean Democratic but the newcomers also are making these places both more economically vibrant and attractive to skilled workers, as demonstrated in a recent report from Heartland Forward . It is also likely that minorities living in more conservative places, starting businesses and buying homes, may be less predictably lockstep in their politics; in Texas, where Latinos generally do better and are more able to buy homes than in California or New York, they also tend to split their votes more evenly between the parties .\n\nIt is in these new places of opportunity-suburbs, small cities, Sunbelt boom towns-that America's racial quandary can be settled, quietly and with less rancor. \"The multiculturalism of the streets\" where newcomers meet, eat, work, and even marry with the majority population, is where the burden of our historical racial legacy is being overcome, if only people would bother to see it.\n\njoel@joelkotkin.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "New York Just Saved a Law Used to Jail Thousands of Minorities\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo late Monday night killed a bill to reform the state's controversial \"gravity knife\" law, which has been used to jail thousands of working people of color.\n\nCuomo used his veto message to cite \"continued concerns of law enforcement\" in quashing a measure that had the support of virtually every criminal-justice reform organization in the state. It's a move that's bound to draw criticism for a Democrat who often cites equitable justice policies as among his biggest priorities and may have presidential ambitions.\n\nThe bill's  failure represents something of a victory for another New York politician, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, who has not seen many of those lately. Vance has been pilloried for passing up giftwrapped prosecutions of Harvey Weinstein and the Trump children . Vance has  lobbied aggressively for years against reforms that have been percolating since 2014.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe \"gravity knife\" law was first passed in 1958, and targeted at a large, menacing variety of knife similar to a switchblade. While true gravity knives are nearly extinct on the modern market, in recent years the law has been interpreted by New York City authorities to ban a wide range of common folding knives. Any knife that can be opened with a practiced flick of the wrist, which includes virtually every widely available pocketknife, can be shoehorned into the legal definition, even if it was never designed to operate that way. In most cases, the charge is a misdemeanor, but defendants with a prior conviction can draw a felony charge and up to seven years in prison.\n\nTake the case of Richard Gonzalez, a laborer Vance prosecuted in 2011 for the Husky utility knife he bought at Home Depot. The tool he had in his possession is exceedingly common, and generally used to cut drywall. Its exposed blade is about an inch long. When he was contacted by police in a subway station, Gonzalez wasn't accused of using the knife to harm anyone, or even threatening to do so. But when an officer spotted it in his pocket, and found that it could be snapped open with a flick, he was arrested. Vance prosecuted Gonzalez' case aggressively, and he ultimately served four years in state prison.\n\nVance has long argued that knives that open quickly pose a special danger. In a letter responding to a New York Times editorial last summer, Vance pointed to an uptick in knife crimes to suggest that the reforms were ill timed.\n\n\"The ban has enhanced public safety, and ending it now amid highly publicized slashing incidents in our city's streets and subways is not advisable,\" Vance wrote.\n\nLike many misdemeanor charges, gravity knife cases in Manhattan are often dismissed with a kind of probation agreement, and Vance says he doesn't prosecute workers who possess knives for legitimate purposes.\n\nBut there is no evidence that gravity knives, as a class, are especially prone to use in crime. And oddly enough, the law is almost never enforced outside of New York City. In contrast, as many as 70,000 people in the five boroughs have been arrested under the statute in the past 10 years, according to statistics compiled by the Legal Aid Society.\n\nAbout 84 percent of defendants were people of color, and a disproportionate number of them were prosecuted in Vance's jurisdiction. One study found that Vance's office had prosecuted about four times as many felony gravity knife cases as the rest of the city's DAs combined.\n\nPublic defenders complain that the law is little more than an easy way for officers to pad their arrest numbers in a quota-driven system. Maybe most maddening for lawyers who defend these cases is that such knives are still sold openly at retailers all over the city. The Legal Aid Society last year found more than 100 stores selling them in Manhattan alone. One hardware store on Gold Street in Lower Manhattan, a few blocks from Vance's own office, has such knives in their front window.\n\nWhile Vance has prosecuted scores of contractors, construction workers and other working people for their tools, he has not levied criminal charges against a single retailer for selling those same knives.\n\nVance had an opportunity to do so in 2010 , only months after he took office, when he sent investigators to surveil retailers like Home Depot, Ace Hardware and Eastern Mountain Sports. At all of them, he found knives that routinely draw felony charges in his jurisdiction.\n\nBut rather than take those companies to court, he offered them something else entirely: a deferred prosecution agreement. After a splashy press conference, seven businesses were required to submit to monitoring by Vance's agent over a period of two years, and to remit some sales proceeds, about $1.9 million collectively. In exchange, Vance promised not to file criminal charges. It was considerably more lenient treatment than Vance offered Gonzalez and legions of others.\n\nBut if that disparity wasn't stark enough, five of those retailers also went on to violate their agreements in various ways, according to an internal report released under New York's Freedom of Information Law. Even when some continued selling knives they had agreed to cease carrying, they suffered no consequences.\n\nAs late as 11:30 last night, a compromise on the reforms seemed likely, according to multiple parties involved on both sides of the negotiations. An alteration of the bill as passed would have stopped short of full legalization, instead downgrading possession of a gravity knife to a noncriminal offense.\n\nThat would have been a far from perfect solution for reformers - it would have still allowed arrest at an officer's discretion - but it would, crucially, have eliminated the felony provisions and the many knock-on effects of a misdemeanor charge, like sometimes dire immigration consequences. Opposition from Vance seems to have been a factor yet again, as were machinations by the Republican senate leadership.\n\nThe legislative reform effort's main driver, Manhattan Assemblymember Dan Quart, released a caustic statement calling the failure a \"dark mark on our legislative process,\" and pointing to the bipartisan coalition that had brought the bill through the legislature with nearly unanimous support.\n\n\"Communities of color will have no relief from the Manhattan District Attorney's pattern of prosecuting poor people for possessing this simple work tool,\" in the wake of Cuomo's decision, Quart said. \"Make no mistake, this veto will have real life consequences for New York families.\"\n\n2joncampbell@gmail.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "How Trump Helps the GOP With Minorities\n\nWhile countless Republicans are lamenting how Donald Trump is destroying their party, it's possible he just may end up saving it. Because in the last few weeks, The Donald has finally managed to do something no other Republican-or Democrat-has. He's forced the Republican Party to acknowledge and confront the wide swath of bigotry and intolerance plaguing the party . When the dust clears Donald Trump will likely cost Republicans the White House in 2016. But he may just clear the path for a new beginning between Republicans and minority voters for future elections.\n\nThere have been numerous troubling incidents in which black anti-Trump protesters have been verbally harassed and physically assaulted at Trump events.\n\nNot to mention other racially charged moments involving his supporters, such as one recently photographed offering a Nazi salute (which she later claimed was not because she holds Nazi beliefs.) And then there was the violence that shut down a Trump event in Chicago. As the outlandish behavior has escalated, more and more Republicans are feeling compelled to denounce it. But for many of us the question is, what took your party so long?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThough Republicans like to trumpet the moniker \"the Party of Lincoln\" (i.e. \"We're the party that freed slaves\"), it hasn't been that in a long time. Despite the best efforts of some modern-day Republicans to rewrite history, the truth is the suspicions many minorities hold toward Republicans come from a legitimate place. As outlined by John Nichols in his piece \"When Republicans Really Were the Party of Lincoln,\" the Civil Rights era was a key turning point in the relationship between Republicans and black voters.\n\nSouthern Democrats like Strom Thurmond abandoned the Democratic Party because of President Johnson's civil right efforts (despite Thurmond having fathered a black child himself), while Republicans who supported such efforts were displaced by a new brand of Republican; Republicans like Richard Nixon and others who would rely on a so-called Southern strategy that preyed on the resentments of angry white voters and convinced them that their problems could be blamed on a changing America that was benefitting brown voters at their expense.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nThough former Republican National Committee Chair Ken Mehlman formally apologized to the NAACP for relying on the Southern strategy in previous elections , for many black voters the image of the Grand Old Party as Grand Old Racists has been hard to shake. That has only grown truer since President Obama took office. While there are plenty of conservatives who simply don't agree with the President's policies, there are others whose contempt for him has been tinged with racial undertones-and in some cases blatant overtones.\n\nThere was Southern Republican Congressman Geoff Davis (yes, ironically he sort of shares a name with the President of the Confederacy) who referred to the President as \"boy,\" a term of denigration historically favored among white Southerners to remind black men that they were not in fact men in their eyes. There was the Republican mayor who shared watermelon jokes about the White House following the President's election. The list goes on. (Literally- here is a list just from the President's first year in office.)\n\nBut through it all, a common narrative prevailed among the Republican establishment that they continued to relay to black Americans-and all voters of color. \"We're welcoming. We're inclusive. Just like any family we have a few bigots, but they are few and far between.\"\n\nThanks to Donald Trump, however, now they know and we know that the bigots are not few and far between, but in fact comprise a significant portion of the Republican electorate. David Duke's endorsement, The Donald's struggle to denounce it and his supporters' ambivalence about it all, combined with recent racially charged violence, have proved just how terrifyingly bigoted some of them really are. That's depressing but for some of us minorities it also represents a cause for celebration. Here's why.\n\nThere's a saying: \"Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not after you.\" For a long time minority voters who expressed suspicion that racism was prevalent within the GOP were dismissed as paranoid intellectual hostages of Democratic propagandists.\n\nNot anymore.\n\nThe word racist has been debated, dissected and thrown around so much in the Obama era that it's almost become meaningless. But at the very least there's one thing decent Americans of all races and parties seem to agree on, which is that the Ku Klux Klan is racist, and a political candidate who can't be bothered to run from a Klan-affiliated endorsement as quickly and as far as possible is not someone any party should want as a representative.\n\nThe passionate denunciations by Republican leaders Mitt Romney and Nikki Haley and House Speaker Paul Ryan, and recently others ,  of Trump's extremist rhetoric and extremist supporters marks a turning point. The GOP has finally stopped being in denial that racism and racists are alive, well and active in the Republican Party and in big enough numbers to sway a presidential election.\n\nMany black Americans knew this. It took Donald Trump, and his supporters, including David Duke, to give establishment Republicans a wake-up call. Now the real test begins. What will the Republican Party do next?\n\nIn their desperation to win, will the Republican National Committee go all in and begin another era of the Southern strategy by exploiting the worst fears of Donald Trump's base to win in 2016? Or do they have the courage to take the high road and do the right thing by reaching out to voters of color and saying, \"I'm willing to lose one election to convince you that we are a party worth giving a fair shot to in every election after 2016\"?\n\nMy selfish hope is that they will do the latter. Because while conducting polling in 2007 for my book Party Crashing , I discovered that unlike our parents, black voters under 40 made up one of the fastest-growing groups of registered independents in the country, something that left me hopeful. Because I've dreamed of seeing a presidential election in which both major parties fight for my vote as hard as they fight for the votes of soccer moms, NASCAR dads or whoever the trendy swing voter du jour that election cycle happens to be.\n\nBut that won't happen until the Republican Party purges itself of those within who are still holding up a figurative \"Whites Only\" sign.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "When Tyrants Banned Religious Minorities\n\nIn the wake of the Trump administration's changes to immigration regulations, many people are wondering if this is the beginning of religious censorship in the United States. Certainly it wouldn't be the first time a government implemented a ban on members of a religious group it viewed dangerous or subversive. But religious bans never work out for anyone: either those being targeted or the governments sending others into exile.\n\nRoman Emperor Vespasian Expels the Stoics\n\nWhen we think about religion we often mean ethics and how a person choose to live his or her life. In the Greco-Roman world the task of debating what it means to live a good life fell not to priests but to philosophers. Much like today's modern press, ancient Stoic philosophers saw themselves as responsible for exercising \"bold speech,\" that is, reprimanding their leaders and speaking truth to power.  This situation had the potential to make philosophers very unpopular with governmental officials.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn the first century CE the emperor Vespasian expelled virtually all of the Stoic philosophers from Rome. According to the historian Cassius Dio, when one philosopher, Demetrius, decided to resist, Vespasian told him, \"You are doing everything to force me to kill you, but I do not slay a barking dog.\" Helvidius Priscus, an anti-imperial philosopher who spoke out in favor of returning Rome to a republic, was executed.  These events were just one moment in a tense relationship between Roman philosophers and Roman emperors that lasted for much of the second half of the first century.\n\nDiocletian persecutes the Christians\n\nFor the vast majority of the first three centuries of the Common Era, Christians lived in relative safety. Christians could be executed for sedition, treason, or any of the many other crimes that warranted the death penalty, but save for a few months under the emperor Valerian they were not the targets of official legislation.\n\nAs I wrote in my book Myth of Persecution, this changed between 303-305 when the emperor Diocletian attempted to unify the empire through a series of edicts designed to elicit displays of patriotism and loyalty. The publication of the first edict made the holding of Christian meetings illegal and ordered the destruction of Christian places of worship and the confiscation of Christian scriptures. Christians were denied the right either to petition the courts or to respond to legal actions brought against them, making them especially vulnerable in judicial contexts. Christians with distinguished social status lost their rank and imperial freedmen were enslaved. Everyone, including Christians, was now expected to sacrifice before engaging in any legal or official business.\n\nA second edict was published in the summer of 303, ordering the arrest of Christian clergy. The third edict in November 303 provided an amnesty for imprisoned clergy providing that they participated in a loyalty test to the emperor. The fourth and final edict, issued in the spring of 304, required that everyone - men, women, and children - gather in a public space to offer sacrifice. If they refused they were to be executed. The edicts certainly produced martyrs but it drove many more Christians into hiding and exile.\n\nKing Philip Expels the \"Moriscos\"\n\nIn 1609 King Philip III of Spain ordered the expulsion of a group known, somewhat perjoratively, as the \"moriscos\" or \"little-moors.\" The moriscos were the descendants of Spain's historic Muslim population, which had arrived on the Iberian peninsula with the Umayyad conquest in 711. Some nine hundred years later roughly one million \"moriscos\" lived in Spain, having been forcibly converted to Christianity by Spain's Archibishop Cisneros in the fifteenth century.\n\nDespite their conversion, popular prejudice continued to be suspicious of the \"moriscos\" and held that they engaged in secretive Islamic rituals. The result was that between 1609 and 1616 as many as 300,000 people were exiled from Spain. Most of them settled in Morocco and on the fringes of the Ottoman empire.\n\nEthics aside, the expulsion of the moriscos, as the Daily Beast has reported before , was extremely counter-productive for the Spanish and actually devastated the economy of the Kingdom of Valencia. More importantly it shows how tightly interwoven religious and racial prejudice can be.\n\nEngland exiles Jews\n\nThere is no shortage of governments that have persecuted the Jews. Religious and political authorities alike have focused negative attention on Jews as a means of galvanizing popular support, creating scapegoats, and deflecting attention from themselves. In 1290 King Edward I issued the Edict of Expulsion and exiled around 2000 Jews from England. His actions were in part motivated by a financial crisis within the royal household.  When Edward first expelled the Jews from Gascony and England he appropriated their property and debts. He then passed on the cost of deportation to the English taxpayers who, fired up by anti-Semitic myths and folklore, were happy to foot the bill of exiling scapegoated English Jews.\n\nIn their article \"States, Regimes, and Decisions,\" Karen Barkey (now the Haas Distinguished Chair of religious diversity at UC Berkeley) and Ira Katznelson (Ruggles Professor of political science and history at Columbia) argue that the expulsion was not just about money; it was about state building. They argue that the motivation behind the expulsion of Jews from England and France was the \"result of attempts by kings to manage royal insecurity, refashion relations between state and society, and build more durable systems of taxation within the territories they claimed as theirs.\" All of which means that as European social identities began to fossilize and Jews became less financially important, Jews also became more clearly identifiable as outsiders. This left them socially and politically vulnerable and ultimately led to their eviction.\n\nJapan bans the \"Foreigners\"\n\nIn the seventeenth century, and following decades of trade with Europe, Tokugawa Iemitsu, the shogun of Japan, decided to expel foreigners from the country.  Issued in 1635, the Sakoku edict banned foreigners already in Japan; it also\n\n\"threatened any foreigners who tried to enter the country illegally or anyone who practiced Christianity with the death penalty.\" The purpose of the ban was not just to limit \"foreign\" incursions into Japan but also to protect Japan from evangelization by Catholic missionaries in particular. As with Diocletian, there was a religious loyalty test ( fumi-e ) that people had to pass in order to prove that they were not Christians: they had to step on a picture of Jesus. Those who refused to renounce Christianity were often tortured and killed.\n\nThe ban on foreigners lasted for two hundred years before an American Commodore, Matthew Perry, sailed a four-ship squadron into Edo Bay (Tokyo Bay) in July 1853. Perry provided Japanese officials with two white flags and told them to hoist the flags when they wanted him to stop firing his cannons at their buildings. The incident marks the beginning of the end of the isolationist policy.\n\nLooking back over the course of the past two thousand years, it is remarkable how many of these violent and discriminatory measures were about profit and patriotism. As Dr. Heidi Wendt of Wright State University told The Daily Beast , \"the evidence would suggest that these incidents were not typically, if ever, a straightforward matter of religious or intellectual intolerance.\" Wendt added, \"What is more certain is that [religious bans] often had the paradoxical effect of drawing attention to and legitimating the very practices or figures targeted [by this legislation], with the result that the latter's influence only expanded.\"\n\nThe specters of foreign dangers and internal sedition hung over all of these governments, but the sense that national unity could be secured only by eliminating religious difference, and national interest by excluding foreigners, are persistent themes. To this day a number of countries enforce legislation that selectively targets members of specific religious groups: since 2016, to take one example at random, Putin's Russia has forbidden evangelization outside of churches.\n\ncandidarmoss@gmail.com\n\nGot a tip?

White Americans now have on average 20 times the net worth of African Americans and 18 times that of Latinos. According to the Pew Research Center, the gaps were compounded during the housing bust and the subsequent recession, and essentially wiped out much of the economic progress made by people of color over the past 20 years.

According to the Pew Research Center, the economic crisis has essentially wiped out much of the economic progress made by people of color over the past 20 years, resulting in \"lopsided wealth ratios\" that \"are the largest since the government began publishing such data a quarter-century ago.\"\n\nHousehold wealth is the sum total of one's assets, such as your house, car, savings and stocks, minus the sum of your debt, such as the mortgage on your house, your car loans or credit card debt. It is different from household income, which measures your annual wages and other earned income.\n\nWealth gaps between whites, African Americans and Hispanics have always been much greater than income gaps. But Paul Taylor of the Pew Research Center explains that the gaps were compounded during the housing bust and subsequent recession.\n\nPAUL TAYLOR : Look at a before-and-after set of snapshots from 2005 to 2009. In 2005, the wealth gap ratios were roughly 10 to one. And they doubled to 20 to one. So they were already big, and they got even bigger. So, what happened? The main driver of these disparate impacts was the housing market. Blacks and Hispanics have fewer financial assets. Wealth-wealth is a combination of all your assets-your home, your car, your 401(k), your stocks, if you have them-minus all your debts-your mortgage, your car loan, your student loan, your credit card. The financial portfolio of blacks and Hispanics are much more dependent on their housing wealth than on anything else. They don't have much else. So when the housing market tanked, as it started to in 2006, it disproportionately impacted blacks and Hispanics. On top of that, there was a regional impact. The housing market rose higher and fell more steeply in certain sections of the country.\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : That was Paul Taylor of the Pew Research Center. According to Pew's new report, Latinos and African Americans have been particularly hard hit by the recession.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : In 2009, white households had a median net worth of just over $113,000. In stark contrast, Latinos had $6,300, and African Americans had not quite $5,700. Between 2005 and 2009, whites lost 16 percent of their median net worth, but Latinos lost 66 percent, black households 53 percent, and Asians, who had topped white households in 2005, dropped 54 percent.\n\nTo discuss this growing wealth gap and what it means, we're joined by Roderick Harrison of Howard University, sociologist, demographer and former chief of racial statistics at the Census Bureau.\n\nProfessor Harrison, welcome to Democracy Now! Talk about the significance of what we're seeing. Between blacks and whites, we're talking 20 to one in the wealth gap?\n\nRODERICK HARRISON : It really takes us back to a period where-characterized by the Kerner Commission as two societies, separate and unequal. This is a chasm that just is striking. And the drops, the effects of the recession, the two-thirds loss in Hispanic wealth, the cutting black wealth in half, you usually don't see cuts that dramatic. This is really suggesting just how hard the recession and the collapse of the housing market has hit these two minority populations.\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : Well, in terms-the importance of assessing the wealth gap versus the income gap, because obviously the income gap is a year-to-year situation, whereas the wealth gap is really sort of the accumulation of all the disparities of generations, really, whether it's-you could be earning a lot of money as an African American, but if you have discriminatory lending rates or other matters, you're still being penalized, subsequently. So, but here we have a situation where the Obama presidency was supposed to, for many people, bring in a post-racial America, where there was a greater sense of equality among the races, and yet we're seeing this enormous step backward. Your sense of what it means for this concept of a post-racial America?\n\nRODERICK HARRISON : It means that, clearly, any hopes or aspirations, particularly based solely on Obama's election, that we had reached some kind of post-racial state were, you know, close to delusional. The socioeconomic realities have not changed on the ground. And this report is pointing to just how much the socioeconomic inequalities have been exacerbated by the recession and the poor economy. It has hit, as it historically does, lower-income minorities, less-educated populations, much more heavily than others. And this report has shown very graphically the consequences of this. So any-I think the sense that perhaps the willingness to elect the first black president does suggest some degree of importantry of moving beyond race in our society, but clearly, that has-doesn't change the kind of socioeconomic realities that are the consequence of centuries and decades of inequality.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Professor Harrison, you were the chief of racial statistics at the Census Bureau. Can you talk about the trends, but also what shocked you most by this latest study?\n\nRODERICK HARRISON : Well, the trends have been-you mentioned, in the previous question, the difference between income and wealth. We've been seeing now for decades increases in inequalities in income. And this is-there are many factors in that, including the incredibly-the incredible increases in the ratio of the incomes of executives and managers to workers within firms. But also, some of it is driven by the growth of the very good incomes of families with two college-educated workers and the stagnation of wages amongst males and a very slow growth amongst females and very slow growth amongst people with less than a college education. So, these things have contributed to the gap. And one would expect that since you do need to make sufficient income to be able to have savings that you can invest, whether it's in savings accounts or stocks, bonds, etc., one would expect the increase in income inequality to gradually produce increases in wealth inequality, as well. But clearly, the recession has, just in a few short years, thrown us into a truly different world. The black and Hispanic income levels, you mentioned, wiped out 20 years of gains; they're back to where they were in 1993, approximately. So-\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : I wanted to ask you about the specific impact of the housing crisis, especially in terms of the dramatic drop-as you say, two-thirds of wealth among Hispanic Americans. Much of the population growth of the Latino community was in states that experienced the greatest housing boom-Nevada, Arizona, Florida, California. And so, therefore, when the bust hit particularly hard in those states, it obviously must have had an enormous impact on the-on any kind of net worth that the Latinos in those states particularly-although it was true across the country, but those states were among the hardest hit in the subprime and in the general housing crisis.\n\nRODERICK HARRISON : You're exactly correct. These were very hot real estate markets, very rapid expansions of population and of housing values, and the states that are amongst the highest in foreclosure rates. And that really does account for the much higher loss in net worth, two-thirds loss in net worth in the Hispanic population, compared to the 50 percent loss in the black population and in the Asian population, which is also concentrated in states like California, and West Coast, that have been severely hit. The black losses and the Hispanic losses do reflect the higher concentration of subprime loans and of foreclosures in heavily black and Hispanic neighborhoods, as well. So we're seeing really the devastating effects that the collapse of the housing markets and the very costs of it, the subprime loans, is now having. And these consequences will be with us for decades to come.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Roderick Harrison, maybe you could comment on how this fits into that issue of housing. The U.S. Department of of Justice is investigating allegations that Wells Fargo discriminated against African-American borrowers. The allegations assert the bank directed African-American borrowers to high-interest subprime mortgages even when they could afford regular mortgages. How does that play into this trend?\n\nRODERICK HARRISON : It plays very heavily into this trend of-again, the housing collapse was triggered by, and has been most severe in, areas where subprime mortgages were most heavily concentrated. And it is true this is the most recent investigation, but over the past several years there have been others that do seem to indicate that not only Wells Fargo, but other major banks and mortgage brokers, in a sense, preyed on the black population, steering them into the subprime mortgages that were more profitable-higher interest rates, less favorable conditions-to the banks and to brokers, even amongst those who were qualified.\n\nAnd then the market itself was trying to-was-the only place to grow for mortgage markets was into populations that had historically lower home ownership rates. The black and Hispanic home ownership rates is about 50 percent compared to 75 percent for whites. So, much of the past decade or two, the only growth market for banks in mortgages was into the minority and lower-income populations. So, we're seeing now the effects of those discriminatory practices and the efforts to extend homeownership, perhaps laudable efforts at-looked laudable at the time, into segments of the population that-for whom it was a stretch.\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : I want to ask you to, if you can, to look into the future, in terms of where the situation is right now, because obviously there's this continuing, persistent high unemployment throughout the country, but especially in the African-American and Latino communities, and increasingly, as local governments are reducing their workforces, trying to cut pension benefits, certainly for African Americans, and not so much perhaps for Latinos and for Asian Americans, government employment has been a huge conveyor belt for many African Americans to rise into the middle class, working in local and state governments and in the federal government. Your sense of what this portends for the future of the wealth gap, if these current trends continue?\n\nRODERICK HARRISON : I think the prospects, at least for the next decade or two, are fairly grim. You're quite correct. African Americans have higher percentages in the government sector than in the private sector, or relatively, compared to the general population. And these have been important avenues of opportunity that the recession is hitting heavily and that will cut into the employment and income of many workers, and many of them disproportionately black. These do have cumulating effects. Clearly, people who suffer job losses or have family members or relatives who do, often start drawing down on savings and on whatever assets they can convert to maintain their-to pay their bills and keep going until hopefully they can regain employment. This has, no doubt, contributed, a much smaller proportion than the housing problems, to some of the decline in the net worth of black and Hispanic families who have been-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : What would be the most-what would be the single most effective way to reverse this trend, Roderick Harrison?\n\nRODERICK HARRISON : It's going to be very difficult. We've started out by noting that the major cause of this is the collapse in home values and home equity, which is the primary, and in many cases the sole, source of wealth for most families, and especially for black and Hispanic families. We're seeing a very slow recovery in employment, so the unemployment problems, the underemployment, the discouraged worker percentages will continue to persist for some years to come. And the housing market shows very few signs of recovery, and one would think that it's going to take five to 10 years, at least, before housing values recover. And the neighborhoods that were hit the hardest with foreclosures, and were lower housing values to begin with-black and Hispanic neighborhoods, lower-income neighborhoods-are almost certainly going to be the last to recover in the housing market. So you've had this massive drop, two-thirds, one-half drop in net worth, black, Hispanic, Asian populations. I don't see this recovering for the next 10 years or so. I don't see them-if they can recoup, if they can get back to the net worth levels that they were in 2005 within the next 10 years, I would be surprised.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Roderick Harrison-\n\nRODERICK HARRISON : Now-mm-hmm?\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We want to thank you very much for being with us. You just said \"now,\" so last point?\n\nRODERICK HARRISON : People use net worth or draw on net worth to invest in their children's education, to help with perhaps a first home, a down payment for a first home. We're entering a period now where black and Hispanic families, one-third of whom have no net worth at all or negative net worth, won't be able to help their children in this way. So this is going to definitely play into the next generation.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Roderick Harrison, associate professor of sociology at Howard University, former chief of racial statistics at the Census Bureau.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

I'm Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh.\n\nWe continue now to look at Afghanistan and conditions for women, reporters, those working for peace. On Wednesday, Afghan news presenter Shabnam Dawran said in a video, shared on Twitter, she was prohibited by the Taliban from returning to work.\n\nSHABNAM DAWRAN : [translated] My name is Shabnam Dawran. I have been a journalist for six years, and I have been working with Mili Television, when I heard that the new Taliban system's rules have changed.  With the courage that I had in me, I went to the office to start my work, but the current system's soldiers didn't give me permission to start my work. They told me that \"The regime has changed. You are not allowed. Go home.\" I am asking the world to help me, because my life is in danger.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : For more, we're joined by two more Afghan women who have left their country, both of them now in Toronto, Canada.\n\nMariam Safi left Afghanistan just a few weeks ago, in July. She's the founding executive director of Organization for Policy Research and Development Studies, known as DROPS , and the co-director of the Afghanistan Mechanism for Inclusive Peace.\n\nAnd we're joined by Zahra Nader. She's a freelance Afghan journalist who was a reporter for The New York Times in Kabul. She's now based in Toronto, where she's a Ph.D. student in gender and women's studies at York University. She was born in Bamiyan, Afghanistan, and lived in Iran as a refugee for seven years, returning to Afghanistan in 2003. She fled her native home in 2017 due to mounting dangers she faced as a woman, a reporter and a member of the Hazara ethnic minority, which for decades has been targeted by militants, including the Taliban, as well as the Islamic State.\n\nWe welcome you both to Democracy Now! Mariam, let's begin with you. You left but were planning to return very soon to Afghanistan. Talk about what's happened and what you're hearing back in Afghanistan right now with your organization and the people who work for it.\n\nMARIAM SAFI : The situation in Afghanistan at the present moment, of course, is one that is endowed with frustration, uncertainty, fear. That is the perception, and that is the sentiment we're hearing from those that we're in contact with on the ground.\n\nAnd what had happened and transpired in the last few days is something that we really had not anticipated, and it was a complete shock and disbelief to all of us. We had felt that there would be some space for a political settlement. And while things were getting very difficult in the last few months between the negotiating parties, we felt that there was some degree of space there for negotiations to result in a positive solution. So what has happened has certainly caught everyone by surprise.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Mariam, could you clarify: What would you say would be a positive resolution? What did you hope the negotiations would accomplish?\n\nMARIAM SAFI : Well, what all members of Afghan civil society and Afghans in Afghan society had hoped for was a political settlement, a political settlement to bring an end to the violence that had plagued Afghanistan for so very long. And a political settlement would have looked like a situation where both parties would come together. And, of course, there would be certain compromises, on the one hand, but there would also be certain promises and commitments, particularly in protecting the gains of the last 20 years. And it would have - and so, that is what we were hoping to achieve. It was never one victory over another, and we all realized that a military solution to this conflict did not exist. So, a political settlement would have looked as one that would have protected the gains of the last 20 years for Afghans. But, as you see, that certainly did not happen.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Zahra Nader, could you talk about your own experience having fled Afghanistan, not once, but twice, as a refugee? And in particular, you worked as a journalist there. Can you say what you've heard about how the Taliban has been responding to the attacks on journalists in Afghanistan just in the last few days?\n\nZAHRA NADER : Thank you. Thank you for having me here.\n\nI have been a refugee twice. And, you know, it is very, very hard to leave as a refugee. The first time, when the Taliban take over Afghanistan, my family fled to Iran. And as a refugee, I did not have any rights to education, to do what other children were doing. And that was very, very heartbreaking for me. And seeing that happening again in Afghanistan is really, really painful for me. And this is just awful that every day it is happening to Afghanistan.\n\nAbout my work in Afghanistan, so, I worked at least around seven years as a journalist in Afghanistan. And in all my works, I was very focused on women's issue. I wanted to cover the story of Afghan women, to see what they are doing in their lives and what is their problem and what's the problem that they are dealing with. And so, in all those years, I have never imagined that we would reach this day, that we would again live under the Taliban. I'm talking to my friends back home in Afghanistan, my journalist friends, my prosecutor friends, my friends that work with the government, you know, at different level, and they're all saying, \"You know, it seems to us that our life was on pause for 20 years, and now we are just again going back, starting from 2001, where we left.\" So, that is very heartbreaking right now for me to listen to their stories and see what they are going through right now.\n\nThis is how I'm feeling right now. You know, my family and everybody is at home. And the fear of that, that fear that I had when I was a refugee, a 6-years-old girl fleeing Afghanistan in the back of a car, and I'm now seeing that happening in front of the airport - lots of children, like, dragging, being, you know, in the stressful. What would happen, this - even the seeing, the experiencing of this situation that these people, women, everybody is facing in Afghanistan, that is a trauma that will never leave them, as it did not leave - the fear, the experience that I had as a refugee, they still exist in me. They have, like - I have fear. There are scars in my heart, that as I go, as I go in my ways, it come back to me and make life harder for me. And I can't imagine that this is going to happen for the new generation in Afghanistan.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I wanted to ask you about being part of the Hazara minority and talk about Bamiyan, where you were born. Bamiyan may be known by the world because the Taliban blew up the Bamiyan statues, the Buddhas that were carved, back in 2001. They were blown up by the Taliban on orders from the leader at the time, Mullah Mohammed Omar, after the Taliban government declared they were idols. They also destroyed part of the statue of the Hazara leader, Abdul Ali Mazari, in Bamiyan, who they had killed back in 1995. Can you talk about the Taliban 2.0 that people are talking about today, back to then, and you, as a Hazara, how you feel about what's happening to your people in Afghanistan?\n\nZAHRA NADER : I feel that they would be definitely marginalized. At least for past 20 years, they received some rights. You know, they can - they get education. They worked. Even though it was there always - the systematic discrimination always existed against them in Afghanistan, but it was much better. But now I feel, with the coming of the Taliban, so we can see they are just, you know, mullahs and from one particular ethnicity, and they would not tolerate other groups being part of their regime, although they are saying it. But I am fearful of, like, how people, not only Hazara people, but all people of Afghanistan, would live under the Taliban, you know, because, basically, they are the people who are coming from behind the mountains. They spent all their life fighting, and now they are here to rule our society. And I'm very, very fearful of that, how that would unfold for our future, for future of our country.\n\nSpecifically talking about the Hazara problem, we have tried a lot to tell the international community that we are - there is lots of discrimination, systematic discrimination, against Hazara people in Afghanistan. But it seems it wasn't getting very much response. But now it's even going to get even worse, because this group that are now in power in Afghanistan, they do not care about human rights, they do not care about women's rights, and they do not care about Hazara or any minority people's rights. And they would do anything that they can. They would do definitely what they did, you know, in 1990s. We know that they massacred Hazara in Mazar. They did in Bamiyan. So, all of those are just the pictures that are coming up to us, and a very, very traumatizing moment for all of us.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Mariam, you know, we hear a lot in the press, here and elsewhere, of course, about what's happening in Kabul. Could you talk about what you know of the changes that have occurred in rural areas, as well as in urban areas, and the distinction between the two? Because, of course, the reports are that the Taliban has been advancing across rural areas for much of the last year, and the government has really only - Ashraf Ghani's administration has only been fully in control of urban areas. Could you talk about that?\n\nMARIAM SAFI : Well, I think that to say that rural areas were under the control of the Taliban, while urban was under the control of the government, that's not entirely true. Yes, the Taliban did control certain parts of the country. There are studies that showed that about 11% - in May, there was a study that I had come upon that showed 11% of the population lived under Taliban-controlled territory. So, that's 11%, and this was in May. There were districts that were contested, and then there was districts - and that was a good majority - that was under the control of the Afghan government. So, that was the scenario in May, and that has rapidly changed now, obviously.\n\nBut in Afghanistan in the last 20 years, a lot of the development efforts have been focused and centered on cities and in urban areas. And so, urban areas have seen, have benefited a lot from the international intervention, whereas rural areas, particularly villages and districts - provincial city centers have still been better, but rural areas and villages and districts have not - have barely seen that amount of development. And that's particularly been because of either violence, corruption and other factors that have prevented that from taking place.\n\nSo, it's quite - it's a mixed bag. And so, I would say that we have to be careful when we're looking at the rural and urban divide in Afghanistan. There's many, many drivers of conflict in Afghanistan, and there are many, many factors that have played a role in the last 20 years in how this divide has sort of increased and why.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I mean, the president leaving was a shock to so many, right? Ashraf Ghani. It wasn't so much that the Taliban seized power in Kabul as they entered this vacuum. It wasn't that the Afghan government, that the military was fighting them. They just left, despite the billions that the U.S. military had put into them. Talk about that shock and why you think that the Afghan government, under Ashraf Ghani, was so unpopular. Can you talk about it being, for example, what our next guest will talk about, a kleptocracy?\n\nMARIAM SAFI : Well, I would say that a lot of what has transpired in the last five days, particularly on Sunday, when the president - we all heard that President Ghani had left, I think it's too early at this present moment to say exactly what took place, and I do not want to speculate. But I will say that the Afghan National Security Forces - and I've been seeing reports that have suggested that the Afghan National Security Forces basically just surrendered the country. I would say it wasn't the forces; it was certainly the leadership. There was a problem. There was a grave, grave problem in leadership. Poor leadership, political disunity have been a factor of where we are today, and there's no doubt in that.\n\nAnd the Afghan National Security Forces themselves fought against all odds in these last few years, in these recent years, and particularly in these last few months. When there's no reinforcement, when they're not getting enough resources and they're left to both fight and defend for themselves, then it becomes very difficult. And so, the Afghan National Security Forces, I would say - even the development of the Afghan National Security Forces in the last 10 to 12 years, I would say, is when this force was actually built, when it was in fact supposed to have been built in 2001.\n\nAnd it was the United States that took the responsibility of building the Afghan National Security Forces, under the lead program. And while they built an Afghan National Security Forces in large numbers, this was a force that they were both building capacity while they were also teaching them literacy at the same time. And in this process, there were a lot of areas where dependency upon the U.S. forces and NATO forces was something that was established. So there was a dependency on certain resources needed from the United States and other forces.\n\nSo, the dependency was there. It was still a young army, at the end of the day. And building this army itself faced a lot of difficulties in the last few years. I think they fought - they did what they could, but, unfortunately, I would say, the leadership failed them. And then, that's what studies will show you, and that's what reports in media would show you, that it certainly was a failure of leadership.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Mariam Safi, I want to thank you for being with us, executive director of the Organization for Policy Research and Development Studies, co-director of the Afghanistan Mechanism for Inclusive Peace, and Zahra Nader, Afghan journalist, Ph.D. student at York University, both speaking to us from Canada.\n\nNext up, Washington Post reporter Craig Whitlock on the longest war in U.S. history; his new book, The Afghanistan Papers: A Secret History of the War ; what the U.S. generals, what the U.S. government over the past 20 years did not tell us about what they were doing in Afghanistan.

I'm Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : We turn now to China, where a shocking new exposé has revealed that Chinese authorities are systematically forcing Muslims - mostly Uyghurs and Kazakhs - into labor programs to supply Chinese factories with a cheap and compliant workforce.\n\nThe New York Times investigation, headlined \"Inside China's Push to Turn Muslim Minorities into an Army of Workers,\" is based on official documents, interviews with leading experts and visits to the far-western region of Xinjiang, where about half of the population is Muslim.\n\nWhat it reveals is a sweeping program to push poor farmers, villagers and small traders into sometimes months-long training courses before assigning them to low-wage factory work. The programs work in tandem with indoctrination camps where an estimated 1 million adults from the Uyghur community are being imprisoned.\n\nChina claims its labor programs are designed to combat extremism and alleviate poverty. Uyghur activists say they're part of China's ongoing campaign to strip them of their language and community and carry out nothing short of cultural genocide.\n\nThe New York Times obtained rare footage taken inside one of China's labor programs.\n\nNARRATOR : In a far corner of northwestern China, a car drives along a wall lined with barbed wire, heading towards what looks like a standard apartment complex. Access here is restricted, and the cameraperson is filming secretly.\n\nPASSENGER : [translated] Filming is prohibited. Don't film.\n\nDRIVER : [translated] I'm not going to. I'm just going to follow you inside and take a look.\n\nPASSENGER : [translated] Fine.\n\nNARRATOR : Because this is no ordinary residence. It's part of a contentious labor resettlement program run by the Chinese government to extend state control over Muslim minorities, mostly Uyghurs, by moving them from one part of China to work in another. This covert, low-quality footage, that we've adjusted to reveal some details and obscure others, gives us some rare insights into how people in this program live and are indoctrinated.\n\nTEXT : [translated] \"Love the Party. Love the Country. Love the family of the Chinese Nation.\" \"Anti-Separatism. Anti-Extremism. Anti-Violence.\"\n\nNARRATOR : Over the last few years, the mass incarceration of more than a million Uyghurs and Kazakhs by the Chinese government has led to international outrage. These labor programs are part of that larger story.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That, a New York Times exposé .\n\nFor more, we go to Hong Kong, where we're joined by Austin Ramzy, The New York Times reporter who co-authored the recent exposé. And in Washington, D.C., we're joined by Nury Turkel, Uyghur-American attorney, board chair of the Uyghur Human Rights Project.\n\nWe welcome you both to Democracy Now! Austin, let's begin with you. Can you lay out the significance of these documents that you got? Explain where you got them from, hundreds of pages, and what they say.\n\nAUSTIN RAMZY : We received hundreds of pages of documents from a member of the Chinese political elite that revealed the origin of the internment camps in Xinjiang and how the Chinese leadership, including Xi Jinping, beginning in 2014, pushed for a solution to what he saw as extremism and terrorism and violence that needed to be controlled, put under control in Xinjiang. And so he called for a tough solution.\n\nAnd in the years that followed, we saw a beginning of small-level internment camps. And then, beginning in - after 2016, a new party secretary came into Xinjiang and began a large-scale internment operation that led to the - you know, as many as a million people who were put into these camps.\n\nThe documents also revealed that - you know, publicly, the Chinese government has described these camps as training centers to give people skills to help them [inaudible] that will steer them away from extremism. But in the language of the documents themselves, it describes these as - these programs as punishment. And it shows that the authorities are plainly aware of the suffering that is caused, not only to the people in the camps, but to their families and children, who are left without parents.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And can you explain what these camps are? You've got indoctrination camps, and you've got labor camps. And explain how you were able to document what you say is as many as a million people, Uyghur Muslims, Kazakh Muslims, in these camps.\n\nAUSTIN RAMZY : Well, there are multiple programs happening. There's the internment program, which has as many as a million people in these camps. The labor program is separate but related, and it involves taking people from - primarily from southern Xinjiang and sending them to northern Xinjiang, to other parts of China, to work in factories, to work, as the video showed, as street cleaners, to put them in more formal labor, as opposed, often, to the farm work that they did before. It's a separate system of control, not as extreme as the camps themselves, but from everything we've seen, there is coercion involved in forcing these people into this sort of work. These people, some of them include family members of people in camps. So there are connections, and it is related to the overall program of control. But there are many different programs happening in Xinjiang.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Well, Austin, earlier you talked about the fact that, you know, some of these - when these Uyghurs are disappeared from their homes and they have children who return from study either in Hong Kong or other parts of China, they come back and they discover that their family members are gone. What explanation are they given? There's actually a document that's distributed?\n\nAUSTIN RAMZY : That's right. That was one of the most telling documents in the cache that we received. And it outlines basically what local officials in Xinjiang should say to these young people who return home from other parts of China to learn that family members have been put into camps. It was a document from 2017, when the program really began ramping up.\n\nAnd it told officials to tell these young people that their family members had - it uses almost pseudomedical language to say that they've been infected by a virus, and just as if you were infected with an actual virus, you would want a period of treatment. It must be closed treatment so that this won't spread to other people. And it describes these programs as being for their own benefit. But at the same time, there's messages to sort of warn these young people that they themselves should not complain, because only through their agreement will their family members eventually get out.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Austin Ramzy, can you talk about the impact of the forced labor on the global supply chain and the participation by stores, including Muji, Uniqlo, Walmart?\n\nAUSTIN RAMZY : Well, Xinjiang produces about 80 to 85% of China's cotton. China is, of course, a huge clothing manufacturer. And the government has been trying to increase the amount of clothing and textile production in Xinjiang, so some of these labor programs involve clothing and textile factories and are tied with the production of cotton in Xinjiang.\n\nAnd so, Muji and Uniqlo have previously advertised Xinjiang cotton. Muji did not respond to us, but they said last year that they work very hard to ensure that there's no forced labor in their supply chain. Uniqlo said that they do not work with partners in Xinjiang.\n\nBut the short answer is that the significance of China in production of all things and the significance of Xinjiang in terms of clothing and textile production means that it's very risky for companies that have any production connected with Xinjiang, and requires really close investigation of their supply chains.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Well, I'd like to bring in Nury Turkel, a Uyghur-American attorney and activist, board chair at the Uyghur Human Rights Project. Could you, Nury, respond to the significance of this exposé?\n\nNURY TURKEL : These are what we lawyers call an evidence. This is not a speculation. This is not a report done by a third party or NGO . This is a hard evidence, comes straight out from the Chinese government's own archives.\n\nWhat we have today is that in the past two-and-a-half years we've been relying on open-source information on construction bids and the future expansion of the camps, as well as the personal witness accounts, survivors' accounts, to come up with a close-to-reality figure. But now we have evidence. These evidence are so significant and so revealing.\n\nSeveral things comes to mind. One is that this is not a local government officials trying to impress the central government and formulated these policies. This has come, apparently, directly coming from the Chinese Communist Party, General Secretary Xi Jinping, and his local entrusted officials, Chen Quanguo and others. So, we've been saying - these documents confirm -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We have five seconds, Nury.\n\nNURY TURKEL : These documents have confirmed what we have been telling the world in the last two-and-a-half years, but it's incumbent upon the government officials, lawmakers, judges and prosecutors to look into this to see if this constitutes crimes against humanity.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We're going to do Part 2 . Thank you to Nury Turkel as well as to Austin Ramzy of The New York Times .\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

In a 5-to-4 decision, justices ruled Congress has used obsolete information in continuing to require nine states with a history of racial discrimination to obtain federal approval for changes to voting rules. In recent years, Democrats have accused Republicans at the state level of enacting measures including congressional redistricting and voter identification laws to suppress the vote of minority groups likely to support Democratic candidates. We get reaction from three guests: Rev. Jesse Jackson, veteran civil rights leader and founder of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition; Thomas Saenz, president of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund; and Ari Berman, a reporter who covers voting rights for The Nation. \"This cuts at the heart of the whole idea of a broad American social fabric,\" Rev. Jackson says. Berman adds that the challenge came before the high court out of \"a determined movement by conservatives to gut the most important civil rights law in the past 50 years.\"\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : In a major blow for voting rights, the Supreme Court has gutted an integral part of the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act. The act was a crowning achievement of the civil rights movement and helped transform the South. On Tuesday, in a five-to-four decision, the justices ruled that Congress had used obsolete information in continuing to require nine states, mainly in the South, to obtain federal approval for voting rule changes affecting minority voters. The Voting Rights Act was challenged by Shelby County, Alabama, which argued the preclearance requirement has outlived its usefulness.\n\nCongressman John Lewis of Georgia reacted to Tuesday's ruling on MSNBC . He was nearly killed when he participated in the 1965 Bloody Sunday march to Selma, Alabama, to demand the right to vote.\n\nREP . JOHN LEWIS : I was disappointed, because I think what the court did today is stab the Voting Rights Act of 1965 in its very heart. It is a major setback. We may not have people being beaten today. Maybe they're not being denied the right to participate or to register to vote. They're not being chased by police dogs or trampled by horses. But in the 11 states of the Old Confederacy, and even in some of the states outside of the South, there's been a systematic, deliberate attempt to take us back to another period. And these men that voted to strip the Voting Rights Act of its power, they never stood in unmovable lines. They never had to pass a so-called literacy test. It took us almost a hundred years to get where we are today. So will it take another hundred years to fix it, to change it?\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : That was Congressman Lewis reacting to Tuesday's Supreme Court ruling on the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority, quote, \"Our country has changed, and while any racial discrimination in voting is too much, Congress must ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy that problem speaks to current conditions.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote in her dissent, quote, \"The Voting Rights Act became one of the most consequential, efficacious, and amply justified exercises of federal legislative power in our Nation's history.\" President Barack Obama reacted to the ruling with disappointment and asked Congress to pass legislation, quote, \"to ensure every American has equal access to the polls.\"\n\nIn recent years, Democrats have accused Republicans at the state level of enacting measures intended to suppress the vote of minority groups likely to support Democratic candidates. These measures include congressional redistricting and voter identification laws. Just two hours after the ruling, Texas began advancing a voter ID law and redistricting map that were blocked last year for discriminating against African-American and Latino residents.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : For more, we go to Chicago, where we're joined by Reverend Jesse Jackson, civil rights leader, president and founder of Rainbow PUSH Coalition, and by Thomas Saenz, president of MALDEF , the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund. His organization submitted a brief in the Shelby case and brought the other major voting rights case the Supreme Court decided last week, in which it ruled that an Arizona law requiring proof of citizenship from residents as they register to vote is invalid because it violates the National Voter Registration Act. And here in New York, we're joined by Ari Berman, who covers voting rights for The Nation magazine, his recent article headlined \"What the Supreme Court Doesn't Understand About the Voting Rights Act.\"\n\nWe welcome you all to Democracy Now! Reverend Jesse Jackson, let's begin with you. Your reaction to the Supreme Court decision?\n\nREV . JESSE JACKSON : Well, first-good morning-a source of deep pain. My father came from World War II, had to sit behind lots of POWs on American military bases and did not have the right to vote. I've grown up with this all of my life. I marched in Selma, Alabama, for the right to vote; went to jail trying to get Mandela his right to vote. We've been fighting the struggle to democratize our nation and our nations for a long time, and so it hurt at that level. On the other hand, the shift from federal oversight to states' rights abuses is a radical shift, and the impact will be devastating unless President Barack Obama, I think, moves quickly and goes to Congress, as President Johnson did, and speaks to the nation about the significance of the integrity of our democracy having been stripped on yesterday.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Ari Berman, can you explain the significance of what happened and the importance, in particular, of Section 5 and Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act?\n\nARI BERMAN : Sure. Well, Section 5 is really the most important part of the Voting Rights Act. That's what's given the law its teeth historically, because it forced states with the worst history of voting discrimination to have to clear their changes with the federal government, and it shifted the burden of proof onto the discriminators as opposed to those who had been discriminated against for so many years. What Justice Roberts said is that the way that states are covered under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, Section 4 is unconstitutional. So, right now Section 5 is a ghost. There are no states covered under Section 5. Congress would have to rewrite the law in some way that would satisfy the justices to actually give Section 5 some teeth again, because right now it really doesn't exist.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to turn to comments made by Justice Antonin Scalia during oral arguments for the case. He suggested certain provisions of the Voting Rights Act were a form of, quote, \"racial entitlement.\"\n\nJUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA : I think it is attributable, very likely attributable, to a phenomenon that is called perpetuation of racial entitlement. It's been written about. Whenever a society adopts racial entitlements, it is very difficult to get out of them through the normal political processes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That is Antonin Scalia. Thomas Saenz of the MALDEF , your response to what happened yesterday and to what Scalia said?\n\nTHOMAS SAENZ : Well, I think that the justice's comments and, indeed, yesterday's decision really demonstrate how out of touch the Supreme Court majority is with the reality of life in America today. The simple fact is that this very powerful tool to enforce voting rights against some very recalcitrant, egregious violators through history of the rights of minorities to vote is very important and vital today. We saw in 2012, through the season leading up to the election, that there were efforts in covered jurisdictions, and indeed in other jurisdictions, to restrict the vote, to impose voter ID requirements that would deter participation, that would prevent participation, of thousands and thousands of voters. This measure, that was basically disabled by the court yesterday, prevented many of those measures from taking effect. And even in the jurisdictions that are not covered by Section 5, they saw what happened in Section 5 jurisdictions, and it was a clear demonstration that those laws needed to be stopped because they were violative of voting rights. So this is a vital tool that's been disabled because the court majority is simply out of touch with what's going on in communities across the country.\n\nREV . JESSE JACKSON : Amy.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Yes, Reverend Jackson?\n\nREV . JESSE JACKSON : Amy? May I hasten to say, it's black and Latino, but not just that. With [inaudible] in '65, blacks could not vote, but white women could not serve on juries in much of the South. That was eight-one on the Supreme Court. Eighteen-year-olds were serving in Vietnam; they could not vote. Students could not vote on campuses; they either had to vote absentee or go home to vote. You could not vote bilingual until 1975. So we democratized democracy. This cuts at the heart of the whole idea of a broadened American social fabric.\n\nAnd what these states will do during that 25 years, from '65 to 1990, they used gerrymandering, as they're now doing in Texas to cut down Latino officials, or the case of Cleo Fields in Louisiana, they used gerrymandering, annexation and laws [inaudible]. All these schemes will now become fashionable again. It will take very expensive lawsuits to defeat them. That's why I hope President Obama will take the lead, in fact, as President Johnson did ultimately, and go to the Congress and to the nation and make the case for the nation on our-protect the right to vote for all Americans.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to play a clip of President Lyndon Johnson speaking just as he's about to sign the Voting Rights Act in 1965. His comments are followed by remarks from Dr. Martin Luther King.\n\nPRESIDENT LYNDON JOHNSON : Today is a triumph for freedom, as huge as any victory that's ever been won on any battlefield. This law covers many pages, but the heart of the act is plain. Wherever, by clear and objective standards, states and counties are using regulations or laws or tests to deny the right to vote, then they will be struck down. If it is clear that state officials still intend to discriminate, then federal examiners will be sent in to register all eligible voters. This good Congress, the 89th Congress, acted swiftly in passing this act. And I intend to act with equal dispatch in enforcing this act.\n\nREV . DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.: I think the greatest victory of this period was not in terms of an external factor or an external development, but it was something internal. The real victory was what this period did to the psyche of the black man. And the greatness of this period was that we armed ourselves with dignity and self-respect. The greatness of this period was that we straightened our backs up. And a man can't ride your back unless it's bent.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That's a clip of Dr. Martin Luther King, and, before him, President Lyndon Johnson, handing him the pen he used to sign the Voting Rights Act of 1965. It's from the documentary King: A Filmed Record...From Montgomery to Memphis . I wanted to ask you, Reverend Jackson, where were you on that day?\n\nREV . JESSE JACKSON : Well, I was in Chicago by that time and just celebrating the greatest August 6, really, 1965. And what a joyful moment it was. Reminds me again of just how much-how underappreciated is Lyndon Baines Johnson. Only Lincoln stands as tall as Lyndon Johnson in this quest to make America America for all of its people. He does not get the credit he really deserves.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And this is the 50th anniversary-we're coming up in August-of the March on Washington, so significant, Jesse Jackson and Thomas Saenz. I wanted to ask Thomas Saenz of MALDEF what this specifically means for the Latino community. If you can talk about the states that we're referring to here?\n\nTHOMAS SAENZ : Well, for the Latino community, the two critical states, in particular, are Texas and Arizona, which are covered by Section 5. And, indeed, in this last round of redistricting, as you've heard and stated, the Texas Legislature adopted maps for Congress and for its state House that basically prevented Latinos from electing candidates of their choice. And it was through the intervention of Section 5 that that map was prevented from taking effect. Similarly, a voter ID provision that Texas sought to implement in 2012, that would have made it even more difficult to vote in that state for those without readily at hand the kind of limited documents required under that law, was barred from taking effect because of a lack of preclearance under the very provision that was essentially disabled yesterday by the Supreme Court. And in Arizona 10 years ago, in its redistricting process, Section 5 served to prevent the implementation of maps that would have, again, prevented the Latino community from electing candidates that they chose. So, this has been a critically important tool in ensuring that the rights to vote of Latinos across the country, but particularly in Texas and Arizona, have been protected and preserved.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Ari Berman, how is it, could you explain, that this-the Voting Rights Act, which has been in place for almost five decades and was recently renewed for another 25 years-what accounts for this decision taking place now? And could you talk about, specifically, Chief Justice Roberts' role in this ruling?\n\nARI BERMAN : Sure. Well, there's really been a long war in the conservative movement against the Voting Rights Act. John Roberts, when he was a young lawyer in the Reagan Justice Department, led the fight against another part of the Voting Rights Act. He lost that fight. But it's clear that when Roberts got on the court, this was going to be an issue that he wanted to deal with. He wanted to be able to undo what he couldn't do in the 1980s.\n\nAnd you look at inside the conservative movement today. There is a group called the Project on Fair Representation, which brought this case, which found the plaintiff, which paid for the lawyers. They are funded by the largest members in the conservative movement, by a group called Donors Trust, which receives money from the Koch brothers and so many other large conservative funders. That allowed the Project on Fair Representation and other conservative groups to have the resources to find these challenges, to bring them to the court, to get them before a receptive audience. We don't know-if it wasn't for this one group, the Project on Fair Representation, this challenge may never have even come to the court. So, really, this is not an accident. It's really a determined movement by conservatives to gut the most important civil rights law in the last 50 years.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Can you speak specifically-the group that you're talking about-the role of Ed Blum?\n\nARI BERMAN : Ed Blum runs the Project on Fair Representation. He is a conservative who lost a seat for Congress in the 1990s. He believed he was the victim of unfair racial gerrymandering that was mandated by the Voting Rights Act, so he then devoted his life to basically lessening the use of race in public policy, as he said. He founded the Project on Fair Representation with the help of the American Enterprise Institute in 2005 to challenge a 2006 reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act. He lost that battle overwhelmingly. Congress reauthorized the Voting Rights Act 390 to 33 in the House and 98 to zero in the Senate-margins that we just don't see on anything today. And when Blum lost in Congress, he decided to go for the courts. And when John Roberts became chief justice, he knew he had an ideological ally on the court.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Let's go to the exchange between Chief Justice John Roberts and Solicitor General Donald Verrilli. Roberts questions Verrilli on voter turnout statistics during the oral arguments.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE JOHN ROBERTS : Do you know which state has the worst ratio of white voter turnout to African-American voter turnout?\n\nSOLICITOR GENERAL DONALD VERRILLI JR.: I do not.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE JOHN ROBERTS : Massachusetts. Do you know what has the best?\n\nSOLICITOR GENERAL DONALD VERRILLI JR.: As to-\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE JOHN ROBERTS : Where African-American turnout actually exceeds white turnout? Mississippi.\n\nSOLICITOR GENERAL DONALD VERRILLI JR.: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, but Congress recognized that expressly in the findings when it reauthorized the act in 2006. It said that the first-generation problems had been largely dealt with, but there persisted significant-\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE JOHN ROBERTS : Which state has the greatest disparity in registration between white and African American?\n\nSOLICITOR GENERAL DONALD VERRILLI JR.: I do not know that. But-\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE JOHN ROBERTS : Massachusetts. Third is Mississippi, where, again, the African-American registration rate is higher than the white registration rate.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That was Chief Justice Roberts. Ari Berman?\n\nARI BERMAN : Well, number one, the chief justice is wrong in his use of statistics. But the second thing is it's very misleading just to look at registration. You look at Mississippi versus Massachusetts. Massachusetts has an African-American governor, Deval Patrick. Mississippi has never elected an African-American candidate to any statewide office, despite having among, if not the largest African-American percentage of any state. So, it's very misleading. What the Voting Rights Act did is it allowed people to register to vote. But then what happened, as the solicitor general said, a whole host of second- and third-generation barriers started coming out. And we've seen, through redistricting, through different laws, an attempt to stop that movement in the electorate.\n\nAnd one of the big stories-I think the biggest story-in the South right now is the tension between demographic change and voter suppression. A third of the country lives in the South right now. One of the consequences of the Voting Rights Act was that it turned the South from Democratic to Republican. It's shifting back now Democratic. If you look at Barack Obama, he won three states of the Old Confederacy. Republicans are aware of that. That's why they've redistricted so aggressively since the 2010 election, and that's why states like North Carolina, Virginia, Arkansas, etc., are rushing to pass new voting restrictions now. And without Section 5, it's going to be open season in the South to try to pass new laws that can thwart the impact of demographic changes.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Reverend Jesse Jackson, I'd like to ask you what you think the Obama administration can do now? The administration has been extremely critical of the Supreme Court ruling. What kind of steps can the administration now take?\n\nREV . JESSE JACKSON : I didn't hear you.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Sorry. Reverend Jackson, I'm asking you what steps the Obama administration can now take in light of this ruling? They've been very critical.\n\nREV . JESSE JACKSON : This is the time to convene this bipartisan meeting of leadership in the White House. He can do that, number one. The next step, of course, is for the president to go to the Congress, as President Johnson did, and make his case to the Congress and to the nation, because there is a-seems to me to be a kind of a period here where people, like some of the Republicans, are a bit caught off-guard by the devastating impact and the reaction to this. This is the time for him to move rather immediately to the Congress and to the American public. If there ever were a time to make a case to the American public about the advantages of a broad-based democracy, it is now. When Mr. Roberts says we've done well over these years-well, you know, just watch the spine-tingling game between the Spurs and the Miami Heat. But this integrity was protected by referees. Referees and oversighters matter. If you remove oversight, all you get what you're getting in Texas already. I was in South Carolina last week. They sent back $11 billion of Medicaid money. They didn't want federal intervention. And sent back a billion dollars of education money. This Confederate ideology is very-tea party, is 150 years old. The ideology of turning back the clock and removing federal intervention is their preoccupation.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : In a victory for voting rights, just last week the Supreme Court struck down an Arizona law that requires people to provide proof of citizenship when they complete their voter registration form. In his majority opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote, quote, \"We conclude that the fairest reading of the statute is that a state-imposed requirement of evidence of citizenship not required by the Federal Form is 'inconsistent with' the [National Voting Rights Act's] mandate that States 'accept and use' the Federal Form.\" Thomas Saenz, you're the president of MALDEF , which brought the challenge to the court. Can you talk about this case and how it relates to the taking down of the Voting Rights Act?\n\nTHOMAS SAENZ : Well, I think that that case indicates that Congress does have the power and authority under the Constitution to step in and prevent specific practices, like requiring documentary proof of citizenship before being allowed to register, as Arizona attempted to do. The motor voter law, also better known as the National Voter Registration Act, clearly establishes one form to register to vote in federal elections. That form requires you to sign, under penalty of perjury, a claim-stating that you are a citizen. It does not require you to come forward with any document to prove your citizenship. Arizona tried to add that additional requirement to register in its state, and the Supreme Court majority, seven to two, concluded that the NVRA did not permit that.\n\nWhat that case demonstrates is that Congress can act, needs to act to prevent the most egregious attempts to limit voting rights. It can act, more specifically in reaction to yesterday's decision, to include that certain practices are covered by a preclearance mechanism. Certain jurisdictions, again, are covered by a preclearance mechanism. But it can also affirmatively act and say, \"We are going to establish across the country a uniform voter registration procedure,\" as it did with the motor voter law, as the Supreme Court concluded a week ago.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I wanted to wrap up by moving to another subject, Reverend Jesse Jackson. It's the health of former South African President Nelson Mandela. He's in critical condition. He's 94 years old, suffering from a lung infection. Can you give us final words today about Mandela, a man you certainly knew well?\n\nREV . JESSE JACKSON : Well, I talked with his grandson yesterday. He is gravely ill. But death cannot take from us what Mandela has already given to us, which will last beyond his death. His strength-he tried to fight to end apartheid legislatively, with litigation, as a militarist. Finally, he out-suffered the system. He not only is an historical figure, but as a transformative, he came up with the power to retaliate: He chose reconciliation and reconstruction. So his stature in the world community will outlast whatever season he's in now of grave illness and of death. We pray for his continued recovery. He is not dead yet. We pray for him and for his family during this hour of challenge.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Reverend Jesse Jackson; Thomas Saenz of MALDEF , the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund; and Ari Berman of The Nation , we thank you all for being with us.\n\nThis is Democracy Now! When we come back, we're going to the Texas state House, where it was high drama into the early hours around abortion rights. Stay with us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

      "text": "The allure of fascism: why do minorities join the far right?\n\nA white supremacist ideology would appear to be antithetical to people of color, but there's a perverse logic at play when they join extremist groups\n\nW hile investigators search for a motive behind a Texas man's mass killing of eight people at an outlet mall near Dallas earlier this month, they and groups such as the Anti-Defamation League believe they have uncovered social media posts in which he spewed white supremacist, misogynist and antisemitic rhetoric.\n\nExperts say Mauricio Garcia's apparent expression of hate-filled rhetoric fits into a modest but increasingly alarming pattern of largely men of color drawn to far-right communities. Since the election of Donald Trump, they say, more men of color have taken on leadership roles in far-right and militia groups and participated, and in some cases led, violent protests, most notably during the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol.\n\nFor people of Latino descent like Garcia, who self-identified as Hispanic , the allure of rightwing proto-fascist politics comes from a complex and contradictory cocktail of misinformation within Latino communities, the presence of authoritarian influences from their countries of origin, and a proximity to whiteness in the US that relies more on dominance over people than one's skin color. In this world, violence is an apt political response to threats to such dominance.\n\n\"Part of what we're seeing - not just in the militia groups, but all across, including a clear upsurge of people of color voting Republican party - is that there's not a necessary connection between racial identity and your beliefs,\" Daniel HoSang , professor of ethnicity, race and migration and American studies at Yale University, says.\n\nHe added: \"It is complicated. It means disentangling your presumptions around race and political identity. We had an entire civil rights movement that was grounded on combating laws that were racially segregative. Now, we're at a moment where it's a bit more muddy and requires more nuance.\"\n\nGarcia, who was killed by police, wore a patch on his chest that read \"RWDS\", which stands for \"Right Wing Death Squad\", a nod to glorifying violence and an allusion popular among far-right and extremist groups to violence by Central and South American paramilitary groups against communists and what they saw enemies on the political left from as far back as the 1970s, the Associated Press reported .\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League found posts on Russian social media of Garcia with neo-Nazi tattoos and misogynist language, including those used by \" incels \", a subculture of men who blame women and society for their inability to form romantic connections, a phenomenon that federal law enforcement sees as a rising threat that could escalate to violence, often against women.\n\n\"White supremacy itself is not just about membership, about who is and isn't white,\" says HoSang, co-author of the 2019 book Producers, Parasites, Patriots: Race and the New Right-Wing Politics of Precarity. \"It comes with a politics and ideology of division ... It's also their beliefs about the nation and of the role of violence in enforcing that hierarchy.\"\n\nUnlike the white supremacists who rioted in Charlottesville in 2017, men of color attracted to white supremacist ideologies believe less in a white ethnostate and more that the state has failed them in the past and it will take violence to suppress threats and restore their perceived sense of order, HoSang says. Scholars have described their connection to these extremists as the \" multiracial far right \".\n\nCecilia Márquez, a history professor at Duke University, was less surprised than others when it was revealed the Texas mass shooter was Latino and had peddled white supremacist views. She has tracked the involvement of Latino people on the white nationalist website Stormfront, particularly since the killing of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman, whose mother was Peruvian .\n\nMárquez had seen a small but rising number of Latino men, and men of color broadly, being drawn into white nationalist forums and becoming radicalized. Márquez, whose research has found Latino participation in white supremacist groups as far back as the 1980s, described how Latinos on the website would identify as the heirs to the Spanish conquest in similar ways to how white supremacists would relate to Norse or Viking mythology.\n\nShe added that the internet \"made it possible for white supremacists throughout the Americas to be able to talk to each other\" in ways that were not possible before, noting that that communication through messaging apps like WhatsApp had \"accelerated\" not just the spread of misinformation but also of \"information designed to radicalize people\".\n\n\"It felt really, really scary,\" Márquez said. The Texas shooter, she added, was \"not a single actor. He's not by himself. He's part of a growing community of people who are engaged in this kind of thinking, and increasingly this kind of violence.\"\n\nShe emphasized, however, that Garcia's views represented a fraction of this small population and fixating on him missed the larger story of how Latinos in the US have largely consolidated around Democratic political views. Still, experts say, Garcia represents a paradox of squaring away one's racial identity with one's political identity.\n\nLike others, Cristina Beltrán, an associate professor who studies race and the right at New York University, emphasized that the experiences and views of Latino communities in the US are not monolithic, and being Latino is one part of a person's identity.\n\n\"We know that experience alone doesn't produce an identity. That is how you interpret your experiences,\" Beltrán says.\n\nWhat could also draw young men of color to the far right extends beyond perceived views of racial superiority. Beltrán argued that they could also be drawn to the practice of \"domination\" that is tied to American history and the subjugation of other groups such as women, noting that it was part of a \"history of being able to feel free because some groups are below you\".\n\nSign up to Headlines US\n\nGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nIn a Washington Post op-ed , Beltrán, author of Cruelty as Citizenship: How Migrant Suffering Sustains White Democracy, also wrote that the rise of Donald Trump offered this form of what she called \"multiracial whiteness\" to far-right men of color like Enrique Tarrio, an Afro-Cuban former leader of the Proud Boys who was recently found guilty of seditious conspiracy in relation to the January 6 insurrection. Márquez and Beltrán both questioned whether those views opened pathways for men of color into more extremist ideology.\n\nWhat's more, Beltrán argues that the expansion of jobs within the US security and carceral apparatus in the past few decades have both inspired movements to dismantle those systems and reinforced the perception of a nation under threat, as people from communities of color both fill those jobs and are disproportionately affected by the prison system .\n\nShe added that those communities have certain views on how to resolve problems and are skewed to conservatism.\n\n\"In Texas, you have a lot of migrants who are being brutalized by our really terrible immigration and border policy. But you also have over half of the border patrol being Latino,\" Beltrán says. \"They're employed and being socialized into a brutal regime that is very dehumanizing to migrants.\"\n\nWithin the histories of their countries of origin are moments of anti-Blackness and anti-Indigenous sentiment, as well as reactionary politics that led to the violent suppression of progressive views by dictators.\n\nBeltrán says that within Texas, where the shooting took place, Latinos, particularly people of Mexican descent, have a complicated history as both having a proximity to whiteness and being subjected to lynching and brutalization by the Texas rangers.\n\n\"Latinos have always existed as a population that's both been under assault, and also been brought into practices of racial domination,\" Beltrán says.\n\nIn Garcia, Márquez saw a difficult tension: Garcia's hate-filled views rest on the extreme end of a spectrum of conservatism that separates one's connection to their racial and ethnic identity and one's political views. She added that his hateful views, shared by an increasingly visible minority of people, were not representative but also should not be discounted.\n\nExperts have pointed to Latino Republicans who have touted their own identities on the campaign trails while they supported former president Donald Trump's anti-immigration policies.\n\n\"Maybe not everyone has a swastika on their body. But many of us have aunts and uncles who say inappropriate things at the table, or have someone who voted for Trump or doesn't want to live in communities with other people,\" Márquez says.\n\n\"Seeing [Garcia] as part of this spectrum is important. Yes, he is aberrant in so many ways - in so many ways. But to look away from him and eschew him from our community gets us off the hook because there is a lot of racism within the community and anti-Blackness and anti-Indigenous sentiment that we have to reckon with.\""

The data shows significant attachment to deep-seated and debunked myths about 'race'. More positively, the findings show that the public can understand systemic racism and that they can be rallied around far-reaching anti-racist solutions.\"\n\nThe researchers found the message with the most potential was when people in England were told Oxford University researchers had applied for more than 3,000 jobs in the names of fictitious applicants, randomly varying the ethnicity, but keeping the skills, qualifications and work experience the same. White British applicants had to make four applications to get a positive response while ethnic minority applicants had to make seven.\n\n\"It is an almost watertight piece of evidence about the existence of racism in hiring,\" the authors said. \"The experiment 'catches racism red-handed'. Naming Oxford University gives the results further credibility. And, additionally, the way that the fake CV 'sting' is outlined gives the message the feel of a compelling story - with plot, characters and a powerful ending.\"\n\nOther effective messages involved telling people about far worse maternal mortality rates for black women than faced by white women and even using a metaphor to describe racism as a birdcage which traps people all boosted public acceptance of racism as a problem.\n\nSign up to First Edition\n\nOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what's happening and why it matters\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nAn example of a message that made people less likely to think of racism as a systemic problem was one that said: \"This country's black and minority ethnic communities still suffer poorer outcomes across education, employment, health and in the criminal justice system .

      "text": "How women and minorities are claiming their right to rage\n\nWhy do many think it acceptable for the white judge Brett Kavanaugh to lose his cool in public, but not the black tennis champion Serena Williams?\n\nA nger is typically defined as a strong feeling of displeasure, hostility or aggression. Mainly, we think of it in terms of individual feelings, and we associate those feelings with isolating behaviours that cause discomfort or fear in ourselves or in others.\n\nAnger is, however, also a critically useful and positive emotion - one that is, contrary to being isolating, deeply social and socially constructed. Anger warns us, as humans, that something is wrong and needs to change. Anger is the human response to being threatened with indignity, physical harm, humiliation and unfairness. Anger drives us to demand accountability, a powerful force for political good. As such, it is often what drives us to form creative, joyous and politically vibrant communities.\n\nSo, which one is it? The answer depends, like most things, on context and on who you are in relation to the people around you. How we feel about feelings and respond to them in others depends on the way that our culture distributes emotion, often in relation to status and identity.\n\nAt the earliest stages of childhood socialisation, anger becomes firmly associated with masculinity and manhood. Studies show that by the time most children are toddlers they already associate angry expressions with male faces . \"Softer\" emotions, such as empathy, fear and sadness, are less emphasised and sometimes actively discouraged in boys. These are seen, by many, as feminising weaknesses, whereas anger is considered a marker of masculinity.\n\nGirls and women, on the other hand, are subtly encouraged to put anger and other \"negative\" emotions aside, as unfeminine. Studies show that girls are frequently discouraged from even recognising their own anger, from talking about negative feelings, or being demanding in ways that focus on their own needs.\n\nGirls are encouraged to smile more, use their \"nice\" voices and sublimate how they themselves may feel in deference to the comfort of others. Suppressed, repressed, diverted and ignored anger is now understood as a factor in many \"women's illnesses\", including various forms of disordered eating, autoimmune diseases, chronic fatigue and pain.\n\nAs we move from the intimacy and privacy of the home into institutions, this emotional gender divide compounds and is compounded by other forms of bias. In schools, for example, girls are expected to exert greater self-control, to be more polite, and not to use strong or obscene language. All of these also limit the expression and display of anger. Educators and psychologists studying these dynamics note that in girls, assertiveness, aggression and anger are often conflated so that girls who defend themselves, hold strong opinions and are competitive and verbally self-assured are frequently pegged by adults as rude, belligerent, confrontational and uncooperative. However, in boys, the same behaviours are often seen as signs of leadership, confidence and creative disruption.\n\nSocial and biased regulation of emotional expression also results in black and minority ethnic children being held to different and higher standards of behaviour. Black students are seen by adults as less innocent and in need of patience or care. Starting in pre-school, black boys are three times as likely to be disciplined as white boys. Black girls, however, held to both racial and gender expectations, are six times more likely than white girls to be suspended or expelled, disciplining that serves as the beginning, in the US, of a well-documented school-to-prison pipeline.\n\nHowever, within peer groups, by adulthood, anger is most commonly associated with power for and by men and with powerlessness for and by women. This is because anger in men confirms gender role beliefs and expectations, but anger in women confounds them. Anger in women is still considered a sign of mental or hormonal imbalance, whereas in men it is perceived as \"normal\" and associated with masculine control, leadership, authority and competence. The difference isn't truly one of gender, but of status. Black and minority ethnic men are often subject to the same biases as girls and women broadly, and black and minority women experience both indivisibly.\n\nMen who display anger at work, studies find, gain influence, whereas their female peers lose influence. A typical study, conducted in 2018 by the Center for WorkLife Law , asked lawyers if they were free to use anger at work when a case merits it and if they felt they were punished for displaying aggression. White men felt much freer to express anger at work than any other group, including minority men. While 40% of minority women and 44% of white women said they were free to express anger, 56% percent of white men said the same. An even higher percentage of white men, 62%, said they were not penalised for anger or aggression, compared with fewer than half of all women, with scant racial differences. Disparities like these affect women and minority men in professional and political life. In the law and elsewhere, emotional expression can be an essential factor of success.\n\nIn politics, the bind is treacherous. The double standard became a running joke during Barack Obama's presidency after Comedy Central's Key & Peele featured a character named Luther who stood behind an Obama doppelganger translating calm and measured Obama statements into outbursts of unbridled rage. The routine was comedic gold, but, in fact, the issue is a profoundly serious one. Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders could express and display anger as political conviction, leveraging populist rage in a way that minority and women candidates cannot. The need women feel to appear reasonable, calm and competent often leaves them open to criticism that they are \"inauthentic\", \"not charismatic\", and amorphously \"less likable\".\n\nThese regulations of anger are a powerful way to enforce inequality and buttress status quo hierarchies. White masculinity has been tied, often through the freer use of anger, to notions of citizenship and the responsibilities of adult manhood: providing, protecting and holding power. Anger's entanglement with masculinity, to asset power or control, is a patriarchal entitlement routinely denied to subaltern men who, on the basis of race, ethnicity or class, are effectively \"feminised\" as a way to oppress them. Sometimes that feminisation comes from limiting opportunities to work, to vote, to protect or to lead. Other times, it comes from punishing anger as a means of seeking dignity, fairness or self-defence.\n\nSeveral recent public incidents provide striking illustrations of these dynamics.\n\nAggrieved and entitled anger is now practically synonymous with the US supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh's name. Kavanaugh's overwrought and viscerally angry performance during his confirmation hearing is now the stuff of legend. His indignation at having to answer to Christine Blasey Ford's assertion that he had sexually assaulted her as a teenager left him red-faced and sputtering, in marked contrast to Blasey Ford's studied, calm and almost deferential mien. Kavanaugh's anger was not weaponised against him, but rather, despite his behaviour clearly contradicting the notion of judicial equanimity, was understood by his supporters as righteous masculine self-defence in the face of insult and threat.\n\nPublic acceptance for men's angry behaviours and, conversely, penalty for women's, even tilts into material compensation. Only weeks before the Kavanaugh hearings, the tennis superstar Serena Williams angrily confronted the chair umpire Carlos Ramos during the US Open final. Williams was angry but was also, in fact, self-aware and measured in her critique of the umpire, who failed to de-escalate the exchange.\n\nAs many commentators made clear, male players, who happen to be almost all white, have been glorified as charismatic, passionate \"bad boys\", rewarded with magazine covers, corporate sponsorships and highly paid media roles. For her efforts, Williams was given the highest ever fine for \"verbal abuse\" in the history of the US Open. She was penalised for language far less profane than male champions have ever used.\n\nSport often puts these double standards regarding the uses and abuses of anger and aggression into sharp relief. The American football star Colin Kaepernick famously encouraged NFL players to \"take a knee\" during the national anthem in protest against police brutality. His action, peaceful, measured and respectful, catalysed rage-filled screeds against him, Black Lives Matter and the movement to end police brutality. He continues to be reviled as unpatriotic and castigated for\"ruining\" the sport by \"politicising it\", as though it is not already a radically politicised cultural phenomenon.\n\nAfter Kaepernick opted out of one NFL contract in search of another, he was left unsigned, undoubtedly a direct result of being blackballed. While open public anger was one outcome of Kaepernick's activism it was not, despite how he himself may have felt about the brutalisation of black bodies, how he chose to, or could most effectively, express himself in a fight involving overlapping white male fraternities - the NFL, the Fraternal Order of Police, the US president and the criminal justice system - all of which have historically held powerful monopolies on people's bodies, the law, regulated violence, material resources ... and righteous rage.\n\n\"Black men expressing rage in public has the potential of getting them shot and killed by police,\" explained the journalist Joshua Adams in a 2018 post-Kavanaugh-tantrum article on Medium. Black men, he continued, \"can't afford any illusions about how the world views black masculinity. Knowing how angry society sees you, forcing yourself into the proper comportment is a calculation many black men have all too much experience with.\"\n\nAgain, context, relationships and status matter, however. Identity, like emotion, is complex and complicating. Consider, as an example, the R&B singer R Kelly's explosive behaviour during an interview in March with the journalist Gayle King. The interview was the first since Kelly was officially charged with the sexual abuse of four women, three of whom were between the ages of 13 and 17 when their alleged attacks took place. During the interview, King sat calmly and almost completely still as Kelly stood, paced, ranted, yelled into a camera, and even pounded his chest. A viral photo of their exchange, which took place in a studio decorated like a living room, looked like a searing portrait of intimate violence. Kelly's behaviour could not be separated from the fact that King, a woman, was his interviewer. In 2015, he stood over and shouted at the journalist Caroline Modarressy-Tehrani, as she questioned him about the same allegations. It is almost inconceivable he would have acted in this way if his interviewers had been men.\n\nGender is a defining element, but it is also a dimension of the complex fabric of context, status, and social understanding. During the past several years - marked by widespread technological, social and political disruption and tumult - rage has been a defining aspect of our culture. Women have been more openly and actively expressing anger, an allowance that typically coincides with social unrest and then, typically, subsides with stability.\n\nToday, we see girls and women at the forefront of movements fighting for climate change and resisting authoritarianism. They are demanding an end to institutional tolerance of corruption, sexual violence and discrimination. They are, significantly, taking the risks that come with the open, public and political claim to anger.\n\nWhether or not their anger and activism will be publicly and politically respected and rewarded has yet to be determined.\n\nSoraya Chemaly is the author of Rage Becomes Her: The Power of Women's Anger, published by Simon & Schuster at £16.99"

People from most minority ethnic groups are more likely to live in deprived neighbourhoods and highly populated dense places than the white British population, with socioeconomic poverty being a key factor that influences health.\n\nThe analysis also shows that, after adjusting for factors such as sex, age and health needs, the number of general practitioners per patient is 13% lower in the most deprived parts of England than in the most affluent areas. It is also 16% lower in the most populated dense areas of the country than the least densely populated areas.\n\nExperts have said that the stark disparity of numbers of GPs across different local authorities is because the Carr-Hill formula, which is used to determine how much money per patient is allocated to each GP practice, does not adequately account for how factors such as deprivation and ethnicity may affect the health outcomes of an area.\n\nJake Beech, a policy fellow at the Health Foundation, said the formula did not \"properly compensate practices for the additional health need associated with deprivation, skewing funding towards more affluent areas.\n\n\"People living in [deprived] areas often have higher health needs, and our research shows that after accounting for these higher needs, GP practices in more deprived areas are under-doctored and underfunded compared to more affluent ones,\" Beech said.\n\n\"The main driver of this is the formula used to allocate funding to GP surgeries. The formula has been in place for over 20 years, and despite numerous promises to change it this hasn't yet happened. Policymakers need to distribute funding and staff in general practice more equitably, so that resources are better matched to need.\"\n\nBeccy Baird, a senior fellow in health policy at the King's Fund thinktank, said it was \"widely recognised\" that the Carr-Hill formula \"doesn't adequately reflect the extra costs associated with deprivation\".\n\nSign up to First Edition\n\nOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what's happening and why it matters\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nShe added: \"It is also harder for GP practices in deprived areas to meet the quality targets which they need to meet to receive additional funding (known as QOF), such as how well patients are controlling their diabetes, because their patients may need more support than those in wealthier areas. This means that practices in more deprived areas may not be able to afford as many staff as they need to meet the needs of their patients.\"\n\nThe analysis also shows that inequality is at its highest level in London. The number of GPs per patient is a quarter lower in the areas of the capital with the greatest proportion of ethnic minorities compared with those where the lowest proportion of people from minority ethnic backgrounds live.\n\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"We are committed to eliminating health disparities across the nation so everyone can live longer, healthier lives and we have always prioritised the NHS by backing it with the funding it needs.\n\n\"We are dedicated to improving access to GPs, and we are now delivering 50m more GP appointments per year compared to 2019.\n\n\"The most recent data shows GP funding increased in real terms by 19% between 2017-18 and 2021-22, and our primary care recovery plan is investing up to £645m to expand pharmaceutical services and take pressure off general practice.\"\n\nThe alternative manifesto: Securing the future of the NHS\n\nOn Tuesday 27 February, 8pm-9.15pm GMT, join Denis Campbell, Narda Ahmed, Siva Anandaciva and Greg Fell as they discuss what an alternative manifesto for health and social care could be.

      "text": "Working class versus minorities? That's looking at it the wrong way\n\nO fficials eyeing you with contempt. Police treating you as scum. A sense of being constantly watched and judged by professionals. Living in fear of benefit sanctions. A lack of community facilities. Such is likely to be your experience if you are working class. Such is also likely to be your experience if you are of black or minority ethnic origin.\n\nBut here's the odd thing: people from the working class and minorities are rarely seen as facing the same kinds of issues. Instead, in political debates from Brexit to welfare benefits, minorities and the working class are seen as having conflicting interests and often set against each other. We are Ghosts: Race, Class and Institutional Prejudice , a report published last week by the thinktanks Class and the Runnymede Trust, attempts to address this. Based on interviews and focus groups, almost entirely in\n\nLondon, the sample may not be statistically valid but subjective experiences\n\nof the interviewees are revealing.\n\nFor many people on low incomes, whether white or of minority background, encounters with the state - police, local council, social services, jobcentres - are experienced as punitive and disempowering; a sense of being policed rather than supported. As one interviewee put it: \"You just feel like you're constantly being watched, and you're always being judged by what you're doing or what you're saying, but I just don't feel that there's a lot of support.\"\n\nFor minority groups, this has been compounded by \" hostile environment \" migration policies that effectively turn doctors, teachers and public officials into border guards and spies. Many feel priced out of the neighbourhoods in which they grew up, observing how a combination of gentrification and austerity has helped shut down community organisations and the social networks that sustained them.\n\nBut while experiences are often shared, the sense of being bound together in a common class rarely is. What it means to be working class has become blurred. Work was always the anchor for working-class identity. But the character of work has changed enormously. Traditional industrial workers now make up less than a third of the working class. Four out of 10 of these workers are in the service industry, while 30% form the \" precariat \" - lacking security, often shifting from one short-term job to another. Today's working class is more precarious, less organised and comprises more women, migrants and minorities - and is less conscious of itself as a working class. In a fragmented labour market in which unions have lost much of their power, there are fewer opportunities to share physical space, build a collective sense of identity or create a common ground for mobilisation.\n\nWhite people are far more likely to identify as working class than those from minorities. Partly this may be because minorities are more likely to be in casualised jobs. Many, the report suggests, may also have internalised anti-working class sentiments. \"When you say working class,\" observed a black interviewee, \"you think of people on council estates, drinking that cheap Ace cider.\" And then there's a question the report does not address: the impact of identity categories on self-perception. Minorities have come to be identified, and to identify themselves, in terms of race, ethnicity or \"community\". Class categories, these days, are applied primarily to the white population. Class distinctions have become racialised - few now question the use of the term \"white working class\". Meanwhile, class divisions within minority groups are often ignored.\n\nConsider for instance, another report published last week, an Office for National Statistics (ONS) study of the \" ethnic pay gap \". It showed that those of Chinese and Indian origin have a higher median hourly pay than white British people. Bangladeshi, Pakistani and black people have lower pay, with Bangladeshi people doing worst.\n\nThe differences are not simply ethnic. Age matters. Among Bangladeshi people, for instance, those over 30 earn 27.9% less than white Britons, while for those aged 16 to 30 the difference is just 3.1%. What of class? Indian people and Chinese migrants to Britain tend to be more middle class than African Caribbean, Pakistani and Bangladeshi people. Studies have shown that class structure of minority groups plays an important role in employment prospects but also that racial disparities persist even when class differences are taken into account.\n\nUnfortunately, the ONS study does not look at the issue of class. Hence, for all the debate about the study, the significance of the ethnic pay gap is not easy to pin down. Race and class shape people's lives in complex, sometimes contradictory, ways. What these reports reveal is that too often we stress the wrong differences and ignore the commonalities that matter.\n\nKenan Malik is an Observer columnist\n\nThis is the archive of The Observer up until 21/04/2025.

      "text": "So the term BAME has had its day. But what should replace it?\n\nThe truth is, there'll never be a handy acronym that can capture the complex histories and cultures of Britain's ethnic minorities\n\nP ublication of the report from Boris Johnson's Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities should have been a landmark moment in the UK's conversation about race. In the wake of last summer's Black Lives Matter protests, it seemed as though the government might finally acknowledge the impact of institutional racism in creating disparities in healthcare , education and criminal justice .\n\nExcept it didn't. The report took a self-congratulatory tone, noting that Britain's success in removing race-based disparities in education and the economy \"should be regarded as a model for other white-majority countries\". With few actual problems to address then, the commission's headline proposal concerned scrapping the \"unhelpful\" term BAME.\n\nWhile many, including Halima Begum, chief executive of the Runnymede Trust, were rightly dismissive of the token move - \"Britain's ethnic minority communities are being insulted by this report,\" said Begum - the proposal reflects the long-held sentiment that we need a new language for talking about race .\n\nWords matter, and they especially matter when it comes to identity. Britain's ethnic minority communities have had a number of labels since migration from the \"new commonwealth\" really kicked off in the 1950s and 60s. Then, immigrants from British colonies in Africa, the Caribbean and south Asia were generally given the umbrella term \"coloureds\".\n\nThe shared experience of racial discrimination in post-colonial Britain made cross-community solidarity both possible and necessary, and by the late 1970s, the movement for racial equality in Britain had widely adopted an inclusive definition of \"black\" that encompassed people of both African and South Asian heritage.\n\nBy the early 1990s, however, the size and composition of Britain's ethnic minority community had changed enough to make continued use of the word black as a catch-all unworkable. In 1994, the sociologist Tariq Modood published Political Blackness and British Asians , in which he argued that the already waning term harmed Asians by suggesting a \"false essentialism: that all non-white groups have something in common other than how others treat them\".\n\nBy the late 1990s, political blackness had been largely discarded in favour of more specific definitions that conflated the national, continental, ethnic and racial - the 2001 census included separate categories for \"Mixed\", \"Black\", \"Asian\" and \"Chinese or Other\". The extent to which Modood's case against \"black\" resembles the arguments given for scrapping BAME is striking, with the authors of the race report suggesting that the blanket term fails to adequately reflect the experiences of different ethnic communities.\n\nAs with \"black\", BAME's critics are right to highlight the term's shortcomings - it feels wonky and contrived while implying that all ethnic minorities are part of a homogeneous group. Moreover, it has never really sat well with ethnic minorities themselves . Indeed, BAME has been a particularly unsuccessful candidate for widespread adoption. According to Google Trends, searches for \"BAME\" shot up in April 2020 - probably because of its frequent usage in reporting Covid health disparities. The fact that it's already on the scrapheap shows the term was never really fit for purpose.\n\nWith BAME unloved and on the way out, the question now is what should replace it, exactly?\n\nWell, the search is under way. Last week, the thinktank British Future published a blogpost ( Beyond BAME ) looking at how people might like to be referred to instead. Its research found that most ethnic minority Britons slightly prefer \"ethnic minority\" as an umbrella term, with two-thirds (68%) saying they either support or accept the term and only 13% opposed.\n\nWhile ethnic minority is probably a step in the right direction (it has the advantage over BAME of using real words), we can't expect a consensus around a single term. This must be kept in mind while thinking about the alternatives - a list that includes but is not limited to \"people of colour\" (too American and has the potential to be confused with \"coloured people\"), \"non-white\" (too negative - no one will identify with the state of being not white), and even BIPOC (like BAME but longer, and what does the \"I\" - meaning indigenous - refer to in a British context?).\n\nBAME is not inherently problematic, there's just an inherent problem in a catch-all given the complexity of how we categorise race. As Angela Saini , author of Superior: the Return of Race Science , explains, race is a social construct, and therefore the words we use to talk about it reflect a specific socio-cultural context. For instance, \"Asian\" in the US and UK generally refer to distinct ethnic communities from east and south Asia respectively.\n\nBAME, like \"black\" and \"coloured' before it, was doomed to fail because it's impossible to distill centuries of history and culture into a handy acronym. Consequently, names will continue to be picked up and discarded as long as the shape and composition of Britain's BAME community continues to evolve.\n\nYes, words do matter, and it's genuinely important that offensive or unintelligible terms aren't used by companies and public bodies - but when it comes to categorising Britain's ethnic minorities, an elegant solution will not be found because an elegant solution does not exist. The point is to not get too bogged down in finding a terminology that perfectly captures one's identity, but to identify the ways in which people, by virtue of their race or citizenship or ethnicity, are put at systemic disadvantage in Britain - and fixing these injustices.\n\nAlex Mistlin is a Guardian Scott Trust bursary journalist"

But for people from ethnic minority backgrounds, the figure rises to one in three, according to analysis of the NHS cancer patient experience 2022 survey by QualityWatch, a joint programme from the Nuffield Trust and the Health Foundation.\n\nFor young people aged between 16 and 24, about half needed at least three GP visits before being diagnosed, with 20% needing at least five visits. Despite this, young people were still more likely to be diagnosed at an early stage in their cancer.\n\nThe analysis also found that people from the most deprived areas in England were 21% less likely to be referred for urgent suspected cancer than those from more affluent areas.\n\nThe NHS's own target is to have three-quarters of cancers diagnosed at an early stage by 2028.\n\nThe research further reveals the disparities in cancer care between demographics across England. Deprivation already causes an extra 33,000 cancer deaths across the UK , while black and Asian people on average wait longer for a cancer diagnosis than their white counterparts.\n\nProf Kamila Hawthorne, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, said that identifying cancer symptoms in young people could be challenging as the risk for the group was generally much smaller.\n\nHawthorne said: \"Ensuring patients receive timely and appropriate referrals for suspected cancers is a priority for GPs - and to this end, they are doing a good job, making more urgent referrals and ensuring more cancers are being diagnosed at an early stage than ever.\n\n\"Whilst GPs are highly trained to identify cancers, this remains challenging in primary care, not least and particularly with some cancers, because the symptoms are often vague and typical of other, more common conditions.\"\n\nDr Liz Fisher, senior fellow at the Nuffield Trust, said: \"Delays to a cancer diagnosis pose real risks for people and an early diagnosis plays a pivotal role in determining the treatments available to people and determining outcomes.\n\n\"The NHS has set an ambitious goal to dramatically increase early detection of cancer, but performance in this area has stubbornly stalled in recent years. Everyone's experience of cancer diagnosis is different but the risks to delays aren't felt equally, with younger people and those from minority ethnic groups requiring more visits to health professionals to secure a diagnosis.\"\n\nTim Gardner, the assistant director of policy for the Health Foundation, said: \"This analysis highlights the need to improve people's access to primary care, especially in more deprived areas, so that more people can be diagnosed earlier. This ultimately depends on boosting primary care capacity through sustainable, long-term investment and growing and supporting the workforce.\"\n\nAn NHS spokesperson said: \"NHS staff are working hard to ensure that everyone affected by cancer receives a prompt diagnosis, regardless of their age, ethnicity or socioeconomic status.\n\n\"The NHS is diagnosing more people than ever for cancers at an early stage and, for the first time, over 3 million people were referred by GPs for potentially life-saving cancer checks last year.\""

      "text": "Police watchdog: ethnic minorities need protection from unfair stop and search\n\nIOPC condemns stops based on 'stereotypes and racial bias' and cites case of  teenager reportedly stopped 60 times\n\nPolice abuse of their stop and search powers is so serious that black people need \"protecting\" from stereotyping and racial biases, the police watchdog said, as it revealed allegations one child was stopped 60 times.\n\nThe Guardian understands the force concerned was the Metropolitan police which is alleged to have stopped the teenager so often he was left traumatised. He was sometimes searched multiple times in the same day over two years, starting in 2018 when he was aged 14.\n\nThe claims, which are still under investigation, were revealed by the Independent Office for Police Conduct in a special review which made 18 recommendations for police across England and Wales to radically reform use of the controversial power.\n\nThe IOPC said misuse of stop and search was causing \"trauma\" and damaging confidence in policing despite repeated police promises of reform.\n\nIt cited cases where innocent black youngsters had been hit and had force used against them, and people being handcuffed within seconds of police stopping them.\n\nStop and search is the continued flashpoint of police and community relations, especially with black people.\n\nHome Office figures show that black people are seven times more likely to be stopped across England and Wales, with the vast majority of stops leading to no further action.\n\nStops require reasonable suspicion, and the IOPC criticised the use of weak grounds such as \"looking nervous\" and unspecific intelligence such as someone being in \"a high crime area\".\n\nSal Naseem, from the IOPC, told the Guardian: \"In the evidence we have got, we do see examples of racial bias and stereotyping influencing the decisions officers are making.\"\n\nHe added the problems \"go beyond a few officers\", and said: \"Stop and search is a legitimate tool. It needs to be used with more care and currently is being used too bluntly.\"\n\nThe two most important recommendations from the IOPC are that plans are drawn up to protect communities from the misuse of stop and search.\n\nThe watchdog said police chiefs and the College of Policing, which sets professional standards, should \"develop guidelines on how to safeguard people from a black, Asian or other minority ethnic background from being stopped and searched because of decision-making based upon assumptions, stereotypes and racial bias, and mitigate the risks of indirect discrimination\".\n\nThe IOPC also said that policing should order research into the \"trauma caused predominantly to people from a black, Asian and other minority ethnic background, including children and young people, by the use of stop and search\".\n\nStop and search rose by 24% to 695,009 in the year ending March 2021, according to Home Office figures, fuelled by increased searches for drugs, which rose by 36% to 478,576 compared with the previous year. Seventy-seven per cent of stops had a recorded outcome of \"no further action\".\n\nNaseem said handcuffing during stops was used too routinely, and the report cited statistics showing a potential racial bias, adding: \"Experimental statistics published by the Home Office covering 2019-20 indicate that black people were about 5.7 times more likely to have force used on them than white people across all tactics. Additionally, black people were eight times more likely to be 'compliant handcuffed'.\"\n\nThe IOPC said officers could see wholly innocent actions as grounds for suspicion and cited the case of a \"black child riding a bicycle near to a pedestrian during Covid-19 lockdown restrictions\" who was suspected of being involved in a drugs deal.\n\nIn another case two brothers were searched after a fist bump was mistaken for a drug deal.\n\nAmanda Pearson, who leads for police chiefs on stop and search, said: \"Stop and search, even when done with respect and courtesy, is intrusive and has an impact on people. We recognise that the level of disproportionality in a tactic like stop and search is continuing to damage relations with people from black, Asian and other ethnic minority backgrounds.\n\n\"It is our responsibility to ensure that we balance tackling crime with building trust and confidence in our communities, and we haven't always got that balance right with stop and search.\"\n\nThe Met uses stop and search much more frequently than any other force and said last year 4,800 offensive weapons seized through stop and search alone."

      "text": "Why are so many prisoners from ethnic minorities? I intend to find out\n\nMy independent review aims to examine suggestions of systematic racial bias in the British justice system\n\nW here America leads, Britain usually follows. Art and culture, film and fashion, language and political ideas all have a habit of crossing the Atlantic. But in one important area of British life we must resist this trend: the incarceration rates for ethnic minorities.\n\nAmerica is home to almost 25% of the world's prisoners , but not even 5% of the world's population . Minorities make up a disproportionate share: about one in every 15 African American men are incarcerated , alongside one in 36 Latino males. The figure for white men is one in 106.\n\nThe numbers have shock value, but in Britain we have our own problems. Black people here are almost four times more likely than white people to be behind bars. Similarly, the number of Muslim prisoners has nearly doubled in the last decade. We have not reached US levels yet, but these are problems that must be confronted.\n\nWhen the prime minister asked me to conduct an independent review into this issue I accepted with little hesitation. I have had to put to one side day-to-day party differences because the review is a rare chance to forge a cross-party consensus on an issue that is complex, contested and divisive. It is also a chance to hear voices from beyond Westminster and Whitehall, from judges to community groups; prison officers to offenders themselves.\n\nThe first challenge is to unpick the facts. It is the case, for example, that offenders from minority backgrounds are more likely to face prison sentences than white offenders for the same offences. The odds are 39% greater, in fact, according to recent analysis.\n\nMany will attribute this to old-fashioned discrimination, and that is certainly what black and Muslim offenders were keen to convey to me on a visit to Pentonville prison a few weeks ago. One Muslim prisoner, who was from Yorkshire and had been sentenced at York crown court, put it quite plainly: \"My solicitor was white, my barrister was white, the prosecutor was white, the judge was white, the jury was white, and when I first went to prison the governor was white and so were all the guards.\"\n\nIf his experience and viewpoint are representative of many, we have a serious problem. Looking at the diversity of staff in our justice system will be one aspect of the review. Ultimately, any justice system must be founded on trust, fairness and equality before the law, irrespective of ethnicity, social class or background.\n\nAnother way forward may be the emerging body of work around \"implicit bias\" . Evidence from this field shows how we can all exhibit biases in our behaviour without even being aware of them. Experiments show CVs with \"white-sounding\" names being treated more favourably than those with names linked to minority backgrounds, for example.\n\nOthers will want to interrogate these figures about the justice system further. It appears to be the case, for example, that defendants from minority backgrounds are less likely to plead guilty and benefit from reduced sentences through plea bargains. Perhaps this explains the greater likelihood of going to prison.\n\nHowever, often one answer poses another question; if minorities plead \"not guilty\" more often than average, why is this the case? Are defendants from minority backgrounds receiving inferior legal advice? Or is it because they do not trust the system to deliver on its promises? Is there another explanation altogether for minorities making different choices in similar situations?\n\nThe point is that too often we don't know the answer. Many have strong hunches, but a consensus can only be achieved through hard facts and rigorous analysis. Over the course of the next year my review will provide that, starting with an open call to evidence from anyone who wants to contribute. There will be a formal process for people to get involved through the gov.uk website, alongside opportunities for people to connect and debate the issues on social media.\n\nI will examine whether the system treats people fairly - as well as what more can be done to help offenders from minority backgrounds turn their lives around. That means understanding if prisoners from particular backgrounds are more likely to get stuck in cycles of reoffending - and what more can be done about it. When half of all crime is committed by people who have already been through the criminal justice system - costing up to £13bn per year - we need answers to these questions.\n\nIn the US this problem is being tackled with a growing urgency. Last year, America's crime rate and incarceration rate both fell for the first time in four decades . We need to share that vision. My job in leading this review for England and Wales is to take action before things get that bad, and put our country on a path to different future."

      "text": "Are Women \"Minorities\"?\n\nPrincipal, DifferenceWORKS, LLC. which helps leaders leverage the diversity of today's workforce.\n\nI heard a great report on a morning news show recently - that at least 150 CEO's in the U.S. have publically committed to diversity and inclusion. One of the anchorwomen asked the CEO of PricewaterhouseCoopers, who represented the movement, if their targets or goals include women. She quickly added, \"Women are half the population.\" Was she suggesting that women should not be included in a diversity initiative because they aren't \"minorities\"? That seems to me like an archaic (and irritating) notion.\n\nThe term \"minority\" literally means \"fewer in number.\" Dictionary definitions, however, include another notion: of being different from the social majority and subordinate to a dominate group. Being a \"minority\" is not about numbers. It is about social power. A group that outnumbers the \"majority\" but lacks power is a \"minority.\"\n\nThere are a number of projections that whites will be a \"minority\" in the U.S. within a few decades. Whites will become a smaller percentage of the total population at some point. But whites will surely retain greater social power for much longer.\n\nBased on census data, women are, indeed, 50.8% of the U.S. population. While they represent a plurality of Americans, women rank below men in \"social power.\" Women in business (my usual focus) represent a smaller percentage at each rung of the corporate ladder. Catalyst's most recent report shows how the numbers drop. In the S&P 500, women are about 44% of total employees, 36% of mid-level managers, 25% of senior level executives, 9.5% of top earners and 5.8% of CEO's (and just under 20% of corporate board members). Women continue to earn less than men for the same work and overall. Women, particularly single women, are more likely to be poor. According to the National Women's Law Center, \"more than one in eight women and more than one in three single-mother families are poor.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

Women exist in slightly greater numbers than men. Yet white males have demonstrably more social power. Why? Because white males have both white privilege and male privilege . Privilege means being less likely to be subject to bias, prejudice and discrimination in the same way as are other people or groups. It can mean being able to live happily and not even see privilege - or its counterpart, bias. It means being able to deny the existence of privilege when you are a poor white male - one whose race and gender didn't open the magic gates.\n\nSo, yes, women should be included in diversity and inclusion initiatives. Until women are proportionally represented in business leadership and high office, the pay gap is closed, and poverty doesn't have a woman's face, women will be \"minorities.\" Until racial bias doesn't exist, people of color will be minorities. Initiatives to level the playing field should start with the acknowledgement of privilege and bias.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Many of us have faced threats to the very core of our identities and beliefs, compounding the pain of this moment even more.\n\nAnd now, the man who lobbied all of those threats against us is set to hold the highest office in the developed world.\n\nAs a queer person who left the American South four years ago to escape the kind of bigotry that laid the foundation for Trump to ascend to the presidency, I am utterly terrified.\n\nI'm terrified for my fellow LGBTQ brothers, sisters and siblings, who now face the prospect of the most anti-LGBTQ platform in the Republican party's history. What does it mean that conversion therapy is literally a part of the platform ? What does it mean that the vehemently anti-queer Mike Pence now holds the vice presidency? Will the Supreme Court overturn marriage equality ? What's going to happen to us?\n\nI'm terrified for the people of color in this country who just endured the most blatantly racist presidential campaign in recent memory, on top of the daily horrors and struggles of being a POC in this country. What does this mean for the future of racial minorities in America? Our new president is blatantly out of touch with the needs of the most vulnerable members of our population. What does it mean to have a man endorsed by the KKK win this race in 2016? What kind of message are young kids of color receiving about the world they will come of age in?\n\nI fear for immigrants, for the people who have been the primary targets of Trump's xenophobic comments throughout the course of this campaign. Will Trump actually ban Muslims from entering the United States? Will he build the wall along the Mexican border? Will white nationalism continue to rise ?\n\nAnd I'm terrified for the women in my life who, once again, are receiving the message that men can say and do whatever they want to women and their bodies without consequence . In fact, there are no limits to what these men can achieve in the Western world even if they wear their misogyny like a badge of honor ― including becoming president. What message does this send to young women about agency they have over their bodies? About what they can achieve in this world in the face of the patriarchy?

      "text": "Minorities: Should We Make Space For Those Who Excluded Us?\n\nStudent at Cornell University\n\nThe other day as I was riding home on the city bus, I couldn't help but to overhear a conversation happening behind me. It was two white individuals, one boy and one girl. She was complaining to her counterpart about the shit-show of her living circumstances ― she had just moved into a new place with less than a month left in the semester, she had to pay to have all of her belongings moved, and the university had charged her for terminating her on-campus housing contract.\n\nWhen the boy asked why she had even gone through with the move in the first place, her response began with something along the lines of, \"I just had to leave. I didn't feel comfortable there.\"\n\nMy ears immediately perked up―I had a hunch concerning where she was talking about. While I told myself I shouldn't make assumptions, her further comments proved my suspicions to be correct; she was referring to a themed residence housing that proclaims itself as a place that \"celebrates the rich and diverse history of Black people\".\n\nFrom what she was saying, she just didn't \"fit in\", and had a hard time making friends. She also was put off by the programs they hosted; they were held \"specifically for minorities\"―which is \"great\", she made sure to reiterate―but she felt, how can she feel comfortable attending such events that essentially outwardly excluded her? (12/04/16 Edit: The dorm actually does not bar non-minorities from attending their programs, and extent invitations for all members of the greater community to partake in their events.)\n\nNow, it's very easy to dismiss the girl's complaints to \"white tears\"―a term used to refer to undue woes expressed by whites. And I won't defend her entirely, because to some extent, it is. I mean, poor white girl who is used to being in the majority and feeling represented and being surrounded by people who look (and think) just like herself, right? Perhaps she forgot that those very circumstances that made her feel so unwelcome are the same ones that simply make up the reality called life for over one-third of our nation's population.\n\nBut at the same time, I wanted to hear her out, and empathize with her. Because my freshman year, I lived in that same dorm, and despite being of the same skin color as many of the occupants, I too felt out of place. But even more than that, I thought it was unfortunate that she shied away from the programs, since they tend to be very raw and informative, and would probably provide her with insight concerning the struggles of being black in America.\n\nIf they had not gotten off at the stop before mine, I surely would have engaged in conversation with her. Because what she was saying got me thinking―should we start making room for the privileged white groups that caused the inception of such spaces in the first place?\n\nThis exemplifies what they'd be doing-stepping out of their comfortable lit public spaces, and venturing into unknown (and potentially uncomfortable) spaces.\n\nI can imagine a response to my question that could be given: \"Those spaces are not meant for her to feel comfortable. If she wants to be comfortable, she can stay in the public space that marginalized and refused to accept us. This space is our space, and if she doesn't like it she can easily exit.\"\n\nAnd don't get me wrong―this is a very valid point.\n\nBut to me, something about that mindset rings amiss. Never mind that we are doing the same thing to them that they did to us (I personally don't think reciprocating negative actions is the answer to any issue―and perhaps FLOTUS Michelle Obama would agree). What needs to be considered is how such thinking can result in a stalemate for progress―because it excludes a vital counterpart needed to propelling us towards the institutional and social changes we strive for.\n\nIt's a bitter truth that we may not want to look at, but must be acknowledged: change doesn't happen without participation of the majority group. We can have our MLK, our Rosa Parks, our Malcom X―who are all vital and necessary figures―but without our Lyndon B. Johnson (and not to forget JFK, who advocated for a civil rights bill before his assassination), we don't get our legislative change. Similarly, we can create opportunities for those of us experiencing the same societal and structural injustices to gather and talk about it, but until we invite the group in power into our conversations to hear and understand them, we can never recruit them as allies and thus exclude ourselves from moving toward grander, wide-sweeping improvements to our condition.\n\nFurther, without inviting the privileged group into our spaces, it is likely easy for them to not even be aware that there is a problem. It's like planning an intervention, and not inviting the person with the substance habit―it doesn't make the source of the problem acknowledge that there is indeed a problem . Yeah, they may hear that meth is bad for their health, but until being made to accept the identification as a meth addict and exposed to the implications of their habit, there are no merits for change. Similarly, while whites may hear of social inequalities, there is likely a disconnect since they feel that, a.) They feel that hey are not affected by it, so it either does not exist or is not \"as big of a deal\" as everyone says it is, and b.) They do not personally discriminate, so they are not part of the problem (besides, didn't you see the safety pins on their shirts?). Including the majority group provides to opportunity to change their understanding―to let them know that racism is systematic ; to tell them that they are affected by social injustices, that they just get the much longer end of the stick; and to encourage them to find ways in their own life to raise awareness in their communities and take a stand against the injustices inflicted on people solely because of the color of their skin.\n\nAs Gunnar Myrdal states in his book The American Dilemma , the issues faced by the black communities in the nation are \"moral issues[s] both to Negros and the whites in America\". Besides the outdated terminology, this is a concept that applies to all non-white minority groups of the United States, and needs to be emphasized more. So let's release ourselves of all the burden, and shift some responsibility to the group historically responsible for our woes in the first place. And this, I believe, starts with opening up our spaces to them.\n\nI don't want to underscore another aspect of the problem: how whites do tend to avoid such spaces in which they become the minority (because who wants to be that ?) Because it is a problem, and probably an aspect that chased the girl I mentioned earlier away from the themed living community. But as a member of a colored minority group, I also know very well how we can be very exclusive―even amongst ourselves. That's why I'm advocating more white inclusiveness in our spaces. Since racial injustices impact all Americans, it's important to include whites in our spaces and our conversations. It's only through these means that we can gain an understanding of their perspectives, as well as provide them with a nuanced insight on our condition, and recruit whites in fighting for causes towards institutional and social equality for all Americans.\n\nMartin Luther King, Jr. meeting with whites in power to recruit them to fight for his agenda.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Civil Rights Aren't Just For Minorities - They're For Everyone\n\nHusband, father, teacher, education advocate\n\nIt's still shocking to me that so many white people seem to think civil rights are just a Black issue, as if they're things that only concerns people of color.\n\nWhite people can't be the victims of discrimination? We can't be mistreated on the basis of gender, religion, sexuality, or age?\n\nOf course we can! And many of us are. But we are rarely discriminated against on the basis of our race . And somehow accepting that fact seems to turn us against the very idea of civil rights.\n\nWe act as if talking about civil rights is code for Black issues. Many of us refuse to even admit that Black people have legitimate grievances in this area, that they're just needlessly complaining and looking for sympathy, that they're trying to get something for free or get one over on us.\n\nIt's pure bullshit. Black people are authentically aggrieved. They are the victims of a systemic racism that rarely even becomes visible to white eyes . And that same system either ignores whiteness or even privileges it .\n\nThe criminal justice system, alone, is rife with examples including racial profiling , stop-and-frisk policies, police brutality and the failed War on Drugs . Add to that voter ID laws , redlining , and credit scores . Add to that the use of bigoted and prejudiced textbooks , punishing non-white students more harshly than white students, underfunding public schools , and closing them down if they're attended mostly by students of color .\n\nYet that doesn't mean white people are impervious to civil rights violations . It just means that people of color are targeted much more often and are in much greater need of help than we are.\n\nYet many of us refuse to admit it. We refuse even though doing so actually puts ourselves at greater risk.\n\nThink about it. If we ignore the civil rights concerns of those most victimized, who will be there for us when we're targeted?\n\nTake police brutality.\n\nAccording to the Guardian's \"The Counted\" project , 1,092 Americans were killed by police in 2016. If we look at it proportionately, a much higher percentage of minorities were killed than white people. Specifically, Native Americans were killed at 10.13 per million, black people at 6.66 per million, while Hispanics and Latinos were killed at 3.23 per million. By comparison, white people were only killed at 2.9 per million.\n\nSo minorities were killed at much higher rates than whites given their smaller percentages of the population. However, if we look at the raw numbers, more white people were killed than any other group. Specifically, the police killed 574 whites, 266 blacks, 183 Hispanics/Latinos and 24 Native Americans.\n\nSo, yes, the African American community is right to be angry that they're being disproportionately targeted by police. However, more than 500 white people were killed by law enforcement, too. That's a troubling figure all by itself. Why are American police killing so many of us? Why is law enforcement so trigger happy in the USA?\n\nIt's a problem for everyone . Police should not be killing such high numbers of civilians. In fact, in other countries, they don't. Police kill more people in the U.S. in days than they do in other countries in years. Yet very few police officers actually serve jail time. Several officers went to trial in 2016, but only a handful were convicted.\n\nThis is a real problem, yet many white people dismiss it as a black issue -- and an illegitimate one at that. As a country, we have a real concern with the way police are trained, protocol for when deadly force is allowed and how officers are held accountable. But we're letting this issue fall through the cracks because it's being delegitimized as a \"mere\" civil rights complaint.\n\nThings have really changed in this country.\n\nIn 1963, when the all-Black 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama, was bombed by four members of the Ku Klux Klan, the entire society took notice. Even whites who had been unsympathetic to the civil rights struggles of African Americans up to this point were disturbed at the murder of four children and the injury of 22 others. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. , called it \"one of the most vicious and tragic crimes ever perpetrated against humanity,\" and it marked a turning point in our history. The fight for civil rights became a multi-racial, multi-ethnic, American struggle to secure equality for our brother and sister African Americans.\n\nHowever, just two years ago when Dylann Roof was inspired by white supremacist websites to kill nine people at an all-Black Church in Charleston, South Carolina, the response was... meh. Though it has been categorized as a hate crime, it has done nothing to wake up the society at large to the realities of modern-day American racism. At most, it's dismissed as an isolated event.\n\nHowever, it's not. White supremacists have long targeted African American churches as objects of their hatred. In 1991, it took a series of 154 suspicious church burnings for Congress five years later to pass the Church Arson Prevention Act, making it a federal crime to damage religious property because of its \"racial or ethnic character.\" More recently, a black church in Massachusetts was burned down the day after President Barack Obama was inaugurated in 2009.\n\nFor some reason, these continuing hate crimes fail to rouse the public at large. Perhaps the Internet culture and the perpetuation of so-called news sources that only support partisan confirmation bias has something to do with it. But it's harmful to all of us.\n\nWhen white people ignore the legitimate claims of Black people, they make it easier for everyone to be mistreated. Often, white people have acted as if prejudice could never be perpetrated against them, and when it's cropped up, we've defined it narrowly to fit only the immediate group targeted. That's an LGBT issue. That's a Jewish issue. That's an issue for people with disabilities. We rarely see them as they are: human issues.\n\nIn the age of Trump , violations of individual rights are popping up every day: journalists receiving felony charges for covering unrest at the inauguration , a Louisiana bill that makes resisting arrest a hate crime punishable by 10 years in prison, proposed laws in 10 states to criminalize peaceful protects , and on and on.\n\nNor is it partisan. Here are a list of human rights violations under Obama : drone strikes outside active war zones, ongoing use of massive civilian surveillance programs, failure to close Guantanamo Bay, harsh penalties for whistle blowers and no accountability for those they expose.\n\nWe live in an age where our rights are being eroded by ignorance, indifference, and the uncritical acceptance of prepacked political narratives. The powers that be use racism and prejudice to keep us divided so we'll never mount an effective opposition .\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "It's Time To Stop Calling Diverse Groups Of People 'Minorities'\n\nRetired Charge Nurse and secondary school teacher. You can read her insightful articles on community issues at montrealcommunitycontact.com\n\nThe Canadian government uses the term \"visible minority\" as a classification of groups of people. The government defines the term as \"persons, other than aboriginal peoples, who are non-Caucasian in race or non-white in colour.\"\n\nThis classification has lured controversy both nationally and abroad. In 2007, the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination openly voiced their concerns to the Canadian government regarding the use of the term, arguing it's in violation of the goals and objectives of the International Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination, which came into effect in 1969. The Committee recommended an evaluation of this classification.\n\nObliged to respond, the government had academics research the term's history, nationally and internationally, held an open workshop to gather more input, and canvassed provincial and territorial governments on their use of the term in Canada.\n\nIn 2011, a Government of Canada report put forward to the Committee said there were no plans of changing the standard usage of the term.\n\nWhy do we allow ourselves to be called minorities? Minority means less than 50 per cent. White people constitute about 20 per cent of the world's population, so how could all of the other ethnic racial groups be lumped together and classified as minorities? Doing so leads people of colour to fall into an amorphous blob of otherness, no longer existing as people and communities\n\nSome may say that the Canadian government only uses the term to refer to Canada's population, where white people do make up a majority. The full and proper term is \"member of a minority group,\" but is usually shortened to \"minority.\" It's very rarely expanded to \"member of a minority group in Quebec or Canada,\" which would be a more satisfying inclusion.\n\nAnother equally troubling and co-existing term is \"non-white.\" One wonders why this term is always used, while \"non-black\" is never even uttered. Is it due to the fact that white is somehow seen as the standard, when, in fact, there is no standard group to which all others must be compared?\n\nImagine for a brief moment what goes through the minds of our young children. They enter school ready and eager to learn, to soak up everything and anything that is presented to them. Over time they are led to believe that they're \"a member of a disadvantaged, non-white minority group,\" which will engender diminished self-worth.\n\nI hope to see the word phased out in favour of a more people-centered approach, especially during the International Decade for People of African Descent ."

      "text": "Minorities In America: The Time To Fight For One Another Is Now\n\nHuffPost Queer Voices Editor\n\nThe night of President Donald Trump 's election, I left The Huffington Post newsroom and walked from Manhattan back to my Brooklyn apartment.\n\nThere, I sat and watched the electoral votes continue to pour in for Trump, feeling a heavy, inescapable sense of dread as I tried to imagine what the next four years would be like based on the way he ran his campaign .\n\nMy roommate cried for hours. Social media became an unusable space of mass hysteria. I cleaned my kitchen just to have something to do. I wrote about the feeling. I texted my mom.\n\nAnd now, less than three months later, we are seeing the true ramifications of this moment in American politics. The \"Muslim ban .\" The wall . The imminent healthcare repeal . An endorsement of torture . Abortion restrictions .\n\nAll of it is targeted legislation that disproportionately affects the most vulnerable people in America: minorities.\n\nWe knew this could ― and likely would ― happen. That the religious right would be rewarded for their loyalty after President Trump won the election, putting minorities' rights and protections under attack just as veteran LGBTQ activists warned us .\n\nAnd now that it actually seems to be happening ― how do we respond?\n\nFirst, we recognize that that our struggles and fight for liberation as minority Americans are all interconnected ― and our activism and resistance needs to be intersectional as well.\n\nWomen, LGBTQ people, people of color, immigrants, refugees, disabled people ― we are all under threat at the hands of this administration and must fight for each other across the lines of identity politics.\n\nThis is already happening all over. Minorities are showing up for other minorities and not waiting until their own community is under attack ― and we need to keep the momentum going.\n\n📷via @amyschumer #resist #nobannowall #refugeeswelcome\n\nA photo posted by nasty signs (@nastysigns) on Jan 30, 2017 at 6:53am PST\n\nFamiliarize yourself with groups, organizations and nonprofits that are engaged in protecting the rights and lives of the most vulnerable Americans. From the ACLU to Lambda Legal to the Council on American-Islamic Relations , it's crucial that we are intentional and thoughtful about where we're allocating time, energy and resources as we push back against targeted legislation.\n\nWe also need to be visible by continuing to engage in protests. It's just as important to show up to the airport as it was to participate in the Women's March .\n\nOur protesting should be creative in order to catch the attention of the media ― and also relentless, we should use social media to organize quickly and effectively ― especially if these Executive Orders continue to roll out at the rate we've seen over the last 12 days.\n\nAnd finally, and perhaps most importantly, we need to look out for each other.\n\nOne of the most radical and tangible things we can do right now is going out of our way to take care of one another, and be empathetic to the struggles of our fellow minority American.\n\nText your friends. Call your family. Send Facebook messages. Go to support groups.

      "text": "Ethnic Minorities Deserve Safe Spaces Without White People\n\nA fourth-year journalism student at Ryerson University interested in representations of minorities in mainstream media.\n\nLast week The Ryersonian reported on an incident that involved two first-year journalism students who were turned away from an event organized by Racialized Students' Collective because they are white. Since then there has been a lot of commentary on the piece and a lot of debate -- a lot of the criticism is valid.\n\nThere are two sides to the story: 1) the media has a right to attend public events and report on matters that are in the public interest. The student media needs to cover initiatives that are happening on campus so that we draw attention to them and in turn create awareness (The Ryersonian reported that one student said he was covering the meeting for an assignment). 2) Marginalized groups have a right to claim spaces in the public realm where they can share stories about the discrimination they have faced without judgment and intrusion from anyone else.\n\nI am a person of colour and a journalist and so there are two conflicting voices inside my head. But in this case one voice, that of a person of colour, is louder and my conscience does not allow me to be impartial. I have to take a side.\n\nThe organizers of the event, the Racialized Students' Collective, should have done a better job of labelling this event as a safe space on the Ryerson Students' Union online calendar. They should label safe spaces clearly and maybe even host events that educate the public on what they mean. Doing so will help the public and the media have a better understanding of the purpose and value of these spaces.\n\nHowever, the point to note is not that two white students were asked to leave the event, but rather that this was a safe space and that we as a newsroom, as a campus and as a society are not as knowledgeable as we should be about what these spaces mean.\n\nIt's not just important, but it's essential, for marginalized groups to have safe spaces on campus to engage with people who understand what they go through. Though this group is funded by Ryerson's student union, it works to serve a particular group and a particular purpose. Many students at Ryerson have encountered racism in their life that is impossible to forget and many are exposed to discrimination on a daily basis. This group and these sort of events allow people of colour to lay bare their experiences and to collectively combat this societal ailment. These spaces are rare places in the world not controlled by individuals who have power, who have privilege.\n\nThese spaces, which are forums where minority groups are protected from mainstream stereotypes and marginalization, are crucial to resistance of oppression and we, as a school and as a society, need to respect them.\n\nEarlier in the week a newsroom colleague and I went to an ad-hoc committee meeting on sexual assault policy. When we arrived we were told it was a safe space, and that we would not be able to report on anything that would be discussed in the meeting.\n\nWe understood the value of these sorts of events, where people can share their common struggles. Our understanding let us attend and contribute to the conversation, even if we couldn't report about it.\n\nWe understood the people there had a right to privacy. They had a right to collectively work through the challenges society had imposed on them. They had a right to claim parts of the campus, parts of the world, for a few hours in hopes of creating broader social change.\n\nThe two students who tried to enter the RSC meeting said that they were embarrassed when they were asked to leave and that the group was being counterproductive in sectioning themselves off. Similarly, some of the comments on the piece written about these students speaks to the idea that excluding certain people from these events, this dialogue, is encouraging racial tension. Their embarrassment isn't as important as the other issues involved here.\n\nSegregation was imposed on people of colour by people of privilege, not the other way around. The very fact that individuals organizing to help each other get through social barriers and injustices are being attacked and questioned for their peaceful assembly is proof that they were right to exclude those students.\n\nRacialized people experience systemic discrimination on a daily basis, on many levels, and in ways that white people may never encounter. The whole point of these safe spaces is to remove that power dynamic. That's partly what makes them spaces for healing.\n\nThe presence of any kind of privilege puts unnecessary pressure on the people of colour to defend any anger or frustrations they have, to fear the outcome of sharing their stories. The attendees are trying to move forward by supporting each other and they should not have to defend themselves, they should not fear the consequences of raising their voices.\n\nInstead of focusing on why those students were asked to leave, we should be thinking about the history of oppression that makes these kinds of groups and these kinds of places so very important. We should be focusing on how to be aware and respectful of the rights of both the press and marginalized groups. We have to find a way to coexist peacefully.\n\nThe West has a history of oppressing people of colour: from Africans who were enslaved and brought to the New World, to native people whose land was stolen by Europeans. This kind of oppression is still witnessed today, in the way the black community is treated in the United States, in the state of African nations trying to recover from the collapse of the previous colonial rule, and in the continuing struggles of indigenous peoples.\n\nWhite people may experience occasional and unacceptable prejudice, but not racism. They do not experience the systemic racism that makes it hard for them to find jobs, housing, health care and justice in the legal system.\n\nRacism is not personal, it is structural. Unlike the arena of mainstream media, the educational system, religious institutions and judicial systems that reinforce hurtful stereotypes, these spaces remind the oppressed that they are human, that they deserve respect.\n\nMORE ON HUFFPOST:"

      "text": "How Racism And Inequality Have Left Minorities Most At Risk From Covid-19\n\nNews reporter, HuffPost UK\n\nAs many as a third of coronavirus patients may be Black or Asian, nearly three times the 13% proportion of the UK population that they make up.\n\nSome 14% of those with the most serious cases were Black and the same amount were Asian, according to the research, sparking calls for further probes into structural inequality and health outcomes.\n\nThe alarming figures come from a study of 2,000 people by the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC).\n\nLord Simon Woolley , chair of the landmark Race Disparity Audit 's advisory group, said this research reflected the need for the government to appoint a minister dedicated to furthering racial equality.\n\n\"This should be a wake up call for the government in regard to how it responds,\" he told HuffPost UK.\n\n\"There must be a minister with responsibility for race that needs to sit around these decision making tables ensuring how they mitigate the disproportionate impact that is occurring for Black and minority communities; this has to be at a cabinet level.\n\n′′This is urgent and it's right because in greater numbers it is our communities saving lives. So there's a moral response to this as well as an economic and political response that the policy should close inequalities rather than ignore it.\"\n\nThe study is thought to be the first analysis of its kind anywhere in the world looking at the ethnic breakdown of cases of Covid-19.\n\nSo, why are Black, Asian and minority ethnic people more susceptible to becoming critically ill as a result of coronavirus?\n\nFor starters, these communities are at greater risk of developing long-term health conditions. Over-65s in four ethnic groups - Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Gypsy and Irish Traveller, and Arab - have particularly poor health-related quality of life.\n\nStudies also show people with south Asian backgrounds have a higher prevalence of diabetes and heart disease, which are two of the health conditions that puts people in the higher risk categories for Covid-19.\n\nMeanwhile, Black people also have an increased risk of hypertension and diabetes.\n\nBlack and South Asian people are more likely to have a stroke than the general population, partly due to a greater likelihood of experiencing pre-hospital delays and limited awareness of stroke symptoms.\n\nFor some people, certain illnesses can be down to lifestyle. For example, many traditional foods in non-white communities are typically higher in sugar and starch, which can heighten the risk of developing conditions such as type two diabetes.\n\nBut poverty plays also plays a part. That, in itself, is anxiety inducing. Besides that, healthy food in the UK is three times more expensive than unhealthy food, a 2018 report by the Food Foundation highlights .\n\nGiven that BAME households are most likely to be in persistent poverty and food bank usage is soaring, they are usually priced out of being able to afford the most nutritionally rich food.\n\nBlack people who suffer from asthma, like Metroline bus driver Emeka Nyack Ihenacho , have higher mortality rates than white people.\n\nAll of these underlying health issues exacerbate the risk of a Covid-19 patient developing further complications.\n\nThe Race Disparity Audit in 2017 also revealed that Black adults reported the lowest ratings for life satisfaction - the feeling that things they do in life are worthwhile, and happiness.\n\nPeople from BAME communities face a higher risk of serious mental illness due to the disproportionate impacts of socioeconomic factors such as poverty and marginalisation.\n\nOn that note, Black people are twice as likely than adults in other ethnic groups to have been sectioned under the Mental Health Act.\n\nThat stress and poor mental health can damage physical health is well established. However, the correlation between racial discrimination, stress and physical illness is lesser known.\n\nA recent US study shows the stress caused by experiencing constant racism can shorten the lives of Black people, by triggering genes that cause chronic inflammation and deadly illnesses.\n\nThe research, published in the journal Psychoneuroendocrinology, found genes that promote inflammation are expressed more often in Black people than their white counterparts.\n\nPlus - how do you effectively self-isolate when you have less space at home to begin with?\n\nMany individuals in south Asian families, for example, live in multi-generational households.\n\nIn addition to this, overcrowding affects ethnic minority households disproportionately, who are less likely to own their own home and most likely to rent social housing.\n\nFrom school attainment to mental health, the impact can be dire and London in particular - where Covid-19 in the UK is most rife - has one of the highest rates of overcrowding of all regions of England.\n\nRelative to the UK population overall, people living in households headed by someone in the Asian, Black or other ethnic groups are disproportionately likely to be on a low income .\n\nAnd people in this situation cannot simply \"get out of the hood\", even if they want to.\n\nMost are not able to adhere to government self-isolation advice in the event that they contract Covid-19 or someone around them does. They are, for all intents and purposes, stuck and left to wrangle with an impossible enemy.\n\nMoreover, Westminister's lack of acknowledgement of these all-too-common circumstances suggests it may be, once again, out of touch with marginalised groups at the fringe of society.\n\nBlack, Asian and minority ethnic communities face other barriers to healthcare access.\n\nKayla Williams, 36-year-old mother of three , died on March 21, a day after paramedics were called to her home in Peckham and she was told to look after herself at home due to not being a \"priority\".\n\nDocuments seen by the Guardian confirmed paramedics were treating her as a suspected Covid-19 case.\n\nI don't want to reach but is this not a possible case of medical racism/bias? This is the second case I've seen of black women refused care for Coronavirus. The last one was one of my mutual followers who was denied care for herself and new born baby. It has begun.\n\nWilliams's case raised questions about how far her ethnicity impacted her treatment or lack thereof.\n\nThere is some evidence of unequal access to pre-hospital care for Black and minority ethnic communities.\n\nA study by the Race Equality Foundation cited \"stereotypical views among providers\" were one reason for this disparity.\n\nA spokesperson from the Equality and Human Rights Commission acknowledged that, while Covid-19 does not discriminate, it is impacting people differently.\n\n\"We continue to monitor how the pandemic and the response to it is affecting different groups who are already disadvantaged in other ways, and have made clear recommendations for how the UK and devolved governments should best respond to this unprecedented situation,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"We remind all organisations that carry out public functions, such as government departments and regulators, of their legal responsibility under the public sector equality duty to consider how they are meeting the needs of, for example, disabled people, older people, and ethnic minorities.\n\n\"The implications of the emergency coronavirus legislation on different groups must be understood, reviewed and mitigated to ensure they are not further left behind.\"\n\nPeople of Black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds account for a large proportion of essential workers, which goes some way to explaining the racial disparity - non-white people are literally in the firing line.\n\nThe first four doctors who lost their lives were either of Black or south Asian descent: Adil El Tayar, Alfa Sa'adu, Habib Zaidi and Amged el-Hawrani.\n\nJust hours after these fatalities were announced, it was announced that Black healthcare assistant Thomas Harvey had died after treating sick patients with only gloves for protection, and Areema Nasreen, a nurse who died at the hospital where she worked, had passed away.\n\nPeople with Black and Asian backgrounds are overrepresented among the NHS workforce .\n\nAnd some 20% of adult social care workers, like Carol Jamabo, are from Black, Asian or minority ethnic communities compared with 14% of the population, according to a 2018 report by the Department of Health & Social Care .\n\nIn London, more than a quarter of TfL staff are from minority backgrounds, according to its own data . This is double their proportion in the UK population.\n\nSome 14 London transport workers have died of coronavirus, it was revealed on Wednesday. Bus drivers last week told HuffPost UK they were being forced to work without adequate personal protective equipment (PPE), and worried about being exposed to Covid-19 and not being paid if they don't work.\n\nMoreover, TfL's own statistics reveal how huge its ethnicity pay gap is.\n\nThis exemplifies another sad reality; many of these essential roles, largely occupied by non-white people, are not well paid, and poverty is a factor in poor health outcomes.\n\nMore than half the ICNARC study sample was from London and Birmingham areas where Black, Asian and minority groups are prevalent.\n\nBased on this, some argue that the results are skewed and would invariably rank BAME groups disproportionately.\n\nThe Runnymede Trust, leading UK race equality think tank, on Friday published a report alongside t he Centre on Dynamics of Ethnicity, highlighting the extent of race inequalities in the UK, arguing that Covid-19 is likely to widen the gap.\n\nDr Zubaida Haque, deputy director of Runnymede, told HuffPost UK: \"We need to be cautious about this data for several reasons - there's not enough disaggregation and information about the patients.\n\n\"However, it's important to recognise that some Black and ethnic minority groups are more likely to be vulnerable to severe illness from Covid-19 because they are more likely to be among the poorest socio-economic groups, living in insecure and overcrowded housing and in low paid and precarious work.\n\n\"Some of this work is also bringing them into more contact with Covid-19 as BAME workers are also disproportionately represented in the NHS as well as some of the other key worker categories such as transport and delivery drivers, and social care workers.\"\n\nHaque called upon Public Health England to collate and analyse Covid-19 data by ethnicity, gender, age and other protected characteristics, in order to monitor racial disparities.\n\n\"Inequalities must be seen as a risk factor for severe illness from coronavirus,\" she added.\n\nLord Woolley, who founded Operation Black Vote in 1996, also backed a campaign to name the new Birmingham Covid-19 hospital after Mary Seacole.\n\nA petition supporting the cause has amassed over 12,000 signatures .\n\n\"That response is the lowest hanging fruit,\" he said. \"By naming it as that, it's an acknowledgement not only of the contributions that Black and minority ethnic communities are making now - but have done since the inception of the NHS, particularly by the Windrush generation .\""

      "text": "Immigrants and Minorities of America, Unite!\n\nAuthor, a professional educator and diversiculturalist\n\nAliens at the Gate!\n\nPeople fear aliens. They fear aliens because they fear unpredictability: unpredictability makes people uncomfortable. This is at the root of what many in the public feel towards minorities: they are different, and people may be wary of them. To reduce this unpredictability, they create stereotypes boosting their behavior -- prediction confidence -- and partially dismissing their fears. People sometimes give names to stereotypes, such as \"women's logic.\"\n\nAttitudes towards immigrants are often of a similar nature, amplified by their thick accents, different behavior, body language, you name it. Many people's perceptions of immigrants differ from their perceptions of the rest of minorities because of the public's perceived power to prevent immigrants from coming. Many conservatives ride this wave, playing the \"aliens\" card . Magic Mirror\n\nIt never ceases to amaze me how the media interprets the Census discussing a \" model minority ,\" the most successful ethnic group. The term is controversial at best, and the \"nominees\" are ever-changing. It's like asking, \"Magic mirror on the wall, who's the fairest one of all?\" Who needs this kind of information except the wicked Queen? Needless to say, the model-minority discussions sparkle hot debates . To me, these debates--along with deliberations on the mounting numbers of immigrants--distract us from some core concerns. Indeed, there exist better means for identifying national issues than asking magic mirrors or mulling the numbers - such as tapping commonsense.\n\nIll-defined Lines and Well-Defined Issues\n\nSo far, split-up lines between legal immigrants and minorities have been ill-defined: once a documented immigrant lands in America, he/she becomes just another drop in the lake of the existing ethnic minority, with the language-culture skills to grow on the go. Presumably, the first-generation immigrants come to America by choice, while the established minorities have been born in the land--but integration is only a matter of time. The real issue runs deeper. The wildly diverse immigrant and minority groups have one common issue, awkward like an elephant under the table: they still remain societal underdogs facing attitudes of condescension and scapegoating. One may be a big hero, but it's hard to get the \"likes.\" For lack of a better word, let's call this defined issue, \"gaining recognition.\"\n\nObstructing their progress, this attitude problem has huge significance. It cannot be resolved by policy-changing. It's so deep-rooted--plus provoked by certain political instigators profiting from easy popularity --that it requires long-term concentrated effort by both immigrant and minority groups. Unfortunately, they seldom act together, which is counter to common sense.\n\nCommonsense Goals\n\nInstead of sitting on different fences, immigrant and minority organizations need to coordinate/unite their efforts with one strategic goal in mind: converting people's perceptions and gaining merited recognition. One commonsense tactical goal may be advancing children's education.\n\nWhy education? Remember Sergei Brin , a co-founder of Google , who immigrated to the US at age 13? He got a good education, and we got Google. But other little Brins - of ethnic minorities - may have the similar talent, achievement-orientation, penchant for risk and innovation, and the same immigrant creativity originating from their double-culture perspective--but no funding for the right education. If we help them - so that not only the well-prepped children of the rich could become American meritocracy - America's future will be broader-based and steadier. As statistics of immigrant/minority communities are swelling , it makes common sense to swell their quality/excellence too.\n\nImmigrant, Minority, and Great Achiever: Three in One\n\nHere's one case study from my upcoming book , of how immigrant creativity, minority forte, and global success unite to give us a praiseworthy role-model to follow.\n\nJosie Natori , from the Philippines - Proud to Be Asian-American\n\nSharp & bold like her lingerie designs, Josie Natori, the founder and CEO of the Natori Company , is proud of her roots. Josie went a long way reinventing herself from an island girl, to college student, to Merrill Lynch VP, to famous fashion designer. Ever since coming to America to study, she was able to turn what others could perceive as her disadvantage - being an Asian immigrant and a strong woman - to a unique advantage. How? In several ways:\n\n1.At Merrill Lynch, she's been adding the valued diversity touch to the firm's all-male top team (pictured): \"Coming from the Philippines, one of the few matriarchal societies in the world, I never thought I could be discriminated [against]--and never was! ... I got promoted on merit. I used to say that I counted as two--being a woman plus being an Asian. I made being an Asian woman an asset instead of a liability , and was surprised that they make such a big deal out of this issue.\"\n\n2.After founding the Natori Company, she interweaved the exquisite Asian aesthetics into her luxury lingerie and home items design-- building a distinct brand, blending the visual appeals of both the East and the West, with non-stop global success. She's happy to give back to society, supporting progressive projects, young talent and women.\n\n3.Josie displayed similar common sense in her private life: \"I am too advanced and bold in my free spirit to have married an Asian-born Asian; this is why I married a Japanese-American born in the US: he still had the Asian values but grew up here and was more assimilated in the US--so he accepted a strong woman as his wife.\" (Pictured with husband Kenneth Natori and grandchildren of Philippine-Japanese-Jewish-Polish-Mexican descent). How wise!\n\nThe point is: an immigrant becomes part of a minority community and then - an integral part of the all-American culture. Such seamless transitions certainly benefit all Americans.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "As President, Pete Buttigieg Wants to Give 25 Percent of Federal Contracts to Minorities. As Mayor, He Gave 3 Percent.\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nEven as Buttigieg pushes diversity efforts as mayor, less than 3 percent of South Bend's business in 2018 went to minority- and women-owned firms.\n\nOne of the main tenets of Pete Buttigieg's plan to address racial inequality if he becomes president is a proposal to increase the number of federal contracting dollars going to women- and minority-owned businesses to 25 percent . But in South Bend, Indiana, where he has been mayor since 2012, less than 3 percent of city business has gone to minority- and women-owned businesses in recent years, according to annual audits conducted by the city .\n\nIn July, Buttigieg released \" The Douglass Plan: A Comprehensive Investment in the Empowerment of Black America ,\" which he called \"the most comprehensive vision put forward by a 2020 candidate on the question of how we're going to tackle systemic racism in this country.\" On Friday, The Intercept reported that the Buttigieg campaign had publicized support for the plan from prominent black leaders who actually weren't endorsing it.\n\nRelated Pete Buttigieg Touted Three Major Supporters of His Douglass Plan for Black America. They Were Alarmed When They Saw It.\n\nSouth Bend's population is 26.4 percent black , compared to 13.4 percent nationally. According to a 2015 report released by the mayor's office, 1.2 percent of the city's purchases went to contracts with minority- and women-owned businesses that year. In 2016 , the number was 1.7 percent; in 2017 , it was 1.9 percent; in 2018 , it was 2.8 percent.\n\nSouth Bend already had a reputation for a lack of diversity among its business partners.  As mayor, Buttigieg made it a priority to address those issues. He put in place several initiatives to address the problem, using his first executive order in 2016 to create the city's Office of Diversity and Inclusion . He hired Christina Brooks , who had previously worked on diversity and inclusion policies at the University of Notre Dame, to run the office. Under Brooks, the city commissioned a study analyzing the number of city contracts going to minority- and women-run firms, with Buttigieg saying that he wanted to set minimum goals for improving the numbers. Buttigieg also commissioned a profile on wealth inequality and race in South Bend in 2017, which showed that 40 percent of black people in the city fell below the poverty line, almost twice the national average.\n\n\"For 32 years we kind of limped along as a city, patching and piecing together strategies to achieve the progress that was our original intent,\" Brooks said. The \" disparity study \" marked a turning point, she said, and provided data community activists had been asking for for years.\n\n\"As Mayor of South Bend, Pete has routinely been the first in South Bend history to shed light on opportunity gaps and address them in order to promote equity and economic inclusion at the municipal level,\" campaign spokesperson Sean Savett said in a statement to The Intercept, noting the various diversity efforts the city had undergone under Buttigieg, including the first disparity study. \"As a result of that study, which found the city is eighty percent of the way there on contracting with women-owned and minority-owned businesses, Pete's administration worked to pass reforms to improve the procurement process to actively spur wealth generation for communities of color.\"\n\nButtigieg's office commissioned the $250,000 study last June to analyze the distribution of city contracts, using a different scope than the 3 percent cited above. The city's disparity study, covering 2015 through 2017 and completed in October, includes subcontractors (who do not contract with the city directly), and does not include contracts under $50,000. According to that formula, 12 percent of the city's contract dollars - including construction-related activities that involved goods, services, professional services, or construction itself - went to minority- or women-owned businesses, out of the 15 percent of eligible contractors in those categories . The city this month changed an existing ordinance to include quotas to improve those numbers such that the city does 15 percent of its business with minority- and women-owned businesses.\n\nA slide from the City of South Bend's 2019 Disparity Study.\n\nThe different scope of the diversity study allowed the city to better understand the marketplace of available minority and women-owned business enterprises, Brooks said.\n\nAs mayor, Buttigieg also implemented trainings for minority and women-owned businesses, and the city paid to renovate what is now the West Side Small Business Resource Center , located in an area of the city with a black and Hispanic population. The center, which opened in September, is \"the only one located on that side of town,\" Brooks said, and had been more successful at engaging minority entrepreneurs than other business resource centers in the city. \"It makes a difference when you have those resources within walking distance of where you live, and where you have staff members that are from the neighborhoods and the areas that you reside in.\"\n\nOriginal reporting.

Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nAt a presentation on the disparity study last month, Buttigieg told community members and black entrepreneurs that he wanted to \"proactively\" correct the city's track record and \"make sure that in a diverse city, our taxpayer dollar spending reflects the diversity of the community we serve.\"\n\nButtigieg announced last week that Brooks will leave the post in early December. She will continue doing similar work for the city of Fort Worth, Texas.\n\nCiti Foundation, an affiliate of CitiBank, and Living Cities , a collaborative of foundations and financial institutions focused on uplifting low-income people, in June announced that South Bend won a $50,000 grant to implement the goals in the diversity report, including coaching and technical assistance. South Bend was one of 10 cities selected for similar grants.\n\nUpdate: November 20, 2019, 10:15 a.m. ET After publication, the Buttigieg campaign sent information that contradicted a news report about the city's disparity study, as well as information the campaign had provided to The Intercept. The story has been updated to clarify that the city's disparity study found that 12 percent of its contracts and subcontracts over $50,000 over a three-year period from 2015 to 2017 went to minority- and women-owned businesses. The disparity study used a different metric than the city's own annual diversity report, which found that only 1.2 percent, 1.7 percent, and 1.9 percent of city contracts went to minority- and women-owned businesses in 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively.\n\nUpdate: November 20, 2019, 8:36 p.m. ET This piece has been updated to include an image from South Bend's 2019 disparity study.\n\nWAIT!

How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren't on the beat?\n\nThe kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but it is not easy, cheap, or profitable.

What gives?\n\nIn 2010, the city of Toronto, one of the most ethnically diverse places in the world and a supposed bastion of liberalism, elected a man widely considered to be a racist as its mayor. Rob Ford was a vulgar and incoherent oaf, a former city councilor who clashed with his colleagues in public and went on racist tirades against seemingly every minority group. But when Ford successfully ran for office, it wasn't on the wave of a white backlash against diversity, as one might have expected. Instead it was immigrants and minorities, the very people Ford was supposedly insulting, who helped power his run. Not only that, for all his unapologetic crudity - probably even because of it - they loved him.\n\n\"He's drug-addled, overweight and uneducated - yet he's the mayor. In this against-all-odds success story, Ford is the anti-hero. He says things that the disenfranchised wish they could say,\" noted a 2014 magazine profile in Toronto Life about the mayor's surprising popularity with minorities.\n\n\"Nobody sticks up for people like I do, whatever the race,\" an inebriated Ford was once recorded saying, before, somewhat contradictorily, launching into a string of racial slurs and adding, \"I'm the most racist guy around. I'm the mayor of Toronto.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nI was living in Toronto at the time and witnessed Ford's rise. While the media fell over themselves to brand him as a racist, a title which he sort of embraced, Ford shocked them by drawing his most enthusiastic support from the immigrant-heavy, working-class suburbs where he was considered something of a folk hero. Many of my friends were supporters. To this day, several still fondly recall impromptu marijuana-smoking sessions with the then-mayor after running into him at gas stations or outside fast-food restaurants in the city. Although Ford was born into a wealthy family, people overlooked that, along with his hard-drug use , constant slurs, and general incompetence, to embrace him as an accessible everyman. (For the record: I did not share this sentiment.)\n\nThe more the media condemned him, the better Ford looked in the eyes of his supporters. Ford didn't offer much in terms of policies or good governance, but his outlandish personality represented an \"upraised middle finger,\" as Toronto Life put it, against what many people felt was an arrogant, hypocritical, and morally self-satisfied establishment.\n\nToronto Mayor Rob Ford signs autographs for kids after the official launch of Toronto 2015 Pan Am Games, at Nathan Phillips Square on July 11, 2014.\n\nI couldn't help but recall the story of Ford, who passed away from cancer four years ago, while watching reactions to exit polls from the 2020 U.S. presidential election. To the shock of many, the polls appeared to show increased nonwhite support for President Donald Trump. Such polls can be inaccurate and it's worth waiting to draw firm conclusions. The current numbers, however, suggest that after years of what many viewed as Trump's obvious racism, he drew more Black and Latino voters in this race than he did in his 2016 campaign against Hillary Clinton. The data, collected by Edison Research and published in the New York Times, also suggests that, in addition to marginal increases among Latinos and Black people, Trump drew around a third of all Asian voters - certainly enough to undermine the claim that his politics appeal solely to a narrow group of white nationalists.\n\nJoe Biden still won strong majorities across all nonwhite demographics, as Democratic politicians consistently have for many years. In key urban areas like Philadelphia, Milwaukee, Atlanta, and Phoenix, voters of color seemed to be decisive in pushing Biden to a likely victory in the election.\n\nYet given how much Trump seemed to embody the definitive racist candidate, and how strongly progressives have been betting on long-term demographic change as a point in their favor, it's worth asking how Trump managed to even marginally increase his appeal to nonwhite voters after four years of reckless and divisive politics. To put it another way: How did a seemingly open racist manage to maintain and even increase his support among Black, Latino, and other voters of color?\n\nOne reason may be that, for a lot of nonwhite voters, Trump simply did not fit their definition of racism. The understanding of what constitutes racism is often different across class lines, especially when we're talking about very ambiguous concepts like \"tropes\" and \"dogwhistles.\" Even when Trump makes what seem like obviously racially coded claims about immigration or crime, it's not clear that people of color feel he's talking about them personally. Trump seems glad to embrace Black and Latino supporters, for example, as long as they seem to fit with a certain image of success and conservatism.\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nRacial categories, of course, are complex, and clear racial voting blocs are a myth. Letting go of the idea that immigrants or people of color represent any type of political monolith might itself be progress. Trump, for instance, appears to have benefited greatly from Cuban American support in Florida's Miami-Dade County, a community that is coded as Latino, frequently identifies as white, and seems to have prioritized its anti-socialist politics above much else.\n\nLiberal politicians, for their part, have relished in using accusations of racism to establish their own bona fides as the true friends of people of color - and deserving of those demographics' reflexive political support. It doesn't always work out. Many people of all backgrounds feel disillusionment with a ruling establishment that is incapable of improving their lives and who they believe are sneering down at them culturally - a stereotype the right-wing media pushes relentlessly. The satisfaction of electing an outlandish candidate just to watch them freak out might just seem worth it.\n\nTrump supporters during a rally on West Gray Street in Houston, Texas, on Nov. 3, 2020.\n\nLike Rob Ford years ago, Trump gleefully employs almost every racial trope in the book, regularly stomping on the delicate rhetorical pieties of elite discourse in America. His behavior seems to have alienated some white voters, particularly among the college-educated, who are locked in a political and cultural death match with noncollege-educated white people. But Trump's general behavior does not seem to have harmed him in the same way with nonwhite voters.\n\n\"Perceptions of Trump as racist seem to be a core driving force pushing whites toward the Democrats. Why would the opposite pattern be holding among minority voters - i.e. the very people the president is purportedly being racist against?\" wrote Musa al-Gharbi, a professor of sociology at Columbia University, in a prescient article for NBC News published just before the election. \"It may be that many minority voters simply do not view some of his controversial comments and policies as racist. Too often, scholars try to test whether something is racist by looking exclusively at whether the rhetoric or proposals they disagree with resonate with whites. They frequently don't even bother to test whether they might appeal to minorities, as well.\"\n\n\"Yet when they do,\" al-Gharbi wrote, \"the results tend to be surprising.\"\n\nConservative rhetoric about issues like immigration, policing, and crime often appears to resonate with Black and Latino voters at least as much as conservative white voters - sometimes they even receive it more warmly. Both groups, along with a significant chunk of Asian Americans, also lean conservative on some issues, particularly religion , compared with white progressives who make up much of the Democratic voting coalition. All this, though, has not translated into majority support for the Republican Party - at least not yet - but it should be a serious warning sign to Democrats about taking nonwhite voters for granted.\n\nEarlier this year, al-Gharbi wrote another article about the excessive comfort liberal elites have developed about their role in defining the politics of race and racism in America: The elites assume that they are the ones who defend people of color against racism. The way that some liberals have allegedly employed the subject to undermine class-based appeals is only part of the story, al-Gharbi argued in the piece, appropriately titled , \"Who Gets to Define What's Racist?\"\n\n\"White elites - who play an outsized role in defining racism in academia, the media, and the broader culture - instead seem to define 'racism' in ways that are congenial to their own preferences and priorities,\" al-Gharbi wrote. \"Rather than actually dismantling white supremacy or meaningfully empowering people of color, efforts often seem to be oriented towards consolidating social and cultural capital in the hands of the 'good' whites.\"\n\nIn electoral politics, the picture tends to be more muddled, on account of several factors. For instance, it is clear that the charges against Trump as a racist are not just coming from educated white elites: Many of the activists, politicians, and ordinary people sounding the alarm about the president are themselves people of color from nonelite backgrounds.\n\nYet there is a logic to al-Gharbi's critique. For Democratic politicians, flush with self-confidence on these issues, it makes obvious sense to define \"racism\" in whatever way seems to give them an advantage over Republicans. This seems to be part of the impetus behind constantly embracing new renovations of language when it comes to issues involving people of color, even when the people of color in question don't always seem to share the same perspective .\n\nA Trump supporter gestures as a group gathers to show support for the president on Oct. 23, 2020 in Scranton, Pa.\n\nIn deeming themselves the arbiters of what is and isn't racist, liberals might risk politicizing the accusation and taking power away from people of color - the people who actually suffer from discrimination - thus reducing a truly serious issue into a political weapon to settle scores with other elites. This type of politicized use of racism accusations risks harming minorities by draining the power of a concept that they sometimes really do need to defend their rights and dignity from assault. To some extent, you can look for an example of the same phenomenon when it comes to how the accusation of anti-Semitism is used to deflect legitimate critiques of U.S. foreign policy toward Israel.\n\nIt is difficult to know what motivated the people of color who supported Trump this election. It's possible, for example, that his strongman appeal resonated with men for whom gender had more salience than racial identity in their voting decisions. But it is clear that Democrats have the opportunity to counter any such cultural influences with policies that would make a material difference in people's lives.\n\nThe thin gruel of symbolic racial identity politics offered by the Democrats is not doing much to help minorities, and many of them are not going to keep accepting it forever. Measures like an increased minimum wage and Medicare for All would reduce racial inequalities in significant, tangible ways while also appealing to the white working class, who would benefit from the same measures. Instead, for years, the Democrats sidestepped the more ambitious of these universal economic programs in favor of identity-based appeals that they hope will do just enough to get them through the gate. That approach is showing serious morbid symptoms at this point. The Democrats may have dodged the bullet this time, just narrowly, but liberals should consider the position they could have been in today were they not running against a proudly incompetent opponent presiding over a historic public health and economic disaster.\n\nNone of this is to say that Democrats should throw out the issues and values that they believe define them as a party. The effort to fight racial injustice itself comes from a good place and should not be abandoned. And, in my own humble opinion, Trump is indeed a racist. This is evidenced not only by his words , but by the cruelty and indifference he has often shown to nonwhite people in the U.S. and abroad . People from racialized backgrounds who choose to ignore this are making a huge mistake. But American liberalism also needs to walk and chew gum at the same time: supporting economic programs for universal uplift, while upholding the fact that people of all backgrounds in American society have equal rights and dignity.\n\nIt might be helpful to democratize our attitude toward racial justice - especially in opposition to some elite liberals who are trying to politicize anti-racism for their own purposes. If racism were treated as a mistake that people make and can be rectified, not a moralistic label that defines them, then it could take some of the heat out of the endless culture war that can lead possible allies to retreat into a defensive posture and obscure shared economic interests. Mercy and a recognition of universal human frailty are good sentiments to bring forward to our discussion of social ills like racism and misogyny.\n\nWhen Rob Ford died in 2016, thousands of people of all backgrounds marched in the streets in a genuinely emotional outpouring of grief for an incompetent, foul-mouthed, crack-smoking politician who was also, according to the public record, a racist. Ford, however, was at the end of the day just the mayor of a city. Trump, on the other hand, was elected to the most powerful job in the world - the president of an entire country in which millions of people, not a few of them minorities, are clearly clamoring for a strongman.\n\nThe unsettling results of this election should dispel any assumption that demographic change will inevitably rescue us from such a fate. Despite the likelihood of Trump's defeat in the presidential election, now more than ever, the liberal establishment looks feeble in the face of grave national challenges. There is still an opportunity to figure things out and rework a policy approach that appeals to a sustainable majority coalition of Americans. If this close election tells us anything though, it's that time is running out.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Federal \"Countering Violent Extremism\" Grants Focus on Minority Communities - Including in Schools\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe Brennan Center for Justice examines \"CVE\" grants focusing on minority communities, which critics say are just a new approach to surveillance.\n\nThe United States government offers millions of dollars in grants for local and state government agencies with the stated purpose of rooting out potential terrorists, but the people receiving those grants have particular targets in mind: minorities. These minority communities, particularly Muslims, are the focus of the anti-terror grants despite surging white supremacist political violence . Some 85 percent of the grants - which are offered by the federal government under the controversial rubric of Countering Violent Extremism, or CVE, programs - target Muslims and other minority groups, according to a new study issued by the Brennan Center for Justice , a public policy and law institute.\n\n\"This programming is based on the idea that some communities - particularly Muslims, immigrants, and refugees - are more prone to ideological violence,\" said Faiza Patel, the co-director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center and a co-author of the report. \"But we've never seen attempts to 'build resiliency' among white communities following acts of violence by white Americans.\"\n\nImplicit in the Brennan Center's findings, which looked at some two dozen grant applications obtained through public records requests, was the characterization of increased local diversity as a potential national security risk. Many of the CVE applications echoed some of the toxic rhetoric of President Donald Trump's administration - a sign that anti-Muslim sentiment and bigotry at the top of the federal government was trickling down into local policy.\n\n\"One of things that is striking about these grants programs is that they are being implemented under an administration that is overtly hostile to diversity and wants to return to a time of a more ethnically homogenous America,\" she said. \"If that's your model for the country, you will obviously be prone to view diversity itself as a threat.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nCVE programs are ostensibly aimed at staunching the sort of \"radicalization\" that could lead to terrorist attacks, but in practice they have been widely panned by members of the communities the programs target. Criticisms of the program often state that the initiatives funded by CVE grants are ineffective and target these communities for unjust surveillance.\n\nThe Brennan Center report looks at approved grants from a number of local police departments across the country, as well as community groups and local government offices. Among the approved grants include programs intended to teach law enforcement agents and local community partners how to recognize violent extremist behaviors and indicators, as well as \"terrorism ideologies\" and the \"root causes of extremism.\"\n\nWhile the report noted that actually determining who will receive the CVE funding earmarked in the applications is difficult because many of the named recipients operate their programs through \"pass-through organizations\" that effectively act as subcontractors for the programs, an array of local government agencies applied for the funding.\n\nAmong the organizations listed as recipients of CVE grants are the Houston mayor's office; Minnesota's Hennepin County Sheriff, whose jurisdiction includes Minneapolis and its Somali enclaves; the Alameda County Sheriff's Office, which includes Oakland, California; and an array of domestic NGOs engaged in public safety and counter-extremism work. The grant applications typically include activities described as setting up workshops and trainings for \"community leaders,\" as well as the creation of reporting mechanisms for community members to inform law enforcement about extremist content that they encounter online or in the community. Many of the programs are explicit in their focus on Muslim communities.\n\n\"Law enforcement needs to be transparent about why they want to meet with communities,\" said Sahar Aziz, a national security expert at Rutgers University Law School. \"Community outreach in and of itself is not presumptively nefarious, but a problem arises when the outreach proceeds misleadingly and is actually a cover for law enforcement agencies doing anti-terrorism work. The way that manifests itself is by law enforcement using community outreach events as opportunities to gather intelligence, to identify possible targets for sting operations, or to identify possible informants for recruitment.\"\n\nThe introduction of CVE programs in the United States has long been a contentious issue for civil liberties groups. The programs are promoted as a softer approach to fighting terrorism. In 2015, the Obama administration held a three-day CVE \"summit\" at the White House, where it announced its intention to begin rolling out counter-extremism programs in a number of cities across the U.S. In 2016, the Department of Homeland Security's Office for Community Partnerships announced $10 million in CVE grants intended to fund programs in the U.S.\n\nBy deputizing ordinary people to act as informants against other members of their communities, critics say, the programs can act as tools of unjust surveillance for the government. In the United Kingdom, CVE programs have been blamed for creating a climate of fear among British Muslims, who have been targeted by medical professionals and teachers tasked with rooting out extremist ideologies among those they serve. These programs have led to perverse situations in which staff at children's nurseries were asked to identify possible extremism among the toddlers under their care. In the U.S., \"community outreach\" programs have sometimes served as cover for gathering intelligence on immigrant and minority communities. A 2015 report by The Intercept documented how law enforcement-led community outreach programs to Somali communities in Minnesota covertly operated as a channel for conducting surveillance.\n\n\"Ultimately, CVE needs to be shut down and communities need to be able to get funds from social service agencies such as Health and Human Services, and use those funds to support problems that they identify on their own and which are disconnected from CVE,\" said Aziz, the Rutgers professor, describing CVE as \"a politically correct term for counterterrorism.\"\n\nThe inclusion of CVE programming targeting schools and young people has been a particular source of concern for civil liberties groups. A 2016 FBI document about the threat of extremism among youth included numerous recommendations for schools to police possible radicalism among their students, including \"threat assessment teams,\" \"annual violent extremism training,\" and cooperation with law enforcement in intelligence gathering. The list of approved grants in the Brennan Center report include numerous school-related activities targeted at young people, raising concerns of the securitization of schools and discrimination against minority students. A grant program approved for the Denver Police Department, for example, includes plans for officers to lead a number of  CVE-related \"mentoring\" programs at five local middle and high schools, focused on young people determined to be \"at-risk\" by teachers, counselors, or other community members.\n\n\"Expanding CVE activities into schools undermines young people's ability to express themselves in ways protected by the constitution, by making hem feel like they will be under government scrutiny for their speech,\" said Johnathan Smith, legal director for the civil rights group Muslim Advocates. \"Very troubling issues of stereotyping and profiling also arise when you bring these types of programs into school settings. Schools should be places where students feel that they are being supported to [become] fully participating members of society, but these programs encourage teachers and other students to view their peers as inherently suspicious.\"\n\nRoughly half of the CVE grants highlighted by the Brennan Center mention protecting civil liberties, but without getting into specifics of how this will be accomplished. The Houston mayor's office names the Anti-Defamation League as a partner that will assist CVE program administrators in \"ensuring civil rights and liberties are protected.\" Yet the Anti-Defamation League - a group whose mission is opposing bigotry - has its own history of questionable surveillance of Muslim communities and, more recently, was helmed by Abraham Foxman, who was accused of harboring an anti-Muslim animus and defended blanket spying on American Muslims.\n\nInstead of viewing minority communities as threats and focusing on programs to surveil them, the Brennan Center's Patel said, the federal government should instead focus on putting resources into these communities for their betterment.\n\n\"If the government wants to spend money on helping Muslim communities, they shouldn't be doing so under the guise of countering extremism or counterterrorism,\" said Patel. \"They should begin by identifying community concerns, which will likely mirror those of other Americans, from bad schools to lack of opportunity. Addressing those issues would help support the core building blocks of good citizenship, and that's where this money would be better spent.\"\n\nTop photo: Men pray in the Eyup Cultural Center mosque in Brooklyn, N.Y., on Nov. 3, 2017.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Nonvoters Are Not Privileged. They Are Disproportionately Lower-Income, Nonwhite, and Dissatisfied With the Two Parties.\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe media and political class's depiction of abstention as a byproduct of class and racial privilege is a lie.\n\nNot even 24 hours have elapsed since Bernie Sanders announced that he was suspending his presidential run , and already a shaming campaign has been launched against those who are contemplating abstaining from voting due to dissatisfaction with the two major party candidates. The premise invoked for this tactic is that only those who are sufficiently \"privileged\" have the luxury of choosing not to vote - meaning that nonvoters are rich and white and thus largely immune from the harmful consequences of a Trump presidency, which largely fall on the backs of poorer and nonwhite Americans.\n\nThis tactic rests on a caricature: It is designed to suggest that the only people who make a deliberate and conscious choice not to vote due to dissatisfaction are white trust fund leftists whose wealth, status, and privilege immunize them from the consequences of abstention. By contrast, this \"You Must Vote\" campaign insists, those who lack such luxuries - poorer voters and racial minorities - understand that voting is imperative.\n\nThis assertion about the identity and motives of nonvoters is critical not only to try to bully and coerce people into voting by associating nonvoting with rich, white privilege, but also to suppress any recognition of how widespread the dissatisfaction is for both parties and the political system generally among poor and nonwhite citizens.\n\nBut the problem with this claim is a rather significant one: It is based on the outright, demonstrable falsehood that those who choose not to vote are primarily rich, white, and thus privileged, while those who lack those privileges - voters of color and poorer voters - are unwilling to abstain. This is something one can believe only if one's views of the country and its electorate are shaped by social media and cable news bubbles.\n\nThe truth is exactly the opposite. Those who choose not to vote because of dissatisfaction with the choices offered are disproportionately poorer and nonwhite, while rich white people vote in far larger percentages. And the data also makes clear that the primary motive for nonvoting among those demographic groups is not voter suppression but a belief that election outcomes do not matter because both parties are corrupt or interested only in the lives of the wealthy.\n\nThus, those who try to demean, malign and shame nonvoters are largely attacking poorer voters and voters of color, not the New York and California leftist trust-funders of their imagination.\n\nOne of the most comprehensive surveys of nonvoters was published by Pew Research Center on August 9, 2018. It summarized its bottom-line finding this way, the exact opposite of what is typically claimed by wealthy television media stars and D.C. operatives: \"Nonvoters were more likely to be younger, less educated, less affluent and nonwhite.\"\n\nThe Pew data on this issue is stark. Almost half of nonvoters in the 2016 presidential election were nonwhite, even though they compose only one-fourth of the voting population. Even more extreme is the data on class: More than half of nonvoters - 56% - are quite poor, making less than $30,000, even though that income group constitutes just over one-fourth of the voting population. The people who choose to vote are disproportionately privileged; those who are nonprivileged choose disproportionately not to vote.\n\nAs the Washington Post's summary of that survey put it: \"Pew's data shows that almost half of the nonvoters were nonwhite and two-thirds were under age 50. More than half of those who didn't vote earned less than $30,000 a year; more than half of those who did vote were over age 50.\"\n\nThose who choose not to vote - either those who are registered but do not vote or those who simply do not register - constitute a huge number of Americans. Indeed, the Post highlighted their size this way: \"about 30 percent of Americans were eligible to vote but decided not to, a higher percentage than the portion of the country who voted for either Trump or his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.\" And while rich white people chose to vote in large numbers in the 2016 presidential election, lower-income citizens and racial minorities composed a much larger portion of those who chose not to vote:\n\nIn November, New York Times data journalist Nate Cohn, analyzing data from a New York Times/Siena College survey of nonvoters in battleground states who abstained from voting both in 2016 and 2018, similarly described them as \"disproportionately young, nonwhite and low-income,\" adding that \"nonvoters are less likely to have graduated from a four-year college.\" In a separate article last July, Cohn noted that \"young and nonwhite and low-income voters are overrepresented among nonvoters,\" and \"young and nonwhite voters continued to vote at lower rates than older and white voters.\"\n\nThis was true not only for the 2016 election but also the 2018 mid-term election, by which time Trump had been president for almost two full years. As Cohn reported, \"young and nonwhite turnout was markedly higher than it had been in 2014, but still lower than that of older and white voters.\"\n\nPew found that \"in the U.S., roughly six-in-ten adults are registered to vote.\" Of them, \"four-in-ten Americans who were eligible to vote did not do so in 2016 .\" That means 40% of eligible voters in 2016 were nonvoters. The sheer number alone - millions of Americans - should preclude any claim that nonvoters are rich, white, and privileged people.\n\n[Even the voting preferences of the electorate are radically distorted by online \"privilege\" discourse: Aside from the fact that 28 percent of Hispanic people and 14 percent of black men voted for Trump in 2016 , rich white people voted for the Democratic candidate, not the GOP candidate, while poorer white people voted for Trump: \"whites with a four-year college degree or more education made up 30% of all validated voters. Among these voters, far more (55%) said they voted for Clinton than for Trump (38%). Among the much larger group of white voters who had not completed college (44% of all voters), Trump won by more than two-to-one (64% to 28%).\"]\n\nTo deny agency to poorer and nonwhite nonvoters, it is sometimes claimed that voter suppression efforts - rather than a cognizant and rational choice - is the primary factor explaining the behavior of poor and nonwhite nonvoters. That is also false.\n\nA separate Pew survey , in 2017, of people who are not registered to vote found exactly the opposite: that people who refrain from participating in the electoral process largely do so because they are dissatisfied with the choices or believe voting will not change their lives. As Pew put it: \"The unregistered were more likely to say they do not vote because they dislike politics or believe voting will not make a difference, while people who are registered but vote infrequently say they do not vote more often because they are not informed enough about the candidates or issues.\"\n\nIndeed, that Pew survey of unregistered voters found that the most common cause for not registering is that they do not want to vote , and the most common reasons have nothing to do with voter suppression and everything to do with beliefs about the worthlessness of the elections. As Pew put it, \"forty-four percent of eligible unregistered individuals say they do not want to vote,\" while \"25 percent say they are unregistered because they have not been inspired by a candidate or issue.\"\n\nAnd, Pew emphasized, both unregistered voters as well as registered voters who choose not to vote broadly express dissatisfaction with, or indifference toward, the two major parties and election outcomes as their motives: \"The unregistered are more likely to indicate a broad distaste for the electoral system than registered individuals, who tend to give election-specific motives for nonvoting, such as disliking the candidates or not knowing enough about the issues.\"\n\nThe Huffington Post, based on Pew data of people who chose not to vote in the 2018 midterm election, described the primary motive for abstention this way: \"many Americans who didn't vote in this year's midterm elections say they opted out due to a dislike of politics or a feeling their vote wouldn't matter.\" And nonvoters, it noted, also \" tend to skew younger, poorer and less white than those who do turn out.\"\n\nAll of this data demonstrates that, while GOP voter suppression efforts are both real and pernicious, nonvoting is overwhelmingly a choice. Indeed, the Pew survey of midterm voters and nonvoters concluded that, while minority voters disgracefully experience longer lines than white voters, \"about three-quarters of self-reported voters (76%) say it was 'very easy' for them to vote in the November elections. Another 16% say voting was 'somewhat easy.'\"\n\nWhile voter suppression is unquestionably a serious stain on U.S. political life that does (by design) impede voting, the overwhelming reason people stay home is due to cynicism toward or dissatisfaction with the political process and the choices they were presented. As the Huffington Post explained about the 2018 midterm elections, \"as a group, nonvoters also tend to be generally disengaged from public affairs and cynical about the government and their own roles in civic life. Nearly half of nonvoters in the most recent election said their personal dislike of politics played at least a minor role in their decision not to vote.\" The Pew chart highlights how widespread is this belief among nonvoters:\n\nNonvoters, despite their large numbers, are rarely discussed in mainstream U.S. precincts. In part that is because national media figures in cable news and Washington are overwhelmingly affluent and have little connection to or interest in them.\n\nBut in large part, that omission is explained by the fact that interrogating why so many millions of Americans choose not to vote would force the political and media class to grapple with the reason for this choice: Namely, the widespread perception that the political process and the two major parties are fundamentally corrupted and indifferent to all but a small sliver of privileged people. Confronting that problem and being forced to address it is far more difficult than creating a pleasant fiction that falsely maintains that people who abstain from voting do so because of selfish, amoral racial and class privilege.\n\nIn those few instances when nonvoters are honestly examined by large media outlets, a much different picture emerges than the one typically disseminated by affluent media stars and D.C. political operatives. One of the best and most thoughtful articles was a New York Times survey of African Americans in Milwaukee who chose not to vote in the 2016 election and, even knowing that it helped Trump win Wisconsin and thus the presidency, did not regret it.\n\nThe Times explained that \"the [2016] election was notable as much for the people who did not show up, as for those who did. Nationally, about half of eligible voters did not cast ballots.\" Wisconsin had its lowest turnout in 16 years. The Times added:\n\nMilwaukee's lowest-income neighborhoods offer one explanation for the turnout figures. Of the city's 15 council districts , the decline in turnout from 2012 to 2016 in the five poorest was consistently much greater than the drop seen in more prosperous areas - accounting for half of the overall decline in turnout citywide.\n\nThe interviews the paper conducted with African Americans and other poor residents of Milwaukee who chose not to vote were illuminating. They overwhelmingly said they did not regret their choice, even knowing Trump won, because they do not believe that the outcome of elections improves their lives, and do not believe that a victory by the Democratic Party would be meaningful for them. One Milwaukee barber, Cedric Fleming, said in a quote that was representative of the survey: \"I don't feel bad. Milwaukee is tired. Both of them [Clinton and Trump] were terrible. They never do anything for us anyway.\"\n\nThe Times quoted another Milwaukee barber as follows:\n\n\"I'm so numb,\" said Jahn Toney, 45, who had written in Mr. Sanders. He said no president in his lifetime had done anything to improve the lives of black people, including Mr. Obama, whom he voted for twice. \"It's like I should have known this would happen. We're worse off than before.\"\n\nThat rationale for nonvoting - \"both of them were terrible. They never do anything for us anyway\" - is typically cast by media personalities and Washington operatives as the province of rich, white, privileged leftists. But that claim is a lie. The data makes overwhelmingly clear that those who make that choice are often those with the least amount of privilege who believe, with good reason, that both parties and the political process generally are constructed to have no interest in improving their lives.\n\nIt is crucial to understand who nonvoters are, and what their motives are for choosing to abstain, not only to prevent media figures and D.C. operatives from disseminating disinformation, but also because that understanding highlights what kinds of candidates can motivate the millions of nonvoters to go to the polls. As the New York Times' Nate Cohn explained, the candidates most closely associated with the status quo are ones most likely to drive voters away from the polls, while those who appear to be outsiders who intend to deviate from bipartisan consensus are most likely to motivate them. That's why Sanders, in 2019, had the greatest appeal among nonvoters when he was perceived as something other than a traditional Democrat:\n\nWhen it comes to the candidates, Mr. Sanders shows relative strength among nonvoters: He has a 41 percent \"very favorable\" rating in the group, compared with 33 percent for Mr. Biden and 30 percent for Ms. Warren. This is at least in part because of Mr. Sanders's longtime appeal to young voters.\n\nNot only is Mr. Sanders's favorability rating the best of these three candidates, but he is also the only Democrat whose favorability rating is stronger among nonvoting Democratic leaners than among those who have voted before. His outsider status and promise of fundamental change, without much focus on cultural issues, might offer at least one clue for how Democrats might appeal to these nonvoters, though it need not be the only one.\n\nPolling already indicates that Joe Biden faces a serious problem whereby even his supporters - to say nothing of nonvoters - have extremely low enthusiasm for his candidacy . He could certainly win, but it will not be because he motivates large numbers of nonvoters to go the polls.\n\nWhatever else is true, those who make the choice to abstain from voting in presidential and midterm elections are overwhelmingly anything but \"privileged.\" The claim that they are is deliberate disinformation spread by the political and media elite class to suppress the reality of their own systemic failures when it comes to serving the needs of the vast majority of the population and to try to shame, rather than persuade, disaffected people to vote for their candidate.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Supreme Court: Affirmative Action Is OK - If the Students Are Getting Sent to Die in Wars\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nBy making an exception for military academies - and legacy admissions - the court once again sided with the ruling class.\n\nAffirmative action supporters and counterprotesters shout at each outside of the Supreme Court on June 29, 2023, in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn what is being described as a victory for a merit-based and colorblind approach to college admissions, the Supreme Court Thursday struck down affirmative action as a tool to redress race-based inequalities. The ruling by the court's conservative majority dealt with affirmative action programs at Harvard University and the University of North Carolina, but would apply across the country.\n\nThe precedent set by the court's decision is primed to transform college admissions standards around the country, yet there is one area where the law mandating diversity in recruitment is remaining conspicuously unchanged: U.S. military academies.\n\nWhen it comes to national priorities, the defense establishment has long been treated with kid gloves and afforded its own perks and protections. Think of the way fiscal hawks on both sides of the aisle regularly greenlight bloated Pentagon budgets. The divergence on diversity guidelines for elite colleges and U.S. military institutions stands out for its gross irony, not least because the most pernicious forms of affirmative action - those which protect the ruling class - remain untouched.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\n\"The Court has come to rest on the bottom-line conclusion that racial diversity in higher education is only worth potentially preserving insofar as it might be needed to prepare Black Americans and other underrepresented minorities for success in the bunker, not the boardroom,\" Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote in a dissenting opinion.\n\nA quick look at the details of the ruling itself sheds some light on the problem. The U.S. government had previously filed an amicus brief in the lawsuit asking for an exception for military academies. That brief stated that U.S. military leaders \"have learned through hard experience that the effectiveness of our military depends on a diverse officer corps that is ready to lead an increasingly diverse fighting force.\" Although the court rejected the same logic being applied to elite colleges, it evidently accepted the need for diversity among future generations of West Point graduates, stating in a footnote to the majority opinion that:\n\nThe United States as amicus curiae contends that race-based admissions programs further compelling interests at our Nation's military academies. No military academy is a party to these cases, however, and none of the courts below addressed the propriety of race-based admissions systems in that context. This opinion also does not address the issue, in light of the potentially distinct interests that military academies may present.\n\nA common criticism of affirmative action programs at universities is that they undermine merit as a primary criterion for selection. Yet the same concern seems equally, if not more, relevant to U.S. military leadership, particularly given the strong emphasis on national security normally espoused by U.S. politicians and the electorate.\n\nThe court is apparently hesitant to prioritize demographic diversity in admissions to colleges that, ultimately, determine the future appearance of the country's elite. But the same concerns do not seem to apply to the military, where one of the possibilities of membership, rather than joining the gilded class, is being severely injured or killed in one of the U.S.'s many foreign military conflicts.\n\nDespite the court's ruling, which has been widely celebrated among opponents of affirmative action, it is not entirely clear how much that the composition of elite colleges will change. The decision says that universities may continue to consider in admissions \"an applicant's discussion of how race affected his or her life, be it through discrimination, inspiration or otherwise.\"\n\nThis apparent loophole potentially allows applicants to continue to be accepted on the basis of racial background, provided they also give a personal statement about their race that could easily become de rigueur in the future.\n\nThe far more pervasive form of elite affirmative action - embodied by preferential treatment for legacy admissions, the children of financial donors, athletes, and relatives of school staff - was left untouched by the court ruling. The oversight is a significant one.\n\nThere was, however, one mention of it: In his concurring opinion, Justice Neil Gorsuch chastised elite schools like Harvard for their attempts to uphold affirmative action while continuing to defend legacy admissions. Harvard's \"preferences for the children of donors, alumni, and faculty are no help to applicants who cannot boast of their parents' good fortune or trips to the alumni tent all their lives,\" he wrote.\n\nNonetheless, a 2019 study found that a whopping 43 percent of white students at Harvard were beneficiaries of one of these forms of preferential access. While 70 percent of legacy admissions were white, only 16 percent of Black, Latino, and Asian students benefitted from these preferential considerations.\n\nIn effect, while rolling back affirmative action, the court left unscathed a backdoor means of demographic engineering in college admissions that is equally indifferent to merit as a criterion.\n\nThe reversal of affirmative action at elite schools will likely have reverberations well beyond the institutions themselves, including downstream changes in the internal culture of workforces and non-governmental institutions that had been encouraged for years to make demographic diversity a priority in hiring.\n\nYet the apparent inconsistencies in the ruling, including carve-outs for the military and continued preferential treatment for the wealthy and well connected, will likely make the decision a bitter one for many who had supported affirmative action to address America's history of racial inequity.\n\nIn her dissent to the ruling, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor said that the military exemption in particular \"highlights the arbitrariness\" of the court's decision. Sotomayor minced few words in expressing the depths of her objections to the ruling, which will likely be a landmark one in the history of America's post-civil rights legal movement.\n\n\"When proponents of those arguments, greater now in number on the Court, return to fight old battles anew, it betrays an unrestrained disregard for precedent,\" Sotomayor wrote in her dissent. \"It fosters the people's suspicions that 'bedrock principles are founded ... in the proclivities of individuals' on this Court, not in the law, and it degrades 'the integrity of our constitutional system of government.'\"\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "Beware the Race Reductionist\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nIn the debates over the proper role of identity politics, efforts to use identity to derail class-based projects have been widely overlooked.\n\nA hostage situation has emerged on the left. And progressive policies like \"Medicare for All,\" a $15 minimum wage, free public education, a \"Green New Deal,\" and even net neutrality , are the captives.\n\nThe captors? Bad-faith claims of bigotry.\n\nAccording to an increasingly popular narrative among the center-left, a dispiriting plurality of progressives are \"class reductionists\" - people who believe that economic equality is a cure-all for societal ills, and who, as a result, would neglect policy prescriptions which seek to remedy identity-based disparities.\n\nOf course, race and class are so interwoven that any political project that aims to resolve one while ignoring the other does a disservice to both. As Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., presumptive leader of the progressive movement, put it this spring when I asked him about the never-ending race versus class debates: \"It's not either-or. It's never either-or. It's both.\"\n\nThe fear that identity-based issues might be \"thrown under the bus\" in favor of more populist, \"universal\" policies is legitimate: The Democratic Party has certainly done as much in the recent past for causes less noble than class equality. But the irony is that anxiety over class reductionism has led some to defensively embrace an equally unproductive and regressive ideology: race reductionism.\n\nIf you're #online, like I am, you're probably already familiar with the main argument. It goes something like this: If a policy doesn't resolve racism \"first,\" it's at worst, racist and at best, not worth pursuing.\n\nAccording to one popular iteration of this theme, \"Medicare for All\" is presumptively racist or sexist because it won't eliminate discriminatory point-of-service care or fully address women's reproductive needs if it's not thoughtfully designed. Perhaps you remember Rep. James Clyburn's claim that a free college and university plan would \" destroy \" historically black colleges and universities. Maybe you've heard that the minimum wage is \"racist\" because it \" Kills Jobs and Doesn't Help the Poor , \" or that it's an act of privilege to care about Wall Street corruption, because only the wealthy could possibly mind what the banks do with the mortgages and pensions of millions of Americans. Perchance you've even been pitched on the incredible notion that rooftop solar panels hurt minority communities .\n\nLibertarian journalist Conor Friedersdorf recently entered the fray with a piece titled, \"Democratic Socialism Threatens Minorities.\" His argument? That \"top-down socialism\" (which progressives want just about as badly as they want top-down capitalism) would create a tyranny of the majority and put minorities at risk. Completely ignoring the market failures of our current system, and eliding the widespread prejudice and violence black Americans face under capitalism, he concern-trolls by imagining a world in which black women struggle to find suitable hair products. Of course, this is a world we already live in .\n\nFriedersdorf, though, was merely building an addition on a house of cards first constructed by Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential primary campaign: \"If we broke up the big banks tomorrow,\" she famously asked, \"would that end racism? Would that end sexism? Would that end discrimination against the LGBT community? Would that make people feel more welcoming to immigrants overnight?\"\n\nIt was a daring and adroit deception: Ignore this structural salve that would upset the status quo, she implied , because it won't resolve that more personal, more visceral issue which goes straight to the heart of your identity.\n\nNotice that this trick is aimed at policies which would threaten significant corporate or entrenched interests: the insurance industry, the banking industry, the energy sector, lenders. As the University of California, Berkeley, law professor and leading scholar on race Ian Haney-L ó pez observed as we discussed the motives behind this framing, mainstream Democrats, like Republicans, \"are funded by large donors. Of course they're concerned about the interests of the top 1 percent.\" It's almost as if the real agenda here isn't ending racism, but deterring well-meaning liberals from policies that would upset the Democratic Party's financial base.\n\nThe cruel irony is that, as much as it wouldn't have ended racism, breaking up the banks and properly regulating them would have a positive effect on the economic, and consequently, the social status of black and Hispanic Americans. Banks, left to their own devices, systematically give blacks worse loans with higher interest rates than whites with worse credit histories. Yet there was little talk of those racial impacts when, this spring, 33 Democrats - including nine Congressional Black Caucus members - joined with Republicans to roll back protections contained in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act.\n\nAfrican-Americans are disproportionately victimized by predatory lending, and as a result, we were among the worst affected by the 2008 housing crisis (from which the bottom still hasn't recovered ). Of course, the goal of breaking up banks was to avoid a repeat of the collapse which wiped out 40 percent of black wealth - hardly an incidental issue to African-Americans, who rank the economy, jobs, health care, and poverty above race relations when asked to rate our chief political concerns.\n\nClyburn's claim that free college and university would \"kill\" historically black colleges is similarly a misdirection. HBCUs are facing a funding squeeze and might suffer somewhat if tuition-paying applicants go elsewhere. But Clyburn's defense of black institutions ignores that black students have the most to gain from college debt relief.\n\nAlthough there is a black-white college graduation gap, black Americans actually apply to and enroll in college at higher rates than white Americans. Why don't we matriculate? An inability to pay ranks high among the reasons. And black students carry a disproportionate amount of scholastic debt - more than any other group. The idea that free college would hurt HBCUs is intended to suggest it's \"bad for blacks,\" and therefore regressive (or even racist). Given that the opposite is true, it would be easy to interpret Clyburn's spin as cynical politicking against the interests of the very community he's presumed to faithfully represent. Affording him the benefit of the doubt earned by his storied legacy of advocacy for the black community, his comments were, at best, a mistake.\n\nMoreover, although immigration is coded as the \"Hispanic issue\" by the media, only 1 in 10 Latinos are undocumented, while 1 in 3 non-elderly Hispanics are uninsured - that's the largest uninsured demographic group in the country.\n\nOver-policing is a critical issue, but while approximately 1 in 6 blacks will be incarcerated in our lifetimes, 1 in 4 non-elderly black Americans is uninsured - that's compared to 13 percent of non-Hispanic white Americans. Even the Black Lives Matter platform, which calls for universal health care , recognizes that health care is not a peripheral issue, but an existential one for black Americans. The reason it's not perceived as a \"person of color issue\" is a matter of marketing, not substance.\n\nSo will \"Medicare for All\" cure racism ? No. Will it completely eliminate point-of-care discrimination ? It won't. But neither will doubling down on the status quo. Those who admonish these broad economic policies on the grounds that they won't end bigotry rarely, if ever, propose alternatives that will; nor do they suggest reforms to make flawed universal programs more perfect. This fact, more than anything, exposes the bad faith motives of at least some race reductionists.\n\nOur Revolution president and former Bernie Sanders surrogate Nina Turner described race reductionism as \"ludicrous.\" \"Identity can be used in a positive way to say, 'Hey, we must recognize that there's an undergirding concern across all issues in this country,'\" for which race is a \"major variable,\" she told me. \"But it is entirely another different story to say we're going to use some of the most progressive ideas and advancements in this country and say we can't do them because they hurt [marginalized people]. To me, it's just asinine.\"\n\nShe's right. Crowds in front of the Lincoln Memorial during the March for Jobs and Freedom, also known as the March on Washington, Aug. 28, 1963. AP It was not always this way. Before the 1980s, the party of the left was the party of labor, and the civil rights movements of the 1950s, '60s, and '70s were inextricably linked to class. A. Philip Randolph and Bayard Rustin collaborated on the 1966 \" Freedom Budget for All Americans ,\" which attacked black poverty by addressing its source: a paucity of well-paying jobs for low-skilled workers. Colloquially described as the March on Washington, the historic rally's official name was the March for Jobs and Freedom. And five years later, Martin Luther King Jr. was famously murdered after declaring a war on poverty and U.S. imperialism - far-reaching and institutionally threatening movements that implicated not just how resources were distributed across racial lines, but the legitimacy of our capitalist economic system itself.\n\nCrowds in front of the Lincoln Memorial during the March for Jobs and Freedom, also known as the March on Washington, Aug. 28, 1963.\n\nBut those days are behind us, killed by corporate interests who feared the people's momentum and derived a strategy to defeat it. Attacks on labor laws gutted unions just as people of color were gaining access to them and reaping incredible benefits from collective action. And following the embarrassing loss of George McGovern in the 1972 presidential election, the Democratic Party committed to corporations as a more reliable source of support. After all, with the right staking out their claim as pro-white so clearly, where did the more melanated \"base\" have to go ?\n\nWhen Republicans pivoted to the Southern strategy in the 1960s - uniting rich and poor whites on the premise that they'd always have racial superiority - the Democrats positioned their party as a refuge for everyone else. Identity, consequently, has become centrally important to liberals. It's not just a useful way to frame experiences which stem from broadly shared characteristics, nor is its political relevance limited to its significant organizing value. Today, identities other than white, cis, straight, and male are foundational to the Democratic Party's understanding of itself and its ability to persist. Like the clumsy signifier \"people of color,\" the party defines itself via its relationship to a white male status quo. The coalition, by its very nature, depends on it.\n\nNo wonder, then, that identity has become such a lightning rod and critiques of identity politics are so polarizing.\n\nJust look at presumed 2020 hopeful Sen. Kamala Harris's recent defense of identity politics at the Netroots conference earlier this month.\n\nSeeming to either misunderstand or ignore the critique of identity politics from the left , she argued that the term \"identity politics\" is used to \"divide and it is used to distract. Its purpose is to minimize and marginalize issues that impact all of us.\" \"It is used to try to shut us up,\" she said.\n\nThis is certainly true of the political right , which generally rejects identity politics because acknowledging its validity would require them to admit that identities are politicized in response to systemic oppression ( which they deny is real ), rather than a rejection of individualism.\n\nBut the left's critique of identity politics is not really a critique of identity politics at all, but of the cynical weaponization of identity for political ends. By conflating the two, Harris managed to delegitimize the left's critique, and strengthen the Democratic Party's ability to continue to weaponize identity with impunity - whether or not that was her intent.\n\nHarris averred that she wouldn't be dissuaded from talking about immigrant rights, women's rights, equal justice, or other concerns relating to marginalized groups. Nor should she. But I suspect that this shoring up of identity politics is not just a defense against attacks on substantive equality from the right. It's preparation for a war against leftist candidates sure to enter the ring in 2020.\n\nThe root of why some Democrats have adopted this approach feels obvious. Faced with a challenge from the left, the Democratic Party's usual tactic of comparing itself favorably to Republicans , doesn't work. Where the establishment offered a $12 minimum wage in 2016, Bernie Sanders argued that $15 was better. When Hillary Clinton sought to protect the ACA, Sanders said it didn't go far enough. The growing popularity of left movements among black people prompted the Ku Klux Klan to use the threat of violence to deter blacks from communist meetings, as evidenced by this flyer from the 1930s. Images: Alabama Department of Archives and History In her 2017 book \"What Happened,\" Clinton was explicit about how frustrating she found running against Sanders to be:\n\nThe growing popularity of left movements among black people prompted the Ku Klux Klan to use the threat of violence to deter blacks from communist meetings, as evidenced by this flyer from the 1930s.\n\nJake Sullivan, my top policy advisor, told me it reminded him of a scene from the 1998 movie There's Something About Mary . A deranged hitchhiker says he's come up with a brilliant plan. Instead of the famous \"eight-minute abs\" exercise routine, he's going to market \"seven-minute abs.\" It's the same, just quicker. Then the driver, played by Ben Stiller, says, \"Well, why not six-minute abs?\" That's what it was like in policy debates with Bernie. We would propose a bold infrastructure investment plan or an ambitious new apprenticeship program for young people, and then Bernie would announce basically the same thing, but bigger.\n\nToday, most 2020 hopefuls seem to have responded to the popularity of the progressive movement by simply embracing many of its policy prescriptions. (They kind of have to: \"Medicare for All\" has gone from something that Clinton insisted would \"never, ever\" happen, to a policy which has the backing of a majority of the American public - including Republicans .)\n\nBut some still employ a mixed strategy, which pairs a shift to the left with an attack on progressivism under the pretext of anti-bigotry. This needs to end, before it ends badly. The organization Progressive Democrats of America holds a news conference to announce the launch of a Medicare for All Caucus at the Capitol on July 19, 2018. Photo: Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call via AP Now, the concern that broad-based material policies will replicate, reinforce, or worsen patterns of discrimination is legitimate. It is true that in the past, \"universal\" programs have been distributed in an inequitable and, at times, racist manner.\n\nThe organization Progressive Democrats of America holds a news conference to announce the launch of a Medicare for All Caucus at the Capitol on July 19, 2018.\n\nBut that's not a reason to forestall initiatives aimed at economic equality until some far off time at which racism is cured. Rather, it's incentive to improve upon them.\n\nRhiana Gunn-Wright, the policy director for former Michigan gubernatorial candidate Dr. Abdul El-Sayed and the brains behind his comprehensive suite of policy proposals, understands this. In a recent interview , she explained that she takes an \"intersectional\" approach to policy - a reference to Columbia University law professor Kimberl é Crenshaw's insight that identities intersect, overlap, and diversify the priorities of individuals within broad identity-group categories.\n\nGunn-Wright believes that \"universal\" programs are rightly criticized when they adopt a rising-tide-raises-all-ships philosophy, which can ignore or reinforce disparities across groups. But she says that policymakers can work to avoid that outcome. \"The analysis of intersectionality was all about how systems are designed with either a deep inattention to all identities or attention to one identity at a time, and therefore ignoring people who lived at the intersections of those identities,\" she told me. But that's a design problem - not an argument against broad economic programs.\n\n\"I think it's very interesting intersectionality has become such a buzzword now, and you can tell a lot of people have picked it up without ever reading the black women who created the concept,\" Gunn-Wright said. \"I can never imagine Kimberl é Crenshaw being like: 'You know what? We definitely should not have single payer until we figure out race.'\"\n\nNo identity should ever be sidelined. As Haney-López told me, \"There's a danger to thinking exclusively in race terms. But you kind of want to be balanced about what that danger is and how it relates to dominant political dynamics and what the resolution is, because at the same time that there's a risk to talking about race, there's an enormous risk to erasing it.\" He's right. But while I understand where concerns about \"de-centering\" race are coming from, by definition, there is no fixed \"center\" in intersectionality. It's not a zero-sum game.\n\n\"We think that race, in particular, is a purely social issue and not connected to economics or reproductive justice or criminal justice,\" said Gunn-Wright, arguing that, in fact, both class and race are always part of the equation. \"I think identities are incredibly important and shape the way we move throughout the world, and they shape the way that people treat us and the way our government treats us. ... It's just been deployed in this way that shuts down progress instead of embracing it, and also assumes in a very strange way that black people wouldn't want this sort of progress, or wouldn't benefit from it.\"\n\nTour é Reed, professor of 20th century U.S. and African-American history at Illinois State University, observed that the presumption that black Americans aren't equally or more invested in economic interventions as white Americans is \"pregnant, of course, with class presumptions,\" which work well for the black and Latinx professional middle class - many of whom play a significant role in defining public narratives via their work in politics or media. Since \"the principal beneficiaries of universal policies would be poor and working-class people who would disproportionately be black and brown,\" he told me, \"dismissing such policies on the grounds that they aren't addressing systemic racism is a sleight of hand of sorts.\"\n\nIntersectionality, the \"buzzword\" taken up so faithfully by mainstream Democrats in 2016, requires an acknowledgment that like race and sexual identity, class is a dimension that mediates one's perspective. That means t he hashtag #trustblackwomen shouldn't collapse the interests of Oprah, a billionaire, with, well, anyone else's . Similarly, not all blacks or Latinos should be presumed to speak equally to the interests of poor and working-class people of color. This is a truth easily internalized when Democrats consider figures like Ben Carson or Ted Cruz. It's a more difficult reality to swallow when considering one of our own .\n\nNone of this is to say that in every scenario, race, gender, sexuality, and class are equal inputs. Affluent black athletes are still tackled by cops despite their wealth, and black Harvard professors are arrested trying to unlock their own front doors. But the fact that racism hurts even those with economic privilege is not \"proof\" that class doesn't matter, as some race reductionists have claimed. It's simply affirmation that racism matters too.\n\nConsider, for instance, my colleague Zaid Jilani's review of comprehensive police shooting data in 2015, in which he found that 95 percent of police shootings had occurred in neighborhoods where the household income averaged below $100,000 a year. Remember that Philando Castile was pulled over, in part, because he was flagged for dozens of driving offenses described as \" crimes of poverty \" by local public defender Erik Sandvick. Failure to show proof of insurance, driving with a broken taillight - these are hardly patrician slip-ups. If anything is privileged, it's the fiction that there's no difference between the abuses suffered by wealthy black athletes and working-class blacks like Castile. Race can increase your odds of being targeted and abused. Money can help you survive abuse and secure justice - something which sadly eluded Castile .\n\n\"There is a tendency to reduce issues that have quite a bit to do with the economic opportunities available to all Americans, African-Americans among them, and in some instances overrepresented among them, to matters of race,\" explained Reed, who is currently writing a book on the conservative implications of race reductionism. He pointed to the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, as well as the mass incarceration crisis, as examples. \"In both those instances, Flint and the criminal justice system, whites are 40 percent, or near 40 percent, of the victims,\" he said. \"And that's an awfully high number for collateral damage.\" He went on: \"There's something systemic at play. But it can't be reduced, be reducible, to race.\"\n\nAbout a month ago, in anticipation of writing this, I asked Twitter to remind me of any tweets or articles that had unfairly framed progressive policies as negative because they would not end bigotry. I expected maybe a dozen responses. But that thread is now at over 200 posts, and has been retweeted over 2,000 times. The scale of this is unnerving.\n\nSally Albright, a Democratic Party communications consultant, argues often that free college is \"racist\" because mostly white people go to college and it reinforces the status quo.\n\nSenior Legal Analyst at Rewire News and popular Twitter personality Imani Gandy suggested to her 124,000 followers that caring about Wall Street is evidence of white privilege, writing: \"I would love to wake up in the morning and have my first thought be 'I hate Wall Street.' That's the whitest thing I've ever heard.\"\n\nIn a similar vein, DeRay Mckesson, popular podcaster, charter school advocate, and Black Lives Matter icon, retweeted a tweet which read: \"Wall Street didn't nominate a Sec of Education that believed guns and bibles have more place in schools than LGBT and disabled students,\" implying that because Wall Street isn't to blame for anti-LGBT policies, the financial industry doesn't merit critique from black and/or LGBT Americans at all.\n\nWhen someone pointed out that New York Times columnist Charles Blow shouldn't be uncomfortable with a 50-plus percent tax rate for rich because taxes were even higher in the New Deal era, Blow tweeted back: \"You can feel free to return to the 30s. Wasn't so great for my folks\" - as though a high tax rate necessitates a return to Jim Crow terrorism.\n\nAn anonymous, but popular, Twitter personality disparaged a job guarantee program because black people \"had 100% employment for 250 years,\" meaning slavery, and it \"didn't help\" racism.\n\nIn a Vice article , Monica Potts claims to support single-payer health care while cautioning against Sanders's plan on the basis that it would destroy jobs worked by low-income women - never mind that it would provide those women with health care they disproportionately lack. (Her point that any job-eliminating programs would cause less harm if a strong social safety net were in place is a sound one, but it ignores that Sanders's plan is being proposed in conjunction with exactly the types of social safety net fortifications she seeks.)\n\nTerrell Jermaine Starr, a journalist at The Root with a history of writing articles on the theme of Sanders's alleged black problem, wrote a begrudging acknowledgment of the senator's new bill addressing the inequities of cash bail in a piece ungenerously titled: \"Bernie Sanders Takes on Unjust Cash Bail System, but Still Doesn't Make Direct Connection to Institutional Racism.\"\n\nSally Albright distilled the essence of this dominant strain of criticism when she tweeted: \"Sorry kids, no way around it, if you say a policy 'helps all Americans equally,' that policy is racist. Structural racism must be addressed.\"\n\nWe're independent of corporate interests - and powered by members. Join us. Become a member Join Our Newsletter Thank You For Joining! Original reporting.

The anonymous Twitter user who argued that we have to maintain capitalism because \"Ending capitalism WILL displace people of color. Money is what keeps us in the game,\" or Sally Albright's tweet that \"Income inequality is only a priority for cis white men,\" ultimately don't matter. But I'm concerned that the growing popularity of this framing will make it that much easier for politicians to exploit the left's good faith concern about identity-based disparities in order to disperse enthusiasm for policies that seek to transform the economic status quo.\n\nEnding racism is a necessary, critical goal. But that goal should be pursued in tandem with efforts to address the effects of racism. The wage gap, the health care gap, the education gap, the debt gap - all these disparities would be narrowed by progressive, intersectional economic programs. As popular opinion coalesces around these policies, it's crucial that we not let our best impulses be weaponized against our interests, any more than conservatives weaponize the worst impulses of their constituents against theirs.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "FCC's New Diversity Chair Lobbied Against Net Neutrality and Services for Minority Communities\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nJulia Johnson says she represents a diverse community, but she actually serves the telecom industry.\n\nFederal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai has selected Julia Johnson, president of a consulting firm called NetCommunications, to lead the Advisory Committee on Diversity and Digital Empowerment, a group Pai said he established to champion the voice of every American, \"no matter their race, gender, religion, ethnicity, or sexual orientation.\"\n\nDespite the laudatory title and mission of the diversity committee, Johnson is a consultant who perfectly embodies the corporations-first agenda of President Donald Trump's FCC.\n\nJohnson has long worked on behalf of industry groups seeking to undermine consumer regulations and promote the interests of large corporate clients.\n\nShortly after Trump named Pai to lead the FCC, the Multicultural Media, Telecom & Internet Council - a nonprofit chaired by Johnson and funded by Comcast, AT&T, Verizon, and other large telecom firms - released statements praising Pai's appointment and endorsing his strategy for unwinding the net neutrality protections secured during former President Barack Obama's administration.\n\nMMTC's pro-Trump administration statements , cast as being made on behalf of communities of color, are typical of Johnson's approach. Over the years, Johnson has used racial minorities as a cudgel to disingenuously lobby on behalf of industry.\n\nFor instance, as The Intercept previously reported , a news website created by Johnson's consulting firm, Politic365, worked aggressively to slam the idea of \"net metering,\" which allows homeowners to claim credit for the solar electricity they generate and send back to the utility grid. Politic365 published multiple pieces sharply criticizing the rule, claiming that the metering would somehow harm African-American consumers and would simply benefit \" privileged \" elites. Those claims directly contradict findings by independent analysts, especially those working in communities of color on renewable and green job initiatives. What's more, while Politic365 led the anti-net metering effort, it did not disclose that Johnson was paid by the utility firms opposed to net metering, including FirstEnergy and NorthWestern Energy.\n\nJohnson's history of \"astroturfing,\" a term for lobbying using fake grassroots groups, goes back more than a decade. During congressional testimony in 2006, Johnson was unmasked for lobbying against minorities on behalf of the telecom industry. Then-Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., asked Johnson why her organization, a group she formed called the Video Access Alliance, appeared to oppose a requirement of a bill that would force telephone companies to \" build out \" services to poor and minority neighborhoods.\n\nThe question led to a fairly unusual exchange, with Johnson finally admitting that she was consulting for the same telephone industry interests that had also resisted the build-out mandate:\n\nMarkey: Is your organization financially supported by the Bell [telephone] companies in any way?\n\nJohnson: No, we're not.\n\nMarkey: At all.\n\nJohnson: Yes, and let me elaborate upon that too. We're a relatively new organization.\n\nMarkey: No, that's OK. I can go along with that answer. That's fine. Thank you. And are you compensated in any way by the Bell companies?\n\nJohnson: I have a consulting firm that works for a variety of companies, generally in the regulatory space.\n\nMarkey: But are the Bell companies amongst those companies that pay you?\n\nJohnson: Yes.\n\nWatch here:\n\nJohnson's appointment to the FCC's diversity board has been celebrated by none other than Politic365. In a news item that does not mention Johnson's connection to Politics365, the website notes that many of Johnson's colleagues from her group, MMTC, have also joined Pai's diversity effort, and that their first meeting will take place on September 25.\n\nTop photo: FCC Chairman Ajit Pai speaks during the 2017 NAB Show at the Las Vegas Convention Center on April 25, 2017, in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Surveillance Debate Gets a Needed Dose of Racial Perspective\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\n\"The Color of Surveillance\" conference focuses on the relationship between government spying and the overly aggressive policing of minorities.\n\nALVARO BEDOYA HAS been working on surveillance, privacy, and technology in Washington for years now. Before founding Georgetown Law's Center on Privacy & Technology , he served as chief counsel to Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., and the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law.\n\nBut as surveillance became a major national issue thanks to NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, Bedoya saw something disturbing amid the Washington wonkery: a huge gulf between the discussions of government spying, on the one hand, and aggressive policing tactics in minority communities on the other.\n\nAlvaro Bedoya. Photo: Twitter \"We're having these two separate debates that are running in parallel and never intersecting,\" Bedoya explains. \"There's no recognition that those issues constantly overlap. The level of policing of the black community is facilitated by the surveillance laws and surveillance technology developed for the war on terror.\"\n\nAlvaro Bedoya.\n\nToday's much anticipated all-day conference, \" The Color of Surveillance: Government Monitoring of the African American Community ,\" is an attempt to bridge the gulf. The conference, organized by Bedoya and Georgetown Law professor Paul Butler, runs from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, and is being live streamed here , hashtag #ColorofSurveillance .\n\nIn January, Bedoya wrote an essay in Slate exploring the history of FBI surveillance of activists and people of color, using the example of Martin Luther King Jr., and how those practices have advanced with technology.\n\nSimilarly, the conference will start with the history of surveillance reaching all the way back to the days of slavery and plantations, when policies like lantern laws, enacted in the 18th century, forced black, mixed race, and other enslaved people to carry a light at night to identify themselves.\n\nThe timeline will then jump to World Word I, W.E.B. Du Bois, and the \"negro subversion\" division of military intelligence, which was formed to spy on black activists. Then, attendees will hear about Martin Luther King Jr. and the days of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover and his COINTELPRO program focused on monitoring of social and political activists.\n\nPresentations from the present day, Bedoya says, will focus on developments since the September 11 attacks, and the expansion of the government's overall spying power at home and abroad.\n\nSpeakers include Freddy Martinez of Lucy Parson Labs, who recently won a lawsuit against the Chicago Police Department to disclose documents on the city's use of Stingray technology, which mimics a cellphone tower in order to grab up information about nearby cellphones. For the past year, he and his colleagues have been working on a project tracking how the city has used money from civil forfeitures and the war on drugs to fund its expensive surveillance equipment.\n\nHamid Khan will speak about the architecture of surveillance in Los Angeles, where his grassroots Stop LAPD Spying Coalition works on exposing and eliminating the police department's aggressive use of predictive policing, data gathering, and technology to track and criminalize homeless, poor, and minority communities.\n\nBrandi Collins, representing the Color of Change, is expected to speak about her work pushing the government to reveal the extent of the Department of Homeland Security's monitoring of Black Lives Matter activists, while Boston University researcher Khiara Bridges will talk about her research on pregnant women in New York on Medicaid whose entire lives are exposed by invasive questioning, unlike wealthy women who can afford private health care.\n\nFinally, Bedoya says he wants to turn the tables on technology being framed as a tool to spy reserved for the government.\n\n\"I don't want to have the narrative that technology is just a tool of oppression. It empowers communities to watch back,\" he says, describing an application that allows citizens to track their interactions with police.\n\nRelated:\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Race Neutral\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nNorth Carolina Appeals Courts Have Never Found That Prosecutors Discriminated Against Black Jurors. Two Cases Could Change That.\n\nIn partnership with\n\nE ven before Dorian Hamilton arrived at the Wake County Justice Center for jury duty on January 10, 2017, she told friends and family how much she wanted to serve. \"They said I was crazy,\" Hamilton recalled. \"They were like, 'You know you don't get paid?' And I was like, 'Oh yeah, I don't care.'\"\n\nHamilton, who is Black, moved to North Carolina nearly 20 years ago. Early on, she recognized that the racial dynamics were different than in Long Island, where she grew up. There, she never came across a Black judge, police officer, or teacher, she said. But in North Carolina, she saw more people of color - even a Black judge - and thought that there could be more racial justice. \"Maybe you aren't judged so much by color here,\" she thought. \"Maybe because there are more minorities here, maybe things are a little more fair.\"\n\nBy the time Hamilton was called for voir dire on the afternoon of January 24, she knew it was a high-profile capital case. Nathan Holden, a Black man, was accused of killing his in-laws and attempting to murder his former wife. Hamilton was told the trial could last several weeks, but she still sought to serve on the jury. She remembered being thoughtful in her answers to questions from the prosecutors, carefully avoiding saying anything that would give either side pause. She told prosecutors she owned a dance studio in Raleigh, worked part time as a realtor, and that serving on the jury wouldn't be a burden. She answered questions about her experiences with law enforcement, sharing that she once helped a police officer buy a home and also that an officer once pulled a gun on her for no good reason.\n\nWhen asked by Wake County Assistant District Attorney Matt Lively what effect this negative experience would have on her ability to judge an officer's credibility, Hamilton said, \"I don't think it would have an effect on me at all. Because just like people are good, there are bad.\"\n\nLively said he thought that was a \"good way to look at\" the experience and then, according to court records, proceeded to question Hamilton for an hour. He asked about her views regarding the death penalty, police violence, custody disputes, gun ownership, mental health, and implicit bias. Hamilton expressed decidedly balanced opinions on these issues - \"I do believe there are issues with police being overzealous sometimes, but if you see what they are dealing with, then sometimes it may be necessary,\" she said - but also said she was concerned that her fellow jurors might be biased against Holden because he is Black, wore dreadlocks, and was shackled when they saw him for the first time.\n\nLively then struck Hamilton from the jury, using what is known as a peremptory strike to dismiss her without cause. During jury selection in a criminal trial, potential jurors can be excused \"for cause\" when the judge finds that they cannot decide the case impartially. The defense and prosecution may also exercise a limited number of peremptory strikes to excuse jurors without offering a reason. Lively's strike of Hamilton didn't go unnoticed by Holden's attorneys Elizabeth Hambourger, from the Center for Death Penalty Litigation, and Jonathan Broun, from North Carolina Prisoner Legal Services. They had seen this happen before.\n\nHamilton, unsure what was going on, was asked to wait outside the courtroom. Hambourger, believing racial bias was at the heart of Hamilton's dismissal, challenged the strike under the 1986 U.S. Supreme Court decision Batson v. Kentucky , which North Carolina's criminal legal system has had trouble complying with for more than 35 years.\n\nElizabeth Hambourger poses for a portrait in front of the Supreme Court of North Carolina in downtown Raleigh, N.C., on Oct. 31, 2021.\n\nI n 1983, an all-white jury in Kentucky convicted James Batson, a Black man, of second-degree burglary and receipt of stolen goods. During jury selection, the prosecutor used peremptory challenges to strike all four Black people eligible for jury duty. When Batson's lawyer objected, claiming that his client's rights to an impartial jury and equal protection under the law were violated, the trial judge denied the motion.\n\nOn appeal, the Kentucky Supreme Court affirmed the trial court's decision, citing Swain v. Alabama , a 1965 U.S. Supreme Court decision requiring defendants to show that prosecutors systematically discriminated against potential Black jurors across cases - an incredibly high bar for proving purposeful discrimination. By the time Batson's case made it to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1985, few had ever won relief under Swain.\n\nBut in the spring of 1986, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the prosecutor's use of peremptory challenges at Batson's trial violated his rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments, reversing his conviction and reaffirming the notion that discrimination against nonwhite jury candidates was unconstitutional - but only if a judge found it to be purposeful.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nSince Batson, a three-step process for determining discriminatory intent requires prosecutors to justify each peremptory strike challenged by the defense with race-neutral reasons, a barrier Justice Thurgood Marshall predicted would be easy to overcome. \"Any prosecutor can easily assert facially neutral reasons for striking a juror, and trial courts are ill equipped to second-guess those reasons,\" Marshall wrote in his concurring opinion in Batson.\n\nIndeed, while some states claim progress, racial bias across the jury selection process has continued to be discovered decades after Batson. A 2015 study found that prosecutors in Caddo Parish, Louisiana, used peremptory strikes on Black potential jurors at three times the rate of non-Black jurors; Texas Monthly recently reported that a district clerk in Brazoria County used race to sort jury panels , which could result in the reversal of hundreds of convictions; and in the past year, the Queens, New York, DA's office vacated the convictions of three men based on evidence of racial discrimination during jury selection - the prosecutor had used handwritten notes reminding him to use his peremptory strikes to eliminate women and people of color. ( Among his notes : \"no Hispanics,\" \"get white jurors,\" and \"established whites.\")\n\nStill, trial courts around the country often fail to find Batson violations, and appellate courts often show their deference to those rulings. But North Carolina's Batson record is particularly poor. In 2009, the state enacted the Racial Justice Act , intended to prevent the execution of people whose trials were tainted by racial bias in jury selection or other types of racial discrimination. It provided people on death row with the opportunity to challenge their sentence if they could prove that race played a significant role in their trial, and if they won relief, their death sentence would be commuted to life in prison without parole. Republicans, fearing an end to the state death penalty, repealed the Racial Justice Act in 2013 and attempted to apply the move retroactively. In June 2020, however, the state's Supreme Court found that the retroactive use of the repeal was unconstitutional and restored the law's protections for people who filed claims before its repeal.\n\nThe necessity of the Racial Justice Act was demonstrated by a 2012 Michigan State University study of capital cases tried between 1990 and 2010, which found that prosecutors in North Carolina excluded Black jurors because of their race - 2.5 times more often than non-Black jurors.\n\nA 2016 University of North Carolina Law Review study marking the 30th anniversary of Batson found that the state's appellate courts had yet to find that a prosecutor who provided a race-neutral reason violated Batson in 114 cases involving nonwhite jurors. By contrast, Alabama appellate courts have found Batson violations 80 times.\n\n\"North Carolina is often billed as a racially moderate state compared to other southern states,\" H. Timothy Lovelace Jr., a law professor at Duke University, said. \"So in some ways it really is striking that state courts in North Carolina have historically been so reluctant to tackle the issue of jury discrimination.\"\n\nThat could soon change. North Carolina's Court of Appeals and Supreme Court are currently reconsidering Batson claims in the cases of two Black men from Forsyth County who have strong claims that prosecutors discriminated against Black jurors. If the appellate courts rule in their favor, the men will receive a new trial. The Batson claims in Holden's case will be reheard in trial court and could return to the Court of Appeals.\n\nDavid Weiss, an attorney in North Carolina who has represented people sentenced to death in appellate and post-conviction proceedings, said it was \"embarrassing\" that North Carolina appellate courts have yet to recognize discrimination against a Black juror. \"There's either two explanations for that. One, there's no race discrimination in North Carolina, or two, our courts have been doing something wrong for decades. I think that question kind of answers itself.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court of North Carolina is seen in downtown Raleigh, N.C., on Oct. 31, 2021.\n\nI n 1994, Russell Tucker walked out of a Super Kmart shopping center in Winston-Salem wearing a coat and a pair of boots he had just stolen, according to prosecutors. When store employees approached Tucker in the parking lot, Tucker shot at them, killing the store's security guard. Tucker ran but was soon met by two police officers in a patrol car. He fired five more shots, wounding both. He fled into some nearby woods and was caught within the hour.\n\nIn 1996, an all-white jury in Winston-Salem sentenced Tucker, who is Black, to death.\n\nOne of the prosecutors on Tucker's case, Forsyth County Assistant District Attorney Rob Lang, had previously been trained on how to get around Batson challenges. At \"Top Gun II,\" a program sponsored by the North Carolina Conference of District Attorneys, Lang received a worksheet titled \" Batson Justifications: Articulating Juror Negatives \" that provided 10 explanations prosecutors could use if a peremptory strike was challenged under Batson. Among them: \"inappropriate dress,\" defined as \"attire may show lack of respect for the system, immaturity or rebelliousness\"; \"body language\" (\"arms folded, leaning away from questioner, obvious boredom may show anti-prosecution tendencies\"); and \"attitude\" (\"air of defiance, lack of eye contact with Prosecutor, eye contact with defendant or defense attorney\").\n\nThe worksheet was not discovered until 2012, when lawyers for Errol Duke Moses, another Forsyth County man on death row, were given access to prosecutor files from a number of capital cases, including Tucker's. In 2019, the New York Times editorial board cited the worksheet when it wrote that North Carolina \"has long had one of the most racially biased criminal-justice systems in the country.\"\n\nWeiss, the North Carolina attorney, saw that the Batson worksheet was problematic early on, proof of prosecutors trying to \"game the system.\" But he later realized that it had even more troubling connotations: The justifications themselves were inherently racist.\n\n\"The idea that Black citizens who've reported for jury service are not sufficiently deferential to white prosecutors or are not making eye contact or don't look right to the prosecutor really have - you might say echoes, but in some ways - very direct parallels to earlier eras of very explicit racism when Black people were really expected to show deference to white people,\" Weiss said.\n\nNow the worksheet is at the center of Tucker's Batson claim in front of the North Carolina Supreme Court, which he brought under the Racial Justice Act. His attorneys from the Center for Death Penalty Litigation, Hambourger and Mark Pickett, claim the worksheet proves that Lang and his co-counsel David Spence intentionally struck Black jurors in his case. In a brief filed with the North Carolina Supreme Court in July , they challenged the prosecution's response to the Batson objections raised at trial. \"They claimed they struck Black jurors for being unregistered to vote, but accepted numerous white jurors who were likewise not registered,\" Hambourger and Pickett wrote of the trial prosecutors. \"They offered absurd reasons for striking Black jurors, for example, complaining that a Black juror was 'monosyllabic' when answering mostly yes-or-no questions.\"\n\nThe state argues that Tucker's claim is without merit and should be procedurally barred, even while conceding that there are problems with the Batson worksheet. The worksheet on its own is not proof of racial bias, argued North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein in a September court filing.\n\nLang, Spence, and a spokesperson for the North Carolina attorney general's office declined to comment, citing pending litigation. Oral arguments will likely be held in 2022.\n\n\"If prosecutors across the state happen to be coming up with reasons for striking overwhelmingly more Black jurors than white jurors, even if there's no hatred in their individual hearts when they do this, obviously there is a structural cause for that,\" Pickett said. \"There's no way this could just be happening by chance, that across all these trials, Black people keep getting removed at a much higher rate. It's a huge problem, and it's not just a problem for defendants. It's a tremendous problem that prosecutors across the state seem to be sending the message to Black North Carolina citizens, and other nonwhite North Carolina citizens, that they are less qualified to sit on these very serious cases.\"\n\nHenry White at his wedding in 1990.\n\nI n September , prosecutors with the North Carolina attorney general's office conceded that Batson claims from Henry White, a Black man serving a life sentence for shooting and killing a man during a robbery at a paint and body shop in Winston-Salem in 1996, should be reheard.\n\nLike Tucker, he was prosecuted by Spence, who sought the death penalty even though there were no eyewitnesses and no physical evidence tying White to the murder. White was sentenced to life without parole but still maintains that his cousin, who testified against him, is responsible for the murder .\n\nAccording to court documents, Spence struck two Black women during jury selection and admitted in court that race was a factor in his decision. \"Both Black females, both 27 years old,\" Spence told the court when his strikes were challenged by the defense. To overcome Batson, Spence recited a litany of seemingly race-neutral reasons for striking the two jurors, including the fact that one lived with her mother and that they both worked in health care. \"State thinks that people who want to save lives don't want to take lives,\" Spence added.\n\nThe trial judge overruled a challenge to the strikes from defense attorneys, and the jurors were dismissed. The next year, however, an appeals court found that race did play a predominant factor in the exclusion of the two Black jurors, the first and only time the court has done so. Still, it wasn't \"based solely on race,\" the court ruled, and the strikes - and the subsequent conviction - were found lawful. In the 35 years following Batson, this is the closest North Carolina's appeals courts have come to upholding a claim of race discrimination against a juror of color.\n\nBut in a brief filed in September , Stein, the attorney general, admitted that there was \"significant uncertainty\" surrounding whether the standard set forth in Batson was correctly met at trial and asked that his claims be remanded back to superior court. In late October, the Court of Appeals agreed to rehear White's claims.\n\nWhite said he's hopeful that the potential remand will lead to his release. \"I've been in here for 25 and half years for a murder I didn't commit,\" White said. \"And the person that committed the murder is still out there on the street - never did one day for it. I'm ready to come home. I've missed all my kids' young life and teenage life, and all of them are grown.\"\n\nHambourger, who represents both Tucker and White, said she's grateful for the state's response in White's case - she only wishes it would have taken the same step in Tucker's. \"They want to kill Mr. Tucker.\" Indeed, the last person to be executed in North Carolina - Samuel Flippen, who died by lethal injection in 2006 - was also prosecuted in Forsyth County. Flippen was sentenced to death for killing his 2-year-old stepdaughter; in June, attorneys for her biological father filed a motion in Forsyth Superior Court suggesting that she was killed by her mother.\n\nThe Wake County Justice Center is seen in downtown Raleigh, N.C., on Oct. 31, 2021.\n\nT o understand why North Carolina prosecutors have been so successful in their efforts to thwart Batson, Irving Joyner, a law professor at North Carolina Central University, suggests starting with judges, who he describes as \"the front line of the Batson challenge.\" Joyner, an attorney for the North Carolina State Conference of the NAACP, signed an amicus brief in support of Tucker's claim in July.\n\nJoyner said many judges are former prosecutors and place a lot of trust in them. \"If innately in your belief system is that whatever they [prosecutors] do is all right, then you're not going to find a Batson violation or a reason to question a prosecutor's explanation of why a person of color or gender has been removed from the jury,\" Joyner said. Some judges don't even believe in Batson, he added.\n\nThere are also judges who don't believe that racism exists in the criminal legal system. Judge Jefferson Griffin, elected to the North Carolina Court of Appeals in 2020, wrote in a September concurrence related to a traffic-stop case that \"the law is color blind and applies equally to every citizen in the United States of America,\" a rebuke to a post-George Floyd statement about racial bias from former North Carolina Supreme Court Chief Justice Cheri Beasley.\n\nJoyner also said it's also important to examine how prosecutors are trained, like in Top Gun II. \"Prosecutors of old are training prosecutors anew,\" Joyner said. \"That is the standard, and those old practices prevail irrespective of a change at the top or a change in the suggested methodology for dealing with jury selection.\"\n\nSpence, who, according to the Michigan State University study , struck 62 percent of Black jurors across four capital cases compared to just 20 percent of white jurors, led a Batson training at a capital litigation seminar in 2011 - nearly 15 years after admitting to striking jurors because they were Black. According to a study conducted by the Jury Sunshine Project of felony trials in North Carolina that same year, \"prosecutors in Forsyth County removed black jurors from the box three times more often than they removed white jurors.\"\n\nBrendon Woods, the chief public defender of Alameda County, California, recognizes the pattern and practice inherent in jury discrimination. The state has an appellate record on Batson on par with North Carolina. So in late August, Woods took to Twitter and laid out a plan for making juries more diverse, some of which has already been accomplished in California through state legislation, like the end of a ban on people convicted of felonies from serving on juries and paying low-income jurors more to serve. In October, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law legislation guaranteeing low-income jurors in San Francisco $100 a day for their service.\n\nAnother piece of key legislation, set to take effect for criminal trials in California in 2022, is A.B. 3070 , which Woods describes as \"a tremendous fix to Batson.\" Modeled after a similar rule enacted in Washington state in 2018, the law prohibits the peremptory strike of a juror just because they had a negative experience with law enforcement. Perhaps no state has gone as far as Arizona, whose Supreme Court eliminated peremptory strikes altogether in August.\n\n\"Batson allowed prosecutors to remove Black people for a thousand reasons except saying, 'I'm kicking you off because you're Black,'\" Woods said. \"What was most insidious about it is that you're removing Black people from being on a jury based on what I always call 'the Black experience' - removing Black people from juries because they don't trust police officers or because they had a bad interaction with a police officer or because they believe police engage in racial profiling.\"\n\nReflecting on his own experience as a Black man working in the criminal legal system, Woods added, \"Would I be able to sit as a juror independent of me being a lawyer, based on my experiences? Probably not. There isn't a prosecutor in the world that would keep me - just because I've had some negative experience with law enforcement. That's just being Black, right?\"\n\nDorian Hamilton poses for a portrait outside the Wake County Justice Center in downtown Raleigh, N.C., on Oct. 31. 2021.\n\nA s soon as Hamilton stepped outside that Wake County courtroom in 2017, Hambourger challenged Lively's strike under Batson.\n\nWhen Lively responded with his race-neutral reasons, he first pointed to Hamilton's negative experience with law enforcement and her acknowledgment that racial profiling exists. \"You know, we never got to a place where she could be challenged for cause, but I think that her concerns give us a real legitimate doubt that she would actually be able to return that sentence if she were called upon by the evidence,\" he said. Lively also cited Hamilton's views on the death penalty along with the concerns she had about other jurors' potential bias.\n\nJudge Paul Ridgway quickly denied the defense's Batson challenge, and Hamilton was dismissed. The whole process lasted 10 minutes.\n\nHamilton said she wanted to serve on the jury because she wanted to be part of the trial and believed that she would have been unbiased and honest in her service. To Hamilton, it didn't matter that Holden was Black, or that she thought racial profiling existed, or that she had nuanced views on the death penalty, or that a police officer had pulled a gun on her for no reason.\n\n\"Yeah, you have negative experiences,\" she said. \"But that's not going to cloud my judgement. I'm not going to just let him go free because we're both Black.\"\n\nAfter closing arguments, the jury took just over a day to find Holden guilty of first-degree murder and only a few hours to sentence him to life instead of death. Holden was prosecuted in Wake County - where DA Lorrin Freeman has sought the death penalty at trial more than prosecutors in any other North Carolina county and where her prosecutors continue to seek death despite juries repeatedly returning life without parole sentences . Damon Chetson, who is running against Freeman in the Democratic primary in 2022, has said he will not seek the death penalty if he's elected.\n\nIn December 2019, Holden appealed his conviction. Batson is at the heart of his appeal , citing the peremptory strikes of seven potential jurors who are female, Black, or both, like Hamilton. According to a 2021 affidavit prepared for another case Lively prosecuted this summer, he struck Black jurors in capital cases at 2.5 times the rate of non-Black jurors. The odds of that disparity occurring were 1 in 1000, signaling that race was likely the motivating factor for those strikes, the affidavit noted. Lively declined to comment, citing the pending litigation.\n\nIn December 2020, the North Carolina Court of Appeals remanded Holden's case back to Superior Court, where another Batson hearing will be held. He will likely return to the Court of Appeals and then the North Carolina Supreme Court, where he may make history - if Tucker, White, or someone else doesn't do it first. No hearing date has been set.\n\nHamilton was disappointed that the opportunity for her to serve on a jury was taken away. She also admits to feeling a little naive for thinking that the reason could have been for something other than her race. \"It was just the fact that it was who I was,\" she said, \"that made it so they didn't want me.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Nine Ways the U.S. Voting System Is Rigged But Not Against Donald Trump\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nVoting isn't rigged against Donald Trump - it's rigged in obvious and subtle ways against minorities and people without much money.\n\nDonald Trump is right - the U.S. voting system is totally rigged!\n\nIt's not rigged against him, though. It's rigged against people without much money, and people who are members of any number of minority groups.\n\nSome of the rigging is by design, and dates all the way back to the Founding Fathers. Some of it is simply a byproduct of an economic system where the top 0.1 percent have almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. Some falls somewhere in between.\n\nAdd it all up, and it constitutes a gigantic obstacle to regular people using their purported power to run our purported democracy.\n\nHere are some of the ways in which the voting system is rigged, few of which are ever discussed in American elections - which some might say constitutes its own kind of rigging.\n\nBetween one-quarter and one-third of American adults, up to 50 million people, are eligible to vote but aren't registered to vote.\n\nThat's ridiculous. Why do American adults have to take a special, extra step to govern themselves?\n\nMany other countries, including France, Italy, Chile, Israel, Sweden, Denmark and Finland, all register everyone to vote automatically. Not coincidentally, they have much higher voter turnout than we do.\n\nThe unregistered are younger, poorer and less white than registered voters. They're also more likely to support progressive political policies, such as a higher minimum wage and a financial transactions tax.\n\nThe good news is that five states - Oregon, California, West Virginia, Vermont and Connecticut - now have near-automatic voter registration , and many other states are considering it. Hillary Clinton has called for the federal government to push all states to make it happen.\n\nThe less money and power you have, the harder it is to take time off from work to vote.\n\nMany states now have early voting , but some do not. Even if you can vote early, the rules are different everywhere and often change. We should expand and standardize early voting but also, as Sen. Bernie Sanders has proposed , make election day a national holiday.\n\nA man checks in during early voting in Gaithersburg, Md.\n\nIn 2012, a slight majority of Americans voted for a Democrat for their congressional representative. Nevertheless, 54 percent of the elected representatives were Republicans.\n\nThis was thanks to both gerrymandering and the tendency of Democratic voters to live in dense cities. Currently Republican state legislatures use computer software to pack Democratic voters into as few districts as possible, creating the characteristically bizarre gerrymandered shape . But computers can also be used to create districts that look \"fair\" - i.e., compact and contiguous - and these would still put Democrats at a disadvantage because Democrats have by choice packed themselves into a few small places.\n\nThis is a problem that may not have an easy answer. Gerrymandering is to some degree in the eye of the beholder. Cities are probably going to remain highly Democratic. Some people believe it would be best to turn states into \"multimember districts,\" so that if the state sends seven representatives to the House, everyone in the state would get seven votes and would choose their top seven candidates.\n\n6.1 million Americans can't vote this year because they've been convicted of a felony. 2.2 million of them are African American; in Florida, Kentucky, Tennessee and Virginia more than 1 in 5 black adults can't vote.\n\nNo other country works like this. The solution here is simple: As in France, Germany, Israel, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Peru, Poland and Romania, everyone should be eligible to vote, including those convicted of felonies and even those currently in prison.\n\nPaul Weyrich, one of the founders of today's conservative movement, cheerfully explained in 1980 that \"I don't want everybody to vote. ... Our leverage in the elections quite candidly goes up as the voting populace goes down.\"\n\nRepublicans have taken this perspective to heart for decades, and are doing their best again in 2016 to reduce the number of people voting. Popular methods include purging voter rolls of eligible voters , reducing polling times and places , requiring photo ID to vote and voter intimidation .\n\nInstant runoff voting, which was recently used in the London mayoral election , lets third-party supporters vote for their first choice without fear they'll act as spoilers and help elect their least favorite candidate.\n\nHere's how it works: Voters rank as many candidates as they like in the order of their preference, from first to last. If a candidate gets a majority of first choice ballots, he or she wins. If not, the last place candidate is eliminated - and his or her votes are distributed to the candidates who were the second choice of the eliminated candidate's supporters. And so on. (If this sounds confusing, a Minnesota Public Radio video explains it in a clever way using post-its .)\n\nIn terms of this election, a Jill Stein voter who loathes Trump and lives in a swing state can't vote for Stein without helping Trump. With instant runoff voting, such a Stein supporter could rank Stein as his or her first choice, Clinton as his or her second, and Trump last or not at all.\n\nThere is a built-in bipartisan consensus against any such move, however, since it would weaken the two-party duopoly that runs U.S. politics.\n\nThe Senate hugely magnifies the power of small states. Deep red Wyoming, population 582,000, has two senators. So does deep blue California, with a population of 38.8 million, 66 times greater than Wyoming's.\n\nThat is so rigged!\n\nThe Senate's ability to slow or stop change is why it was created in the first place. As James Madison, the main author of the Constitution, put it in 1787: \"Our government ought to secure the permanent interests of the country against innovation\" and \"protect the minority of the opulent against the majority.\" The Senate, Madison said, should be the part of the government designed to do this.\n\nThe U.S. economy is like a car with two gas pedals and two brakes. Congress controls one of each, but the Federal Reserve controls the others.\n\nIts seven governors are appointed by presidents to 14-year terms. Even worse, the Federal Open Market Committee, which controls interest rates, is made up of the seven governors plus five members who are presidents of the regional Federal Reserve Banks. The regional presidents are chosen in a process that's largely controlled by banks .\n\nAs John Dewey, one of America's most important pro-democracy philosophers, wrote in 1931 , \"politics is the shadow cast on society by big business.\"\n\nThis could be seen most clearly in the 2008 Wall Street bailout. Not only did the biggest banks have the power to destroy the U.S. economy in a way no politicians ever could, they easily forced the entire political system to stop everything and give them what turned out to be trillions of dollars.\n\nOn a smaller scale, both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump hope to slash the tax rate on multinational corporations even though I'm guessing this is not one of your top priorities.

Photo: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA poll worker posts receipts from vote counting machines showing they have been properly prepared during early voting in Gaithersburg, Md.\n\nWhew, that's a long and depressing list. But don't give up: That list used to be much, much longer, yet regular people have been successfully fighting to shrink it for 240 years. There's no reason to believe we can't make it shorter still or eventually eliminate it altogether.\n\nSo go vote ! There's a reason this list exists, which is that democracy is powerful and dangerous and lots of people want to limit it. Don't let them.\n\nWAIT!
