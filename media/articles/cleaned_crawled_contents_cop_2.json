      "text": "'Despicable behavior': Cop who arrested NFL star outside stadium on game day placed on leave\n\nJust before the Miami Dolphins' home opener on Sunday afternoon, star wide receiver Tyreek Hill was arrested just outside of the stadium as fans watched. Now, the officer at the center of the fracas is on desk duty.\n\nNBC News reported Tuesday that Officer Danny Torres, who has been with the Miami-Dade Police Department for 27 years, was placed on administrative leave after the body camera footage of Hill's arrest went public. Hill was ordered to lay facedown on the ground at roughly 10:40 AM on Sunday morning just outside of Hard Rock Stadium after he was pulled over for alleged careless driving and failure to wear a seat belt.\n\nInitially, police declined to release the body camera video from the confrontation, attributing their decision to an ongoing internal investigation. But the footage was finally released Monday , and it shows Torres growing increasingly irritated with Hill after the 2023 NFL MVP candidate rolled up his window while Torres was speaking and urging the officer to hurry up so he could get to the locker room.\n\n\"Just give me my ticket bro so I can go,\" Hill is heard saying from the driver's seat of his 2018 McLaren. \"I'm finna be late to the game. Do what you gotta do.\"\n\n\"Keep it down. Hey! Keep your window down!\" Torres yelled at Hill after the Dolphins' star wideout rolled up his window. \"As a matter of fact, get out of the car. Get out of the car now! We're not playing this game.\"\n\nThe video then shows police yanking Hill's door open, hauling him out of the driver's seat, and forcing him to the ground. Hill complained about the rough treatment by officers, telling them he had been through knee surgery and wouldn't be able to play that afternoon due to how he was being handled in police custody (Hill suffered an ankle injury in the 2023 season that sidelined him for one game).\n\n\"What a coincidence. Did you just have surgery on your ears when we told you to put your window down?\" One officer said in response.\n\nFellow Miami Dolphins player Calais Campbell was driving by the scene at the time of Hill's arrest. When he got out of his car to approach his teammate, officers also placed him in handcuffs. A third Dolphins player who pulled over at the scene was not arrested, though officers at the scene requested his driver's license. The Dolphins issued a statement accusing the arresting officer of \" despicable behavior .\"\n\n\"I'm just being Black in America, bro,\" Hill is heard saying while handcuffed.\n\nDespite Hill's arrest and complaints about his treatment at the hands of officers, he nonetheless managed to score a touchdown in the Dolphins' win over the Jacksonville Jaguars. That touchdown was the longest of his NFL career , in which Hill sprinted 54 yards after catching a pass from quarterback Tua Tagovailoa. Fellow wide receiver Jaylen Waddle participated in Hill's touchdown celebration, in which he mimicked cuffing Hill's hands behind his back and \"detaining\" him in the end zone."

      "text": "Republicans would be screaming 'cop killer' every day if Obama did this\n\nFormer President Barack Obama during the inauguration of Donald Trump as the 47th president of the United States takes place inside the Capitol Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol building.\n\nIn your mind, turn the tables for a moment.\n\nIf Barack Obama had sent a murderous mob against the Capitol and they had beaten and pepper-sprayed Officer Brian Sicknick so badly he suffered two strokes and died the next day, how would Republicans refer to the so-called \"J6 rioters\"? Is there any doubt in your mind that they'd be calling them \"Cop killers\"? Every day, day after day, in every venue possible? And if Obama pardoned them, they'd be demanding impeachment right now?\n\nIf Bill Clinton had denied security to military or intelligence officers like Mark Milley or John Bolton who were under death threats from Iran, what would Republicans say? You know they'd be charging Clinton with attempted murder, saying he was no better than a mob boss who'd sanctioned a hit.\n\nIf Joe Biden had started shipping white supremacists convicted of criminal acts to Guantanamo, what would the GOP be claiming non-stop? We'd never hear the end about his sanctioning torture, murder, and how the entire offshore enterprise was unconstitutional and illegal. They'd call him Ayatollah Biden.\n\nAnd that's just scratching the tiniest surface of opportunities Democrats have blown in the past week to attack Trump and Republicans for very real violations of law, norms, and the Constitution.\n\nNext week the DNC will have a new chair, who will hopefully provide solid and aggressive leadership. Because the key to Democratic success over the next two (and four) years is pretty simple: Messaging.\n\nFirst, Democrats must frame the fight in simple, moral terms. From the Civil Rights era to the War in Vietnam, there was a time when my party knew how to do this; lately, it seems they've all fallen asleep (with a few rare exceptions).\n\nInstead of saying, \"We need to expand social safety net programs,\" they should say, as Lyndon Johnson often did, \"No child in America should go to bed hungry.\" Their next sentence should add, \"But childhood hunger is just fine with Republicans trying to protect tax cuts for their Mar-a-Lago billionaires.\"\n\nSecond, Democrats should stop playing defense and instead seize the populist high ground. FDR knew how to do this and delighted in it. In one speech, referring to the morbidly rich of his day, he said, \"They are unanimous in their hate for me-and I welcome their hatred.\"\n\nIn today's social media politics if you're not fighting as if it's war, you're losing. Instead of arguing for \"fair\" taxation, say, \"Trump wants to kill your healthcare and torch your kid's school to pay for his billionaire tax cuts!\"\n\nOr, as Reagan once asked a group of schoolchildren in a moment of accidental candor, \"Do you think the millionaire ought to pay more in taxes than the bus driver or less?\" The kids all shouted, \"More!\"\n\nKeep it simple.\n\nThird, ruthlessly define the Republican opposition and the morbidly rich broligarchs who own them. Lyndon Johnson famously labeled Barry Goldwater as a dangerous war-monger with his \"Daisy\" ad; it was simple, emotional, and effective.\n\nInstead of generalizations or abstractions, Democrats must characterize Republicans in stark, explicit terms. Instead of saying, \"Trump's policies are dangerous,\" they should claim, \"Trump is trying to be a dictator, and wants to destroy our democracy.\"\n\nDon't be afraid to use fear, particularly when it's justified. But always also include hope for a brighter future: Any marketing executive can tell you the best sales pitch involves both fear and hope. \"Trump is tearing down our government so he can give its pieces to his rich Mar-a-Lago crowd, but we're fighting to stop him so America can have a revival of the middle class.\"\n\nFourth, tell stories instead of facts. Ronald Reagan wanted to fund his tax cuts for billionaires by cutting welfare payments, so he invented a Black \"welfare queen\" to convince Americans fraud was rampant. Democrats have the advantage that they don't need to lie to tell stories that illustrate their arguments.\n\nInstead of saying, \"Healthcare should be a human right,\" tell a personal story: \"Sarah, a single mom in Ohio, works two jobs, but she can't afford her son's insulin. That's wrong.\"\n\nEvery woman victimized by Republican abortion laws should have her story spread far and wide, like GOP strategists did with Laken Riley, the woman killed by an undocumented criminal. Instead of noting that Harvard Medical School found that over 45,000 Americans die every year because insurance companies refuse to pay for procedures or treatments, pick two or three peoples' horror stories and make them as famous as Republicans did with Ashli Babbit, Daniel Penny, and Kyle Rittenhouse.\n\nHumans, after all, are story machines; it's how we transmit culture and the rules of society ( The little boy who cried \"wolf,\" The emperor's new clothes, The ant and the grasshopper, etc. ). Every bill, every campaign, every attack on Republicans should have a relatable human story attached to it.\n\nFifth, use repetition and slogans. Remember the old advertising bromide that people don't recognize a message until they've seen or heard it at least seven times.\n\nDonald Trump knows this one well; remember his \"Build the wall\" and \"Fake news\" slogans? He repeated them until every American who's even half-conscious was repeating them in their sleep. Same with \"Make America Great Again.\"\n\nDemocrats must develop catchy, oft-repeated slogans and market the hell out of them through repetition by every member of the Party at every opportunity: \"Democracy vs. Dictatorship,\" \"People over Profits,\" \"Freedom means healthcare, voting rights, and fair wages,\" \"MAGA is the new Klan.\"\n\nSixth, appeal to patriotism and invoke American history and values. Lincoln framed the Civil War as a battle for the survival of democracy itself. FDR invoked the age-old battle of struggling working people against the selfish, tyrannical rich. Lyndon Johnson, talking about the strategy rich white conservatives had used to keep poor white people on their side for a century, famously said :\n\nDemocrats must reclaim the language of patriotism. \"The real America is one where every vote counts, every worker gets a fair wage, and every kid has a future.\" \"MAGA racism and sexism should have no place in our country.\" \"Our founders fought and died for freedom, not for tax breaks for Trump's rich Mar-a- Lago friends.\"\n\nSeven, take a lesson from late-night television and weaponize humor: Use mockery against self-aggrandizing Republicans like Trump. On most issues, Republicans must lie to gain support (tax cuts trickle down, immigrants increase crime, Black voters cheat, etc.), so simply telling the truth with a cutting edge can be incredibly effective.\n\nBut don't forget ridicule: When Marco Rubio pointed out the size of Trump's tiny hands in 2016, he obsessed over it for more than a year. He hates having it pointed out to him that he's bald and the plugs across the front of his hairline didn't go right (as my wife, Louise, said to his face). Combover Don. The little-fingered dictator. Stormy's little mushroom.\n\nInstead of claiming, \"Trump is unfit for office,\" say, \"America deserves a president who can spell.\" Turn his absurdity into a joke.\n\nEight, inspire with a bold vision. Republicans have never been afraid to shoot for the moon, and there was a time when that was true of Democrats as well. Literally: in his inaugural address, President Kennedy set out the moon shot as a goal of his administration.\n\nBrand that vision with a slogan (see 5) like JFK did with his \"New Frontier\" and Obama did with his \"Yes, we can\" catchphrase. Simplify relentlessly. As Trump said when he spoke at Davos, \"Three days ago, I took the oath of office and we began the golden age of America.\"\n\nInstead of wonky crap like, \"We need a more progressive tax system,\" say, \"Imagine an America where no one struggles just to survive. That future is possible.\"\n\nThe bottom line is that Democrats and progressives win when they speak emotionally, define their enemies, tell human stories, and offer a vision worth fighting for. They lose when they sound like bureaucrats or assume that facts alone will persuade people.\n\nAs I lay out in my book on political messaging, Cracking the Code: How to Win Hearts, Change Minds, and Restore America's Original Vision , Republicans understand the power of messaging and there have been several times in our history when Democrats did, too.\n\nHopefully, with the reboot of the Party this weekend, they can re-learn those simple lessons and begin to kick some Republican ass.\n\nNOW READ: There will be a reckoning: Trump nightmare not all bad if it wakes America up"

      "text": "Cop who killed George Floyd 'stabbed by another inmate' in federal prison and 'seriously injured'\n\nDisgraced former Minneapolis, Minnesota police officer Derek Chauvin - who was convicted in 2021 for the murder of George Floyd - was just stabbed at a federal prison in Arizona.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, Chauvin was \"stabbed by another inmate and seriously injured\" in the attack around 12:30 PM local time, and taken to a local hospital for further treatment after prison staff performed \"life-saving measures.\" Chauvin is roughly a year into both a 21-year federal prison sentence for depriving Floyd of his constitutional rights, and a 22 year state-level sentence for second-degree murder.\n\nChauvin was sent to FCI Tucson in 2022 after serving time at a maximum security prison in Minnesota, where he was largely kept in solitary confinement for his own protection. The AP reports that FCI Tucson has been \"plagued by security lapses and staffing shortages,\" and that this is the second such incident in roughly a year.\n\nPOLL: Should Trump be allowed to hold office again?\n\nIn November 2022, an inmate pulled a gun and attempted to shoot a visitor, though the weapon misfired and no one was hurt. This is also the second attack on a high-profile federal prisoner in the last five months. At a separate federal prison in Florida, former sports doctor Larry Nassar, who is serving time in prison for serial sex offenses committed against gymnasts, was stabbed by an inmate in July. He survived the attack.\n\nOn May 25, 2020, Chauvin was recorded on video kneeling on the neck of Floyd for approximately eight minutes and 15 seconds, who was being detained for allegedly paying for a pack of cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 bill. Floyd was heard on the video screaming \"I can't breathe\" and crying for his mother in the moments before his murder. The video outraged protesters, who took to the streets both in the US and around the world in a summer-long wave of anti-police brutality protests, with \"I can't breathe\" as a rallying cry.\n\nAccording to a New York Times analysis of the events of that day, Chauvin \"did not remove his knee even after Mr. Floyd lost consciousness and for a full minute and 20 seconds after paramedics arrived at the scene.\" Chauvin and several other officers present during Floyd's murder were all fired the next day, and subsequently charged by Hennepin County prosecutors. Tou Thao, who was acting as a \"human traffic cone\" at the time of Floyd's murder, was sentenced to four years and nine months in state prison."

She specifically asked the 44 year-old retired law enforcement officer his thoughts on Trump pardoning Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes, who was serving an 18-year prison sentence for seditious conspiracy - the most serious charge handed down to any of the participants in the deadly riot.\n\nBefore letting Fanone speak, Brown played a clip of Rhodes speaking after he was released from federal custody. When Rhodes was asked during a press conference if he had any regrets, he quickly responded no, insisting that he and his fellow defendants \"did the right thing.\"\n\n\"We were there to protect Trump supporters from Antifa,\" Rhodes said, parroting the debunked conspiracy theory that the most violent offenders were leftists masquerading as Trump supporters. \"We were there to protect and secure two permitted events on Capitol grounds where members of Congress were going to speak. The guys that went inside, they're not committing any crimes. In fact, they helped people. They helped the police and help the people out.\"\n\n\"He says he has no regrets,\" Brown said after the clip aired. \"What do you say, Michael?\"\n\n\"Yeah. I mean, this is what I say to Stewart Rhodes. Go f- yourself. you're a liar,\" Fanone said as Brown nearly jumped out of her seat.\n\n\"We didn't obviously get to to beep that word out,\" Brown said nervously. \"But obviously, you, this is personal to you, Michael.

One instructor reportedly told session participants to \"be the calmest person in the room but have a plan to kill everyone.\" Another boasted that he was \"batting .500\" when shooting people in the line of duty, killing four people while shooting in eight in 13 recorded instances of excessive force. An Oklahoma sheriff leading one session said \"sometimes you have to shoot folks\" when talking about police officers having an affinity for firearms.\n\nStreet Cop founder Dennis Benigno initially sued to stop Walsh's office from investigating his firm, but lost in court. He told the New Jersey Monitor that he planned to \"impose stricter standards on colloquial and jocular language occasionally used by some instructors\" in future training sessions, and that some of the comments Walsh's office highlighted in his report were \"an attempt at humor.\"\n\n\"[T]here is not one single instance in the OSC Report where we have advocated any practice that is inconsistent with quality policing,\" Benigno said. \"Isolated excerpts taken out of context from a week-long training are not reflections of the overall quality of the education that Street Cop provides.\"\n\nWalsh said during a press conference that Street Cop is just one of several firms he wants to investigate, saying \"systemic risks seem to extend far beyond Street Cop, and Street Cop and this particular training provides an example of what can go wrong, and went very wrong there.\"\n\nThe full report is here .\n\nA new document released this week reveals first-hand accounts of a Portland police officer's racist remarks that led to his firing. But despite the disturbing comments documented in the newly revealed letter, he will still be getting a $100,000 settlement payout.\n\nThis article was produced in partnership with the South Bend Tribune , a member of ProPublica s Local Reporting Network . It was co-published with the New York Times.\n\nPolice outside of Charleston, South Carolina, don't believe that high school students should read about police brutality. So even though two books on the subject were assigned on a summer reading list for a high school freshman class, local police made sure to express their objections . The Hate U Give is a book about a teenage girl dealing with the shooting of her unarmed best friend at the hands of police. All American Boys chronicles the experience of a teenage boy who is wrongly accused of stealing and then is beaten by a police officer. Both are award-winning books that made it on to the New York Times bestseller list. Neither book is required-they are two on a list of eight and students are only asked to choose one to read.\n\nEphraim Casado was pulled over for littering in 2017. His lawyer says Miami-Dade authorities committed assault after Casado exited his vehicle with hands raised.\n\nPresident Donald Trump endorsed the demands of Chicago police officers in their conflict with the city's mayor in a tweet Friday night, saying they have \"have every right to legally protest\" - a sentiment seeming to conflict with his push to punish black athletes in the NFL who protest silently during the national anthem.\n\nA Louisiana woman was arrested on homicide charges after an off-duty police officer crashed into the car she was riding in and killed her baby daughter.\n\nWhat the public gets wrong.\n\nBaltimore City Police officers of the Gun Trace Task Force (GTTF) Evodio Hendrix, Maurice Ward , Daniel Hersl, Marcus Taylor , Wayne Jenkins, Thomas Allers, Jemell Rayam and Momodu Gondo are guilty of a plethora of crimes falling under their racketeering convictions, ranging from robbery and selling drugs to fraud. All eight men are currently awaiting sentencing.\n\nAs I've been following this case, listening to opinions and collecting information­, one common narrative I've heard is this: \"Those cops only targeted criminals. They had to use special tactics to keep up with the everyday evolving world of crime, and everyday citizens weren't affected by their actions.\" This claim is problematic for a number of reasons. Let's use the case of April Sims as an example.\n\nSims, a successful hair stylist in Baltimore, was targeted by the GTTF back in 2016. Her flashy car caught the attention of Jenkins, and he started watching her apartment, excitedly reporting suspicious activity to Gondo, according to the Baltimore Sun . Jenkins then crafted a plan to raid her home in search of cash and other goods. He told Gondo that only they and Hersl would be involved in this mission. He thought there would be $40,000 to $50,000 inside that the three could split. Hersl responded, \"I can use the money, I'm in the process of buying a house.\"\n\nThe officers were caught on tape entering her complex. They were denied access by security until Hersl came in with a piece of paper and some police gear. The trio found no cash; however, they did retrieve 390 grams of heroin, gel caps, a digital scale and a Chanel bag worth $5,000. They turned in the drugs, along with the rest of the paraphernalia, and Gondo gave the purse to a woman he was dating. Reporting the drugs wasn't an example of good police work - it was a petty attempt to make Sims pay for not having cash in the house for the police officers to steal.\n\nThe counterargument I'm hearing revolves around the 390 grams of heroin that came off of the street as a result of the officers' break-in; however, that neglects the fact that the officers were not looking for drugs. Finding heroin was not a part of their agenda. They were looking for cash and stumbled across the heroin by mistake during a botched robbery, while using their badges as a shield. There's also the question of where the drugs actually came from - they could have been planted in Sims' home, as the racketeering investigation proved the members of the task force had done so to frame others.\n\nRemember, finding drugs was never a part of their mission. That means that they were the bad guys, too. Actually, the GTTF are worse than the bad guys, because they stole after pledging to protect and serve the people of Baltimore. Meanwhile, our taxes paid their ridiculously high salaries and their fraudulent overtime .\n\nTrue police reform will never happen as long as we continue to make excuses for police officers when they break laws while celebrating every time they accomplish something they get paid to do. Our low standards are evident when we applaud cops reporting a drug bust, even after we find out their only true intention was to steal.\n\nOn Thursday, Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee, with the support of four Democrats, recommended a Senate vote for Kurt Engelhardt, a district court judge in Louisiana who has been nominated by Donald Trump to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. That means Engelhardt will likely be up for confirmation very soon, despite his history of disturbing rulings on cases involving racial violence and injustice, as well as cases involving sexual harassment and workplace discrimination against women.\n\nThe linguistic gymnastics needed to report on police violence without calling up images of police violence is a thing of semantic wonder. Officers don't shoot, they are merely \"involved\" in shootings; victims are not victims, but \"suspects\" \"fleeing\"; human beings become premortem cadavers as bullets \"enter the torso\" rather than the chest of a person; guns and bullets act on their own as they \"discharge\" or \"enter the right femur,\" rather than being fired by autonomous individuals with agency and purpose. Headlines become 14-word, jargon-heavy tangles where a simple five-word description would suffice.\n\nIn September, Chicago Police Officer John Catanzara made headlines after posting on Facebook a picture of himself, in uniform, holding an American flag and a homemade sign that read, \"I stand for the anthem. I love the American flag. I support my president and the 2nd Amendment.\"\n\nProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom.

      "text": "Punishing a cowardly cop could create a perverse precedent in Florida\n\nScot Peterson is the first cop to be prosecuted for failing to act during a school shooting. The former school resource officer of Marjorie Stoneman Douglas high school faces a criminal charge for every child and adult who was shot after he arrived outside the building where Nicholas Cruz rampaged. If convicted of all charges, Peterson faces nearly a century in prison - the same as the gunman.\n\nThat's monstrous.\n\nPeterson is a coward, a f*ckup, a liar.\n\nBut he's not on par with a mass murderer.\n\nPeterson had a handgun on that horrible Valentine's Day in 2018, but no body armor and no rifle. The gunman was armed with an AR15 and thousands of rounds. If the 56-year-old glorified mall cop had rushed in alone, he probably would have added his name to the body count.\n\nPeterson is not a sympathetic figure. His nickname was \"Rod,\" short for \"Retired on Duty,\" a moniker he earned from his lackadaisical approach to his job. His claim that he hid because he thought that he saw a sniper inside shooting out is preposterous.\n\nThat said, Peterson is poised to become a scapegoat - a hapless creature banished to absolve the sins of others, namely the lawmakers who refuse to enact commonsense gun laws, and the judges and justices who refuse to uphold gun laws based on a historically bankrupt reading of the Second Amendment.\n\nSince the Columbine rampage of the late 1990s, police doctrine has stressed the importance of engaging the shooter immediately. But in the heat of the moment, doctrine amounts to a suggestion. Time and time again, officers fail to engage school shooters. Several other officers from the Parkland area responded to the scene but failed to enter the building. In Uvalde, Texas, an astonishing 376 officers failed to confront the shooter. A report later concluded that the officers put their personal safety above the wellbeing of the victims. The officers knew the shooter had an automatic weapon and they were scared.\n\n\"Protect and Serve\" is a popular police motto, but it's purely aspirational. The Supreme Court has ruled repeatedly that police officers typically have no duty to protect citizens. In light of these rulings, the 11th Circuit affirmed a lower court's decision to dismiss a lawsuit alleging that the police violated Parkland students' right to due process by standing by.\n\nFlorida prosecutors are trying to sidestep this body of law by prosecuting Peterson under a novel and extremely tenuous legal theory of child neglect. They contend that Deputy Peterson was a caregiver. His failure to intervene was a crime.\n\nIn their rush to nail a cowardly school resource officer, prosecutors could end up creating a perverse precedent. In 2019, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis threw open the doors to armed teachers in the classroom. Teachers are definitely caregivers. Would that mean that every pistol-packing teacher is criminally liable if they fail to draw on a school shooter with an AR?\n\nEven if the Florida courts manage to cobble together some novel legal duty to intervene in school shootings, it's not realistic to expect cops or anyone else to consistently live up to it. Soldiers train intensively and regularly to be able to run toward gunfire. Peterson had completed a few workshops on school shooters, which is laughably feeble preparation to override the instinct for self-preservation. Running toward gunfire to defend the innocent is heroic. But heroism is, by definition, above and beyond what's required. Making criminals out of ordinary people in impossible situations is grotesque.\n\nThe real problem is that most police officers are scared to face down shooters armed with weapons of war. The only solution is gun control.\n\nEverything else is a distraction."

      "text": "Cop who fought Jan. 6 rioters: 'We are one election away from the extinction of democracy'\n\nOn the eve of the third anniversary of the deadly January 6 insurrection, one of the former US Capitol Police Department officers who faced off with rioters is announcing his campaign for a Maryland congressional seat.\n\nHarry Dunn, who has been outspoken about the events of January 6, 2021, recently told NBC News that he was throwing his hat in the ring for an open US House of Representatives seat in Maryland's 3rd Congressional District, which became vacant with the retirement of Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Maryland). In a Friday morning interview on MSNBC, Dunn told host Mika Brzezinksi that he felt called to run as a means of protecting democracy.\n\n\"I don't think it's an exaggeration to say - it may sound scary, but we are one election away from the extinction of democracy as we know it,\" Dunn said. \"Donald Trump said it himself that he is ready to be a dictator. And a lot of his supporters will sit there and say, you know, 'he's just joking,' but how many times has he said the things that we thought were jokes that he actually did and took him seriously?\"\n\nPOLL: Should Trump be allowed to hold office again?\n\nIn an apparent shot across the bow at the House Republican majority, Dunn added that he wanted to \"fight back and be able to push back against the people in Congress right now\" who are threatening democracy, which Dunn said he \"spent the last 15 years of [his] life protecting.\"\n\nDunn has become a fixture in various court proceedings involving January 6 defendants, frequently testifying on the witness stand about being physically attacked by supporters of former President Donald Trump. During one case involving a member of the far-right militia Oath Keepers, Dunn was heard saying during the attack that \"we have dozens of officers down. They're taking them out on stretchers. Y'all are f---ing us up.\"\n\nAfter announcing his candidacy, Dunn will join a very crowded Democratic primary for Maryland's 3rd district, which, according to Ballotpedia, already has seven candidates vying for the party's nomination. While there are also two Republicans running for the seat, the district is not rated as competitive by Cook Political Report. An analysis by liberal website Daily Kos found that MD-3 went for Biden over Trump by a 25-point margin .\n\nWatch Dunn's interview below or by clicking this link ."

      "text": "Mississippi cop fired for allegedly stealing $32K from a dying woman\n\nThe Pearl Police Department fired patrol officer Taylor Loftin for reportedly stealing $32,000 from a dying woman's house. It's the second officer dismissed for alleged criminal conduct in less than a year.\n\nOn the morning of Nov. 18, Jason Kelly's mother, Jackie, collapsed unexpectedly, and his father called 911.\n\nAmbulance workers arrived. So did four or five Pearl police officers, including Loftin, Kelly said.\n\nHis 80-year-old mother never recovered and may have died of a blood clot, he said. \"It was unexpected.\"\n\nShe had just inherited $32,000 and received the money in cash, which she put in an envelope in her drawer in the bedroom, he said.\n\nAfter ambulance workers and police left, Kelly said his father determined the cash had been stolen and called Pearl police, who returned to the home.\n\nAfter arriving, Loftin admitted that he had opened the drawer and seen the money, but he insisted he closed it right back, Kelly said. \"He turned off his camera and stole $32,000.\"\n\nKelly praised Pearl police's swift response and said, \"I hope they press charges.\"\n\nHe said he doesn't know if the city is going to pay the family back.\n\nThe Mississippi Bureau of Investigation is investigating, but spokesperson Bailey Martin said the agency could not comment further. Loftin could not be reached for comment.\n\nKelly believes there must have been thefts on previous occasions as well. \"This ain't his first time doing this,\" he said.\n\nPearl Police Chief Nick McLendon said he's not aware of any previous incidents.\n\nAsked about possible criminal prosecution, he said he could not comment further because the case is under investigation.\n\nHe said in a statement made public that the officer hasn't been charged with any crime and should be presumed innocent. But the department, he said, \"must be concerned with even the slightest appearance of impropriety - and especially in the area of law enforcement.\"\n\nTwo days before Christmas 2023, Pearl police officer Michael Christian Green forced a man he arrested to lick urine from a holding cell floor.\n\nThe 26-year-old officer took the man into custody after a family disturbance call to Sam's Club in Pearl. After he booked the man into a holding cell, footage showed the man telling Green he needed to urinate, but when Green failed to respond, the man urinated in a corner, according to the federal bill of information.\n\nWhen Green found out what the man had done, Green berated him, \"Let me tell you something. You see this phone? I will beat your f-ing ass with it. You're fixin' to go in there, and you're gonna lick that p- up. Do you understand me? ... Go suck it up right now.\"\n\nGreen filmed the man as he licked the urine from the floor, and when the man gagged, Green said, \"Don't spit it out.\" When the man gagged, Green responded, \"Lick that s- up. Drink your f-in' p-.\"\n\nWhen the man was allowed to leave the booking area, he vomited in a garbage can.\n\nOn June 13, Green was sentenced to a year in federal prison and a $1,500 fine. He told the judge he regrets what he did.\n\nAt a press conference after Green's guilty plea, Pearl Mayor Jake Windham told reporters, \"God created us in his image. Treating someone like this is despicable.\"\n\n\"If you're going to operate as a police officer,\" said Windham, who served in law enforcement for 16 years, \"you've got to do things right.\"\n\nHe apologized to the man and his family for \"the horrible treatment by an officer of the law.\"\n\nAt the time, Windham declared, \"We hold our officers to a higher standard.\"\n\nFour days after the incident, Windham confronted Green and told him to resign, which he did.\n\nThe city handles matters swiftly, Windham said. \"I think there's a stark contrast between the Pearl Police Department and this incident [and the handling of] the 'Goon Squad.'\"\n\nSix Rankin County officers were involved in the January 2023 torture of two Black men and the shooting of one of them, but it wasn't until six months later that those involved were fired. The six officers pleaded guilty and are now serving between 10 and 40 years in federal prison.\n\nGreen had been on the force six months when this incident occurred. \"His certificate was clean when he came to the Pearl Police Department,\" Windham said. \"We strive to do an extensive background check on people.\"\n\nHe said he hopes law enforcement agencies would report any problems with officers to the Mississippi Board on Law Enforcement Officer Standards and Training.\n\nA new law, passed in the wake of the Goon Squad's acts, beefs up the board's ability to investigate allegations against officers.\n\nAs for Loftin, McLendon put the officer on administrative leave after investigating the matter. On Thursday, the Pearl Board of Aldermen fired the officer on McLendon's recommendation.\n\n\"We acted on it immediately,\" Windham said. \"We don't put up with it.\"\n\nIt's a bad situation when \"you have to terminate officers,\" he said, \"but we're going to make sure that if they screw up, we're going to send them down the road.\"\n\nAsked about getting the $32,000 back to the family, the mayor replied, \"Our goal is to make the family whole as soon as possible.\"\n\nLoftin was hired by Dean Scott, who resigned as Pearl police chief in January after an investigation into possible misuse of tax dollars. A WLBT investigation revealed that Scott claimed to work for Rankin County as a homestead fraud investigator while on city business at law enforcement conferences on the Coast. He now works as a lieutenant for Capitol Police.\n\nLoftin worked at a series of jobs in law enforcement. He worked at Flowood Police Department and Brandon Police Department before starting at Pearl Police Department, where he had worked a few years.\n\nLoftin graduated from Baylor University, is married and has a newborn son, according to his Facebook page.\n\n\"He threw his whole life away,\" Kelly said. \"You risk your whole family for $32,000?\"\n\nThis article first appeared on Mississippi Today and is republished here under a Creative Commons license."

All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nUnited Nations climate talks adopted a deal to inject at least $300 billion annually in humanity's fight against climate change, aimed at helping developing nations cope with the ravages of global warming in tense negotiations.\n\nActivists participate in a demonstration for climate finance at the COP29 U.N.

Climate Summit, Sunday, Nov. 24, 2024, in Baku, Azerbaijan. (AP Photo/Rafiq Maqbool)\n\nBAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) - In the wee hours Sunday at the United Nations climate talks, countries from around the world reached an agreement on how rich countries can cough up the funds to support poor countries in the face of climate change.\n\nIt's a far-from-perfect arrangement, with many parties still deeply unsatisfied but some hopeful that the deal will be a step in the right direction.\n\nWorld Resources Institute president and CEO Ani Dasgupta called it \"an important down payment toward a safer, more equitable future,\" but added that the poorest and most vulnerable nations are \"rightfully disappointed that wealthier countries didn't put more money on the table when billions of people's lives are at stake.\"\n\nThe summit was supposed to end on Friday evening but negotiations spiraled on through early Sunday. With countries on opposite ends of a massive chasm, tensions ran high as delegations tried to close the gap in expectations.\n\nHere's how they got there:\n\nRich countries have agreed to pool together at least $300 billion a year by 2035. It's not near the full amount of $1.3 trillion that developing countries were asking for, and that experts said was needed. But delegations more optimistic about the agreement said this deal is headed in the right direction, with hopes that more money flows in the future.\n\nThe text included a call for all parties to work together using \"all public and private sources\" to get closer to the $1.3 trillion per year goal by 2035. That means also pushing for international mega-banks, funded by taxpayer dollars, to help foot the bill. And it means, hopefully, that companies and private investors will follow suit on channeling cash toward climate action.\n\nThe agreement is also a critical step toward helping countries on the receiving end create more ambitious targets to limit or cut emissions of heat-trapping gases that are due early next year. It's part of the plan to keep cutting pollution with new targets every five years, which the world agreed to at the U.N. talks in Paris in 2015.\n\nThe Paris agreement set the system of regular ratcheting up climate fighting ambition as away to keep warming under 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. The world is already at 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) and carbon emissions keep rising.\n\nActivists participate in a demonstration for climate finance at the COP29 U.N. Climate Summit, Friday, Nov. 22, 2024, in Baku, Azerbaijan. (AP Photo/Sergei Grits)\n\nThe deal decided in Baku replaces a previous agreement from 15 years ago that charged rich nations $100 billion a year to help the developing world with climate finance.\n\nThe new number has similar aims: it will go toward the developing world's long laundry list of to-dos to prepare for a warming world and keep it from getting hotter. That includes paying for the transition to clean energy and away from fossil fuels. Countries need funds to build up the infrastructure needed to deploy technologies like wind and solar power on a large scale.\n\nCommunities hard-hit by extreme weather also want money to adapt and prepare for events like floods, typhoons and fires. Funds could go toward improving farming practices to make them more resilient to weather extremes, to building houses differently with storms in mind, to helping people move from the hardest-hit areas and to help leaders improve emergency plans and aid in the wake of disasters.\n\nThe Philippines, for example, has been hammered by six major storms in less than a month , bringing to millions of people howling wind, massive storm surges and catastrophic damage to residences, infrastructure and farmland.\n\n\"Family farmers need to be financed,\" said Esther Penunia of the Asian Farmers Association. She described how many have already had to deal with millions of dollars of storm damage, some of which includes trees that won't again bear fruit for months or years, or animals that die, wiping out a main source of income.\n\n\"If you think of a rice farmer who depends on his or her one hectare farm, rice land, ducks, chickens, vegetables, and it was inundated, there was nothing to harvest,\" she said.\n\nMukhtar Babayev, COP29 President, applauds as he attends a closing plenary at the COP29 U.N. Climate Summit, Sunday, Nov. 24, 2024, in Baku, Azerbaijan. (AP Photo/Rafiq Maqbool)\n\nElection results around the world that herald a change in climate leadership, a few key players with motive to stall the talks and a disorganized host country all led to a final crunch that left few happy with a flawed compromise.\n\nThe ending of COP29 is \"reflective of the harder geopolitical terrain the world finds itself in,\" said Li Shuo of the Asia Society. He cited Trump's recent victory in the US - with his promises to pull the country out of the Paris Agreement - as one reason why the relationship between China and the EU will be more consequential for global climate politics moving forward.\n\nDeveloping nations also faced some difficulties agreeing in the final hours, with one Latin American delegation member saying that their group didn't feel properly consulted when small island states had last-minute meetings to try to break through to a deal. Negotiators from across the developing world took different tacks on the deal until they finally agreed to compromise.\n\nMeanwhile, activists ramped up the pressure: many urged negotiators to stay strong and asserted that no deal would be better than a bad deal. But ultimately the desire for a deal won out.\n\nSome also pointed to the host country as a reason for the struggle. Mohamed Adow, director of climate and energy think tank Power Shift Africa, said Friday that \"this COP presidency is one of the worst in recent memory,\" calling it \"one of the most poorly led and chaotic COP meetings ever.\"\n\nThe presidency said in a statement, \"Every hour of the day, we have pulled people together. Every inch of the way, we have pushed for the highest common denominator. We have faced geopolitical headwinds and made every effort to be an honest broker for all sides.\"\n\nShuo retains hope that the opportunities offered by a green economy \"make inaction self-defeating\" for countries around the world, regardless of their stance on the decision. But it remains to be seen whether the UN talks can deliver more ambition next year.\n\nIn the meantime, \"this COP process needs to recover from Baku,\" Shuo said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporters Seth Borenstein and Sibi Arasu contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

(AP Photo/Sergei Grits)\n\nBAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) - United Nations climate talks adopted a deal to inject at least $300 billion annually in humanity's fight against climate change, aimed at helping developing nations cope with the ravages of global warming in tense negotiations.\n\nThe $300 billion will go to developing countries who need the cash to wean themselves off the coal, oil and gas that causes the globe to overheat, adapt to future warming and pay for the damage caused by climate change's extreme weather. It's not near the full amount of $1.3 trillion that developing countries were asking for, but it's three times a deal of $100 billion a year from 2009 that is expiring. Some delegations said this deal is headed in the right direction, with hopes that more money flows in the future.\n\nBut it was not quite the agreement by consensus that these meetings usually operate with and some developing nations were livid about being ignored.\n\nCOP29 President Mukhtar Babayev gaveled the deal into acceptance before any nation had a chance to speak. When they did they blasted him for being unfair to them, the deal for not being enough and the world's rich nations for being too stingy.\n\n\"It's a paltry sum,\" India negotiator Chandni Raina said, repeatedly saying how India objected to rousing cheers. \"I'm sorry to say we cannot accept it.\"\n\nShe told The Associated Press that she has lost faith in the United Nations system.\n\nA long line of nations agreed with India and piled on, with Nigeria's Nkiruka Maduekwe, CEO of the National Council on Climate Change, calling the deal an insult and a joke.\n\n\"I'm disappointed. It's definitely below the benchmark that we have been fighting for for so long,\" said Juan Carlos Monterrey, of the Panama delegation. He noted that a few changes, including the inclusion of the words \"at least\" before the number $300 billion and an opportunity for revision by 2030, helped push them to the finish line.\n\n\"Our heart goes out to all those nations that feel like they were walked over,\" he said.\n\nThe final package pushed through \"does not speak or reflect or inspire confidence,\" India's Raina said.\n\n\"We absolutely object to the unfair means followed for adoption,\" Raina said. \"We are extremely hurt by this action by the president and the secretariat.\"\n\nToeolesulusulu Cedric Schuster, Samoa environment minister, right, embraces an attendee during a closing plenary session at the COP29 U.N. Climate Summit, Sunday, Nov. 24, 2024, in Baku, Azerbaijan. (AP Photo/Rafiq Maqbool)\n\nSpeaking for nearly 50 of the poorest nations of the world, Evans Davie Njewa of Malawi was more mild, expressing what he called reservations with the deal. And the Alliance of Small Island States' Cedric Schuster said he had more hope \"that the process would protect the interests of the most vulnerable\" but nevertheless expressed tempered support for the deal.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a post on X that he hoped for a \"more ambitious outcome.\" But he said the agreement \"provides a base on which to build.\"\n\nThere were somewhat satisfied parties, with European Union's Wopke Hoekstra calling it a new era of climate funding, working hard to help the most vulnerable. But activists in the plenary hall could be heard coughing over Hoekstra's speech in an attempt to disrupt it.\n\nWopke Hoekstra, EU climate commissioner, speaks to members of the media at the COP29 U.N. Climate Summit, Sunday, Nov. 24, 2024, in Baku, Azerbaijan. (AP Photo/Joshua A. Bickel)\n\nEamon Ryan, Ireland's environment minister, called the agreement \"a huge relief.\"\n\n\"It was not certain. This was tough,\" he said. \"Because it's a time of division, of war, of (a) multilateral system having real difficulties, the fact that we could get it through in these difficult circumstances is really important.\"\n\nU.N. Climate Change's Executive Secretary Simon Stiell called the deal an \"insurance policy for humanity,\" adding that like insurance, \"it only works if the premiums are paid in full, and on time.\"\n\nThe deal is seen as a step toward helping countries on the receiving end create more ambitious targets to limit or cut emissions of heat-trapping gases that are due early next year. It's part of the plan to keep cutting pollution with new targets every five years, which the world agreed to at the U.N. talks in Paris in 2015.\n\nThe Paris agreement set the system of regular ratcheting up climate fighting ambition as away to keep warming under 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. The world is already at 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) and carbon emissions keep rising.\n\nActivists participate in a demonstration for climate finance at the COP29 U.N. Climate Summit, Saturday, Nov. 23, 2024, in Baku, Azerbaijan. (AP Photo/Sergei Grits)\n\nCountries also anticipate that this deal will send signals that help drive funding from other sources, like multilateral development banks and private sources. That was always part of the discussion at these talks - rich countries didn't think it was realistic to only rely on public funding sources - but poor countries worried that if the money came in loans instead of grants, it would send them sliding further backward into debt that they already struggle with.\n\n\"The $300 billion goal is not enough, but is an important down payment toward a safer, more equitable future,\" said World Resources Institute President Ani Dasgupta. \"This deal gets us off the starting block. Now the race is on to raise much more climate finance from a range of public and private sources, putting the whole financial system to work behind developing countries' transitions.\"\n\nAnd even though it's far from the needed $1.3 trillion, it's more than the $250 billion that was on the table in an earlier draft of the text, which outraged many countries and led to a period of frustration and stalling over the final hours of the summit.\n\nSimon Stiell, United Nations climate chief, speaks during a closing plenary session at the COP29 U.N. Climate Summit, Sunday, Nov. 24, 2024, in Baku, Azerbaijan. (AP Photo/Rafiq Maqbool)\n\nThe several different texts adopted early Sunday morning included a vague but not specific reference to last year's Global Stocktake approved in Dubai. Last year there was a battle about first-of-its-kind language on getting rid of the oil, coal and natural gas, but instead it called for a transition away from fossil fuels . The latest talks only referred to the Dubai deal, but did not explicitly repeat the call for a transition away from fossil fuels.\n\nCountries also agreed on the adoption of Article 6, creating markets to trade carbon pollution rights, an idea that was set up as part of the Paris Agreement to help nations work together to reduce climate-causing pollution. Part of that was a system of carbon credits, allowing nations to put planet-warming gasses in the air if they offset emissions elsewhere. Backers said a U.N.-backed market could generate up to an additional $250 billion a year in climate financial aid.\n\nDespite its approval, carbon markets remain a contentious plan because many experts say the new rules adopted don't prevent misuse, don't work and give big polluters an excuse to continue spewing emissions.\n\n\"What they've done essentially is undermine the mandate to try to reach 1.5,\" said Tamara Gilbertson, climate justice program coordinator with the Indigenous Environmental Network. Greenpeace's An Lambrechts, called it a \"climate scam\" with many loopholes.\n\nWith this deal wrapped up as crews dismantle the temporary venue, many have eyes on next year's climate talks in Belem, Brazil .\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalists Ahmed Hatem, Olivia Zhang, Aleksandar Furtula and Joshua A.

Chuck Grassley, who is looking into the matter.\n\nGrassley, R-Iowa, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, sent a letter this week to the center's CEO, Ju'Riese Colon, asking more questions about why the organization hired Jason Krasley as an investigator even though it had knowledge of his potential legal trouble.\n\n\"You conceded that this was 'concerning information' but hired him nonetheless after being unable to ascertain additional information,\" Grassley wrote to Colon, who had revealed that information to the senator in response to his original request in February, which stemmed from reporting by The Associated Press about Krasley's arrests.\n\n\"I find this deeply troubling,\" Grassley wrote.\n\nKrasley has been charged with multiple sex crimes, including rape, sex trafficking and soliciting prostitution, from episodes that occurred during his time at the Allentown, Pennsylvania, police department, and before he was hired by the center in 2021.\n\nThe center, which investigates sex-abuse cases in Olympic sports, fired Krasley in November, two months after learning of allegations that he stole money the Allentown police vice team had seized in a drug bust. Later came Krasley's arrest for alleged sex crimes and, in June 2024, an arrest for harassment that was resolved in December.\n\nGrassley's letter recounts what Colon wrote to him: that one of Krasley's references during the hiring process \"shared with you that he was the subject of an internal investigation by the Allentown police department.\" The case, the letter said, was based on statements from an alleged victim that the person later recanted.\n\nThe center provided the AP with its response to Grassley, dated March 14, in which Colon writes that the case has triggered several changes in the center's vetting process. Under the new rules, she wrote, \"this disclosure would have raised a red flag and prompted additional scrutiny into the alleged conduct that led to the internal investigation.\"\n\nColon outlined enhancements of the center's code of ethics and the addition of an ethics clause that employees must adhere to. She said she is now personally interviewing all final candidates for jobs and that the center plans to contract with an outside consultant to review its recruiting and hiring process.\n\nShe also said the center now checks the National Decertification Index (NDI) , which keeps track of discipline related to officer misconduct.\n\nThe center's letter said Krasley handled 124 cases, 15 of which were open when he was terminated.\n\nThe center said there were no complaints of sexual misconduct while Krasley worked there.\n\nThe former police officer is free on bail awaiting trial. His attorney has asserted his client's innocence in the sex-crime cases, which date to 2015, most recently calling them \"meritless and uncorroborated allegations from drug-addled and impaired prostitutes.\"\n\nThe center has also hired a third-party firm to reach out to people whose cases were handled by Krasley.\n\nThat carried potential to retraumatize victims, one of whom, Jacqui Stevenson, told the AP the center's outreach about a case that had long been resolved triggered \"a total panic attack.\"\n\nIn her letter, Colon explained that the two-month delay in firing Krasley was because of a concerted effort not to take steps that would compromise the criminal investigation - reasoning that did not sway Grassley.\n\n\"I imagine you appreciate that impressions regarding SafeSport's judgment in hiring and firing decisions impact impressions of SafeSport's ability to properly investigate and resolve allegations of misconduct in the sports community,\" Grassley wrote.\n\nGrassley sent a separate letter to the center's chair, April Holmes, saying there \"appears to be a lack of oversight by the Board to adequately supervise the CEO ... and other officers and directors in their duties to the organization.\"\n\nThe senator questioned whether an increase in funding - something Colon has asked for - from its current budget of around $21 million a year would solve its problems, some of which he suggested are rooted in the complex nature of resolving sex-abuse allegations.\n\nHe said \"there is concern that SafeSport is not prioritizing serious sexual and child abuse cases over other cases, which is causing more serious cases to languish without proper investigation.\"\n\nThere was criticism of the center's spending, including its $2.4 million in billing for legal services in 2023.\n\nAlso, Grassley pointed out $50,000 on dues and subscriptions, $36,000 on bank fees and credit cards and more than $390,000 on travel, all \"expenses that seem excessive for a non-profit organization and financial decisions that seem counter-productive to the organization.\"\n\nGrassley asked Holmes to answer a series of questions, including how the board determined salaries for executives, including Colon, who made more than $400,000 in 2023, which included a $58,000 bonus.\n\nHolmes said the board received the letter and would respond by Grassley's May 1 deadline.\n\n___\n\nAP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Eraldo Peres, File)\n\nBELEM, Brazil (AP) - For the last few years, climate scientists, environmentalists and Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva have been talking up the first U.N. climate conference to be held in the Amazon . The largest tropical forest in the world stores huge amounts of planet-warming greenhouse gases, making it crucial in the world's fight against climate change.\n\nAs COP29 ends all eyes turn to the upcoming COP30 in Belem, the first U.N. climate conference in the Amazon. Many tout the host destination as symbolizing the forest's key role in combating climate change. But when tens of thousands of participants arrive in the host city of Belem next year, they won't find idyllic images of rainforest, like lush vegetation and clean rivers. (AP video by Alan K. Guimarães)\n\nIn addition to the symbolism of hosting in the Amazon, COP30, as the climate talks are called, will be a pivotal gathering because nations must come with updated plans to reduce emissions.\n\nBut when tens of thousands of participants arrive in the host city of Belem next year, they won't find idyllic images of rainforest, like lush vegetation and clean rivers. In Belem, impoverished, crime-ridden and filled with inequalities, most of the 2.5 million residents live in slums. What's more, only 2% of the city's sewage gets treated, imposing a heavy toll on its 14 river basins.\n\nThe Tucunduba River flows along the Federal University of Para in Belem, Brazil, Sept. 27, 2024. (AP Photo/Paulo Santos)\n\nSince it was designated host two years ago, this bustling metropolitan area near the Amazon River has been racing to prepare. In several parts of the city, construction hoardings bearing \"COP30\" signs surround buildings. Three major hotels are under development, but that won't provide enough rooms, so organizers plan to get cruise ships that can house up to 5,000 people. Brazil's government estimates that 50,000 people will attend COP30, including up to 150 heads of state.\n\nCOP30 will also serve as a test for Lula's commitment to preserving the Amazon. When he was elected for a third term in 2022, the leftist leader was celebrated for promises to curb the explosion of deforestation that occurred during the far-right government of President Jair Bolsonaro.\n\nWhile Lula's administration has sharply reduced the rate of forest destruction, the Brazilian leader has made statements in favor of two of the most controversial projects in the region: opening the mouth of the Amazon River for large oil exploration and paving a highway that cuts through the most preserved section of the rainforest.\n\nConstruction workers make progress in Belem, Brazil, Sept. 24, 2024, on a project for the COP30 U.N. Climate Summit. (AP Photo/Paulo Santos)\n\nConstruction workers walk around Parque da Cidade, or City Park, in Belem, Brazil, Sept. 24, 2024, a project being built for the COP30 U.N. Climate Summit. (AP Photo/Paulo Santos)\n\nThe state government of Para has launched some 30 infrastructure projects that range from tourism to urban development.\n\nOne of the largest is Parque da Cidade, or City Park, spanning 500,000 square meters (123 acres) atop a former airfield. It will feature a museum, restaurants and walking and cycling trails. After serving as a venue for COP, it will become a public space.\n\nThe project is being carried out by mining giant Vale, responsible for two of Brazil's most devastating environmental disasters , in 2015 and 2019, when waste dams collapsed in Minas Gerais state, killing 291 people and contaminating hundreds of miles of waterways.\n\nConstruction workers examine materials in Belem, Brazil, Sept. 24, 2024, at the site of a project being built for the COP30 U.N. Climate Summit. (AP Photo/Paulo Santos)\n\nIn a statement, the Para government said local legislation allows mining companies to pay a portion of mining fees in the form of public projects. It also said Vale, which operates one of the world's largest iron ore mines in this Amazon state, is in compliance with environmental laws.\n\nBelem has often been ranked as one of the most violent cities in Brazil and even the world. Organized crime and police-linked militia control parts of the city, and it's common for residents to recount robbery stories. Security will be increased during the conference, with early plans to have the military, Brazil's intelligence agency and local law enforcement agencies involved.\n\nStill, the city is used to big crowds. Every November, it hosts Procession of Our Lady of Nazareth, one of Latin America's largest religious festivities. This year, around 2 million people flocked to Belem's streets and there were no major incidents.\n\nMoreover, Brazil has hosted major international events, including the 2014 World Cup, the 2016 Summer Olympics and the historic United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, held in 1992, which set up the process of international climate negotiations.\n\nTrash sits along the banks of a tributary of the Tucunduba River in Belem, Brazil, Sept. 24, 2024. (AP Photo/Paulo Santos)\n\nThe Tucunduba River, which ends almost three miles from its headwaters into the much larger Guama River, is the receptacle of much untreated sewage and garbage as it crosses through two of Belem's poorest neighborhoods.\n\nDuring a boat trip in October, Associated Press journalists experienced foul-smelling water and saw refrigerators floating amid islands of trash that herons would land on. In the stretch next to the Terra Firme neighborhood, its banks have been taken over by stilted houses built informally.\n\n\"I used to bathe here until I was 14. There were trees around, and the water was dark and cold,\" said boatman Fabio Passos, 42. But what used to be a river is now \"a big ditch,\" he said.\n\nA refrigerator floats in a tributary of the Tucunduba River in Belem, Brazil, Sept. 24, 2024. (AP Photo/Paulo Santos)\n\nHerons land on trash in a tributary of the Tucunduba River in Belem, Brazil, Sept. 23, 2024 (AP Photo/Paulo Santos)\n\nThe river pollution is connected to Belem's chaotic growth in the past decades, when Brazil experienced a massive migration from rural to urban areas. Until the 1970s, most of the Amazon population lived in the rainforest. Today, 75% of its 28 million inhabitants are in urban areas, where poverty is widespread and drug-related violence rampant.\n\nOne of these migrants is João Maria Garcias, 55, a metalworker who moved to a squatter settlement near Tucunduba from a riverine community in 1987. In the beginning, locals caught fish and even shrimp in the river. Then, stilt houses took over the banks, bringing sewage.\n\nA father of six, Garcias said the neighborhood used to be very violent, but now he can leave work tools unguarded thanks to a criminal gang that controls the area.\n\nNatasha Reis, spokeswoman for environmental nonprofit Mandi, poses for a photo in front of construction near a river in Belem, Brazil, Sept. 24, 2024. (AP Photo/Paulo Santos)\n\n\"If somebody steals, they shoot them in the hand. Thank God it's calmer now,\" he said.\n\nIn preparation for COP, under the name of \"macro drainage,\" the state government has been installing hundreds of concrete slabs along the banks of the river and its tributaries. The project includes expanding the sewage and water supply systems and paving roads. In a statement, the state government said the effort \"will help reduce flooding problems.\"\n\nThis approach has been criticized by Mandi, a women-led nonprofit environmental group focused on Belem's rivers and climate change. It argues that to prevent flooding it would be better to restore the river's banks by planting vegetation and removing concrete, thus allowing its waters to run freely.\n\n\"The memory of the Amazonian person taking a bath in the river is fading away,\" said biologist Natasha Reis, a spokeswoman at Mandi. \"We cannot preserve what we do not love and experience. How will future generations have the desire to preserve a river that has always been a ditch for them?\"\n\nParaguassu Eleres, whose property sits along the Tucunduba River, poses for a photo Sept. 24, 2024, in Belem, Brazil. (AP Photo/Paulo Santos)\n\nOne of Mandi's educational activities is taking students to visit the Tucunduba's headwaters. The area was preserved thanks to Paraguassú Éleres, 85, a surveyor, lawyer and writer. In 1977, he bought a piece of land to build the family's house. During the construction, he ignored the engineer ́s advice and decided to preserve the headwaters, planting a garden around the 105-square-meter (1,130 square feet) pond.\n\nThe day AP visited Éleres, giant Amazon turtles swam freely in the pond on his property while a statue-like heron waited for its chance to snatch a fish from the greenish water. An oasis amid the buildings and streets, it's the only clean part of the Tucunduba River.\n\n\"There was no urban planning, and people were taking over. The headwaters are only clean because I decided to preserve them,\" said Éleres.\n\nFILE - Boats are anchored at dawn at the Ver o Peso market that is hosting the Acai Fair in Belem, Brazil, Aug. 7, 2023.

(AP Photo/Martin Meissner, File)\n\nGLASGOW, Scotland (AP) - The U.N. climate summit, known as COP26 this year, brings officials from almost 200 countries to Glasgow to haggle over the best measures to combat global warming .\n\nHere are some of the terms and key issues that will be discussed at the event, which started Sunday and is scheduled to run to Nov. 13:\n\nCOP\n\nShort for Conference of the Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change.\n\nFirst held in 1995, it also serves as the meeting of parties to the 1992 Kyoto Protocol that first committed countries to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and those that signed on to the 2015 Paris Agreement. Governments meeting in the French capital six years ago agreed on a target of keeping global warming below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), ideally no more than 1.5C (2.7F), by the end of this century compared with pre-industrial times.\n\nThe 26th conference was delayed by a year due to the coronavirus pandemic. More than 25,000 delegates are registered for the Glasgow event, which is being chaired by British official Alok Sharma.\n\nHIGH-LEVEL SEGMENT\n\nMore than 100 world leaders will attend the start of the summit Monday and Tuesday, known as the high-level segment, including U.S. President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n\nGermany's Angela Merkel, who presided over the first COP, will make one of her last international trips as chancellor, while Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is also expected to attend in person.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II and Pope Francis have canceled their trips to Glasgow, while Chinese President Xi Jinping, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro are not scheduled to go but may deliver speeches by video link.\n\nNDCs\n\nThe Paris accord set a target for limiting global warming but left it up to each country to submit its own emissions reduction targets, known as Nationally Determined Contributions.\n\nPart of the plan was for countries to regularly review and, if necessary, update their targets to ensure the Paris goal is met.\n\nGovernments were required to submit their new NDCs five years after Paris, but that deadline was quietly pushed back a year because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nPARIS RULEBOOK\n\nCountries had hoped to finalize the so-called Paris rulebook a few years after the accord was signed, but some elements of the agreement remain unfinished.\n\nThey include how countries collect and report their greenhouse gas emissions in a transparent way and how to regulate global carbon markets.\n\nCLIMATE FINANCE\n\nAmong the top issues at COP26 is the question of how poor countries will afford the expense of ditching cheap fossil fuels in favor of renewable energy while adapting to the inevitable effects of global warming already \"baked into\" the atmosphere.\n\nThere is a consensus that rich nations, whose greenhouse gas emissions are largely responsible for climate change, have to pay up. The question is how much.\n\nJUST TRANSITION\n\nMany governments have stressed that finding 'green' jobs for millions of people working in the fossil fuel industry is a challenge.\n\nThis is true for developing countries as well as for rich nations such as the United States, where coal mines and oil fields are major employers in otherwise economically depressed regions.\n\nCARBON SINKS\n\nTrees, wetlands and oceans are constantly removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\n\nCalculating how much CO2 is absorbed and stored by these carbon sinks is a key part of the climate change equation.\n\nSome countries believe they can balance out much of their emissions using their own natural resources; scientists and environmental campaigners are skeptical about the idea.\n\nTHE GRETA FACTOR\n\nSwedish climate activist Greta Thunberg has said she doesn't want to be the center of attention and other campaigners from developing countries should be heard too.\n\nBut Thunberg, who inspired the Fridays for Future youth rallies, was mobbed like a rock star by fans and journalists Saturday as she arrived in Glasgow by train.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres acknowledged that mass climate protests have put pressure on world leaders to take the issue more seriously,\n\n\"Keep pushing for action,\" he told a youth conference Saturday.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the climate talks at http://apnews.com/hub/climate\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nProtesters march during a demonstration in opposition to a new police training center, Monday, Nov. 13, 2023, in Atlanta. (AP Photo/Mike Stewart, File)\n\nATLANTA (AP) - Atlanta police have for years illegally targeted critics of a police and firefighter training center, according to a federal lawsuit filed on behalf of a protester who is one of dozens of \"Stop Cop City\" activists facing domestic terrorism and racketeering charges.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed on behalf of Jamie Marsicano, alleges that authorities view any critic of the training center as a would-be criminal and have repeatedly made arrests without cause, depriving protesters of their First Amendment rights and their civil rights protections against false arrest and malicious prosecution.\n\nThe long-brewing controversy over the training center erupted in January 2023 after state troopers who were part of a sweep of the South River Forest killed an activist who authorities said had fired at them. Numerous protests ensued, with masked vandals sometimes attacking police vehicles and construction equipment to stall the project and intimidate contractors into backing out.\n\nThough the training center is nearly complete , dozens of defendants, including Marsicano, are facing a state racketeering charge that critics have decried as heavy-handed attempts to silence the movement, which emerged in the wake of the 2020 racial justice protests. Environmental activists and anti-police demonstrators argued that uprooting acres of trees for the facility would exacerbate environmental damage in a flood-prone, majority-Black area while serving as an expensive staging ground for militarized officers to be trained in quelling social movements.\n\nMarsicano, 31, was among 23 people arrested near a music festival in DeKalb County in March 2023, hours after a group of more than 150 masked festivalgoers trekked about three-quarters of a mile (1.2 kilometers) through the South River Forest and stormed the training center's construction site, with some lighting equipment on fire as others threw objects at retreating officers. The group then returned to the festival to blend in with the crowd.\n\nAccording to an arrest warrant, authorities said Marsicano, who uses they/them pronouns, was taken into custody because they had on \"muddy clothing\" from crossing through the woods and possessed a shield, assertions that Marsicano's attorneys say are false.\n\nMarsicano's attorneys say their client was not among the group that attacked the construction site and never left the festival grounds until they were arrested while walking back to their vehicle after police ordered everyone to disperse.\n\nMarsicano was caught up in an \"indiscriminate mass arrest of legitimate festival attendees\" that was part of a pattern spearheaded by Atlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum of authorities targeting the \"Stop Cop City\" movement, according to the lawsuit, which was filed Feb. 24.\n\nMarsicano was subsequently charged with domestic terrorism and, months later, was one of 61 charged with violating Georgia's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, known as RICO.\n\nMarsicano was banned from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill campus after their arrest and completed their law degree remotely but has had difficulty finding a job and securing housing because of the charges, according to the lawsuit.\n\nMarsicano was \"publicly broadcast to the world as a 'domestic terrorist' and 'RICO co-conspirator,' forever tarnishing Plaintiff's personal and professional life,\" the lawsuit said.\n\nThe lawsuit lists more than a dozen instances in which authorities \"pretextually charged individuals deemed to be at or around Stop Cop City,\" including after a May 2022 protest where three people \"walking home were selectively stopped for carrying Stop Cop City signs,\" and taken into custody. Those arrests, as well as others, have led to civil lawsuits that are pending.\n\nMarsicano's lawsuit names various law enforcement officials as well as the city of Atlanta, which it accuses of having made a \"custom and practice\" of targeting critics of the training center.\n\nNeither the Atlanta Police Department nor a spokesperson for the city immediately responded to a request for comment.\n\nCity officials say the $115 million, 85-acre (34-hectare) campus will replace outdated, far-flung facilities and boost police morale amid hiring and retention struggles. Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens has also said that the facility will teach the \"most progressive training and curriculum in the country\" and that officials have repeatedly revised their plans to address environmental concerns.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nCanvasser Sienna Giraldi, 26, right, with the Stop Cop City Vote Coalition, talks to an Atlanta resident as she works to get signatures to force a referendum allowing voters to decide the fate of a proposed police and firefighter training center, July 20, 2023, in Atlanta (AP Photo/Brynn Anderson, File)\n\nATLANTA (AP) - A federal appeals court is considering whether to dismiss a massive citywide effort to force a vote on an Atlanta-area police and firefighter training center that city attorneys say is now \"substantially complete.\"\n\nThe 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had been silent for more than 14 months after hearing arguments in December 2023 over whether to overturn a lower court ruling that let nonresidents collect signatures as part of the \"Stop Cop City\" referendum effort. The facility is on land the city of Atlanta leased to the Atlanta Police Foundation. Opponents, who collected more than 108,000 signatures in 2023, say voters should be able to revoke that lease.\n\nIn the meantime, construction on the 85-acre (34-hectare), $115 million project continued apace last year. A spokesperson for Mayor Andre Dickens told The Associated Press on Wednesday that training has begun at the facility and classrooms are expected to be fully utilized by late March or early April.\n\nThe debate over the training center embroiled the city and captured national attention, especially after state troopers fatally shot an activist protesting near the project in January 2023. Opponents say the facility will worsen police militarization and harm the environment in a flood-prone, majority-Black neighborhood. They say the city's fight against the referendum is anti-democratic and dovetails with their concerns about a violent police response to protests and a prosecution on racketeering charges of dozens of opponents.\n\nIn response to a recent appeals court request over whether the issue is now moot, city attorneys urged the court Monday to toss the issue.\n\nThe city's attorneys wrote that police officers, firefighters and first responders have begun training at the \"state-of-the-art facility\" and \"any referendum on the ground lease ordinance will not remove the Center from the site or prevent its use by the City for these purposes.\"\n\nEven if a referendum took place, \"any outcome of such a referendum would be merely academic at this point - the Center has been built and will not be torn down,\" they added.\n\nBut attorneys for four people who live outside the city and sued for the right to collect signatures say that just because the training center has been built does not negate the primary issue - whether voters can revoke the city's 50-year lease to the Atlanta Police Foundation, the nonprofit that runs the facility.\n\n\"The lease does not terminate upon completion of construction of the training center,\" the attorneys wrote. \"That alone should end the mootness inquiry.\"\n\nThe attorneys for the facility opponents also argued that the case has an underlying First Amendment issue that must be resolved: Can nonresidents collect signatures for a referendum effort they are not eligible to vote on?\n\nKeyanna Jones, one of the plaintiffs, said she formerly lived near the training center site, which is just outside Atlanta city limits in unincorporated DeKalb County. She said collecting petitions was one of the few ways neighbors outside the city could fight the project.\n\nThe debate over nonresidents' rights to collect signatures has meant the city has not begun the costly, laborious work of analyzing the approximately 108,500 signatures that activists turned in to City Hall in September 2023. If the court tosses the case, they likely never will.\n\nEven if the appeals court does not dismiss the case because of the training center's completion, the judges could still kill the petition drive by ruling it illegal under state law, or rule all of the signatures are void because none were submitted by the original 60-day deadline of Aug. 21, 2023.\n\nA ruling just narrowing which petitions are accepted could also doom the chances that opponents will have enough signatures from eligible registered Atlanta voters to force a referendum, an analysis by The Associated Press , Georgia Public Broadcasting, WABE and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution found. Statistical sampling of 1,000 entries found it's possible opponents gathered the required 58,231 signatures if all entries are counted. But excluding signatures collected after Aug. 21, 2023, or by people who weren't Atlanta voters would disqualify 20% of potentially eligible sampled entries - likely defeating the effort.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Charlotte Kramon contributed.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that the city's attorneys filed their argument Monday, not Tuesday.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Charlotte Kramon)\n\nDECATUR, Ga. (AP) - The parents of an environmental activist who Georgia state troopers fatally shot near the site of a planned Atlanta-area police and firefighter training center filed a lawsuit Tuesday against three law enforcement officers who they say planned and carried out a police raid that led to his death.\n\nManuel Paez Terán's family says state troopers used excessive force against the 26-year-old when they fired pepper balls into the protester's tent after Paez Terán refused to leave on the morning of Jan. 18, 2023. Authorities said Paez Terán then shot at the troopers from inside the tent, wounding one of them and prompting the troopers to return fire, killing the activist.\n\nAuthorities were conducting what officials described as a \"clearing operation\" against those who for months had been camping in the woods near the DeKalb County construction site to protest what critics call \"Cop City.\"\n\nThe killing of Paez Terán, who went by the name Tortuguita and used the \"they\" pronoun, was a galvanizing moment for the \"Stop Cop City\" movement, with activists across the world holding vigils and painting murals in honor of Tortuguita, who friends said was dedicated to helping others and protecting the environment. Authorities have portrayed Paez Terán as an out-of-state radical who wrote in their journal that police officers should be killed.\n\nEver since Paez Terán's death, their parents have complained that the Georgia Bureau of Investigation has refused to give them answers about the events surrounding his death. Last year, the family commissioned an autopsy that concluded that Paez Terán was sitting cross-legged with their hands in the air when they were shot more than a dozen times.\n\n\"The story of Manuel's death is still being written,\" attorney Brian Spears said at a news conference Tuesday morning in Decatur, a few miles from where the training center is nearing completion. \"The objective of this lawsuit is to learn the truth about who planned the raid and to hold them responsible.\"\n\nPaez Terán had moved to Georgia from Florida in 2022 to join activists who had been camping in the woods and calling themselves \"forest defenders.\"\n\nThe lawsuit says GBI Special Agent Ryan Long planned a \"raid\" that targeted protesters for expressing their political beliefs, violating their First Amendment rights.\n\nThe protesters were camped out legally on public land, not on the construction site itself, the family's lawyers said, and Long was wrong to instruct officers to arrest campers for \"criminal trespass,\" thereby violating their Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\nThe lawsuit said that when Paez Terán \"stated the desire to remain in the forest,\" Trooper Mark Lamb ordered Trooper Bryland Myers to fire pepper balls into the activist's tent, trapping the protester in an enclosed space with chemicals and making Paez Terán \"reasonably believe that they were going to die.\"\n\nLamb and Myers were among the six troopers who fired their guns at the activist after Paez Terán fired at them, officials have said.\n\nA GBI spokesperson declined to comment on the pending litigation.\n\nBody camera footage from four Atlanta officers involved does not show the shooting itself, the GBI has said. But the agency said footage shows the officers encountered Paez Terán in a tent in the woods and fired in self-defense after the activist shot at troopers, injuring one, and ignored verbal commands to leave the tent.\n\nA prosecutor declined to charge the troopers who killed Paez Terán, saying their use of deadly force was \"objectively reasonable.\" Investigators have also said ballistics evidence shows the injured trooper was shot with a bullet from a gun Paez Terán legally purchased in 2020.\n\nActivists formed the \"Stop Cop City\" movement to protest the construction of an 85-acre (34-hectare) Atlanta Public Safety and Training Center, which they said would cause environmental damage by cutting down huge swathes of trees and exacerbate flooding fears in a poor, majority-Black neighborhood. They also oppose the use of tens of millions in public funding on what critics describe as being a training ground for \"urban warfare.\"\n\nInitially given a $90 million price tag, the cost has since jumped to $115 million, with taxpayer funds paying the majority of that cost, despite city officials' earlier claims that the public obligation would only be $31 million.\n\nThe city said the state-of-the-art campus would boost police morale amid hiring and retention struggles while emphasizing \"progressive\" training practices.\n\nSince the fatal encounter, Tortuguita's name has been invoked at numerous protests - some of which have turned violent, including last year when more than 100 masked activists stormed the construction site and torched equipment while others threw projectiles at retreating officers.\n\nIn September 2023, 61 protesters were indicted on racketeering charges , and dozens of activists have been charged with domestic terrorism. Attorney Jeff Filipovits said this was part of a strategy to \"demonize those who hold certain political beliefs.\"\n\n\"Forest defenders are not terrorists,\" said Paez Terán's father, Joel Paez. \"They aren't. And my child was with individuals concerned against environmental injustice.\"\n\nPaez Terán used to meditate every morning to be close to God and saw the forest as a sacred place, said their mother, Belkis Terán. In honor of Tortuguita - Spanish for \"little turtle\" - she wore a necklace with a turtle pendant to the news conference.\n\n___\n\nKramon is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Climate Summit is visible through artwork outside the venue, Tuesday, Nov. 12, 2024, in Baku, Azerbaijan. (AP Photo/Peter Dejong)\n\nBAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) - World leaders converged Tuesday at the United Nations annual climate conference with plenty of big names and powerful countries noticeably absent.\n\nPast talks often had the star power of a soccer World Cup. But the meeting just getting underway in Azerbaijan won't have the top leaders of the 13 largest carbon dioxide-polluting countries - a group responsible for more than 70% of the heat-trapping gases emitted last year.\n\n\"The people who are responsible for this are absent,\" Belarus President Aleksandr Lukashenko said during his speech at the summit. \"There's nothing to be proud about.\"\n\nThe world's biggest polluters and strongest economies - China and the United States - aren't sending their No. 1s. Neither are India and Indonesia. That's the world's four most populous nations, with more than 42% of all the world's people.\n\n\"It's symptomatic of the lack of political will to act. There's no sense of urgency,\" said climate scientist Bill Hare, CEO of Climate Analytics. He said this explains \"the absolute mess we're finding ourselves in.\"\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told world leaders who did show up that the world is seeing \"a master class in climate destruction\" in a year virtually certain to be hottest on record.\n\nBut Guterres held out hope, saying in a veiled reference to Donald Trump's re-election in the United States that the \"clean energy revolution is here. No group, no business, no government can stop it.\"\n\nUN officials said when Trump was first elected in 2016, the world had 180 gigawatts of clean energy and 700,000 electric vehicles. Now it's 600 gigawatts of clean energy and 14 million electric vehicles.\n\nHost Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev kicked off two scheduled days of world leaders' speeches by lambasting Armenia, western news media, climate activists and critics of his country's rich oil and gas history and trade, calling them hypocritical since the United States is the world's biggest oil producer. He said it was \"not fair\" to call Azerbaijan a \"petrostate\" because it produces less than 1% of the world's oil and gas.\n\nOil and gas are \"a gift of the God\" just like the sun, wind and minerals, Aliyev said. \"Countries should not be blamed for having them. And should not be blamed for bringing these resources to the market because the market needs them.\"\n\nRev. Fletcher Harper of GreenFaith, a faith-focused environmental activism group, responded by calling fossil fuels \"literally the highway to hell for billions of people and the planet.\"\n\nAliyev said his country will push hard for a green transition away from fossil fuels, \"but at the same time, we must be realistic.\"\n\nOne of the most notable leaders to make the talks is U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer. He announced an 81% emissions reduction target on 1990 levels by 2035, in line with the Paris Agreement goal to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. That's up from the 78% the U.K. had already pledged.\n\nU.K. greenhouse gas emissions have fallen by almost half from 1990 levels, mainly because of the almost complete removal of coal from electricity generation.\n\nMany climate analysts welcomed the announcement. \"It sets a strong bar for other countries,\" said Debbie Hillier, the global climate policy lead of Mercy Corps. Nick Mabey from the climate think-tank E3G said \"other nations should follow suit with high-ambition targets.\"\n\nThere's also a strong showing from the leaders of some of the world's most climate-vulnerable countries. Several small island nations presidents and over a dozen leaders from countries across Africa are speaking at the two-day World Leaders' Summit portion of the conference.\n\n\"Our forebears map the tides with sticks, coconut fronds and shells. It is in our blood to know when a tide is turning. And on climate, the tide is turning today,\" said Marshall Islands President Hilda Heine. \"Time will judge those that fail to make the transition.\"\n\nSpain Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez noted that the deadly floods in his country last month \"would have been less likely and less intense without the effect of climate change.\"\n\n\"We must ensure natural disasters do not multiply or replicate,\" he said. \"Let's do what we promised to do seven years ago in Paris.\"\n\nBarbados Prime Minister Mia Amor Mottley said the world is in \"a season of superlatives.\" Barbados was hit with destructive Hurricane Beryl earlier this year.\n\n\"These extreme weather events that the world is facing daily suggest that humanity and the planet are hurtling towards catastrophe,\" she said.\n\nUnited Nations officials downplayed the lack of head of state star power, saying that every country is represented and active in the climate talks.\n\nOne logistical issue is that next week, the leaders of the most powerful countries have to be half a world away in Brazil for the G20 meetings. The recent election in the United States, Germany's government collapse, natural disasters and personal illnesses also have kept some leaders away.\n\nThe major focus of this year's talks is climate finance - wealthier nations compensating poor countries for damages from climate change's weather extremes, helping them pay to transition their economies away from fossil fuels and helping them with adaptation.\n\n\"It's not surprising that richer nations are trying to downplay the importance of this crucial finance COP,\" said Rachel Cleetus from the Union of Concerned Scientists. \"They're trying to evade their responsibility to pay up.\"\n\nNations are negotiating over huge amounts of money, anywhere from $100 billion a year to $1.3 trillion a year. That money \"is not charity, it's an investment,\" Guterres said. \"Developing countries must not leave Baku empty-handed.\"\n\nClimate analysts welcomed an announcement by a group of 11 multilateral development banks including the World Bank and Asian Development Bank that their annual climate financing for the rest of the decade should reach $120 billion.\n\nIn the negotiations backroom, the G77 and China negotiating bloc - which includes many of the world's developing countries - put forward a demand of $1.3 trillion annual climate finance for the first time. A representative said the bloc cannot accept the framework submitted for negotiations.\n\n\"We will not get a strong new goal in Baku if it is not shaped in a way that respects the G77 positions,\" said Iskander Erzini Vernoit, director of Moroccan climate think-tank Imal Initiative for Climate and Development. \"The G77 and China are setting the agenda.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Jill Lawless contributed from London.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

(AP Photo/Ricardo Garcia Vilanova, File)\n\nThe world is heading for considerably less warming than projected a decade ago, but that good news is overwhelmed by much more pain from current climate change than scientists anticipated, experts said.\n\nThat's just one of a set of seemingly contradictory conditions facing climate negotiators who this week gather in Dubai for marathon United Nations talks that include a first-ever assessment of how well the world is doing in its battle against global warming. It's also a conference where one of the central topics will be whether fossil fuels should be phased out, but it will be run by the CEO of an oil company.\n\nKey to the session is the first \"global stocktake\" on climate, when countries look at what's happened since the 2015 Paris climate agreement , how off-track it is and probably say what's needed to get back on track.\n\nEven though emissions of heat-trapping gases are still rising every year, they're rising more slowly than projected from 2000 to 2015. Before the Paris deal, scientists at Climate Action Tracker and the United Nations Environment Programme were projecting about 3.5 degrees Celsius (6.3 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming over pre-industrial levels based on how much carbon dioxide countries were spewing and what they planned to do about it.\n\nThat 3.5 \"is totally out of the picture. It will not happen,\" said NewClimate Institute scientist Niklas Hohne, who works on Climate Action Tracker. \"Our number is 2.7 (4.9 degrees Fahrenheit). It could be even lower with pledges and with net zero targets.\"\n\nGuohua Power Station, a coal-fired power plant, operates as people sell items on a street in Dingzhou, Baoding, in the northern China's Hebei province, Friday, Nov. 10, 2023. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan)\n\nUNEP's Emissions Gap projected 2.5 to 2.9 degrees (4.5 to 5.2 degrees Fahrenheit). The global goal is 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nCountries are promising and even starting on actions that should eventually reduce emissions, but those cuts haven't materialized yet, said Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare, also of Climate Action Tracker.\n\n\"So things aren't as bad as they could have been or as we worried they might be 20 years ago, but they're still far from where we need to be,\" said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who heads scientists who annual track world emissions in the Global Carbon Project.\n\nWhen he looks at the impacts of just 1.1 degrees Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming - about what the world has gotten so far - World Resources Institute CEO Ani Dasgupta said he wants to scream from the rooftops about how \"unfair and unequal the devastation is.\"\n\n\"No one who has half a brain can be happy where we are,\" Dasgupta said.\n\nFILE - Activists, some from Extinction Rebellion shout slogans against global warming when blocking a busy road in The Hague, Netherlands, Jan. 28, 2023. (AP Photo/Peter Dejong, File)\n\nScientists underestimated for decades how much destruction just a little warming would cause, several scientists said. And that damage we are feeling far outweighs the gains made in reducing future warming projections, they said.\n\nHare points to more than 60,000 heat deaths in Europe in 2022 . Others point to thousands dead from flooding in Pakistan and Libya.\n\n\"The more we know, the more severe impacts we see at lower temperature changes,\" said Anne Olhoff, chief author of the UNEP Emissions Gap report. \"The impacts happen much faster than we thought previously and much harder than we thought previously.\"\n\nThe damage the world is seeing \"is scarier to me than almost anything else,\" Jackson said. \"We are seeing the world's weather start to unravel and there's no evidence that that will stop.\"\n\nWhen it comes to emissions, the key is what's causing them, experts say, citing fossil fuels.\n\n\"I think rightly the fundamental role of fossil fuels will take center stage\" at the Dubai negotiations, called \"COP\" for conference of parties, said Melanie Robinson, climate director for World Resources Institute.\n\nSultan al-Jaber, the COP28 President-Designate and UAE's Special Envoy for Climate Change, talks during the ADIPEC, Oil and Energy exhibition and conference in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, Oct. 2, 2023. (AP Photo/Kamran Jebreili)\n\nHeading into negotiations, world leaders have crowed about tentative agreements to triple the amount of renewable energy use and double energy efficiency. But that's not enough, said Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Research.\n\n\"It requires the tearing out the poisoned root of the climate crisis: fossil fuels,\" said United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.\n\nGuterres, numerous climate scientists and environmental activists all say what's needed is a phase-out - or at the very least a phase-down - of coal, oil and gas.\n\nBut the host country runs the negotiations and appoints a president. The host country is the oil state United Arab Emirates and it has named ADNOC oil company CEO Sultan al-Jaber, who also runs a renewable energy company, as the conference president. Al-Jaber and his colleagues say by bringing fossil fuel companies to the table they can get more done and that it may take someone in the industry to get the concessions needed.\n\nEnvironmental activists don't believe it.\n\n\"We cannot trust these politicians and we cannot trust the processes of the COPs because the fossil fuel industries are tightening their grip around their processes and dictating their outcomes,\" youth environmental activist Greta Thunberg said.\n\nThe process is in the hands of parties or nations and because of the COP rules it has to be by consensus or practically unanimous so that makes a phase-out of fossil fuels agreement unlikely, but a \"phase-down of fossil fuels is inevitable,\" said Adnan Amir, the UAE's No.2 official for the climate talks.\n\n\"There are many different views on the fossil fuels language from many different parties and how exactly we will land it will be about how we get the right formulation,'' said COP28 Director-General Majid Al Suwaidi. \"I think the sentiment is all the same. The language here that we're seeing between parties is really much closer than we've seen in the past.\"\n\nNew Climate Institute's Hohne said a phase-out is needed but doesn't think Al Jaber will allow it: \"He would basically have to agree that the basis of his business model of his company would be eliminated.\"\n\nHohne, Hare, Dasgupta and others look at al-Jaber and others' heavy promotion of carbon capture and storage - technology that the scientists say hasn't proven itself -- and they worry that the climate talks will look like something significant has been accomplished when it actually hasn't.\n\n\"I think there's a high risk that it (negotiations) ends up in greenwashing, in just looking nice but not leading to much,\" Hohne said.\n\nActivists and even United Nations officials also said they are disturbed by countries pointing to their efforts to reduce coal and increase renewable energy, as they also approve new oil and gas drilling projects, especially after Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nA report by the activist Center for Biological Diversity said that while new efforts by the Biden Administration in its Inflation Reduction Act would reduce nearly 1 billion metric tons of carbon emissions by 2030, 17 different oil and gas projects it has approved would add 1.6 billion metric tons of emissions.\n\n\"Governments can't keep pledging to cut commitments to cut emissions under the Paris Agreement and then greenlighting huge fossil fuel projects,\" UNEP Director Inger Andersen said. \"This is throwing the global energy transition and humanity's future into question.\"\n\n___\n\nRead more of AP's climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment.\n\n___\n\nFollow Seth Borenstein on X, formerly known as Twitter, at @borenbears\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

      "text": "What Is Anyone Really Doing at COP?\n\nThe UN climate summit is the one place the countries suffering most from climate change can face down the countries causing it.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nThe size of COP28 is hard to comprehend, even from the ground. More than 97,000 people have registered, according to the massive spreadsheet of expected participants, enough to populate a small city. The campus and its temporary denizens feel like a city too. Meetings are spread out across nearly 100 buildings , all with the freshly built feeling one expects from Dubai. During the day and into sunset, the main promenades look like the sidewalks of Midtown Manhattan at rush hour; they spoke outward from a giant geodesic dome that emits spa-like tone sounds and glows different colors at night.\n\nThousands of the people here are country delegates, and thousands more are climate experts in various capacities-representatives from Indigenous communities in full traditional regalia, policy people, activists, nonprofits, journalists. At least 2,400 of them are fossil-fuel lobbyists, according to one estimate. Milk lobbyists are evidently also here, because two dairy-trade organizations held a side event on Tuesday to extol the virtues of animal-sourced food. The aviation industry, the banking industry, the computer industry, and surely many others are also present. Only a fraction of those gathered here will be in the closed-door negotiating rooms where the international agreements are born. The rest will jostle at the sidelines, hold panels, and raise topics that will perhaps slither onto the official agenda at some future COP.\n\nAnd so it has gone, since the very first, much smaller COP. The 28 years of COPing have produced a culture and acronym-heavy language specific to this gathering, an ecosystem that arises fully formed each year, like a crisp-dried resurrection fern doused in water. \"Is this your first COP?\" \"I've been doing this since Madrid.\" \"Ah, I've been here since Marrakech\" is a common way of starting conversations. Most people here have devoted their life and career to climate policy, and the overwhelming sense is that the efforts of this ephemeral city are in absolute earnest. People sit in groups of two or five on the carpeted floors, drinking coffee and talking intensely. Tiny, cash-strapped nations have sprung for official pavilions. The mood is serious and concentrated, the days long and exhausting.\n\nYet all of this earnestness has gotten the world very little. After a couple of days of watching tens of thousands of people go about this business, one might feel like shouting: What is everyone doing here? After nearly 30 years of COPs, we are globally in our worst position ever. The collective impetus toward self-preservation has been at least partly eclipsed by other interests. Emissions and fossil-fuel use are still going up . The United Nations declared this year the hottest on record as the meeting began . This COP in particular risks being overshadowed by its incongruous host: a national-oil-company executive in a petrostate who called an emergency press briefing on the meeting's fifth day to explain away his two-week-old comment that phasing out fossil fuels would not get the world to its stated goal of keeping warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius. (Climate science disagrees.) A few buildings down from that auditorium, the OPEC pavilion-housed in the same building as the Indigenous People's Pavilion-gave out the organization's monthly oil-market report to passersby. \"Global oil market fundamentals remain strong despite exaggerated negative sentiments,\" the cover read. Sunday was \"Health Day\" at COP, and at the pavilion's entrance, someone had propped a small chalkboard on an art easel, with the words Health and Oil written in childlike block letters. I wondered about the art direction: Was it suggesting a connection between children's health and oil, and, if so, what? A scathing article in the medical journal The Lancet had just called any COP28 agreement that did not include the phaseout of fossil fuels \" health-washing \" and \"an act of negligence.\"\n\nGetting language about phasing out all fossil fuels into this year's final agreement would be a major coup, but the bigwig countries are leaning against that outcome-or at least they were when negotiations began this week. But the people cloistered in the negotiating rooms still have seven days to work that out. I was reminded why we were all still doing this at a press conference on Monday with the Association of Small Island States, or AOSIS, an important negotiating bloc at COP that was instrumental in pushing for the loss-and-damage fund, which was launched on the first day of this meeting. The fund can be understood as a form of reparations, infusing the countries suffering the worst consequences of climate change with cash from those most responsible. Researchers estimate that losses and damages so far in 55 of the most climate-vulnerable economies total more than $500 billion; initial pledges into the fund were in the hundreds of millions . The U.S. said that it intends to give $17.5 million.\n\nRead: Something big just happened at COP\n\nMichai Robertson, one of the lead negotiators for AOSIS and an environmental official for Antigua and Barbuda, told reporters that someone-he didn't say who-had asked about his feelings on the fund; he replied that he was still waiting for follow-through. \"That doesn't sound like you're being grateful,\" the person replied. This was in a \"diplomatic setting,\" so Robertson gave a diplomatic answer, he said. But he was shocked enough that he spent the next two days thinking about the exchange and what it meant-that inside negotiating rooms, larger and wealthier countries were now tacitly saying to small islands and the least-developed states: \"You got what you want. Now be quiet.\"\n\nBut, he said, \"we don't want a loss-and-damage fund\"; it is just simply necessary. In places such as Antigua and Barbuda, life is becoming more expensive and treacherous due to damage from climate-juiced storms, flooding, and drought. Robertson spent seven years of his career pushing for the creation of the fund, a depressing job at best. \"No one chooses this out of wanting to do it,\" he said. You just don't have any other choice when you're representing a place that may cease to be livable if the world breaches 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming. \"And then to be told that you should be grateful for it?\"\n\n\"At this COP the message has to be not that we're grateful, not that we're going to be quiet, but that we're going to ramp up the fight, because we absolutely cannot give up now,\" Robertson said. For the many low-lying islands that make up AOSIS, the threat is truly existential, about basic survival. It's also a preview of what the rest of the world is likely to face, only much later.\n\nCOP is the only venue where the tiniest nations can sit beside the world's giants-the U.S., China, and the European Union-and be taken seriously on climate change. \"The current process is not perfect, but is the only one available for us,\" Fatumanava-o-Upolu III Dr Pa'olelei Luteru, the permanent representative of Samoa to the UN and the chair of the alliance, told me after the press conference. At the same time, he finds it ridiculous that issues are constantly pushed to the next COP, to the next year, when the threats that island states face are time-limited and always getting worse. \"We always seem to be talking,\" he said. \"When you go home they say, 'What the hell did you do there?'\" he added. \"Sometimes you feel embarrassed.\"\n\nRead: The climate can't afford another Trump presidency\n\nThis COP may be the last chance for the world to make commitments to keep warming at a threshold where many of these island states could survive. Already, some islands are planning to need to relocate people. Tuvalu made a deal with Australia to accept 280 Tuvaluans a year. The Marshall Islands surveyed its citizens and found that very few of them had any interest in leaving; the country released a national adaptation plan at COP today and is asking for $35 billion to give people a chance at being able to stay. If warming is permitted to accelerate, plans like these would only become more expensive. And, eventually, the people living in these places would all have to go somewhere else.\n\nOn Tuesday, a draft text of a document that will guide all countries' climate policies for the next several years was released from inside those same negotiating rooms that Robertson was referring to. In its section on fossil fuels, it listed three options:\n\nOption 1 : An orderly and just phase out of fossil fuels;\n\nOption 2 : Accelerating efforts towards phasing out unabated fossil fuels and to rapidly reducing their use so as to achieve net-zero CO2 in energy systems by or around mid-century;\n\nOption 3 : no text\n\nArguably, only the first option, which the U.S. and several other major oil-producing countries currently oppose, offers any measure of protection for small island states. Saudi Arabia has said it would \"absolutely not\" accept that language , and that stance alone would block it, given COP's requirement for consensus. The oil producers generally prefer the second option, which is understood to codify abatement technologies such as carbon capture and storage to be essentially attached to oil and gas drilling. That technology has yet to be proven to work at scale and would deal with only a small portion of emissions from fossil fuels, even if it could be scaled up to its maximum potential. Over the next week and a half, the final text will be hammered out. That's why this conference exists, in the end-not for the panels, not for the side discussions, but for the talks happening in the closed rooms, where Samoa or Palau or Vanuatu or the Marshall Islands can make a case that they not be collateral damage in a world seemingly intent on ensuring the opposite."

      "text": "Cop Asks for Man's License, Shoots Him When He Reaches for It\n\nThe dashboard-camera footage from the stop is so egregious that it caused the highway patrolman to be charged with aggravated assault.\n\nIn the era before cheap video technology, this would be a story about a police officer who reported that he shot a man during a traffic stop when the man dove into his car to grab a weapon. Absent images, many people would give the police officer the benefit of the doubt, even when the motorist turned out to be unarmed, on the theory that cops have no reason to shoot men who comply with their orders. The motorist's behavior would be described as erratic and aggressive. People would believe that the cop reasonably feared for his life before shooting his gun.\n\nBut this is the era of the dash cam. So this is a story about South Carolina Highway Patrol officer Sean Groubert being charged with armed aggravated assault .\n\nOn September 4, he pulled over Levar Jones, who is black. He asked Jones, who was standing beside his vehicle, for his driver's license. Jones turned and reached into his car to retrieve it. And that's when the police officer panicked and started firing. All three shots are egregious, but take a particularly close look at shots two and three:\n\nWhat can one feel watching that display of reckless ineptitude save for anger, shock, and confusion? The incredulity of the victim is itself a powerful rebuke to the shooter. About the only thing one can say for the highway patrolman is that he doesn't seem as though he was trying to murder the motorist. He seems to have felt genuine fear, though it doesn't come close to being \"reasonable.\" As video footage proliferates, people will continue to see more cases where police officers behave badly to a degree that many wouldn't have believed sans images. One hopes this will eventually lead to better training and fewer incidents.\n\nFor now, it is leading to increased accountability that's long overdue, and serving as a hint to police brass that dashboard cameras are cheap enough now to be a moral imperative."

Shem Walker came out on his stoop in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn to find a man sitting on it. He apparently asked the guy to move. The guy didn't respond. Walker apparently tried to move him with physical force. Turns out the guy was a cop. The cop shot and killed Walker.\n\nClinton Hill isn't what it was in the 80s, but I know the neighborhood, and I could easily see myself in exactly that same situation. The hood consensus, among responsible adults, is that if someone's sitting on your stoop who you don't know, they need to get moving. And quickly. Otherwise, you might find yourself mixed up in someone else's drug bust. It's the same thing when you see kids leaning on your car. They need to keep it moving, less you get tangled up in their business.\n\nWhat continues to amaze me about these cops, is how they seem to, all at once, lack basic street sense and basic training. Why are you sitting on some dude's stoop, in Clinton Hill, in the first place? With earphones on, no less? You're just asking for beef. Why are you pulling out a gun and shooting someone over a fist fight? You're a cop, for God's sake. Why do you think pulling a gun and saying \"Freeze, police!\" but not showing any fucking ID, is gonna work? Don't they know that any drug dealer could do the same thing?\n\nI don't understand it."

      "text": "Rogue-Cop Movies' Winter of Irrelevance\n\nStallone, Schwarzenegger, Willis, and their modern-day counterparts will dominate theaters the next few weeks-but their brand of action film is going extinct.\n\nIf you watched Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger share a podium at last Sunday's Golden Globe Awards, you'd be forgiven for thinking you'd been transported back to the 1980s. Then again, that thought might be familiar to anyone visiting the multiplexes these days. In the next six weeks, movies starring Arnold Schwarzenegger ( The Last Stand ), Bruce Willis ( A Good Day to Die Hard ), and Sylvester Stallone (Bullet to the Head) will compete for space on your local marquee. And don't forget about the 3D rerelease of Top Gun on February 8.\n\nEach of these films is a throwback to a genre these stars perfected in the 1980s: the Rogue Cop action movie. In them, an officer of the law or member of the armed forces ignores the wishes of his oppressive, stupid bosses and catches the bad guy using methods just outside of the law. Does these films' sudden proliferation in theaters reflect a blossoming return to the anti-government, pro-military cultural zeitgeist of the Reagan era? Actually, the opposite: These movies are throwaways, representing the last gasp of a brand of entertainment whose commercial viability appears to be waning.\n\nIn the '80s, as Reagan promoted an economic plan based on free enterprise and individualism and urged a massive buildup in defense spending, action stars sometimes seemed to function as the administration's public face. Stallone's Rambo trilogy refought and won the Vietnam War, cultivating support for more military spending; in Commando , Schwarzenegger waged a one-man campaign against a communist dictator in South America; and in the first Die Hard , Bruce Willis defied the wishes of the local police and the federal government, defeating German and Japanese bad guys, while winning back his ex-wife who had left him to join the workforce. These reactionary movies railed against government intrusion and offered a solution in the form of vigilante justice.\n\nThe new Rogue Cop movies seem to offer the same solutions-mindless violence, not-so-witty action-hero quips, and high body counts-to the problems of today. A Good Day to Die Hard transposes post-9/11 politics onto a Cold War template, as hero John McClane travels to Russia to battle terrorists with a nuclear bomb. The Last Stand , which opens today, offers an anti-immigration allegory, with Schwarzenegger's small-town border sheriff as the last line of defense against an escaped Mexican drug kingpin trying to ram his way back into Mexico. Bullet to the Head tells the story of a rogue cop who teams up with a hitman to solve a murder.\n\nIt's significant that these films are being released in January and February, a dumping ground for movies that aren't good enough to earn a prime release date the year before. Last year at this time, Scott Meslow here at The Atlantic quoted the editor of Box Office Mojo saying that, \"January typically sees genre films and films that have tested poorly getting their contractually-due theatrical release, while discerning adult audiences are catching up on the various 10-best lists and the general moviegoers are seeing the event films of December.\" Meslow noted that since 2004, the top-grossing film in January has generally made less than half the total box-office take of the top-grossing film in December.\n\nAnd this crop of Rogue Cop films may be of varying quality. But they're also out of step with their times. The more-successful recent action films have been more forward-thinking. It's true that the protagonists of The Hunger Games, The Avengers, and The Dark Knight Rises could all be labeled \"rogues,\" but their heroes achieve their victories through cunning, persuasion, and a degree of teamwork-not brute force. This coming summer, multiplexes will be filled with more contemplative action movies like After Earth and World War Z , which are meant to appeal to the widest possible audience but also appear to tether their violence to some sense of larger moral action.\n\nThe action titles out in early 2013, meanwhile, find themselves disadvantaged because of American current events. Gangster Squad , now in theaters, is a prime example. The bloody flick-featuring a team of rogue cops and gangster played by the likes of Sean Penn and Ryan Gosling-was pushed back from its original September 2012 release date because one of its scenes too closely resembled the shooting in Aurora, Colorado. The studio moved the release to January, unaware that another, even more horrifying shooting would occur just weeks before that. To date, it has made a relatively soft $21 million at the box office-just a little more than a third of its reported production budget. Likewise, Tom Cruise's Jack Reacher , in which he plays a rogue military police officer who enacts brutal revenge on an Eastern European bad guy, kicked off this season with its debut on Christmas Day. The film underperformed at the box office, and his more existential sci-fi thriller Oblivion , due out in April, is expected to do much better.\n\nThere might be a political lesson here. The Rogue Cop archetype, while popularized in the Reagan era, has been co-opted by the Republican party in the 21st century with action-hero quips of George W. Bush (\"Bring it on\"), the nickname shared by Senator John McCain and the lead character in 1986's Top Gun (Maverick) or the phrase most associated with his vice-presidential pick, Sarah Palin (\"going rogue\"). And Schwarzenegger, Willis, and Stallone, of course, are all staunch supporters of the Republican Party. That the reactionary Rogue Cop movie now seems to appeal to only a niche audience-likely the middle-aged men who grew up on Willis, Stallone, and Schwarzenegger in the 1980s-might be yet another sign on this inauguration weekend that while a new generation is trying to move forward, the aging rogues of the 1980s are just trying to stay alive."

      "text": "The End of the Fictional Cop\n\nTelevision and film helped naturalize police violence. Noir offers a way out.\n\nPhotographs by Devin Yalkin\n\nD etective Elliot Stabler walks into an empty interrogation room with purpose. He'll soon be questioning a perp who beat murder and rape charges 14 years ago, and he can't afford a repeat, so he gives himself the edge. He cranks the thermostat up 20 degrees; he removes the screw from a chair, giving it a wobble; he swivels the light bulbs slightly out of place so the lighting flickers. With these tweaks, a confession is nigh. Yes, this is coercive, but it's okay-he's one of the good guys.\n\nBefore months of protests against police brutality renewed scrutiny of law enforcement, many Americans might have seen the Law & Order: SVU detective's coercion as noble. Now the tide is turning , and taking cop shows with it. In June, Cops , the documentary ride-along show that took viewers to the front lines of the wars on drugs, poverty, and driving while Black, was canceled by the Paramount Network. The same fate befell A&E's Live PD , a hugely popular successor to Cops . Discovery's Body Cam , another spin on the gonzo-cop formula, has not aired since the end of June; on social media, fans await news of its fate with dread.\n\nShows about fictional police officers remain on air, but many of their creators are newly self-conscious. On Twitter, Tom Scharpling, an executive producer for Monk , lamented that he had \"contributed to the larger acceptance that cops are implicitly the good guys.\" The former Law & Order: SVU showrunner Neal Baer expressed regret that Detective Stabler \"was smacking people around\" while doing police work. (In \"Rage,\" the SVU episode described above, Stabler spits on a suspect.) Cast members and the showrunner of the sitcom Brooklyn Nine-Nine donated $100,000 to the National Bail Fund Network; Stephanie Beatriz, an actor on the show, almost sounded like she was tithing. \"If you make tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in residuals from playing a cop?\" she tweeted . \"I'll let you do the math.\"\n\nSome critics have suggested the problem with cop stories amounts to a detachment from real crime statistics or the history of policing. Cord Jefferson, a writer on the HBO series Watchmen , advanced this argument in a recent interview with Variety . In his view, writers downplay the racism in police forces, something Watchmen does not do: \"We didn't want to shy away from the fact that in many places in America, members of the police were also members of the Klan. There are absolutely many parts of America where that is still a problem today.\"\n\nRead: Saying goodby to Law & Order\n\nCourtney A. Kemp, the showrunner of Power , expressed a similar sentiment in a Hollywood Reporter op-ed: \"On TV-unlike reality-rarely is someone arrested because of his/her/their race.\" In her view, hard facts would undermine the valor that cop shows sell to keep viewers hooked; if cops are racists, they are no longer heroes. The only way to dispel that fantasy, she argued, is to fill writer's rooms and executive suites with people who can't afford to perpetuate it.\n\nGiven the pause in television production due to COVID-19, it may take years to see whether creators act on their guilt and transform depictions of policing in Hollywood. In the meantime, there is already a model for telling complex stories of danger, morality, and community without centering folks with badges and guns: noir.\n\nOnce a niche film genre about hard-boiled detectives, noir has grown into a broad narrative tradition that explores moral ambiguity and spans literature, comics, and video games. In those works, the mechanics that make police stories so appealing have been steadily untethered from cops-and sometimes even crime. Rather than reforming portrayals of policing to be more balanced, realistic, or diverse, noir writers have gradually dispensed with cops altogether. That makes noir a useful blueprint for a society that is changing its relationship with policing.\n\nfrom a storytelling standpoint , cop fiction pushes all the right buttons. Police forces have a unique license to gather evidence, identify suspects, and pursue leads-a combination of skills that makes them narrative machines. For a single case, police might visit a pizza shop, raid a brothel, lock down a hospital, and surveil a parking lot. In pursuit of a suspect, there might be a foot chase, a fist fight, and an interrogation. The possibilities are endless-and that's the point. A cop's workplace is the case; their duties take them everywhere. That mobility offers an infinite range of settings, characters, and twists.\n\nThe best cop stories probe the ambivalence of police power. Justified , which stars Timothy Olyphant as Deputy U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens, begins with Givens as a gunslinging cowboy, but he quickly learns to utilize other tools. Though shootings can be ruled \"justified\" upon internal review, his gun narrows the potential outcomes of an encounter with a suspect. Every time he fires or even brandishes his gun, he risks revealing himself as an angry, destructive brute; when he doesn't shoot, he proves his cleverness and empathy.\n\nRead: The unreality of Cops\n\nThat will-he/won't-he dynamic is the heart of the show. Most episodes are split so that the villain of the week pursues an objective as much as Givens does. The marshal struggles to avoid pulling the trigger, and his marks wrestle with the choice between flight and surrender. That constant tension makes Justified great television, and excellent noir, because it blurs the line between police officers and the people they pursue. But even with its ambivalence, Justified tacitly naturalizes the police, like most cop stories do. Cases keep coming in. Crime never recedes. Cops are always needed. Rather than mission creep, there's mission inertia, crime fighters and criminals re-spawning in an infinite loop.\n\nAt the level of archetype, fiction has mined every species of cop: dirty, crooked, straight, renegade, superhero, consultant, dog, mall, Robo. Even at the level of genus, the numbers are stifling: vice, SWAT, major crimes, sexual crimes, precincts, homicide detectives, criminal profilers, ad infinitum. As the activist Rashad Robinson (who petitioned for Cops to be canceled back in 2013, when it was on Fox) recently told NPR, \"the cop character is the most overdeveloped character on TV.\" We've reached peak cop.\n\nNoir is best known for femmes fatales, despondent PIs, and chiaroscuro lighting, but it's also become a lens for zooming in on the inner workings of a community. The film A Most Violent Year , for instance, follows businessman Abel Morales as he attempts to close a huge property purchase without resorting to violence. It's set in New York City in 1981, a year in which the city's murder rate reached a record high . Morales feels the ambient pressure as the drivers of his fleet of oil-delivery trucks are threatened by armed hijackers. As Morales attempts to close his deal, we see him haggle with his scheming rivals in the oil industry; fight with his trigger-happy wife, who is the daughter of a Brooklyn gangster; and outwit a crooked district attorney. Throughout the film, Morales's disinterest in mob-style violence, which he avoids as a matter of pride and business acumen, underscores the structural violence of his deal brokering. These maneuvers protect his business but expose his employees to physical harm, hinting at the arrogance of his aversion to violence.\n\nStructurally, the film resembles a police story. Like a cop, Morales has access to a broad range of institutions: his rivals, the DA, a bank, and so on. His meetings take him all over the city and into varied, seedy settings. He pursues leads as he investigates whether his rivals have arranged the hijackings, and he holds multiple intense interrogations, one at gunpoint. What distinguishes Abel from the standard-issue tenacious cop is that his story doesn't just revolve around the administration of justice (or the lack thereof). As he traverses the city, every interaction is a negotiation, his interlocutors as conniving as he is. He's focused on a single deal, but the world isn't defined by his mission. \" Who Is She? ,\" a satirical short story by Catherine Lacey, centers around a loiterer whose presence in a road median warps the flow of a city. She finds the median while absentmindedly investigating an outbreak of graffiti that reads who is she? and decides to linger because she \"just couldn't get up, couldn't get up or leave.\" The story's action derives from her violation of the unspoken laws of the city space. Resting in the median causes multiple people to come to her rescue, despite her lack of distress. As she is variously mistaken as homeless, a victim of domestic abuse, and a potential workout partner, her would-be saviors feel like meddling cops, their attempts to restore some preconceived order generating conflict. The story strikes me as noir because, despite its lack of crime and hilariously low stakes, the main character's listlessness is slowly revealed to be a privilege. Though the city reacts absurdly to her occupation of the median, no one calls the cops. She is out of place, but not alien, making her annoyance as bratty as it is justified.\n\nRead: Unbundle the police\n\nThe N. K. Jemisin short story \"Non-Zero Probabilities\" takes place in a bizarro New York City in which the Knicks make it to the league finals, freak accidents such as fatal train derailments are common, and dice rolls are suspiciously lucky. This uptick in improbable events causes Adele, the main character, to navigate the city with a caution that is both goofy and callous. Before she leaves home, she dons a lucky hair clasp, a Saint Christopher medal, and, depending on the day, special panties. The ensemble reads as quirky until she pulls survivors from a wrecked train that she comes across while walking to work and thinks, They should have known better .\n\nThat paranoia draws attention to all of the potential danger of the city without placing Adele in direct peril or making her a constant witness to misery. Jemisin, a world-builder par excellence, cleverly exchanges ruin-porn imagery such as dark alleys, purse snatchings, and trash-filled streets for odder sights such as a murdered black cat and double-decker buses filled with sick people hoping to magically get better. The bleakest landscape is the grim New York of Adele's mind. Terrified of dying, she avoids dating, riding the subway, breaking mirrors, and walking under ladders. Her constant mental calculus seems exhausting. By the story's end, Adele finds relief in remembering New York before the sweeping change in fortune, a realization that helps her unwind.\n\nIn all of these stories, ordinary characters navigate tricky social terrain. Americans have grown used to cops leading their expeditions through the rigmarole of existence. But their perspective is not essential. Every narrative element that gives cops agency is available to the rest of us.\n\nThere have long been parallels to cop shows that follow professions such as law, emergency response, and firefighting, and this critique applies to them too. Americans' recurring focus on these institutions seems narrowly aspirational. Stories of heroic civil servants suggest that they bear the burden of maintaining our social systems. Noir rejects that premise, both by questioning the inherent heroism of civil servants and by positing that everyone is implicated in this thing called society. (Akashic Books' series of location-based noir is perhaps the clearest distillation of this idea.)\n\nUltimately, noir is a lodestar for decentering cop stories because it embraces fallibility. The schmucks, the washouts, the paranoiacs, and the losers of noir are captivating because they fail as often as they succeed. They are cunning and clumsy, inspiring and utterly full of shit. They are manic and perfectly cognizant, sometimes so insightful it drives them mad. Above all, noir stories bend cities and professions into odd shapes, imagining worlds where communities and individuals can solve problems without summoning lawless armed militias. There are fewer heroes in noir, but far more people. I choose option two."

      "text": "When Kamala Was a Top Cop\n\nIf elected, can the candidate be trusted to hold government officials accountable and oversee a progressive criminal-justice system? Her past says no.\n\nWhen Senator Kamala Harris is criticized for actions she took as San Francisco's district attorney or as California's attorney general, the Democratic presidential hopeful responds in two ways. She cites the most progressive aspects of her record, arguing that she'll advocate in the White House for more reforms to the criminal-justice system. And she asserts that it is laudable to work for change from within broken institutions, \"at the table where the decisions are made.\"\n\nShe says very little, and nothing convincing, about some of the most serious charges against her, like that she fought hard to keep innocents in prison and failed to fight hard against corrupt cops.\n\nIf elected president, Harris seems as likely as any of her Democratic rivals, and far more likely than Donald Trump, to pursue a criminal-justice-reform agenda that overlaps with policies I favor as a civil libertarian. And I do not hold it against Harris that as a municipal and state official she enforced many laws that I regard as unjust. All the candidates now running for president will, if elected, preside over the enforcement of some laws that they and I regard as unjust.\n\nBut like her rivals, the reforms that Harris would sign into law as president would depend mostly on what Democrats in Congress could get to her desk. Far more important is how she would preside over a federal legal system and bureaucracy that is prone to frequent abuses. And her record casts significant doubts about whether she can be trusted to oversee federal law enforcement, the military, intelligence agencies, the detention of foreign prisoners, and more.\n\nThe Innocent-Man Test\n\nOn June 6, 1998, police were summoned to a bar in the San Fernando Valley where a fight had broken out. The Los Angeles Police Department officers Michael Rex and Thomas Townsend rolled into the parking lot and turned on their floodlights. They later testified that they saw Daniel Larsen, then 30, pull a long, thin object from his waistband and throw it under a vehicle; that they ordered everyone in the parking lot to get down on their knees; that they retrieved a double-edged knife with a weighted handle from beneath a car; and that they arrested Larsen, who was convicted of felony possession of a deadly weapon during a jury trial, despite protesting his innocence. Larsen had two prior felonies and was sentenced to 28 years to life.\n\nLarsen continued to proclaim his innocence, but got nowhere for years, until he became one of the few inmates chosen by the Innocence Project to benefit from its limited resources.\n\nThe petition assembled on his behalf was formidable. At trial, Larsen's defense attorney called no witnesses, having failed to do the leg work of identifying any who would help his case. But as it turned out , a man named James McNutt, a retired Army sergeant first class and former police chief, had been in the parking lot that night with his wife, Elinore, and both agreed to give sworn statements asserting that they saw a different man throw the object under the car, and that they specifically saw Larsen just standing there doing nothing.\n\nThe man that the couple saw is named William Hewitt. And he swore that's what happened, too. So did Hewitt's girlfriend, who said Hewitt sold his motorcycle shortly after the incident to bail Larsen out of prison, because Hewitt felt guilty that another man was being punished for his actions. Not only did Larsen's defense attorney fail to identify or call these witnesses; he also failed to request that the knife be examined for fingerprints and did not present a theory of third-party culpability. He was later disbarred for failing other clients.\n\nThere was, however, a procedural weakness in Larsen's petition: He filed it in 2008, long after the one-year deadline for appeals. After missing that deadline, getting federal habeas relief is difficult and rare. One must show evidence of actual innocence.\n\nIn 2009, Magistrate Judge Suzanne H. Segal finally heard testimony from the multiple witnesses who proclaimed that the knife belonged to another man. She ruled that in light of the new evidence, Larsen's case seemed to be among those \"extraordinary cases where the petitioner asserts his innocence and establishes that the court cannot have confidence in the contrary finding of guilt.\" She declared that \"no reasonable juror would have found Petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\" and that he \"clearly received ineffective assistance of counsel,\" but stopped short of declaring him to be innocent outright.\n\nOn June 14, 2010, Larsen was still in prison, but the state was ordered to either retry him within 90 days or to release him. Harris, who was elected attorney general that year, could have chosen to free the man who had already served more than a decade in prison for possessing a knife that almost certainly wasn't his.\n\nUnder her leadership, the attorney general's office instead filed an appeal attempting to block his release because he hadn't filed his claim for relief in a timely manner. It sought to keep a man in prison on procedural grounds, despite strong evidence of innocence. As a result, Larsen needlessly spent two more years in prison, until the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that he had cleared the threshold for producing proof of innocence and should be released. Even then, Harris's office continued to litigate the matter, arguing before a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit that \"one reasonable juror could still vote to convict.\" The argument failed. And Harris's office finally conceded defeat.\n\nStill, it did not quite relent.\n\nAccording to the journalist Nick Martin, the freed inmate applied to get money from the California board that compensates the wrongly imprisoned. The going rate is $140 for every day of wrongful incarceration. \"To be declared eligible for compensation, a person has to prove to the court that they deserve the money. And in order to secure that proof, one of the main requirements of the board is a recommendation from the attorney general's office,\" Martin wrote . \"When Harris' office filed their suggestion on Sept. 4, 2014 that the board should decline Larsen's claim, despite him already proving his innocence in court, that essentially sealed his financial fate.\" Martin reported last month that Larsen now lives in a small garage and relies on welfare payments.\n\nHarris's office didn't merely fight to keep a man in prison after he'd demonstrated his innocence to the satisfaction of the Innocence Project, a judge, and an appeals court. After losing, it fought to keep the newly released man from being compensated for the decade that he spent wrongfully imprisoned.\n\nHarris failed the innocent-man test.\n\nThe Disclosing-Misconduct Test\n\nIn 2010, the crime lab run by the San Francisco Police Department was rocked by a scandal when one of its three technicians was caught taking evidence--cocaine--home from work, raising the prospect of unreliable analysis and testimony in many hundreds of drug cases. It was later discovered that, even prior to the scandal, an assistant district attorney had emailed Harris' deputy at the San Francisco District Attorney's Office complaining that the technician was \"increasingly UNDEPENDABLE for testimony.\"\n\nBut even after the technician was caught taking home cocaine, neither Harris nor anyone in her office notified defense attorneys in cases in which she had examined evidence.\n\n\"A review of the case, based on court records and interviews with key players, presents a portrait of Harris scrambling to manage a crisis that her staff saw coming but for which she was unprepared,\" The Washington Post reported in March. \"It also shows how Harris, after six years as district attorney, had failed to put in place written guidelines for ensuring that defendants were informed about potentially tainted evidence and testimony that could lead to unfair convictions.\"\n\nIn fact, her office initially blamed the San Francisco police for failing to tell defense attorneys about the matter. A judge was incredulous, telling one of the assistant district attorneys, \"But it is the district attorney's office affirmative obligation. It's not the police department who has the affirmative obligation. It's the district attorney. That's who the courts look to. That's who the community looks to, to make sure all of that information constitutionally required is provided to the defense.\"\n\nHarris claimed that her staffers didn't tell her about the matter for several months.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in June that years earlier, her aides had sent her a memo urging her to adopt a policy of disclosing police misconduct to defense attorneys to safeguard the right to a fair trial. Police unions, however, were opposed to the policy, and Harris failed to act on it until after the 2010 scandal.\n\nHad she chosen otherwise, she would not have woken up to this San Francisco Chronicle story: \" Kamala Harris ' office violated defendants' rights by hiding damaging information about a police drug lab technician and was indifferent to demands that it account for its failings, a judge declared Thursday ... In a scathing ruling, the judge concluded that prosecutors had failed to fulfill their constitutional duty to tell defense attorneys about problems surrounding Deborah Madden , the now-retired technician at the heart of the cocaine-skimming scandal that led police to shut down the drug analysis section of their crime lab.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Jeff Adachi, then head of the San Francisco Public Defender's Office, declared at the time, \"Anytime I've asked the district attorney for a meeting, I've been told the district attorney is out of town or not available. We need a district attorney who will give this the attention it deserves.\"\n\nHarris failed the disclosure-of-misconduct test.\n\nThe Corrupt-Prosecutors Test\n\nFor years, R. Scott Moxley, an indefatigable alt-weekly reporter, has covered police and prosecutorial misconduct for OC Weekly , a beat that never left him short for material, and that absolutely exploded in 2014, when Harris was attorney general. As he summarized it, \"Sheriff's deputies had spent years running unconstitutional jailhouse scams against pretrial inmates to secretly secure prosecutorial victories at trials. In return, prosecutors under then-District Attorney Tony Rackauckas looked the other way when deputies hid, doctored or destroyed exculpatory evidence from defendants ; repeatedly committed perjury; and disobeyed lawfully issued court orders. Tens of thousands of pages of records inside the Orange County Superior Court, as well as at the California Court of Appeal, prove beyond a reasonable doubt each element of what became known nationally as the jailhouse-informant scandal.\"\n\nFor months, Moxley watched as details of the scandal emerged in a Santa Ana courtroom, and then as the judge declared that multiple deputies had perjured themselves on the stand. Earlier this year, he gave a scathing assessment of Harris's response, which amounted to almost nothing by the time she was elected to the Senate in 2016.\n\nAccording to Moxley:\n\nAfter more bombshell evidence emerged that expanded the scope and intensity of the deputies' cheating, [Judge] Goethals-a former homicide prosecutor-wrote another ruling expressing exasperation over the corruption.\n\nHarris finally acted.\n\nShe announced the opening of an investigation into the Orange County Sheriff's Department (OCSD). As months, then years passed, it became increasingly clear the probe was nothing more than a sham. Though efforts were made to conceal that fact from the public, illuminating details emerged. For example, Harris' investigators incredibly obeyed Orange County Sheriff's Department commands not to audio record certain statements from accused deputies.\n\nMore telling, however, is the fact that the alleged investigation long ago landed in bureaucratic oblivion. Though Goethals and the California Court of Appeal officially announced disgust with OCSD perjury years ago, the AG's office-first under Harris and now with Xavier Becerra-hasn't held anyone accountable after a probe that so far has lasted more than 1,411 days.\n\nThe probe later ended without any charges filed.\n\nMoxley went on to quote Scott Sanders, the assistant public defender who first unearthed the corrupt behavior in question. Sanders declared, \"The former attorney general's efforts in Orange County were far from a profile in courage. Her unwillingness to stand up to dishonest law enforcement will be her lasting legacy here, and the criminal-justice system will continue to pay the price for years.\"\n\nIn a separate case, Kern County prosecutor Robert Murray appended to a confession two fabricated lines that would significantly increase the potential sentence a defendant faced, then gave a falsified transcript to the defendant's attorney. When the attorney found out what happened, he filed a motion to dismiss the indictment for prosecutorial misconduct.\n\nSidney Powell reported this in The Observer :\n\nCalifornia Judge H.A. Staley got it right. He found that Mr. Murray's fabrication of \"evidence\"-falsifying the transcript of a confession during discovery and plea negotiations-was \"egregious, outrageous, and . . . shocked the conscience.\"\n\nThe trial judge saw no laughing matter-and neither should the rest of us. He dismissed the indictment completely, and in a scathing opinion, also quoted by the appellate court, wrote that the prosecutor's actions \"diluted the protections accompanying the right to counsel and ran the risk of fraudulently inducing defendant to enter a plea and forfeit his right to a jury trial.\" The court refused to \"tolerate such outrageous conduct that results in the depravation of basic fundamental constitutional rights that are designed to provide basic fairness.\"\n\nAs for Harris:\n\nUndaunted by the criminal conduct of a state prosecutor, or the district court's opinion, Ms. Harris appealed the decision dismissing the indictment. According to the California attorney general, only abject physical brutality would warrant a finding of prosecutorial misconduct and the dismissal of an indictment. Fortunately for all of us-and the Constitution-she lost again.\n\nShe failed the corrupt-prosecutors test.\n\nProgressives are divided about Kamala Harris's candidacy, with some criminal-justice reformers who started off skeptical warming to her. For example, Shaun King told BuzzFeed News , \"I was a little slow to trust her as a reformer on criminal justice, but I think she's proven herself to me. I think she's become one of the better spokespersons for really serious criminal-justice reform in the Democratic Party.\"\n\nI don't doubt that Harris will continue to champion prudent criminal-justice reforms, whether she continues in the Senate or becomes president. But speaking and even voting for sound criminal-justice policies and being a trustworthy overseer of a sprawling criminal-justice bureaucracy are very different things.\n\nI can forgive a politician a vote on a crime bill that looks ill-conceived two decades later, or a too-slow evolution toward marijuana legalization, or even a principled belief in the death penalty, something I adamantly oppose. I find it far harder to forgive fighting to keep a man in jail in the face of strong evidence of innocence, running a team of prosecutors that withholds potentially exculpatory evidence from defense attorneys, and utterly failing as the state's top prosecutor to rein in glaringly corrupt district attorneys and law enforcement.\n\nAt best, Harris displayed a pattern of striking ignorance about scandalous misconduct in hierarchies that she oversaw. And she is now asking the public to place her atop a bigger, more complicated, more powerful hierarchy, where abuses and unaccountable officials would do even more to subvert liberty and justice for all."

      "text": "What Makes a Good Cop\n\n\"Police should not police themselves.\"\n\nThis is an edition of Up for Debate, a newsletter by Conor Friedersdorf. On Wednesdays, he rounds up timely conversations and solicits reader responses to one thought-provoking question. Later, he publishes some thoughtful replies. Sign up for the newsletter here.\n\nLast week I asked, \"What is the best way forward for Americans who want to improve policing and the criminal-justice system?\"\n\nJames contends that shootings by police mostly aren't the products of \"bad apple\" cops:\n\nLike a plane crash or a nuclear-plant mishap, they are the emergent result of training, hiring, dispatch, supervision, and more, all of which can be improved. An \"event review,\" not a \"performance review\" of the cop who pulls the trigger, allows for resident participation and expert input. This is not a substitute for discipline and punishment of violators. It assumes that the discipline of a lone violator is a bad place to stop if prevention is the goal.\n\nMaryanne describes what made her late brother a good cop:\n\nMy brother Paul, a police officer for 37 years, died this past Thanksgiving Day. At Paul's wake, the constant stream of fellow officers and staff demonstrated he was loved by all, but those to whom he was the field-training officer spoke about him in a tone of reverence. Many of your readers will suggest taking a hard look at how officers are trained. I would urge a hard look at who they are trained by. Can they demonstrate not just what to do but also how to be? Here is a story shared on Paul's memorial website by one of his trainees:\n\n\"Paulie taught me the value of words over force. There is one particular incident I'll never forget involving ... a mentally unstable young man ... who had real fighting skills. The guy kept repeating he would count to three and 'kill all of us.' He would get to two several times, which caused Kline and I to prepare for battle. Paulie, with his hands in his pockets and his calming demeanor, would say just what the kid needed to hear to interrupt his violent thoughts and reset. Eventually, the kid succumbed to Paul's verbal judo and no force was required to bring the incident to a close. I'll never forget that, or Paul, for all the other good he did. As a trainer years later, I always remembered that and tried to pass it along thanks to him. RIP Paulie. You touched many lives!\"\n\nMy eulogy for Paul provided some additional context for how a beloved police field-training officer came to be the person he was and why that served his trainees and the community:\n\n\"The quality I've heard over and over again about Paul was that he was 'nice,' which is not the typical description of a cop; usually you hear good cop or bad cop , and nice cop may seem out of the norm. Often I suspected I was latching onto the word nice because he was my brother and of course I was biased. Yesterday at the wake, my biases were confirmed and I kept hearing story after story of what nice meant to his fellow officers and staff, that what most defined Paul were not the occasional events that resulted in his commendations or awards but instead his 'thousand small acts of kindness.'\"\n\nBetween the time Paul was married to his former wife and when he met and married Wei, the true love of his life, he found a very good counselor. Paul was determined not to repeat the mistakes of the past. As with many recurring adulthood patterns, the counselor saw there were roots in childhood, but a lot of it was fuzzy, and so they encouraged Paul to \"go talk to your sister.\" During that time we spent hours upon hours piecing together our childhood. Like many families, ours was touched by a depressed and alcoholic parent. The normal ebb and flow went between apparent calm and total chaos that kept us always on guard, not knowing which it would be at any given moment.\n\nBit by bit, we pieced together all the fractured moments to re-create many of the events we weren't allowed to talk about and often told to ignore as if they hadn't happened at all. At certain points, true to Paul's nature, as all the memories of craziness and chaos began to emerge, he would just get me laughing and laughing, often by inserting the phrase \"How in the world did we ever grow up to be fairly normal functioning adults?\" The evidence and statistics were clearly not in our favor, and things easily could have gone in another direction.\n\nBut we had figured out how to cope. Paul's role in our family was the \"disrupter,\" so any of you who marveled at Paul's particularly skillful and effective methods for diffusing \"domestic\" calls who think he learned this at the police academy would be only partially correct. The truth is Paul started honing those skills from the time he was about 6. He transformed the coping and challenges of a child into kindness and helpfulness as an adult.\n\nA few of you who had Paul as your field-training officer shared stories of Paul's ability to use \"Words, not force\" in his work, and I will be forever proud that \"Words, not force\" is what you most wanted to share about what you learned from him. But now I'd like to share my favorite story that Paul shared with me ... Of course it takes place in the police station.\n\nNear the end of his career, after Paul had transferred from the street to the desk, one day a woman walked in ... Paul sensed the signs of an alcoholic and he was sure this would have no small part in why the woman was there. The woman said that her teenage daughter hadn't come home the prior night and she wanted to report her as a runaway. Paul took all the information and tried to reassure the woman that he thought her daughter was probably okay and just decided to stay over at a friend's house. All the while, he was thinking to himself that he understood exactly why the daughter didn't want to be at home.\n\nI can't recall what the girl's name was, but she needs a name for this story, so I'll call her Amy. A while later, a teenage girl came into the station, walked up to Paul at the desk and just said \"I need some help.\" I suspect she was a little taken aback when Paul said \"I bet you are Amy. Your mother has already been here, but you've come to the right place, and you've come to just the right person.\" He took Amy to the back of the station and just sat and listened to her. It was no surprise to Paul that his assumptions were correct: This was a teenager struggling with a parent who was struggling with addiction.\n\nHe assured her there were safe places to share her story and get the support she needed. So they went over to the computer, where Paul helped her look up group meetings in the area. With a list in hand, Amy made a promise that she would go to the meetings, and also that she would go home. I think about Amy a lot and hope that she found the support she needed and grew up to be a \"fairly normal functioning adult.\" I can't know any of that for sure, but I do know in my heart that when she left the police station that day, she felt a little more empowered and a lot less alone because she met Paul.\n\nScott is a criminal-defense attorney and longtime critic of flaws in policing and prosecuting:\n\nFor those of us who have spent decades trying to figure out and then implement reform, the past few years have been brutal. There was a rare window of opportunity for change, when the public wasn't screaming for ever more laws, ever harsher punishments, and fewer alternatives to the historical (and failed) belief that we could punish our way out of violence, drugs, and crime. Instead, the activists took the field, indulging their fantasy ideological solutions that would neither work nor be accepted by the majority of Americans as viable solutions requiring trade-offs everyone could live with.\n\nSimplistic solutions such as \"defund,\" based on ideologically bound understandings of the problem, never stood a chance. As soon as the next \"wave\" hit, as it surely would, the pendulum would swing and we would be back to the tried-and-failed more crimes, less due process, and harsher punishments. And here we are. We squandered a once-in-a-generation (or more) opportunity for serious reform where all stakeholders reached consensus and the best, if imperfect, fixes were accepted by a majority of Americans and to everyone's benefit. Instead, we're back where we started and no one was saved.\n\nRobert urges an emphasis on accountability:\n\nEliminate qualified immunity, which renders all but the most egregious, outrageous conduct unaccountable. It is a long slog to change attitudes, but by making punishment more likely, we can change behavior. In an ideal world, we would also be able to foster a police culture where misbehavior is seen as an unacceptable stain on police as a whole and something that every effort is made to eliminate. Culture change is difficult to impossible to impose from outside, but it can occur.\n\nI am a retired physician, and I remember the '70s and early '80s when physicians circled the wagons to defend malpracticing docs but gradually began to realize that malpractice hurt people and made everyone else look bad. The profession ceased to tolerate physician misbehavior. I can't say how to make that happen in the police, but it's where they need to go.\n\nMC recommends more sunlight:\n\nThis issue is not about the failure of police departments but of the weak policing of them. I don't think policing can be improved much except by forced transparency and external enforcement of humane standards. Officers have to be more afraid of the consequences of brutality. Mandate body cameras that can't be disabled, monitored by an external office that doesn't normally work with police officers. Footage becomes publicly available, with identities suppressed.\n\nWe're horrified at police brutality whenever another video shows it. There's nothing more horrifying than how obvious it is that this behavior is normal for the ones inflicting the violence. We must bring the eyes of the public into all the dark places where that treatment was learned and practiced.\n\nJay wants police to be more active:\n\nImproved policing begins with actually enforcing the law as written. We've deemed law enforcement of smaller crimes such as shoplifting, graffiti, and small theft \"optional,\" then wondered why larger crimes continue to soar. There's little justice for criminals nor for victims in a system in which policing is optional, understaffed or harassed and harried into inertia.\n\nC. is a white cop who is married to a Black police dispatcher on a college campus:\n\nThis question haunts me because of my job, because of my wife's job, and because any children we may have will have to interact with American police as mixed-race individuals.\n\nOne morning, we had a dining-hall employee pull into our department's parking lot. She had been on her way to work on campus when her ex began following her in his car. She stopped at our department to scare him off, and to make us aware that he might show up at the dining hall to further harass her. We got information on the ex and found out that he had a warrant for misdemeanor assault (on the employee). The employee went on her way to work, and we followed to hang out in the area and keep an eye out.\n\nThe ex didn't wait long, and parked right near the employee before she had even gotten out of her car. My shift partner found him first, and when I got on scene, the ex was outside his vehicle shouting toward the employee in her car. She was having a full-blown panic attack, breathing and crying so loud I could hear her through the closed car windows. And the ex had their child in the car. Couldn't have been more than 2, and he wasn't in a proper car seat; he was standing on the backseat looking out the window.\n\nThe ex was focused on the employee, ignoring my shift partner, and started freaking out at how much she was freaking out. I was likewise concerned about her, so I went ahead and radioed for medics to be dispatched. I could tell my shift partner was trying to get in a position to handcuff the ex, but he kept sidestepping, trying to keep an eye on the employee and still shouting toward her.\n\nI knew if we went hands-on as the situation stood, it was going to be ugly (the guy was tall, like 6 foot 2, while my shift partner was a paltry 5 foot 5 and I'm an average 5 foot 10). So I got his attention and told him, \"Look, I have medics on the way to check on her, but we can only do one thing at a time, and we have information that you have a warrant out. We're still waiting for confirmation that the warrant is current and valid, but that's what we know right now. If you would have a seat in our cruiser while we wait for that info, we can have medics check her out.\"\n\nThe guy just stopped. Then he said, \"Yeah, I'm not gonna lie. I got a warrant.' He turned around and put his hands behind his back. My partner cuffed him and got him in a cruiser. I went to check on the employee, while our sergeant, who arrived during all this, retrieved the child and brought him to his mother. Medics showed up a bit later, and made sure the employee was okay.\n\nNow, standard operating procedure when arresting someone with a warrant for a violent offense is to get them in a position where you can cuff them up real quick before they even know what's happening, and then explain the situation. It's supposed to prevent the individual from even trying to fight the arrest. In this situation, though, the guy was already amped way up; we had a woman that legitimately might need medical attention and a 2-year-old toddling around the back seat of a car. If we'd gone hands-on with no explanation, he would have struggled, and we would have had to fight to get him under control while his ex hyperventilated herself into passing out and his son watched from the car. It was going to be a bad day all around. So instead, I treated the guy with respect and explained the situation point-blank. And he let us arrest him.\n\nMy shift partner, later, told me he didn't really like the way I'd handled it, and that we should've cuffed him before we told him about the warrant. I got a guy that brought his 2-year-old son with him to harass the mother of said son to let us arrest him for assault of that same mother. And my partner didn't like the way I'd handled it. If that isn't an indictment of police standard operating procedures and culture, then I don't know what is.\n\nTaylor argues that the best way forward is a relentless focus on creating and scaling up alternatives to police:\n\nWe should be thinking about crisis-response teams ( Denver's STAR program relies on social workers to respond to calls), getting police out of traffic enforcement, and civilian systems for \"welfare checks\" (that often compose up to 70 percent of a jurisdiction's 911 dispatches).\n\nThese programs take armed police out of the equation, in circumstances that most often escalate into police harassment, intimidation, abuse, and murder. They reduce harm, without any need for police-culture change, effective retraining, or functional internal accountability mechanisms.\n\nBut rebalancing public-safety budgets to rely far less on policing has not advanced, in part, because people with legitimate concerns about their safety cannot envision the world where police are not the first responders. \"What happens when I call 911 if it's not the police responding?\" Before we will have the political space we need to then limit police to a narrower role, we need to build up these alternatives in a visible way and show they are effective, giving time for them to become a routine part of a multipronged public-safety structure.\n\nJaleelah urges a more active citizenry:\n\nMonitor the police in your community. Go to city-council meetings and town halls. If police unions are blocking formal oversight, monitor them on the ground. If you see an officer yelling at a civilian, stop and record. If you see a barista threatening to call the police to remove a homeless person sleeping on a bench, try to mediate the disagreement.\n\nPolice officers may oppose civilian interference in their work. If that is the case, they should lobby their unions to make policy changes that will engender confidence in their intentions and capabilities. Until that happens, ordinary Americans' on-the-ground surveillance is the only thing that can keep cops accountable.\n\nD. H. argues that a lack of public understanding of what police work entails is an impediment to better policing:\n\nThe George Floyd situation was as close to indisputably wrong as any police-caused deaths in the past decade or so, and captured on videotape. It was clearly outrageous to keep him face down, handcuffed behind his back, and to continue to kneel on his neck while he was experiencing difficulty breathing.\n\nOther situations are not so clearly wrong, thus there is less outrage. Trying to shoehorn every deadly encounter with police into the same category as the George Floyd situation has probably hurt the cause rather than helped it, because people get outrage fatigue. We live in a violent society beset by an upsurge in violent crimes (at least in the Portland area). At this juncture, defunding the police feels more like giving free rein to criminals to prey on society, and encouraging vigilantes and militia to take policing into their own hands. \"Defund the police\" was one of the worst liberal rallying cries ever. The gun scourge in this country makes it feel very unsafe for officers and the public alike.\n\nWith the constant barrage of vitriol expressed toward the police, who would want to become a police officer? Who at retirement age would want to remain on the force? If they do not feel supported by the public, some may not feel highly motivated to protect and serve. How many quiet-quitting police officers are out there, and can you really blame them?\n\nWe cannot work up sufficient outrage to take meaningful steps to prevent mass shootings, so why would anyone think a society numb to school and church shootings might remain outraged enough to effect meaningful change to the police organizations that must respond to those?\n\nI can understand how the fear of corrupt and/or brutal police could cause a rational person to resist arrest, as could impaired judgment from mental illness or intoxication.  However, if one chooses to resist arrest, that choice will be met by force (police violence) aimed to quickly overcome that resistance and gain control of the situation. Once force is employed, situations become much more volatile and outcomes worse. But, if police do not use force, then noncompliance will be encouraged. Getting the level of force right is more difficult in real time in the field than it may look after the fact.\n\nI am not a police officer, but before retiring, I frequently represented them in civil-rights actions seeking money damages in federal court, and have a pretty good grasp on their perspective. They do have a strong sense that the public does not understand what they are called upon to do, and how they are trained to do it, and why they are trained that way (answer: survival). The way forward is thorny. The public needs to know what is and is not lawful police conduct. There is a lot of misinformation in the press, and the public deserves accurate information about persons armed and authorized to use force against them.\n\nPolice should not police themselves; indeed, no group should police itself.  Recruiting diverse panels of retired judges, public defenders, prosecutors, academics, and others knowledgeable about the law and police procedures to take testimony, gather evidence about serious police conduct complaints, and issue public reports of their findings might be a start. It could help the poor and ignorant obtain representation in meritorious cases, publicly identify transgressing offices, and discourage frivolous lawsuits where the facts show the conduct was justified. Of course, that would cost money, and panels of experts can be wrong, biased, or even corrupted.\n\nTimothy believes that guns are a big part of the problem:\n\nImproving policing is a tough problem as long as America remains a highly weaponed society. The police can't respond to a traffic situation, a domestic situation, or even a missing-child situation without fearing for their lives. Hence, they react as if any situation is or will become violent. With the proliferation of drugs, their fears are increased. There are many situations where certain drugs increase a person's sense of violence while deadening their awareness to pain or injury. That makes it really tough on the police.\n\nJon concurs, and wants police officers to advocate for more gun control:\n\nAn acute manifestation of America's gun insanity is that police departments, chiefs, sheriffs, and unions are not the most vocal supporters of gun-safety measures and laws to get guns off the streets. Where everyone (including, apparently, 6-year-olds) can possess a deadly weapon, police are not irrational to bring a sense of caution, or worse, fear, to almost every interaction, heightening tensions and leading to faster and deadlier escalations. This has contributed to more militant, violent, confrontational policing.\n\nJD worries about the mental health of police officers:\n\nI believe that the majority of those who undertake careers in law enforcement are motivated by a desire to make a positive difference. Over time, however, the soul-killing impact of repetitively dealing with humanity in its worst moments erodes empathy and altruism and generates resentment, hostility, fear, and an overarching effort to exert control.\n\nWhile our culture has made great strides in acknowledging the impact of PTSD on our veterans and others who experience trauma, only rarely does such understanding extend to law enforcement. As a former medical educator in a family-practice residency program, I recall the utility of Balint training in assisting medical-school graduates to maintain empathy and professionalism in the context of medical practices requiring them to encounter 15-20 persons a day, each seeking the best of medical care. Balint training created a context where peers could share the best and worst of their days in a judgment-free setting and, in the best of outcomes, permit them to renew their commitment.\n\nThanks to everyone who sent responses, whether or not I had space to print them--as ever, lots of great ones went unpublished. See you later this week."

Derrin, Detective Michael A. Derrin, Lt. Alex Guzman, Officer Rasheed Siyam, and Officer Christopher Bowen-plan to sue over the police chief's alleged behavior.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"I've never seen anything like this in my life,\" Patrick Toscano, the attorney who filed the claims on behalf of the police officers, said NJ.com reported.\n\nThe list of complaints detailed a toxic work culture wherein Farley thrived on pranking, insulting, and scaring officers. While some alleged offenses included relatively innocuous gags like applying ink to door handles and setting off car alarms, other more serious allegations include Farley using racial slurs, sending sex toys to an officer's house, and exposing himself to staffers.\n\nA town spokesperson denied all claims made by the officers in a statement to the Daily Beast.\n\n\"The Township of North Bergen has full confidence in Chief Robert Farley's leadership of the North Bergen Police Department and we strongly deny these false and outrageous allegations made by disgruntled officers who are resorting to attacking the reputation of a dedicated public servant to further their own selfish goals,\" the statement read.\n\nThey added, \"If these claims are advanced in a lawsuit the Township will vigorously defend North Bergen taxpayers against these blatant cash grabs and prove that the allegations are false and defamatory. In order to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest and because we are fully confident that these claims will be proven false, we have proactively referred them to the Hudson County Prosecutor's Office for review.\"\n\nMeanwhile, officers also claim that Farley's abusive behavior had been going on for years and has persisted since he was promoted as chief. Prior to this, he served with the department for 26 years, in the footsteps of his father and grandfather, who both served as deputy chiefs.\n\nWhen Farley, who makes over $228,000 a year based on pension records, first became the department's head, he made promises that his 123-member department might now call empty.\n\n\"I will strive to lead the officers of our department to be an accessible component of our community while maintaining their competency, transparency, and professionalism,\" Farley said in the statement at the time.\n\nSpecial Captain Michael F. Derrin, 59, who was assigned to Farley's office in 2023 according to court documents, claims that the chief's demeanor towards him changed in August 2024 despite their friendship.\n\n\"Chief Farley chases me around his office,\" Derrin wrote in his notice. \"After cornering me in the filing area with no further room for retreat, he sticks a hypodermic needle through my jeans into the tip of my penis.\" According to Derrin's account, the needle drew his blood.\n\nBut wait, there's more.\n\n\"The chief would shave his body hair on people's property, their persons, and their food,\" Derrin wrote. \"He was also fond of scraping fluids from his underwear onto people seated in the chief's office.\" He added that when he tried to complain to the state Attorney General's Office, a captain called him and fired him.\n\nDerrin's son, Detective Michael A. Derrin, claims he witnessed Farley unload a fistful of viagra and adderall into the coffee pot, stir it till they dissolved, and then wait for someone to drink a cup. The detective said he stuck to a K-Cup machine out of fear afterwards.\n\n\"Chief Farley has, on several occasions, pulled his pants down and defecated on the floor in front of his entire office staff,\" Lt. Alex Guzman wrote in his complaint. \"He has also left feces on the bathroom floor, apparently with the intent of having someone unknowingly step on it.\" He added that the Hudson County chief would also defecate in wastebaskets near the desks of other officers.\n\nGuzman also complained about the emotional distress his family members were subjected to when the police chief sent sex toys, intimate lotions, and gay pride flags to his home.\n\nBreaking News Intern\n\nnandika.chatterjee@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "How One Citizen Fought Back Against a Cop's Road Rage\n\nPolice work requires split-second decisions , which can lead to honest mistakes. But what happened to New Mexico motorist Mario Rosales in 2018 was something else.\n\nWhile driving home in his Ford Mustang , he legally passed a pickup truck, and the other driver started tailgating him. Road rage can be deadly, so Rosales grew concerned.\n\nNo matter which way he went, the truck stayed in his rearview mirror. Rosales eventually reached his home in Roswell, New Mexico, hoping the truck would keep going. Instead, the vehicle blocked Rosales in his driveway, and the stranger behind the wheel started yelling and cursing at him.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAt this point Rosales was not just concerned. He was scared for himself and his family members in the house.\n\nHe owned a handgun that he could lawfully open carry, so he stepped out of his Mustang with the weapon displayed on his waist. He kept his hands away from the gun in a defensive stance and remained calm.\n\nDuring the tense exchange, the assailant identified himself as a law enforcement officer, though he was driving an unmarked vehicle and wearing plainclothes with flip flops-none of which bore law enforcement insignia.\n\nRosales complied with all commands and tried to deescalate the situation, but the officer drew his weapon and pointed it at Rosales-who had done nothing wrong other than fail to use a turn signal when the officer was tailing him around every street corner.\n\nThe officer, who had his child in the passenger's seat, was fired from the Chaves County Sheriff's Office and convicted of aggravated assault and child endangerment. Yet Rosales hit a roadblock when he sued the deputy.\n\nA federal district judge agreed that if Rosales could prove his allegations, the deputy would be guilty of constitutional violations. But the judge also held that the deputy was entitled to qualified immunity, which meant Rosales was stuck.\n\nQualified immunity, a judge-made doctrine, protects government employees from civil liability unless their misconduct is \"clearly established\" in prior cases as unconstitutional. The U.S. Supreme Court said so in 1982 )\" href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.ncsl.org/civil-and-criminal-justice/qualified-immunity__;!!LsXw!TQTDIHx1JaRd4sVIXJ3KWP-wIDsjfZMEtWlMZn-kB3OTfyaX6HbjXeIMmHNXxbZU1QISkMep6CKWMdWnom_FTA$\">1982 . Since then, beneficiaries have used qualified immunity to escape accountability for torturing )\" href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.newsweek.com/prison-inmate-qualified-immunity-protect-officials-constitution-civil-rights-723943__;!!LsXw!TQTDIHx1JaRd4sVIXJ3KWP-wIDsjfZMEtWlMZn-kB3OTfyaX6HbjXeIMmHNXxbZU1QISkMep6CKWMdW6j2PPqA$\">torturing prison inmates, stealing )\" href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://ij.org/press-release/police-stole-225k-in-cash-and-coins-and-the-courts-said-okay/__;!!LsXw!TQTDIHx1JaRd4sVIXJ3KWP-wIDsjfZMEtWlMZn-kB3OTfyaX6HbjXeIMmHNXxbZU1QISkMep6CKWMdU_AENldQ$\">stealing cash, retaliating )\" href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.texastribune.org/2023/01/06/first-amendment-laredo-journalist/__;!!LsXw!TQTDIHx1JaRd4sVIXJ3KWP-wIDsjfZMEtWlMZn-kB3OTfyaX6HbjXeIMmHNXxbZU1QISkMep6CKWMdXgndSGjA$\">retaliating against critics, and hundreds of other abuses.\n\nDefenders of the doctrine say it is necessary to protect officers who make split-second decisions, so they don't hesitate when lives are on the line. Essentially, these defenders see qualified immunity as a buffer against Monday morning quarterbacks.\n\nWhat happened to Rosales blows up this narrative. The deputy who followed him home was not called by duty to defuse a threat. He was the threat. And he had ample time to think about what he was doing.\n\nOther cases show even more opportunity for careful calculation. The mayor and police chief in Castle Hills, Texas, plotted revenge against a City Council rival over a period of weeks. After hatching a plan to arrest and jail her on bogus charges )\" href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://ij.org/case/castle-hills-retaliation/__;!!LsXw!TQTDIHx1JaRd4sVIXJ3KWP-wIDsjfZMEtWlMZn-kB3OTfyaX6HbjXeIMmHNXxbZU1QISkMep6CKWMdVQT3nFvA$\">bogus charges , they had time to sleep on it before acting. Despite their slow-motion constitutional violations, they received qualified immunity.\n\nTwo additional mechanisms exist to hold government employees accountable. They can face internal discipline and criminal prosecution, which both happened in New Mexico. Yet public agencies have a poor record of policing themselves, and neither of these actions addresses constitutional violations. Only civil litigation can do that-and only if courts allow it.\n\nRather than give up, Rosales appealed with representation from our public interest law firm, the Institute for Justice.\n\nHis tenacity paid off on July 5, 2023, when the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decision granting qualified immunity. The three-judge panel recognized that courts \"can protect officers' ability to make reasonable split-second law-enforcement decisions when dealing with suspected violent criminals without protecting an officer who was himself the only violent criminal on the scene.\"\n\nThe keyword is \"reasonable,\" the standard embedded in the Fourth Amendment. Humans make mistakes when rushed, which is why quarterbacks throw interceptions. But that's not why qualified immunity exists. Competent officers acting in good faith don't need a get-out-of-jail-free card. The Constitution already protects them.\n\nThe 10th Circuit gets it. If citizens like Rosales must obey the law, then the officers who police them must obey the Constitution-especially when they act with criminal motives and have time for premeditation.\n\nMarie Miller is an attorney and Daryl James is a writer at the Institute for Justice in Arlington, Virgina.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Get a Load of the Cop's 'Injuries' Caused by Scottie Scheffler\n\nBreaking News Reporter\n\nLouisville police released photos of the \"injuries\" a cop sustained from an altercation involving the world No.1 golfer Scottie Scheffler last month-and they border on comical.\n\nScheffler had his quartet of charges, including second-degree assault of a police officer, dropped late last month, and Friday's photo release gave a glimpse into why. The \"visible injuries\" that the cop complained about consisted of a (slightly) scraped knee and wrist.\n\nAlso included was the first public glimpse of the officer's famously ripped $80 pants, which he'd claimed were \"destroyed beyond repair\" by Scheffler.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLMPD has released a bunch of previously redacted documents from the Scottie Scheffler arrest. here's the \"injury\" to the knee of Detective Bryan Gillis... and the infamous $80 pants. pic.twitter.com/b1Yb3dhloh\n\nThe new photo confirmed there was a rip in department-issued pants about the size of a bar of soap.\n\nThe officer at the center of the controversy, detective Bryan Gillis, rejected suggestions of heavy-handedness in a statement on May 29 in which he suggested he was in the right to pursue charges against Scheffler of second-degree assault of a police officer, third-degree criminal mischief, reckless driving, and disregarding traffic signals from an officer.\n\n\"To be clear, I was drug by the car, I went to the ground, and I received visible injuries to my knees and wrist,\" he said. \"I'm going to recover from it, and it will be OK.\"\n\nThat was a step back from his initial police report, in which he wrote that he was left with \"pain, swelling, and abrasions\" to his \"left wrist and knee.\"\n\nNow, Gillis is yet again at the butt of countless jokes as the ordeal continues to be an embarrassment for Louisville cops.\n\nAlong with the photos, police also released files and other notes in a 63-page report that said three cops at the scene failed to turn on their body-worn cameras while taking Scheffler into custody-a breach of department policy.\n\nThe report added that Gillis received counseling after the incident, WDRB reported. In other footage, he was heard explaining to an officer at the scene why he never activated his camera.\n\n\"No, I wasn't [recording] at the time, I wasn't expecting to be run over,\" Gillis reportedly said.\n\nThe incident took place on a rainy morning in Louisville on May 17, while Scheffler was driving to the clubhouse at the PGA Championship-a tournament he went on to finish 8th in, teeing off mere hours after he was booked into a Kentucky jail and had his mugshot taken.\n\nThere'd been a fatal accident involving a pedestrian near the clubhouse early that morning, and Gillis and other officers had been directing traffic around it. Gillis claimed that Scheffler ignored his commands and eventually ran him over, dragging him 50 feet before stopping.\n\nThat account wasn't corroborated by witnesses, as other officers said their view was blocked by a shuttle bus. ESPN reporter Jeff Darlington, who was at the scene, reported that Scheffler mistook the cops for security officers. When officers told him to stop and he didn't, \"the police officer attached himself to the vehicle. Scheffler then traveled another 10 yards before stopping the car,\" Darlington said.\n\nScheffler later described the ordeal as being \"a very chaotic situation\" and that there was \"a big misunderstanding of what I thought I was being asked to do. I never intended to disregard any of the instructions.\"\n\nSteve Romines, Scheffler's attorney, has grilled Gillis and accused him of making a false arrest. He said his client had grounds to sue the police department, but wouldn't to spare Louisville taxpayers the money and his client the headache.\n\n\"Everything that will come out will show that Scottie did absolutely nothing wrong,\" Romines said in a statement Friday. \"In that moment he wasn't sure what had happened and had been told the false story from the citation which is contradicted by multiple eye witnesses and video.\"\n\nBreaking News Reporter\n\nJosh.Fiallo@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "It's Not About Convicting a Cop. It's About Rehabbing the Police.\n\nThe world exhaled in relief and gratitude as Derek Chauvin , a murderous cop, was convicted on all three counts for kneeling on the neck of George Floyd for over nine minutes, surrounded by cops who did nothing as another unarmed Black man died while pleading for his life. However, real justice won't be achieved by securing a rare conviction of one cop. In addition to reforming the police, we must change how we talk about law enforcement, which has often terrorized the very communities it is allegedly trained to protect and serve.\n\n\"This verdict was important. But we can't fool ourselves,\" Sherrilyn Ifill, president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, told me. \"We need transformative change-the kind that comes when pressure is brought to bear on multiple fronts to upend a deeply entrenched system that is powerfully shaped by and reliant on racism, fear, and division.\"\n\nA tragic reminder of this oppressive system occurred just 20 minutes before the Chauvin verdict was announced. Ma'Khia Bryant , a 16-year-old Black teenager, was shot and killed by a Columbus, Ohio, police officer on her driveway. A video showed her holding and swinging a knife at another young woman during an altercation. The double standards of this country's policing and the resulting commentary were on full display.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIf Bryant was white, like white supremacist terrorist Dylann Roof, maybe she'd be captured alive and the police would eventually bring her food from Burger King. If she were 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse, who was illegally armed with an AR-15 and killed two unarmed protesters, maybe she'd still be alive and praised as a hero and defended by conservative media and Republican politicians . Maybe a police officer like Lt. William Kelly of Virginia would have made a $25 donation to her defense fund, writing , \"God bless. Thank you for your courage. Keep your head up. You've done nothing wrong.\"\n\nBut, she's Black, so she was immediately shot and killed. She's dead, just like 20-year old Daunte Wright of Minneapolis. He was recently pulled over for having air fresheners hanging from his rearview mirror and killed when the officer says she mistook her gun for her taser and unleashed \"an accidental discharge.\" Violence and unnecessary aggression seem to be accidentally discharged often against people of color.\n\n\"We use law enforcement to do the things we don't want to see, to the people we don't want to know exist,\" Dr. Phillip Atiba Goff, Co-founder and CEO of the Center for Policing Equity, told me. \"If we continue to use law enforcement to engage in low-level enforcement where they show up with badges and guns, what do you think will happen? You have introduced a gun to a traffic stop when you could have introduced a ticket in the mail. Someone bought a pack of cigarettes and sold them individually, you can send them a ticket in the mail. You don't have to choke them until they die.\" That's what happened in 2014 to Eric Garner, whose dying words were, \"I can't breathe.\"\n\nSince 2015, there have been more than 5,000 fatal shootings by on-duty police officers in the United States. Black Americans and Hispanic Americans are shot at a disproportionate rate, with Black Americans being shot at twice the rate of white Americans. In a sane country that valued its Black and brown residents, this violence would be seen and aggressively confronted as an epidemic in need of an immediate cure. Instead, in America, we use neutered euphemisms like \"bad apples\" to focus on individual cops instead of overhauling a system that has repeatedly produced and condoned violence.\n\nA bad apple didn't tell cops that sex after killing a person \"is the best sex\" and one of the \"perks that come with the job.\" That's David Grossman, America's #1 police trainer, who tells officers they are \"at war\" on the streets. He focuses on the concept of \"killology\" to \"emotionally, spiritually, psychologically\" prepare officers to kill people on the job with less hesitation. A fruit basket didn't pull a weapon on an unarmed Black and Latino Army lieutenant in uniform for a routine traffic stop, threaten to murder him, and then pepper spray him. Those were two Virginia police officers . An apple orchard didn't participate in the violent insurrection that overtook the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 and resulted in five deaths, which included Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick. Those were dozens of police officers who were part of the mob or suspected of helping the mob that unsuccessfully tried to cancel a free and fair election. A senior leader of the Oath Keepers, a far-right militia whose members participated in the insurrection, bragged to 60 Minutes their group receives training from active-duty law enforcement officials . Nearly 15 years ago, the FBI warned of white supremacists infiltrating law enforcement .\n\nWhy is anyone remotely surprised at the rotten state of our law enforcement? Rage Against the Machine even warned us in 1994 when they sang, \"Some of those who work forces are the same who burn crosses.\" We choose to focus on individual incidents and officers, even as the biggest police union in America, which represents more than 355,000 police officers, recently endorsed Trump in 2020 saying he represents \"law and order.\" This is the same Trump who abused state power to unleash violence on BLM protesters last summer so he could take a photo-op in front of St. John's Church. This is the same Trump who said \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts\" to deter the overwhelmingly peaceful protesters who came out to protest George Floyd's murder but were met with tear gas, rubber bullets, and batons, unleashed by police officer who came dressed for war. It seems David Grossman taught them well.\n\nThe fact so many of us were afraid Chauvin would be found not guilty despite video evidence literally showing him murdering a man in broad daylight, as he confidently stared at Darnella Frazier's cellphone, is a testament to a biased and unfair criminal justice system that often abuses and flaunts its power. This cruelty is encouraged by performative conservative fear merchants in politics and media, like Tucker Carlson, who have replaced dog whistles with literal white surpremacist talking points and conspiracy theories. For Carlson, support for Floyd is now an \"attack on civilization,\" and according to his warped conspiratorial mind Chauvin's conviction was allegedly due to jury intimidation by liberal politicians and media figures. Meanwhile, Carlson defended the violent insurrectionists , using his platform to gaslight America . However, Chauvin's conviction is a bridge too far. He warned if this continues to happen, \"decent, productive people will leave. The country as we know it will be over.\"\n\nAllow me to be the first to say, \"Au revoir and goodbye, racists! Welcome, sane people! Assalamu alaikum to a more decent and productive United States of America.\"\n\nSadly, Carlson's rogues' gallery are here to stay and spew their hate. Many who continue to defend Chauvin are making every excuse for cops to continue kneeling on Black victims. This hateful ecosystem however affords no such generous excuses to Black athletes like Colin Kaepernick who peacefully kneel to protest police brutality. There's still more outrage on the right towards \"cancel culture\" than towards cops who literally cancel the lives of Black and brown people. For example, Brett Favre, the same athlete who recently said politics should be kept out of sports, decided to publicly contribute his astute political analysis on the Chauvin verdict. Favre said although he wasn't defending Chauvin, he nonetheless found it \"hard to believe\" that \"he intentionally meant to kill George Floyd.\"\n\nOf course not. That would require Favre believing that that police could lie and be racist, but he's probably never been pulled over, profiled, surveilled, or stopped and frisked due to his ethnicity or religion.\n\nCommunities of color often don't have such a \"hard\" time believing cops could lie, be corrupt or intentionally violent because our skin color doesn't grant us privilege, but instead often makes us a target. It bears reminding that the district attorney didn't initially charge Chauvin with a crime. The Minneapolis Police Department claimed Floyd \"physically resisted officers.\" They said he allegedly \"died after a medical incident,\" which should win all the awards for the most creative euphemism since \"Operation Enduring Freedom.\" If it wasn't for teenager Darnella Frazier's citizen journalism, capturing the brutal murder on her cellphone, Floyd would be forgotten as another statistic and cruel casualty of a country that doesn't respect Black lives.\n\nDeference to cops and support of their violence has even made Sean Hannity lose his mind more than usual. He referred to Adam Toledo, a child killed by the Chicago police, as \"13-year-old man.\" For reference, Hannity referred to Kyle Rittenhouse as a \"little boy out there trying to protect his community.\" He also compared Black Lives Matter to the KKK, a terrorist organization. The attorney of the police officer who fatally shot and killed Toledo said, \"[Toledo] had a gun in his right hand\" and was beginning to swing the gun in his client's direction. The officer \"was left with no other option\" than to shoot according to the attorney. Recent video of the shooting revealed that Toledo, unlike Rittenhouse, was unarmed. Conservatives care so much about children that accused sexual assaulter, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who doesn't want us to condemn him for his high school yearbook, just ruled that children deserve life in prison without parole . I wonder if he'll feel the same way if Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old, is convicted of murder.\n\n\"We need a new vision for public safety-and new laws, policies and public investments,\" Ifill told me, that will \"upend\" this current system and \"begin to support that vision in meaningful ways.\" One such vision endorsed by President Biden is the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act , which passed in the Democratic-led House. It would ban chokeholds and carotid holds, end \"qualified immunity\" that protects law enforcement from most civil lawsuits, and prohibit discriminatory profiling by law enforcement agencies. Unfortunately, it has no chance of passing in the divided Senate until we abolish the filibuster, another Jim Crow relic historically used to block civil rights progress.\n\nSome activists don't want reform, but want to \"abolish\" the police, which is currently considered an extreme position. However, how can you blame some people for not wanting to overturn a system whose original purpose to them was always meant to terrorize and oppress their communities? Regardless, that position currently doesn't have tangible traction with the majority.\n\nHowever, most people can agree that impoverished communities around America need more investment, more institutions, shelters, and grocery stores, instead of what they currently have which is a whole lot of police, who show up with guns and tasers, introducing armed responses to non-violent crises.\n\n\"I hear from Black communities all over the country that they are happy to refund community services that prevent people from calling the cop in the first place,\" Dr. Goff told me. \"We send police to places where we don't need to send them.\" Dr. Goff said that 96 percent of police calls don't involve violence and 80 percent involve situations that have nothing to do with crime, such as incidents with homelessness and substance abuse.\n\nAlthough many Democrats are utterly terrified of \"Defund the Police \" and how the GOP will weaponize it in the 2022 midterms, it ultimately seems like the right and sane policy. For example, more than 20 major cities have reduced police budgets and are transferring that money to the community, prioritizing public health and public safety. We can argue about the semantics and wording of the slogan, but it's ultimately up to those of us committed to ending injustice and racism to communicate and message the substance behind the policy. After all, marriage equality, Medicare For All and a $15 minimum wage were all considered radical ideas-until they weren't.\n\nOr, we can just continue the status quo and keep talking about \"bad apples.\" If we do, all I ask is we take the simplistic analogy to its logical conclusion. The problem with tolerating a \"few bad apples\" is that eventually they end up contaminating and spoiling the entire barrel.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "How the 'Cop Wives' of TikTok Stand by Their Men\n\nTwo white women lip sync side-by-side on Tik Tok. Nearly everything in the shot is blue: their t-shirts, their coffee tumblers, their eyes, and the color of the text they have written over a TikTok video.\n\nThe a capella opening of the pop song \"Kings & Queens\" by Ava Max plays, promising, \"To all of the queens who are fighting alone, babe you're not dancin' on your own.\" The women raise their mugs, pantomime a toast, give an all-knowing nod to their sisterhood of followers.\n\n#duet with @tanyabuzzetta We stick together!💙 #leowife #leofamily #backtheblue #copsoftiktok #YouGotThis #Yellow #fyp #MicellarRewind\n\nWelcome to #CopWife TikTok, a community on the video sharing app made by and for police spouses. While their husbands are on duty, they fold their laundry. When their men have to pull an all nighter, they sigh, pour a glass of wine, and put the dinner they made in the fridge. They do popular dances alongside their children, using patrol cars as backdrops. They drink out of mugs blazed with a popular catchphrase: \"I do fuck the police . #PoliceWife\" (the \"U\" in \"fuck\" is made up of a gun and a taser, the \"C\" is a pair of handcuffs turned on their sides.)\n\nThis community peddles a familiar stereotype; the ever-patient wife at home, standing by her man despite long hours, lack of sleep, and-oh right-a nationwide call to defund the police and demand accountability from an institution that refuses to reckon with its inherently racist history .\n\nIn June, Rolling Stone 's EJ Dickson wrote about #HumanizeTheBadge , a hashtag created by cops \"still trying to be the good guys\" amid a summer full of protests. My colleague Tarpley Hitt wrote in The Daily Beast about the problems with that corner of TikTok: \"It's always been overt copaganda, a way to distract from the systemic problems in policing with anecdotes of isolated, [positive] incidents.\"\n\nSimilarly, #CopWivesofTikTok (nearly 700,000 views strong) and #LEOWives (that's short for law enforcement officer, just over 400,000 views), serves as homespun PR.\n\n\"Recurring themes [of Cop Wife TikTok] include sisterhood with other LEO wives, fighting online with people who disrespect the police, loneliness, and how hard it is to be married to a law enforcement officer, 'especially in 2020,'\" the journalist Katie Way wrote last month in her newsletter, All Cops Are Posters .\n\nThen there are the #BadgeBunnies (456,000 views)-women who want to date men in uniform. Cop wives and badge bunnies have an antagonistic relationship, one that's often mined for (attempted) humor. Unlike the wannabes, the actual spouses recognize the unglamorous truths of marrying into the profession-and wear these hardships as a badge of honor.\n\n##police ##mrspiggy ##copsoftiktok ##leowife ##copwife\n\nCherie Wiser ( @wholesome.ish.mom ) lives with her detective husband and two young children outside of Indianapolis, Indiana. She's 40 and a stay-at-home mother, although she has a pilot's license and used to teach aviation. Speaking over the phone, while her son could be heard playing in the background with a toy train, Wiser told The Daily Beast she hopes her content speaks to \"both sides of the issue.\"\n\nWhile she has not made a video explicitly saying Black Lives Matter, Wiser said that she supports the movement, at least at home. \"My daughter had BLM drawings all over her room this summer,\" Wiser said. \"I'm always that middle-of-the-road person-how can we all get along?\"\n\nIn June, Wiser saw \"ACAB\" spray painted on a building and had to look it up. (It means, \"all cops are bastards,\" and though the phrase dates back to the 1920s , it was revived this summer in graffiti, protest signs, and hashtags.) She also googled the meaning of \"F12,\" another political slogan of hazy origin that is synonymous with \"fuck the police.\" The comment section on her TikToks are now filled with those phrases.\n\nWiser does not think that supporting the police should be a \"divisive\" issue. But after a summer full of videos depicting police brutality at protests (and cops continuing to shun masks, the most basic of coronavirus protections), of course it is.\n\n\"All Lives Matter is also divisive to me,\" Wiser added. \"I would never say that in any TikTok. I find both ACAB and All Lives Matter to be divisive phrases-let's not say them. Even though I think All Lives Matter people mean well, and ACAB people mean well, too. Blue Lives Matter, I don't love that one either. It triggers people to have a response. I try not to say it.\"\n\nShe likes \"Back the Blue,\" and the other popular pro-police hashtag, \"Got Your Six.\" She also started using a new hashtag, \"Mrs. Piggy,\" which can be cute or a criticism, depending on who you ask.\n\n\"People have been like, 'Yo, I don't like cops, but Miss Piggy-lol,\" Wiser said. \"I think that's a good thing to bridge the huge gap right now.\"\n\nWouldn't change it 🖤💙🖤 ##foyoupage ##foryou ##fyp ##follow ##police ##policewife ##police_officer_wife ##proudpolicewife ##backtheblue\n\nAmanda Taylor ( @mt_manda_taco_burrito ), a 42-year-old dental hygienist from Billings, Montana, has been married to a cop for almost 12 years. It is a life she never imagined she would have growing up in a family of firefighters who had a joking beef with the police.\n\n\"There are these people out there who have this fantasy about men in uniform,\" Taylor said. \"I never wanted anything to do with it. I never wanted to worry about whether or not my husband was going to come home to me. For example, today my husband has been awake for almost 24 hours because he's had to work. I'm a single mom putting my kids to bed without their dad, that's part of it. I never wanted this, but love has a different story for you sometimes.\"\n\nTaylor believes that her TikToks \"expose things that a lot of people don't think about when they think about being a cop wife.\" She speaks about the boredom, the solitude, the cold dinners on the table that go uneaten when her husband has to work overtime.\n\nShe has found camaraderie in the other TikTok cop wives she met online. \"It's really a gathering place where we found each other,\" Taylor said. \"It's such a huge support system, which is important for us. Our husbands are gone a lot, they're emotionally and physically exhausted, so they're not always available. You need to find like-minded people who can understand what you're going through.\"\n\nWouldn't change it 🖤💙🖤 ##foyoupage ##foryou ##fyp ##follow ##police ##policewife ##police_officer_wife ##proudpolicewife ##backtheblue\n\nWiser made a few (\"less than ten\") friends on TikTok who are cops' wives, but her social circle is still predominantly spouses of cops she knows from her husband's work.\n\n\"Law enforcement and military wives, we can be a little over-the-top,\" she said. \"It becomes a whole personality. They wear the T-shirts and when I see that, it's a little cringe-y. That's a stereotype. That's not me.\"\n\nWiser watched the video of Derek Chauvin kneeling on George Floyd's neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds, which spurred global outrage around officer-involved killings.\n\n\"I could only watch it once, and then my husband watched it,\" she said. \"He paused for a while. He was very stone-faced. He doesn't show his emotions really well, that's part of being a cop, but he seemed anxious about it. He said it was really hard to watch, and I asked if he thought it was wrong. He said yes; he was very adamant that this is not the right way to police.\"\n\nThe video did not change how she views law enforcement as an institution; she believes the problem is with the individual officer. While the events of this summer may have encouraged many white Americans to take a closer look at how cops police Black men and women, Wiser has been attuned to these types of incidents for years.\n\n\"With [George Floyd], white people as a whole have gotten better at seeing this,\" she said. \"I've never seen so many people out protesting.\" She remembers the 2016 shooting of Charles Kinsey -a Black mental health therapist aiding his autistic patient in North Miami, Florida-as one of the earliest instances of trigger-happy cops she viewed as unjust. (Kinsey, who was unarmed, survived the attack.)\n\nWiser did not ask her husband, whose social media is private, for permission before posting on #CopWivesofTikTok. Various police departments have allowed officers themselves to maintain a presence on TikTok, with rare exceptions.\n\nEarlier this month, a Coral Springs, Florida, police sergeant named Gilbert Monzon was suspended without pay for two weeks after posting videos on the app where he disparaged Mexican immigrants. (Sgt Monzon's union, the Broward County Police Benevolent Association, stood by the officer and called the investigation a \"witch hunt.\")\n\nAccording to the New York Post , NYPD social media policy \"prohibits officers from posting photographs of themselves in uniform and/or displaying official identification without authorization.\" They also cannot put their job or title in an online handle.\n\nWiser did not ask her husband's permission before making a TikTok; unlike a lot of cops' wives she tends not to film him. \"The only thing I've asked him about was the social media policy at his department,\" she said. \"I absolutely don't speak for him or them.\"\n\nStill, most of the comments on Wiser's videos and the messages she gets focus on her husband. \"That's the most hurtful stuff to me,\" she said. \"When someone says, 'Your husband kills innocent people,' that one's really hard for me not to fight back and respond to. My husband is a really sweet guy. My husband picks up spiders and puts them outside.\"\n\nOne frequent point of trolling cop wives comes when commentators point out a tragic statistic: police officers are two to four times more likely to commit acts of intimate partner violence than the general population .\n\n\"I hate the idea that anyone would weaponize this fact on social media against the wives of police officers,\" Leigh Goodmark, a law professor at the University of Maryland who published a 2015 paper about cops and domestic violence , told The Daily Beast.\n\nGoodmark would not say the abuse is rampant; \"prevalent is a fair word.\" Before publishing her paper, she collected news articles about every instance she could find. \"It's shocking how many there are,\" Goodmark said. \"The thing about it is, for every wife we do know about, there are undoubtedly so many more, because it's hard for a police officer's spouse to do anything public about it.\"\n\nWhy? \"Inherent in the culture of policing in a militarized masculinity,\" Goodmark said. \"That has a significant overlap with the kinds of people who perpetrate violence against their intimate partners. People who go into policing are more likely to have authoritarian personalities, expect deference to authority, and be primed to use violence when that authority is challenged.\"\n\nbest seller on Etsy! ##fyp ##bestseller ##policeofficer ##policewife ##LEO ##mrs ##thinblueline ##glittertumbler ##cophumor ##cop ##copwife ##etsyshop ##smallbiz\n\nMichele Goodwin, a Chancellor's professor at the University of California's Irvine School of Law, noted that these TikTok videos traffic a \"modern day version of the 1950s family,\" with one crucial, only-in-2020 twist.\n\n\"The 1950s version was, 'I'm happy to be at home and take care of my family,'\" Goodwin said. \"This TikTok version is more aggressive, perhaps. These are defiant messages about, 'My man the officer.' They're saying, 'Stay away from my policeman, or I'll take you down.'\"\n\nLike many other TikToks, cop wives often use R&B and hip-hop to soundtrack their videos. A popular trend earlier this spring featured wives filming their husband, in uniform, while the song \"My Type,\" by Saweetie played. \"This phenomena is buttressed by the use of rap songs,\" Goodwin said. \"Yet protests in the streets happen to be about systemic racism in law enforcement and the United States.\"\n\nOne thing the clips do not do, according to Goodwin, is \"allow people to ask critical questions about policing in the United States.\"\n\n\"These videos are meant to convey a message of support and in addition to that, show cops have good, healthy, happy families, are men who treat their wives well, their kids well, and their dogs well,\" she added. \"This counters the images that we see through people's iPhones and cell phones of knees on necks and shootings in the back.\"\n\nThe wives tend to celebrate the individual, rather than interrogate the institution. To be fair, a 15-second clip does not allow for great nuance. But Goodwin wishes there could be \"two messages at the same time\" on #CopWivesofTikTok.\n\nShe wonders, \"What if the wives said, 'I love you and I care for you,' alongside, 'I am so scared and sorry about the society we live in'\"?\n\nMaybe the short videos will evolve in time. Before the election, Wiser went on Joe Biden's campaign website to read about his proposals for criminal justice reform. \"He said something like, ' I'm going to get everybody in the same room ,'\" she recalled. \"I think that is an excellent start. I don't care if it is a Democrat or a Republican who does it, but let's get things going.\"\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "Bizarre Footage Shows Cop Open Fire After Mistaking Acorn for Gunshot\n\nBreaking News Reporter\n\nShocking body-camera footage released this week showed a Florida cop's dangerous overreaction, in which he dropped, rolled, and unloaded an entire clip from his pistol in the direction of a restrained suspect after mistaking an acorn falling on his patrol car for a gunshot.\n\nJesse Hernandez, of the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office in the Florida Panhandle, resigned a month after the incident as his superiors ultimately determined his use of force \"was not objectively reasonable.\"\n\nFootage of the incident, which occurred in November, surfaced for the first time this week. In it, Hernandez is seen flinging himself to the ground while calling out \"shots fired\" four times. He does a roll, breaks his sunglasses, and then pulls out his handgun and opens fire at his own patrol car.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHernandez's partner, Sergeant Beth Roberts, emerges and opens fire herself after confirming with Hernandez that someone shot at him. Making the situation all-the-more baffling, Hernandez, while firing around 18 shots, was grunting and yelled out to his partner, \"I'm hit, oh, I'm hit.\"\n\nMoments later, the footage shows him crawl to cover and he claims that he's been shot through the car. Then, likely realizing he was never shot at all, he tells a frantic Roberts, \"I'm good, I feel weird, but I'm good.\" He later adds, \"It might have hit my vest.\"\n\nIn reality, Hernandez's department determined he was never shot at all, as the detained suspect, 22-year-old Marquis Jackson, a Black man, was not armed. Instead, cops said he sat helpless in the back of the patrol car while a barrage of shots were fired at him by Hernandez and Roberts.\n\nJackson wrote in a lengthy Facebook post that the incident left him \"damaged for life,\" despite miraculously not being struck by the officers' gunfire.\n\nHe said he was \"scared to death,\" and that he leaned over and played dead \"to prevent getting shot in the head.\"\n\n\"Mentally, I'm not OK,\" he said. \"I haven't been the same since and I don't think this feeling I have will ever change.\"\n\nOnce the officers stopped firing, Jackson said they forced him to show his hands, but he couldn't raise them as ordered because he was still in handcuffs on allegations he'd stolen his girlfriend's car. While doing this, he said he was staring down the barrel of an officer's gun, so he closed his eyes and prayed he'd survive the ordeal.\n\n\"I eventually found a way to rest my cuffed hands on the shattered window area to show that I wasn't armed. A few minutes later they swarmed the car and slammed me on the ground to search me,\" he said. \"The image I can't get out of my head is seeing how bad my mom was hurt/crying right before I got into the ambulance.\"\n\nSheriff Eric Aden said in a video statement that he apologized personally to Jackson, his family, and conceded that \"we let the public down.\"\n\n\"I will admit that this was a very tragic and traumatic incident for Mr. Jackson and we are so grateful and thankful that he was not injured,\" Aden said.\n\nThe department compiled a 44-page report for the incident, which included a nearly second-by-second breakdown of the released footage and partial transcripts of interviews that were conducted with the officers involved.\n\nThose interviews appeared to show that Hernandez was in denial of his department's findings. Once informed it was determined the noise that set him off was merely an acorn striking his patrol car's roof, the report said Hernandez refused to watch his own body-camera footage.\n\nRoberts told investigators she only opened fire because Hernandez did so first and she feared he'd been shot. She said his positioning in the middle of the road was particularly troubling-and, in the aftermath, truly puzzling-because police training instructs officers to seek cover in shots-fired situations.\n\nWith Hernandez audibly grunting and calling out that he was hit, plus his strange positioning on the road, Roberts said she truly believed Hernandez had been seriously injured.\n\n\"I thought I just saw a deputy get murdered,\" she said, according to the report. When asked what her feeling was when she heard Hernandez call out that shots were fired, she said she thought, \"Shit has hit the fan.\"\n\nRoberts will not face any internal punishment for her role in the shooting after the probe determined her response was \"objectively reasonable.\"\n\nHernandez was an active deputy in the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office between January 2022 and the incident, which occurred on Nov. 12, 2023. Prior to that, he'd served two tours in Afghanistan but never saw combat.\n\nJackson said that he was placed in a holding cell for hours after the incident and had his fingerprints taken. He said he was eventually released with no charges filed against him. He did not return interview requests from The Daily Beast.\n\nBreaking News Reporter\n\nJosh.Fiallo@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "You turn to us for voices you won't hear anywhere else.\n\nSign up for Democracy Now!'s Daily Digest to get our latest headlines and stories delivered to your inbox every day.\n\nIn Atlanta, a judge has denied bond for 8 of the people indiscriminately arrested at a music festival against the proposed \"Cop City\" police training facility in the Weelaunee Forest. Jailed since March 5, they are charged with domestic terrorism based on scant evidence like muddy clothes or simply being in the area at the time of the festival. We're joined by Micah Herskind, an Atlanta community organizer, who calls the charges \"political prosecutions\" and a blatant \"attempt to repress this social movement that is trying to stop Cop City.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We end today's show with an update on protests against Cop City in Atlanta and a dramatic hearing Thursday, where a judge denied bond for many of the people jailed since March 5th, when they were indiscriminately arrested at a music festival against the proposed police training facility, would be the largest in the country - it's in the Weelaunee Forest - and accused of vandalism and arson at a construction site a mile away. They're charged with domestic terrorism, based on evidence like muddy clothes.\n\nOne of those arrested was longtime New York City activist Priscilla Grim, an editor of The Occupied Wall Street Journal , whose daughter Sophia told The Indypendent , \"We're so grateful and appreciative for all the support we have received. It's made things so much less stressful.\"\n\nFor an update, we're joined by Micah Herskind, a local community organizer in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nWelcome back to Democracy Now! Micah, talk about these charges of domestic terrorism and who is being held in jail and not released on bond?\n\nMICAH HERSKIND : Absolutely. So, at the end of the day, these charges are political prosecution. So, 23 people were arrested at the Weelaunee Forest Festival. This was at the very beginning of the week of action. As you said, there was an action that happened about a mile away from this site, and instead of showing up to that site, police showed up at this music festival, where people were enjoying music, you know, having a good time, and mass arrested people.\n\nNow there are - ever since March 5th, there were 22 people being held in jail without bond. Just yesterday, they had new bond hearings, where about 12 folks got out earlier on consent bonds, which means they didn't have to pay. Eight people were denied bond yesterday, and two people were granted $25,000 bonds.\n\nThe folks who were denied bond were not denied bond for any specific evidence other than, as you said, having mud on their clothes and their shoes, you know, having wet pants. You know, we've seen earlier affidavits and warrants that have said that folks are known members of a prison abolitionist movement. And so, at the end of the day, you know, these are really just about trying to repress this social movement that is trying to stop Cop City.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And this is a social movement that goes across the spectrum in Atlanta right? I mean, you've got religious people. You've got environmentalists who are fighting this. You've got Indigenous people who are fighting this. And you have people who are deeply concerned about issues of police brutality who are fighting this. And then you have the recent police killing of Tortuguita, who was one of the activists, and an independent autopsy just came out that suggested that Tortuguita was sitting cross-legged with their hands in the air when they were shot.\n\nMICAH HERSKIND : Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, so, you know, the state has yet to release its autopsy still, even though we're now months out from this killing. But this independent autopsy showed - you know, Tortuguita's mother, speaking at a press conference, sat down and showed the position that this autopsy found that her child was killed in, which was essentially, you know, looking like this, sitting cross-legged. You know, there were bullets through their palms. And so, yeah, you know, the more information that comes out, the clearer it is that just as these prosecutions are political prosecutions, the killing of Torguguita was a political assassination, where police marched into the force and killed somebody, and then, you know, most likely lied to cover it up.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The Indypendent 's John Tarleton reported that \"The conditions in the DeKalb County Jail women's unit are poor Sophia said\" - one of the daughters of those being held - \"sparse food, overflowing toilets, no personal visits due to short staffing, paid telephone and video call services that barely function and transgender arrestees being assigned to areas that don't correspond to their gender. The men's unit ... reported to be even worse,\" she said.\n\nYour thoughts on how people are able to communicate? And, you know, we just did a story - we interviewed Ben Crump about the 10 people, seven of them police officers, who were arrested on murder charges for killing a mentally challenged man at a hospital in Virginia. They're out on bond. These activists are charged with domestic terrorism and continue to be held.\n\nMICAH HERSKIND : Yes. They're being held, and again, you know, really without evidence. During these bond hearings, it was clear that the prosecution has not yet put together any case. They are using these fallbacks. You know, one of the examples that they gave was that people were wearing black, and that that was evident of playing on the team, of being on the side of the protest. And so, you know, the charges are all really shaky. There's really no legitimate evidence that's been put forward.\n\nIn terms of the jail conditions - right now this is true across the country, but especially in Atlanta - across the metro Atlanta area, our jails are in an absolute crisis. There are jail deaths happening across the metro area, really frequently. The DeKalb County Jail, many parts don't have running water, is what we're hearing from inside. Toilets are broken. There are freezing temperatures.\n\nAnd, you know, despite all of that, there have been vigils that organizers have been hosting outside of the jail as a way to communicate with folks inside. Shortly after their arrests, there was a large vigil that was planned, and things were projected on the jail, and folks were able to yell across the walls of the jail. A father of someone who had been arrested was able to speak directly to his child.

We hear a statement from an Atlanta forest defender about what happened, and speak with Kamau Franklin, an anti-\"Cop City\" activist and the founder of the Atlanta organization Community Movement Builders.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I'm Amy Goodman. This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report .\n\nIn Atlanta, Georgia, calls are growing for an independent investigation into the police killing of an activist Wednesday during a violent raid on an encampment of protesters opposed to the proposed $90 million \"Cop City\" training facility in a public forest. Law enforcement officers, including a SWAT team, were clearing protesters who had occupied a wooded area outside the center, when police claim they were fired on and fired back. Police say a Georgia state trooper was wounded by gunfire. Activists have now released the name of the victim of the police shooting: longtime activist Manuel Terán, who went by the name \"Tortuguita.\"\n\nIn an audio statement sent to Democracy Now! Thursday, an Atlanta forest defender describes what happened and who Tortuguita was. They asked to remain anonymous and for their voice to be distorted for security reasons.\n\nFOREST DEFENDER : On Wednesday, January 18th, multiple police departments descended upon Weelaunee People's Park in unprecedented numbers and force. They blocked access to the park on both roads and bike trails. Some people were arrested for attempting to document police actions that day at the park.\n\nGunfire was heard at 9:04 a.m., about a dozen shots fired in rapid succession, followed by a loud boom about a minute later. For hours after the murder of Tortuguita, police continued to hunt, assault and arrest our brave forest defenders.\n\nThose defenders in trees were targeted with pepper bullets. One tree sitter had their treehouse, which stored food and water, cut from beneath them. They were left without food and water for over 12 hours up in the tree as police waited at the base of the tree to capture them. This same tree sitter continued to stay in their tree until the next morning, when they were arrested.\n\nOther forest defenders were chased by police dogs. These defenders had to hide and flee for their lives, all the while with the nauseating knowing that their dear comrade had been murdered in the sacred land that we call home.\n\nTortuguita was a radiant, joyful, beloved community member. They fought tirelessly to honor and protect the sacred land of the Weelaunee Forest. They took great joy in caring for each and every person that they came across. Tortuguita brought an indescribable jubilance to each and every moment of their life. Their passing is a preventable tragedy. The murder of Tortuguita is a gross violation of both humanity and of this precious Earth, which they loved so fiercely.\n\nDo not turn away from this violence. Do not allow the callousness of the police state to numb your heart. Honor Tortuguita by bravely witnessing the ongoing injustices the police and corporations are enacting upon the Weelaunee Forest. Honor Tortuguita's legacy by embodying their joyous bravery. Tortuguita's presence on this Earth is a gift that will keep on giving for generations to come. It is time for people to join this movement and to say no to this pointless escalation by the police.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That was an anonymous statement by an Atlanta forest defender sent to Democracy Now! , his voice disguised.\n\nVigils for the slain forest defender Tortuguita have taken place from Los Angeles to Minneapolis to Charlotte to Chicago. In Atlanta, activists held a vigil the night of the shooting and are planning a march on Saturday.\n\nFor more, we go to Atlanta to speak with Kamau Franklin, founder of the organization Community Movement Builders.\n\nKamau, welcome back to Democracy Now! Can you please tell us what you understood happened?\n\nKAMAU FRANKLIN : Well, we have very little information on what took place, besides what your earlier recording just said, that the only version of events that's really been released to the public has been the police version, the police narrative, which we should say the corporate media has ran away with. To our knowledge so far, we find it less than likely that the police version of events is what really happened, the idea that he was sitting in a tent and fired out of the tent at basically a SWAT team, DeKalb County police, the Atlanta police and Georgia state troopers, who were there in great numbers to do the raid that they conducted in the park. And the idea is that this person shot, and then they fired back. As the little intel that we have, residents said that they heard a blast of gunshots all at once, and not one blast and then a return of fire. Also, there's been no other information released. We don't know how many times this young person was hit with bullets. We don't know the areas in which this person was hit. We don't know if this is potentially a friendly fire incident. All we know is what the version of the police have given.\n\nAnd that's why we're calling for an independent investigation, not one that's done by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, not one that's done by any federal authority, but a complete independent investigation, because that's the only way we're going to know what really happened. But right now, based on what we do know, we cannot say anything except that this is probably a political assassination. This is something that could have been prevented. There was no reason for them to take the tactics that they did in terms of going into the forest with weapons in hand, with pepper spray, with live ammunition, to go shoot forest defenders who were engaging in civil disobedience and direct action politics.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Kamau Franklin, can we step back and talk about what Cop City - proposed Cop City city is and why people are encamped there?\n\nKAMAU FRANKLIN : Cop City is an idea that came after the 2020 uprisings, by the city of Atlanta, the Atlanta Police Department and the Atlanta Foundation - the Atlanta Police Foundation. The idea, basically, is that they want to develop a militarized police base that's right next to a Black and Brown working-class community. And by building this base, they want to cut down over a hundred acres of forest. They want to develop an area where there is room for explosive testing - explosives testing, over 12 firing ranges, a place where there's a Black Hawk helicopter landing pad, a training center for them to practice crowd control. We should also mention that they are engaged in international training with the Israeli police. And so, we think this project really is the beginning of a militarized police base here in Atlanta, which will be the largest facility of its kind in the country.\n\nAnd the reason for doing this, coming out of the uprisings, we believe, is to stop movement politics and movement building in Atlanta, to coordinate efforts across the country with other police departments, and now internationally, to stop movement building. And we think this is going to be further sort of terroristic action on Black and Brown communities by a police state which is out of control at this particular stage.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Kamau, you had a piece in Truthout, and I wanted to - it was headlined \"MLK's Vision Lives On in Atlanta's Fight Against New Police Training Facility.\" Interestingly, in 2021, the city of Atlanta announced plans, you know, for Cop City, saying it was to carry on the city's civil rights legacy of Martin Luther King and others. Can you talk about this?\n\nKAMAU FRANKLIN : Yeah, I mean, we live in a dystopia, where the legacy of Dr. King is being used by city officials, the same city officials who say that they love \"good trouble,\" they love John Lewis, they love Dr. King. When Dr. King was alive, Dr. King was working against police brutality and police militarization. Dr. King poignantly stated that the police themselves harass and are open to and conduct raids on communities. Obviously, Dr. King was surveilled by the FBI , a local police task force, along with federal police task force. They harassed Dr. King. They sent a letter to Dr. King to kill himself.\n\nAnd so, these tactics, in different ways, continue today. The Cop City task force, which is developed between the FBI , the DeKalb County Police Department, the Atlanta Police Department and several other agencies, Homeland Security, is basically a task force to stomp out movement activity, because they're afraid that the protesters, the various types of protests that are happening, are getting the word out that no one has asked for Cop City. Any survey that's been done has shown that 70% of Atlantans have been against the building of this facility, but yet they went ahead and decided to build it anyway. And now that there's a protest movement against it, they're using all actions, all - everything in their capability and capacity, to stop this movement. And now they've turned to the idea of actually murdering protesters as a way to stop people from going into the forest and to stop the defenders from defending the forest.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Last December, the Atlanta forest defender Tortuguita, who was shot dead by police this week, was featured in an article headlined \"The Forest for the Trees,\" that was written by David Peisner, published on The Bitter Southerner . In the piece, Tortuguita says, quote, \"We get a lot of support from people who live here, and that's important because we win through nonviolence. We're not going to beat them at violence. But we can beat them in public opinion, in the courts even.\" They're also quoted saying, \"This is my home now. We've built a nice community here. It's about reclaiming the parks and public space.\"\n\nThe Atlanta Community Press Collective also wrote, Tortuguita, quote, \"spent their time between Atlanta, defending the forest from destruction and coordinating mutual aid for the movement and, and Florida where they helped build housing in low income communities hit hardest by the hurricane. They were a trained medic, a loving partner, a dear friend, a brave soul, and so much more. In Tort's name, we continue to fight to protect the forest and stop cop city with love, rage, and a commitment to each other's safety and well-being.\"\n\nFinally, Kamau, if you can talk about where this protest stands now? Did the police succeed in completely clearing the encampment, or are people still there?\n\nKAMAU FRANKLIN : To our knowledge, there's still people who have access to the forest who occasionally will go in. We think, obviously, this is a dangerous time, because the police tactics have stepped up to the point where they're actually using live ammunition to shoot and kill protesters.\n\nBut even with that said, we will continue to protest both in the forest, around the forest and in the larger city of Atlanta, and, again, asking for not only national support but international solidarity on this issue, which we've gotten so far, which we expect only to step up more in the coming days and months. This protest movement is not over. It is not defeated. In the memory of the young person who was killed, we will continue to fight.\n\nAnd let's remember also there was over a dozen arrests yesterday. There are more people charged with domestic terrorism.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : With domestic terrorism?\n\nKAMAU FRANKLIN : Yes, more charges of domestic terrorism. The interesting thing is that they charged the people from out of town, people who are not Atlanta residents, with domestic terrorism. Bu they so far have not charged - in this latest round, they have not charged people who were arrested who are from the city with the charge of domestic terrorism. So, we, obviously, think, again, these are scare tactics. These are tactics meant to criminalize the movement against Cop City.\n\nAnd what's really, really important, that we have to keep hammering home, is that this task force, or this idea about what's happening, this criminalization of movement politics, is something that's being done with so-called moderate liberal Democrats in Atlanta, and now a right-wing Republican who is the governor of the state of Georgia, who is now somehow taking the lead in criminalizing and calling protesters names. But this is done together as a collaboration between the Atlanta political establishment and the governor of Georgia. And they are using all of their security forces - again, the Atlanta police, DeKalb County police, state troopers, in conjunction with the FBI and even Homeland Security - to criminalize this movement and now to kill a young activist.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You're talking about Governor Brian Kemp. Kamau Franklin, I want to thank you so much for being with us, the founder of the organization Community Movement Builders. And we'll link to your piece at democracynow.org and continue to follow this encampment and the series of protests.\n\nNext up, we speak with Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors about the death of her 31-year-old cousin Keenan Anderson. He was a 10th grade English teacher, who died after being repeatedly tased by police. Stay with us.\n\n[break]\n\nAMY GOODMAN : \"Déjà Vu,\" performed by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, is written by David Crosby, who has died at the age of 81.

The protesters were taking part in a months-long encampment in a forested area of Atlanta where the city wants to build a $90 million, 85-acre training center on the site of a former prison farm. Conservationists have long wanted to protect the area, the South River Forest,  from future development. Protesters are also urging the city to invest in alternatives to more policing. \"This is basically a boondoggle that's been given to the police to make them feel better,\" says Kamau Franklin, founder of Community Movement Builders, which is a part of a coalition trying to stop the construction of Cop City in Atlanta.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org. I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González, as we end today's show in Atlanta, where five people have been charged with domestic terrorism for taking part in protests against a massive new police training facility known as Cop City. The protesters were taking part in a months-long encampment in a forested area of Atlanta where the city wants to build a $90 million, 85-acre training center on the site of a former prison farm.\n\nConservationists have long fought to protect the area, the South River Forest, from future development. Protesters are also urging Atlanta officials to invest in communities, not more policing. This is Jasmine Burnett of the group Community Movement Builders.\n\nJASMINE BURNETT : People are asking for affordable housing, paving the streets - right? - having sidewalks, better access to MARTA . And instead, they are supporting a project, a $90 million project, to construct the largest urban warfare training facility in this country.\n\nAnd while we understand that this is a very local issue - right? - it's happening right here - we also know that this is a national problem, this is a global problem. The same tactics that they're using against Forest Defenders are the same tactics that the Israeli government is using against Palestinians - right? - the same tactics that the U.S. military is employing in Africa through the AFRICOM program. Right? This is a global struggle against the occupation of our communities.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We go now to Atlanta, Georgia, where we're joined by Kamau Franklin, the founder of Community Movement Builders, part of the coalition trying to stop the construction of Cop City in Atlanta.\n\nKamau, welcome to Democracy Now! We knew you in New York when you were part of the Center for Constitutional Rights. You've moved to Atlanta. Talk about the significance of what's happening now and five activists being charged with - domestic terrorism?\n\nKAMAU FRANKLIN : Yes. Thank you for having me.\n\nAnd as an update, it is now six activists. A day after the initial raid, another raid was done, and another activist was arrested and is now being charged.\n\nSo, we think these charges are setting up, really, the idea of criminalizing dissent around Cop City. So far, these activists have been denied bail. There's a second bail hearing that is coming up. But because of the outrageous charges, the very generalized charge of domestic terrorism under Georgia law, that these folks are still being held.\n\nAnd this has been a concerted effort by law enforcement agencies from the city, the Atlanta Police Department; the county, DeKalb Police Department; the state, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation; at the federal level, the Homeland Security and FBI - have all been involved in a task force which is targeting these organizers and activists on the ground for being opposed to Cop City.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And what are the specific actions that they allegedly have taken to warrant these kinds of charges?\n\nKAMAU FRANKLIN : Well, the interesting thing about these arrests is that these arrests were basically a push in the forest to destroy everything that was built in terms of a resistance movement, a group of folks that we call the Forest Defenders, in terms of the loose coalition of people who have actually moved in the forest or who spend days in the forest camping out as an act of civil disobedience. Remember, Georgia is the place where John Lewis and \"good trouble\" is supposed to be accepted. But civil disobedience in the forest is something that is not accepted when the police want to build a highly militarized training ground.\n\nAnd so, while these folks were just in part of their encampment, they were raided by the police, again, by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. Folks were sitting, literally sitting in tree huts, where they were - all of their camp equipment was destroyed. Rubber bullets were used. Guns were pointing at their head. They were involved at that particular time in no activity whatsoever, except for the act of being in the forest. And they all were taken in and then charged in this sort of RICO or conspiracy idea that the act of protest, the act of civil disobedience, direct action, is something that's now being criminalized, in a statute that really doesn't get used in Georgia, but it's been on the books for a number of years. And so, these folks were doing absolutely nothing but being in the forest as Forest Defenders at the time of their arrest.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And could you tell us a little bit more about Cop City? I mean, how did this idea originate? Who backed it? What politicians were behind it?\n\nKAMAU FRANKLIN : Cop City is something that came out after the George Floyd uprisings of 2020, after George Floyd was killed, Breonna Taylor was killed. Here in Atlanta, Rayshard Brooks was killed by the police. And there were massive protests, as we know, around the country, even around the world, around police violence, police brutality. There were calls for defunding the police. There were calls to abolish the police. There were calls to find new ways to bring safety to various communities, particularly Black and Brown working-class communities.\n\nAnd it was during that time that Keisha Lance Bottoms, then the former mayor of Atlanta, and the City Council, along with the Atlanta Police Foundation, the Atlanta Police Department, the police union, came up with the idea to give basically a gift to the police to make them feel better, as a way of changing the narrative. And as we've seen over the last few years since the George Floyd uprisings, both Democrats and Republicans, elected officials, private companies - the same private companies that claimed that they were supporting Black Lives Matter - have put literally tens of millions of dollars into funding this police apparatus, this Cop City.\n\nAnd so, during that time period of shortly after the uprisings, the idea was came up with that we should - \"we\" being Atlanta - should give this gift to the police of this training center, which, again, is basically - as Jasmine stated in your clip, is an urban warfare center, where there are going to be over a dozen shooting ranges. There's going to be an explosive range. There are going to be mock cities to practice urban warfare. There's going to be a helicopter pad for Black Hawk helicopters to land.\n\nSo, this is being done right in the middle of a working-class and poor Black city - I mean, Black area, in Atlanta, one of the last left intact. And so, this is all planned around changing the narrative, talking about crime and how this facility is going to be used to fight crime, which is, you know, a lie on its face, because this facility, even without protests, would take four to five years to build. So this is basically a boondoggle that's been given to the police to make them feel better, to change the narrative from abolishing or defunding the police to one in which now the police are needed to solve acts of crime.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, can you talk about, Kamau Franklin, the alternatives to militarize police that your group and the whole coalition is calling for? And what's going to happen to these six activists charged with domestic terrorism? We just have a minute.\n\nKAMAU FRANKLIN : Yeah. I mean, our groups have called for alternatives to policing in terms of having outside agencies that are called if there's mental health issues, if there's homeless issues. On a more radical end, we've actually called for our communities having the ability to control any policing that happens, which means the ability to hire or fire policing, to discipline police in our communities. We've called for community copwatches, where we watch the police, safety walks, where we create other avenues of safety which are not around the police.\n\nSo, we are continuing to supporting the organizers and activists who were arrested. We are gathering bail funds as we speak. We're getting lawyers for these folks. Again, another bail hearing is scheduled for the 27th. So, right now we need as much solidarity and support as possible to support these folks and to continue to fight against Cop City being built.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Activist attorney Kamau Franklin is founder of the organization Community Movement Builders, speaking to us from Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nAnd that does it for our show.

Just weeks ago, law enforcement officers - including a SWAT team - were violently evicting protesters who had occupied a wooded area outside the center, when they shot and killed a longtime activist and charged 19 with domestic terrorism. The activists have been camping out in Weelaunee Forest for months to prevent its destruction. Mayor Dickens vowed to address their concerns, but protesters have vowed that Cop City will not be built. We speak with investigative reporter Alleen Brown, who says the \"flimsy\" domestic terrorism charges appear to be part of a strategy to undermine the protest movement rather than respond to an actual threat to public safety. \"These charges may not be meant to stick. Perhaps instead it's meant to send a message,\" she says.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh, as we turn to Atlanta, where Mayor Andre Dickens announced Tuesday the highly contested $90 million police training facility known as \"Cop City\" is moving forward, despite growing opposition and the police killing of a forest defender. Just weeks ago, law enforcement officers - including a SWAT team - were violently evicting protesters who had occupied a wooded area outside the center, when they shot and killed longtime activist Manuel Terán, who went by the name \"Tortuguita.\" Police claim officers were fired on, though activists there dispute the account. The activists have been camping out in Weelaunee Forest for months to prevent its destruction. This is Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens speaking Tuesday.\n\nMAYOR ANDRE DICKENS : Today, I am pleased to report that we have reached an agreement with DeKalb County to issue the construction permits and begin to move the project forward. My administration is aggressively committed to environmental protection. We have been uniquely focused on expanding our protected green spaces in the city. In my first year of office alone, the city of Atlanta and our partners acquired an additional 260 acres throughout the city to be used for parks and green space.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : At the news conference, a reporter asked Police Chief Darin Schierbaum if any protesters were still occupying the proposed Cop City site. This was his response.\n\nPOLICE CHIEF DARIN SCHIERBAUM : Yeah, as of this time, everyone has availed themselves of our request to vacate the area.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Meanwhile, outside City Hall, protesters chanted, \"Cop City will never be built.\" This is community organizer Micah Herskind.\n\nMICAH HERSKIND : How dare they stand in front of people and say, \"Oh, this plan, where we're tearing down trees, is actually good for people, and it's good for the economy, and it's - you know, it's actually going to protect people\"? It's obviously false, and I hope that it's reported as such, because it's such classic, blatant spin, that they're taking us for fools if they think anyone would believe that tearing down trees and putting cement over it is protecting the environment. That's outrageous.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Earlier this week, a coalition of more than 1,300 climate and racial justice groups called for the resignation of Atlanta's Democratic mayor, saying he's failed to denounce the police for shooting dead the activist known as Tortuguita, and instead criticized the protesters. This is Mayor Dickens speaking over the weekend about the protesters.\n\nMAYOR ANDRE DICKENS : And it should be noted that these individuals were not Atlanta or Georgia residents. Most of them traveled into our city to wreak havoc.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, to look more at the city of Atlanta's crackdown on Cop City and what the protesters have been charged with, domestic terrorism, we're joined by Alleen Brown, whose new investigation for Grist is headlined \"Documents show how 19 'Cop City' activists got charged with terrorism: Georgia police are invoking a 2017 terrorism law against activists accused of little more than trespassing.\"\n\nAlleen, welcome back to Democracy Now! You report nine of the forest defenders facing domestic terrorism charges are accused simply of trespassing in the woods by camping and living in a tree house. One person was deemed part of Defend the Atlanta Forest for, quote, \"occupying a tree house while wearing a gas mask and camouflage clothing.\" Can you just please explain?\n\nALLEEN BROWN : Yeah. So, thank you so much for having me.\n\nI reviewed 20 arrest warrants for 19 people charged with domestic terrorism in Atlanta and found that none of those individuals are alleged to have committed any act that seriously injured anyone. Like you mentioned, nine of the warrants describe no specific illegal acts beyond misdemeanor trespassing - essentially, camping in a forest. Instead, for those charged in the forest, their domestic terrorism allegations seem to rest on the idea that the Department of Homeland Security designated people associated with the slogan \"Defend the Atlanta Forest\" to be domestic violent extremists. You know, I asked DHS about this, and they told me that they don't classify any groups that way, although they do communicate with local and state officials about threats.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Could you explain, Alleen, the origins of Georgia's terror law and how it is that these people were charged?\n\nALLEEN BROWN : Yeah. So, Georgia's domestic terrorism law passed in 2017, and it was really drafted as a means to confront these mass shootings that we see month in and month out. Specifically, lawmakers named the 2015 massacre of nine Black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, who were shot and killed by white supremacist Dylann Roof. So, you know, essentially, this law was created to address violence by white supremacists.\n\nYou know, at the time, civil liberties groups really put out that this was going to be used instead against people expressing their First Amendment rights and marginalized communities. So, it appears a version of that is what has come to pass. And this really serves as a warning signal to people on both sides of the party, lawmakers that have continued to suggest new domestic terrorism legislation is necessary to confront mass shootings.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Roy Wood Jr. of The Daily Show on Comedy Central recently went to the Atlanta forest to cover the movement to stop Cop City. We want to go to a clip.\n\nROY WOOD JR.: Wait, bingo. Y'all got bingo night?\n\nFOREST DEFENDER 1: Yeah.\n\nROY WOOD JR.: Where is the Molotov cocktail station? Where's the gun training station?\n\nFOREST DEFENDER 2: The majority of us just want to live in peace with each other.\n\nFOREST DEFENDER 1: We work here on ourselves, and we do yoga, and we meditate, get massages here.\n\nROY WOOD JR.: Y'all get massages? You do yoga, meditate, stretch and deal with your inner - like therapy.\n\nFOREST DEFENDER 1: Yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That's Roy Wood Jr. of The Daily Show on Comedy Central. If only what was happening there was so funny. Alleen Brown, if you could take it from there? And also, if they face domestic terrorism charges, how many years in prison do they face? And does this make it easier, if the protesters are considered domestic terrorists, for SWAT teams to move in and, well, in the case of Tortuguita, to kill them?\n\nALLEEN BROWN : So, these charges carry mandatory minimums of five to 35 years, so they're very serious charges. And, you know, they really - a lot of people are - attorneys are saying that they're legally quite flimsy. You know, the law says that you have to commit a felony in order to be charged with domestic terrorism in Georgia. As we've talked about, a lot of these people are charged with misdemeanor trespassing.\n\nBut, you know, the idea is that this may not be meant - these charges may not be meant to stick. Perhaps instead it's meant to send a message that this is a criminal group, these are terrorists, and, you know, maybe someone with more moderate views doesn't want to be affiliated with such a group. So, in that sense, it creates a sort of public relations message that perhaps does make it easier to go in and evict people and escalate to something like what we saw on January 18th with Tortuguita.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We just have a minute, Alleen, but if you can respond to the mayor's latest announcement they're moving forward with Cop City, and the feeling in Atlanta around what this is, and if you could explain what it is?\n\nALLEEN BROWN : Yeah, sure. I mean, you know, what I found is that this is really a wide-ranging movement. There are, of course, forest defenders occupying this forest, defending the trees. There are also parks advocates, people concerned about police brutality, gentrification, neighborhood associations that have stood out against this project. So, I think Atlanta officials, as long as they continue to push this, are going to continue to face a really kind of strong, wide-ranging movement.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Alleen Brown, we want to thank you for being with us. We're going to link to your piece , investigative reporter who covers environmental justice and the ways the climate crisis impacts criminalized populations. The new piece in Grist is headlined \"Documents show how 19 'Cop City' activists got charged with terrorism.\"\n\nComing up, he's nominated for an Oscar for his film, the documentary All That Breathes . We'll speak with director Shaunak Sen about the film he made about two brothers in New Delhi who run a bird hospital in their basement next to a metal shop. Stay with us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

      "text": "A 'Cop of peace'? How can authoritarian, human rights-trashing Azerbaijan possibly host that?\n\nThe 'theme' chosen for Cop29 must be some kind of dark joke. This summit, like those before it, is a mere act of greenwashing\n\nD uring rapidly escalating climate and humanitarian crises, another authoritarian petrostate with no respect for human rights is hosting Cop29 - the UN's latest annual climate summit that starts today and is being held after the re-election of a climate-denier US president .\n\nCop meetings have proven to be greenwashing conferences that legitimise countries' failures to ensure a livable world and future and have also allowed authoritarian regimes like Azerbaijan and the two previous hosts - the United Arab Emirates and Egypt - to continue violating human rights.\n\nGenocides, ecocides, famines, wars, colonialism, rising inequalities and an escalating climate collapse are all interconnected crises that reinforce each other and lead to unimaginable suffering. While humanitarian crises are unfolding in Palestine, Yemen, Afghanistan, Sudan, Congo, Kurdistan, Lebanon, Balochistan, Ukraine, Nagorno-Karabakh/Artsakh, and many, many other places, humanity is also breaching the 1.5C greenhouse gas emissions limit, with no signs of real reductions in sight. Instead, the opposite is taking place - last year, global emissions reached an all-time high. Heat records have been shattered , and this year is \" virtually certain \" to be the hottest year ever recorded, with unprecedented extreme weather events pushing the planet further into uncharted territory. The destabilisation of the biosphere and the natural ecosystems we depend on to survive is leading to untold human suffering and further accelerating the mass extinction of flora and fauna.\n\nAzerbaijan's entire economy is built on fossil fuels, with the state-owned oil company Socar's oil and gas exports accounting for close to 90% of the country's exports . Despite what it might claim , Azerbaijan has no ambition to take climate action. It is planning to expand fossil fuel production, which is completely incompatible with the 1.5C limit and the goals of the Paris agreement on climate change.\n\nMany attenders of this year's Cop are scared to criticise the Azerbaijan government. Human Rights Watch recently published a statement explaining how it couldn't be certain that attenders' rights to peacefully protest would be guaranteed. In addition, Azerbaijan land and sea borders will remain closed during Cop29, making it only possible to travel in and out of the country by air, which causes pollution and which many Azerbaijan citizens can't afford. The reason given for closing borders at all Cops since the start of the Covid pandemic is to maintain \"national security\", but I've heard many Azerbaijanis describe the situation as being \"kept in a prison\".\n\nThe Azerbaijan regime is guilty of ethnic cleansing , humanitarian blockades and war crimes , as well as repressing its own population and cracking down on the country's civil society. The independent watchdog Freedom House ranks the country as the least democratic state in Europe, with the regime actively targeting journalists, independent media outlets, political and civic activists, and human rights defenders. Azerbaijan also accounts for about 40% of Israel's annual oil imports , thus fuelling the Israeli war machine and being complicit in the genocide in Palestine and Israel's war crimes in Lebanon. The Azerbaijan-Israel ties are mutually beneficial as the majority of weapons used by Azerbaijan during the second Nagorno-Karabakh war and likely those used in the September 2023 military operation into the Karabakh region were imported from Israel.\n\nThe \" Cop of peace \" is one theme chosen for this year's climate conference by the host, which wants to encourage states to observe a \"Cop truce\". It is gut-wrenching, to say the least, to talk of global peace after the terrible human rights violations committed by Azerbaijan's Aliyev regime against ethnic Armenians living in the Nagorno-Karabakh/Artsakh region. Furthermore, Azerbaijan is planning to greenwash its crimes against Armenians by building a \" Green Energy Zone \" on territories where the population has been ethnically cleansed.\n\nHow did this country get to host the climate summit? It was eastern Europe's turn. But Russia vetoed EU member states, so the options were either Armenia or Azerbaijan. Armenia lifted its veto against Azerbaijan and supported its bid in exchange for a release of prisoners , although a large number of Armenian political prisoners are still being held. Last year, the regime critic Gubad Ibadoghlu was imprisoned after criticising Azerbaijan's fossil fuel industry. Other political prisoners include peace activist Bahruz Samadov, ethnic minority researcher Iqbal Abilov, political activists Akif Gurbanov and Ruslan Izzatli and journalists .\n\nMeanwhile, the EU continues to buy fossil fuels from Azerbaijan and plans to double its import of fossil gas from the country by 2027.\n\nThe climate crisis is just as much about protecting human rights as it is about protecting the climate and biodiversity. You cannot claim to care about climate justice if you ignore the sufferings of oppressed and colonised people today. We cannot pick and choose whose human rights to care for, and who to leave behind. Climate justice means justice, safety and freedom for everyone.\n\nDuring Cop29 , the picture of Azerbaijan reported by the media will be a whitewashed and greenwashed version that the regime is desperate to portray. But make no mistake - it is a repressive state accused of ethnic cleansing.\n\nWe need immediate sanctions targeted against the regime and a halt to the import of Azerbaijani fossil fuels. Diplomatic pressure must also be put on the regime to release its Armenian hostages and all political prisoners - and ensure the right to a safe return for Armenians.\n\nGreta Thunberg is a Swedish activist and international climate crisis campaigner"

      "text": "Cop16 nature summit agrees deal at 11th hour but critics say it is not enough\n\nUN biodiversity conference in Rome ends with fragile accord but questions remain over whether funding will emerge\n\nThe task of halting nature loss by 2030 is slipping out of reach, ministers have warned, as countries from around the world came to a hard-won compromise on nature finance after marathon negotiations in Rome.\n\nDelegates at the UN biodiversity conference - known as Cop16 - broke into applause after finally reaching a deal in the Eternal City following a night of tense and painstaking discussions. Cop16 president Susana Muhamad wept as she brought down the gavel on the agreement outlining a roadmap for nature finance. The agreement broke a deadlock at UN talks seen as a test for international cooperation in the face of geopolitical tensions .\n\nDespite some wins, difficult questions were kicked down the road, including the creation of a new fund to distribute money, and significant issues including nature-destroying subsidies and cutting pollution have not progressed.\n\nScientists have long warned that action is urgent. A million of the world's species are threatened with extinction, while unsustainable farming and consumption destroy forests, deplete soils and spread plastic pollution to even the most remote areas of the planet.\n\nKey decisions were adopted in the final minutes of the last day of rebooted negotiations at the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization headquarters in Rome.\n\nMuhamad called it a \"historic day\", and added: \"We achieved the adoption of the first global plan to finance the conservation of life on Earth.\"\n\nA number of leaders called the agreement a victory for cooperation. \"Our efforts show that multilateralism can present hope at a time of geopolitical uncertainty,\" said Steven Guilbeault, Canada's minister of environment and climate change.\n\nJean-Luc Crucke, Belgium's climate and ecological transition minister, agreed. \"Today we are in a world that is politically changing,\" he said. \"And not always in the right direction.\"\n\nHe said that getting the agreement over the line proved that multilateralism was still working, and added: \"So there is a great significance to these negotiations.\"\n\nCrucke described the Cop negotiations as the \"least bad\" process. If we really want to save nature, he said, \"there is no other solution than this one\".\n\nEvery two years, representatives from around the world meet to discuss UN targets to halt nature loss by 2030. The gathering is formally known as the conference of the parties of the UN convention on biological diversity - shortened in this case to Cop16, as it is the 16th meeting.\n\nThe last gathering was in Cali, Colombia, last November, but the meeting ended in chaos with key issues left unresolved. From 25 to 27 February in Rome, parties will gather for an additional meeting to finish those negotiations, and tackle the most divisive issue: money.\n\nThe main topics being discussed include who will pay for conservation and how to distribute the money. Delegates are also set to agree on a monitoring framework, so countries can be held to account on their progress on meeting the biodiversity targets for this decade.\n\nThe decision comes more than two years after a landmark deal to slow the rampant destruction of nature this decade and protect at least 30% of the world's land and seas. That would protect ecosystems and wildlife that humans rely on for food, climate regulation and economic prosperity.\n\nThe meeting comes as countries face a range of challenges, from trade disputes and debt worries to the slashing of overseas aid - particularly by the Trump administration.\n\nWashington, which has not signed up to the UN's convention on biological diversity, did not send representatives to the meeting.\n\nBut others at the summit expressed frustration at the agreement's lack of ambition when it comes to the environmental crisis. The negotiator from Bolivia, Juan Carlos Alurralde Tejada, raised concerns about the text \"diluting\" commitments to biodiversity and opening the path to an \"indefinite discussion\" on who will pay for conservation and how to distribute the money.\n\n\"Biodiversity cannot wait for a bureaucratic process that lasts for ever, while the environmental crisis continues to get worse,\" Alurralde said. \"Forests are burning, rivers are in agony and animals are disappearing.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the overarching ambition to halt nature loss by 2030 is looking more difficult to reach, with global wildlife populations having plunged by more than 70% between 1970 and 2020, according to the most recent assessment, with no sign of slowing.\n\n\"Honestly, it's almost impossible when you see the trends of where things are going,\" said Max Fontaine, environment and development minister in Madagascar, one of the most biodiverse countries. \"We are not going in the right direction, we all need to strengthen efforts.\"\n\nFive years to implement the biodiversity targets was not enough, said the Liberian negotiator, Datuama Cammue, who believed the UN process had been too slow. \"It will take a lot of financial input and expert input to get it done. With this type of spirit, I really don't think that it's possible.\"\n\nThe failure to finalise an agreement in Cali was the first in a string of disappointing outcomes at environmental summits last year.\n\nA climate finance deal at Cop29 in Azerbaijan in November was criticised by developing countries as woefully insufficient, while separate negotiations about desertification and plastic pollution stalled in December.\n\nCountries had already agreed to deliver $200bn (£159bn) a year in finance for nature by 2030, including $30bn a year from wealthier countries to poorer ones.\n\nAs of 2022 (the latest year for which data is available and before the Cop15 deal was signed), wealthy countries that signed the agreement had provided $10.95bn in biodiversity funding, according to the report by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) and Campaign for Nature.\n\nAndreas Bjelland Eriksen, Norway's climate and environment minister, said countries had a \"big, big job ahead\" to meet the 2030 finance goal. \"We have to do everything we can to meet those targets,\" he said, adding that it was important to be ambitious in climate and biodiversity targets. He said: \"Ambitious is not the same as impossible.\"\n\nThursday's decision sets out two main strands of action in the coming years - finding the extra billions of dollars in funding for biodiversity; and deciding on the institutions that will deliver the money.\n\nGeorgina Chandler, head of policy and campaigns at the Zoological Society of London, said the finance roadmap was a \"key milestone\" but stressed that money is needed urgently.\n\n\"With only five years left to halt and reverse biodiversity loss, securing the necessary funds to accomplish this mission is more essential than ever,\" she said.\n\n' Agreeing to agree' on a new fund\n\nMany developing countries demanded a new bank account to distribute nature finance. They argue that the current fund - which sits within the Global Environment Facility (GEF) - is too burdensome to access and is controlled by wealthy nations. This was the subject of the most tense negotiations.\n\n\"Agreeing to agree is maybe not sexy,\" said Bernadette Fischler Hooper, global advocacy lead at WWF, \"but it is a big achievement.\" She added: \"We're going to live to fight another day. That is exactly what that is about.\"\n\nCountries will agree what to do on the new fund in 2028. In the meantime, all options are on the table - it could be a new fund, or an existing fund that has been made more palatable.\n\nRoadmap for producing cash\n\nThe headline figure agreed on by countries at Cop15 in 2022 was to generate $200bn a year in nature finance . Developed nations committed to delivering $20bn in international biodiversity finance by 2025 - a deadline that has not yet been met. Negotiators agreed a roadmap to raising the money, which includes looking for new forms of finance as well as a push for development banks to increase spending on biodiversity.\n\nFor the first time there will be an \"international dialogue\" between ministers of finance and environment (as happens within the UN climate framework) which will make sure that finance for biodiversity is not siloed within environmental ministries. Brian O'Donnell, director of Campaign for Nature, described it as a \"highlight of this deal\".\n\nMonitoring progress\n\nCop17 in 2026 will be about measuring how countries are doing relative to their targets. In Rome they signed off what indicators they will use to submit their national reports. \"The monitoring framework will allow us to do the accountability process at the next Cop,\" said Chandler.\n\nLaunch of Cali fund\n\nThe Cali fund is a way to distribute money from companies who benefit from nature's genetics. The fund was launched with nothing pledged, but the UN said commitments were coming \"very soon\". According to the agreement, companies that met two of three criteria - sales of more than $50m (£39m), profits of more than $5m, and $20m in total assets - would need to contribute 1% of profits or 0.1% of their revenue to the fund.\n\nThe deal is voluntary and governments will need to introduce the rules domestically for it to have teeth.\n\nAgence France-Presse contributed to this report"

      "text": "Atlanta Police Foundation ignored Cop City records requests, lawsuit claims\n\nUniversity of Georgia filed complaint on behalf of news outlet and transparency research organization, saying queries unanswered\n\nA law clinic at the University of Georgia has sued the Atlanta Police Foundation, after the non-profit organization repeatedly ignored records requests from journalists and researchers about its role in backing the controversial police-training center opponents have dubbed Cop City.\n\nThe complaint, filed on behalf of the digital news outlet Atlanta Community Press Collective and the Chicago-based digital transparency research organization Lucy Parsons Labs , details how numerous queries to the foundation under Georgia's Open Records Act have not been answered.\n\nIt is \"the first lawsuit to my knowledge taking on a police foundation\" over access to information about what they do, according to Robert Vargas , a University of Chicago sociology professor who researches police foundations.\n\nThe Atlanta Police Foundation, or APF, is building the $109m training center on a 171-acre footprint in a forest south-east of the city; at least $67m of the project's cost comes from taxpayer funds.\n\nThe lawsuit \"alleges that by virtue of [the foundation] performing a service or function for or on behalf of the City of Atlanta\", all records related to the project should be publicly available, according to a press release from Samantha C Hamilton, an attorney at the university law school's first amendment clinic.\n\nThe APF has followed a nationwide trend of police foundations receiving increasing donations over the last decade, since the inception of the Black Lives Matter movement, Vargas noted. Their role has increasingly been \"to help launder the reputation of the police ... [and] operate outside of open records laws\".\n\nThe lawsuit's claims highlight how \"over the last decade, the failure of police foundations nationwide to provide basic levels of transparency raises questions about their motives, and whether or not they have the public interest at heart\", said Alex Vitale, the author of The End of Policing . \"If you have nothing to hide, then why are you hiding?\" Vitale said.\n\nThe fight against Cop City has drawn national and global headlines, particularly since 18 January of last year, when state troopers shot and killed Manuel Paez Terán , known as \"Tortuguita\", who was camping in protest at a public park near the Cop City site - the first such incident in US history. Opposition to the project has come from a wide range of local and national supporters, with concerns such as unchecked police militarization and clearing forests in an era of climate crisis. Atlanta police say the center is needed for \"world-class\" training.\n\nLast week's lawsuit draws attention to the center's driving force, the APF - one of the nation's largest police foundations, and one of the most well-funded among hundreds, with support from corporate donors such as Delta, Wells Fargo and Home Depot. Its CEO, Dave Wilkinson, is also the highest-paid among police foundation CEOs nationwide, with a 2022 salary of $500,000.\n\nCorporate funding, coupled with their non-profit status, have allowed police foundations to escape public scrutiny, said Vitale. \"Police have relied on these slush funds to provide them with levels of independence from government oversight unheard of in any other agency,\" Vitale said.\n\nThe complaint joins at least four others linked to Cop City filed by journalists and documentarians in more than a year, for actions ranging from Atlanta police deleting a documentarian's footage to the Georgia bureau of investigation refusing to release its investigative file on Paez Terán's death, claiming that it forms part of an ongoing criminal investigation into dozens of people opposed to the project.\n\nThe Atlanta Community Press Collective, or ACPC, began reporting on the training center in late 2021, filling a vacuum left in local media exemplified by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution failing to disclose in much of its news and opinion coverage of the project that Alex Taylor, the CEO of Cox Enterprises - the paper's owner - had led a multimillion-dollar fundraising drive for the foundation.\n\nACPC's early reporting gleaned details from minutes of the APF's quarterly board meetings, which the scrappy startup obtained from open records requests to Atlanta police, who were receiving the minutes by email. By the end of 2022, \"we noticed they stopped sending the minutes that way, along with other emails\", said Matt Scott, an ACPC reporter.\n\nIn spring 2023, the outlet started making records requests directly to the APF for board meeting minutes - and a \"line-item construction budget\". They received no reply. Scott said that foundation representatives also had not appeared in Atlanta city council meetings with updates on the project for more than a year.\n\nAround the same time last year, Ed Vogel, a researcher at Lucy Parsons Labs, also began submitting records requests to the foundation - including for contracts, \"environmental testing and assessments\", communications about a grassroots initiative to let voters decide via a referendum whether the center should be built and communications between Wilkinson and the Georgia attorney general, Chris Carr, who by September had issued an unprecedented indictment of 61 people for alleged conspiracy, or Rico. Vogel also received no reply.\n\nAn APF spokesperson, Rob Baskin, did not return requests for comment.\n\nVogel said he was as interested in financial records as in understanding how \"key individuals [such as Wilkinson] understand their relationships\" to government figures such as Carr. \"For me, it's important to see how individuals with significant roles are talking about their roles, and how they are talking to each other,\" Vogel said.\n\nNot having access to records and not understanding these relationships means not understanding how certain key decisions in any community get made, said Vitale. \"By obscuring the role of police foundations, we allow very powerful actors to shape public policy around public safety with absolutely no accountability,\" he said.\n\nVogel hopes the suit leads to more than producing documents. \"Transparency is important - creating public access regarding what's happening in and around this facility,\" he said.\n\n\"But transparency isn't democracy ... What this should lead to is better democratic processes - a greater role of the public in deciding how infrastructure gets built. It shouldn't be something handled behind closed doors.\""

      "text": "Atlanta police condemned for heavy-handed action at Cop City protest\n\nOfficers used flash-bang grenades, teargas canisters, tanks and snipers and accused participants of 'terrorism'\n\nPolice actions during a mass protest called \"Block Cop City\" that drew people from across the US to Atlanta this week have been condemned as heavy-handed after they included flash-bang grenades, teargas canisters, tanks and a press conference full of demonstrably false or misleading descriptions of the event.\n\nThe Guardian also spoke with a protester who was detained, repeatedly called a \"terrorist\", handcuffed and threatened with arrest in a supermarket parking lot near the march - only to be released with no charges.\n\nThe actions are the latest hardline display against opposition to Cop City, a sign that Atlanta authorities are determined to combat dissent on the project.\n\nThe Block Cop City action did not achieve its stated goal of occupying the site of the controversial, $90m police and fire department center known as \"Cop City\", but did shut down work for a day at the 171-acre construction footprint in a forest south-east of Atlanta.\n\nThe event drew nearly 500 people from dozens of cities and included non-violent direct action training and planning and a commitment to no property damage or weapons. Nonetheless, multiple jurisdictions deployed police to the project's construction site and streets in the surrounding area and Atlanta's police chief, Darin Schierbaum, characterized the event as a threat to public safety, citing evidence such as gas masks.\n\n\"It's absurdly hypocritical of the police,\" said Jamie Peck, an organizer who came from New York. \"They're claiming we were the violent ones, when non-violence was in the DNA of the action from the beginning. Trying to say we're violent when we brought protective gear is sort of Orwellian.\"\n\nThe march began early on Monday morning at a park several miles from the Cop City site and included between 350 and 400 marchers as well as carnival-sized puppets and a marching band. Dozens wore spray-painted, white jumpsuits - in homage, organizers said, to European environmental activists.\n\nJoel Paez and Belkis Terán warmed up the crowd - parents of Manuel Paez Terán , or \"Tortuguita\", who police shot and killed on 18 January , while the activist was camping in a forested public park about a mile from the construction site. Paez told the crowd he saw them all as \"family\". \"I pray for the safety of everyone here,\" he said. \"I pray for the generations fighting for a better world.\"\n\nThe march then wound its way through the park and toward another park that abuts the Cop City site. Police blocked a tunnel connecting the two parks, so marchers turned into a nearby neighborhood and, eventually, on to a four-lane road leading to the site's entrance.\n\nSoon after, marchers were met by a line of DeKalb county police. They had shields, teargas guns, a dog and a tank called \"The Beast\"; there were officers with automatic weapons whose uniforms read \"sniper\". As soon as the first line of marchers made contact with police, several officers aimed gas canisters and flash-bang grenades at the crowd. They also fired at a group of clearly identified members of the press who were on the shoulder of the road.\n\nAbout a dozen journalists were separated from the march. When one tried to return, an officer blocked him on the public road and said, \"this is an active crime scene\". Another officer later let him return to doing his job.\n\nOne protester who had come from Arizona to participate in the action had gone to a nearby supermarket with another protester. The activist, who uses they/them pronouns, didn't want the Guardian using their name.\n\nThe activists were sitting together in a car watching a live feed of the march when police approached. \"What are you doing here? Commanding the action from your car?\" asked one officer. Police repeatedly accused the activist about \"inciting crimes\", of being a \"terrorist\". Officers asked, \"Why do you come to our town to mess things up?\" One said: \"You don't even know what this project is about - there's crime in this town, and you need us.\"\n\nThe officers also separated the two; the Arizonan later discovered their fellow protester had been arrested after supplying a false name and released on misdemeanor charges.\n\nMeanwhile, officers eventually told the 39-year-old human resources professional they were free to go - until a plainclothes officer came behind them and said they were being arrested for \"conspiracy to commit acts of terrorism\". Another officer then asked them if they possessed incendiary devices. They were eventually released.\n\nThe language of terrorism echoes the state of Georgia's recent indictment and arraignment of 61 people in connection with Cop City under the state's Rico, or racketeering law, accusing them of forming a conspiracy.\n\nAt a later press conference Schierbaum, the police chief, told the public that police had kept the city safe from dangerous people who were \"prepared to do harm, prepared to do destruction\".\n\nHe displayed evidence of his claims such as tools used to plant trees by a roadside, gas masks and bolt cutters - presumably intended to cut through the fence surrounding the construction site. Ample video evidence exists of the peaceful roadside tree planting and it was police who used teargas.\n\nAtlanta police did not respond to the Guardian's request for comment.\n\nThe Arizonan activist decided to get away for awhile, and drove to the (Martin Luther) King Center in Atlanta. \"I just cried for awhile. I thought, 'This isn't your legacy. This isn't what you dreamed of.'\""

      "text": "Atlanta police surveil people opposing 'Cop City': 'There's this constant stalking feeling'\n\nResidents wonder what legal protections are available as police monitor them at all hours, blaring sirens and shining lights\n\nAtlanta police have been carrying out around-the-clock surveillance in several neighborhoods for months, on people and houses linked to opposition against the police training center colloquially known as \"Cop City\".\n\nThe surveillance in Georgia has included following people in cars, blasting sirens outside bedroom windows and shining headlights into houses at night, the Guardian has learned.\n\nWhile no arrests have been made, residents said they're at a loss as to what legal protections of privacy and freedom from harassment are available to them. Chata Spikes, the Atlanta police spokesperson, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe ongoing actions started soon after an 8 February pre-dawn, Swat-style raid on three Atlanta houses in which Atlanta police and agents from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives sought evidence relating to arson of construction and police equipment.\n\nPolice have since established themselves in four neighborhoods, centering on about 12 houses - including those that were previously raided - with marked and unmarked cars parking near them, driving slowly by and leaving when approached by residents.\n\nSocial movement historian Dan Berger said this low-tech type of surveillance and related behavior - blasting sirens and flashing lights, following people - has precedence dating at least to the civil rights era. He called the actions \"naked intimidation with plausible deniability attached to it\".\n\nBerger added that \"[a] common strategy of police work is, when a movement reaches a point of threat, the powers that be begin actively trying to scare them out of existence - showing them they know where they live, who they hang out with\".\n\nThe Cop City training center is being built on a 171-acre footprint in a forest south-east of Atlanta. Opposition has come from a wide range of local and national supporters and is centered on concerns such as unchecked police militarization and clearing forests in an era of climate crisis. Atlanta police say the center is needed for \"world-class\" training.\n\nOne resident of a Lakewood neighborhood house raided on 8 February described being in a car with another person several days afterward. Different vehicles followed them for four and a half hours, as they drove out of city limits and into Gwinnett county suburbs.\n\nWhen they stopped in a drive-through, a Gwinnett police officer pulled them over and gave them a ticket for having the car's license plate in the back window, and not on the bumper.\n\nThe Guardian spoke to the driver in that incident, as well as half a dozen other residents of different Atlanta neighborhoods and a DeKalb county neighborhood experiencing increased Atlanta police presence in recent months. All of them spoke on the condition of anonymity or used assumed names, out of safety concerns.\n\nThe same Lakewood resident who was a passenger in the followed car was stirred from bed one morning in March at 3:30am, when a police car blasted its siren for about 10 seconds.\n\n\"I'm not a lawyer,\" he said. \"But it eventually reaches the point of harassment - how do you tell cops they've crossed that threshold?\"\n\nAndrew Ferguson , a lawyer, law professor at the American University Washington College of Law and expert on police surveillance, privacy and civil rights, explained how this behavior can happen.\n\n\"Generally speaking, courts have given police the power to investigate crimes,\" he said. \"[T]he problem is, abuse and harassment are usually harder to define ... and there aren't great external laws to say, 'You can't do this.'\"\n\nAtlanta police have been carrying out \"physical surveillance\" - as distinguished from digital or technological surveillance, Ferguson noted. The reason: \"Police want to be seen because the purpose of the surveillance is to intimidate and expose dissenting voices. Police are using the coercive power of surveillance to silence protest and dissent.\"\n\nSign up to This Week in Trumpland\n\nA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nFerguson noted that the US constitution's fourth amendment \"is supposed to be a check on this\", adding that what's happening in Atlanta is \"exactly the kind of case where there needs to be some kind of external examination - like from the Department of Justice\".\n\nMeanwhile, some residents keep tallies of police activity outside their houses. In Lakewood, 10 houses exchange observations on a Signal thread. Ashley, a south Atlanta resident, made 16 entries on a list.\n\n\"One night, people were over for dinner and a cop car slowed down in front of the house, about 20ft from the entrance. The room got quiet,\" she said. \"It's like an intimidation tactic.

He ran into the house, filled a bucket with water and doused the flames. It is unclear who left the flare on the porch.\n\n\"I'm already paranoid,\" he said. \"But there's a difference between police surveillance and trying to burn your house down.\" A lawyer recommended filing a police report. \"But what if it's a state actor?

      "text": "Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F review - Eddie Murphy's megawatt charisma lights up creaking sequel\n\nReprising his role as lovable undercover cop Axel Foley, the actor - and some full-on car-chase carnage - can't disguise a plot several decades past its sell-by date in debut director Mark Molloy's slickly packaged action comedy\n\nI t's a full 40 years since maverick Detroit police detective Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy) first found himself a fish out of water in the alien world of Beverly Hills, and 30 years since the franchise's most recent instalment. As Foley revisits the west coast yet again for the fourth film, what's remarkable is how little has changed. Sure, there are a few more wrinkles on the returning cast members (Murphy, who is comparatively well preserved, clearly relishes a running gag about how ancient and creaky his co-stars now look), but the plot could have been cut and pasted from parts of any one of the previous outings.\n\nFoley creates havoc in a Detroit-based opening action sequence, decamps to the fanciest upmarket neighbourhood in Los Angeles (in this case, a threat to the safety of his adult daughter is the motivation), causes more havoc, falls foul of his bosses and finally saves the day, thus vindicating his unorthodox techniques and issues with authority figures. It's not unentertaining - the blast force of Murphy's charisma alone carries the picture, and that's before you get to the bracing vehicular carnage of the chase scenes. It is, however, lazy, formulaic stuff that diminishes the brash brilliance and danger of the actor's early career work.\n\nIt's no secret that the people who control the purse strings on big Hollywood productions prefer a safe bet. Hence the voracious appetite for comforting, familiar IPs (intellectual properties), be they toys, video games, comics, TV shows, books or existing movie franchises. On the most basic level, audience familiarity with a property gives a crucial leg-up for the marketing department: it's so much easier to sell a movie if there's a pre-existing fanbase, or at the very least, enough name recognition to ensure that it glues itself into the collective consciousness.\n\nOf course, the fact that a film is based on an existing IP doesn't necessarily mean that it will inevitably be bad. But those that succeed tend to be the ones that embrace risks. Greta Gerwig took Barbie, a toy that had all but become a punchline to jokes about unrealistic expectations of female beauty, and delivered a playfully political feminist treatise . And the rebooted Planet of the Apes series elevated the franchise far beyond the crude rubber facial prosthetics and the B-movie kitsch of the early films in order to hold up a mirror to the failures of human society.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, there are films such as Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F , the sorry consequences of the twin forces of nostalgia and creative cowardice. For all the wisecracking, profanity and staggeringly ambitious stunts - and this is a film that flings a helicopter around as if it were a Frisbee - Axel F is an overly cautious movie that takes a tried-and-tested greatest hits approach to all aspects of the film-making, from the plot onwards.\n\nNowhere is this more evident than in the score, which cannibalises much of the first film's soundtrack. Axel F by Harold Faltermeyer features heavily, offering an instant dopamine hit to anyone who sneaked, underage, into the cinema in the mid-80s to see the original picture. It's a mixed blessing though: the track is so dated, it might as well be wearing leg warmers and a ra-ra skirt.\n\nBut this debut feature from Australian commercials director Mark Molloy - a man who clearly knows a thing or two about slickly packaged products - has a couple of things going for it. One is the pleasingly testy dynamic between Foley and his daughter, Jane (Taylour Paige), a Beverly Hills defence attorney who has not spoken to her father in years. It's a generic plot device certainly - watch enough American cop movies and you start to assume that they hand out crappy marriages and estranged adult children along with the police badge. But Murphy and Paige spark together, their combative energy snapping the picture into sharper focus.\n\nThen there's the bravura action direction. True to form, Foley commandeers many and various vehicles, which he then crashes into stuff, sending the denizens of LA scurrying for cover, their designer shopping bags and tiny dogs scattered to the wind. The car/lorry/golf cart chases are chaotically entertaining, and a neatly efficient way to ramp up the film's energy whenever the plot starts to feel a little draggy and familiar. Plus, if you ever wondered what happens when you drive a snowplough at speed down a narrow alleyway full of bins, you now have the opportunity to find out.\n\nUltimately, however, the point and the driving force behind this franchise has always been the opportunity to give Murphy's larger and cooler-than-life persona free rein. Now in his 60s - not quite old enough to be a US presidential candidate but not far off - the actor lacks some of the hunger and aggression that ignited his career in the 80s, but he remains a uniquely magnetic performer. And somehow he manages to bring a degree of freshness to material that was stale several decades ago.\n\nBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F is on Netflix\n\nThis is the archive of The Observer up until 21/04/2025. The Observer is now owned and operated by Tortoise Media."

      "text": "Georgia claims police not using Signal to message about 'Cop City', despite evidence to contrary\n\nDefense attorney in conspiracy case cites Guardian reporting in seeking police messages on activists opposed to training center\n\nGeorgia's deputy attorney general said in court that he didn't think police in the state were using Signal to communicate about the law enforcement training center colloquially known as \" Cop City \" - despite being presented, in a motion from defense attorneys, with evidence from the Guardian of law enforcement leadership ordering officers to download the encrypted phone app last year for that very purpose.\n\nDefense attorneys have been seeking the Signal messages from Atlanta police and other law enforcement agencies that may be relevant to their clients' cases from the deputy attorney general, John Fowler, since February, according to their 15 March motion.\n\nFowler did not respond, indicating only \"that the Signal messages were not in possession of the state\", the motion said. He repeated the claim in court this week, saying he thought only federal agencies collaborating with the Georgia prosecution used Signal.\n\nIt is unclear if the official is not telling the truth, or doesn't know how the arresting agencies in his office's effort to prosecute 61 people tied to opposition against Cop City communicate with each other.\n\n\"We are unable to comment due to pending prosecution,\" wrote the attorney general's spokesperson Kara Murray in reply to queries from the Guardian.\n\nThe revelation came in a Fulton county superior court conference for prosecuting and defense attorneys to hash out details in the state's pending Rico - or criminal conspiracy - case centered on Cop City. It is the largest Rico case in connection with a protest movement ever, experts have told the Guardian.\n\nThe fight against Cop City has drawn national and global headlines, particularly since 18 January of last year, when state troopers shot and killed Manuel Paez Terán , known as \"Tortuguita\", who was camping in protest at a public park near the Cop City site - the first such incident in US history. Opposition to the project has come from a wide range of local and national supporters, with concerns such as unchecked police militarization and clearing forests in an era of climate crisis. Atlanta police say the center is needed for \"world-class\" training.\n\nFulton county superior court judge Kimberly M Esmond Adams said on Tuesday she planned to start trials in the Rico case before the year's end, with five defendants at a time. Her job in court included ensuring the state finishes releasing its evidence to the dozens of defense attorneys involved in the case as soon as possible - after the state announced in November it had five terabytes of evidentiary data, the equivalent of about 400m pages of text, or 800,000 digital photos. On Tuesday, the state said it may have up to a terabyte more worth of data.\n\nAt one point, Judge Adams appeared to lose patience with the state, saying: \"You all indicted 61 people, so you don't get to come tell me that you're having issues with getting evidence\" - and gave until 17 May for the state to have all discovery materials filed.\n\nThat data should include Signal messages, defense attorney David Gastley asserted in his 15 March motion and, again, in court on Tuesday. He named the Guardian's 4 December 2023 reporting as the main exhibit supporting the request. Based on emails obtained through open records requests, that story established how top Atlanta police officials began setting up Signal groups in early 2023 to discuss Cop City.\n\nIn one email described in the Guardian's reporting, on 23 January Maj Jessica Bruce of the Atlanta police informed a dozen agencies: \"As we get closer to the building of the Acadamy [sic] I wish to keep everyone informed in a timely manner\" - and that she would be adding everyone receiving the email to a Signal group. The \"Acadamy\" is Cop City.\n\nSign up to First Thing\n\nOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what's happening and why it matters\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nThat email was sent to police departments in Atlanta and in Cobb and DeKalb counties - part of the Atlanta metro area - as well as the Georgia bureau of investigation, the FBI and the ATF. Police from the Norfolk Southern railroad were also copied.\n\nGastley asked in a 13 February email to the attorney general's office for \"preservation and production\" of \"[a]ll messages pertaining to the 'Stop Cop City'/'Defend the Atlanta Forest' investigation and prosecution exchanged by law enforcement on ... encrypted messaging apps such as Signal and WhatsApp\".\n\nHe named all police officials and agencies mentioned in the Guardian's reporting, asking for communications between them. He also asked for all communications about the decision to use the app, and about any policies governing its use.\n\n\"It is implausible that there are no relevant witness statements contained on these large-scale, inter-agency Signal group threads designed to communicate about the Cop City protests,\" the 15 March motion reads.\n\nDespite five emails and an in-person visit, the attorney asserts, Fowler did not respond - except to say that he didn't think the state had any such messages, but had \"a willingness to consider complying with the request\", according to the motion.\n\nThe defense attorney sums up these events in the motion, raising the possibility that messages have been deleted: \"[C]ommunications with the Attorney General's Office suggest that there has been no diligent inquiry to determine the extent of discoverable materials contained within the tranche of law enforcement Signal messages (to the extent these messages have not been deleted).\"\n\nWith Signal, users can set the app to automatically delete messages, at which point they are not even available for retrieval on computer servers, as with standard texts. First amendment and digital transparency experts told the Guardian in December that police or other government officials using encrypted apps like Signal to communicate about official business raises serious concerns about the ability to access information afterward, in accordance with \"freedom of information\" and open-records laws - and now, possibly, in response to discovery requests in state prosecutions.\n\nThe defense attorney's motion also notes in a footnote how the state's own 109-page Rico indictment refers to the use of Signal by activists against Cop City. Their \"communication is often cloaked in secrecy, using sophisticated technology aimed at preventing law enforcement from viewing their communication and preventing recovery of the information\", the indictment reads.\n\n\"In the indictment of this case, the State itself chose to include the use of the Signal messaging platform as alleged inculpatory evidence against the defendants' purported 'enterprise',\" the motion reads. \"Surely, the extent to which law enforcement itself intentionally shifted their own communications to this very same platform will be relevant evidence for the jury ... particularly if a substantial amount of law enforcement material is in fact unpreserved.\""

      "text": "Investment fund links to Atlanta police and 'Cop City' project revealed\n\nExclusive: Roark Capital and Silver Lake Management showed to have a web of connections to the Atlanta police foundation\n\nA new investigation has uncovered connections between private equity firms and the contentious development of a sprawling police and fire service training complex in Atlanta known as \"Cop City\" and the police force which fatally shot an environmental activist.\n\nPrivate equity refers to an opaque form of financing away from public markets in which funds and investors manage money for wealthy individuals and institutional investors such as university endowments and state employee pension funds.\n\nResearch shared exclusively with the Guardian details links between Roark Capital, an Atlanta-based private equity firm which owns the country's second-largest restaurant company, Inspire Brands, and a corporate backer of the Atlanta police foundation (APF).\n\nPaul Brown, the CEO of Inspire Brands, whose portfolio includes fast-food franchises Dunkin', Baskin Robbins and Arby's, sits on the board of trustees of the APF, which is raising $60m from corporate funders to build Cop City in the Atlanta forest previously earmarked for a public park.\n\nPolice foundations are non-profits which raise private money from individual and corporate donors that is funnelled to police departments with little oversight or accountability. The APF has previously helped Atlanta police fund recruitment drives, surveillance cameras and Swat team equipment.\n\nThe police crackdown on community protests against Cop City have led to dozens of charges of domestic terrorism and the police killing of the environmental activist Manuel Paez Terán, known as \"Tortuguita\". Police said Paez Terán shot at them first, but have not produced any body-cam or other video footage of the shooting.\n\nThe APF has helped Atlanta become the most surveilled city in the US in large part thanks to a program called Operation Shield.\n\nThe Silicon Valley firm Silver Lake Management, one of the world's largest tech-focused private equity firms, has invested more than $1bn in Motorola Solutions, which designed and implemented the surveillance system for Operation Shield, according to a new report by the Private Equity Stakeholder Project (PESP).\n\nMotorola has been criticised for providing hi-tech surveillance equipment used in US prisons, on the US-Mexico border and in the West Bank. Several European pension funds have divested from Motorola, and it was included in a UN list of companies \"that had raised particular human rights concerns\" by providing surveillance tools and other services to the Israeli government.\n\nOperation Shield currently boasts more than 12,800 private and public interconnected cameras monitored by the police - the highest number per capita in the country. Motorola has sold more than $22m worth of products and services to the Atlanta police department since 2016.\n\nSilver Lake Management has invested money from pension funds paid into by Texas and Ohio teachers and South Dakota and California state employees, according to PitchBook.\n\nIn 2022, Silver Lake added Shadowbox Studios (formerly Blackhall Studios), a television and film studio company, to its portfolio with a $500m investment. The studios are located south of the Cop City site.\n\nAt an APF meeting on the Cop City budget in February, the agenda included what appeared to be a discussion on a possible future relationship between Shadowbox and the APF. The meeting agenda included the following item: \"Are there any scenarios where we can come up with some agreement to work with Shadowbox for them to help fund some components and in return they have access to use the facility for filming purposes?\"\n\nThere is no evidence that Shadowbox had any knowledge of the agenda item or that it has contributed in any way to the APF.\n\n\"We've shown that private equity does have its hands in the controversy that is unfolding around Atlanta and its police force. Knowing the relationships Roark Capital and Silver Lake Management have with Cop City, [the Atlanta police department] and APF will give activists another tool to demand accountability for the recent violence and the destruction of the Georgia environment,\" said Amanda Mendoza, PESP researcher and co-author of the report.\n\nThe private equity industry manages about $11tn globally. Asset managers and funds buy and restructure companies including startups, franchises, troubled businesses and real estate operations using their clients' money. Yet unlike banks and other publicly listed companies, private equity firms are exempt from most financial disclosure rules, making it extremely difficult to track their assets - or risks.\n\nIt means people such as firefighters, nurses and teachers whose pensions are invested in private equity funds have little way of knowing if their retirement nest egg is financing police surveillance equipment, defence contractors, hospitals or coal plants.\n\nThe report Private Equity Profits from Destroying the Atlanta Forest is the latest attempt by researchers to uncloak the industry's activity.\n\nRoark Capital mostly invests in franchises like fast-food chains and in February 2023 claimed $33bn in assets under management. The company has lobbied against a federal minimum wage, and a 2020 report by the Government Accountability Office found employees at some Roark brands were among the most frequent recipients of food stamps in some states.\n\nAfter protests swept across the US in response to the 2020 police killing of George Floyd, Inspire Brands CEO and APF board member Paul Brown posted a letter on LinkedIn calling attention to \"violence\" and \"attacks\" by protesters - without mentioning the police violence that triggered the protests. (Roark's own CEO donated thousands of dollars to the former Georgia senator David Perdue as he promoted the big lie and sought to overturn the 2020 presidential election.)\n\nAnother Roark connection is Marshall Freeman, who for seven years served as chief operating officer of the APF and sits on the board of the Inspire Brands Foundation, the company's philanthropic arm. Freeman has joined the Atlanta police department as a deputy chief administrative officer.\n\nRoark has invested money from several public worker pensions funds, including those of firefighters and police in Colorado, Los Angeles city employees, Oregon and New York state workers, and Louisiana teachers, according to PitchBook.\n\n\"The enormous amounts of money at the disposal of private equity often comes from state employees and retirees, who would be very surprised to learn where their investments are going. That's why it's important to follow the money,\" said Charles Mahoney, associate professor of political science at California State University who researches private equity investments in defence and national security.\n\nRoark Capital did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Silver Lake declined to comment.\n\nAtlanta is the US's 38th most populous city, according to the 2020 census. The APF, a non-profit whose corporate backers also include UPS, Home Depot, Wells Fargo and Coca Cola, is the second-largest police foundation in the country after New York City.\n\nAccording to LittleSis, a corporate finance watchdog group, \"police foundations act as a backchannel for corporate and wealthy interests by funding policing even further, adding to already overinflated budgets without any required public oversight, approval, or accountability.\"\n\nThe Atlanta police department was allotted a third of the city's $700m budget in 2022, and has received additional money through the APF to expand its surveillance capacity and recruit more officers.\n\nLess than a week after Atlanta police shot and killed Rayshard Brooks in the summer of 2020, the APF gave every officer in the city a $500 bonus .\n\nThe APF received a record $11.7m in donations in 2021, a figure likely to rise since Georgia passed new legislation expanding personal tax breaks last year. In addition to funding the police directly, the city has also given the APF more than $3.6m since 2016 for Swat team equipment, licence plate readers and thousands of cameras for Operation Shield.\n\nMendoza said: \"When it comes to policing, which already faces severe accountability and transparency issues, private equity involvement adds an additional layer of opaqueness. This report is just scratching the surface in investigating how private equity has contributed to not only moving these dangerous projects forward but also supporting a devolving situation of violence in the city.\"\n\nPaez Terán was part of a broad social movement that opposes the $90m Cop City training complex planned for 85 acres of the South River forest, one of Atlanta's largest remaining green spaces. The social movement also opposes plans to develop 40 acres of public park in the same forest.\n\nPaez Terán's death was the first known killing by police of an environmental activist in the US. The police crackdown has continued since his death amid growing local opposition to Cop City. Community concerns include increasing police militarization and excessive force especially against Black residents, as well as losing part of a forest that had been included in 2017 plans to create what would have been the city's largest park."

      "text": "Atlanta police condemned for heavy-handed action at Cop City protest\n\nOfficers used flash-bang grenades, teargas canisters, tanks and snipers and accused participants of 'terrorism'\n\nPolice actions during a mass protest called \"Block Cop City\" that drew people from across the US to Atlanta this week have been condemned as heavy-handed after they included flash-bang grenades, teargas canisters, tanks and a press conference full of demonstrably false or misleading descriptions of the event.\n\nThe Guardian also spoke with a protester who was detained, repeatedly called a \"terrorist\", handcuffed and threatened with arrest in a supermarket parking lot near the march - only to be released with no charges.\n\nThe actions are the latest hardline display against opposition to Cop City, a sign that Atlanta authorities are determined to combat dissent on the project.\n\nThe Block Cop City action did not achieve its stated goal of occupying the site of the controversial, $90m police and fire department center known as \"Cop City\", but did shut down work for a day at the 171-acre construction footprint in a forest south-east of Atlanta.\n\nThe event drew nearly 500 people from dozens of cities and included non-violent direct action training and planning and a commitment to no property damage or weapons. Nonetheless, multiple jurisdictions deployed police to the project's construction site and streets in the surrounding area and Atlanta's police chief, Darin Schierbaum, characterized the event as a threat to public safety, citing evidence such as gas masks.\n\n\"It's absurdly hypocritical of the police,\" said Jamie Peck, an organizer who came from New York. \"They're claiming we were the violent ones, when non-violence was in the DNA of the action from the beginning. Trying to say we're violent when we brought protective gear is sort of Orwellian.\"\n\nThe march began early on Monday morning at a park several miles from the Cop City site and included between 350 and 400 marchers as well as carnival-sized puppets and a marching band. Dozens wore spray-painted, white jumpsuits - in homage, organizers said, to European environmental activists.\n\nJoel Paez and Belkis Terán warmed up the crowd - parents of Manuel Paez Terán , or \"Tortuguita\", who police shot and killed on 18 January , while the activist was camping in a forested public park about a mile from the construction site. Paez told the crowd he saw them all as \"family\". \"I pray for the safety of everyone here,\" he said. \"I pray for the generations fighting for a better world.\"\n\nThe march then wound its way through the park and toward another park that abuts the Cop City site. Police blocked a tunnel connecting the two parks, so marchers turned into a nearby neighborhood and, eventually, on to a four-lane road leading to the site's entrance.\n\nSoon after, marchers were met by a line of DeKalb county police. They had shields, teargas guns, a dog and a tank called \"The Beast\"; there were officers with automatic weapons whose uniforms read \"sniper\". As soon as the first line of marchers made contact with police, several officers aimed gas canisters and flash-bang grenades at the crowd. They also fired at a group of clearly identified members of the press who were on the shoulder of the road.\n\nAbout a dozen journalists were separated from the march. When one tried to return, an officer blocked him on the public road and said, \"this is an active crime scene\". Another officer later let him return to doing his job.\n\nOne protester who had come from Arizona to participate in the action had gone to a nearby supermarket with another protester. The activist, who uses they/them pronouns, didn't want the Guardian using their name.\n\nThe activists were sitting together in a car watching a live feed of the march when police approached. \"What are you doing here? Commanding the action from your car?\" asked one officer. Police repeatedly accused the activist about \"inciting crimes\", of being a \"terrorist\". Officers asked, \"Why do you come to our town to mess things up?\" One said: \"You don't even know what this project is about - there's crime in this town, and you need us.\"\n\nThe officers also separated the two; the Arizonan later discovered their fellow protester had been arrested after supplying a false name and released on misdemeanor charges.\n\nMeanwhile, officers eventually told the 39-year-old human resources professional they were free to go - until a plainclothes officer came behind them and said they were being arrested for \"conspiracy to commit acts of terrorism\". Another officer then asked them if they possessed incendiary devices. They were eventually released.\n\nThe language of terrorism echoes the state of Georgia's recent indictment and arraignment of 61 people in connection with Cop City under the state's Rico, or racketeering law, accusing them of forming a conspiracy.\n\nAt a later press conference Schierbaum, the police chief, told the public that police had kept the city safe from dangerous people who were \"prepared to do harm, prepared to do destruction\".\n\nHe displayed evidence of his claims such as tools used to plant trees by a roadside, gas masks and bolt cutters - presumably intended to cut through the fence surrounding the construction site. Ample video evidence exists of the peaceful roadside tree planting and it was police who used teargas.\n\nAtlanta police did not respond to the Guardian's request for comment.\n\nThe Arizonan activist decided to get away for awhile, and drove to the (Martin Luther) King Center in Atlanta. \"I just cried for awhile. I thought, 'This isn't your legacy. This isn't what you dreamed of.'\""

      "text": "Former Edmonton cop Derek Huff blows whistle on brutality, corruption\n\nEx-officer blows whistle on brutality\n\nA former cop with an exemplary record is going public about what he calls corruption in Edmonton police ranks, after he tried internally to expose what he believes is organized brutality, but got no results.\n\n\"I stood up for what's right, and I just got run out of the police service,\" said Derek Huff, 37. \"I still can't even really believe it.\"\n\nHuff is a 10-year-veteran who resigned in February, three years after he said he and his partner watched - stunned - as three plainclothes officers viciously beat a handcuffed man while he was down.\n\n\"They basically had their knees on his back and were just punching and kicking him just as hard as they could ...six fists just pummelling this guy ... I could hear him screaming,\" said Huff.\n\nHe reported what he saw - and his allegations are now being investigated - but he said until recently the alleged assault was kept quiet.\n\n\"I can still remember the sounds of the contact of the knuckles hitting his face... I've seen lots of arrests and I've never seen anything like that.\"\n\nHuff said the main instigator was Constable Jack Redlick, now 30. Before joining the Edmonton Police Service, Redlick, who is six foot three inches tall, was a hockey defenceman who was notorious for his fights on ice.\n\nThe alleged victim, according to Huff, was Kasimierz Kozina, who was 29 at the time. Redlick and the other officers had targeted the suspected drug dealer in a sting.\n\nHuff said Kozina was much smaller than Redlick - and the attack was unprovoked.\n\n\"I compared it to the Rodney King beating,\" said Huff. \"My first initial thought [was] that 'I want to get in this car and get out of here as fast as I can.' [My partner and I] were in shock.\"\n\nBack at the downtown police station, Huff said he saw Kozina being taken away by ambulance.\n\n\"His face was a great big giant black ball ... of blood and bruising,\" said Huff. \"It looked like he had a gotten into a full head-on collision and smashed his head into a steering wheel.\"\n\nHuff said he and his partner Mike Furman agonized over what to do. They felt they had two choices; \"rat\" on their fellow officers or - if Kozina complained - they might be forced to lie later, to protect their jobs, because they were there.\n\n\"We had a big decision to make,\" said Huff.\n\nThe next day, Huff said he and Furman told their sergeant what they'd seen. They were so scared, Huff said, they met their boss in a police cruiser and didn't put anything in writing.\n\nIn the meantime, Huff said Kozina needed surgery to repair his face. He never did file a complaint, though.\n\n\"If a pack of police officers handcuffed me and put me in the hospital and nothing happened, I'd be pretty scared of them,\" said Huff, who said nothing came of their report to their boss, either.\n\n\"[The sergeant] came back and said that he read all the reports that were submitted and as far as he's concerned it justifies the actions that Redlick and his partners took, and that Mike and I no longer need to be involved,\" he said.\n\n\"I couldn't believe it. Even to this day I still can't believe it.\"\n\nHuff suggested the other officers involved lied, by telling the sergeant Kozina attacked first.\n\n\"People stick to a story. They cover things up. They want to justify beating people up,\" said Huff. \"I ran into corruption. Covering up evidence is corruption.\"\n\nGo Public is an investigative news segment on CBC TV, radio and the web.\n\nWe tell your stories and hold the powers that be accountable.\n\nWe want to hear from people across the country with stories they want to make public.\n\nSubmit your story ideas to Kathy Tomlinson at Go Public\n\nFollow @CBCGoPublic on Twitter\n\nHe said he and his partner were then branded as \"rats\" and were mocked and shunned. Huff said it got so bad, when he and Furman called for backup on the street, no one came.\n\n\"I went from having a great career to being a rat - and it's almost like jail,\" said Huff. \"If you're labelled a rat in the police service, you're done.\"\n\nGo Public contacted Redlick for comment on all of this, but he didn't respond. We also asked to talk to Furman. A police spokesperson said neither officer is allowed to talk about this case because it hasn't been resolved.\n\nHuff said the ostracizing became so unbearable, he couldn't function at work. He went to other supervisors and managers for help, but he said no one did anything about the root problem.\n\n\"Every time I tried to talk to superiors, they would minimize it - into me and my partner having a problem with these beat guys,\" said Huff. \"And I kept saying, 'That's not the problem.'\"\n\nTwo years after witnessing the alleged police brutality, Huff said he went to the deputy chief and revealed all, in a formal, written complaint. It was sent to the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT), which investigates police misconduct.\n\nHe also went on stress leave. The investigation into his complaint was completed six months ago, but he's still waiting to hear the outcome. In the meantime, Huff was ordered back to work in the same division. He quit instead.\n\n\"I gave up. I sacrificed my career. I stood up for what's right, and I just got run out of the police service. I thought there is nothing else I could do. I lost.\"\n\nSince Huff initially reported the alleged beating, Redlick has been investigated for other violent police incidents.\n\nIn 2011, he shot and killed a 17-year-old aboriginal boy. Police who were there said the teen, Cyrus Green, had fled the scene of a robbery and was threatening them with a knife and a baseball bat.\n\nRedlick shot the teen three times. The officer was cleared of wrongdoing, but the boy's mother is suing him.\n\nThen, last year, Redlick picked up a man in his 50s and beat him up in a schoolyard. Redlick later admitted to that in a statement of fact agreed to during a disciplinary action.\n\nThe officer and his partner had arrested George Petropolous after his mother called to say he'd hit her during an argument.\n\nRedlick rode in the back seat of the cruiser with Petropolous and then told his partner to pull in to a high school parking lot.\n\nRedlick took the handcuffs off Petropolous and walked him to an area where they couldn't be seen. Petropolous said the officer then put him face down in the snow and punched him repeatedly - while holding his head.\n\n\"He knew what he was doing exactly. I could tell that this man is trained,\" said Petropolous, who said he was terrified.\n\n\"I was in a tremendous amount of pain - to the point that I couldn't breathe from the punches ... there is something wrong with him.\"\n\nPetropolous's lawyer said the allegations his client was arrested for turned out to be unfounded. The charges were stayed.\n\n\"But Redlick just shows up. No investigation. Just on basis of a complaint - decides to beat him up and administers street justice,\" said Tom Engel.\n\nPetropolous filed a complaint against Redlick, alleging the officer told him he wasn't the first to get beaten up.\n\n\"He says, 'I've done it to other inmates before. I've taken them out of the car. Some of them wouldn't come out. They were crying and begging,'\" said Petropolous.\n\nAt first, Redlick and his partner denied wrongdoing. Redlick then pleaded guilty to misconduct and was docked $15,000 pay. His partner now faces discipline for lying to protect him.\n\nThe file was sent to the Crown, but no charges were laid. However, a spokesperson from Alberta Justice said because of \"other recent information\" the Crown is now \"re-examining the evidence.\"\n\nThe disciplinary decision on Redlick said he was suffering from \"mental health issues.\" Because he had no previous disciplinary citations on his record, it stated, \"This was clearly an isolated incident.\"\n\nPetropolous's lawyer said that is outrageous, especially given what Huff reported years earlier. He can't understand why Redlick is still on the job.\n\n\"I've been told this guy has been doing this for a long time,\" said Engel, who has filed an appeal. \"They have a cop who goes vigilante ... if you don't fired for doing that, what do you get fired for?\"\n\n\"There were so many people inside the organization that knew what Redlick was doing, they knew he was doing this to people, but yet they continue on,\" said Huff.\n\nRod Knecht has been Edmonton's police chief since 2011. He told Go Public he knew nothing about Huff's initial allegations until last year. He said he also wasn't aware of why Huff had resigned.\n\n\"Obviously if the good cop goes and the bad cop stays, that's not a good thing,\" said Knecht. \"Could things have been done differently? Absolutely.\"\n\nWhen he came on as chief, Knecht promised to protect whistleblowers. He's now promising to take Huff's allegations seriously.\n\n\"Obviously it's intolerable behaviour. We don't accept that as tolerable behaviour at all. An officer committing a criminal act - or act against the Police Act - we won't tolerate that in this organization and we'll deal with it.\"\n\nDespite what's happened, Huff said he still loves being a cop and wants his job back once this is resolved.\n\n\"I did absolutely nothing wrong,\" said Huff. \"All I've ever wanted since day one was the truth - and it's finally coming out.\"\n\nSubmit your story ideas to Kathy Tomlinson at Go Public\n\nFollow @CBCGoPublic on Twitter\n\nHost & Reporter\n\nKathy Tomlinson worked as an investigative reporter at CBC for more than a decade.\n\nAudience Relations, CBC P.O.

      "text": "My Truth About Being A Black Man And A Black Cop\n\nPolice veteran and retired police chief\n\nAs more and more shootings of unarmed black men and women are brought to the public's attention, I understand the distrust that many ― especially people of color ― have against police. As a black man, I've been on the receiving end of profiling and discrimination. As a father to black children, I've had to have \"the talk\" with them about how to conduct themselves in encounters with law enforcement to make sure they leave with their lives. But I'm also a cop, and I know this job is dangerous and difficult and it comes with its share of fair and unfair scrutiny.\n\nI've spent the last 30 years reconciling these unique and conflicting identities. This effort was not without its struggle. I've tried to change the perspectives of people and officers around me, I've denied that I had differing perspectives of my own, I've tried to balance each identity and fit them into a safe - often false - narrative. All of these efforts failed.\n\nThrough these experiences, and those of so many officers and people of color, I've come to realize that the only way to reconcile these perspectives is to accept each experience and the truth they represent, and to allow them to co-exist. So, here are my truths.\n\n\"Real reconciliation can only occur when it starts with the truth, no matter the level of discomfort it may cause. The truth may hurt, but selective ignorance is fatal.\"\n\nI believe the vast majority of police officers do not engage in police brutality, but when tragedies such as the killing of unarmed black people occur, I question why so many of the victims are people who look like me. I've been racially profiled by the police. I've experienced discrimination in both my personal and professional life. I can't help but to wonder if these shootings, regardless of their legality, stem from implicit bias, our society's fear of black men, racism or a combination.\n\nI see my children, especially my 20-year-old son, in the faces of the young men and women of color who have been killed by the police and who have been victims of police brutality. For black parents, teaching our children \"what to do when stopped by the police\" is a mandatory course for young people of color in this nation. I can't deny the reality that I have to protect my children from potentially deadly encounters with people whom I respect and who wear the same uniform that I wear.\n\nAnd while it may be hard for everyday people to understand, I know firsthand the complex, challenging and dangerous nature of being a police officer. As a police chief, I've had to tell a wife that her husband, one of my fellow officers, was shot and killed in the line of duty. I've seen the emotional, physical and mental toll of the job weigh down my fellow officers. It has been an honor working side by side with so many selfless servants dedicated to helping others. I have no doubt that the overwhelming majority of police officers in this country are brave and honorable public servants. But despite this, racial disparities still exist and there's a growing divide between officers and civilians along racial lines.\n\n\"Yes, we must accept that there are, in fact, some racist police officers. We must also acknowledge that the majority of cops are not racist and they honor the law enforcement profession.\"\n\nIn many ways the varying perspectives I face, and the conflicts they create, are not that different from the diversity of opinions we hear as a nation and the political discourse they have created around black lives and police brutality. In response to these differences, many choose to ignore, deny or try to change differing perspectives and the truths they represent rather than trying to understand varying viewpoints and reconcile our differences.\n\nI tried to do this in my own life, and I've learned we cannot solve the problems we face concerning police and race if we continue to lie to ourselves about the nature of the problem. Real reconciliation can only occur when it starts with the truth, no matter how inconvenient it may be; no matter the level of discomfort it may cause. The truth may hurt, but selective ignorance is fatal.\n\nWe must learn the history of policing in this country and the role police have played in enforcing discriminatory laws. The truth is, significant racial disparities still exist in our policing and criminal justice systems. Many of the systems and practices in policing that exist today were designed in the 1950s and '60s to enforce discriminatory laws and oppress black Americans who are still being and feeling oppressed at this very moment.\n\nDespite the efforts of good officers, the continued use of these draconian operational systems and practices allow structural racism to remain and spread, and it allows racists officers to operate with impunity. And yes, we must accept that there are, in fact, some racist police officers. We must also acknowledge that the vast majority of cops are not racist and they honor the law enforcement profession.\n\nIt is a dangerous job and officers face many challenges. The truth is far too many of our communities are plagued by violence that create legitimate dangers for both the police and people we serve. However, it's important to remember that race is not the cause of this community violence. The true cause is institutional racism, societal inequities in education and housing as well as law and order policies that use incarceration as a strategy for keeping the peace.\n\n\"The shooting of unarmed black men and women, police brutality and racial disparities in the criminal justice system represent a national crisis that requires a national response and presidential leadership.\"\n\nBlaming the police alone for the inequities of the criminal justice system excuses prosecutors, judges, prison systems , health care disparities, lack of access to mental health services , poor education systems , etc. All of these systems contribute to the crime and violence in our neighborhoods and the overreliance on police to solve problems that extend well beyond our capacity.\n\nOnce we accept even these basic truths, it will become easier to work together rather than remain bitterly divided; to demand accountability from the entire justice system rather than just blame the police; and to develop real solutions to our problems instead of superficial responses to the symptoms.\n\nBoth the police and community are accountable for public safety. The police must be held accountable by the community and the community must be willing to hold itself accountable as well.\n\nSuch an effort requires all of us to take responsibility for our past and our future. And it requires an all-of-government response. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders recently stated these issues are \"a local matter.\" Nothing can be further from the truth. The shooting of unarmed black men and women, police brutality and racial disparities in the criminal justice system represent a national crisis that requires a national response and presidential leadership.\n\nI'm a black man, a black father and a black cop. My struggle has not been to balance these perspectives, but to allow them to co-exist. The first step in reconciling these perspectives is to understand that each of these experiences, while different, are valid. Too often we try to either change, ignore or deny the truth. As Nelson Mandela said, \"only the truth can put the past to rest.\" Once we understand, accept and acknowledge the reality each perspective represents, maybe we can move forward to create a new truth - one in which justice is truly blind and all are treated equal under the law.\n\nRonald Davis is a 30-year police veteran and retired police chief, the former director of the United States Department of Justice, Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS), and the executive director of President Obama's Task Force on 21st Century Policing.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Virginia Cop Indicted In Murder Of Unarmed Black Teen\n\nSenior Editor, HuffPost\n\nPortsmouth, Virginia, officer Stephen Rankin was indicted on a first-degree murder charge Thursday after the fatal shooting of an unarmed black 18-year-old earlier this year.\n\nA grand jury decided to charge Rankin, who shot and killed William Chapman II outside a Walmart on April 22, according to The Virginian-Pilot . Autopsy reports obtained by the paper show that Chapman was shot in the face and chest, and that his body was carted off to the city medical examiner's office with his hands cuffed behind his back.\n\n\"After a methodical deliberation of a thorough investigation by the Virginia state police, the state's attorney determined that William Chapman was murdered by a police officer,\" Chapman family attorney Jon Michael Babineau told The Guardian. \"Today, the citizens of Portsmouth agreed.\"\n\nThe Guardian reports on the incident :\n\nThe pair had engaged in a physical struggle after Rankin tried to arrest the 18-year-old on suspicion of shoplifting, according to police. Witnesses said Chapman broke free and then stepped back towards the officer aggressively before being shot twice. The 18-year-old was the second unarmed man shot dead by Rankin in Portsmouth. An autopsy indicated Chapman was not shot at close range.\n\nThe shooting was investigated by the Virginia State Police, which passed its investigation to Portsmouth Commonwealth's Attorney Stephanie Morales earlier this month. She said last week that she'd seek an indictment in Chapman's death.\n\nRankin's lawyer said the cop's actions were justified.\n\n\"He gives Mr. Chapman commands, and it's at that point Mr. Chapman charges at him and the officer had to respond,\" Nicole Belote told WTKR.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Only A Mile And A Big World Separated Us\n\nThis is an All-American story about two kids from the east side of Baltimore.\n\nThere's me, D., a Black man straight outta the guts of systemic poverty, smothered by racism, educated in a stereotypical collection of dilapidated schools and nourished in a literal food desert where salads for dinner meant a four mile trip from home. I was raised in the crack era, where I learned to cook up, package and slang crack in and around a city that was occupied by a militarized police force that harassed everybody, even the non-crack slangers .\n\nFor more stories that stay with you, subscribe to our newsletter.\n\nThe other is Danny Hersl. He was one of six kids, and he lost his father when he was only 7. He took it rough, but he had four brothers and a sister and, with the support of their tight-knit community, the Hersls made it through.\n\nEven though his family was far from wealthy, Hersl still grew up white in white America, in a system that traditionally rewards mediocre whiteness. But although Hersl could still bask in the mighty gift of whiteness, he didn't have a lot of financial options in the new economy, with the closing of the steel mills in Baltimore which had supported generations of uneducated working-class white people. His big break came when he was accepted into the Anne Arundel County Police Academy. He spent three months there before being accepted to the Baltimore Police Department.\n\nHersl had joined the drug war, and now it wasn't just his whiteness that set him apart, but also the blue uniform and the silver badge that helped him flex that whiteness. In the largely Black neighborhoods where he policed, his word was literally law. \"I'm the police. I can do what I want,\" he often told people he stopped on the streets.\n\nNearly two decades later, you wouldn't be crazy to assume he'd gone on to become a police chief or captain, with a beautiful career and a cushy retirement, while I ended up dead on the street or cutting and stabbing my way through a life sentence in some federal prison for racketeering and narcotic possession with the intent to distribute. That's how these stories normally work out, right? Well, our story is the complete opposite: It is 2020; I am a respected author and university professor, while Hersl is a convicted felon, federal inmate 62926-037 doing hard time in MCFP Springfield, Missouri.\n\nHersl was one of seven Baltimore cops indicted by the U.S. Attorney's office in March 2017. Most of his squad, the five Black and two white officers that made up the Gun Trace Task Force when they were arrested, were charged with robbery, racketeering and numerous related charges after the feds got a wiretap on one of their phones and discovered that, instead of arresting dealers, they were robbing them-and in the case of the white sergeant, Wayne Jenkins, reselling the drugs.\n\n\"This was a great abuse of the public trust,\" Judge Catherine Blake said at Jenkins' sentencing. \"It strikes at the foundation of our entire criminal justice system.\"\n\nEventually, a few more cops were charged as well. But only Hersl and one other detective decided to stand trial and maintain their innocence. Both men were found guilty and sentenced to 18 years.\n\nInitially, like most people from my neighborhood, I celebrated Hersl's demise. I hated Danny Hersl. He stood for all the abuses and evils the BPD committed against me and my family. I thought the judge was too kind--he should be doing 70 or 80 years. Still, a crooked cop finally went to jail, and I knew he would get a chance to experience the same pain he had brought to so many innocent people. That alone gave me a reason to toast.\n\nBut, then, as I continued to try to make sense of my own life through writing, I started looking at Hersl more closely. I didn't think he was a victim-I wasn't a victim either-but I did start to think more about the failed drug war and the reasons why we both played a game that cost him his freedom, and could've cost me mine. I've always said that people needed to understand my environment before judging my past as a dope dealer. Didn't I owe the same thing to him?\n\nBack in 2001, when the best basketball games in Baltimore still took place on the jagged, stained blacktops of city parks and project courtyards, you could catch us at one of three playgrounds.\n\nWe balled for clout over at Patterson Park, balled for money at Bocek's, and we always, always ended our nights at Ellwood, the only court that had lights. It wasn't strange to see 20 or 30 people by the gates after the sun dipped and faded, running whole court games to 16, by 1's. Everybody loud, everybody the best and, when they lost, the blame normally went on everybody else. I'd normally be in the mix, but I'm thinking of one night when I could only spectate because I was nursing a slight ankle injury.\n\nStill, I stood there beside the court, running my mouth and clowning anybody who touched the basketball. \"Yoooo! You a bum, you can't shoot!\"\n\nCop cars rolled up and down Jefferson Street and past North Ellwood all the time so we didn't pay attention to them-honestly, if you played ball, and only played, police officers circling the court was a no-thought. Unless they rushed.\n\n\"One time yeroooooo! One time!\" someone yelled as a couple of police cars skidded clouds of dust across the top of the hill by the baseball diamond and a mix of plainclothes and uniforms quickly blocked both exits. \"On the ground now!\" they yelled.\n\nI didn't have hooping clothes on because of my injury, so I really wasn't in the mood to lay on the concrete. \"Get on the fuckin' ground!\" they yelled before I reluctantly complied.\n\nThese kinds of searches, where the police jumped out on a crowd of Black men, waving batons and flashlights, clutching pistols and screaming, were beyond unconstitutional and extra-illegal since they had nothing like probable cause. But we didn't really have a choice-if we allowed them to search us and we were dirty, they might only take our goods. But if we were clean and didn't allow them to search us, they might plant something on us anyway.\n\nI can't put a face on every cop who was there that night, but one uni really stood out-he wasn't old, but he wasn't young like us either. He was of medium build but probably a little thicker with his bulletproof or padded shirt on, thinning dark hair cutting across his meaty white head and a mouth that wouldn't stop running.\n\nAs I lay down on the ground, that cop kept talking. I don't remember everything he said, but I recall that he said we were \"nothing.\"\n\n\"I'm better than you,\" I said back.\n\nThat cop's corny police boot said hello to my rib. I tightened my chest, bracing for another blow that never came, and then tilted my head to the side to get a really good look at his face. I focused enough to notice his expression switch from anger to blankness to laughter in a blink. Who was this clown?\n\nWe had nothing for those guys that night, so they trotted back up the hill and I got up and brushed off my clothes. Business as usual.\n\nI didn't know it at the time, but the cop who kicked me was named Daniel T. Hersl. His boot in my ribs would mark the beginning of a 17-year relationship between two guys who had more in common than anyone would have imagined, especially us.\n\nI grew up on North Robinson -the black side of Fayette street. Hersl grew up in Highlandtown, part of the lower-middle-class, so-called hard-working white section of East Baltimore. Only a mile and a big world separated us.\n\nHersl is 10 years my senior, and we attended the same elementary and middle schools (Highlandtown and Hampstead Hill, which I was kicked out of). He went to Patterson High, like some of my older cousins. By 10th grade, truancy police regularly brought Hersl home-school wasn't for him, so his mom allowed him to drop out, providing he got his GED. He played pick-up basketball at the Highlandtown Boys and Girls Club in Patterson Park, just like me.\n\nThe club wasn't particularly Black-friendly when I played ball back there in the early '90s, a decade after Hersl ran the halls. My friends and I never would've even attended the center if it wasn't for a coach named Thurman \"Roe\" Johnson who recruited guys from our side of Orleans Street. \"I need that Black speed,\" he would always say. \"These white boys can't cut it!\"\n\nRoe was the only Black coach at the rec center and he didn't have his own van, so if we missed the last ride home, my friends and I had to walk through Patterson Park, a hangout for skinheads. All of the older dudes had stories about the chain-swinging, prematurely bald, young, white racists with tattered Doc Martens, sleeveless denim, leather gloves with the fingertips cut off and an appetite for conflict, mainly with Black kids, because they couldn't fight men. As a small child, I remember pointing to a lamppost and asking my older cousin Kevin what those little red flags were that I saw everywhere. \"Yo, that's a swat-sticks sign,\" he said, totally fucking up the pronunciation of \"swastika.\" \"You see those, you know it's racist people near.\" I don't think Hersl was one of those skinheads, but in 1999, he found a home with a gang that did far more damage to Black Baltimore than any Nazi ever did.\n\nHersl joined the BPD a year after Kurt Schmoke, the city's first elected Black mayor, announced he would not seek a fourth term. Schmoke was an extremely popular mayor, loved by many in the community and the establishment. He gained fame from introducing progressive ideas like the decriminalization of drugs and a needle exchange program in an effort to fight HIV. But when announcing he would not run, Schmoke went on record saying he didn't have any fresh ideas to address the 300-plus annual murder rate-a problem we still have, with a record-breaking 348 murders in 2019. (He is now the president of the University of Baltimore, where I work.) Schmoke's exit cleared the path for a young, ambitious white city councilman named Martin O'Malley-who soared to the top of his 16 Democratic opponents with a plan for zero tolerance and broken windows policing he'd cribbed from New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani.\n\nThe result, according to a 2016 report from the Department of Justice, was \"a massive increase in the quantity of arrests-but a corresponding decline in quality.\" O'Malley's zero tolerance policy increased the number of stop-and-frisk searches and discretionary arrests for pointless crimes like loitering and disturbing the peace. Anybody and everybody around us was going to jail for anything and everything. Walking down the street while making eye contact with a cop, riding a bike on the sidewalk, having an open container-you name it, somebody got booked for it.\n\nA disproportionate number of African Americans were mistreated, overpoliced and imprisoned. And it worked. O'Malley rode those \"tough on crime\" stats from the mayor's office to the governor's mansion. That's the climate that Hersl, who joined the force in 1999, learned to police in.\n\nLike him, I succumbed, a couple of years later, and volunteered to play my part in the war. On the other side.\n\nBefore 2001, I'd flirted with the drug game. I knew the dealers, corner stragglers, nickel shavers and block bosses all the way to the dudes who were juggling enough weight to sedate small towns. These were all people who hung in and around the neighborhood, my house even. I tried my hand, made a few transactions, but wasn't committed because I never wanted to cop out to being just another dope dealer. It wasn't a moral thing, really, I just looked in the mirror and saw a computer engineer or a lawyer staring back, not a criminal. But by the end of 2001, like many people in my age group and from my block, I sat stiff at the end of an IKEA two-chair kitchen table set, putting packages of $3, $6, $10, $20 and $50 blast together.\n\nMy best friend-who I'll call Nick to protect his family and children-worked with me, but he couldn't get the crack in the vial as quick as I could because his fingers were too fat, he talked too much and dude had a serious problem focusing. Really, nobody around me during that particular time could cap as fast. I was in a rush to get to the money, but patient enough to follow the necessary steps.\n\n\"We the next millionaires comin' out of Baldamore, Dee!\" Nick would yell, flopping his truck-wide frame all over the room, bouncing off of the damaged drywall, constantly knocking dishes off table edges with his huge ass. \"Look at all dis work!\"\n\nWe had some quick success down on Curley Street with a product we branded as \"Yeah Buddy.\" The cash poured in with steady traffic on a block that no one really paid attention to. Our little drug shop ran from about 4 p.m.  to 8 p.m. Peace is held when you split up times-some other guys hustled during the same shift as us, but they were heroin dealers. We sold crack, so our clientele was completely different. The only other crack guys came out around 10 p.m., older dudes who had day jobs or something. Everything was smooth until I found out some of them were calling their crack Yeah Buddy, pretending to be us.\n\n\"It's mainly Clarence,\" Nick said, looking at his reflection in a chrome pistol. \"We handle him, the problem over.\"\n\nI honestly didn't care if Clarence and the rest of those dudes made a couple of dollars off of the Yeah Buddy name. But the streets don't work like that-if one person ripped you off on Monday, you'd wake up to a million lined up to get you on Tuesday. It's probably the same way the cops feel when they patrol together and run up on dudes like us.\n\nI tucked my pistol in my dip and hopped shotgun in Nick's car. A wooden bat rested in the back seat, not an official baseball bat, but the mini-slugger they give you as a gift for attending Orioles home games. We drove down to Curley, just in time to see Clarence closing down his shop.\n\n\"Yo, Clarence!\" I said. \"You still selling Yeah Buddy?\"\n\n\"Fresh out, youngin',\" he replied. \"What the fuck y'all want?\"\n\nI was going to tell him that he couldn't sell it no more, and I was going to follow with a threat and some shit talk and maybe a joke because I wasn't really trying to beef with him. But then Nick swung the bat, cracking Clarence in the side of his head.\n\nI stopped the third blow and kneeled down next to Clarence.\n\n\"We not asking you no more,\" I said.\n\nClarence got up holding his head. Nick cracked him again-and this time the bat broke.\n\nThe whole Clarence situation was a boost to our reputations. Everyone ran around telling the story of how Nick and I cracked Clarence's head in half like a sunflower seed over some money. But that rep also had a downside. Working people in that neighborhood had known that Nick and I dibbled and dabbled, but we weren't looked at as violent drug dealers until that incident. We had traded the love we earned from being goofy, fun kids for the same type of fear cops like Hersl used on the streets.\n\nLike those police, we now had zero allies, and that's why Curley Street dried up-people started calling the cops, little fights started breaking out and the whole thing just became a mess. Nick and I built a small crew and set up shop a few minutes away on Madeira Street. There were no drug crews when we built the spot, but we still ended up catching static from this kid named Dress-Code.\n\nWe caught Dress-Code one night after taking the women we were dating to an R&B concert in D.C. He was on the corner sharing jokes with his crew, a little drunk. I told my date to pull the car over, reached in the glove box and pulled out my pistol.\n\n\"Dress, what's up, man?\" I said, getting out.\n\nHe said he was looking for me, before landing a hard right across my jawline, hard enough for me to feel my teeth rattle. It dazed me and I gathered myself, squaring up and dipping my chin. Nick got out of the car and sparked a blunt. Dress-Code charged at me, I grabbed his shoulders and used the momentum to sling him to the ground-his fist or elbow hit my lip again, it burst, I felt blood and spit welling up in my mouth.\n\nWe're not kidding. You should subscribe.\n\nAfter a pretty even fight, I got the upper hand. I pulled the gun out and slapped Dress across the face with it. He hit the ground, barely catching himself. I stood over him, placing both of my knees on his arm, and used the butt of the gun to beat some teeth out of his mouth. I beat him until his blood covered my shirt, until our blood mixed, until he was unconscious, until Nick pulled me off of him like, \"Chill, D Watk, you gonna kill him!\"\n\nLooking back, it was probably in that moment that I was closest to Hersl. We were both defining our territory-drawing our lines in blood and being rewarded for it. Nick and I locked down Madeira Street for a while; however, our time there didn't last long because of another cop, who worked with Hersl. \"I know exactly who you are, Lil Dwight!\" he said once, after slamming me against a wall and then his car.\n\n\"I don't know you, man-wrong guy,\" I said, turning my face away. He dug in my pocket, pulled out a couple of dollars, kept them, kicked me up my ass and told me to be on my way.\n\n\"Nick, we gotta get off this block, it's too hot,\" I warned.\n\n\"You worry too much, D. We good.\"\n\nWe weren't. By 2004, Hersl was 34 years old and had been moved into working with some plainclothes units. The plainclothes cops, who are also called knockers and jump-out boys, were all about \"proactive policing\" and stats-how many people you can throw in jail. The Maryland Judiciary Case Search shows that Hersl alone made hundreds of arrests in 2002. The next year, BPD made more than 100,000 arrests-that's roughly one-sixth of the population and a staggering 274 arrests a day.\n\nThey were patting everybody down, even the women, pocketing what they found and throwing the n-word around like it was our official title. I never carried large amounts of cash-doing so was like begging to be robbed by cops or stick-up kids-but Hersl and cops like him definitely got a few come-ups of $100 to $400 off me.\n\nHersl and a partner once clipped me for a few dollars at a bar called High Hats, probably one of the few lounges in America where customers actually have to bring their drink of choice to the establishment. We young dudes drank Belvedere, Rémy and Hennessey, but High Hats only had Ripple, Old Grand-Dad 100 and other brands that the elderly enjoyed. So we grabbed the bottles from cut-rates and left them at the bar with our names attached.\n\nSome of us young hustlers would chill there before going to work our blocks, and others would wind down with a sip after our shift. I was pregaming for a date when Hersl and another cop came in the bar, shouting the routine even though we already knew it, making all of us exit through the side door. Against the side of the building, we assumed the position: facing the wall with our hands pressed against it, legs spread and, of course, our pockets open. Hersl and his buddy patted all of our pockets, tipping themselves with whatever they found. I didn't have a lot of cash on me, $200 or $300 at most. I was upset, but not too upset because I sold drugs and paying cops like Hersl was just a tax. In those years, the cops were so fucked up, and they rolled us so much, that I didn't think that much about being robbed by a person who gets paid to protect people. A normal person would be scared, terrorized even, but because this was all part of the game we were playing, it hardly left an impression on me. Now it's hard to separate it from all the other times I'd been held up. When the cops finished being crooks, we went back inside and finished drinking.\n\nBut I remember another time, when Hersl caught me at CC's carryout with a small amount of weed. I was walking out of the store with my chicken box and a half-and-half, just in time for Hersl to line me up against the wall with the rest of the people hanging out in front of the store. He took my grass and my cash and let me go, which was cool because those dudes were locking people up for anything.\n\nEverything I had going against me he had going for him. Us young Black dudes who were slanging were hated, hunted and haunted for our role in the drug war. He was praised and honored and rewarded with overtime. Eventually I got tired of dealing, jaded even, and after a few of my friends were arrested and or murdered, I quit. Nick begged me to return, but I was done.\n\nOur neighborhood and our industry were crumbling under the weight of the drug war, and so was Nick. He had a serious pill problem, popping Oxys like Tic Tacs. Everyone knew the pills were eating at him, but it still hurt when he developed a heroin addiction. Then he pulled a gun on me.\n\nI didn't flinch as he squeezed the trigger, but shut my eyes as the hammer clicked. It clicked. He said, \"Bow!\" I opened my eyes, and it clicked again. He looked down the same barrel, said, \"Well, damn,\" put it in his dip and bumped my shoulder as he walked past me. The gun was empty. At this stage of his addiction, his swollen-bloated caramel cheeks that used to wobble when he laughed at his own jokes had completely evaporated until you could see the shape of his jaw bone. I probably could've taken the gun and beat welts onto his head, but I let him go. I started staying away from the block he was stuck to. In 2006, he was gunned down by some dudes he was robbing with and eventually stole from.\n\nIn 2007, I enrolled in the University of Baltimore-a college in the middle of the city that was known for catering to older students and helping its graduates find jobs, exactly what I needed. I was a street guy and didn't really know what to major in. I guess my background was business, but classes on that seemed boring. So I took the basics and decided to figure it out. I spent the rest of my time wandering around the city looking for a job. I had no real connections or traditional work experience-just a bunch of time and the will to submit 20-plus applications a week. Now that I was out of the game, I wasn't even really talking to my friends who were still dealing. I forgot about Hersl. But he didn't quit.\n\nThe same year I started college, a judge remarked on the 46 complaints that Hersl and his partner had racked up between them. Even though they'd each only had one of those complaints sustained, the judge noted the prevalence of the pattern. \"Misconduct, sometimes when it's frequent enough, it indicates a lack of desire to tell the truth,\" the judge said.\n\nIn May 2007, Hersl and another notorious cop-who was also an MMA fighter-spotted a 50-year-old cafeteria worker named Lillian Parker selling raffle tickets. Hersl asked her what she was doing, and she said she was waiting for a friend to come pick up her ticket. They charged her with selling drugs. She spent two days in jail, but prosecutors dropped the charges against her. When she sued the city, they settled the case for $100,000.\n\nThree months later, Hersl and his sergeant stopped several women in the Joy Garden CarryOut restaurant and tried to search them. When one of the women got smart with them, Hersl reacted violently, as he had with me. In a deposition, the woman said the cops broke her arm. \"He punched me in the arm,\" she said. She heard a loud pop and fell onto the floor. The city settled the lawsuit for $50,000.\n\nA few years later, a guy named Charles Faulkner said he fled from Hersl, who then broke Faulkner's jaw and nose with his fists and a police radio. He sued Hersl; the city settled the lawsuit for $49,000. At this point, Hersl had already cost the city close to a quarter of a million dollars in settlements.\n\nThat was around the same time that I really fell in love with reading and began to make sense of the world around me through critical thinking. It was also when I started to develop an understanding about how Baltimore works. In 2011, I felt like I might be able to change that narrative, as the first dude on my block and in my family to graduate from college. I hustled up tickets from every student I knew so that I could have my own mini-cheering section in the auditorium when I walked the stage.\n\nIn October of that year, Hersl also walked across the stage in the BPD auditorium and received the Medal of Honor for some shit that went down at 25th Street and Harford Road. Hersl and his partners saw a dude riding a bike in a leather jacket, and when they rolled up on him, he shot one of the partners in the neck. According to the cops, Hersl jumped up on the car and shot the man, Gerry Gough, who later got sentenced to life in prison. Hersl was a hero.\n\nAfter those accolades, it seems like we both hit a hard stretch. In 2013, I was in grad school at Johns Hopkins University School of Education, sitting in the back, watching aspiring teachers from as far away as Korea discuss strategies on teaching Black kids like me from Baltimore. I was the only Black kid from Baltimore in the class. Some people feel empowered by being \"the only Black guy,\" but it depressed me. I thought about guys I had to bury while I was in college, guys like Dip, Ro Ro, Free, Light Skin Kelly and especially Nick, who were just as smart as me, if not smarter. They should have been in these classes with me, not dead.\n\nHersl was dealing with the pain death carries as well. That year, his brother Matthew Hersl, 45, a city employee and lover of the Orioles, was standing in front of City Hall when he was struck by an out-of-control Acura that was being chased by a cop. Danny and Matt were a lot younger than their older siblings. They hung out and went to ball games together, where Matt was a regular and chased after fly balls. Hersl took that death extremely hard.\n\nIn 2014, our worlds came together again. I had graduated from Hopkins and was taking night classes to earn my MFA at the University of Baltimore. During the day, I worked as a substitute and then a resource teacher at Friendship Academy of Engineering and Technology, where one of my students introduced me to Young Moose.\n\nYoung Moose, whose legal name is Kevron Evans, was a rapper from my neighborhood.  My students bumped his music religiously. It excited me that he referenced the same blocks and neighborhoods that Nick and I used to run. Most rappers from the city kind of pretended to be from New York, but Moose was all Baltimore, all day. I downloaded his tape \"O.T.M. 2\" (Out The Mud) and fell in love with the music, especially \"F**k Da Police\" where he called out Hersl's corruption during the intro: \"Muthafuckin' whores man! Yeah nigga fuck the police-Lil Head, Mike Fries, Hersl ... I want all you bitches to die. They keep fuckin' with us, they keep on harassin'!\" He went even harder on \"Tired\" from his 2015 mixtape, \"O.T.M 3,\" saying, \"Detective Hersl, he a bitch, I swear to God he ain't right. Heard about my rap career, he tryin' to fuck up my life.\"\n\nI became interested in writing about Moose almost immediately after hearing his music, and even more after I heard the Hersl connection. I remembered what Hersl thought about people like me: \"nothing.\" I could still hear the word from our first encounter. However much we hated him, it seemed, he hated us more. After reaching out to Moose's girlfriend, who was a student at Coppin State University where I was now an adjunct professor, we started talking.\n\nIn 2014, Hersl used Moose's lyrics and the video from his song \"Posted\" as a piece of the evidence to get a search warrant to raid his house, writing that he had been \"advised by numerous police officers that Kevron Evans has numerous rap music videos\" on YouTube in which , Hersl claimed, he observed Moose and his associates \"in possession of multiple firearms.\"\n\nHersl locked up Moose's whole family: his mom, his dad and his two brothers. But Moose wasn't home. In his bail review, Moose's lawyer claimed Hersl told the rest of the family that he was aware  Moose was scheduled to perform with underground rap legend Boosie Badazz and that \"he would make sure that Kevron did not have any chance to perform at that concert.\" The show could have been career-changing for Moose, but instead he was sitting in a cell. Hersl made $111,271.73, almost half of which came in overtime, that year.\n\nYoung Moose's lyrics landed because his experience was so common. And now that cellphone videos had begun to capture police abuse in the Black community, white people were finally paying attention. On April 12, 2015, Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old unarmed Black man, was chilling with his friends in West Baltimore when he was harassed, chased and arrested for having a knife that is sold in corner stores and gas stations all over the city. Gray was killed by the negligence of Baltimore police officers, who threw him into the van headfirst. He sustained a neck injury. If they had taken him to the hospital when he asked, he could still be alive; even if they had just followed their own protocol, he could still be alive. But they didn't.\n\nWe all knew that could have easily happened to me, to Young Moose or to any other young Black man in Baltimore. Suddenly, people were interested in hearing about our experiences, while Hersl, who was filmed showering protesters with pepper spray and pulling a reporter to the ground, became one of the most prominent faces of police violence. Hersl's colleagues have said they noticed his spirits were low after that. Like a lot of cops used to ruling the city, he felt betrayed by the police command that told them to stand down as the CVS burned. Shortly afterward, Hersl was transferred out of the Eastern District and into the Gun Trace Task Force-a group of so-called elite plainclothes cops responsible for getting weapons off the streets and targeting the community's most violent criminals. The gang, led by Wayne Jenkins, included Hersl, Evodio Hendrix, Maurice Ward, Marcus Taylor, Jemell Rayam and Momodu Gondo. Later, two more Baltimore police sergeants, a detective and an officer in Philadelphia pleaded guilty to related charges.\n\nBut just so you don't think this is a story about how we are finally getting justice in America, it's important to say that the feds never would have done anything about Hersl if they hadn't been targeting the GTTF's Detective Momodu Gondo, a Black guy from Northeast Baltimore who they suspected was working with a drug crew.\n\nAntonio Shropshire and Glen Kyle Wells, a lifelong friend of Gondo's, weren't selling crack like I had. Things had moved to heroin, and they were selling dope out of the Alameda Shopping Center to white users from a nearby county. When white kids started overdosing, law enforcement got interested and traced the drugs back to Baltimore. After they got a wiretap on Shropshire's phone, they heard him call Gondo for advice in March 2016 and tapped Gondo's phone as well. Almost immediately, the cops realized it wasn't just that Gondo was working with dealers-the cops were robbing suspects daily.\n\nAll of that got worse in June 2016, when Jenkins, another rowdy white boy, took over the squad. Jenkins, a sergeant, was an ambitious criminal mastermind who later admitted that he had robbed more than $100,000 from one dealer shortly before taking over the squad. Hersl didn't have that kind of ambition, but he had known Jenkins for a long time-in 2008, a suspect claimed in court that Jenkins and Hersl crashed into his car, broke his window with a pistol and pulled him out through the broken glass. The judge did not believe him.\n\nThe GTTF was robbing, stealing and dealing. They were also getting roughly a gun a night, earning tons of overtime, and garnering all sorts of praise. In October 2016, the police department newsletter praised the work of the GTTF, which is funny because the feds later showed that during that whole month, Hersl hardly showed up for work and spent his time working on his house while charging the department overtime.\n\nIn January 2017, Hersl and Jenkins took a young cop named James Kostoplis on a ride and asked what he thought about stealing money from big drug dealers. \"That's a fucking terrible idea,\" said Kostoplis, who they called K-Stop. He failed the test and was transferred.\n\nHersl got a transfer, too. His family says he'd been trying to get out of the GTTF for a long time and that he finally got a post in the Citywide Shooting Unit a few weeks before everything fell apart.\n\nOn March 1, 2017, Daniel Hersl went to a meeting at the headquarters of the Internal Affairs Division. When he got off the elevator, he was arrested by FBI agents and charged under the RICO Act, which had been created to bring down mobsters.\n\nReading about Hersl's indictment on my Twitter feed was transformative. I started texting all of my friends with Hersl stories and joking with Moose's manager on the phone. I'd learned from the Freddie Gray incident just how difficult it was to convict cops, but this was still a moment. Arguably the most hated cop in Baltimore was going down, and I lived to see it.\n\nHersl was one of two GTTF members to plead not guilty, even though he was facing more than 20 years in prison. He had long ago lost the dark hair he had when we first met, and when he sat at the defense table, the court lights bounced off of his gleaming head. His equally bald lawyer, William Purpura, had also represented El Chapo. Hersl's defense was brilliant and hilarious. Purpura argued that Hersl may have stolen but he did not rob, because, as a cop, Hersl had a right to take the money from people and just failed to return it.\n\nHersl's family, all looking just like him, came in every day with a cooler for their lunch. One of the prosecutors played a tape from a bug they had in Gondo's car. This one night in August 2016, GTTF was chasing a dude through downtown, and he crashed into another driver when he ran a red light. This was right by the hospital, but instead of getting help, the cops sat there and worried about getting caught. \"These car chases, it's a crapshoot, you know,\" Hersl's recorded voice said. He actually laughed. Cold-blooded, especially knowing that his brother died in the same way.\n\nSteve Hersl had stood in front of the TV cameras, wailing and crying when Matt Hersl died. In 2018, when the jury convicted Daniel Hersl of robbery and racketeering, Steve did the same thing. \"Let's talk about the corruption on top. Everybody starts from the bottom, the little guy,\" he said, weeping outside the courthouse. \"My brother Danny Hersl wasn't part of this gang.\"\n\nThat second part was bullshit. But Steve wasn't lying when he talked about corruption up top. Detective Sean Suiter had been killed the day before he was supposed to testify to the grand jury about the GTTF. His death has been the source of much controversy, with an official review board calling it a suicide and the medical examiner ruling it a homicide. Then Deputy Commissioner Dean Palmere resigned in the middle of the trial, after Gondo testified that Palmere had helped cover up a fatal police shooting-Palmere said he'd been planning his retirement for some time and that the announcement was unrelated. Apparently, he had some beef with the new commissioner, Darryl De Sousa, who was later sentenced to almost a year in prison for failing to file individual federal tax returns. This past November, Catherine Pugh, who was the mayor at the time of the trial, was indicted on 11 federal charges related to a children's book scam that netted her nearly a million bucks. She caught just three years with the feds.\n\nSo, Steve Hersl had some kind of point. Like me when I was on the streets, Daniel Hersl was part of a larger culture. Steve seemed kind of unhinged, but I thought I should try to talk to Hersl's family, so I got in touch with his brother Jerome.\n\nI instantly recognized Jerome Hersl because he looks like an older version of Danny-the way Danny will probably look after his first 10 years in prison. He asked if we could meet at the University of Maryland downtown, which isn't too far from the University of Baltimore, where I teach. He brought his wife, and the three of us shuffled into a quiet conference room. I wanted to talk about his brother, but he wanted to wait for a professor who he said would be joining us. \"She's an African American woman, and is aware of the work I'm doing in Harford County,\" he said. He opened a folder and handed me a collection of pamphlets he'd published, titled \"African-American History of Harford County, Maryland. A Weekly Publication.\"\n\n\"You do these every week?\" I asked.\n\n\"We were,\" he replied. \"But it became a lot to handle, so now I publish biweekly or monthly.\"\n\nJerome explained that the Black people of Harford County would take more pride in their community if they knew how their people contributed to its history. He was so passionate that he went on about it for almost two hours.\n\nJerome had a clear mission in elevating Blackness in a weird, unintentionally racist way. Who is he to say that Black people who commit crimes-or in general-don't take pride in Harford County? Most people, Black or white or whatever, commit crimes or damage property because they are poor. His pamphlets could not cure the ills of systemic poverty.\n\nBut even so, I was sort of impressed. It was bizarre that Danny Hersl, a person who I envisioned as super racist, had a brother with such an interest in Black history.\n\nHe assured me that Daniel was not a racist.\nI pretty much knew the professor wasn't showing up, so we had to get to business. Jerome said he didn't want to talk about the case because he believed his brother was innocent and his appeal was still pending, but he told me some things about Danny's childhood. How he was a rough kid but had a good heart and how he was a great athlete and dreamed of making it as a professional baseball player. I laughed because it sounded like my childhood bio. And, like me, Hersl started having run-ins with the law early on.\n\nJerome couldn't help but giggle when he told the story of how Danny tore the butt of his jeans out while running from the cops as a teenager. And how he was proud when Danny got his head on straight, earned his GED and got a job at Northern High as a school police. Danny made the family even prouder when he graduated from police academy. Jerome became emotional, pounding his hand into his fist and pausing for breath when he told the story of how Danny saved his partner's life and was honored by the department. The unexpected death of their brother Matt tore Danny to pieces, Jerome said, but he dealt with the pain by becoming a better father and officer.\n\n\"He was grouped in with the Gun Trace Task Force, but he wasn't one of those guys,\" Jerome said.\n\n\"But he stole money!\" I interrupted.\n\nJerome's wife, who had been sitting there silently, started shaking her head.\n\n\"That's all hearsay,\" Jerome said.\n\nI asked him about the case of April Sims . Hersl, along with detectives Gondo and Jenkins, went into her house because they thought she had tens of thousands of dollars there. Jenkins laid out the plan for entering her unit and stealing the cash. According to Gondo's testimony, Hersl replied, \"I can use the money. I'm in the process of buying a house.\"\n\nThere wasn't any cash in the condo, but Hersl was convicted of stealing designer handbags he gave to Gondo.\n\n\"I don't think that is true,\" Jerome replied. \"Gondo saying it doesn't make it true.\"\n\nHe repeated that if his brother had done anything wrong, or got caught on tape participating in a crime, it was because Jenkins had made him do it.\n\nI leaned in, looked Jerome in the eye and told him that his brother had stolen from me, personally, before he got with Jenkins.\n\n\"I never got too upset because he probably could've taken me to prison,\" I told Jerome. \"But he didn't.\"\nJerome maintained his position, saying he believed his brother was 100 percent innocent.\n\n\"So, all these people, including me, are lying?\" I asked.\n\n\"The sad truth is that Hersl had to grow up without his dad, and now his son may have to do the same,\" Jerome said.\n\nThat was a bullshit deflection, but as I left, I thought about what he said. I had a great relationship with my father and still ended up in the streets, because he wasn't my only influence. Many people attribute most of my past to the culture I was raised in. Like Hersl, I lost a brother. I lost a best friend, and plenty of other people as well. Those deaths sent me crazy, but ultimately didn't make me into a criminal-my greed did.\n\nOn one of the federal wiretaps, Gondo can be heard talking with Jemell Rayam, a GTTF co-conspirator, about getting someone to sign their overtime slips. \"Dan probably at the bar, yo,\" Gondo says.\n\nI'd been wondering about the other influences on Hersl's life, so I figured I'd better go to the bar, too. I spent the next several weeks crossing over to the other side of Patterson Park and into the world that made Danny Hersl.\nOn the first night, I rolled up there with one of my white friends. He's a reporter who has covered Baltimore for a long time and has extensive knowledge of GTTF. Angle Inn is in more of a lower- to middle-class white area, so I figured a Black guy with a white friend might make the locals more comfortable.\n\nIt's a nice-looking bar-TVs on the wall, dartboards and a cool outdoor area in the rear. We sat at the end of the bar. I ordered whiskey, he ordered a beer, and we both got steamed shrimp and codfish cakes. There were about 10 people lingering around the bar-all white, and they all appeared to be regulars. They seemed pretty cliqued up, so I didn't bother talking to them. I just ate my shrimp and plotted on my next visit.\n\nThe bartender told me they only had happy hour on Fridays, so I pulled up the following Friday and took my same seat. This time, it was crowded-the patrons were looser and it was easier for me to spark conversations. I made a point to not bring up police or politics-just the Ravens, the O's and how drunk I was. I wasn't really that drunk, but the guys around the bar were really into exclaiming, \"I'm so hammered, man! I'm tanked!\" So I just joined in.\n\nSoon, I was used to these bars and I started asking around about Hersl.\n\n\"Aye, you guys know Danny Hersl?\" I asked a group of three white guys. \"You know, the cop?\"\n\nOne of the guys got up and left. The other, who had a deep red tan, said, \"I miss that asshole!\" He told me they'd often bumped heads-and about the time they had gotten into a fight with each other when they went to Ocean City with a bunch of other Highlandtown guys.\n\nBut, he said, later the same night when some Delaware dudes came for them, Danny was there for him. \"Of all the Baltimore dudes who knew me in that place, Danny was the only one who had my back. Even though we were mad at each other, we kicked those guys' asses,\" he said.\n\n\"My whole section of East Baltimore always just saw him as a racist cop,\" I said.\n\nThe tan dude, who didn't want to be named in a story, laughed and said Danny was a whole lot of things, but he didn't have a racist bone in his body. \"He was extra friendly to this little cute Black stripper over at the Ritz!\" he said. \"That's where we need to be!\"\n\n\"Pressing down on a Black stripper doesn't mean you not a racist. It means you are horny,\" I pointed out.\n\n\"Look at the crew he went down with, they were all Black except the boss, plenty of Black guys come through the neighborhood and they were all his friends. They are all our friends,\" he said. \"Danny's a firecracker. He's a follower. Danny isn't the smartest. He's loyal, which probably got him into trouble. But he's no racist. If he racist, then I'm racist!\"\n\nI'd never voluntarily sat down with a cop before. But I thought Larry Smith Jr., a former Internal Affairs detective, might be able to help me understand how Hersl got away with it for so long or what it was about police culture that made him who he was. Like me, Smith had gotten out of the game and was trying to make a living as a writer.\n\nWe met at a nice cafe in Southeast Baltimore, not too far away from where Smith had once patrolled. Smith had a neatly shaved salt-and-pepper beard and a gray sports coat coupled with boot-cut jeans that evenly blanketed his shoes. Real clean and polished-he didn't look like a former cop, I guess in the same way people say I don't look like I teach at a university.\n\nLike Hersl, Smith became an officer in 1999. \"Making the transition from civilian to cop was overwhelming,\" Smith told me. \"I wasn't accustomed to exerting any type of authority,\" he wrote in an article published on Medium, \"and now, after six short months, I was given the power to take away someone's freedom and the instruments to take someone's life.\"\n\nSmith explained the culture of the department to me. \"Cops were being praised and rewarded for making 30 arrests in a month, but no one was talking about how half of those arrests were for things like public urinating,\" he said.\n\nHe didn't break the rules like Hersl did-but he still didn't feel like what he was doing, what the rules told him to do, was right.\n\nIn 2013, there was an opening for a detective in the Internal Affairs Division, and Smith thought having the power to punish crooked cops could be way more honorable than arresting people for nuisance crimes on the street. The system was screwed up; in IAD, he thought, he might be able to change that. He was wrong.\n\n\"Internal Affairs is just cops investigating cops,\" Smith said. \"That's the reason why nothing gets done.\"\n\nHe said they needed a whole separate unit to deal with complaints against Hersl, but the investigations were rarely taken seriously. If IAD detectives weren't friends with the cops they investigated, they were bullied and intimidated by them and had almost no power. If he felt omnipotent when dealing with the public, he felt powerless when it came to other cops.\n\nAfter years on the job, Smith couldn't take it anymore. He suffered from PTSD, and he told me he'd tried to kill himself and felt abandoned by the department. \"The 18 years of murders, shootings and whatever you can think of has affected me,\" he said. In his eyes, I could see the same thing I saw in the eyes of friends like Nick who had stayed in the game too long-except Smith made it out of the drug war and Nick didn't.\n\nSmith was one of the nicest guys I ever met. He knew I wanted to question him for my story when I invited him to dinner, but he still offered to pay-even though he was unemployed at the time. He now works in retail management and writes.\n\nLike Hersl, he had once been a cop who prided himself on arresting as many people as possible. If Smith could grow and see the mistake of ruining people's lives to bring in small stats and overtime, then doesn't he deserve to be judged on that growth?\n\nI can say the same for Hersl and myself. We are all products of the culture we lived in, but we still have the ability to make choices.\n\nI had no interest in selling drugs until the opportunity intertwined with my need for money. But I learned from my mistakes and I work at being a better person. Even though Larry Smith didn't steal, police culture made him lock up people to maintain petty stats-and when he recognized that he was wrong, he stopped. Hersl was also a product of the climate he learned to police in, but he coupled it with greed, and now his young son is growing up without a father.\n\nAt his sentencing, Hersl's lawyers read some of the letters he wrote to his son and other members of his family. \"Hi, little boy. I hope you're doing well and being a good boy for Mommy,\" he wrote in one letter. \"I also hope your summer vacation is going good. I bet you like sleeping in and going to bed late.\"\n\nBut to the rest of his family, he wasn't so cheerful. \"I finally got to go outside yesterday for the first time in over two months,\" Hersl wrote to his family when he was put on lockdown. \"I have to admit that I actually had tears in my eyes as I walked around the yard for the whole hour I was allowed to stay out.\"\n\nI don't feel sorry for Daniel Hersl. He separated scores of fathers from their sons, ruined families and sucked up overtime money from a city that can't even keep its schools heated. But my lack of sympathy doesn't come from a place of bitterness. I didn't expect him to feel sorry for me when he kicked my ribs or took my money, and I wouldn't expect him to feel sorry for me if I'd been gunned down in the streets during my hustling days, or even now as I try to pull kids off the corner. Aside from race, as far as I can tell, the difference between us two all-American East Baltimore boys is that I know I did some pretty bad things, realized it before I got caught and now spend my days trying to make it right, and he didn't.\n\nIn November, Hersl lost his appeal. He still refuses to accept responsibility and continues writing letters and proclaiming his innocence. If he doesn't get it by now, then part of me thinks he never will. I even wrote Hersl a letter, asking for his side of the story and offering him a chance to explain why he robbed me and other people and why he is still trying to deny his role in the crimes he was convicted for. He didn't respond.\n\nIf you ask why I changed and why he didn't, the answer lies in the nature of the system. On my side, we were constantly reminded that we would either end up dead or in jail-society's Black boy mantra. Many of us hustled because we lacked options, but we knew it was a bad choice, even though, at times, we loved it.\n\nFor Hersl, I imagine it was different. He chose a profession that allowed him to be praised, defended and protected. He carried with him all of the power of the state. And when he fucked up, the state had his back, to the point where it bent the law to cover for him. The laws were on his side. Many of the citizens, judges and prosecutors who allowed him to function were on his side. I was seen as a superpredator while he got to be a superhero.\n\nIt's not at all remarkable that Hersl didn't change, because he never had to be held accountable. America didn't give me any tools to change, and it didn't give Daniel Hersl any reason to change. But instead of addressing these problems, it treats us both as exceptions, rewarding me and locking him away, so that it can forget about these particular East Baltimore boys and let the game go on.\n\nMike wanted to protect a co-worker from harassment. He didn't expect his own life to be destroyed in the process.\n\nGaming the lottery seemed as good a retirement plan as any.\n\nBrock Turner's twisted legacy and Michele Dauber's relentless pursuit of justice.\n\nWeâre trying to eliminate sweatshops and child labor by buying right. But thatâs not how the world works."

      "text": "Only A Mile And A Big World Separated Us\n\nThis is an All-American story about two kids from the east side of Baltimore.\n\nThere's me, D., a Black man straight outta the guts of systemic poverty, smothered by racism, educated in a stereotypical collection of dilapidated schools and nourished in a literal food desert where salads for dinner meant a four mile trip from home. I was raised in the crack era, where I learned to cook up, package and slang crack in and around a city that was occupied by a militarized police force that harassed everybody, even the non-crack slangers .\n\nFor more stories that stay with you, subscribe to our newsletter.\n\nThe other is Danny Hersl. He was one of six kids, and he lost his father when he was only 7. He took it rough, but he had four brothers and a sister and, with the support of their tight-knit community, the Hersls made it through.\n\nEven though his family was far from wealthy, Hersl still grew up white in white America, in a system that traditionally rewards mediocre whiteness. But although Hersl could still bask in the mighty gift of whiteness, he didn't have a lot of financial options in the new economy, with the closing of the steel mills in Baltimore which had supported generations of uneducated working-class white people. His big break came when he was accepted into the Anne Arundel County Police Academy. He spent three months there before being accepted to the Baltimore Police Department.\n\nHersl had joined the drug war, and now it wasn't just his whiteness that set him apart, but also the blue uniform and the silver badge that helped him flex that whiteness. In the largely Black neighborhoods where he policed, his word was literally law. \"I'm the police. I can do what I want,\" he often told people he stopped on the streets.\n\nNearly two decades later, you wouldn't be crazy to assume he'd gone on to become a police chief or captain, with a beautiful career and a cushy retirement, while I ended up dead on the street or cutting and stabbing my way through a life sentence in some federal prison for racketeering and narcotic possession with the intent to distribute. That's how these stories normally work out, right? Well, our story is the complete opposite: It is 2020; I am a respected author and university professor, while Hersl is a convicted felon, federal inmate 62926-037 doing hard time in MCFP Springfield, Missouri.\n\nHersl was one of seven Baltimore cops indicted by the U.S. Attorney's office in March 2017. Most of his squad, the five Black and two white officers that made up the Gun Trace Task Force when they were arrested, were charged with robbery, racketeering and numerous related charges after the feds got a wiretap on one of their phones and discovered that, instead of arresting dealers, they were robbing them-and in the case of the white sergeant, Wayne Jenkins, reselling the drugs.\n\n\"This was a great abuse of the public trust,\" Judge Catherine Blake said at Jenkins' sentencing. \"It strikes at the foundation of our entire criminal justice system.\"\n\nEventually, a few more cops were charged as well. But only Hersl and one other detective decided to stand trial and maintain their innocence. Both men were found guilty and sentenced to 18 years.\n\nInitially, like most people from my neighborhood, I celebrated Hersl's demise. I hated Danny Hersl. He stood for all the abuses and evils the BPD committed against me and my family. I thought the judge was too kind--he should be doing 70 or 80 years. Still, a crooked cop finally went to jail, and I knew he would get a chance to experience the same pain he had brought to so many innocent people. That alone gave me a reason to toast.\n\nBut, then, as I continued to try to make sense of my own life through writing, I started looking at Hersl more closely. I didn't think he was a victim-I wasn't a victim either-but I did start to think more about the failed drug war and the reasons why we both played a game that cost him his freedom, and could've cost me mine. I've always said that people needed to understand my environment before judging my past as a dope dealer. Didn't I owe the same thing to him?\n\nBack in 2001, when the best basketball games in Baltimore still took place on the jagged, stained blacktops of city parks and project courtyards, you could catch us at one of three playgrounds.\n\nWe balled for clout over at Patterson Park, balled for money at Bocek's, and we always, always ended our nights at Ellwood, the only court that had lights. It wasn't strange to see 20 or 30 people by the gates after the sun dipped and faded, running whole court games to 16, by 1's. Everybody loud, everybody the best and, when they lost, the blame normally went on everybody else. I'd normally be in the mix, but I'm thinking of one night when I could only spectate because I was nursing a slight ankle injury.\n\nStill, I stood there beside the court, running my mouth and clowning anybody who touched the basketball. \"Yoooo! You a bum, you can't shoot!\"\n\nCop cars rolled up and down Jefferson Street and past North Ellwood all the time so we didn't pay attention to them-honestly, if you played ball, and only played, police officers circling the court was a no-thought. Unless they rushed.\n\n\"One time yeroooooo! One time!\" someone yelled as a couple of police cars skidded clouds of dust across the top of the hill by the baseball diamond and a mix of plainclothes and uniforms quickly blocked both exits. \"On the ground now!\" they yelled.\n\nI didn't have hooping clothes on because of my injury, so I really wasn't in the mood to lay on the concrete. \"Get on the fuckin' ground!\" they yelled before I reluctantly complied.\n\nThese kinds of searches, where the police jumped out on a crowd of Black men, waving batons and flashlights, clutching pistols and screaming, were beyond unconstitutional and extra-illegal since they had nothing like probable cause. But we didn't really have a choice-if we allowed them to search us and we were dirty, they might only take our goods. But if we were clean and didn't allow them to search us, they might plant something on us anyway.\n\nI can't put a face on every cop who was there that night, but one uni really stood out-he wasn't old, but he wasn't young like us either. He was of medium build but probably a little thicker with his bulletproof or padded shirt on, thinning dark hair cutting across his meaty white head and a mouth that wouldn't stop running.\n\nAs I lay down on the ground, that cop kept talking. I don't remember everything he said, but I recall that he said we were \"nothing.\"\n\n\"I'm better than you,\" I said back.\n\nThat cop's corny police boot said hello to my rib. I tightened my chest, bracing for another blow that never came, and then tilted my head to the side to get a really good look at his face. I focused enough to notice his expression switch from anger to blankness to laughter in a blink. Who was this clown?\n\nWe had nothing for those guys that night, so they trotted back up the hill and I got up and brushed off my clothes. Business as usual.\n\nI didn't know it at the time, but the cop who kicked me was named Daniel T. Hersl. His boot in my ribs would mark the beginning of a 17-year relationship between two guys who had more in common than anyone would have imagined, especially us.\n\nI grew up on North Robinson -the black side of Fayette street. Hersl grew up in Highlandtown, part of the lower-middle-class, so-called hard-working white section of East Baltimore. Only a mile and a big world separated us.\n\nHersl is 10 years my senior, and we attended the same elementary and middle schools (Highlandtown and Hampstead Hill, which I was kicked out of). He went to Patterson High, like some of my older cousins. By 10th grade, truancy police regularly brought Hersl home-school wasn't for him, so his mom allowed him to drop out, providing he got his GED. He played pick-up basketball at the Highlandtown Boys and Girls Club in Patterson Park, just like me.\n\nThe club wasn't particularly Black-friendly when I played ball back there in the early '90s, a decade after Hersl ran the halls. My friends and I never would've even attended the center if it wasn't for a coach named Thurman \"Roe\" Johnson who recruited guys from our side of Orleans Street. \"I need that Black speed,\" he would always say. \"These white boys can't cut it!\"\n\nRoe was the only Black coach at the rec center and he didn't have his own van, so if we missed the last ride home, my friends and I had to walk through Patterson Park, a hangout for skinheads. All of the older dudes had stories about the chain-swinging, prematurely bald, young, white racists with tattered Doc Martens, sleeveless denim, leather gloves with the fingertips cut off and an appetite for conflict, mainly with Black kids, because they couldn't fight men. As a small child, I remember pointing to a lamppost and asking my older cousin Kevin what those little red flags were that I saw everywhere. \"Yo, that's a swat-sticks sign,\" he said, totally fucking up the pronunciation of \"swastika.\" \"You see those, you know it's racist people near.\" I don't think Hersl was one of those skinheads, but in 1999, he found a home with a gang that did far more damage to Black Baltimore than any Nazi ever did.\n\nHersl joined the BPD a year after Kurt Schmoke, the city's first elected Black mayor, announced he would not seek a fourth term. Schmoke was an extremely popular mayor, loved by many in the community and the establishment. He gained fame from introducing progressive ideas like the decriminalization of drugs and a needle exchange program in an effort to fight HIV. But when announcing he would not run, Schmoke went on record saying he didn't have any fresh ideas to address the 300-plus annual murder rate-a problem we still have, with a record-breaking 348 murders in 2019. (He is now the president of the University of Baltimore, where I work.) Schmoke's exit cleared the path for a young, ambitious white city councilman named Martin O'Malley-who soared to the top of his 16 Democratic opponents with a plan for zero tolerance and broken windows policing he'd cribbed from New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani.\n\nThe result, according to a 2016 report from the Department of Justice, was \"a massive increase in the quantity of arrests-but a corresponding decline in quality.\" O'Malley's zero tolerance policy increased the number of stop-and-frisk searches and discretionary arrests for pointless crimes like loitering and disturbing the peace. Anybody and everybody around us was going to jail for anything and everything. Walking down the street while making eye contact with a cop, riding a bike on the sidewalk, having an open container-you name it, somebody got booked for it.\n\nA disproportionate number of African Americans were mistreated, overpoliced and imprisoned. And it worked. O'Malley rode those \"tough on crime\" stats from the mayor's office to the governor's mansion. That's the climate that Hersl, who joined the force in 1999, learned to police in.\n\nLike him, I succumbed, a couple of years later, and volunteered to play my part in the war. On the other side.\n\nBefore 2001, I'd flirted with the drug game. I knew the dealers, corner stragglers, nickel shavers and block bosses all the way to the dudes who were juggling enough weight to sedate small towns. These were all people who hung in and around the neighborhood, my house even. I tried my hand, made a few transactions, but wasn't committed because I never wanted to cop out to being just another dope dealer. It wasn't a moral thing, really, I just looked in the mirror and saw a computer engineer or a lawyer staring back, not a criminal. But by the end of 2001, like many people in my age group and from my block, I sat stiff at the end of an IKEA two-chair kitchen table set, putting packages of $3, $6, $10, $20 and $50 blast together.\n\nMy best friend-who I'll call Nick to protect his family and children-worked with me, but he couldn't get the crack in the vial as quick as I could because his fingers were too fat, he talked too much and dude had a serious problem focusing. Really, nobody around me during that particular time could cap as fast. I was in a rush to get to the money, but patient enough to follow the necessary steps.\n\n\"We the next millionaires comin' out of Baldamore, Dee!\" Nick would yell, flopping his truck-wide frame all over the room, bouncing off of the damaged drywall, constantly knocking dishes off table edges with his huge ass. \"Look at all dis work!\"\n\nWe had some quick success down on Curley Street with a product we branded as \"Yeah Buddy.\" The cash poured in with steady traffic on a block that no one really paid attention to. Our little drug shop ran from about 4 p.m.  to 8 p.m. Peace is held when you split up times-some other guys hustled during the same shift as us, but they were heroin dealers. We sold crack, so our clientele was completely different. The only other crack guys came out around 10 p.m., older dudes who had day jobs or something. Everything was smooth until I found out some of them were calling their crack Yeah Buddy, pretending to be us.\n\n\"It's mainly Clarence,\" Nick said, looking at his reflection in a chrome pistol. \"We handle him, the problem over.\"\n\nI honestly didn't care if Clarence and the rest of those dudes made a couple of dollars off of the Yeah Buddy name. But the streets don't work like that-if one person ripped you off on Monday, you'd wake up to a million lined up to get you on Tuesday. It's probably the same way the cops feel when they patrol together and run up on dudes like us.\n\nI tucked my pistol in my dip and hopped shotgun in Nick's car. A wooden bat rested in the back seat, not an official baseball bat, but the mini-slugger they give you as a gift for attending Orioles home games. We drove down to Curley, just in time to see Clarence closing down his shop.\n\n\"Yo, Clarence!\" I said. \"You still selling Yeah Buddy?\"\n\n\"Fresh out, youngin',\" he replied. \"What the fuck y'all want?\"\n\nI was going to tell him that he couldn't sell it no more, and I was going to follow with a threat and some shit talk and maybe a joke because I wasn't really trying to beef with him. But then Nick swung the bat, cracking Clarence in the side of his head.\n\nI stopped the third blow and kneeled down next to Clarence.\n\n\"We not asking you no more,\" I said.\n\nClarence got up holding his head. Nick cracked him again-and this time the bat broke.\n\nThe whole Clarence situation was a boost to our reputations. Everyone ran around telling the story of how Nick and I cracked Clarence's head in half like a sunflower seed over some money. But that rep also had a downside. Working people in that neighborhood had known that Nick and I dibbled and dabbled, but we weren't looked at as violent drug dealers until that incident. We had traded the love we earned from being goofy, fun kids for the same type of fear cops like Hersl used on the streets.\n\nLike those police, we now had zero allies, and that's why Curley Street dried up-people started calling the cops, little fights started breaking out and the whole thing just became a mess. Nick and I built a small crew and set up shop a few minutes away on Madeira Street. There were no drug crews when we built the spot, but we still ended up catching static from this kid named Dress-Code.\n\nWe caught Dress-Code one night after taking the women we were dating to an R&B concert in D.C. He was on the corner sharing jokes with his crew, a little drunk. I told my date to pull the car over, reached in the glove box and pulled out my pistol.\n\n\"Dress, what's up, man?\" I said, getting out.\n\nHe said he was looking for me, before landing a hard right across my jawline, hard enough for me to feel my teeth rattle. It dazed me and I gathered myself, squaring up and dipping my chin. Nick got out of the car and sparked a blunt. Dress-Code charged at me, I grabbed his shoulders and used the momentum to sling him to the ground-his fist or elbow hit my lip again, it burst, I felt blood and spit welling up in my mouth.\n\nWe're not kidding. You should subscribe.\n\nAfter a pretty even fight, I got the upper hand. I pulled the gun out and slapped Dress across the face with it. He hit the ground, barely catching himself. I stood over him, placing both of my knees on his arm, and used the butt of the gun to beat some teeth out of his mouth. I beat him until his blood covered my shirt, until our blood mixed, until he was unconscious, until Nick pulled me off of him like, \"Chill, D Watk, you gonna kill him!\"\n\nLooking back, it was probably in that moment that I was closest to Hersl. We were both defining our territory-drawing our lines in blood and being rewarded for it. Nick and I locked down Madeira Street for a while; however, our time there didn't last long because of another cop, who worked with Hersl. \"I know exactly who you are, Lil Dwight!\" he said once, after slamming me against a wall and then his car.\n\n\"I don't know you, man-wrong guy,\" I said, turning my face away. He dug in my pocket, pulled out a couple of dollars, kept them, kicked me up my ass and told me to be on my way.\n\n\"Nick, we gotta get off this block, it's too hot,\" I warned.\n\n\"You worry too much, D. We good.\"\n\nWe weren't. By 2004, Hersl was 34 years old and had been moved into working with some plainclothes units. The plainclothes cops, who are also called knockers and jump-out boys, were all about \"proactive policing\" and stats-how many people you can throw in jail. The Maryland Judiciary Case Search shows that Hersl alone made hundreds of arrests in 2002. The next year, BPD made more than 100,000 arrests-that's roughly one-sixth of the population and a staggering 274 arrests a day.\n\nThey were patting everybody down, even the women, pocketing what they found and throwing the n-word around like it was our official title. I never carried large amounts of cash-doing so was like begging to be robbed by cops or stick-up kids-but Hersl and cops like him definitely got a few come-ups of $100 to $400 off me.\n\nHersl and a partner once clipped me for a few dollars at a bar called High Hats, probably one of the few lounges in America where customers actually have to bring their drink of choice to the establishment. We young dudes drank Belvedere, Rémy and Hennessey, but High Hats only had Ripple, Old Grand-Dad 100 and other brands that the elderly enjoyed. So we grabbed the bottles from cut-rates and left them at the bar with our names attached.\n\nSome of us young hustlers would chill there before going to work our blocks, and others would wind down with a sip after our shift. I was pregaming for a date when Hersl and another cop came in the bar, shouting the routine even though we already knew it, making all of us exit through the side door. Against the side of the building, we assumed the position: facing the wall with our hands pressed against it, legs spread and, of course, our pockets open. Hersl and his buddy patted all of our pockets, tipping themselves with whatever they found. I didn't have a lot of cash on me, $200 or $300 at most. I was upset, but not too upset because I sold drugs and paying cops like Hersl was just a tax. In those years, the cops were so fucked up, and they rolled us so much, that I didn't think that much about being robbed by a person who gets paid to protect people. A normal person would be scared, terrorized even, but because this was all part of the game we were playing, it hardly left an impression on me. Now it's hard to separate it from all the other times I'd been held up. When the cops finished being crooks, we went back inside and finished drinking.\n\nBut I remember another time, when Hersl caught me at CC's carryout with a small amount of weed. I was walking out of the store with my chicken box and a half-and-half, just in time for Hersl to line me up against the wall with the rest of the people hanging out in front of the store. He took my grass and my cash and let me go, which was cool because those dudes were locking people up for anything.\n\nEverything I had going against me he had going for him. Us young Black dudes who were slanging were hated, hunted and haunted for our role in the drug war. He was praised and honored and rewarded with overtime. Eventually I got tired of dealing, jaded even, and after a few of my friends were arrested and or murdered, I quit. Nick begged me to return, but I was done.\n\nOur neighborhood and our industry were crumbling under the weight of the drug war, and so was Nick. He had a serious pill problem, popping Oxys like Tic Tacs. Everyone knew the pills were eating at him, but it still hurt when he developed a heroin addiction. Then he pulled a gun on me.\n\nI didn't flinch as he squeezed the trigger, but shut my eyes as the hammer clicked. It clicked. He said, \"Bow!\" I opened my eyes, and it clicked again. He looked down the same barrel, said, \"Well, damn,\" put it in his dip and bumped my shoulder as he walked past me. The gun was empty. At this stage of his addiction, his swollen-bloated caramel cheeks that used to wobble when he laughed at his own jokes had completely evaporated until you could see the shape of his jaw bone. I probably could've taken the gun and beat welts onto his head, but I let him go. I started staying away from the block he was stuck to. In 2006, he was gunned down by some dudes he was robbing with and eventually stole from.\n\nIn 2007, I enrolled in the University of Baltimore-a college in the middle of the city that was known for catering to older students and helping its graduates find jobs, exactly what I needed. I was a street guy and didn't really know what to major in. I guess my background was business, but classes on that seemed boring. So I took the basics and decided to figure it out. I spent the rest of my time wandering around the city looking for a job. I had no real connections or traditional work experience-just a bunch of time and the will to submit 20-plus applications a week. Now that I was out of the game, I wasn't even really talking to my friends who were still dealing. I forgot about Hersl. But he didn't quit.\n\nThe same year I started college, a judge remarked on the 46 complaints that Hersl and his partner had racked up between them. Even though they'd each only had one of those complaints sustained, the judge noted the prevalence of the pattern. \"Misconduct, sometimes when it's frequent enough, it indicates a lack of desire to tell the truth,\" the judge said.\n\nIn May 2007, Hersl and another notorious cop-who was also an MMA fighter-spotted a 50-year-old cafeteria worker named Lillian Parker selling raffle tickets. Hersl asked her what she was doing, and she said she was waiting for a friend to come pick up her ticket. They charged her with selling drugs. She spent two days in jail, but prosecutors dropped the charges against her. When she sued the city, they settled the case for $100,000.\n\nThree months later, Hersl and his sergeant stopped several women in the Joy Garden CarryOut restaurant and tried to search them. When one of the women got smart with them, Hersl reacted violently, as he had with me. In a deposition, the woman said the cops broke her arm. \"He punched me in the arm,\" she said. She heard a loud pop and fell onto the floor. The city settled the lawsuit for $50,000.\n\nA few years later, a guy named Charles Faulkner said he fled from Hersl, who then broke Faulkner's jaw and nose with his fists and a police radio. He sued Hersl; the city settled the lawsuit for $49,000. At this point, Hersl had already cost the city close to a quarter of a million dollars in settlements.\n\nThat was around the same time that I really fell in love with reading and began to make sense of the world around me through critical thinking. It was also when I started to develop an understanding about how Baltimore works. In 2011, I felt like I might be able to change that narrative, as the first dude on my block and in my family to graduate from college. I hustled up tickets from every student I knew so that I could have my own mini-cheering section in the auditorium when I walked the stage.\n\nIn October of that year, Hersl also walked across the stage in the BPD auditorium and received the Medal of Honor for some shit that went down at 25th Street and Harford Road. Hersl and his partners saw a dude riding a bike in a leather jacket, and when they rolled up on him, he shot one of the partners in the neck. According to the cops, Hersl jumped up on the car and shot the man, Gerry Gough, who later got sentenced to life in prison. Hersl was a hero.\n\nAfter those accolades, it seems like we both hit a hard stretch. In 2013, I was in grad school at Johns Hopkins University School of Education, sitting in the back, watching aspiring teachers from as far away as Korea discuss strategies on teaching Black kids like me from Baltimore. I was the only Black kid from Baltimore in the class. Some people feel empowered by being \"the only Black guy,\" but it depressed me. I thought about guys I had to bury while I was in college, guys like Dip, Ro Ro, Free, Light Skin Kelly and especially Nick, who were just as smart as me, if not smarter. They should have been in these classes with me, not dead.\n\nHersl was dealing with the pain death carries as well. That year, his brother Matthew Hersl, 45, a city employee and lover of the Orioles, was standing in front of City Hall when he was struck by an out-of-control Acura that was being chased by a cop. Danny and Matt were a lot younger than their older siblings. They hung out and went to ball games together, where Matt was a regular and chased after fly balls. Hersl took that death extremely hard.\n\nIn 2014, our worlds came together again. I had graduated from Hopkins and was taking night classes to earn my MFA at the University of Baltimore. During the day, I worked as a substitute and then a resource teacher at Friendship Academy of Engineering and Technology, where one of my students introduced me to Young Moose.\n\nYoung Moose, whose legal name is Kevron Evans, was a rapper from my neighborhood.  My students bumped his music religiously. It excited me that he referenced the same blocks and neighborhoods that Nick and I used to run. Most rappers from the city kind of pretended to be from New York, but Moose was all Baltimore, all day. I downloaded his tape \"O.T.M. 2\" (Out The Mud) and fell in love with the music, especially \"F**k Da Police\" where he called out Hersl's corruption during the intro: \"Muthafuckin' whores man! Yeah nigga fuck the police-Lil Head, Mike Fries, Hersl ... I want all you bitches to die. They keep fuckin' with us, they keep on harassin'!\" He went even harder on \"Tired\" from his 2015 mixtape, \"O.T.M 3,\" saying, \"Detective Hersl, he a bitch, I swear to God he ain't right. Heard about my rap career, he tryin' to fuck up my life.\"\n\nI became interested in writing about Moose almost immediately after hearing his music, and even more after I heard the Hersl connection. I remembered what Hersl thought about people like me: \"nothing.\" I could still hear the word from our first encounter. However much we hated him, it seemed, he hated us more. After reaching out to Moose's girlfriend, who was a student at Coppin State University where I was now an adjunct professor, we started talking.\n\nIn 2014, Hersl used Moose's lyrics and the video from his song \"Posted\" as a piece of the evidence to get a search warrant to raid his house, writing that he had been \"advised by numerous police officers that Kevron Evans has numerous rap music videos\" on YouTube in which , Hersl claimed, he observed Moose and his associates \"in possession of multiple firearms.\"\n\nHersl locked up Moose's whole family: his mom, his dad and his two brothers. But Moose wasn't home. In his bail review, Moose's lawyer claimed Hersl told the rest of the family that he was aware  Moose was scheduled to perform with underground rap legend Boosie Badazz and that \"he would make sure that Kevron did not have any chance to perform at that concert.\" The show could have been career-changing for Moose, but instead he was sitting in a cell. Hersl made $111,271.73, almost half of which came in overtime, that year.\n\nYoung Moose's lyrics landed because his experience was so common. And now that cellphone videos had begun to capture police abuse in the Black community, white people were finally paying attention. On April 12, 2015, Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old unarmed Black man, was chilling with his friends in West Baltimore when he was harassed, chased and arrested for having a knife that is sold in corner stores and gas stations all over the city. Gray was killed by the negligence of Baltimore police officers, who threw him into the van headfirst. He sustained a neck injury. If they had taken him to the hospital when he asked, he could still be alive; even if they had just followed their own protocol, he could still be alive. But they didn't.\n\nWe all knew that could have easily happened to me, to Young Moose or to any other young Black man in Baltimore. Suddenly, people were interested in hearing about our experiences, while Hersl, who was filmed showering protesters with pepper spray and pulling a reporter to the ground, became one of the most prominent faces of police violence. Hersl's colleagues have said they noticed his spirits were low after that. Like a lot of cops used to ruling the city, he felt betrayed by the police command that told them to stand down as the CVS burned. Shortly afterward, Hersl was transferred out of the Eastern District and into the Gun Trace Task Force-a group of so-called elite plainclothes cops responsible for getting weapons off the streets and targeting the community's most violent criminals. The gang, led by Wayne Jenkins, included Hersl, Evodio Hendrix, Maurice Ward, Marcus Taylor, Jemell Rayam and Momodu Gondo. Later, two more Baltimore police sergeants, a detective and an officer in Philadelphia pleaded guilty to related charges.\n\nBut just so you don't think this is a story about how we are finally getting justice in America, it's important to say that the feds never would have done anything about Hersl if they hadn't been targeting the GTTF's Detective Momodu Gondo, a Black guy from Northeast Baltimore who they suspected was working with a drug crew.\n\nAntonio Shropshire and Glen Kyle Wells, a lifelong friend of Gondo's, weren't selling crack like I had. Things had moved to heroin, and they were selling dope out of the Alameda Shopping Center to white users from a nearby county. When white kids started overdosing, law enforcement got interested and traced the drugs back to Baltimore. After they got a wiretap on Shropshire's phone, they heard him call Gondo for advice in March 2016 and tapped Gondo's phone as well. Almost immediately, the cops realized it wasn't just that Gondo was working with dealers-the cops were robbing suspects daily.\n\nAll of that got worse in June 2016, when Jenkins, another rowdy white boy, took over the squad. Jenkins, a sergeant, was an ambitious criminal mastermind who later admitted that he had robbed more than $100,000 from one dealer shortly before taking over the squad. Hersl didn't have that kind of ambition, but he had known Jenkins for a long time-in 2008, a suspect claimed in court that Jenkins and Hersl crashed into his car, broke his window with a pistol and pulled him out through the broken glass. The judge did not believe him.\n\nThe GTTF was robbing, stealing and dealing. They were also getting roughly a gun a night, earning tons of overtime, and garnering all sorts of praise. In October 2016, the police department newsletter praised the work of the GTTF, which is funny because the feds later showed that during that whole month, Hersl hardly showed up for work and spent his time working on his house while charging the department overtime.\n\nIn January 2017, Hersl and Jenkins took a young cop named James Kostoplis on a ride and asked what he thought about stealing money from big drug dealers. \"That's a fucking terrible idea,\" said Kostoplis, who they called K-Stop. He failed the test and was transferred.\n\nHersl got a transfer, too. His family says he'd been trying to get out of the GTTF for a long time and that he finally got a post in the Citywide Shooting Unit a few weeks before everything fell apart.\n\nOn March 1, 2017, Daniel Hersl went to a meeting at the headquarters of the Internal Affairs Division. When he got off the elevator, he was arrested by FBI agents and charged under the RICO Act, which had been created to bring down mobsters.\n\nReading about Hersl's indictment on my Twitter feed was transformative. I started texting all of my friends with Hersl stories and joking with Moose's manager on the phone. I'd learned from the Freddie Gray incident just how difficult it was to convict cops, but this was still a moment. Arguably the most hated cop in Baltimore was going down, and I lived to see it.\n\nHersl was one of two GTTF members to plead not guilty, even though he was facing more than 20 years in prison. He had long ago lost the dark hair he had when we first met, and when he sat at the defense table, the court lights bounced off of his gleaming head. His equally bald lawyer, William Purpura, had also represented El Chapo. Hersl's defense was brilliant and hilarious. Purpura argued that Hersl may have stolen but he did not rob, because, as a cop, Hersl had a right to take the money from people and just failed to return it.\n\nHersl's family, all looking just like him, came in every day with a cooler for their lunch. One of the prosecutors played a tape from a bug they had in Gondo's car. This one night in August 2016, GTTF was chasing a dude through downtown, and he crashed into another driver when he ran a red light. This was right by the hospital, but instead of getting help, the cops sat there and worried about getting caught. \"These car chases, it's a crapshoot, you know,\" Hersl's recorded voice said. He actually laughed. Cold-blooded, especially knowing that his brother died in the same way.\n\nSteve Hersl had stood in front of the TV cameras, wailing and crying when Matt Hersl died. In 2018, when the jury convicted Daniel Hersl of robbery and racketeering, Steve did the same thing. \"Let's talk about the corruption on top. Everybody starts from the bottom, the little guy,\" he said, weeping outside the courthouse. \"My brother Danny Hersl wasn't part of this gang.\"\n\nThat second part was bullshit. But Steve wasn't lying when he talked about corruption up top. Detective Sean Suiter had been killed the day before he was supposed to testify to the grand jury about the GTTF. His death has been the source of much controversy, with an official review board calling it a suicide and the medical examiner ruling it a homicide. Then Deputy Commissioner Dean Palmere resigned in the middle of the trial, after Gondo testified that Palmere had helped cover up a fatal police shooting-Palmere said he'd been planning his retirement for some time and that the announcement was unrelated. Apparently, he had some beef with the new commissioner, Darryl De Sousa, who was later sentenced to almost a year in prison for failing to file individual federal tax returns. This past November, Catherine Pugh, who was the mayor at the time of the trial, was indicted on 11 federal charges related to a children's book scam that netted her nearly a million bucks. She caught just three years with the feds.\n\nSo, Steve Hersl had some kind of point. Like me when I was on the streets, Daniel Hersl was part of a larger culture. Steve seemed kind of unhinged, but I thought I should try to talk to Hersl's family, so I got in touch with his brother Jerome.\n\nI instantly recognized Jerome Hersl because he looks like an older version of Danny-the way Danny will probably look after his first 10 years in prison. He asked if we could meet at the University of Maryland downtown, which isn't too far from the University of Baltimore, where I teach. He brought his wife, and the three of us shuffled into a quiet conference room. I wanted to talk about his brother, but he wanted to wait for a professor who he said would be joining us. \"She's an African American woman, and is aware of the work I'm doing in Harford County,\" he said. He opened a folder and handed me a collection of pamphlets he'd published, titled \"African-American History of Harford County, Maryland. A Weekly Publication.\"\n\n\"You do these every week?\" I asked.\n\n\"We were,\" he replied. \"But it became a lot to handle, so now I publish biweekly or monthly.\"\n\nJerome explained that the Black people of Harford County would take more pride in their community if they knew how their people contributed to its history. He was so passionate that he went on about it for almost two hours.\n\nJerome had a clear mission in elevating Blackness in a weird, unintentionally racist way. Who is he to say that Black people who commit crimes-or in general-don't take pride in Harford County? Most people, Black or white or whatever, commit crimes or damage property because they are poor. His pamphlets could not cure the ills of systemic poverty.\n\nBut even so, I was sort of impressed. It was bizarre that Danny Hersl, a person who I envisioned as super racist, had a brother with such an interest in Black history.\n\nHe assured me that Daniel was not a racist.\nI pretty much knew the professor wasn't showing up, so we had to get to business. Jerome said he didn't want to talk about the case because he believed his brother was innocent and his appeal was still pending, but he told me some things about Danny's childhood. How he was a rough kid but had a good heart and how he was a great athlete and dreamed of making it as a professional baseball player. I laughed because it sounded like my childhood bio. And, like me, Hersl started having run-ins with the law early on.\n\nJerome couldn't help but giggle when he told the story of how Danny tore the butt of his jeans out while running from the cops as a teenager. And how he was proud when Danny got his head on straight, earned his GED and got a job at Northern High as a school police. Danny made the family even prouder when he graduated from police academy. Jerome became emotional, pounding his hand into his fist and pausing for breath when he told the story of how Danny saved his partner's life and was honored by the department. The unexpected death of their brother Matt tore Danny to pieces, Jerome said, but he dealt with the pain by becoming a better father and officer.\n\n\"He was grouped in with the Gun Trace Task Force, but he wasn't one of those guys,\" Jerome said.\n\n\"But he stole money!\" I interrupted.\n\nJerome's wife, who had been sitting there silently, started shaking her head.\n\n\"That's all hearsay,\" Jerome said.\n\nI asked him about the case of April Sims . Hersl, along with detectives Gondo and Jenkins, went into her house because they thought she had tens of thousands of dollars there. Jenkins laid out the plan for entering her unit and stealing the cash. According to Gondo's testimony, Hersl replied, \"I can use the money. I'm in the process of buying a house.\"\n\nThere wasn't any cash in the condo, but Hersl was convicted of stealing designer handbags he gave to Gondo.\n\n\"I don't think that is true,\" Jerome replied. \"Gondo saying it doesn't make it true.\"\n\nHe repeated that if his brother had done anything wrong, or got caught on tape participating in a crime, it was because Jenkins had made him do it.\n\nI leaned in, looked Jerome in the eye and told him that his brother had stolen from me, personally, before he got with Jenkins.\n\n\"I never got too upset because he probably could've taken me to prison,\" I told Jerome. \"But he didn't.\"\nJerome maintained his position, saying he believed his brother was 100 percent innocent.\n\n\"So, all these people, including me, are lying?\" I asked.\n\n\"The sad truth is that Hersl had to grow up without his dad, and now his son may have to do the same,\" Jerome said.\n\nThat was a bullshit deflection, but as I left, I thought about what he said. I had a great relationship with my father and still ended up in the streets, because he wasn't my only influence. Many people attribute most of my past to the culture I was raised in. Like Hersl, I lost a brother. I lost a best friend, and plenty of other people as well. Those deaths sent me crazy, but ultimately didn't make me into a criminal-my greed did.\n\nOn one of the federal wiretaps, Gondo can be heard talking with Jemell Rayam, a GTTF co-conspirator, about getting someone to sign their overtime slips. \"Dan probably at the bar, yo,\" Gondo says.\n\nI'd been wondering about the other influences on Hersl's life, so I figured I'd better go to the bar, too. I spent the next several weeks crossing over to the other side of Patterson Park and into the world that made Danny Hersl.\nOn the first night, I rolled up there with one of my white friends. He's a reporter who has covered Baltimore for a long time and has extensive knowledge of GTTF. Angle Inn is in more of a lower- to middle-class white area, so I figured a Black guy with a white friend might make the locals more comfortable.\n\nIt's a nice-looking bar-TVs on the wall, dartboards and a cool outdoor area in the rear. We sat at the end of the bar. I ordered whiskey, he ordered a beer, and we both got steamed shrimp and codfish cakes. There were about 10 people lingering around the bar-all white, and they all appeared to be regulars. They seemed pretty cliqued up, so I didn't bother talking to them. I just ate my shrimp and plotted on my next visit.\n\nThe bartender told me they only had happy hour on Fridays, so I pulled up the following Friday and took my same seat. This time, it was crowded-the patrons were looser and it was easier for me to spark conversations. I made a point to not bring up police or politics-just the Ravens, the O's and how drunk I was. I wasn't really that drunk, but the guys around the bar were really into exclaiming, \"I'm so hammered, man! I'm tanked!\" So I just joined in.\n\nSoon, I was used to these bars and I started asking around about Hersl.\n\n\"Aye, you guys know Danny Hersl?\" I asked a group of three white guys. \"You know, the cop?\"\n\nOne of the guys got up and left. The other, who had a deep red tan, said, \"I miss that asshole!\" He told me they'd often bumped heads-and about the time they had gotten into a fight with each other when they went to Ocean City with a bunch of other Highlandtown guys.\n\nBut, he said, later the same night when some Delaware dudes came for them, Danny was there for him. \"Of all the Baltimore dudes who knew me in that place, Danny was the only one who had my back. Even though we were mad at each other, we kicked those guys' asses,\" he said.\n\n\"My whole section of East Baltimore always just saw him as a racist cop,\" I said.\n\nThe tan dude, who didn't want to be named in a story, laughed and said Danny was a whole lot of things, but he didn't have a racist bone in his body. \"He was extra friendly to this little cute Black stripper over at the Ritz!\" he said. \"That's where we need to be!\"\n\n\"Pressing down on a Black stripper doesn't mean you not a racist. It means you are horny,\" I pointed out.\n\n\"Look at the crew he went down with, they were all Black except the boss, plenty of Black guys come through the neighborhood and they were all his friends. They are all our friends,\" he said. \"Danny's a firecracker. He's a follower. Danny isn't the smartest. He's loyal, which probably got him into trouble. But he's no racist. If he racist, then I'm racist!\"\n\nI'd never voluntarily sat down with a cop before. But I thought Larry Smith Jr., a former Internal Affairs detective, might be able to help me understand how Hersl got away with it for so long or what it was about police culture that made him who he was. Like me, Smith had gotten out of the game and was trying to make a living as a writer.\n\nWe met at a nice cafe in Southeast Baltimore, not too far away from where Smith had once patrolled. Smith had a neatly shaved salt-and-pepper beard and a gray sports coat coupled with boot-cut jeans that evenly blanketed his shoes. Real clean and polished-he didn't look like a former cop, I guess in the same way people say I don't look like I teach at a university.\n\nLike Hersl, Smith became an officer in 1999. \"Making the transition from civilian to cop was overwhelming,\" Smith told me. \"I wasn't accustomed to exerting any type of authority,\" he wrote in an article published on Medium, \"and now, after six short months, I was given the power to take away someone's freedom and the instruments to take someone's life.\"\n\nSmith explained the culture of the department to me. \"Cops were being praised and rewarded for making 30 arrests in a month, but no one was talking about how half of those arrests were for things like public urinating,\" he said.\n\nHe didn't break the rules like Hersl did-but he still didn't feel like what he was doing, what the rules told him to do, was right.\n\nIn 2013, there was an opening for a detective in the Internal Affairs Division, and Smith thought having the power to punish crooked cops could be way more honorable than arresting people for nuisance crimes on the street. The system was screwed up; in IAD, he thought, he might be able to change that. He was wrong.\n\n\"Internal Affairs is just cops investigating cops,\" Smith said. \"That's the reason why nothing gets done.\"\n\nHe said they needed a whole separate unit to deal with complaints against Hersl, but the investigations were rarely taken seriously. If IAD detectives weren't friends with the cops they investigated, they were bullied and intimidated by them and had almost no power. If he felt omnipotent when dealing with the public, he felt powerless when it came to other cops.\n\nAfter years on the job, Smith couldn't take it anymore. He suffered from PTSD, and he told me he'd tried to kill himself and felt abandoned by the department. \"The 18 years of murders, shootings and whatever you can think of has affected me,\" he said. In his eyes, I could see the same thing I saw in the eyes of friends like Nick who had stayed in the game too long-except Smith made it out of the drug war and Nick didn't.\n\nSmith was one of the nicest guys I ever met. He knew I wanted to question him for my story when I invited him to dinner, but he still offered to pay-even though he was unemployed at the time. He now works in retail management and writes.\n\nLike Hersl, he had once been a cop who prided himself on arresting as many people as possible. If Smith could grow and see the mistake of ruining people's lives to bring in small stats and overtime, then doesn't he deserve to be judged on that growth?\n\nI can say the same for Hersl and myself. We are all products of the culture we lived in, but we still have the ability to make choices.\n\nI had no interest in selling drugs until the opportunity intertwined with my need for money. But I learned from my mistakes and I work at being a better person. Even though Larry Smith didn't steal, police culture made him lock up people to maintain petty stats-and when he recognized that he was wrong, he stopped. Hersl was also a product of the climate he learned to police in, but he coupled it with greed, and now his young son is growing up without a father.\n\nAt his sentencing, Hersl's lawyers read some of the letters he wrote to his son and other members of his family. \"Hi, little boy. I hope you're doing well and being a good boy for Mommy,\" he wrote in one letter. \"I also hope your summer vacation is going good. I bet you like sleeping in and going to bed late.\"\n\nBut to the rest of his family, he wasn't so cheerful. \"I finally got to go outside yesterday for the first time in over two months,\" Hersl wrote to his family when he was put on lockdown. \"I have to admit that I actually had tears in my eyes as I walked around the yard for the whole hour I was allowed to stay out.\"\n\nI don't feel sorry for Daniel Hersl. He separated scores of fathers from their sons, ruined families and sucked up overtime money from a city that can't even keep its schools heated. But my lack of sympathy doesn't come from a place of bitterness. I didn't expect him to feel sorry for me when he kicked my ribs or took my money, and I wouldn't expect him to feel sorry for me if I'd been gunned down in the streets during my hustling days, or even now as I try to pull kids off the corner. Aside from race, as far as I can tell, the difference between us two all-American East Baltimore boys is that I know I did some pretty bad things, realized it before I got caught and now spend my days trying to make it right, and he didn't.\n\nIn November, Hersl lost his appeal. He still refuses to accept responsibility and continues writing letters and proclaiming his innocence. If he doesn't get it by now, then part of me thinks he never will. I even wrote Hersl a letter, asking for his side of the story and offering him a chance to explain why he robbed me and other people and why he is still trying to deny his role in the crimes he was convicted for. He didn't respond.\n\nIf you ask why I changed and why he didn't, the answer lies in the nature of the system. On my side, we were constantly reminded that we would either end up dead or in jail-society's Black boy mantra. Many of us hustled because we lacked options, but we knew it was a bad choice, even though, at times, we loved it.\n\nFor Hersl, I imagine it was different. He chose a profession that allowed him to be praised, defended and protected. He carried with him all of the power of the state. And when he fucked up, the state had his back, to the point where it bent the law to cover for him. The laws were on his side. Many of the citizens, judges and prosecutors who allowed him to function were on his side. I was seen as a superpredator while he got to be a superhero.\n\nIt's not at all remarkable that Hersl didn't change, because he never had to be held accountable. America didn't give me any tools to change, and it didn't give Daniel Hersl any reason to change. But instead of addressing these problems, it treats us both as exceptions, rewarding me and locking him away, so that it can forget about these particular East Baltimore boys and let the game go on.\n\nMike wanted to protect a co-worker from harassment. He didn't expect his own life to be destroyed in the process.\n\nGaming the lottery seemed as good a retirement plan as any.\n\nBrock Turner's twisted legacy and Michele Dauber's relentless pursuit of justice.\n\nWeâre trying to eliminate sweatshops and child labor by buying right. But thatâs not how the world works."

      "text": "Dem Lawmakers Speak Out Against Cop City Arrests\n\nReporter\n\nSeveral Democrat lawmakers spoke out on the arrests of people connected to the Stop Cop City movement on Sunday, the day before the Atlanta City Council is set to vote on a controversial public safety training facility.\n\nThe three arrested individuals, board members of the Atlanta Solidarity Fund, an organization that supports activists who are arrested, were charged with money laundering and charity fraud . During their arrests on Wednesday, they were faced with helicopters and a SWAT team.\n\nAt the time , state Rep. Saira Draper called the arrests \"grossly excessive\" and said, \"weaponizing the powers of the state for political gain is abuse of power.\"\n\nOrganizers have told HuffPost on multiple occasions over the past few months that the state is using political persecution to intimidate opponents of the Atlanta Public Safety Training Center, also known as Cop City. The facility would train law enforcement and firefighters and is set to be at least 85 acres large in the South River Forest.\n\nA diverse movement of organizers and community members have condemned the center for a variety of reasons - including claims that the facility will lead to harm Black and Brown people, that the money would be better spent on community resources, and that the forest is vital land.\n\nSince Wednesday, Georgia's U.S. Sens. Rev. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, and Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.) have spoken out following the board members' arrests and ahead of a Monday city council meeting.\n\nWarnock said he's concerned about the arrest of three board members.\n\n\"These tactics, coupled with the limited public information provided so far, can have a chilling effect on nonviolent, constitutionally-protected free speech activities those of us in the fight for justice have been engaged in for years,\" he wrote.\n\nWarnock argued that the arrests illustrate the fears and concerns that organizers and community members have voiced on the topic of overpolicing and the militarization of police in Georgia.\n\n🧵: While we still don't have all the details, as a pastor who has long been engaged in justice work, I am concerned by what we know about last Wednesday's show of force against the organizers of an Atlanta bail fund, & the questions it raises. (1/10)\n\nOssoff's statement was much shorter than Warnock's. He mentioned that there has been an \"extremist\" minority that has engaged in violence.\n\n\"It is imperative that the response of government to the violent few not intimidate or infringe on the Constitutional rights of those engaged in nonviolent protest and civil disobedience,\" he wrote.\n\n[thread] While protecting public safety, State and local officials must uphold vital Constitutional rights to free speech and peaceful assembly, as well as due process and legal counsel.\n\nBoth Warnock and Ossoff condemned violent protests, as they have previously in a report by Axios , and maintained that they don't know all the details related to the investigation of the ASF members.\n\nMariah Parker, a labor organizer and former Clark County commissioner who uses they/them pronouns, told HuffPost Sunday that statements from Warnock and Ossoff were necessary, but only just a start.\n\n\"I do maintain concerns myself that they are not taking this situation seriously enough given that repression of activists has been long-standing and ongoing, that the facility is planned within their constituency, within their geographic constituency and that this is going to impact their constituents,\" Parker said. \"So I hope that they will take a stronger stance on this issue in the future as what they did today was a good start, but not good enough.\"\n\nThe commentary extended beyond state lines with Bowman also weighing in on the topic on Sunday from New York.\n\n\"What we're seeing in Atlanta is the suppression of the right to organize and the right to free speech,\" Bowman said . \"We cannot let this happen.\"\n\nNone of the lawmakers mentioned the Georgia State Troopers' killing of Manuel Esteban Paez Terán, also known as Tortuguita, in January during a peaceful protest in the forest. Terán's death marked the first time an environmental activist was killed by police in the U.S., according to The Guardian .\n\nSince the start of the movement, over 40 people have been charged with domestic terrorism in relation to the Stop Cop City movement - some of which had attended a music festival. Three more who had been accused of putting out flyers to intimidate an officer were charged with felonies.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Baton Rouge Cop Points Assault Weapon At HuffPost Reporter, Protesters\n\nBlack Voices Senior Editor, HuffPost\n\nSenior Crime Reporter, HuffPost\n\nTensions hit their peak in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, late Saturday night when police officers armed with military equipment tried to clear those gathered for a demonstration from the streets and highway.\n\nOne officer, armed with an assault weapon, deliberately aimed the gun at protesters and journalists, forcing them to retreat. HuffPost senior crime reporter David Lohr was among them.\n\nLohr arrived in Baton Rouge earlier this week to help capture moments from the Black Lives Matter protests that took over the city's streets. He launched a live-stream on the HuffPost Black Voices Facebook page around 11 p.m. that captured some tense moments, including police making several arrests and one protester getting shocked by a stun gun. In one jarring moment, Lohr captured an officer pointing her assault rifle at protesters ― and at him.\n\n\"An officer just pointed a machine gun at me,\" Lohr says in the live-stream. \"I'm not quite sure what that female officer was doing; she pointed an assault rifle at us.\"\n\nWatch the moment around the 4:45 mark:\n\nBaton Rouge protesters were outraged over the officers' actions on Saturday night, including prominent Black Lives Matter activist DeRay Mckesson, who was arrested at the protest during a moment he captured live on Periscope . Prior to his arrest, Mckesson tweeted about the demonstration and described how police were \"provoking protesters.\"\n\nOther demonstrators sent similar messages.\n\n\"They're trying to kill us. We are peaceful,\" one protester, who didn't give her name, told Lohr in the video. \"They want a reason to shoot us down in the street, but we're not gonna give them one. We're gonna remain peaceful. But we're out here and we're not afraid.\"\n\n\"They want to be able to say we're savages. Never,\" she added. \"We're warriors.\"\n\nHundreds gathered for protests in Baton Rouge, and cities across America , to protest the recent police killings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile ― and declare that black lives matter.\n\nProtesters chanted \"No justice, no peace\" and \"F*ck the police\" as they marched through Baton Rouge, where Sterling was killed days earlier. Officers blocked off roads to prevent marchers from going down the highway and forcefully arrested those who failed to move.\n\n\"One thing I noticed today as opposed to yesterday is that [cops] were certainly more willing to pull their firearms out,\" Lohr observed in the video after things seemed to have calmed down a bit.\n\nLohr, who was warned to \"back up\" and \"move out of the road,\" headed to the Baton Rouge Police Department, where more demonstrators were still gathered. He launched another live-stream on the Black Voices Facebook page to document those moments:\n\nLohr stayed around the area into the early morning to help kids and college students pick up trash at the protest site.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "DOJ's Newark Deal Intended To End Bogus 'Contempt Of Cop' Arrests\n\nSenior Justice Reporter, HuffPost\n\nWASHINGTON -- Newark, New Jersey, residents who record police activity won't have to worry quite as much about being wrongfully arrested under a deal reached with the Justice Department designed to end widespread unconstitutional practices uncovered by a federal probe.\n\nUnder the agreement, the Newark Police Department will train officers that those who \"witness, observe, record, and comment on or complaint about officer conduct\" are engaged in behavior \"secured and protected by the Constitution and laws of the United States.\"\n\nAn investigation into the Newark Police Department released in July 2014 indicated that 75 percent of pedestrian stops made by Newark officers did not have legal basis, that black residents were stopped at a much greater rate than white residents, that officers retaliated against individuals who questioned police actions, and that officers used unreasonable force in more than 1 of 5 cases. The probe even found that Newark officers in the specialized drug and gang units stole property and money from citizens and conducted inadequate investigations into those complaints.\n\nThe findings came just weeks before protests in Ferguson, Missouri, after the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown brought national attention to patterns of unconstitutional policing.\n\nAt the time the Justice Department released its investigation, Newark had settled three lawsuits that resulted from police officers improperly stopping citizens from recording police activity. While a 2011 guidance letter instructed officers not to arrest individuals simply for recording, the investigation found the department didn't adequately explain when an officer had an excuse to arrest someone recording police activity.\n\nThe DOJ deal is intended to help end so-called contempt of cop arrests, when police retaliate against individuals engaged in lawful activity by illegally taking them into custody.\n\nNewark police officers will be banned from taking action unless an individual violates the law, incites others to violate the law, or \"refuses to comply with an officer's order to observe or record from an alternate location and the bystander's presence would jeopardize crime scene integrity or the safety of the officer, the suspect, or others.\"\n\nThe deal will force Newark to \"ensure that officers do not take any police action in retaliation for individuals lawfully exercising their right to witness, observe, record, comment on, or protest police activity. This includes detaining, searching, arresting, issuing a citation, or using force in response to non-criminal statements or other expressive conduct, when the officer would not have taken such action in the absence of the statements or expressive conduct.\"\n\nWhile recording the police is protected activity, police officers don't always treat it that way. In rare cases, illegal arrests of individuals recording police activity have resulted in criminal charges against the officer. A former Connecticut cop was sentenced to prison after he arrested a priest who recorded him and then lied to cover up the unlawful arrest, and a former New York City Police officer was recently indicted for lying about the arrest of an individual who recorded him.\n\nUnder the deal, Newark police will also have to improve their troubled internal affairs system . The consent decree states that the department will conduct regular \"integrity audits\" to identify officers who refuse to accept or discourage the filing of misconduct complaints, or provide false or misleading information about filing complaints.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "MIT Cop Killed In Boston Shootout With Bombing Suspects 'Was Born To Be A Police Officer'\n\nLabor Reporter, HuffPost\n\nSean Collier, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer who was shot and killed during a confrontation with the two Boston Marathon bombing suspects, was a 26-year-old at the start of a law-enforcement career he considered a calling, according to police.\n\nCollier had been with the campus police force for only 14 months when he was found shot near Vasser and Main streets in Cambridge Thursday night at 10:30 p.m., not long after the first reports of gunfire near campus. According to authorities, Collier was taken to Massachusetts General Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.\n\nMIT Police Chief John DiFava praised Collier on Friday as a devoted cop early in a career that he seemed to love.\n\n\"Sean was one of these guys who really looked at police work as a calling,\" DiFava said through the university . \"He was born to be a police officer.\"\n\nFor a campus cop, Collier took a keen interest in student life, even joining the MIT Outing Club, which goes on hiking, skiing and rock climbing jaunts. Collier's Facebook page, which was apparently taken down Friday morning, was full of such photos of the outdoors.\n\n\"In a very short period of time, it was remarkable how engaged he was with students, particularly graduate students,\" DiFava said.\n\nDiFava's portrayal of a young and eager police officer was seconded by Lt. William Rymill of the Somerville Police Department. Before joining the MIT police force in January 2012, Collier, a native of Wilmington, Mass., had worked in the Somerville department's information technology division.\n\nCollier helped develop and maintain the department's website and, judging from YouTube, apparently shot occasional video for the department, like that of an officer's funeral in 2010.\n\nAs a young civilian employee in Somerville, Collier also volunteered his time as an unpaid auxiliary police officer, getting called in to help when the department needed more boots on the ground -- a sure sign of someone devoted to law enforcement who aspired to a badge.\n\nAt MIT, he found that opportunity.\n\n\"He was an all-around great person,\" Rymill said. \"He is going to be greatly, sorely missed.\"\n\nCollier was a graduate of Salem State University, according to a statement posted on the school's Facebook page Friday morning. He'd earned a degree in criminal justice with honors in 2009.\n\nThe school's Facebook page quickly filled up with condolences and praise from Salem State students and graduates, who called their fellow alum a hero who ultimately helped nab one of the bombing suspects.\n\n\"We'll never know how many lives he may have saved. God bless you for your sacrifice,\" one poster wrote.\n\nMIT Executive Vice President and Treasurer Israel Ruiz and Chancellor Eric Grimson posted a message of condolence to Collier on the MIT website on Thursday.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Why Would Anyone Want to Be a Cop?\n\nOwner of Sandy Malone Weddings & Events, Star of TLC's \"Wedding Island,\" author and columnist\n\nPretty soon, police departments nationwide will have to lower their hiring standards, increase salaries and benefits, and put a lot more money into marketing for new hires, because the men and women who would usually be candidates for law enforcement careers will choose another path.\n\nBecoming a police officer used to be a family tradition. It's not just an Irish thing, as is often depicted in movies and on television. I cannot count how many father/son and even mother/daughter, police families you can find out there in various departments, of all different colors and backgrounds. It's an honorable profession serving the community, and children who are raised in cop households often grow up with the same sense of civic responsibility as their parents. I even know of one family in the Washington, DC, area who has family (cousins, brothers, etc.) in almost every police department in and around the city. Meet one \"Officer Wigglesworth\" and I guarantee you, he's related to all of the others.\n\nBut the times, they are a'changin. And not for the better. Because the overall attitude toward law enforcement has shifted and changed. The profession that was so revered after 9/11 has instead become itself the target of hate. A lot of people have tried to make the community's problems with law enforcement a race issue. But the cop killers are indiscriminate as to whom they murder. Black, white, Hispanic, Asian - it's all about the color of the uniform, so to speak, not the color of the officer's skin.\n\nOfficer Randolph Holder, a 33-year-old member of the New York Police Department, and a third generation cop, was gunned down by a bike thief a few days ago .\n\nOnly seven people showed up for a community walk led by clergy for Officer Holder on Thursday night, two days after he was killed in the line of duty. The murdered police officer was black. And his family is outraged that Holder isn't getting the same sort of attention from black community leaders that Michael Brown, Eric Garner, and Freddie Gray got when they died resisting arrest. They've even got Al Sharpton on the defensive, because how can he explain the way he rushed to the side of every other family and can't seem to pencil in the Holders? It's a valid complaint. While so many in the #BlackLivesMatter movement want to paint a white face on law enforcement, Holder was a black immigrant representing the very best of the American dream. Where is the community's outrage that Randolph Holder has been murdered? If Holder had dodged his murderer's bullet, and shot back and killed him, how would that community have responded? I believe we would be seeing riots, and protestors with their hands up, and everybody screaming that the dead guy was \"just a bike thief\" and didn't deserve to die for his crimes. The thing is, Officer Holder definitely didn't deserve to die for the bike thief's crimes. He was just doing his job to protect that community. He and his partner had responded to a 911 call.\n\nNo matter how much complaining, ranting, and protesting has been done by people, who does EVERYONE call at the first sign of trouble when they need help, including the criminals? The police. \"Dial 911 for help\" is (or should be) drummed into every little child as soon as they're old enough to pick up the telephone. Children are told that if they're lost or in trouble they should look for a police officer to help them. When everyone else is running away from a dangerous situation, the police run to it - as fast as they can - to intervene and help. Firefighters do the same thing, but in bad neighborhoods, they usually do it with a police escort or backup.\n\nIt's hard to listen to my husband, a retired Captain from the Metro Transit Police Department in DC, talk to other cops about \"the job\" now. While they once boasted to each other about the good work they'd done, the bad guys they arrested, and the people they saved, now they talk about how screwed up everything is. My husband's youngest son wanted to be a police officer, but he ended up taking a different professional route. My husband now says \"thank God\" none of his children followed in his footsteps.\n\n\"I would NEVER tell anyone to become a cop now,\" he says. \"If you want to help people, you should become a firefighter.\" Then again, the rioters in Baltimore were throwing things at firetrucks and cutting the water hoses, as the firefighters tried to put out the flames in the burning buildings during the Baltimore riots. We all KNOW that's true because we watched it happen live on CNN . And then a Baltimore firefighter was shot in uniform not too long after that. The same day Holder was shot, two Detroit paramedics were attacked with knives while treating a patient.\n\nWhen I listen to my husband talking to other cops - retired and active-duty - they all say the same thing. All of them are proud of being police officers, but NONE of them would become a cop today with the way police are being demonized, police departments are being \"de-militarized,\" and political mouthpieces are calling for a \"softer, friendlier look\" for police officers. It's demoralizing and demeaning. And don't ask police spouses and family what we think about it.\n\nYou want us to put our husbands and wives and fathers and mothers and sons and daughters wearing blue in the line of fire wearing fuzzy track suits with a badge embroidered on them? Forget the tasers and guns, let's give them stickers with smiley or frowny faces, and they can simply label citizens so that children know whom they should avoid. And forget those mean handcuffs, let's use the honor system.\n\n\"Sir, I'm arresting you for beating your wife into oblivion, and now I'd like you to politely follow me to the car so I can take you down to the station, where we'd like you to smile for some pictures from three angles. Please?\" Right, cuz that works. Not.\n\nThe reason police cars are designed the way they are is because so many crazy and/or drugged-up suspects try to kick out the windows, spit at the cops, and do other disgusting things. That's just some of the glory of police work. Don't pretend you haven't watched \"Cops\" and cringed.\n\nOfficer Holder's mother, Princess Holder, has spoken out already, calling for New York to bring back their \"stop and frisk\" policy that the current mayor didn't support. She's right - more arrests are made when police initiate regular traffic stops and check for warrants, and question other suspicious characters, than any other way. But if you don't let police create a safe environment for themselves when they're doing their jobs, they cannot be expected to keep our communities safe.\n\nOfficer Holder was shot in the head trying to catch a bicycle thief. In 2001, Officer Marlon Morales , of the DC-area Metro Transit Police (my husband's department), was shot in the head while trying to stop a fare evader in a Metro station. Nowadays, police have to assume that every suspect, for even the slightest infraction, may be armed, because that's often true.\n\nIt scares the hell out of me that we will not have another generation of good cops coming onto police departments because of the hatred and political environment. I don't want any of our family members or friends to join the police department, but I also don't want to live in a country where the people who should have been the cops don't want to be anymore. And that's a totally legitimate concern. Not all of the people who do want to be a part of the new generation of cops will be the best ones for the job. You're supposed to join law enforcement because you want to keep the peace, not jump on board for the sole purpose of being a part of neutralizing crazy riots.\n\nUndermining the authority of the police, and preventing them from doing their jobs as they've been trained -- for political purposes -- is destroying the fabric of the law enforcement community. It makes the police stop caring about enforcing laws. It makes them afraid to intervene when there's a chance they'll be criminally charged for doing their jobs. It makes nobody want to grow up and become a police officer like daddy or mommy, anymore. And that is a huge problem.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

We need strong, professional police officers who are not afraid to enforce our laws and keep our streets safe.

      "text": "The Crackdown on Cop City Protesters Is So Brutal Because of the Movement's Success\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nOne protester was killed by police, 20 were charged under a \"domestic terror\" law, and Georgia's governor gave himself broad \"emergency\" powers.\n\nFirefighters work to extinguish a fire after an Atlanta police vehicle was set on fire during a Stop Cop City protest in Atlanta, Ga., on Jan. 21, 2023.\n\nThe movement to stop the construction of a $90 million police training center atop vast acres of Atlanta forest has been extraordinarily successful over the last year. With little national fanfare, Defend the Atlanta Forest/Stop Cop City activists nimbly deployed a range of tactics : encampments, tree-sits, peaceful protest marches, carefully targeted property damage, local community events, investigative research, and, at times, direct confrontation with police forces attempting to evict protesters from the forest. The proposed militarized training compound known as Cop City has thus far been held at bay.\n\nThe Atlanta-based movement should be seen as an example of rare staying power, thoughtful strategizing, and the crucial articulation of environmentalist politics situated in anti-racist, Indigenous, and abolitionist struggle. Unsurprisingly, however, significant national attention has only been drawn to the forest defenders in the last week thanks to the extreme law enforcement repression they are now facing.\n\nA forest defender was killed by police last Wednesday, and a total of 19 protesters now face capricious and ungrounded domestic terror charges for their involvement in the movement - a rare deployment of a state domestic terror statute , threatening to exhaust and crush a resilient and developing movement.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nOn Thursday, Georgia's Republican Gov. Brian Kemp announced a \"state of emergency\" in response to the protests in downtown Atlanta in the week following the killing of the protester. The executive order grants the governor's office extensive and preemptive repressive powers, including the ability to call on as many as 1,000 National Guard troops to quell protests at any moment.\n\n\"This is an unprecedented level of repression,\" said Marlon Kautz, 38, an Atlanta-based organizer with the Atlanta Solidarity Fund , which provides bail funds and legal support to protesters who are targeted for involvement in social movements, including against Cop City.\n\n\"At this point the police seem to be charging every protester they arrest with 'domestic terrorism' regardless of the circumstances,\" he said. \"The other pattern we've noticed is they are charging everyone arrested on a given day with all crimes which happened that day.\"\n\nKautz told me, by way of example, that during a protest in which a police car was burned, all arrestees from the day now face arson charges. \"Needless to say, the law doesn't work this way, so we interpret this as a strategy of blatant malicious prosecution.\"\n\nThe Defend the Atlanta Forest movement endeavors to combine the tactics of, and to learn from, previous struggles - including the 2016 encampments at Standing Rock and the 2020 George Floyd uprisings - while experimenting with novel resistance compositions . The escalatory response from police and prosecutors, on the other hand, reveals a new and troubling combination of counterinsurgent strategies.\n\nThe forest defenders have already faced months of aggressive policing and intimidation, which escalated into deadly violence during a multiagency raid last Wednesday. Police shot and killed 26-year-old Manuel \"Tortuguita\" Terán. The authorities claim that Tortuiguita shot at them first, wounding an officer - a narrative fiercely challenged by fellow activists and family members.\n\nProtests and vigils sprung up nationwide demanding \"justice for Tort,\" while mainstream environmental organizations, including Greenpeace and the Sierra Club , alongside left-wing Reps. Cori Bush, D-Mo., and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., condemned the police's violence and called for an independent investigation into the activist's killing. Up until this point, they had said little about the year-plus long struggle against Cop City.\n\nAs forest defenders mourn and seek justice for their fallen friend, the movement must also fight a barrage of excessive criminal charges, most notably state domestic terrorism charges carrying a possible 35 years in prison.\n\n\"Since December, the police have repeatedly stormed the forest with military-grade weapons, pointed assault rifles at protesters, fired chemical weapons at tree sitters, and used chainsaws in an attempt to dismantle treehouses with tree sitters still in them,\" said Elias, a 24-year-old Atlanta-based student in the movement, who asked to withhold his full name for fear of police harassment. \"Their decision to create a dangerous, volatile, chaotic situation now has led to the murder of our friend Tortuguita.\"\n\nElias told me \"the police are trying to justify their negligence by charging people with domestic terrorism. However, nothing these protesters have done even remotely resembles domestic terrorism. The police are trying to redefine terrorism to mean 'sitting in a treehouse' or 'breaking windows.'\"\n\nRead our complete coverage\n\nThe terror charges, all handed down within the last two months, were not from nowhere. Political and business interests behind Cop City have been pushing related rhetoric for well over a year. Communications records uncovered by activists between Cop City supporters - local self-identifying \"stakeholders,\" business owners, council members, and Atlanta law enforcement officials - show that these parties have been calling the protesters \"eco-terrorists\" since at least last April.\n\nThough no one has yet been convicted on these bogus terror charges, Kemp, the governor, has readily used the term \"domestic terrorists\" to describe the arrestees. Kemp has also invoked the tired trope of \"outside agitators\" to delegitimize an Atlanta-based movement, which has made a point to invite activists to join from out of state. Notably, in recognition that the land on which Atlanta stands was stolen in the 1800s from the Muscogee (Creek) people, the forest protest encampment has been host to dozens of visitors from around the country who descended from the displaced Indigenous community.\n\nThe recent wave of arrests are part and parcel of a \"green scare,\" which began in the 1990s and has seen numerous environmental and animal rights activists labeled and charged as terrorists on a federal level consistently for no more than minor property destruction. Yet the Atlanta cases mark the first use of a state domestic terrorism statute against either an environmental or anti-racist movement.\n\nThe 19 protesters are being charged under a Georgia law passed in 2017, which, according to the Republican state senator who introduced the bill, was intended to combat cases like the Boston Marathon bombing, Dylann Roof's massacre of nine Black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, and the Orlando Pulse nightclub shooting.\n\n\"During legislative debate over this law, the concern was raised that as written, the law was so broad that it could be used to prosecute Black Lives Matter activists blocking the highway as terrorists. The response was simply that prosecutors wouldn't do that,\" Kautz told me. \"There are similar laws passed in many other states, and we believe that the existence of these laws on the books is a threat to democracy and the right to protest.\"\n\nThe Georgia law is exceedingly broad. Domestic terrorism under the statute includes the destruction or disabling of ill-defined \"critical infrastructure,\" which can be publicly or privately owned, or \"a state or government facility\" with the intention to \"alter, change, or coerce the policy of the government\" or \"affect the conduct of the government\" by use of \"destructive devices.\" What counts as critical infrastructure here? A bank branch window? A police vehicle? Bulldozers deployed to raze the forest? What is a destructive device? A rock? A firework? And is not a huge swathe of activism the attempt to coerce a government to change policies?\n\nPolice affidavits on the arrest warrants of forest defenders facing domestic terror charges include the following as alleged examples of terrorist activity: \"criminally trespassing on posted land,\" \"sleeping in the forest,\" \"sleeping in a hammock with another defendant,\" being \"known members\" of \"a prison abolitionist movement,\" and aligning themselves with Defend the Atlanta Forest by \"occupying a tree house while wearing a gas mask and camouflage clothing.\"\n\nIt is for good reason that leftists, myself included, have challenged the expansion of anti-terror laws in the wake of the January 6 Capitol riots or other white supremacist attacks. Terrorism laws operate to name the state and capital's ideological enemies; they will be reliably used against anti-capitalists, leftists, and Black liberationists more readily than white supremacist extremists with deep ties to law enforcement and the Republican right.\n\nSince its passage in 2017, the Georgia domestic terrorism law has not resulted in a single conviction. As such, there has been no occasion to challenge the law's questionable constitutionality. Chris Bruce, policy director at the American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that \"the statute establishes overly broad, far-reaching limitations that restrict public dissent of the government and criminalizes violators with severe and excessive penalties.\" He said of the forest defender terror charges that they are \"wholly inapposite at worst and flimsy at best.\"\n\n\"The state is attempting to innovate new repressive prosecution, and I think ultimately that will fail for them,\" Sara, a 32-year-old service worker who lives by the imperiled forest and has been part of Stop Cop City since the movement began, told me.\n\n\"What we are seeing bears some resemblance to the J20 case, where prosecutors attempted to put blanket charges on people in the vicinity of a protest,\" said Sara, who also asked to withhold her surname for fear of police harassment. She described the strategy as \"an expensive and dangerous prosecutorial endeavor.\"\n\nThe J20 prosecutions didn't involve terror charges but rested on infirm claims of collective culpability, which flew in the face of the legal standard requiring individual probable cause for arrest. Those prosecutions fell apart, but not before traumatizing and exhausting the resources of the 200-plus people charged and their communities.\n\n\"The authorities' legal strategy seems to be to load protesters up with extreme charges with no intention of actually making them stick, simply to discourage continued protest,\" Kautz, of the Atlanta Solidarity Fund, told me.\n\nAt present, seven of the 19 forest defenders facing terror charges are being held either with bond denied or set unaffordably high. Supporters are working to raise funds to ensure their freedom and cover legal fees, while refusing to abandon the forest defense.\n\n\"It's evident the Atlanta-area law enforcement, including prosecutors, believe heavy charges will crush dissent. Instead, the movement seems to have only grown with every attack from the police,\" said Sara.\n\nShe noted that the violent raid and Tortuguita's killing has been \"especially devastating and heart-wrenching\" but that \"many people are newly moved to action.\" In the last week, as many as 50 acts of solidarity - from vigils to banner drops to protests - have taken place across the country to honor Tortuguita and to express support for those in Atlanta defending the forest against Cop City and the violence it represents.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Officer in Cop City Bodycam Footage Suggests Fellow Cop Was Shot by Friendly Fire\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nFootage from the aftermath of a deadly police raid on anti-Cop City protesters shows an Atlanta cop asking, \"They shoot their own man?\"\n\nA Georgia state trooper shot and killed a protester last month in Atlanta's ongoing demonstration to stop the construction of a police training facility in a local forest. During the joint raid by local and state law enforcement, a state trooper was also reportedly shot in the groin.\n\nPolice quickly established a narrative that took hold in the media: As police advanced to clear the protest camp on the grounds of the planned facility, which demonstrators dubbed \"Cop City,\" the trooper was fired upon and hit.\n\nIn response, the police said, officers shot and killed 26-year-old Manuel Terán, a protester who went by the name Tortuguita. An independent autopsy released Friday showed Terán was shot at least 13 times. Police said forensics showed that the round that injured the officer matched a gun found nearby, which Terán had bought.\n\nDocumentary evidence of the killing was scant: State troopers, who were directly involved in the killing, don't wear body cameras in general. And while Atlanta police, whose officers were nearby, do, the department said in an initial statement on January 20 that no footage would be released from the operation, pending an ongoing investigation.\n\nMoments after police opened fire on Tortugita, killing them, and Atlanta Police officer can be heard saying, \"Man...you fucked your own officer up?\" in reference to the trooper that was also shot. pic.twitter.com/qw8G0G34b0\n\n- Atlanta Community Press Collective (@atlanta_press) February 9, 2023\n\nOn Wednesday night, however, the department reversed course and released body camera video from just after the incident. The footage appears to show officers asking whether the state trooper who had been shot was wounded by one of his own.\n\n\"You fucked your own officer up,\" one Atlanta Police Department officer is heard saying in the footage released Wednesday. He later walks up to two other officers and asks, \"They shoot their own man?\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you.

Our investigation does not support that statement.\"\n\nAfter initially declining to comment and referring questions to the GBI, a spokesperson from the Atlanta Police Department sent a statement to The Intercept after this story was published. \"In reviewing our officers Body Worn Cameras footage, it is apparent the shooting situation evolved quickly and our officers had no immediate knowledge of the events at the shooting site at the time the shooting occurred,\" Sgt. John Chafee, a spokesperson with the Atlanta police's public affairs unit, said in the statement. \"Several responding officers are heard commenting about the shooting as they approached the site. We have found no evidence to suggest these officers had any information on the events surrounding the shooting prior to their comments.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Georgia Department of Public Safety directed questions to the GBI.\n\nRead our complete coverage The People vs. Cop City\n\nRead our complete coverage\n\nThe shooting came as opposition mounted against Cop City, a massive $90 million training facility slated to overtake one of the largest patches of green spaces in the local area near Atlanta. At the time of the raid, the growing coalition of protesters, calling themselves forest defenders, had successfully blocked any progress toward construction of the facility.\n\nIn the aftermath of the deadly raid, initial GBI reports said that Terán had not complied with officers' commands and shot the trooper during the \"clearing operation.\" Terán's mother has said she does not believe they shot an officer.\n\nAfter stating immediately that no camera footage of the shooting existed, GBI had acknowledged publicly five days later that footage did exist of the shooting's aftermath.\n\nUpdate: February 9, 2023, 4:45 p.m. ET This story has been updated to include a statement that the Georgia Bureau of Investigation referred The Intercept to after publication.\n\nUpdate: February 10, 2023 This story has been updated to include a statement from the Atlanta Police Department made after publication.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Cop City Indictments Threaten Press Freedom Too\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe message is clear: Try to spread opinions cops don't like through the media, and you might be charged next.\n\nGeorgia Attorney General Chris Carr speaks during a news conference to discuss the recent indictment of 61 defendants in Fulton County on Sept. 5, 2023.\n\nThe disturbing indictment of 61 people who protested the Georgia police training facility commonly referred to as \"Cop City\" lays bare everything that is wrong with RICO laws and the prosecutors who abuse them. Even the author of the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law, on which the Georgia law is based, agrees that it's meant to fight organized crime, not stifle dissent.\n\nThe implications of the indictment for press freedom may seem like an afterthought considering everything else that is terrible about it. Its working theory is essentially that whenever some members of a protest movement commit crimes, everyone involved in the movement is responsible for the \"conspiracy,\" no matter how tenuous their connection to the alleged offense. It seeks to criminalize a centuries-old political theory - anarchism - and to frame the activism following George Floyd's murder as a plot by domestic terrorists (the indictment says the quiet part out loud by listing the date Floyd was killed as the start of the \"conspiracy\"). Perhaps most importantly, it has upended the lives of all those baselessly indicted.\n\nThat said, the threat to press freedom is real and shouldn't be ignored. Any source considering talking to a journalist about a protest or controversial cause couldn't be blamed for thinking twice after reading the indictment .\n\n\"Defend the Atlanta Forest uses websites, social media, and statements to traditional media to sow disinformation and propaganda to promote its extremist political agenda, legitimize its behavior, and recruit new members,\" prosecutors allege. \"[I]n an effort to de-legitimize the facts as relayed by law enforcement ... members of Defend the Atlanta Forest often contact news media and flood social media with claims that their unlawful actions are protected by the First Amendment.\"\n\nThe indictment also alleges that Defend the Atlanta Forest has \"worked with external entities to produce videos and podcast interviews\" where they discuss \"anti-authority movements\"; that the group holds \"media-attended press conferences to control the story and promote their own narrative\"; and that it posts \"press releases, misleading information, propaganda, and disinformation\" on its website.\n\nThe message is clear: Try to spread opinions cops don't like through the media, and you might find your name listed after \"State v.\"\n\nRead our complete coverage\n\nIncidentally, it was cops, not protesters, who broke the law in trying to control the media narrative about Cop City. Here's video of an officer threatening to arrest a journalist and seize his footage unless he agrees to give police favorable coverage. And when a journalist tried to cover the protests firsthand, they stole his notes . At another protest two days after the indictment, police shot down and seized a documentary crew's drone as it filmed the events. But, according to the indictment, seeking to influence media coverage is a \"traditional activity of anarchist organizations.\"\n\nThe indictment's framing of \" zines \" containing \"anarchist ideas\" as evidence of some sinister plot is just as dangerous as its effort to criminalize talking to journalists. The indictment might leave the impression that the zines contain nothing but catnip for wannabe radicals. In reality, many of them are academic - or even journalistic - in tone. They discuss everything from public records revealing Cop City contractors' political contributions to research by environmental organizations on the projects' impact on carbon sequestration rates . One, called \"A Brief History of the Atlanta City Prison Farm,\" contains 164 footnotes. Sure, the zines include ideas some may find disagreeable. But citing them as proof of a conspiracy is an affront to the First Amendment.\n\nAnd the indictment's assaults on publishers don't stop there: It also finds criminality in, for example, taking photos and videos of officers to \"spread the message of Defend the Atlanta Forest,\" posting photos of the Atlanta Police Foundation project manager, and posting links to news stories about the protests.\n\nFederal appellate courts with jurisdiction over Georgia have joined courts everywhere else in declaring filming and photographing police in public to be protected First Amendment activity. But the indictment nonetheless lumps actions like these into the \"conspiracy,\" often through the laughably convoluted allegation that they were intended to \"cause and induce the construction officials to withhold records, documents, and testimony in official proceedings.\"\n\nThe indictment also threatens the press by attacking basic digital security practices journalists and activists both routinely use to avoid illegal surveillance . Ironically, the same prosecutors trying to criminalize taking pictures and talking to journalists can't think of any reason why protesters might have wanted to avoid prying government eyes, or prepare for potential run-ins with cops, unless they were committing actual crimes.\n\nProsecutors also allege that protesters' intent to break the law is evidenced by their \"memorizing or writing the Atlanta Solidarity Fund's phone number on their body in case of arrest.\" As we wrote in April , journalists, like protesters , write legal aid numbers on their persons \"not because journalists intend to commit crimes [but] because police have an unfortunate habit of arresting journalists for doing their jobs.\"\n\nThey also cite protesters' use of \"online security measures which disguise a user's true identity, such as the use of Virtual Private Networks (VPN)\" and their use of \"end-to-end encrypted messaging app[s] Signal or Telegram\" to \"prevent[] law enforcement from viewing their communication.\"\n\nTechnologies like VPN and encryption aren't criminal; press freedom organizations recommend them to journalists worldwide. Last month's unlawful police raid of a newsroom in Marion, Kansas, provides a clear illustration of why journalists should use encryption . Same goes for other noncriminals whose communications might interest law enforcement. Earlier this year, we learned that police in North Carolina cited a journalist's anarchist beliefs as a pretext to illegally search their phone (which, fortunately, was encrypted).\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nIf certain Cop City protesters committed real crimes, then prosecutors can bring charges against those protesters, individually, that are proportionate to their alleged infractions. Instead they're trying to elevate relatively small-time offenses, like property damage and allegedly improper petty reimbursements, into racketeering - and throwing the First and Fourth Amendments to the wind in the process. Prosecutors are sworn to uphold the Constitution; drawing criminal inferences from things like talking to journalists to avoiding illegal surveillance is offensive.\n\nScholars and activists have criticized RICO laws, and particularly their use against First Amendment activity, for decades. This unconstitutional indictment should finally force lawmakers to do something about the problem.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "DHS Intel Report on Cop City Protesters Cribbed Far-Right Activist Andy Ngo\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe intelligence report described the demonstrations as a \"violent far-left occupation\" - a phrase copied directly from an article by Ngo a day earlier.\n\nA Department of Homeland Security agency's intelligence report about the Atlanta protest movement \"Stop Cop City\" lifted a sentence nearly verbatim from an article published on a far-right news website a day earlier.\n\nThe December 16, 2022, report from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's Office for Bombing Prevention describes protesters opposed to razing a forest for a massive new police facility as \"militants\" comprising a \"violent far-left occupation\" - phrasings identical to an article written by right-wing provocateur Andy Ngo .\n\n\"Five militants, part of the violent far-left occupation, were arrested and charged with domestic terrorism and other felony charges,\" said the CISA report, referring to protests against the construction of the police facility, dubbed \"Cop City\" by its opponents.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nA day earlier, the Post Millennial, a conservative news outlet founded by Ngo that has faced criticism for its partisan bent and misleading stories on subjects like Covid-19 , ran a story with the same sentence, with small cosmetic changes. \"Five militants part of a violent far-left occupation in south Atlanta were arrested on Tuesday and charged with domestic terrorism and other felony charges,\" Ngo's original reads. (Neither CISA nor Ngo immediately responded to a request for comment.)\n\nAfter publication of this story, DHS blocked public access to the intelligence report .\n\nThe DHS report came a month before one protester encamped at the proposed Cop City site was killed in a hail of police gunfire - a massive escalation in what has become an ongoing crackdown against the movement.\n\nThe term \"militants\" used by federal agents in December reflects the escalation: a catchall for targets of the U.S.'s so-called global war on terror, the buzzword not typically used to describe domestic actors. That it has filtered into DHS reporting on protest movements is reflective of the new focus on domestic terrorism, particularly after the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nIn March, prosecutors began hitting anti-Cop City protesters with domestic terrorism charges for alleged attacks with rocks and Molotov cocktails. Since then, the trend of terror allegations has continued, ensnaring a growing group of actors in the movement, with more than 40 now facing terror charges. When administrators of a bail fund for protesters were charged with money laundering last week, Republican Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said they had \"facilitated and encouraged domestic terrorism.\"\n\n\"The nature of the law enforcement response to the Stop Cop City protests, and the prosecutions of protesters and their supporters highlights how broad domestic terrorism laws are used as a political cudgel rather than a mechanism to improve public safety,\" Mike German, a former FBI special agent and fellow with the Brennan Center for Justice, told The Intercept.\n\nThe CISA report was posted to the Technical Resource for Incident Prevention, or TRIPwire, a resource sharing portal for \"expert intelligence analysis\" in order to raise \"awareness of evolving Improvised Explosive Device (IED) tactics,\" according to its website. In March, activists involved in the movement were accused of using Molotov cocktails - which are not listed in a DHS document defining the term - but there does not appear to be any record of IED allegations before the December CISA report.\n\nRead our complete coverage\n\nOn Monday, Atlanta City Council will vote on the budget for the Atlanta Public Safety Training Center, the law enforcement training facility at the center of the controversy. The facility is expected to take up over 85 acres, replete with a mock city for \"urban police training.\" Cop City, expected to cost $90 million , was announced in 2021 by then-Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. Since then, protesters have taken up camp in the forest where the facility would be built, in an effort to block its construction.\n\nOn March 5, following the alleged Molotov attack against police, Georgia authorities charged 23 protesters with domestic terrorism. The terror enhancement of the charges have prompted criticism from civil liberties groups.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we have seen law enforcement across the country treating environmental activists and racial justice protesters as terrorists, despite the lack of deadly violence associated with this activism,\" said German.\n\nThe focus on domestic terrorism has been shared by leaders of both parties. In 2020, then-President Donald Trump vowed to designate \"antifa\" as a terrorist organization. President Joe Biden, in his first full day in office, directed his national security team to conduct a 100-day, comprehensive review of U.S. government efforts to address domestic terrorism - described by the White House as \"the most urgent terrorism threat the United States faces today.\"\n\nSince then, charges against participants in the January 6 attack have caused domestic terror prosecutions to increase sharply.\n\nIn 2022, House Democrats passed a bill, the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act, which would have created new offices designed to focus on domestic terrorism specifically, in DHS, the FBI, and the Justice Department. By a vote of 47-47, Senate Republicans blocked the legislation.\n\nThe Atlanta protesters are being prosecuted under the same domestic terrorism law that was expanded after Dylann Roof murdered nine Black parishioners at a church in Charleston, South Carolina. While the law originally only applied to criminal acts intended to kill at least 10 people, the Georgia legislature expanded the law to include property crimes intending to intimidate or coerce the government - of which the Atlanta protesters stand accused.\n\nAs for the CISA report, though it cribbed Any Ngo, German said it made for a limited resource because of the complete lack of citations.\n\n\"This type of intelligence reporting is of dubious utility because it doesn't contain enough detail for law enforcement to assess the credibility of the information provided so they can develop a proper response,\" German told The Intercept. \"It includes no citations so it doesn't even provide an avenue for law enforcement to follow up for more information or link events to understand a larger pattern.\"\n\nGerman added, \"There doesn't appear to be any attempt to put these three events in context so police officials could determine whether the events are part of some larger issue of law enforcement concern.\"\n\nUpdate: June 6, 2023 This story has been updated to include a PDF version of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency intelligence report. After publication of this story, the Department of Homeland Security blocked access to the report in its public-facing document portal.\n\nWAIT!

Superior Court on May 21, heads turned. A few minutes earlier, he had testified in the trial of four people accused of rioting in downtown Washington during Donald Trump's inauguration; it was the second trial group to face a jury. In accordance with Metro Police rules, Chatman had pulled another \"cover shirt\" over his uniform after concluding his testimony.\n\nChatman is a big man, thickly built and broad-shouldered, with a slight paunch and shaved head. What caught the attention of those assembled in the courthouse, however, was not his imposing size, but the text on the back of his off-white T-shirt. Under an image of a nightstick enlaced with a pair of handcuffs, it read, in capital letters, \"Police brutality ... or doing what their parents should have?\"\n\n\"I was absolutely horrified,\" said Andy Switzer, a former defendant from Philadelphia whose charges were dismissed in January, \"that a police witness would have the gall to wear that shirt in a courthouse, immediately after offering testimony about brutal police behavior. It's startling.\"\n\nIn this photo, taken by a defense lawyer who asked not to be named, William Chatman can be seen wearing a pro-police brutality T-shirt at the D.C. Superior Court. The shirt, which was photographed by a defense attorney, may violate D.C. police rules that prohibit officers from wearing clothing that contains language \"of a social, economic or political nature that might be considered as an advocacy statement, or which might create controversy.\" A D.C. officer was disciplined in October 2017 for visiting the same courthouse wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the name of his police unit, the Grim Reaper, and a pre-Christian cross favored by white supremacists.\n\nIn this photo, taken by a defense lawyer who asked not to be named, William Chatman can be seen wearing a pro-police brutality T-shirt at the D.C. Superior Court.\n\nAsked about Chatman's choice of attire, D.C. police spokesperson Hugh Carew told The Intercept, \"We are aware of the photograph and our Internal Affairs Bureau is investigating.\"\n\nBefore donning his infamous T-shirt, Chatman had offered key testimony for the J20 prosecution. Chatman narrated the events of January 20, 2017, as Assistant U.S. Attorney Jennifer Kerkhoff played police body camera footage for the jury - images of black-clad protesters wreaking havoc along 13th Street. A member of the Civil Disturbance Unit, Chatman rode behind the marchers on a Harley-Davidson 883 motorcycle during the protest. Throughout his testimony, he referred to the defendants as \"rioters,\" even after Judge Kimberley Knowles sustained a defense objection to that term. \"These are experienced rioters,\" he said at one point, after the judge's ruling.\n\nIt \"seemed as if there were people in charge\" of the group, Chatman testified. They were issuing \"commands\" to fellow marchers: \"'Let's go, break that, grab that, get this' - things of that nature,\" Chatman explained. His testimony is central to the prosecution's argument that J20 protesters were a well-organized and purposeful group, consistent with the legal definitions of \"riot\" and \"conspiracy\" -  a novel approach used by the government to indict hundreds of people on felony charges for the alleged criminal acts of a select few.\n\nOriginal reporting.

The government's case against the J20 defendants continues to unravel. The first tranche of J20 defendants was found innocent by a jury , and shortly thereafter, charges against 129 other protesters were dropped . Last week, a judge sanctioned prosecutors for failing to turn over some 69 recordings of potentially exculpatory evidence to the defense, a violation of pretrial discovery rules. Judge Robert Morin prohibited prosecutors from using those videos as evidence in two upcoming trials and forbade the government from pursuing \"conspiracy\" charges against defendants in those trial groups. In response, prosecutors dropped all charges against an additional 10 defendants.\n\nChatman, second from right, leaves the D.C. Superior Court on May 29th after Chatman was questioned about wearing the shirt. Photo: Gary Roland Yet the prosecutions have continued: Forty-six people still face charges. Last Thursday, a jury began deliberating in the case against defendants Anthony Felice, Seth Cadman, Casey Webber, and Michael Basillas; this week, jurors acquitted Webber on all charges and Cadman on all but \"engaging in a riot,\" on which the jury was deadlocked, prompting Knowles to declare a mistrial for that charge. The jury has yet to reach a verdict for the others. The government's case in this trial, too, relied on video evidence - recorded by the far-right Project Veritas media group - that Morin deemed inadmissible in the upcoming trials.\n\nChatman, second from right, leaves the D.C. Superior Court on May 29th after Chatman was questioned about wearing the shirt.\n\nAmid this confusion and prosecutorial malfeasance, the T-shirt story epitomized another budding theme of the J20 case: The government's reliance on police witnesses with apparent proclivities toward extreme politics - and, in Chatman's case, a past brush with accusations of police brutality.\n\n\"These cases were always about right-wing police and prosecutors following Trump's lead to go after left-wing protesters using a broad theory of liability,\" said Mark Goldstone, an attorney for multiple J20 defendants. \"So it's no surprise that a police witness would express such political hostility.\"\n\n\"What is surprising,\" Goldstone added, \"is the stupidity of an officer showing up in court wearing that shirt.\"\n\nDefendants and their supporters have repeatedly accused D.C. police of excessive force during the inauguration protest. A report issued by D.C.'s Office of Police Complaints, on February 27, 2017, details a litany of violent acts committed by police on January 20, 2017, including \"indiscriminately\" deploying stinger grenades, pepper-spraying crowds without warning, and manhandling protesters engaged in civil disobedience. In response to the initial report, the D.C. City Council appropriated $150,000 to conduct an independent investigation of police conduct on January 20.\n\nChatman featured in some of the violent incidents that day. During cross examination on May 21, Chatman admitted to driving his motorcycle into a protester but denied that it was intentional. \"He turned to block my path and we met,\" Chatman said.\n\n\"They were nudging people with their motorcycles to push us forward. Treating us like animals,\" said Jennifer Armento, a defendant who was acquitted in the first trial. \"It was horrifying.\" Armento felt she couldn't stop running, even as she began to suffer an asthma attack brought on by exhaustion, tear gas, and engine fumes.\n\nChatman's decision to wear a T-shirt endorsing police brutality is especially brazen given his own history. Between 2008 and 2016, Chatman was involved in litigation over allegations that he and another officer assaulted a Maryland family - including two minors - during a Caribbean Carnival parade.\n\nOn June 28, 2008, Rosena Rudder, her husband Roger, and their 5-year-old daughter were walking alongside the Carnival parade on Georgia Avenue in Washington, D.C. The Rudders were accompanied by Roger's sister, Noverlene Goss, and her own 15-year-old daughter.\n\nThe yearly parade is a joyous occasion for the Rudders, who are Trinidadian. According to court documents, their group momentarily left the sidewalk to go hug some costumed family members. As they wove their way back to the side of the road, Rosena told The Intercept in a phone interview last week , they came across Chatman, in his police uniform - sans T-shirt - who told them sternly to get back on the sidewalk.\n\n\"I said, 'Okay, we're moving.' But the streets are literally packed. You can't just beeline for the sidewalk,\" Rosena said, \"And I had my little girl to keep track of.\"\n\nA few moments later, Rosena said, Chatman stepped in the group's path again and said, \"Get to the sidewalk\" - this time more aggressively. \"As we tried to move around him, he got in my face. I could literally feel his breath. I stepped back and said, 'Don't touch me; we're going.'\"\n\nThis, Rosena recalled, set Chatman off; he shoved her and she fell to the ground.\n\n\"It was out of nowhere,\" Rosena said. \"My first thought was, 'Where is my daughter?' My second thought was, 'We're going to lose the baby.'\" Chatman had no way of knowing that Rosena was two months pregnant at the time - she was not showing and herself had not yet learned that she was carrying triplets. (Her three sons were born in good health seven months later.)\n\nRoger Rudder told The Intercept he saw Chatman pull his hand back, as if to hit Rosena on the ground. \"All my life, I've never felt powerless. But in that moment, I did,\" he said. \"It felt like there was nothing I could do right. Nothing I could have done to prevent it from escalating. That was his job.\" The blow was never delivered.\n\nPolice pepper-spray protesters and media during inauguration-day clashes in Washington, D.C., on January 20, 2017. Photo: Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images Chatman isn't the only police witness to find himself in hot water since the beginning of the J20 trials. Officer Michael Howden, who testified in the first trial, was overheard on body camera footage saying, \"I'm fairly accustomed to that sort of rioting ... herding people through Barry Farm when they're rioting, when they're out of control.\" Barry Farm is a predominately black, heavily policed public housing development in the Anacostia area of Washington.\n\nPolice pepper-spray protesters and media during inauguration-day clashes in Washington, D.C., on January 20, 2017.\n\nThe lead investigator in the J20 case, Detective Gregg Pemberton, also betrayed political bias against Black Lives Matter and left-wing protesters. \"You know what I haven't heard in a while?\" one of Pemberton's tweets from April 2017 reads, \"'Police shootings of unarmed black youth.' Did they run out of funding for their false narrative?\"\n\nPemberton also liked a tweet by controversial Wisconsin Sheriff David A. Clarke which read, \"America is upside down. Cops under attack threatens the rule of law. That is the aim of the leftist goons. Push back before it is too late.\" Pemberton testified in December that a \"cottage industry of people who just want to make money ... gum up the works\" for \"genuine activists.\"\n\nCommander Keith DeVille, who oversaw the police response to the J20 protest, admitted on cross-examination to joking that Raoul Wallenberg - a World War II-era Swedish diplomat credited with saving thousands  of Jews' lives, who has a street named after him in Washington - was \"the one that got away,\" apparently mistaking the diplomat for a Holocaust survivor. DeVille denied that he was homophobic despite warning fellow officers to watch what they said around a new colleague who was gay. DeVille was also disciplined by the department for complaining about having to call a transgender co-worker by her preferred name.\n\nThese kinds of right-wing sympathies are not uncommon among police officers, says Alex S. Vitale, a professor of sociology at Brooklyn College. \"Too many police in the U.S. remain committed to a 'thin blue line' view of the world, in which they see themselves as the only social force capable of holding civilization together.\"\n\n\"This worldview,\" Vitale said, \"justifies the use of violence to control suspect populations, because that is the only thing 'those people' will understand.\"\n\nAfter the incident with Chatman in 2008, the Rudders pursued several legal avenues.\n\n\"I know that if any other dude had put his hands on my wife, it wouldn't have been a question,\" Roger Rudder said. \"But I actually had to second guess stepping in front of my wife.\" For a split second, Roger imagined the consequences, for himself and his family, if Chatman were to respond \"the way police sometimes do in this country\" to a perceived threat.\n\nAccording to the Rudders, when Roger stepped between Chatman and his family, all hell broke loose. Police surrounded them, pulling them apart. Chatman tackled Roger. Rosena said another officer pushed her daughter to the ground and handcuffed her 15-year-old niece. Their court complaint narrates the same sequence of events.\n\nScreenshots from a video on June 28, 2008, showing Chatman, left frame in the center, and officers detaining Roger Rudder, at right on the ground. Images: Courtesy of the Rudder family In bystander video recorded just after the incident that was provided to The Intercept, at least six cops can be seen surrounding Rosena and her sister-in-law. Roger is pressed face down on the ground, two cops on top of him. Moments later, he is perfectly still, handcuffed on the pavement in a white shirt and black sweats. In the foreground, their 5-year-old daughter, wearing a pink tank top and blue-jean shorts, stretches to see what is happening to her mother.\n\nScreenshots from a video on June 28, 2008, showing Chatman, left frame in the center, and officers detaining Roger Rudder, at right on the ground.\n\n\"At some point, they also hit my sister-in-law and she fell,\" Rosena said. \"I remember we were able to look into each others' eyes as we lay on the ground. I just thought, 'What is happening?'\"\n\nAccording to Rosena, officers eventually pulled her up and handcuffed her. Before she was put in a patrol car, Rosena remembers a female officer threatened her: \"I am going to put [your daughter] so far in the system you'll never find her.\"\n\n\"Powerless,\" Roger again told The Intercept. \"If I had to use one word, that would be it.\"\n\nThe Rudders were arrested and eventually charged with misdemeanor assault on a police officer. They pled no contest and had to participate in a diversion program for first-time offenders. A few months later, the Rudders decided to file suit against Chatman and Shannon Williams, the female officer who allegedly threatened to put the Rudders' daughter in \"the system.\"\n\nThe suit didn't get far, dismissed in 2010 on primarily procedural grounds; their lawyer had failed to file their tort claims within the statute of limitations and unnecessarily conceded their constitutional complaints. In 2012, the Rudders appealed and won the right to refile their claim. In 2016, the parties finally agreed to a settlement of a few thousand dollars. Neither the department, nor Chatman or Williams, admitted any wrongdoing, having denied in earlier court filings that the violent encounter constituted assault and battery, excessive force, or false arrest. The Metro Police declined to comment on allegations against the officers.\n\nNeither of the Rudders feels that justice was served.\n\n\"When this happened, we really had it in our hearts that we wanted to make an impact,\" Roger Rudder said. \"I'm sure everyone who has police brutality occur to them or their loved ones feels the same way. It's just unfortunate that the avenues to make an impact are so few.\"\n\n\"By the end of it, we were exhausted,\" Rosena Rudder added. \"It's frustrating. Not only because no one was held accountable, but to hear that he\" - Chatman - \"is still out there doing the same thing. It's just so sad.\"\n\n\"By wearing that shirt, he's saying he's untouchable,\" Roger told The Intercept. \"The system allows him to feel that way. That's a dangerous mindset.\"\n\nA week after Chatman testified for the prosecution in the J20 case, defense attorneys entered photos of him wearing his police brutality shirt into evidence and called him to the stand, this time as a defense witness. On cross examination, Kerkhoff, the federal prosecutor, sought to downplay the seriousness of the message on Chatman's shirt.\n\n\"Is that a tongue-in-cheek comment on the perception that officers are constantly engaged in police brutality?\" Kerkhoff asked.\n\n\"Yeah, tongue-in-cheek, meaning that it's comedy,\" Chatman replied.\n\nIn follow-up questioning, defense attorney Rich Gallena struck an incredulous tone. \"So, the shirt is a joke?\" he asked.\n\n\"It is typically a joke,\" said Chatman.\n\n\"So, you think police brutality is a joke?\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" said Chatman.\n\nCorrection: June 13, 2018 This story initially referred to Raoul Wallenberg as a Holocaust survivor, based on Metro Police Commander Keith DeVille's cross-examination. In fact, Wallenberg was a Swedish diplomat recognized internationally for saving thousands of Hungarian Jews during World War II.\n\nTop photo: Police officers wearing tactical gear form a barrier with riot shields to prevent the movement of protesters after the inauguration of Donald Trump on Jan. 20, 2017, in Washington, D.C.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Atlanta Police Arrest Organizers of Bail Fund for Cop City Protesters\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nPart of a brutal crackdown on dissent against the police training facility, the SWAT raid and charges against the protest bail fund are unprecedented.\n\nThis house in the Edgewood neighborhood is where police arrested three key organizers who have been aiding protesters against the city's proposed police training center on May 31, 2023, in Atlanta.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, a heavily armed Atlanta Police Department SWAT team raided a house in Atlanta and arrested three of its residents. Their crime? Organizing legal support and bail funds for protesters and activists who have faced indiscriminate arrest and overreaching charges in the struggle to stop the construction of a vast police training facility - dubbed Cop City - atop a forest in Atlanta.\n\nIn a joint operation with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, or GBI, Atlanta cops charged Marlon Scott Kautz, Adele Maclean, and Savannah Patterson - all board members of the Atlanta Solidarity Fund - with \"money laundering\" and \"charity fraud.\"\n\nThe arrests are an unprecedented attack on bail funds and legal support organizations, a long-standing facet of social justice movements, according to Lauren Regan, executive director of the Civil Liberties Defense Center.\n\n\"This is the first bail fund to be attacked in this way,\" Regan, whose organization has worked to ensure legal support for people resisting Cop City, told me. \"And there is absolutely not a scintilla of fact or evidence that anything illegal has ever transpired with regard to Atlanta fundraising for bail support.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nWhile the Atlanta Solidarity Fund has been a crucial resource for activists facing harsh repression for their involvement in Stop Cop City, the nonprofit predates the movement and has been providing bail funds, jail support, and assistance with legal representation for Atlanta activists since the 2020 Black liberation uprisings.\n\nThe fund, a project of the registered nonprofit Network for Strong Communities, has also provided grants to support an array of anti-repression work in Atlanta, including to groups working with unhoused trans youth, Black worker-owned cooperatives, and abolitionist community builders.\n\n\"What happened this morning is a terrifying escalation by the state, and a chillingly direct attack on the First Amendment. This is fascist political repression,\" Hannah Riley, an Atlanta-based organizer, told me. \"Providing mutual aid to people exercising their constitutionally protected rights to protest and dissent is not a crime.\"\n\nA public statement from the GBI said that \"[a]gents and officers executed a search warrant and found evidence linking the three suspects to the financial crimes.\" The warrants for all three arrestees cite \"records and reports of certain currency transactions\" and \"fraudulent, misrepresenting, or misleading activities regarding charitable solitations.\" (\"Solitations\" is, of course, not a word, but the apparent misspelling of the word \"solicitations\" appears on all three arrestees' warrants.)\n\nA more detailed arrest warrant for Patterson notes that the alleged \"money laundering\" charge relates to reimbursements made from the nonprofit to Patterson's personal PayPal account for minor expenses including \"gasoline, forest clean-up, totes, covid rapid tests, media, yard signs and other miscellaneous expenses.\" Targeting the organizers with a militarized SWAT raid based on such expenditures only clarifies the desperation of law enforcement agencies in going after the movement.\n\nAccording to the GBI statement, \"All three charged will be booked into a local jail and will have a bond hearing scheduled soon.\"\n\nWednesday's arrests are just the latest in extreme law enforcement persecution of the popular Stop Cop City movement. A total of 42 activists are currently facing state domestic terror charges on the flimsiest of police claims, while three others face hefty felony intimidation charges for distributing flyers that named a police officer connected to the brutal police killing of 26-year-old forest defender Manuel \"Tortuguita\" Terán.\n\nKautz, one of the Atlanta Solidarity Fund organizers arrested on Wednesday, had previously shared numerous reflections with The Intercept on the Atlanta cops' extreme repressive tactics. He noted that the indiscriminate arrests and use of state domestic terrorism charges against protesters represented \"an unprecedented level of repression\" and a \"strategy of blatant malicious prosecution.\"\n\nIt is a vile irony that for his own role in legal support work and rightful criticism of police violence, Kautz is now part of this same pattern of apparent prosecutorial abuse.\n\nIn targeting the Atlanta Solidarity Fund, police and prosecutors are attempting to further the groundless narrative that the multifaceted movement against Cop City is a \"criminal organization,\" enabling profoundly unconstitutional arrests based on no more than association with a resilient anti-racist, environmentalist movement.\n\nPoliticians keen to see Cop City built in Atlanta have doubled down on the pernicious line, none more so than Georgia's Republican Gov. Brian Kemp. \"These criminals facilitated and encouraged domestic terrorism,\" said Kemp in a statement responding to Wednesday's arrests, despite the fact that no one has been convicted in the weak domestic terrorism cases.\n\nOrganizing bail funds and legal support for protesters facing charges, however serious, is a decades-old social justice movement practice. As the Atlanta Community Press Collective noted on Twitter, \"When Dr. King was held in Birmingham Jail, churches and community groups including the NAACP came together to fund his $4000 bail - the equivalent of $39,000 today.\"\n\nLike the overreaching domestic terrorism charges, if any established legal standards and precedents are upheld in these cases, no financial crimes or money-laundering charges will stick. Yet even unsuccessful malicious prosecutions exact a painful toll on movements, especially when a resource hub like the Atlanta Solidarity Fund is targeted.\n\n\"They are trying to drain our morale and trying to drain our resources,\" another person associated with the fund told me, withholding their name for fear of police persecution following their associates' arrests. \"These arrests send a message that if you run a nonprofit that they find to be at odds with their colonial project, they will target you.\"\n\nThe charges indeed risk setting a dangerous precedent in criminalizing bail funds and legal support networks. \"Bailing out protestors who exercise their constitutionally protected rights is simply not a crime. In fact, it is a historically grounded tradition in the very same social and political movements that the city of Atlanta prides itself on,\" said Regan, the attorney, in a separate press statement. \"Someone had to bail out civil rights activists in the 60's-I think we can all agree that community support isn't a crime.\"\n\nRead our complete coverage\n\nWednesday's arrests come just days after it was revealed by reporters that Atlanta officials have known for some time that the cost of building Cop City to the city of Atlanta would amount to at least $51 million in public funds, instead of the $30 million that city officials promised since 2021.\n\nLocal opposition to the project has been strong, with hundreds of people attending a recent city council meeting to speak out against Cop City during a public hearing. The city council will vote on whether to approve the growing cost of the vast militarized policing facility on June 5. \"The charges against organizers of the Atlanta Solidarity Fund come as the public becomes increasingly aware of the corporate funding and interests backing the Cop City project and the Atlanta Police Foundation non-profit,\" Nora Scholl from the Atlanta Community Press Collective told me. \"Law enforcement agencies are using force and imprisonment against protestors to buffer them from widespread opposition to the project.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Cop City Protesters Tried to Plant Trees. Atlanta Police Beat Them for It.\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nOrganizers swore off violence, but the cops used their garden tools as an excuse to attack them anyway.\n\nActivists march toward the construction site for the Atlanta Public Safety Training Center as part of the Block Cop City march in Atlanta on Nov. 13, 2023.\n\nDEKALB COUNTY, Ga. - Dozens of protesters began gathering early Monday morning in a small, unremarkable park in southeast Atlanta. By 9 a.m., over 400 people - a coalition of local Atlantans and visiting activists from around the country - had assembled to attend a day of protests dubbed \"Block Cop City.\" The event was just the latest mass demonstration in over two years of resistance against the construction of a vast police training facility, known as Cop City, over hundreds of acres of Atlanta's forest land.\n\nCops reacted to the day of action by attacking a slow-moving, peaceful march with tear gas and rubber bullets, just the latest reminder of why the compound, designed to further militarized counterinsurgency policing, should never be built.\n\nOrganizers were clear from the start: The protest activities - as had been agreed on in hourslong meetings in the prior days - would not involve property damage to construction vehicles at the site of the planned police facility. The tactic had been tried before, when a small amount of vandalism during a March day of action led to indiscriminate arrests and overreaching state domestic terrorism charges against 42 activists.\n\nMonday's participants planned simply to march, carrying banners and giant handmade puppets, to the Cop City construction area in the Weelaunee Forest, where they would plant nearly 100 saplings on cleared forest land.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nSoon after the march turned onto a road with almost no traffic on it, lines of cops in riot gear amassed to block demonstrators' route to the forest. Dozens of police vehicles swarmed the area, including an armored urban tank dubbed \"the Beast.\" As the marchers pushed slowly forward, the police moved in with shields and batons, shooting rubber bullets and launching flash-bang grenades and tear-gas canisters at the tightly packed group. Clouds of tear gas rolled over dozens of nearby, clearly identified journalists, myself included.\n\nThe protesters stayed in formation; they turned and marched back to their starting point, with a handful of activists hurriedly planting the tree saplings along the roadside.\n\nJournalists and protesters move away from a cloud of tear gas thrown by Georgia law enforcement personnel in Atlanta on Nov. 13, 2023.\n\nNow deep into its second year of organized, multifaceted resistance, the movement to stop Cop City and defend the Atlanta forest has again and again brought to glaring light the old lie: that police can be trusted to respect civil rights.\n\n\"Despite numerous stated commitments from religious leaders and city officials to honor the right to protest, armed riot police terrorized the crowd with tear gas grenades, attack dogs, clubs and ballistic shields,\" said the Block Cop City organizers in a statement following the march.\n\nThe Cop City project was, of course, not blocked on Monday, but the abolitionist, environmentalist movement once again proved its staying power against aggressive police repression. Since its inception, activists opposing the $90 million police training facility have been attacked by police, mass arrested, and, in the intolerable case of Manuel \"Tortuguita\" Terán, riddled with 57 police bullets and killed.\n\nRead our complete coverage\n\nProtesters face felonies for handing out flyers and fundraising for camping supplies. The government explicitly deemed opposition to Cop City a criminal enterprise when, in September, it announced racketeering charges against 61 activists, most of whom already face state domestic terror charges, for typical social justice activities like information sharing and mutual aid organizing. One such defendant, Indigenous activist Victor Puertas, was handed over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and remains in detention facing deportation in addition to the egregious criminal charges.\n\nMeanwhile, an activist effort to get a public vote on Cop City on the recent November ballot had garnered sufficient signatures from the public - over 100,000 of them - but was obstructed by the city government in a blatant assault on democratic processes.\n\nFollowing Monday's demonstration, Atlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum held a press briefing to defend the cops' use of tear gas and other weapons. He claimed the protesters were \"prepared to do harm\" and pointed to a line of gardening tools - dibbles specifically - police had taken from the march site. These were, of course, the tools activists were using to plant saplings.\n\n\"People were really ready to plant trees,\" said an organizer who helped bring 75 oak seedlings, 25 pines, and elderberry cuttings to the event. (She asked to remain anonymous for fear of police harassment.) \"First it was terrorism if you had muddy clothes,\" Sam, a Texas-based organizer with the Austin Weelaunee Defense Society who asked for anonymity, told me. Police had used mud on the shoes of activists, in a forest, to justify the March arrests for domestic terrorism . \"Now planting shovels are weapons. What's next? Midnight raids for owners of muck boots?\"\n\nA sign is discarded by a protester after tear gas was deployed by police during the Block Cop City day of action on Nov. 13, 2023, in Atlanta. (AP Photo/Mike Stewart)\n\nDespite the blunt, repressive instruments deployed by police, those fighting to defend the forest have never stopped. Instead, they adapted and shifted tactics. None of the activists I spoke to on Monday, many with skin and eyes still burning from tear gas, felt the march was a failure. They are already planning for their next steps.\n\nA campaign, Uncover Cop City , is underway to put public pressure on insurance companies Nationwide and Accident Fund to end their subsidiaries' liability contracts with the Atlanta Police Foundation, the corporate-backed nonprofit behind Cop City. Without the insurance contracts, Cop City's construction is dead in the water. Previous direct targeting of companies involved in the project have led several contractors to drop out.\n\n\"People are determined to see this struggle through to the end,\" May Johnson, a resident of the neighborhood next to the forest imperiled by Cop City who has been active in the movement since its beginning, told me. \"The movement is quick to adapt its strategies and persist despite repression.\"\n\nThe fight to defend the forest matters on its own terms for those living nearby. The forest's destruction, air and noise pollution, flooding risks, and the considerable increase in police presence it will bring is a threat to the adjacent majority Black and low-income neighborhood. The cab driver who drove me to the protest staging ground, a Black lifelong Atlanta resident, was unequivocal. \"Nobody wants that thing built,\" he said. My Airbnb host opposes Cop City; his father grew up in the neighborhood on the forest's edge.\n\nThe widespread opposition is how a small group of activists, in a matter of weeks, collected 100,000-plus signatures from locals who wanted a chance to vote down the project through a ballot measure.\n\nProtesters collide with a police line during a Block Cop City demonstration in opposition to a new police training center on Nov. 13, 2023, in Atlanta.\n\nIt's no secret that public funds into training police in urban warfare will not serve public safety. Cop City is an invitation for corporations and investors to see Atlanta as an attractive hub, a city with its own mini city for training defenders of private property. Greater funding and more training for police has not led to fewer police killings and less racist police violence. As Atlanta community organizer Kamau Franklin noted in a rousing speech prior to Monday's march, \"In 2022, police killed more people than ever.\"\n\nOrganizers insist on seeing beyond the local: Protests like Monday's are intended to invite out-of-state participants. The old and racist canard of \"outside agitators,\" peddled by Atlanta law enforcement and other officials since Stop Cop City began, falls flat against a locally led effort that wins national and international support.\n\n\"While there are hundreds of locals here, there are many who have come in solidarity,\" Block Cop City organizer Sam Beard, an environmental activist from Chicago, told the assembled protesters on Monday. \"We have descended into Atlanta because a call was made. And front-line activists in this struggle said, 'We need your help.' And we said, 'We've got you.'\"\n\nThe crowd roared with applause.\n\nThe Block Cop City march in Gresham Park in Atlanta on Nov. 13, 2023.\n\nIn an era of mass movements crushed swiftly and violently, the persistence of the fight for the Atlanta forest - even if relatively small in size - demands attention from those of us interested in forms of resilient resistance. It is consistent proof that anti-racist, environmental, Indigenous, and class-based battles can and must intersect.\n\nChants of \"free, free Palestine\" reverberating throughout the march made clear that Stop Cop City participants see their struggle over the forest acreage outside Atlanta as one among many fights to see land and territory liberated, rather than violently bordered and occupied.\n\n\"We've made the connections between the police, militarized complex, and international policing,\" Franklin told the gathered crowd. \"The murderous tactics of the Israeli police and military against the Palestinians. We've made those connections.\"\n\nTortuguita's father, Joel Paez, addressed the crowd, too, along with Belkis Terán, the late forest defender's mother. \"We know why we're here.\" Paez, who has regularly spoken out with fervor against Cop City since Tortuguita's killing, told the protesters. \"Do what you have to do.\"\n\nWithin an hour of his speech, and within a mile of where his child was gunned down by police, cops beat slow-marching protesters and tear-gassed journalists.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Atlanta Cop City Protesters Charged With Domestic Terror for Having Mud on Their Shoes\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe police's guilt-by-association allegations aren't designed to get convictions, but to break up a movement.\n\nEnvironmental activists hold a rally and a march through the Atlanta forest that is scheduled to be developed as a police training center, on March 4, 2023, in Atlanta.\n\nIn an aggressive and indiscriminate arrest sweep on Sunday, police stormed a music festival held in the Atlanta forest by activists protesting Cop City, a vast police training facility under construction atop forestland. Twenty-three of the activists arrested in the raid now face domestic terrorism charges for their participation in the Defend the Atlanta Forest movement.\n\nThe protesters are alleged to have participated in acts of vandalism and arson at a Cop City construction site over a mile away from the music festival location and over an hour before the arrest raid took place. They have all been charged under Georgia's domestic terror statute, though none of the arrest warrants tie any of the defendants directly to any illegal acts.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThe probable cause stated in the warrants against the activists is extremely weak. Police cited arrestees having mud on their shoes - in a forest. The warrants alleged they had written a legal support phone number on their arms, as is common during mass protests. And, in a few cases, police alleged protesters were holding shields - hardly proof of illegal activity - which a number of defendants even deny.\n\nThis is just the latest incident of law enforcement and prosecutorial overreach against the abolitionist, environmentalist movement in Atlanta, an absurd attempt to establish guilt by association, as the flimsy arrest warrants make clear.\n\nAt a hearing for arrestees on Tuesday, 22 activists were denied bond outright. One defendant, a Georgia-based attorney who was arrested while acting as a designated legal observer for the National Lawyers Guild during Sunday's events, was released on $5,000 bond.\n\n\"We haven't seen a charge for arson or interference with government property,\" said Eli Bennett, the attorney for several defendants, describing the arrest warrants during Tuesday's bond hearing. \"The state has no evidence,\" he said, adding that Georgia's domestic terrorism statute is \"laughably unconstitutional.\"\n\nA total of 42 participants in the Stop Cop City struggle now face state domestic terror charges, as 19 individuals were previously hit with the same charges in the last two months on equally weak grounds. At the end of January, during a multi-agency police raid on the forest encampment, cops shot dead 26-year-old Manuel \"Tortuguita\" Terán, marking a grim escalation in repression against a movement that has shown impressive resilience in its two years of mobilizing against Cop City.\n\nNow, on the most tenuous claims of vicarious liability, multiple forest defenders face up to 35 years in prison if found guilty of domestic terrorism.\n\n\"It's collective punishment. The police are trying to establish a de-facto norm that anyone who associates with a political movement will be attacked and charged for the actions of any other supporter of that movement,\" said Marlon Kautz, an Atlanta-based organizer with the Atlanta Solidarity Fund, which provides bail funds and legal support to protesters targeted for involvement in social movements, including against Cop City.\n\n\"As a law enforcement strategy, it's utterly incompetent and ignorant of how the law works. But as a strategy for repressing a political movement it makes a lot of sense,\" Kautz told me. \"Convincing activists and prospective activists that they will be held criminally responsible for the actions of other supporters of their movement can have the effect of pitting activists against each other.\"\n\nThe music festival on Sunday, where the arrests took place, marked the beginning of an ongoing \" week of action \" organized by forest defenders. In line with the movement's diverse deployment of tactics over the last two years, its semiregular weeks of action involve peaceful rallies, arts and music events, child-friendly educational and cultural activities in the forest, and Indigenous-led knowledge sharing and prayer, alongside targeted protests and direct actions against Cop City's supporters and funders.\n\n\"Roughly 1,500 people attended over the weekend; to dance, to commune, and to take a stand against Cop City,\" organizers of the music festival, the Sonic Defense Committee, told me. \"There is no excuse for the police violence that festival attendees were subjected to.\"\n\nThe week of action brought together locals and supporters from around the country and world to raise awareness of the Atlanta forest's importance and Cop City's profound threat - which reaches far beyond the state of Georgia.\n\nThe $90 million training center aims to train cops in militarized urban warfare. The Atlanta Police Department told the Atlanta City Council that it intends to recruit 43 percent of the planned facility's trainees from out-of-state police departments. Numerous multinational corporations, including Coca-Cola and Bank of America, are funding the project.\n\nThere's a certain irony, then, that in statements on Sunday's arrests, Atlanta police officials have made a point of blaming \"outside agitators\" for taking up militant action. Out of 44 people originally detained in Sunday's forest raid, the 11 people released without charge all had Atlanta addresses. Twenty-one of the 23 activists charged with domestic terrorism are from out of state.\n\nRelated The Crackdown on Cop City Protesters Is So Brutal Because of the Movement's Success\n\nBennett, the defense attorney, noted during Tuesday's bond hearing that the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, the agency responsible for the domestic terrorism charges, appeared to \"split detainees up into local people and out of towners.\" He told the court, \"The right to freedom of association does not stop at state lines.\"\n\nThat the fight against Cop City, like the encampments at Standing Rock before it, has drawn supporters from far afield is a testament to its strength and a growing understanding that the anti-racist, environmentalist struggle is a shared, international one. Meanwhile, the tired \"outside agitator\" trope has long been used to divide social justice movements and was popular among segregationists attempting to discredit historic anti-racist struggles. As Martin Luther King Jr. said, \"Never again can we afford to live with the narrow, provincial 'outside agitator' idea.\"\n\nRead our complete coverage The People vs. Cop City\n\nRead our complete coverage\n\n\"Think of the freedom riders,\" said Lauren Regan, executive director of the Civil Liberties Defense Center, which is working with numerous Atlanta arrestees. \"If people didn't travel to Southern states from all around the country during the civil rights struggle, this country might have had a very different history,\" she told me. \"The civil rights struggle impacted the entire country and the world - outside scrutiny, attention, and action forced change. Cop City also impacts everyone. The forced construction sets dangerous precedent on many levels, particularly in the aftermath of the Black Lives Matter uprisings and the national call to focus more on community needs and root causes and less on militarized police who are terrorizing many people in this country.\"\n\nRegan called Georgia's deployment of the \"outside agitator\" trope \"deplorable and ignorant of our history.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a diverse, multiracial collective of Atlanta residents have been organizing tirelessly against Cop City since it was first proposed and will continue leading the fight on the ground. Hundreds of people remain in the forest as the \"week of action\" continues.\n\n\"As the movement grows and city and state officials refuse to see the reality of what they are dealing with, their own authority is being brought into question,\" noted a statement from the Sonic Defense Committee, released on Wednesday. \"If they are not careful, the stakes of the movement will soon exceed the bounds of the forest and Cop City. In fact, that process may already have begun.\"\n\nCorrection: March 9, 2023 This story has been updated to say that 19, not 18, arrestees were previously indicted on domestic terror charges, bringing the total to 42.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

After months in prison, Tennenbaum spoke to Jacobin about Georgia's crackdown on civil liberties.\n\nActivists hold a rally and a march through the Weelaunee Forest on March 4, 2023, in Atlanta, Georgia. (Andrew Lichtenstein / Corbis via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nOn January 18, Georgia State Patrol troopers murdered Manuel Esteban Paez Terán, a nonbinary Afro-Venezuelan activist who went by the name \"Tortuguita.\" An independent autopsy concluded that Tortuguita had been shot more than a dozen times while they were sitting cross-legged with their hands up and their palms facing their body. Months later, the state's autopsy established the precise number of shots, fifty-seven, and confirmed another key finding from the independent autopsy: Tortuguita had not fired a gun, as officers claimed. Their death was ruled a homicide.\n\nTortuguita's killing is the most horrifying event to come out of the state's suppression of the Stop Cop City movement, which has occupied the Weelaunee Forest in southeast Atlanta since late 2021 to protest a $90 million police training facility and a new movie studio, Blackhall, the city plans to build there. The facility earned the nickname \"Cop City\" because it is set to include a mock city block, where police could hone militarized tactics to deploy against a city that activists say is already the nation's most surveilled .\n\nAs of this summer, the state has charged forty-two protesters with domestic terrorism and three Atlanta Solidarity Fund organizers with money laundering. In most cases, the evidence was comically flimsy: the protesters had mud on their clothes, apparently proof that they had vandalized construction equipment, and the solidarity fund had provided reimbursements for \"totes,\" \"forest cleanup,\" and \"yard signs,\" supposedly code for unspecified illegal items.\n\nIn April, Stop Cop City activist Charley Tennenbaum was distributing flyers in the neighborhood of Jonathan Salcedo, an officer involved in Tortuguita's murder. When police stopped Tennenbaum (who is nonbinary), they say they had no idea that they were about to be thrown in jail, interviewed by the FBI, and charged with felony intimidation of a police officer and stalking - all for putting up flyers.\n\nAfter a two-and-a-half-month incarceration that included stretches in twenty-four-hour isolation, Tennenbaum is currently out of jail and spoke to Jacobin assistant editor Tadhg Larabee about disenfranchisement in Atlanta, fighting back against the climate crisis, the free speech implications of their case, and the potential for them to serve up to twenty years in prison if convicted.\n\nWhat drew you to the Stop Cop City movement?\n\nAtlanta has been my home for the last decade. When this movement was beginning, it interested me because I saw just how many intersecting institutions and issues were coming together to create this perfect storm. You have stolen Muscogee land that was then a plantation, and that was then the Old Atlanta Prison Farm. And now they're trying to make that into Cop City and Blackhall Studios.\n\nThese two megaprojects are threatening this area of land, which was recognized through city government and the parks and recreation department as a green space that was supposed to remain dedicated as such. It's land that is immediately surrounded by a historically black, poor, and working-class neighborhood. Because this area is in unincorporated DeKalb County, it's not represented on the city council. They don't even get to have a say in this.\n\nWith climate change, the Weelaunee Forest is also essential ecological infrastructure. That area floods badly already. If the trees are removed, it will flood even more. If you look at future climate change migration models, Atlanta is one of the main places in the South where people are going to go. So what we do now really matters not just right now, but for the future of Atlanta.\n\nWhat do you think that this massive investment in policing, if completed, would mean for the residents of the surrounding area and Atlanta more broadly?\n\nThis police training facility, otherwise known as Cop City, will have a fake apartment complex, a fake grocery store, a fake convenience store, a fake gas station - replicas of the spaces where many of us live and interact with each other in the city and on the streets. And this facility is designed to meet people who are trying to exercise their right to those streets in a way that is increasingly militarized and threatening, with police brutality already on the rise.\n\nCop City is a couple miles south of a university. And it's in an extremely black lower- and middle-income area. That's who they're targeting with this immediate presence.\n\nIf you look at Atlanta more broadly, this is very connected with what's happening in Buckhead in north Atlanta, a much higher-income neighborhood. In the past, when there were people on the streets demanding change, the people of Buckhead got scared, and so they've been threatening to secede from Atlanta. Part of Atlanta mayor Andre Dickens's motivation to push for Cop City is to convince Buckhead to stay in Atlanta, because Buckhead residents are worried about crime and are incredibly important to the tax base.\n\nSo the project is not only doubling down on oppression, but also serving the interests of the higher class. At the same time, it serves private interests, as you see with the Atlanta Police Foundation, a powerful nonprofit that supports the Atlanta Police Department with donations from Delta Air Lines, Home Depot, Wells Fargo, and other large corporate sponsors. The Stop Cop City movement and the broader Defend Weelaunee Forest movement have really exposed the major forces that decide how we live together in cities - I think it's important that we continue winning, because so much is at stake in Atlanta.\n\nTalk about the specific circumstances of your arrest. What happened?\n\nOn April 28, two friends and I were on our way to go camping, and we had flyers to put in Jonathan Salcedo's neighborhood to try to raise awareness for what he did on January 18, when he was involved in killing Tortuguita.\n\nWe were avoiding confrontation. My friend was driving, I was flyering, and our other friend chose nonparticipation. It was the middle of the day, we weren't hiding, and I was doing my best to not break the law. Opening a mailbox is a felony, but putting things on the exterior of a mailbox is not illegal - so we did not open any mailboxes. We committed no acts of aggression. We had a fun time. We were just riding around, singing songs. It was a beautiful day.\n\nWhen we were leaving town, an officer recognized our van, and we were detained for about an hour. The cops were on the fence about what action they wanted to take with us; one cop was like, I can understand how it's [protected by the] First Amendment to speak about things like this, but you can't do that in a neighborhood. I think that's false - you can exercise your First Amendment rights in a neighborhood.\n\nThen, one of the police officers got off the phone and said that the FBI wanted to talk to us, so we were being arrested. It was the FBI's decision ultimately to bring us in.\n\nWe went through the intake process. We tried to settle in for what we knew was about to begin, but you can never really know. After we were held separately for a long time, I was asked to come to this other room where there was an FBI and a Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent. They did not identify themselves until I asked who they were. They wanted an interview with me.\n\nThe FBI agent tried to be intimidating, saying that I was facing serious charges. He would not explain what those charges were. And then he asked for my consent for an interview. I pointed out that I had no lawyer there, so I absolutely had zero interest in an interview. And then it was over.\n\nAt that point, it was unclear what was going to happen. We were still hopeful that it was going to be a quick turnaround.\n\nThen I was brought to an isolation room, and it was not explained why. It was around midnight at this point; we were arrested around 4:30 p.m. When I woke up the next morning, it sunk in that I was in isolation. Normal isolation is twenty-three-hour lockdown with one hour of access to a kiosk, a phone, and socialization. But for some reason I was put in double isolation, which is twenty-four-hour lockdown, with twenty-four-hour lights. At no point did I resist arrest, and I complied with the medical intake requirements. I felt very targeted. As the days went by, no one would really give me information.\n\nI was trying to file a grievance, because the Bartow County Jail's inmate handbook says that if an inmate is in an area without access to a kiosk, then the inmate can request a paper grievance form from the guard on shift. When I asked for this form, the guard said she didn't have to do that. After I went to medical, because I was having some health problems while I was in isolation, the guard took pity on me and looked it up and there was nothing entered in the system as to the reason for my being put in isolation. Isn't that funny?\n\nThat Monday was our bond hearing, and we were all denied bond very quickly. The grounds for being granted bond were not even discussed; the magistrate judge just kicked the case up to the superior court level. I got sent back to isolation, with no information about when I would be getting released from there, if at all, which was very hard.\n\nEventually, I was brought into the general population. That meant that I had access to not only my support crew on the outside, but to people on the inside and much better living conditions, which made my time there more endurable. I did end up submitting a grievance on the kiosk asking why I was put in double isolation. Here's what I was told: \"The deputies were told to keep you separate from your codefendants. We were waiting until we were told it was all clear for you and your codefendants to be populated out of administrative segregation. They were just following orders.\"\n\nAdministrative segregation is typically only for inmates who have done something violent; we could have all been put in the general population and kept separate. I will be bringing that up in my countersuit, because I think that that is cruel and unusual punishment, and there's no justification that they can provide for why that was at all necessary.\n\nThe second bond hearing at the superior court level was then held on May 17, and my two codefendants were granted bond. I was not. State prosecutor John Fowler seemed very motivated to make me into a boogeyman, talking about the \"dark web\" and how I got reimbursed for some art supplies, which they portrayed as very dangerous.\n\nIn the state of Georgia, the rules of evidence don't apply to bond hearings. So prosecutors can say things that are verifiably not true, as long as they string together a scary-sounding story. In particular, they claimed that Defend the Atlanta Forest is designated by the Department of Homeland Security as a domestic violent extremist organization. But the Department of Homeland Security has said - on paper, twice - that they've not designated it in any way.\n\nThat was the same claim cited in the warrant to raid the Atlanta Solidarity Fund, which led to three arrests, right?\n\nExactly right. This lie is still being passed around in a lot of the legal dealings that the state uses to bring politically motivated oppression down on the movement, which does not give me confidence in funding [the state's law enforcement] more. This sort of behavior is exactly why we don't want to fund Cop City.\n\nIts budget, which was originally going to be $60 million, is now apparently going to be $97 million. That could be going toward providing housing, access to food, better education, job security, and medical care. There are so many alternatives that we could be funding with that money.\n\nThe charge they eventually brought against you was \"felony intimidation of an officer of the state.\" What do you think the free speech implications are of construing flyering as felony intimidation?\n\nIt's sort of funny, because at first the charge was \"felony, statute pending.\" They wanted to get me with something, but they didn't know what. And then it was \"felony intimidation of an officer of the court.\" But Salcedo is not a court officer; he's a Georgia State Patrol trooper. They had filed under the wrong statute. So they landed on what it is now, which is \"intimidation of a police officer.\" That carries a twenty-year maximum prison sentence.\n\nTo me, this is an attempt to criminalize something that should undeniably be a right: raising awareness about things that we believe are wrong and deserve to be handled in a more public forum, so that we have a better chance of getting justice.\n\nWhen you are close to police brutality, it motivates you to fight, because you know that it could happen to anyone. And this violence is, of course, falling along classic lines of oppression. Tortuguita was Afro-Venezuelan. If an increasingly militarized police state can commit acts of brutality like they did on January 18 and it goes unchallenged, then that kind of oppression grows. This is a time, not just for Atlanta, but for anyone who stands to benefit or be harmed by these institutions, to act.\n\nThe Supreme Court case New York Times Co. v. Sullivan clearly allows for public, heated debate concerning government officials. I strongly believe that I'm entirely within my First Amendment rights to be critiquing what those state patrol troopers did. It's ironic that I am raising awareness about an injustice - murder - and yet I'm now the one facing twenty years in prison.\n\nI'd also like to talk about the domestic terrorism charges that forty-two other protesters are facing. In effect, they criminalize certain actions simply because they occurred at a protest, which seems to raise obvious free speech issues.\n\nGeorgia expanded its domestic terrorism law in 2017, after Dylann Roof murdered nine members of a black church in South Carolina. And now, what was originally designed with the outwardly facing intention of protecting marginalized people is being used to further oppress marginalized people.\n\nLook at who's facing these domestic terrorism charges: by and large, we're the kind of people who live on the margins. A lot of us are queer, a lot of us are trans, a lot of us are coming from different communities of color.\n\nWe all are aware that we live in one of the most important times in human history, and the choices that we make can change that path that we're on. Climate collapse is happening right now. Some people have succumbed to not just climate denial, but climate nihilism: the belief that we can't change anything. I don't think that's the case. Our movement is trying to build something different, and we need to be able to use our freedom of speech when we disagree with the state's actions.\n\nMy protest was perfectly legal. What I'm wondering - and what I'd like to ask Prosecutor Fowler or anyone in the FBI - is how I'm supposed to engage in my civil duty to disagree with my elected officials if exercising my legal rights is going to be treated as illegal.\n\nI have been a registered voter in Atlanta since 2014, and I think that it's in the state's interest to recognize that freedom of speech is absolutely to be protected and defended.\n\nRight now, the citizens of Atlanta are organizing a petition to put a referendum on the next election's ballot about whether Cop City should go forward. It seems like the state is trying to preemptively shut that down with a federal court filing that refers to the referendum campaign as \"invalid.\" How do you think that fits into their broader strategy of repression?\n\nThe strategy of repression is the phrase here. Whenever there's been an arrest, the only thing more absurd than it is the next thing that happens - for example, going from charges of criminal trespassing in a public park to allegations of domestic terrorism in the span of half a year. Now, forty-two people are facing domestic terrorism charges and upward of sixty or seventy are facing other charges.\n\nThe referendum campaign has been really wild. Originally, they asked for seventy thousand signatures from people who were registered as Atlanta voters during the previous election cycle. If they weren't registered but could qualify as a voter, their signatures didn't count. In addition to that, because Cop City and the Weelaunee Forest are surrounded by unincorporated DeKalb County, local residents don't get to participate in the City of Atlanta referendum. There are many layers of exclusion.\n\nThe figure of seventy thousand signatures represents 15 percent of Atlanta registered voters. When Andre Dickens was elected mayor during the 2021 election cycle, he still only got the votes of around 11 percent of Atlanta registered voters. Before our referendum can even get on the ballot, we need to get the support of more people than he did. Seeing those numbers relative to each other shows that this is an extremely absurd standard in addition to being exclusionary of DeKalb [County].\n\nFederal courts have granted us a deadline extension and ruled that DeKalb County residents should be able to collect signatures, although the city is fighting both these decisions in court. It seems like even if we hit the seventy thousand threshold, the city will try to stop the referendum from appearing on the ballot.\n\nAgain, the question is, how are we supposed to engage in protected civil dissent when this is how it is treated?\n\nWhat's next for your defense?\n\nOf course, I want the charges to be dropped. But if I am indicted and go to trial, I believe that we would win. And that would be a wild gift - an opportunity to contribute to the modern case law around exercising First Amendment rights.\n\nI enjoy witnessing the state disagreeing with itself as to how these charges are being handled - watching the DeKalb County [district attorney] drop out of their portion of the forty-two domestic terrorism charges and say that all the domestic terrorism charges should be dropped. On the same day, the head of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation stepped down. That's powerful.\n\nIt would be great if my charges were dropped, but if I go to trial, then I'll win. In either case, I'm countersuing.\n\nCharley Tennenbaum is a queer and trans nonbinary activist in Atlanta.\n\nTadhg Larabee is an assistant editor at Jacobin .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

The outcome will set a precedent for the political future, with implications well beyond the city itself.\n\nActivists participate in a protest against Cop City on March 9, 2023, in New York City.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nAtlanta residents are awaiting a court decision on whether they will be allowed to vote on the construction of a massive new police training facility, dubbed \"Cop City.\" The $110 million Atlanta Public Safety Training Center would draw police trainees from across the country and contain an entire mock city, a model strikingly similar to the Israeli military's \" mini-Gaza \" used to train Israeli troops for urban combat.\n\nAtlanta's Cop City was proposed after the 2020 George Floyd uprising, the mass protest movement sparked by the murder of George Floyd by then officer Derek Chauvin in Minneapolis, MN, and other instances of racist police violence. As with earlier waves of Black Lives Matter protests, 2020 led to some policing reforms - many imposed by voters through ballot initiatives - but in general, police institutions responded to the movement by preparing for war. Just over a year after George Floyd took his last breath, the Atlanta city council voted to green-light Cop City.\n\nFrom the moment it was announced, many Atlanta residents have fought bitterly to stop Cop City, while the city government is doing its best to build it anyway. The effort to ram Cop City past public opposition is dovetailing with antidemocratic measures and increasingly draconian anti-protest laws across the country, in a bipartisan spiral toward authoritarianism that we ignore at our peril.\n\nIt is becoming increasingly obvious that the struggle against authoritarianism doesn't always revolve around far-right Republicans. In urban centers like Atlanta - think also of recent police responses to protests in New York , Los Angeles , Chicago , and Minneapolis - Democrats are paving the way to the society far-right Republicans dream of, where decisions are made by and for those already in power and the police are armed and ready to keep everyone in their place.\n\nIn June 2021, Atlanta city councilmember Joyce Sheperd introduced Ordinance 21-O-0637 proposing to lease 381 acres of publicly owned forest to the Atlanta Police Foundation for the construction of Cop City. The facility itself would be built on eighty-five acres of clear-cut land in the Weelaunee Forest, adjacent to a majority-black area of Atlanta. Dozens of cop cities have been built or are under construction since the George Floyd uprising, but Atlanta's would be the flagship - the largest and most public-facing police urban warfare training center in the United States.\n\nThe fight to prevent construction brought together people of all stripes, including anti-racists and opponents of militarized policing, environmentalists sounding the alarm about the potentially disastrous climate impacts of destroying so much of Atlanta's green space, and residents who see Cop City as part of rampant gentrification or who simply think taxpayer money could be better spent on underfunded public services. Local activists mobilized demonstrations, direct actions at construction sites, a network of forest encampments, and a nationwide solidarity campaign.\n\nIn June 2023, after two years of escalating protests and repression, the Atlanta City Council met to vote on public funding for Cop City's construction. Residents again packed city hall, with public comments lasting for over thirteen hours, the vast majority dead set against the project. Once again, the city council ignored its constituents and voted to appropriate tens of millions of tax dollars to build Cop City.\n\nThe next day, Atlantans turned to a more formal type of public comment, one with some teeth - a referendum campaign to repeal the 2021 ordinance leasing land to the Atlanta Police Foundation. It would be the first time a popular referendum (meaning a vote on a policy instead of a politician) has been used in Atlanta.\n\nOne could be forgiven for expecting that the response to a proposed referendum on an ordinance supported by the mayor and twice approved by the city council would be a public awareness campaign to persuade residents that Cop City is in fact a good thing. That's how democracy is supposed to work, right? Instead, the city government threw up every roadblock they could to prevent a popular vote.\n\nThe first version of the petition was rejected on a technicality; when it was resubmitted and eventually accepted, the city of Atlanta sued both to restrict signature collectors to Atlanta residents and to invalidate the petition altogether, saying that it was unconstitutional in Georgia. A district judge kicked the can on the second objection, saying it would get adjudicated if the referendum were to make the ballot. On the first question, he ruled that anyone could circulate the referendum petition, and he extended the sixty-day deadline to submit signatures.\n\nBut when the campaign submitted their 116,000 signatures by the new deadline - significantly more than all votes cast in Atlanta's last mayoral election and almost double the amount required to get on the ballot - the city rejected them on the grounds that the campaign had missed the original deadline, arguing that since the lawsuit was being appealed, the new deadline was false. That appeal is currently with the Eleventh Circuit.\n\nOn top of this, the City Council voted to adopt signature-matching procedures , which experts criticize as riven with problems that result in the exclusion of marginalized people. But that procedure only kicks in if the process is allowed to proceed. As it stands, 116,000 signatures sit in boxes and the referendum is at a standstill while construction of Cop City moves forward.\n\nSwitching out mayors and city council members - all Democrats in the first place - has had no effect. After the 2021 vote to lease land for Cop City, many longtime city councilmembers, including Sheperd, were ousted by a slate of younger Democrats running on progressive platforms. Yet the 2023 vote to fund Cop City was almost identical to the 2021 vote to lease it (11-4 and 10-4, respectively). Likewise, the mayor who initially supported Cop City, Keisha Lance Bottoms, was replaced with Andre Dickens, who had previously signaled some willingness to stand up to police. Since taking office, however, Dickens has overseen the bureaucratic suppression of the referendum and brutal police repression of protesters.\n\nNot only has changing Democratic representatives been unsuccessful in aligning the city with its constituents on this issue, but the tactics that Atlanta Democrats are using against the Cop City referendum have directly mirrored Republican attacks on the direct vote elsewhere.\n\nBallot initiatives and referendums are the only large-scale means of direct legislation we have, and as such are a good barometer for democratic institutions. Where the local party in power is uncomfortable with people having a direct say in legislation, it's a good bet that those politicians aren't governing in most people's best interests. That's because when voters are allowed to legislate for themselves, they tend to agree on a lot of core issues.\n\nFor example, every single state initiative to raise the minimum wage has passed going back to 1996, with an average of 60 percent support in red and blue states alike. During Barack Obama's presidency, Republicans made opposition to Medicaid expansion a pillar of their platform, but when voters have petitioned to put the expansion on the ballot in Republican states, it has passed almost every time. Abortion is supposed to be the polarizing issue par excellence, but all seven votes on abortion rights or bans since the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision have gone for reproductive freedom (four initiatives to protect abortion rights passed, while three to ban abortion failed).\n\nAs a decision-making mechanism, ballot initiatives themselves are highly popular, and voters from both parties are acutely hostile to legislators trying to take away the direct vote. So when state or local governments want to do just that - typically connected to an initiative that is popular with voters but unpopular with party leaders - they usually try to avoid appearing as though they're simply against democracy. Instead, they tend to take a more subtle, death-by-a-thousand-papercuts approach - legislation that makes the process more expensive and less accessible, bad-faith bureaucratic obstacles, overly burdensome technicalities, and lengthy court challenges.\n\nSome of the most common methods state and local governments use to weaken citizen initiatives have been trying to increase the winning percentage it takes to pass initiatives; upping the number or widening the geographic distribution of signatures required (which hikes up costs for campaigns); arbitrarily changing deadlines and paperwork requirements; imposing \"single-subject\" rules that can sound like common sense but in practice enable courts to toss initiatives by claiming they relate to more than one thing; imposing divisive or misleading ballot language; sponsoring competing measures meant to confuse voters; and so on.\n\nWhen all else fails, legislators have resorted to gutting initiatives they oppose through bills that undo the intended effect, and courts have overcome popular citizen initiatives by ruling them unconstitutional, sometimes on absurd technicalities . In rare cases, often involving the carceral system, government agencies have simply refused to comply. This is where the role of the police comes into focus. When push comes to shove, who is going to enforce the rules, and who do the enforcers answer to?\n\nAround the country, wherever ballot initiatives are being used to pass policy that the majority wants but the ruling party opposes, state and local governments are resorting to rigging the game to prevent a popular vote. That's exactly what we're seeing in Atlanta. In many instances, initiative campaigns have managed to overcome gerrymandered rules to win. Whether or not this is possible in the future may come down to how barefaced the police can be in suppressing dissent.\n\nThe job of police is to enforce the status quo, and a deeply unequal status quo requires heavy-handed enforcement. Historically, the institution of police was imported from England, where constables were used to defend the rule of monarchy against the masses since the thirteenth century. A similar practice developed in the seventeenth century via deputized bands of armed white men enforcing the system of slavery in the American and Caribbean colonies.\n\nThe first formal police departments in the United States were the ruling class's response to abolitionist calls for rebellion. Modern policing did not develop to defend everyday people from criminals, but to protect the beneficiaries of a racialized and exploitative system from those who wanted to change that system.\n\nToday reasonable people might disagree about the ideal role of policing on the road to a more just society. But we should all agree that to the extent police exist, they should be accountable to the communities they police, not just to the people in power. It would be difficult to overstate the danger that militarized police, armed with the weapons , tactics , and attitude of war, pose not just to the safety of our communities, but to any chance we might have of democratizing the US political and economic systems.\n\nIt is no accident that Cop City emerged in reaction to the 2020 racial justice uprising, itself a popular rejoinder to racist police violence. During that moment, police brutalized protesters and attacked journalists with impunity. The Department of Homeland Security even admitted to using unmarked vans to kidnap activists at gunpoint. Cop City was proposed in the aftermath of these events to train police how to better operate as though they are an occupying force in hostile terrain of a majority-black city.\n\nOne of Cop City's prime inspirations, the Israeli military's \" mini Gaza ,\" speaks volumes. It's hard to find a single person, whatever their stance on Israel and Palestine might be, who wants cops to police their neighborhood the way Israeli soldiers operate in Gaza. Supporters of militarized policing implicitly understand that those guns will be pointed at other kinds of people in other places.\n\nIn January, 2023, as if to leave no doubt about the type of policing Cop City would supercharge, Atlanta police raided the Stop Cop City protest encampment, shooting activist Manuel \" Tortuguita \" Paez Terán at least fourteen times in the process, killing them on the spot. Police claimed Tortuguita had a weapon and fired on police, but recordings from the raid indicate police likely shot at each other by accident, while the district attorney has refused to make forensic evidence public.\n\nLater that year, just as the referendum campaign was gaining steam, Atlanta police arrested dozens of protesters for domestic terrorism, racketeering , and other felonies carrying twenty-year prison sentences or more. Then they arrested three people running the Atlanta Solidarity Fund, which helped provide bail for Stop Cop City activists.\n\nThe targeting of support activities like the bail fund, as well as the outrageousness of some of the charges - terrorism charges for having muddy shoes , felony intimidation for handing out flyers about Tortuguita's murder - make it clear that getting honest convictions is not the priority. These police and prosecutor actions, like recent legislation across the country criminalizing dissent and enabling vigilante violence against protesters, are about breaking the movement.\n\nShortly after the crackdown on activists and supporters, the Atlanta city clerk published the referendum petition online with all signatories' personal information, effectively doxing everyone who wanted a public vote on Cop City. When activists demanded that information be redacted, the city council directed the city clerk to comply, but the clerk has yet to do so. As with obstructions to the referendum, the bureaucracy has a way of fluidly taking the shape of repression. Through it all, organizers on the ground refused to be cowed, and continued to press the fight against Cop City.\n\nThe most direct threat of authoritarianism clearly appears to come from the Republican Party. With the accompanying media parade focusing on two-party candidate elections, it can be all too easy to overlook the ways Democrats in liberal cities are putting pieces in place for the authoritarian transition. The fight to stop Cop City is emblematic of a broader struggle to govern through popular will against a political class that appears increasingly ready to swap out democratic institutions for a police state.\n\nRight-wing Republicans are not the immediate problem in Atlanta, where the ruling Democratic political establishment came to power in the wake of the civil rights movement. But knowingly or not, that Democratic political establishment is laying the far right's groundwork in repressing voting and civil rights to prepare the police for war against their own population.\n\nThis phenomenon is by no means limited to Atlanta, and the impacts of the fight over Cop City will not stay local. Through antidemocratic measures, the criminalization of protest, and the militarization of police, the ruling class is attempting an encirclement maneuver around possibilities for change from below. The more of these battles we lose, the fewer our options become.\n\nBen Case is a researcher, writer, and long-time organizer based in the Rust Belt.

It's reminiscent of conditions in Latin America, where climate protesters' lives are frequently on the line.\n\nLaw enforcement drive past the planned site of a police training facility that activists have nicknamed \"Cop City,\" following the first raid since the death of environmental activist Manuel Esteban Paez Terán near Atlanta, Georgia, on February 6, 2023. (Cheney Orr / AFP via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nWhen Manuel Esteban Paez Terán was shot fifty-seven times and killed by law enforcement officers at Cop City outside Atlanta in January, much of the American environmental movement was stunned.\n\nThe Guardian wrote in its coverage that experts believed the killing of Terán, known as \"Tortuguita,\" was \"'unprecedented' in [the] history of environmental activism.\" Keith Woodhouse, a professor of history at Northwestern University, told Jacobin that it was the first time in American history that law enforcement officers had shot and killed an environmental activist engaged in forest defense.\n\nEven beyond the gratuitously violent killing of a very possibly unarmed twenty-six-year-old, the state's response to the Stop Cop City movement has frequently been framed over the last several months as a chilling escalation of the tactics it is willing to engage in to quash environmental defense - a watershed moment, of sorts, for the US climate movement.\n\nAt the end of May, an Atlanta Police Department SWAT team working in coordination with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation raided a residential home in East Atlanta, arrested three board members of the Atlanta Solidarity Fund, and charged them with money laundering and charity fraud in an apparent attempt to kneecap their efforts to organize legal support for arrested protesters.\n\nThe Atlanta Solidarity Fund's work has been especially vital in recent months as Cop City protesters have been subject to mass arrests and trumped-up charges including domestic terrorism. Several activists are facing up to twenty years in prison for placing flyers on mailboxes in a Bartow County neighborhood. Governor Brian Kemp has warned that \"domestic terrorism will not be tolerated in this state.\" His words have received backing from the Department of Homeland Security, which has listed Cop City protesters alongside mass shooters and violent white supremacists as terror threats facing the country.\n\nTo be clear: only one police officer has been injured in the course of policing, and while police say that officer was wounded by a protester, there's evidence to suggest he may well have been hit by friendly fire. The supposed violence of the Stop Cop City protest pales in comparison to the violence the construction of Cop City will inflict - the destruction of hundreds of acres of forest, the loss of public land, and the expansion of the corporate police state in what is already one of the most surveilled , inequitable cities in the country.\n\nAs the climate crisis intensifies, the question is whether the persecution of climate defenders in the United States will intensify along with it - whether the brazenness and severity of the campaign against the Stop Cop City activists is a preview of what is to come elsewhere.\n\nClimate defenders in the US have long faced threats to their lives and livelihoods. But the intensity of the threats protesters in Atlanta are facing is reminiscent more of the risks climate defenders routinely face in the Global South, where both activists and journalists are routinely jailed and killed in their defense of land and water. Of the 401 human rights defenders killed last year, nearly half were killed defending the climate. Of those, the majority were killed in countries like Colombia, Brazil, Mexico, and Honduras - places where the United States has historically exported policing strategies and devalued life.\n\nNow, as states and corporations race to seize land and accumulate resources, that kind of policing may be coming home.\n\n\"It's been normal for a while that militarized states, whose purpose is the facilitation of capital, are using mechanisms and strategies of counterinsurgency . . . to repress movements defending land and water,\" Jared Olson, an investigative reporter working in Latin America, told Jacobin . \"Now that's coming back north. Now you're seeing a little bit of that increasingly creep into the United States.\"\n\nThe killing of Terán may be unprecedented for the modern US climate movement, but the militarization of policing climate protesters in the country did not start this year in Georgia. The use of counterinsurgency tactics to police climate defenders in the United States goes back at least to 2016, when the global security firm TigerSwan used a variety of methods including aerial surveillance, social media monitoring, radio eavesdropping, and undercover infiltration to build dossiers on the climate defenders at Standing Rock. The Intercept reported earlier this year that TigerSwan has since pitched its counterinsurgency approach to handling pipeline protests to a variety of other oil companies. Three years before TigerSwan was contracted to work at Standing Rock, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service covertly surveilled opposition to an Enbridge pipeline project in the western part of the country.\n\nGeorgia is also far from the only state with a domestic terrorism law on the books that can be used to persecute climate defenders. Since 2016, more than twenty states have enacted laws restricting protest rights - with a number of those laws specifically penalizing protesters who impede \"critical infrastructure.\"\n\nFor Olson, the manipulation of the legal system - even more than direct physical violence - is the principal strategy states and corporations are using to slow organizing and protect extractive interests. He pointed to the arrest and arbitrary detention of a number of Guapinol defenders in Honduras as an example.\n\n\"In Latin America, oftentimes you show up expecting to see bloodshed - which does happen - but what's generally happening on a larger scale is criminalization,\" Olson said.\n\nIt's not just states and corporations that are responding to crisis conditions. It's also the climate movement, which, recognizing the extreme time pressure it's under, has been changing its tactics. That's one of the reasons Woodhouse expects the level of violence protesters face to continue to rise in the coming years, even if neither he nor Olson believe the United States will become as dangerous for climate defenders as Latin America due to their differing historical and political conditions.\n\n\"I think that there is a very high likelihood that we're going to see more and more confrontations between activists and police and more and more heavy-handed action by police, in part just because we're going to see more and more direct action by activists,\" Woodhouse said. \"That's sort of where the climate movement has been moving in fits and starts for ten, fifteen years now.\"\n\nThere's another important way the US climate movement is increasingly mirroring its counterparts in Latin America: the Stop Cop City movement is not simply about the fate of a swath of forest, but rather about the future of the city of Atlanta and the militarized police state itself. It's a threat to corporations and their enforcers in a way that less intersectional climate movements have not been - as evidenced in part by the simple and head-spinning fact that the majority of the funding for Cop City is coming not from the city itself or any kind of state entity but rather from the Atlanta Police Foundation, which is contributing $60 million in donations from corporations to finance the project. Donors to the foundation's fundraising drive for the project include Bank of America, Chick-fil-A, Georgia Pacific, Rollins, and Coca-Cola, who are all betting that the police trained at the facility will help them continue to change Atlanta from a city for people to live in to a city for them to profit from.\n\nThe Stop Cop City movement has centered the fact that the training center is being built on stolen Muscogee land, the ancestral home of people driven away by the US military not two centuries ago. The climate crisis itself is the result of projects like this one, the extraction of both people and resources from the land to feed the inexhaustible capital and war machines. Seen through that lens, the killing of Terán, who was indigenous, appears not as an aberration but as a return to form.\n\n\"I think the United States was built off the murder of environmental defenders, so I don't necessarily see this as an escalation,\" Jayson Maurice Porter, a postdoctoral research associate in environment and society at Brown University, said. \"I don't see [Terán] as a first example of an environmental defender killed by the state.\"\n\nThere are other, local historical echoes. Fort Moore, just outside of Columbus, Georgia, remains home to the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation - the institution formerly known as the School of the Americas, where US military personnel trained scores of the worst human rights defenders in Latin America during the latter half of the twentieth century, the people whose institutions continue to brutalize climate defenders in the region today. The School of the Americas was launched as a means of fighting the Cold War and protecting US corporate interests abroad, but it shouldn't be a surprise when those same tactics are deployed domestically too.\n\n\"There's been all sorts of thinkers who talk about how fascism actually isn't an aberration; fascism is just a particular moment when imperialism comes back and bites its own tail - when, for whatever reason, the colonial violence in Africa becomes Nazi violence against Jews,\" Olson said.\n\nAt its core, Stop Cop City is about nothing less than fighting for democracy and habitability and the right to dissent. The level of repression the dissenters have faced is a reminder of the movement's power, the new worlds its coalition might just be able to build.\n\n\"For this generation of environmental activists, it's sort of second nature to bring together a lot of different issues that used to be seen maybe as distinctive and disparate,\" Woodhouse said. \"It's a more totalizing critique.\"\n\nThis work has been made possible by the support of the Puffin Foundation .\n\nAbe Asher is a journalist whose reporting on politics, social movements, and the climate has been published in the Nation , VICE News , the Portland Mercury , and other outlets.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

With progress stalling out on key issues like climate finance at COP29, delegates to COP30 in Brazil next fall have their work cut out for them.\n\nActivists demonstrate for climate finance for the Global South on day ten at the UNFCCC COP29 Climate Conference on November 21, 2024, in Baku, Azerbaijan.

Severe droughts and increased fires in 2023-24, driven by deforestation and crop burning, have not only accelerated carbon emissions but also jeopardized indigenous territories, pushing the ecosystem closer to an irreversible tipping point.\n\nThe Conference of the Parties (COP), the decision-making body of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), has been at the forefront of global climate negotiations since its inaugural session in 1995. Despite landmark agreements like the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Climate Agreement, the urgency for decisive action has only intensified. Global carbon dioxide emissions have surged by over 60 percent since COP1, and 2024 has brought an alarming milestone: temperatures exceeded 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels for the first time, marking what is likely to be the hottest year in recorded history.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, COP29 convened in Baku, Azerbaijan, with representatives from 198 nations and over 32,000 participants, including scientists, activists, indigenous leaders, and policymakers. This year's summit, which took place last month, comes at a pivotal moment, particularly as Brazil, home to the largest share of the Amazon, prepares to host COP30 in Belém in 2025.\n\nAt COP29, climate finance emerged as a critical and contentious issue, with developing nations advocating for trillions in funding to mitigate emissions, adapt to worsening climate impacts, and limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Despite ambitious calls, the financial commitments announced fell far short of expectations, drawing sharp dissatisfaction from Global South delegates.\n\nDeveloped countries pledged a target of $1.3 trillion annually by 2035 to support developing nations in climate adaptation and green transitions. However, only $300 billion of this sum is to come from grants and low-interest loans, with the remainder dependent on private investments and speculative funding mechanisms like fossil fuel levies. This stark disparity between demands and pledges drew widespread criticism , highlighting the ongoing inequity in climate negotiations.\n\nClaudio Angelo from Brazil's Observatório do Clima condemned the historical inertia of wealthier nations. He remarked:\n\nRich countries spent 150 years appropriating the world's atmospheric space, 33 years loitering on climate action, and three years negotiating [a settlement] without putting numbers on the table. Now, they force developing countries to accept a deal that not only lacks new money but could also increase their debt burden.\n\nHarjeet Singh, global engagement director for the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative, highlighted the failure to quantify the trillions needed or ensure these funds would be provided as grants, calling the ongoing rhetoric \"hollow\" and accusing COP29 negotiations of being \"fraught with deadlock.\"\n\nWhile criticism of the financial package dominated discussions, some leaders struck a more optimistic note. EU climate envoy Wopke Hoekstra described COP29 as \"the start of a new era for climate finance,\" while UNFCCC executive secretary Simon Stiell issued a cautionary note, warning that failure to secure meaningful financial commitments could undermine global climate goals. \"The preservation of the Amazon,\" Stiell emphasized, \"is a case in point.\"\n\nIndigenous peoples have long been at the forefront of climate action, serving as stewards of biodiversity and defenders of critical ecosystems like the Amazon. Data shows that protected areas and indigenous territories account for only 5.8 percent of the Amazon's total deforestation, despite mounting pressures from illegal mining, agriculture, and land grabbing. However, Greenpeace Brazil revealed that deforestation in indigenous territories increased by 44.5 percent in 2024, with mining activities encroaching on lands of the Kayapó, Yanomami, and Munduruku peoples. At COP29, indigenous leaders highlighted the urgent need for stronger protections of their territories and greater recognition of their rights in climate strategies.\n\nBrazilian activist Alessandra Korap Munduruku delivered a powerful message, warning against the contradictory actions of governments that promote infrastructure projects like Brazil's Ferrogrão mega-railway, which threatens 49,000 square kilometers of protected forest, while presenting pro-climate narratives. In her Letter from the Tapajós River to the World , she highlighted the destructive impact of such projects on indigenous lands and cultures, calling for adherence to international agreements like International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention 169 , which mandates proper consultation with indigenous communities.\n\nThe formation of the Troika of Indigenous Peoples, a coalition of indigenous leaders from Brazil, Australia, and the Pacific, was a key development at COP29. This initiative aims to ensure that climate policies align with the Paris Agreement while respecting indigenous self-determination and land rights. Brazilian minister of indigenous peoples Sônia Guajajara, herself an indigenous leader, called for expanded indigenous representation at COP30 in Belém, asserting that their voices must be integral to global climate decision-making.\n\nSocial movements and grassroots organizations also played a significant role at COP29, with the XI Pan-Amazonian Social Forum (FOSPA) declaring a state of emergency over the Amazon's rapid degradation. FOSPA's position document condemned the commercialization of biodiversity and called for stronger protections of ancestral lands, urging the global community to uphold commitments to indigenous and local defenders of the Amazon.\n\nThese calls for action resonated with negotiators, as discussions at COP29 included advancing Article 6 of the Paris Agreement to standardize carbon markets. A newly approved framework for high-integrity carbon credits aims to incentivize deforestation reduction, while a joint statement from fourteen countries - including Peru - reaffirmed the REDD+ initiative. These efforts emphasized the need for fair pricing of forest carbon and greater inclusion of indigenous voices in climate finance decisions.\n\nThe adoption of high-integrity methodologies for carbon credit verification was seen as a step toward incentivizing sustainable practices, but questions remained about their implementation. Market-based solutions like REDD+ risk commodifying nature while failing to address systemic issues driving environmental degradation.\n\nWhile COP29 sought to advance global commitments to combat climate change, progress was overshadowed by controversies and unresolved tensions. Among the most contentious issues was ongoing reliance on fossil fuels, a point of friction between nations advocating for rapid transition and those resisting such measures due to economic interests.\n\nThe precedent set at COP28, where nations first acknowledged the need to transition away from fossil fuels, was notably diluted at COP29. Fossil fuel-producing countries, including Saudi Arabia and Azerbaijan, lobbied to remove references to phasing out fossil fuels from the final agreements. This backtracking drew sharp criticism from environmental groups and vulnerable nations, who argued that failing to confront the root causes of climate change undermined the entire process.\n\nGrassroots movements and alternative forums like the Global Meeting for Climate and Life in Oaxaca, also known as the \"anti-COP,\" underscored growing dissatisfaction with official negotiations. Activists from marginalized communities criticized COP29 for prioritizing powerful interests over vulnerable populations, particularly indigenous groups and local communities affected by extractive industries. The event sought to bridge gaps between climate action and land defense movements, concluding with a roadmap for future activism - including planned demonstrations at COP30 in Belém - aimed at turning the world's attention to the heart of the rainforest, where the tension between development and conservation will take center stage.\n\nAmid the mounting threats to the Amazon, COP29 highlighted several restoration initiatives and international partnerships aimed at safeguarding this critical ecosystem. These efforts underscored the need for a comprehensive approach that balances environmental protection with sustainable development while centering indigenous rights and local leadership.\n\nThe Global Forest Coalition , in collaboration with over thirty civil society organizations, launched the Baku Forest Declaration . This initiative called on COP29 negotiators to prioritize justice, equity, and sustainability in climate policies. Included in the declaration is the rejection of the market-based mechanisms like carbon trading that underlie proposed solutions like REDD+. The declaration contends that frameworks such as REDD+ risk exacerbating inequities, and maintains the importance of ensuring direct funding for community-led, gender-just conservation solutions.\n\nRegional collaboration also featured prominently. The Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization (ACTO), comprising eight Amazonian countries, advanced its Forest Financing Strategy in partnership with the United Nations Forum on Forests. This strategy seeks to combat deforestation and illegal activities such as mining and logging, while promoting sustainable livelihoods. ACTO's efforts include coordinated law enforcement, enhanced financing mechanisms, and the formation of a specialized Amazon climate research group. Scheduled for presentation in Brasília this month, the strategy is a crucial step toward integrated regional responses to the Amazon's challenges.\n\nHowever, these initiatives face significant hurdles. While the Brazil Restoration & Bioeconomy Finance Coalition, launched by US president Joe Biden, pledged $10 billion in investments for Amazon conservation by 2030, only a fraction of these funds has materialized. Critics argue that such contributions, including a $50 million commitment to the Amazon Fund, are insufficient and serve more as symbolic gestures than substantive action.\n\nMoreover, the region continues to grapple with the long-term impacts of extractive industries. Between 1985 and 2023, mining in the Amazon increased by an astonishing 1,063 percent, and agriculture expanded by 598 percent, replacing vast tracts of biodiverse forest with monocultures and degraded landscapes. This unchecked expansion has rendered the Amazon increasingly vulnerable to wildfires, drought, and biodiversity loss.\n\nCivil society and grassroots organizations have emphasized the urgent need for alternative models of development. FOSPA's declaration of a \"permanent state of emergency\" for the Amazon is a rallying cry for governments to take decisive, coordinated action before irreversible damage occurs.\n\nAs the world looks toward COP30 in Brazil, these restoration and partnership efforts will face a critical test. With the Amazon's survival hanging in the balance, success will depend on translating pledges into tangible outcomes.\n\nAs COP29 concluded, the spotlight turned toward COP30, which will be hosted in Belém, Brazil, in the heart of the Amazon rainforest in November 2025. This choice is both symbolic and strategic, reflecting Amazonia's centrality to the global climate agenda. It also places Brazil, a country grappling with its contradictory character as both an \"environmental power\" and a major exporter of agricultural and extractive resources, under intense international scrutiny.\n\nPresident Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has vowed to end deforestation in the Amazon by 2030, a commitment that aligns with Brazil's Paris Agreement goals to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 67 percent by 2035. During his administration's first six months, deforestation rates reportedly fell by 34 percent. However, critics caution that these gains are fragile, especially as Brazil continues to court powerful agribusiness interests and forge deals that risk undermining its climate pledges. For example, partnerships with JBS, one of the world's largest meat producers, aim to expand beef exports to China - a move that could intensify deforestation, pushing the Amazon closer to its ecological tipping point. The recently negotiated European Union-Mercosur free-trade agreement also presents threats to the Amazon and its inhabitants.\n\nHosting COP30 in Belém presents both an opportunity and a challenge for Brazil. On one hand, it provides a platform to showcase the country's leadership in climate diplomacy and highlight successful initiatives like the Amazon Fund. On the other hand, it exposes the contradictions in Brazil's approach, where commitments to conservation coexist uneasily with the promotion of mining, infrastructure expansion, and large-scale agriculture.\n\nInternationally, COP30 will be a test of whether nations can deliver on the promises made at previous summits. Countries are expected to present updated national plans, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs), that outline more ambitious emissions reduction targets aligned with the 1.5 degree Celsius goal. For Brazil, the stakes are particularly high: as a host nation, it will be under pressure to demonstrate concrete progress in protecting the Amazon and reducing its reliance on extractive industries.\n\nBeyond government actions, COP30 is also anticipated to be a focal point for civil society and grassroots activism. Activists and indigenous leaders plan to use the event to amplify calls for systemic change, including an end to the commercialization of biodiversity and greater protections for ancestral lands. Alternative forums, like the \"anti-COP\" and the People's Summit gatherings, will likely draw attention to voices often marginalized in official negotiations, further intensifying the dialogue around justice and equity.\n\nAs the world's largest tropical rainforest and a vital carbon sink, the Amazon holds the key to the global climate crisis. COP30 represents a pivotal moment: Will the international community rise to the challenge and commit to the ambitious, equitable solutions required to protect this invaluable ecosystem? Or will the event fall short, becoming another missed opportunity to address the defining crisis of our time?\n\nA key lesson of COP29 for the climate movement is that climate politics must not be confined to official international conference halls. For Amazonia to be able to continue to sustain planetary life, business as usual is not an option. While the host country of the next COP, Brazil, plans to use it as a platform to showcase the country's commitment to the climate, such claims will ring hollow if mining, mega projects, infrastructure, farming, and oil extraction continue unabated.\n\nFor civil society, perhaps the most important model in the world right now comes from Colombia. This Amazonian country is navigating a transformative energy transition under President Gustavo Petro's administration, emphasizing a reduction in fossil fuel dependency while promoting environmental justice, economic diversification, and inclusivity for indigenous and marginalized communities.\n\nThe government has halted new oil and gas exploration licenses and fracking projects, leveraging a $40 billion investment plan to foster renewable energy, ecotourism, and sustainable agriculture. However, the fossil fuel sector, which constitutes a significant portion of exports and government revenue, presents a challenge to financial stability during this shift. Despite these hurdles, initiatives like energy communities, a net-zero buildings roadmap, and enhanced indigenous consultation offer hope for a just transition in one of the world's most biodiverse nations, which is also South America's third-largest producer of hydrocarbons in South America.\n\nCOP29 has underscored the Amazon's critical role in global climate health and emphasized the need for strong, multilateral action to secure its future. As global leaders prepare for COP30 in Brazil, the international community faces a pivotal moment to implement comprehensive, equitable, and effective strategies for Amazon conservation. What we truly need is robust political action and sustained pressure on our governments to act decisively, as Colombia has demonstrated. However, given that a green transition in a single country cannot succeed in isolation, multilateral climate policies are essential - despite the evident shortcomings of the COP process in delivering meaningful results.\n\nThe COP is already home to Amazonian diplomacy, with its contradictions, and this role will only grow more prominent - and more contested - over the next year. Moving from Baku to Belém means much more than just changing cities for the traveling spectacle that the COPs have become. The changes ahead are immense: from ensuring robust financial mechanisms to supporting indigenous rights and sustainable livelihoods. However, with dedicated international cooperation, strong leadership, and popular pressure, COP30 in Belém could set a transformative agenda for the Amazon's protection and mark a decisive step toward climate resilience.\n\nBernardo Jurema is a climate researcher at the Research Institute for Sustainability in Potsdam, Germany.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

The show vividly captured the failures of American policing that would animate the George Floyd protests 20 years later.\n\nStill from The Shield . (FX)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nAmericans love cop shows. In fact, about 20 percent of all scripted network TV shows are about law enforcement. And while most of these programs follow the same tired premise of honorable characters doing their best to catch the bad guys while balancing the stressors of family life, there is one cop show that stands out from the rest.\n\nOriginally aired in 2002, FX's The Shield turned the boilerplate cop show on its head. Unlike the prestige television show The Wire, a more pensive and high-brow offering that premiered the same year on HBO, The Shield followed the format of shows like Law & Order and NCIS - except instead of unquestioningly valorizing police work, it centered on Detective Vic Mackey and his corrupt, anti-gang \"Strike Team\" as they rampaged through the streets of Los Angeles. What made The Shield different from its contemporaries was its explicit focus on the dark side of policing. Throughout the show, Mackey breaks every law on the books, including but not limited to drug dealing, torture, planting evidence, illegal searches and seizures, and murder.\n\nThough twenty years old, the Emmy-winning series shines a light on two facets of modern America that still plague the country today: our punitive and ineffective policing model, and the authoritarian hysteria of the \"war on terror.\"\n\nThe Shield was inspired by the illicit actions creator Shawn Ryan saw while shadowing the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) for his much rosier cop show, Nash Bridges. \"What I saw [during the ride-alongs] was much darker,\" Ryan told Entertainment Weekly in 2017.\n\nRyan's pilot script was based on the Rampart scandal , which the Los Angeles Times called \"the worst corruption scandal in L.A.P.D. history.\" In September of 1999, Officer Rafael Pérez was caught stealing a million dollars of cocaine from an evidence locker. He agreed to a plea deal and began to reveal widespread corruption throughout the department. When the dust settled, Pérez had fingered close to seventy police officers in crimes such as bogus arrests, false confessions, perjured testimony, the planting of evidence, and more. According to Pérez, these practices were most frequent among the city's anti-gang units, the inspiration for Mackey's Strike Team.\n\nMembers of the Strike Team torture suspects, plant evidence, deal drugs, are openly racist, have sex with suspects, and steal with absolute impunity. The Shield's title card - the theme song \"Just Another Day\" playing over an image of a fractured police badge - leaves little room for interpretation. The show's perspective is that violent and often extralegal control of Los Angeles's minority and poor neighborhoods is routine for the officers of the LAPD. The show's second episode, titled \"Our Gang,\" poses a side-by-side comparison of the funerals of a gang member and a police officer, drawing explicit parallels between the lawbreaking groups.\n\nIn addition to portraying flagrant disregard for civil liberties and procedural justice, The Shield illustrates the inherent inability of American policing to solve the problems it claims to - indeed, how the cops often make things worse. In one of the most memorable scenes of the show, the new police captain gives a speech to her officers, stating: \"We can't solve poverty, we can't solve addiction. But we can distinguish between the criminals and the citizens.\" Such words echo the viewpoint of activists critical of policing, who have long claimed that armed police are unable to solve the actual underlying problems that cause crime.\n\nNot long after this speech, The Shield shows officers seizing cars and houses from suspected (but unconvicted) criminals to fund the hiring of more cops and the purchase of military-grade weaponry for Mackey's Strike Team. When a black officer protests that taking a single mother's house will put her and her children onto the street where they are destined for a life of crime in order to survive, the captain dismisses him, saying, \"I don't care what skin color you are. But you're either blue or you're out.\"\n\nThe Shield also captures the widespread fear of the post-9/11 years, and demonstrated how it was weaponized by the state both at home and abroad. Though it is exclusively set in Los Angeles, there's no shortage of references to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In a later season, the Strike Team gains a member nicknamed \"Army,\" who teaches the others abusive tactics he learned \"going door to door in Baghdad.\"\n\nThe pilot episode shows Mackey torturing a suspect in an interrogation room under the watch of his captain. It only escalates from there, as he burns, beats, and threatens to send suspects to prisons where they will be raped and killed by other inmates. He even has a secret remote torture site where victims are suspended from chains, an image strikingly similar to those seen in the American torture camps at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay.\n\nOn this point, however, The Shield errs. The portrayal is stomach-turning, but the problem is that in the world of the show - unlike in real life, where confessions extracted under torture are often false - it actually works. Like many other American films and series of the time, it seems to suggest to America that torture, while perhaps immoral, is at least a viable method for \"getting the bad guys,\" whether they're low-level drug dealers or high-level al-Qaeda operatives.\n\nNevertheless, The Shield captures the hysteria of the war on terror period, showing how rational thinking and proportionate responses were dismissed in favor of groupthink and maximal force. In one episode, a minor gang member claims affiliation with al-Qaeda, bringing the Department of Homeland Security on to the case, demonstrating the broad reach of the post-9/11 anti-terror apparatus.\n\nAgain, however, the show reveals its limitations. In the final seasons, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) makes an appearance as the cutting-edge face of federal law enforcement, offering an alternative to the brutal tactics of the LAPD. One wonders whether the writers would have shaped that storyline the same way today, after mass protests against ICE have convinced many that it's not a necessary agency, but is instead a heavy-handed expression of American xenophobia and anti-immigrant paranoia.\n\nIt's not clear that Ryan himself really understands the implications of The Shield. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly , Ryan claimed that \"98 percent of the time Mackey is doing the right thing.\" This will come as a surprise to anyone who watches the show, as 98 percent of every episode consists of Mackey's Strike Team breaking the law. In other interviews, it seems that Ryan was setting out to dramatize the warts on an otherwise noble project to \"protect and serve.\"\n\nBut whatever its creator's own intentions, The Shield vividly captured the depravity and brokenness of American policing. In the aftermath of the George Floyd protests of 2020, it looks less like a case for tossing bad apples than a condemnation of the entire enterprise.\n\nJoe Mayall is a writer from Denver, Colorado.

      "text": "Ferguson Cop Darren Wilson Is Just the Latest to Go Unprosecuted for a Fatal Shooting\n\nWilson at a City Council meeting in February 2014; a photo of Michael Brown displayed at his funeral on August 25, 2014 City of Ferguson/AP; Robert Cohen/St. Louis Post-Dispatch/AP\n\nAfter weeks of rising tension in Ferguson and the broader St. Louis region, the St. Louis County grand jury reviewing the death of Michael Brown has decided not to indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson, who shot and killed Brown on August 9. Reported leaks during the grand jury proceedings suggested there would be no indictment-and that outcome fits a long-standing pattern. Few police officers who shoot and kill citizens in St. Louis have been investigated by a grand jury, let alone charged by one, according to data from city and county prosecutors.\n\nBetween 2004 and 2014, there have been 14 fatal officer-involved shootings committed by St. Louis County PD officers alone, according to police data collected by David Klinger, a criminologist at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. That does not include fatal shootings by Ferguson police or by officers from various other law enforcement agencies within the county. Many officer-involved fatalities likely were not subject to grand jury investigations because they were deemed justified by police internal affairs or the local prosecutor's office, Klinger says. Since 2000, only four cases in all of St. Louis County, including Wilson's, have been investigated by a grand jury, according to a spokesperson for St. Louis County prosecutor Robert McCulloch's office. McCulloch's office declined to provide details to Mother Jones on the three other cases, which it says are closed.\n\nIn September, Heather Cole of Missouri Lawyers Weekly used news reports to identify five grand jury investigations of officer-involved fatalities prior to Wilson's that took place during McCulloch's tenure, which began in 1991. As with Wilson's case, none led to an indictment:\n\nMcCulloch's record and family ties to the police force sparked controversy in the wake of Brown's death.\n\nStatistics from the City of St. Louis paint a similar picture: A total of 39 people were fatally shot by police officers between 2003 and 2012; according to the St. Louis Circuit Attorney's office, only one police officer has been indicted in such a case since 2000, and that officer was acquitted.\n\nRoger Goldman, an expert on criminal procedure and constitutional law at the Saint Louis University School of Law, says that a long-standing Missouri statute gives police officers wide latitude to shoot to kill. The law states they are justified in doing so if they \"reasonably believe\" their target \"has committed or attempted to commit a felony\" and deadly force is \"immediately necessary to effect the arrest.\" According to Goldman, the existence of this law-despite a 1985 Supreme Court ruling suggesting it may be unconstitutional-is one reason why \"it's particularly difficult to get grand juries to indict or prosecutors to even take the case to the grand jury in the first place.\"\n\nBut with a case like Wilson's, weeks of high-profile public protests likely pressured the prosecutor's office to present a case to a grand jury, says Delores Jones-Brown, a law professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. \"This way the prosecutor cannot be accused of having made a unilateral biased decision.\" Still, the prosecutor has a lot of sway in how a case is presented to the grand jury, she noted.\n\nPrior to the decision in Wilson's case, McCulloch said he would seek to release transcripts and audio from the grand jury investigation if it resulted in no indictment for Wilson. The documents have since been released .\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Chicago's Top Cop Wants 7 Officers Fired in Cover-Up of Fatal Shooting\n\nSuperintendent Eddie Johnson. M. Spencer Green\n\nThe head of the Chicago Police Department will ask the city's police civilian review board to fire seven officers allegedly involved in covering up the fatal police shooting of black teenager Laquan McDonald back in October 2014, an incident the New York Times Editorial Board characterized as an execution .\n\nPolice Superintendent Eddie Johnson announced his decision on Thursday morning, just two days after the Chicago Inspector General's office issued a report recommending that 10 officers involved in the alleged cover-up be fired or disciplined. Johnson stripped seven of the officers of police powers, but the review board must okay their ouster. Two more officers have already left the department: A deputy chief who signed off on a report justifying the shooting retired last week, and a lieutenant retired in May. Johnson said that he did not see sufficient evidence that the tenth officer did anything wrong.\n\nThe McDonald case came to the nation's attention when a judge forced Chicago officials to release police footage of the incident. The footage showed Chicago officer Jason Van Dyke, who is white, shooting McDonald 16 times-several shots were fired while McDonald lay wounded on the ground. Van Dyke initially claimed the teen charged him with a knife. McDonald did have a knife, but the footage clearly shows him walking away from Van Dyke when the officer opened fire.\n\nWhile the former officer was eventually charged with first-degree murder, the shooting and its bungling by city officials prompted national outrage and an investigation by the Department of Justice. A New York Times op-ed accused Mayor Rahm Emanuel of sitting on the video, which his office apparently received shortly after the shooting, because its release might have hurt Emanuel's chances in a tight run-off election.\n\nChief prosecutor Anita Alvarez came under attack for waiting more than a year to file charges against Officer Van Dyke; she was voted out of office in March following a relentless protest campaign in which demonstrators showed up at her public speaking engagements. Emanuel fired former police superintendent Gary McCarthy last December. Johnson, the new superintendent, was appointed in April. Earlier this month, a judge appointed a special prosecutor to oversee the case against Van Dyke, rather than rely on prosecutor Alvarez, whose term expires in December.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Stop Cop City Activists Turn Up the Heat on Nationwide Insurance in Arizona\n\nCollin Mayfield/Sipa USA via AP\n\nOn Monday evening , three activists connected with the effort to stall construction of a vast police training facility just outside of Atlanta were arrested 1,700 miles away in Arizona as organizers target insurance companies connected to the project.\n\nScottsdale Insurance Co., a subsidiary of Nationwide Insurance, is one of the primary insurers of the Atlanta Police Foundation, the organization spearheading the construction of what activist's call \"Cop City,\" according to records obtained by Truthout.\n\nIn a video shared with a Truthout reporter, activists can be seen staging a sit-in in the middle of two entrances to the community, in which they say a Nationwide executive lives , with their hands duct taped to concrete-filled tires, chanting \"this is not a local struggle\" as cars line up behind them. Arizona's Maricopa County Sherriff's office confirmed that protestors there were removed, arrested, and jailed for \"[d]isorderly conduct, [t]respassing, and resisting arrest.\"\n\n\"I've decided to lock myself down today to show that there will be no peace in your home while you attack ours,\" said one of the protesters before locking themselves down.\n\nThe $90 million dollar facility is 75 percent completed, according to Atlanta officials. Activists have spent the last three years using a variety of legal, political, and legislative avenues, including a referendum that generated thousands of signatures that the city refused to verify for months, to stop construction of the facility, which they believe will further expose Atlanta residents to police violence and destroy one of the last remaining urban forests in the area. Activists have mobilized support from around the country and from key players in the Democratic Party like Stacey Abrams . As a result of their work, nearly 60 percent of Atlanta voters want the future of Cop City to be determined by public vote.\n\nLocal officials have responded by doubling down on the importance of the training center, which they claim is critical to improving public safety. Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens has gone out of his way to disparage the referendum effort, but the City Council passed legislation in early February that will move the Stop Cop City ballot initiative forward albeit with a restrictive signature verification process that could disproportionately impact Black, elderly, and disabled voters.\n\nThe Arizona protest came hours after more than 50 activists rallied at the main headquarters of Nationwide Insurance in Scottsdale, Arizona. According to a press representative for the activists, the goal of the rally and sit-in was to pressure the company's Arizona subsidiary to cancel its insurance contract with the Atlanta Police Foundation. Nationwide Insurance reportedly shut down its headquarters in anticipation of protests. The company did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nCharges against the arrested protesters have yet to be announced, but in Georgia Stop Cop City activists are facing an avalanche of political repression . According to the New York Times , 43 people who have demonstrated against the training facility are now facing domestic terrorism charges, a move the ACLU has described as an \"extreme intimidation\" tactic. Even more are facing police surveillance and intimidation.\n\nJust two weeks ago, Georgia law enforcement conducted three pre-dawn raids against activists in what officials claim was an effort to identify activists committing acts of sabotage and arson against training center construction and police equipment. Law enforcement arrested one activist for arson and, according to the Guardian , forced \"a woman out of her house with no shirt, left a naked photo of another woman on display after ransacking a room and dragged a man by his hair-while arresting none of them.\"\n\nWhile the movement to Stop Cop City is rooted in Atlanta, it has energized organizers across the country, including in Arizona, where activists just hosted a national summit to Stop Cop City last week. To many of the participants, the police training facility (and the legal and political efforts to crush the resistance) is a national issue. They also see it as intertwined with Israel's escalating war on Gaza, as Cop City will likely supercharge existing efforts, like the Georgia International Law Enforcement Exchange (GILEE) , to train Israeli police officers in the Atlanta area.\n\n\"The expansion of police power in Atlanta is intimately connected to the violence of the border here in the Sonoran Desert, which is intimately connected to the ongoing genocide in Gaza,\" said Ian Blank, an activist who joined the rally outside Nationwide Insurance. \"The same corporations profiting off the genocide of Gaza, such as Tucson-based weapons manufacturer Raytheon, are also innovating surveillance technologies along the U.S./Mexico border.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Kamala Was a Cop. Black People Knew It First.\n\nKamala Harris, then California's attorney general, with Long Beach Police Chief Jim McDonnell (left), Los Angeles Deputy Police Chief Michel Moore, and Los Angeles interim County Sheriff John Scott at a 2014 event. Nick Ut/AP\n\nIn a roundtable discussion hosted by Blavity in October, Sen. Kamala Harris briefly addressed the meme that had beset her presidential campaign. \"I'm fully aware of that whole meme about 'Kamala is a cop,'\" she said, an aggrieved note creeping into her tone, \"and there are strategic reasons people are doing that.\" The meme, she suggested, was a part of a calculated effort to turn a strength-her record as a prosecutor-into a weakness.\n\nThis was the line taken by many of her eulogists in the wake of her decision last week to suspend her campaign. Amanda Marcotte at Salon blamed leftist \"bro\" types for truly weaponizing the meme:\n\nIt's fine, of course, if people look at Harris' history and feel like they would prefer another candidate...But that wasn't what was happening with the \"Kamala is a cop\" meme. Instead, that was about wiping out a nuanced discussion of her history in favor of a gross generalization. More to the point, in practice it was mostly about a bunch of douchey white guys appropriating very real concerns - that had primarily been raised by communities of color - as an excuse for dunking endlessly on the first black woman to run for president who seemed to have a real shot at winning.\n\nDon't give the \"douchey white guys\" too much credit. No doubt there were racist and sexist opportunists using the \"Kamala is a cop\" meme as a cudgel. But the reason it was there to be picked up in the first place is because Black communities, in particular Black women, had done the work of radically re-evaluating Harris' record and rhetoric on criminal justice.\n\nOn Black Twitter, calling out aspects of Harris's record as a prosecutor wasn't just about getting one over on a candidate. It was about holding her accountable for her past actions, which include an anti-truancy law that threatened the parents of students who skipped school with criminal charges, and various failures to hold police and prosecutors accountable for misconduct. For a long time a gross generalization had prevailed-that Harris had done commendable, hard-edged work as a prosecutor, and that this record would position her well in national politics. She'd even proudly declared herself California's \" top cop \" in 2016 -two years after the Ferguson protests. Marcotte has things backward. In a climate where Democrats still felt they had to pander to the law-and-order crowd, \"Kamala is a cop\" was the nuance.\n\nThat's it. I can't take it.\n\nIt isn't (only) that Kamala was a top cop. It's that *she called herself a top cop*.\n\nSome voters registered the difference, even if they couldn't articulate it.\n\n- Tressie McMillan Cottom (@tressiemcphd) December 4, 2019\n\nFor Marcotte, the \"Kamala is a cop\" meme was an example of a \"toxic\" internet culture run amok. But this view puts the minority of internet bullies ahead of the legitimate critics who helped move the consensus on law enforcement in America. \"The current debates about criminal justice reform are, in large part, a product of the Black Lives Matter movement and organizing,\" Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, author of #BlackLivesMatter to Black Liberation and assistant professor of African American Studies at Princeton University, wrote in an email. \"Of course, there were steps or a pre-history to the Ferguson rebellion and the resultant BLM movement. Michelle Alexander's book The New Jim Crow gave ordinary people language to describe the reality and the results on mass incarceration.\"\n\nThe \"Kamala is a cop\" meme was born of generations of research and local activism demanding reforms to the criminal justice system-including a very different, often less aggressive role for prosecutors. This history dates back to the 1960s and '70s, when activists like Angela Davis, Elaine Brown, and other members of the Black Panther Party first began calling for radical prison reform and questioning the idea that the existing criminal justice system made communities safer. There is a direct through-line between this work and that of modern groups like #BlackLivesMatter and Assata's Daughters. In Chicago, the latter played a key role in ousting the former state's attorney for Cook County, Anita Alvarez, after the killings of Rekiya Boyd and Laquan McDonald, two landmark cases that happened on her watch. The actions and rhetoric of these groups helped shift the broader cultural consensus about what the American criminal justice system should look like.\n\nThese legitimate critiques, not trolls hiding behind computer screens, gave the \"Kamala is a cop\" meme its power. Black Americans, who have wildly disproportionate contact with police and prisons, had cause to be wary of a presidential candidate, even a Black woman, who not only made her bones in the criminal justice system but adduced her work there to the case for her presidency. On Black Twitter, the meme was a reminder, not an explanation. Early on, Harris struggled to attract Black voters. Some were concerned about her electability, while others were truly mistrustful of her record and her promise to be the \" progressive prosecutor\" candidate.\n\nExclusive footage of Kamala Harris waving goodbye to the single black mothers she put on the bus headed to prison because they teen skipped school too many times pic.twitter.com/PQidQlW0h0\n\n- The Spike King 👑 (@SpikeReeds) August 2, 2019\n\nKamala Harris on her way to prosecute Tulsi Gabbard for murdering Kamala Harris on national television #DemDebate2 pic.twitter.com/XyUV4jE0PP\n\n- Dray (@DrayOlaya) August 1, 2019\n\nI heard Kamala Harris is pulling up to the tailgate with arrest warrants\n\n- Hooded Justice (@ItsDesmondo) October 8, 2019\n\nBreaking: Kamala Harris is a cop. https://t.co/6SpD6v6cDI\n\n- #RIPBassemMasri 🙏 (@Delo_Taylor) March 9, 2018\n\nFrederick Joseph, writing for the Independent , saw the meme as part of a larger racist, sexist attack on Harris:\n\nIn an era where social justice and movements such as Black Lives Matter enjoy much-needed visibility, Harris's opposition saw an opportunity to pounce. They criticised her record, her language and her connections with the establishment by spreading exaggerated and often false information about who she was and what she stood for. At one point, it even appeared that social media bots were maliciously spreading tweets claiming she wasn't \"black enough\" and questioning her ethnicity .\n\nConflating the genuine criticism with the bad-faith attacks is itself a kind of disinformation, and in any case it begs the question of why \"Kamala is a cop\" was so effective to begin with. Her defenders say the meme failed to capture the complexity of her prosecutorial record , its progressive aspects, her opposition to capital punishment during her time as San Francisco district attorney, the fact that she emerged from an era during which Democrats had to talk like Spiro Agnew in order to get elected.\n\nBut this was the point: Harris's record suggested she saw criminal justice less as a matter of human rights than as a set of politics to be negotiated-witness her defense as California attorney general, with reelection on the horizon, of the state's right to execute people , or her flip-flop on marijuana legalization. The argument she made during the presidential campaign was that, relative to the larger context of American law enforcement, the outcomes of these negotiations were progressive.\n\n\"Kamala is a cop\" dispensed with this sort of tortured calculation. There was no Pinocchio-rated fact-check to be done on the meme. It wasn't a careful weighing of her record. It certainly wasn't disinfo. It said only what Kamala herself had said, that she was a cop, the difference being that it operated from the new-forming consensus, achieved by the work of Black activists online and out in the world, that a cop was a bad thing to be.\n\nAshley Reese at Jezebel traced the meme's growth in popularity among young voters skeptical of Harris's message: \"The meme merely took publicly accessible information and translated it into an easily disseminated catchphrase. 'You voting for Kamala? No way, she's a cop.'\"\n\n\"I think Harris tried to present herself as a reformer and even as a progressive,\" Taylor wrote in an email to Mother Jones . \"It stood in such stark contrast to her actual record and political comportment that it made it appear as if she were another politician who said one thing while doing another.\"\n\nThe \"Kamala is a cop\" meme, like any politically effective slogan, got at a more complicated truth: The Democratic Party's romance with mass incarceration is over. Black activism ended it. Harris didn't lose because the meme stuck. The meme stuck because Harris and her brand of criminal justice had already lost.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

He's Now Suing For \"Permanent\" Trauma.\n\nJanet Cooksey, center, the mother of Quintonio Legrier, is comforted by family and friends during a December 27 press conference about the shooting death of her son by the Chicago police. Nancy Stone/TNS via ZUMA Wire\n\nThe controversial case of a Chicago cop who shot and killed two people last December took another dramatic turn on Friday, when the officer sued one of the victim's families for more than $10 million in damages.\n\nOfficer Robert Rialmo, who fatally shot 19-year-old Quintonio LeGrier and 55-year-old Bettie Jones, has filed a counter claim in response to a wrongful death lawsuit brought by the teen's family against the city of Chicago. According to the court document filed in Cook County, Rialmo claims \"permanent\" emotional distress and personal injuries resulting from the incident.\n\nIt is the first time since the shooting that Rialmo has publicly offered his own version of events.\n\nRialmo came to the front door of a two-story apartment building in the early morning hours after Christmas, responding to a dispatch about a domestic disturbance involving a \" son with a baseball bat .\" According to Rialmo, Jones answered the door first, then retreated into her apartment, which shared a hallway with the unit where the teenager LeGrier was staying with his family. The police officer said he was standing in the building's doorway when LeGrier came \"barging out of the front door to the second floor apartment while holding a baseball bat in his right hand.\"\n\nRialmo claims LeGrier then swung the bat multiple times, the first time close enough \"to feel the movement of air as the bat passed in front of his face.\" LeGrier advanced as the officer backed down the outside stairs and shouted commands to drop the bat, Rialmo stated, adding that he feared LeGrier would hit him in the head. Rialmo then fired eight rounds \"in approximately two-and-a-half seconds.\"\n\nThe bullets fatally struck LeGrier, as well as Jones, who by this point had re-emerged from her unit and was standing behind the teenager, according to the court filing. Rialmo stated he only saw Jones after he walked back up the stairs to LeGrier's body. A witness previously told Mother Jones that he saw LeGrier laying on top of Jones's body in the hallway.\n\nRialmo claims that LeGrier's actions were criminal and caused the officer to \"have a reasonable apprehension of suffering an imminent battery from LeGrier, which would either cause Officer Rialmo's death or cause him severe and permanent bodily harm.\" These actions forced Rialmo \"to end LeGrier's life, and to accidently take the innocent life of Bettie Jones,\" which \"caused, and will continue to cause, Officer Rialmo to suffer extreme emotional trauma.\"\n\nIn the family's wrongful death suit , LeGrier's father stated that his son never posed a threat to Rialmo before the officer opened fire. Rialmo also failed to administer medical care as the teen lay bleeding on the ground, according to the family's complaint.\n\nRialmo's counter-claim is a rare move for an officer involved in a fatal shooting, according to the New York Times . In an email to the Times , a spokesperson for Mayor Rahm Emanuel said that \"the city does not support the claim,\" and is \"not involved in any way.\"\n\nHere is the full text of Rialmo's claim:\n\nCounterclaim by Chicago Police Officer Robert Rialmo (PDF) Counterclaim by Chicago Police Officer Robert Rialmo (Text)\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Voting Rights Groups Condemn Atlanta's Verification Process for Cop City Referendum\n\nA canvasser with the Stop Cop City Vote Coalition speaks with an Atlanta resident. Brynn Anderson/AP\n\nOn Monday, more than 25 of the leading voting rights groups in Georgia-including Fair Fight Action and New Georgia Project, both founded by former Georgia state legislator Stacey Abrams- signed an open letter that strongly criticized what they described as voter suppression tactics happening in their state. The letter wasn't addressed to Republicans. It was sent to Atlanta's Democratic Mayor Andre Dickens, and the majority-Democrat Atlanta City Council, after an announcement that the city would use \"signature matching\" to verify the petitions for a city ballot initiative referendum on whether or not to build the Atlanta Public Safety Training Center, better known as \"Cop City.\"\n\n\"Democracy calls on us to defend the right to participate in our civic process, not only when it is politically expedient or easy, but in every instance--without fail,\" they write.\n\nCop City has become one of the defining issues in Atlanta politics over the last two years. Opponents of the project argue that Cop City will further militarize the police and raze vital green space, while supporters say that the new training facility is essential for police morale and retention.\n\nSince June , the Stop Cop City Vote Coalition has led a campaign to gather enough signatures-between 70,000 and 80,000-to allow Atlantans to vote on whether to build the facility. Initially, they had 60 days to gather. In July a judge extended the deadline through mid-September. The city has already cleared most of the logistical hurdles to begin building Cop City-including an 11-4 vote from the Atlanta City Council in June to partly fund the project with public money (the rest of the funding will come from the Atlanta Police Foundation). But the Cop City referendum-modeled on a successful effort in Camden County, Georgia-is one of the final barriers.\n\nAccording to a press release from the Stop Cop City Vote Coalition, they were prepared to turn in their 104,000 signatures on Monday--notably more than twice the amount of votes Mayor Andre Dickens received when he won in 2021-but over the weekend they heard from sources that the City might adjust the legal minimum signature count for ballot access, and that officials were planning to utilize a burdensome verification process. After the rumor spread, on Monday the coalition announced they were holding off until their September 23 deadline. That afternoon city officials sent a memo that announced the process to verify the petitions. It included \"signature matching,\" an ostensible fraud prevention method in which a prospective voter's signature on the petition is confirmed to correspond with a signature from the same voter registered in the state's database.\n\n\"In an effort to ensure that adequate resources are dedicated to this project, the City of Atlanta-through the adoption of the Atlanta City Council-has developed a step-by-step process to conduct the audit of the documents, of which the signature verification process maybe a critical element,\" said Interim Municipal Clerk Vanessa Waldon in the city's announcement.\n\nThis requirement is what has drawn the ire of voting rights groups in the state. \"Signature verification is notoriously subjective, disproportionately impacts voters of color, and is biased against disabled and elderly voters,\" Fair Fight Action wrote on Twitter. \"Fair Fight calls on the @CityofAtlanta to rescind their intent [to] use this process, and to enact steps that fairly evaluate these petitions.\"\n\nOver thirty states use signature matching, but the practice has come under fire by voting rights groups and has been the subject of lawsuits that allege that it does more to weaken the democratic process than strengthen it. The ACLU has filed lawsuits against signature match laws all across the country because \"a perceived signature mismatch heavily affects voters already at the margins-people with disabilities, trans and gender-nonconforming people, women, people for whom English is a second language, and military personnel.\" I n support of a lawsuit challenging Ohio's signature matching law in 2020, a political scientist found that for every invalid ballot, thirty-two valid ones are thrown out. When the Stanford-MIT Healthy Elections Project analyzed the 2020 Florida primaries , they found that Black and Latino voters were twice as likely to have their ballots rejected.\n\nFor Democrats in Atlanta's city government, it's difficult for this use of signature matching to not look contradictory. In a speech focused on Republicans' threats to democracy in January 2022 in Atlanta, President Biden called the city \"the cradle of civil rights\" while insisting on the need to pass voting rights legislation like the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom To Vote Act. At the time, Mayor Dickens issued a statement saying that \"I will personally do everything in my power to support the passing of those two very critical bills.\" According to the Brennan Center for Justice, the \"Freedom To Vote Act includes \"safeguards to ensure fair resolution of discrepancies between a voter's signature on a mail ballot and their signature on file with election authorities.\"\n\nSignature-matching has also become a major issue in Georgia politics. In 2018, Gwinnett County was the subject of two separate lawsuits over ballot rejections. When the data was analyzed , experts found that four percent of ballots from white voters were rejected, compared with 11 percent from Black voters, and 15 percent from Asian-American voters. Ahead of the Georgia Senate runoff in 2021, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected a lawsuit brought by the campaigns of Republican candidates Kelly Loefler and David Perdue that would've rejected more absentee ballots by changing the signature matching rules.\n\nNew Georgia Project Action Fund CEO Kendra Cotton issued a blistering statement on Monday, calling on Mayor Dickens and the city government to \"immediately rescind this process and replace it with one built on sound, fair, and transparent procedures.\" Cotton said the \"arcane method to verify petition signatures in the push to get a referendum on Cop City on the ballot is the same method used for years by the GOP to throw out valid ballots cast by Georgia voters.\"\n\nSo far, Atlanta has not responded to requests for clarity on multiple procedures from Cop City activists.\n\n\"The City should immediately announce a rolling cure process, where voters can find out if their signature has been rejected or counted as soon as that decision is made, and how to fix, or 'cure' their signature so they ensure it is in fact counted,\" said Kate Shapiro, tactical lead for the Cop City Vote Coalition, in a statement. The city's memo did not include details for how rejected signatures could be addressed.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "\"Suicide by Cop\": How Police Present Killings as Unavoidable\n\nSteven Wilson\n\nAmerican police speak in a peculiar lexicon. When an officer guns somebody down, it is an \"officer-involved shooting.\" When a department spokesperson speaks of \"the use of force,\" police violence is reduced to basic physics. \"Fatality\" dulls a plainer reality: that somebody has been killed.\n\nA less-discussed clause carries with it the same obfuscation of meaning: \"suicide by cop.\" The phrase refers to a person who provokes the police's violence to kill themselves . But too often it has been loosely applied to excuse police killings as unavoidable.\n\nThe history is murky but \"suicide by cop\" is thought to have been coined by a cop-turned-psychologist named Karl Harris in the early 1980s. When he left policing, Harris supposedly took up work at a suicide hotline in Los Angeles. \"I saw all the different ways people attempted suicide,\" he told the New York Times more than a decade later, \"and it occurred to me that maybe some people were actually forcing cops to shoot them because they wanted to die.\" Harris, who would go on to earn a PhD, conducted an informal study on suicides by cop; it was never published, but the concept caught on among scholars. At the time, new theories of criminality and social deviance were changing the foundations of policing. One theory soon to become orthodox saw derelict neighborhoods-signified by \" broken windows \"-as sites of criminality demanding control. Simultaneously, mental illness was increasingly being treated by jails and prisons, rather than by other institutions. \"Suicide by cop\" joined a bundle of new concepts that recast the perceived social crises of the day as manifest in a group of violent people who would only understand violence in return; the rise of a militant police force could be explained, in this logic, as self-protection.\n\nBy the end of the '90s, the phrase secured its place in the minds of police as absolution. \"These people want to die,\" a SWAT veteran said at the time. \"How are you about to change their minds?\" Academics followed along. In their studies, they often took for granted that people were trying to be killed. They focused on locating the measurable traces of this new suicidality, rather than on probing the sureness or explanatory power of the concept.\n\nTheir findings were generally questionable. In one 1998 paper , published by the FBI, a police killing was deemed a suicide by cop because the victim was holding up an unloaded rifle and, just before he was shot, had \"a strange look\" on his face. (The paper remains well cited today.) Another influential study that year, led by a Harvard Medical School professor, relied on assuming police violence victims as suicidal if, when confronted by officers, they exhibited suicidal characteristics like raising a gun or, in one case, holding an undisclosed \"blunt object.\"\n\nFor all the cases of suicide by cop that rely on surmise, there are some that don't. Buried in a couple of journal articles are mentions of victims' notes, in which people announce their intention to die. But such admissions are rare.\n\nAccording to a 2016 review of the literature, \"tentative evidence\" suggests that somewhere between one-tenth and one-half of all police shootings are suicides by cop. But why would 100 to 500 people choose to die at the hand of the police each year? Some law enforcement experts say that victims have a death wish they cannot fulfill alone. Others think victims could possess ulterior motives. A Yale pathologist, who doubled as deputy chief medical examiner of the Bronx, co-authored a study that proposed that some victims could be angling for their families to receive a life-insurance payout.\n\nThe speed to proclaim deaths as suicides has consequences. A 2021 study found that more than half of police killings in the United States are mislabeled by medical officials. Suicide by cop adds to this problem. It falsely \"implies that a huge number of killings are justified,\" says Alex Vitale, a sociologist at Brooklyn College.\n\nIn the police's common language, suicide by cop satisfies some basic element of police self-understanding. If a person is armed, cops shoot. If a person acts strange, cops shoot. These are the bulk of deaths researchers describe as \"suicides by cop,\" as if police killings were no more avoidable than natural law. The police, in their strange tongue, tend to say more about themselves than about anything else.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

Antonio Perez/Zuma\n\nThe day before Chicago authorities plan to release a violent video showing the killing of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald, the Chicago police officer who allegedly shot him 16 times in October 2014 will face first-degree murder charges, according to the Chicago Tribune .\n\nJason Van Dyke, 37, is the first Chicago police officer to be charged with first-degree murder in nearly 35 years, according to the Tribune . Van Dyke appeared in court Tuesday to hear the charges and is scheduled to have a bond hearing Tuesday afternoon. The city of Chicago said it would release a recording of the shooting from a police car dashboard camera, which showed Van Dyke \"jumping out of his squad car and within seconds unloading 16 rounds into 17-year-old McDonald,\" lawyers for McDonald's family told the Tribune. They added that \"after the first few shots knocked McDonald to the ground, Van Dyke fired another volley that struck the teen repeatedly as his body lay in almost a fetal position on the ground.\"\n\nThe police narrative of the events has been at odds with what was recorded on the video. The police have said that after responding to a report of someone trying to break into cars, they found McDonald in the street, puncturing the tires of a car with a knife. When ordered to drop the knife, the police say McDonald turned and walked away. The responding officers didn't have a Taser and called requested backup, but they followed McDonald. A second police car arrived and the two cars tried to box McDonald in. Police say he punctured one of the police cars' tires with a knife and damaged a windshield. When police got out of the car, according to initial police claims, McDonald lunged at them with a knife and Van Dyke shot him.\n\nBut the video reportedly shows McDonald walking away when Van Dyke opens fire, and an autopsy showed that several of the bullets hit McDonald in the back. In April, the city of Chicago gave the McDonald family a $5 million settlement before they filed suit, according to the Tribune , but the city prevented the video from going public until the investigation into Van Dyke concluded. In response to a public records lawsuit filed by freelance journalist Brandon Smith, a judge last week ordered the city to release the video .\n\nThe graphic nature of the video has city leaders preparing for protests. Mayor Rahm Emanuel has called Van Dyke's actions \"hideous,\" and asked the city's religious and political leaders to urge peaceful protests. But several leaders told the Tribune that Emanuel and the city have handled the situation poorly and that people in the community feel betrayed and angry.\n\n\"There is a group that is not listening to him and not listening to us either, but nevertheless we are hoping these protests and demonstrations will be peaceful,\" the Rev. Ira Acree, a pastor at the Greater St. John Bible Church in Chicago, told the Tribune. \"But we know they are coming, because if there was no protest that would mean we've become immune to this madness.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "A Florida Cop Killed Tony McDade. Now He's Hiding Behind a Law Meant to Protect Victims.\n\nMother Jones illustration; Getty\n\nLaura Thompson June 23, 2020\n\nThe shooting death of Tony McDade followed a painfully familiar formula. On the morning of May 27, two days after George Floyd's life was stamped out under the knee of Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, Tallahassee police responded to a report of a fatal stabbing on a residential street on the south side of town. McDade, a Black transgender man, was identified as a suspect. When an officer chased after him, McDade pulled a gun and \"made a move consistent with using the firearm against the officer,\" according to a statement from police. The cop pulled the trigger. Witnesses claim the officer, who they say is white, never attempted to deescalate the encounter before resorting to lethal force .\n\nIt was after the shooting that things got peculiar. Unlike Chauvin, Darren Wilson (the Ferguson police officer who killed Michael Brown in 2014), Daniel Pantaleo (the NYPD officer who killed Eric Garner that same year) and countless others, the identity of the officer who shot McDade has been kept a secret. The Tallahassee Police Department says he is the victim of a crime-the alleged attempt by McDade to shoot him-and his identity should therefore be protected. Thanks to a victims'-rights amendment added to Florida's constitution in 2018, the police say, the officer who killed McDade has a right to privacy.\n\nMcDade \"ambushed\" the officer, the Florida Police Benevolent Association said in an injunction to keep the officer's identity under wraps. Immediately after the shooting, the association said, \"he was threatened by persons who were on the scene, and there has been ongoing animosity expressed against him on social media since he was forced to defend his own life.\"\n\nThe motion continued: \"His fear for his safety is reasonable, especially given the current unrest that has followed in the wake of George Floyd's death in Minneapolis. As such, one cannot reasonably question [John] Doe's fear that the release of his personal information will give rise to potential harassment of him and/or his family.\"\n\nCritics of the police response, who include LGBTQ advocates, local and national press, and First Amendment groups, argue that they are misapplying the law-known as Marsy's Law-to protect themselves from increased scrutiny. Even the city is skeptical of the victimhood claim.\n\nIn response to the injunction, the city's attorney explained that law enforcement has a lower expectation of privacy than regular citizens while on duty, and \"an officer's ability to avoid public scrutiny and accountability by claiming confidentiality under Marsy's Law is directly contradictory to the public's First Amendment 'right to gather information about what public officials do on public property.'\"\n\nNow, with frustrations about police brutality boiling over in Tallahassee, as well as the rest of the country, the PBA has vowed to \"exhaust every legal resource\" to keep the officer's name from getting out.\n\nTransparency and police accountability go hand in hand. Video of Rodney King being brutally beaten by police in 1991 helped spur the officers' arrest. The Black Lives Matter Movement rapidly rose to national prominence after a cellphone video of Garner being choked to death by NYPD was made public. Reporting on Chauvin's record of brutality in Minneapolis contributed to the fury over how easy it is for cops to get away with violence. Making body camera footage and use-of-force data available to the public has become a pillar of modern police reform.\n\nOf course, the Trump administration has done its best to roll back police accountability measures. The administration has been unwilling to investigate police departments, and in 2018, Attorney General Jeff Sessions gutted the federal government's ability to enter into and enforce consent decrees-contracts that give Department of Justice watchdogs strict oversight of ailing police departments. Without any kind of federal control, attempts by police to shield themselves behind vague privacy claims and public records exemptions deserve more scrutiny now than ever.\n\nDr. Henry T. Nicholas III and his mother, Marcella Leach, at the Orange County Victims' Rights March and Rally in 2013, in Santa Ana, Calif.\n\nBret Hartman/AP Images for Marsy's Law For All\n\nMarsy's Law is the Tallahassee PD's way of protecting the officer who shot McDade. But the law is is not unique to Florida. Ten other states-California, Georgia, Illinois, Nevada, North Dakota, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Wisconsin-all have Marsy's Law, otherwise known as the \"victims' bill of rights,\" on the books, guaranteeing that victims are notified of (and allowed to attend) criminal proceedings related to their case, given the opportunity to submit victim impact statements, and offered privacy and \"reasonable protection\" from the defendant, among other things.\n\nIt's named for Marsalee \"Marsy\" Nicholas, who was stalked and killed by her ex-boyfriend in 1983. The perpetrator was speedily arrested, but he just as quickly made bond. Marsy's family bumped into him at the supermarket on their way home from her funeral. No one had notified them of his release.\n\nThe encounter infuriated Marsy's brother, Henry Nicholas. In the years that followed, Nicholas made billions as the co-founder of Broadcom, the company that makes the semiconductors for iPhones and other smartphones. He began supporting the growing movement to get additional rights for crime victims codified into law and opposing criminal justice reforms that offered relief to offenders. In 2004, Nicholas funneled $3.5 million into the campaign to defeat California's Proposition 66, which sought to limit the state's \"three strikes law.\" In 2008, he shifted his focus to bankrolling the campaign to get California to adopt a victims' bill of rights.\n\nThe next year, Marsy's Law for All was born. Since then, Nicholas has poured nearly $100 million into campaigns to enact Marsy's Law across the country. According to Marsy's Law for All, approximately one third of Americans live in states with Marsy's Law protections.\n\nEfforts to pass Marsy's Law centered on the idea of letting the family of victims be more involved in the criminal justice process-that police officers have started using it is just one of the law's several unintended consequences.\n\n\"It certainly is alarming in light of what's going on now,\" said Cynthia Roseberry, the deputy director of policy for the ACLU's Justice Division. \"Had it not been for this video in Minneapolis, the narrative created by the officer would have stood-he said [Floyd] was resisting arrest. And that narrative is what could trigger that Marsy's Law protection.\" (Minnesota has not yet adopted a Marsy's Law amendment.)\n\nMarsy's Law and the victims' rights movement more broadly exist in some tension with the growing efforts to overhaul the criminal justice system. That a law designed for victims might be used for reactionary ends isn't as strange as it might seem. The victims' rights movement was the child of 1970s-era radical feminism and of the backlash to the Warren Court, which in the 1960s had dramatically expanded the rights of defendants. A language of therapy and social justice was wedded to a lock-'em-up approach to crime. Today, in the name of victims' rights, prosecutors may push for harsher sentences; juries may be less likely to consider exculpatory evidence; and victims (or their families) may advocate against the defendant being released on parole. The underlying assumption is that justice for victims almost always means arrest and incarceration for the accused.\n\nThings may be changing. \"Actually, a lot of victim rights groups are now filled with people who are talking in very different ways about criminal punishment,\" said Mariame Kaba, the director of Project NIA and an outspoken prison abolitionist, in a 2019 interview with MSNBC's Chris Hayes. \"This is true in New York State where people are now saying things like: 'We don't want to be locking everybody up. This is not the way we're going to solve it.' Because guess what, they've had years of seeing how that policy's actually not worked for anybody in a good way.\"\n\nNonetheless, Marsy's Law continues to make it on ballots across the country, including in Wisconsin, where it was overwhelmingly approved by voters in the state's April primary.\n\nCritics, who range from defense attorneys to the ACLU and the Cato Institute, have been concerned about Marsy's Law from the beginning. They say the laws are overly broad, inherently punitive, and constitute a due process violation for the accused. For example, maintaining a victim's privacy can limit a defense attorney's ability to gather evidence to build their case.\n\n\"While considerate treatment of victims is important,\" Cato Institute fellow Walter Olson wrote last year , \"it is dangerous to let the conduct and timing of criminal process itself depend too much on their wishes....The function of criminal prosecution cannot be to validate the victim's suffering. It must instead be to ascertain the truth as best as possible and impartially carry out the legal consequences on the guilty.\"\n\nIn a legal memo challenging the constitutionality of Marsy's Law in Illinois, prominent Chicago defense attorney Andrea Lyon writes: \"When the victim's state constitutional rights conflict with a defendant's federal constitutional rights to due process and effective cross-examination, the alleged victim's rights must yield.\"\n\nLyon told me that when police invoke Marsy's Law, it tips the scales of justice even further to the disadvantage of a defendant. In her more-than-40-year career Lyon has defended hundreds of clients, including some who have survived police shootings, only to be charged with attempted murder of an officer. \"It's really quite common,\" she said. When police claim victimhood, it makes it incredibly difficult for the defendant to claim self-defense. And without access to an officer's personnel reports, it's almost impossible to prove a pattern of brutality-it becomes a defendant's word against law enforcement's. And who do people usually believe?\n\n\"Your client-who most often is not a white person, not a person of privilege, not someone that your jury identifies with-all he's left to say is, 'He started it,'\" Lyon said. \"And here's the officer saying, 'No, I didn't.'\"\n\nAnd while no one I talked to said cops should never be considered victims, allowing officers who use lethal force on duty to claim the same privacy rights as private citizens sets a dangerous precedent.\n\nComprehensive data on how often police have used Marsy's Law is almost nonexistent. In Florida, a recent investigation from the Tampa Bay Times found a mixed bag when it comes to classifying cops as victims. Some agencies, such as the Pasco County Sheriff's Office in central Florida, automatically apply Marsy's Law to on-duty officers who use force in response to violence from a suspect. The St. Petersburg Police Department only withholds officer's name at their request. The sheriff in Pinellas County (which includes St. Petersburg) told the Times he doesn't apply Marsy's Law to his deputies because \"this is what we do. If you don't want to be transparent, if you don't want to be forthright, then don't sign up for the job.\"\n\nIn Tallahassee, officers have been involved in three civilian deaths since March, including McDade's. Only one officer has been identified.\n\nOfficers in the Dakotas have also shielded themselves with victims' rights. According to a 2018 investigation by the Grand Forks Herald , since North Dakota enacted Marsy's Law in 2016, there had been at least eight police shootings in the state. In almost all of them, police claimed victimhood and invoked their right to keep under wraps \"information or records that could be used to locate or harass a victim or the victim's family\"-including their names and prior disciplinary reports-until the investigation into the shooting was complete. Multiple law enforcement officers in South Dakota have also invoked Marsy's Law to keep their identities confidential, including the Pennington County sheriff's deputy who shot and killed a fleeing suspect in November 2018 .\n\nIn Illinois, Lyon told me, law enforcement has never invoked Marsy's Law on behalf of an officer. Neither have police officers in California, thanks at least in part to a 2014 state Supreme Court ruling that declared the names of officers involved in on-duty shootings to be public record. (Though the case was not based on a Marsy's Law challenge.) Garrett Rolfe, the Atlanta police officer who fatally shot Rayshard Brooks on June 12, also has not claimed victim's rights.\n\nThough the laws are relatively new, the strategy is one of the oldest in the policing handbook. By obfuscating public information, police officers have literally gotten away with murder .\n\n\"Failure to hold police accountable, by not investigating the cases, not prosecuting the cases and by granting qualified immunity in addition to vilifying the deceased, are evidence of a longstanding tradition, an agreement if you will,\" Roseberry said. \"Invoke the magic word 'victim' and you can kill at will.\"\n\nSaturday, June 6 , was a rainy day in Florida's capital. A few hours after McDade's family said their final goodbyes at a graveside service, the city's top brass met with several hundred police officers in the parking garage outside City Hall to discuss releasing the name of the officer who shot McDade. In the previous 10 days, the city government had been flooded with public records requests to release the name or other material that could shed light on the incident, like body camera footage for the handful of officers who were either there or responded to the scene.\n\n\"There are all types of stories going on as far as what happened, and what didn't happen, and what he had or what he didn't have,\" Mutaqee Akbar, the McDade family's attorney, told Tallahassee's local ABC affiliate station . \"What's most important is this law enforcement officer is still on the streets. If [the video] shows that that law enforcement officer did something that was inappropriate we need to know right away whether he should still be on the streets or even on office duty.\"\n\nDays before the parking garage rendezvous, a Leon County judge had denied the PBA's request to block the release of the officer's identity, without ruling on the constitutionality of Marsy's Law. At the meeting on June 6, the city signaled that it would publish the name soon. Frustrated, about 100 officers stormed out .\n\nCity leadership capitulated, agreeing to hold off while the PBA continued to fight it in court. In their renewed petition to the court, the organization restates their belief that Marsy's Law should apply to law enforcement, and argues that such a position is only controversial because of the protests against police brutality that are raging across the country.\n\nIn a prior police shooting, which took place a week before McDade's death, the city \"interpreted Marsy's Law as applying to law enforcement officers who become a victim of crime while serving in their official capacity,\" the PBA wrote. \"[B]ut in the wake of the killing of George Floyd, the City has reversed its position on the applicability to police officers.\"\n\nThe court is expected to make a final ruling soon. In the meantime, a conglomerate of media organizations-including the Florida Press Association, the Miami Herald , and the New York Times -have filed a motion demanding the release of the officer's name. The local organization behind Marsy's Law in Florida has so far been hesitant to weigh in.\n\n\"Police officers who have become victims of crime deserve the same constitutional rights as everyone else,\" a spokesperson told Mother Jones in an emailed statement. \"But police officers who have committed crimes cannot hide behind Marsy's Law....The Marsy's Law provision of the constitution is clear when it says that the accused cannot also be a victim.\"\n\nThough the circumstances surrounding McDade's death are still unclear, numerous organizations , including the ACLU of Florida, Human Rights Campaign, and the National Black Justice Coalition, have called for a full investigation into the shooting. That starts by releasing the name of the officer.\n\n\"We don't know a lot of the details around Tony's death, or how police became involved. We do know that Tony should not have been killed,\" said NBJC executive director David J. Johns in a statement. \"We must also work to ensure that police officers understand they do not have a license to kill Black people, period.\n\n\"The world is watching.\"\n\nThis article has been updated to reflect changes to the Mother Jones style guide.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

Vice President Kamala Harris would join this tiny club.\n\nThe New York Times reported on the Democratic candidate 's professional background:\n\nIn 1987, she returned to California for law school, earning her degree at the University of California College of the Law, San Francisco. She then stayed in her home state, where she built a career as a prosecutor, first in the Bay Area and then statewide, ascending to increasingly influential offices. In her first role, she joined the Alameda County prosecutor's office in Oakland in 1990, where she specialized in prosecuting child sexual assault cases. Over the next several years, she rose first in that office and then in San Francisco.\n\nA Time magazine report added that Harris, who campaigned in the Golden State as California's \"top cop,\" also \"developed a tough-on-crime reputation as district attorney.\"\n\nThis wasn't a principal part of Harris' pitch during her 2020 campaign, but that's apparently about to change. In fact, it was just a couple of hours ago when the vice president's political operation issued a press statement with a headline that read in part , \"Donald Trump Won't Be the First Felon Kamala Harris Holds Accountable.\"\n\nFor Republicans, this creates a challenge.\n\nAt last week's Republican National Convention, Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird boasted about her party's approach to law enforcement: \"We put criminals where they belong: in jail.\" Montana Senate hopeful Tim Sheehy added , \"Cops are good, criminals are bad.\"\n\nMy personal favorite was a speech from House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, who said with a straight face , \"Donald Trump stands with the people and the police - our men and women in blue - not with the criminals and rioters.\" It was around this time when convention attendees waved pre-printed \"Back the Blue\" signs.\n\nAs we discussed soon after , there was a glaring problem with the rhetoric: A jury recently found Trump guilty of 34 felonies - which came on the heels of a different jury holding Trump liable for sexual assault - and the Republican happens to be running on a platform rooted in his support for rioters .\n\nBut after President Joe Biden announced his decision to withdraw from the 2024 race, the dynamic took on a greater significance. This isn't just a situation in which Republicans have nominated a criminal for the nation's highest office, it's also a situation in which the GOP candidate will likely face someone with a record of putting criminals behind bars.\n\nThe New York Times reported a few months ago on the \"complicated relationship\" between Trump and law enforcement, which touched on an underappreciated story .\n\nEmmer's rhetoric about the former president \"standing with the police\" notwithstanding, Trump has repeatedly lashed out at those he's described as \" dirty cops ,\" as part of a larger offensive against law enforcement . He's also condemned law enforcement officials as \" fascists \" and expressed support for prosecuting members of the Capitol police .\n\nJust as notably, Trump has promised pardons for insurrectionists, many of whom violently clashed with police officers .\n\nAnd that was before he prepared to take on a former prosecutor.\n\nComplicating matters, some of the top contenders for the Democratic vice presidential nomination - Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer - are also former prosecutors, raising the prospect of two former prosecutors taking on the first presidential candidate in American history to be convicted of a crime.\n\nThe Republican's crimes and condemnations of law enforcement haven't stopped multiple police unions from endorsing his 2024 candidacy - the first time in modern American history in which police unions have backed a criminal for national elected office - though it's an open question as to whether they might reconsider.\n\nAs for Trump, the former president said at a rally on Saturday : \"You're not going to teach a criminal not to be a criminal.\"\n\nDon't be surprised if Team Harris puts that quote to use in the coming weeks and months.\n\nSteve Benen is a producer for \"The Rachel Maddow Show,\" the editor of MaddowBlog and an MSNBC political contributor.

Kyle Kennedy said at an evening news conference.\n\nA pursuit ensued and at one point the suspect lost control of the vehicle he was driving and exchanged gunfire with pursuing troopers, Kennedy said. No injuries were reported, and the chase continued south, he said.\n\nAfter approaching slow traffic, Huizar hit a stopped vehicle and spun into a median, the captain said. Huizar's car then became immobile and, as troopers \"contacted\" the vehicle, the suspect shot himself in the head, Kennedy said.\n\nThe 1-year-old boy Huizar had allegedly kidnapped was safely taken by troopers, Kennedy said. Authorities did not detail how they believed the child was kidnapped.\n\nNo injuries were reported in the second and final crash about 25 miles from the start of the chase, the captain said.\n\n\"Today was a worst-case scenario for us - having a murder suspect in the same vehicle as an innocent juvenile,\" Kennedy said. \"That brings everything up another level for us. It's a zero-sum game for us. We're thankful for the way it turned out.\"\n\nHuizar was charged with first-degree murder in Monday's slaying of Amber Rodriguez, 31, at Wiley Elementary School in West Richland as classes were being let out shortly before 3:30 p.m., Benton County Prosecutor Eric Eisinger said during a Tuesday afternoon news conference.\n\nThe charge of murder includes an aggravated circumstance allegation of domestic violence, as well as a firearm enhancement, Eisinger said.\n\nHuizar was also being investigated in the death of a woman whose body was discovered later Monday when authorities searched his home. That victim has not been identified but was described in an Amber Alert from Washington State Patrol as Huizar's girlfriend.\n\nAccording to a court document filed against Huizar on Monday, witnesses at Wiley Elementary School said a gunman wearing black clothing and a black hat shot Rodriguez. Eight .40-caliber bullet casings were recovered at the scene. Rodriguez was identified after the killing in part through her school employee ID, the documents said.\n\nThe pair's 9-year-old son witnessed the shooting, according to the court filing. The former husband and wife have two children together, according to court documents.\n\nAt the time of the shooting at the school, Huizar was under conditional freedom after being accused of third-degree rape of a child and second-degree rape, Eisinger said. His total bail had been set at $250,000, the prosecutor noted.\n\nAccording to a separate court filing about Huizar's alleged rapes, two teens went to police in early February after a 17-year-old girl - whom prosecutors in the filing said identified herself as Huizar's girlfriend - told officers she woke up to Huizar performing oral sex on her 16-year-old friend, who was \"passed out\" after all three had been drinking alcohol.\n\nHuizar and the 17-year-old \"have a child in common,\" the filing said. Huizar met her when he was a resource officer at her middle school and got her pregnant when she was 15 years old, court records said.\n\nThe teen took the baby and drove off with her 16-year-old friend after February's alleged incident, before flagging down police, the court filing said.\n\nWashington State Patrol on Monday had issued an Amber Alert for the 1-year-old. The state patrol had said Huizar and the boy shared the same last name, but the relationship between them was not immediately clear Tuesday afternoon. It was also not immediately clear whether the child was the same one Huizar had with the 17-year-old.\n\nThe alert was extended from Washington to Oregon as well as other places in the west, Eisinger said. The alert also said the women killed were Huizar's ex-wife and his girlfriend.\n\nKennedy said Oregon State Police received a request to issue the alert about 10:30 p.m. Monday and put it into effect about an hour later.\n\nThe West Richland Police Department said earlier that Huizar was \"armed and considered dangerous, and is likely to commit more crimes.\" Portland police told West Richland authorities that Huizar was seen in the Oregon city overnight, possibly driving a black sedan.\n\nThe Yakima Police Department in Washington said Huizar was an officer there from 2013 to 2022.\n\n\"He did serve as a school resource officer for a period of time, at a couple schools during his employment. Mr. Huizar resigned in February of 2022, immediately following discipline,\" a department spokesperson said.\n\nShelley Redinger, superintendent of the Richland School District, said Huizar passed background checks and answered no to questions that included whether he had ever resigned from an employer with allegations of misconduct pending or if he'd ever been the subject of a workplace investigation accusing him of misconduct.\n\nRedinger said Huizar's last day as a district employee was in June 2023.\n\n\"We are extremely disheartened. That information about his past was not disclosed to us,\" she said. \"It is expectation for individuals who apply for employment with the Richland school district to be forthcoming and truthful in their applications.\"\n\nI am an award-winning journalist lucky enough to work in some of the greatest news towns in the country: Las Vegas, Boston, Long Island and New York City.

They all were then shot in the back of the head.\n\nThose three men just happened to be with Martin Luna when the kidnapping occurred.\n\nThey were killed \"because they witnessed Martin's murder and were in the wrong place at the wrong time,\" prosecutors wrote in a sentencing letter, in which they called Tartaglione's offenses \"monstrous.\"\n\nThe bodies of all four men were buried on Tartaglione's property in Otisville in upstate New York, officials said. An FBI task force found the bodies in December 2021.\n\nTartaglione was sentenced Monday to four life sentences, which are to run consecutively.\n\nHis attorney, Inga Parsons, said they are appealing and will continue to fight to show Tartaglione's innocence.\n\nIn March, Tartaglione filed a motion through his attorney for a new trial, arguing that his legal counsel failed to challenge crucial evidence, as well as other missteps. Tartaglione said he was innocent.\n\nThe judge denied the motion for a new trial, records show.\n\nTartaglione is a former police officer and body builder who sold steroids to other body builders in the Hudson Valley area, prosecutors said, including to two people who assisted in the kidnapping and killings, Joseph Biggs and Gerard Benderoth.\n\nBiggs, Tartaglione and Benderoth each shot one of the three men they'd forced to kneel, according to prosecutors.\n\n\"Under Tartaglione's direction, Urbano, Miguel, and Hector were forced out of the car and onto their knees at gunpoint. Then one by one, each was executed,\" prosecutors wrote in the sentencing letter. \"The terror the last victim to die must have felt borders on the incomprehensible.\"\n\nAs the four victims remained missing, their families reported their disappearance to police, which eventually led to the FBI task force's finding their bodies.\n\nBenderoth has died. Biggs pleaded guilty and in April was sentenced to more than 16 years in prison.\n\nTwo other men, Jason Sullivan and Marcos Cruz, were also involved and pleaded guilty. Sullivan was sentenced last week to 10 years in prison, and Cruz was sentenced in November to time already served.\n\nI am a breaking news reporter working nights in Los Angeles.

The bill for the Global North will come to $300 billion per year by 2035. This is a fraction of the $1.3 trillion in annual grants that developing countries were pushing to begin immediately. It is only a marginal increase from the $250 billion offered in an earlier version of the agreement, released the final scheduled day of the summit. The climate-financing agreement was reached in the early hours of Sunday morning, well after the scheduled end on Friday of the two-week climate summit held in Baku. The deal marked an end to a climate summit marred by chaos and bitterness and which one negotiator called the \"worst COP in recent memory.\"\n\nExperts estimate that $1.3 trillion a year is what it would cost to avoid surpassing the planet's 1.5-degree Celsius temperature threshold that was set in the 2015 Paris climate agreements. This level of funding is what's needed to invest in energy transitions in addition to what is already being spent.\n\nDelegates from across the Global South slammed the final deal. The African Group of Negotiators described the final pledge as \"too little, too late.\" A delegate from India, Chandni Raina, dismissed the amount as a \"paltry sum\" and the document as \" little more than an optical illusion \" designed to appease developing nations but which in reality deflects responsibility away from historical polluters. Developing nations from Asia, the South Pacific, Africa, and South America all echoed these remarks.\n\n\"The outcome of COP29 is nothing short of heartbreaking,\" said Juan Carlos Monterrey Gomez, Panama's climate envoy. \"It feels as if we have signed away the 1.5-degree target-our only real chance to safeguard humanity's future.\"\n\nThis year COP was meant to address perhaps the most important question plaguing the climate-change movement: Who's going to pay to stop climate change? Billed as the \"finance COP,\" negotiators were set with a task to clarify the money question. The last agreed number was from COP15 in 2009, where countries agreed to $100 billion paid to developing nations from 2020 to 2025 and which countries failed to honor.\n\nIn the meantime, money for climate financing has often been delivered piecemeal to nations with the highest needs. There is widespread acknowledgement that this approach is unsustainable. Domestic political volatility around the world can turn the funding tap on and off. The United States is a perfect example, with the incoming Trump administration likely to obliterate any climate-financing hopes.\n\nThe transition to net zero is an enormously expensive global project, which has long stalled due to a lack of financing. At the end of the first week of the two-week climate summit, a report released by economists at COP29 said that the \"projected investment requirement for climate action\" would be a whopping $6.3-6.7 trillion per year by 2030, divided roughly evenly between \"advanced economies,\" China, and other nations, and after 2035, that number would jump to $7-8.1 trillion per year. Climate activists throughout the summit had been calling on a deal in which developed countries pay $5 trillion per year, although many admitted that this number would not be achieved this year.\n\nTo put that number into perspective: The entire US federal budget for 2024 was $6.75 trillion . Germany, the next-largest Western economy, and the third-largest in the world after the US and China, has a federal budget of just under $0.5 trillion . The GDP of the entire world is estimated at roughly $100 trillion.\n\nThe deal crucially does not delineate what amount of funding goes to \"mitigation,\" i.e., carbon emissions reduction (of which 90 percent of climate financing is currently dedicated to) or what amount goes to \"adaptation,\" which is the term used to describe building resilient infrastructure to adapt to climate change.\n\nMissing also is a much-requested clarification and expansion of a \"loss and damage\" fund. Established two years ago at COP27 in Sharm el-Sheik, Egypt, a dozen countries pledged $720 million-a sum that UN Secretary General António Guterres dismissed as inadequate and \"roughly the annual salary of the world's 10 best-paid footballers.\" According to World Bank figures, the floods in Pakistan alone in 2022 caused between $30 billion and $40 billion in damage and losses.A review of a mechanism to provide funding for natural disasters came to no conclusion and has been postponed until COP30 next year in Brazil.\n\nThroughout the summit, negotiations focused on who should bear responsibility for climate change, as industrialized nations who have benefited from centuries of colonization have been and continue to be the world's largest carbon emitters. It is not an uncommon scenario for a developing nation to be inundated with climate-financing debts-taking out loans just to pay back the interest on their original loans. And for countries experiencing massive infrastructure damage from natural disasters, the bureaucracy around a recovery grant could take years to materialize, when the funding for reconstruction or even just disaster alleviation is often urgently needed.\n\nOn the last scheduled day, representatives from the 39 aligned countries and territories represented by Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) walked out of climate talks after dismissing the original proposed deal of $250 billion annually from developed nations. This was the first time in the 29-year history of COP talks that AOSIS has walked out of negotiations. Michai Roberts, the lead negotiator for AOSIS, reportedly said that the other countries were \"laughing at them\" for asking for more money to confront the consequences of climate change.\n\n\"We came here to this COP for a fair deal,\" Cedric Schuster of AOSIS told reporters. \"There is a deal to be made, and we are not being consulted.\"\n\nIn the late hours of the negotiation, US and European leaders worked to secure a deal. \"The need is great, the offer on the table from donor countries is high, so hopefully we will pull something together,\" John Podesta, the US climate envoy, said. Sue Biniaz, a veteran US climate negotiator, conferred with developing nation leaders and maneuvered a series of changes to appease those most frustrated by the $250 billion number originally proposed. Debt-inducing loans would be discouraged while the deal would be up for review and expansion in 2030.\n\nElie Mystal\n\nFeature / Vincent Bevins\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nSophie Lewis\n\n\"COP29 will be remembered as the start of a new era on climate finance. The EU will continue to lead,\" EU's climate envoy Wopke Hoekstra said. \"This COP delivered an ambitious and realistic goal and an increased contributor base. With these funds and this structure, we are confident we'll reach the $1.3 trillion.\"\n\nThere were a lot of ideas floated to find financing for climate change, but none that were ever likely to be adopted by the end of this COP. Ideas for a \" global solidarity levy \" were floated by a group headed by Barbados, France, and Kenya, but did not materialize into substantial commitments. Nor did a proposal to tax cryptocurrency or AI , though the carbon emissions of each industry alone could be sufficient to push global warming beyond Paris Agreement goals.\n\nBut perhaps the negotiations were doomed from the start. Most government leaders and negotiators were from environmental or climate ministries, not finance or treasury, who are often the real holders of countries' purse strings. And while the negotiators from Washington tried to find compromises in the depths of Baku Olympic Stadium, there was speculation as to whether President Donald Trump would lead the United States out of the Paris Agreement or out of the UN sector responsible for climate policy altogether. China, the world's largest foreign-currency holder, has become the leading emitter without participating in the UN's official climate financing and maintains that it could not and will not fill the gap left by the United States. The Europeans would also not commit to compensating for an absent US. The next EU Commission will probably stay the course on climate protection rather than set new goals, and among its member states, support for an ambitious climate policy is weaker than it was even a few years ago.\n\nThen there has been the ongoing debate over loans versus grants. Developing countries have been consistent in their calls for primarily grant-based funding rather than loans. While developing nations insist that this is not charity, for wealthy nations that's been a hard sell. The current deal has said that the $1.3 trillion goal may yet be accomplished via an indetermined mix of public and private financing-a far cry from the guarantee of non-debt-inducing funds that developing nations called for.\n\nAccording to a long-outdated UN classification from 1992, neither the rich producing countries such as the Emirates nor major emitters such as China are considered developed countries and are therefore not asked to pay for the financing.\n\nControversially, dependence on international carbon markets, centered on the trade of \"carbon credits,\" seems to have solidified as a solution to climate change. This means that wealthy countries can \"offset\" their carbon emissions by funding, for example, climate adaptation or renewable energy in less-developed nations, essentially buying their way out of penalties for carbon emissions. During COP29, the last states gave up their resistance to the principles of international carbon markets.\n\nMany dissatisfied participants are now looking forward to the 2025 climate summit planned in Brazil. Home to the Amazon rainforest, Brazil stores as much carbon dioxide as humanity produces in 15 to 20 years. Agnès Pannier-Runacher, the French Minister for Energy and Climate, was the most outspoken on Sunday: \"This COP, more broadly, was marked by real disorganization and a lack of leadership from the presidency,\" she said. \"Our hopes now turn to COP30, which is being led by Brazil.\"\n\nBut there seems to be a silver lining: Both Europe and the United States have at least recognized that the Paris Agreement cannot continue under the current global financial structure. The text of the agreement calls on countries to spend more-triple their original $100 billion goal-even if that number is far lower than what developing nations need. Lenders are urged to provide lower-interest loans to the most vulnerable nations, and a \"Baku to Bélem road map\" promises to explore the kinds of broad taxes laid out by groups calling for global wealth taxes and taxes on polluting tech industries, for example.\n\nThe Unites States, China, and Europe have forced these costs on them by heating up the earth with their emissions. The countries of the Global South will not forget that they have hardly taken any responsibility for this. Many feel that the COP29 decision may keep the multilateral system barely afloat, while failing to address the crisis. This does not bode well for the climate conferences to come.\n\n\"The lack of ambition and urgency is a betrayal of science, morality, and responsibility,\" Monterrey Gomez, the Panamanian climate envoy, said.\n\n\"We cannot rely on the goodwill of those who have failed us time and again,\" he continued. \"This is not a question of convenience; it is a question of survival.\"\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

One hundred and twenty heads of state will join, including President Biden, who attended briefly on Friday and will attend again after the G20 for the final days. The climate talks focus, as usual, on nations' commitments to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and on transferring funding and technology from developed to developing countries. But this year's climate conference, also known as the Conference of the Parties or COP 27, addresses two additional issues: compensation from developed to developing countries for loss and damages incurred due to climate change; and human rights violations in Egypt under the current authoritarian regime. According to the Paris Agreement , which was adopted in 2015, nations from around the world will work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (ghgs) to limit global warming to 1.5 Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit), a commitment that was renewed at last year's COP 26 in Glasgow. The ghg reductions to achieve that goal are known as \"Nationally Determined Contributions\" (NDCs), which are then tallied by the UN to ascertain the collective reduction. The climate accord stipulated that nations must provide details about how much they will reduce their ghgs and by when. Initially, nations were to put forward these NDCs by 2020 and then submit new NDCs every five years. But at last year's COP 26, it was proposed that the NDCs be submitted annually, both to keep nations on track with their commitments and to increase the pressure to ratchet up commitments more frequently, given that action must be taken by 2030 to avoid the irreversible impacts of climate change. As COP 27 kicked off, only 24 of almost 200 nations have submitted new or updated climate plans. Last month, the UN Environment Programme's \" Emissions Gap Report 2022 \" showed that the current commitments to ghg reductions were insufficient, currently putting the world on a path of 2.8 C by the century's end. Related Article Debt and Inequality Will Be Key Issues at the UN's Next Climate Conference Tina Gerhardt At the UN climate conferences, nations of the Global North and of the Global South often clash, since the former have historically benefited and continue to benefit from, among other things, the burning of fossil fuels, while nations from the Global South have already been disproportionately experiencing the impacts of the climate crisis, ranging from floods to heat waves to drought, though they have contributed the least to CO 2 emissions. In 2009, Global North nations agreed to pay $200 billion per year by 2020 for mitigation technologies (to help reduce emissions) and adaptation programs (to address the impacts of climate change; for example, protecting existing and restoring mangroves and coral and oyster reefs, or managed retreat), but the Global North has failed on this commitment.

These moneys would come from a variety of sources, so this report is not demanding that sum from the UN alone. But it does point out that the issue of climate justice must address historical and present-day inequities. Meanwhile, the impacts of climate change have continued unabated, so nations in the Global South have been increasingly focused on demanding compensation to address those impacts, pointing out that they have already been suffering. At least year's COP 26, they pushed for a mechanism for compensation to be created. In what was a first, a draft of the agreement included language acknowledging \"loss and damages,\" but this, to the outrage of nations from the Global South, was struck from the final agreement. And the opening of this year's UN climate conference was delayed in large part because of the insistence that loss and damages remains a topic. It is now on the agenda. Current Issue View our current issue Nations from the Global North are concerned about establishing a fund for loss and damages, since they would become legally liable for climate crisis damages, which the majority of the globe is already experiencing and which will only increase. The demand for compensation for loss and damages pushes the legacy of colonialism and resulting global economic inequalities to the forefront. Although no major agreement is expected t0 come out of this year's COP, the issue is sure to dominate the negotiations. A t this year's COP 27, attention is also focused on human rights violations of the authoritarian regime of Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. In 2013, then-Gen. El-Sisi toppled Mohamed Morsi, Egypt's first democratically elected leader, who came into office after the Arab Spring forced Hosni Mubarak to resign in 2011. El Sisi, who has been president since 2014, has banned protests and free speech. In 2019, a law came into effect restricting both. Organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have for years been calling out the crackdowns. To date, over 60,000 dissidents have been arrested and imprisoned. This explosion of arrests of dissidents has prompted a spree in the construction of prisons; one-third of Egypt's prisons have been built during El-Sisi's regime. Alaa Abd El Fattah, a pro-democracy British-Egyptian activist who has been in prison for nine years for speaking up about human rights violations and who has been on a hunger strike for over 200 days, which he escalated to drinking no water as COP 27 began. He is protesting his prison conditions and demanding his release as well as the release of other political prisoners. Fifteen Nobel Laureates have called for El Fattah to be freed. According to the Egyptian-based media organization Mada Masr , as of October, hundreds have been arrested in Egypt in their homes and workplaces and on the street. They are being held in pretrial detention, accused of \"spreading false news and joining a banned group.\" Many global climate and human rights activists who have spoken up in support of El Fattah are from countries under authoritarian regimes. This shines the spotlight on the twinned repercussions of authoritarian regimes: They are often as detrimental to human rights as they are to the planet. As Putin invaded Ukraine and Biden imposed sanctions on Russia, leaders of authoritarian regimes such as Xi Jinping of China and Narendra Modri of India swooped in to buy gas and oil from Russia. (Neither Putin nor Xi Jinping plan to attend COP 27.) And environmental activists are at great risk in authoritarian-led nations. According to a report published by Global Witness in September, over 1,700 environmental activists have been killed over the past decade, with the largest numbers in Brazil, Colombia, the Philippines, Mexico, and Honduras. Activists from Indigenous communities are disproportionately impacted, making up 39 percent of those killed, though they are only 5 percent of the global population. At COP 27, both human rights and environmental justice will remain at the forefront.\n\nThe climate talks focus, as usual, on nations' commitments to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and on transferring funding and technology from developed to developing countries.

He is protesting his prison conditions and demanding his release as well as the release of other political prisoners. Fifteen Nobel Laureates have called for El Fattah to be freed. According to the Egyptian-based media organization Mada Masr , as of October, hundreds have been arrested in Egypt in their homes and workplaces and on the street. They are being held in pretrial detention, accused of \"spreading false news and joining a banned group.\" Many global climate and human rights activists who have spoken up in support of El Fattah are from countries under authoritarian regimes. This shines the spotlight on the twinned repercussions of authoritarian regimes: They are often as detrimental to human rights as they are to the planet. As Putin invaded Ukraine and Biden imposed sanctions on Russia, leaders of authoritarian regimes such as Xi Jinping of China and Narendra Modri of India swooped in to buy gas and oil from Russia. (Neither Putin nor Xi Jinping plan to attend COP 27.) And environmental activists are at great risk in authoritarian-led nations. According to a report published by Global Witness in September, over 1,700 environmental activists have been killed over the past decade, with the largest numbers in Brazil, Colombia, the Philippines, Mexico, and Honduras. Activists from Indigenous communities are disproportionately impacted, making up 39 percent of those killed, though they are only 5 percent of the global population. At COP 27, both human rights and environmental justice will remain at the forefront.\n\nInitially, nations were to put forward these NDCs by 2020 and then submit new NDCs every five years. But at last year's COP 26, it was proposed that the NDCs be submitted annually, both to keep nations on track with their commitments and to increase the pressure to ratchet up commitments more frequently, given that action must be taken by 2030 to avoid the irreversible impacts of climate change. As COP 27 kicked off, only 24 of almost 200 nations have submitted new or updated climate plans. Last month, the UN Environment Programme's \" Emissions Gap Report 2022 \" showed that the current commitments to ghg reductions were insufficient, currently putting the world on a path of 2.8 C by the century's end. Related Article Debt and Inequality Will Be Key Issues at the UN's Next Climate Conference Tina Gerhardt At the UN climate conferences, nations of the Global North and of the Global South often clash, since the former have historically benefited and continue to benefit from, among other things, the burning of fossil fuels, while nations from the Global South have already been disproportionately experiencing the impacts of the climate crisis, ranging from floods to heat waves to drought, though they have contributed the least to CO 2 emissions. In 2009, Global North nations agreed to pay $200 billion per year by 2020 for mitigation technologies (to help reduce emissions) and adaptation programs (to address the impacts of climate change; for example, protecting existing and restoring mangroves and coral and oyster reefs, or managed retreat), but the Global North has failed on this commitment.

These moneys would come from a variety of sources, so this report is not demanding that sum from the UN alone. But it does point out that the issue of climate justice must address historical and present-day inequities. Meanwhile, the impacts of climate change have continued unabated, so nations in the Global South have been increasingly focused on demanding compensation to address those impacts, pointing out that they have already been suffering. At least year's COP 26, they pushed for a mechanism for compensation to be created. In what was a first, a draft of the agreement included language acknowledging \"loss and damages,\" but this, to the outrage of nations from the Global South, was struck from the final agreement. And the opening of this year's UN climate conference was delayed in large part because of the insistence that loss and damages remains a topic. It is now on the agenda. Current Issue View our current issue Nations from the Global North are concerned about establishing a fund for loss and damages, since they would become legally liable for climate crisis damages, which the majority of the globe is already experiencing and which will only increase. The demand for compensation for loss and damages pushes the legacy of colonialism and resulting global economic inequalities to the forefront. Although no major agreement is expected t0 come out of this year's COP, the issue is sure to dominate the negotiations.

And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

This year's UN climate negotiations called on nations, for the first time ever, to transition \"away from fossil fuels in energy systems .\" After nearly three decades of climate conferences, member states have finally named the culprit of the climate crisis-fossil fuels-and committed to a transition away from them. \"For the first time in three decades of climate negotiations the words fossil fuels have made it into a COP outcome,\" said Mohamed Adow, of Power Shift Africa. \"The genie is never going back into the bottle and future COPs will only turn the screws even more on dirty energy.\" UN Secretary General António Guterres said , \"Whether you like it or not, [a] fossil fuel phase out is inevitable. Let's hope it doesn't come too late.\" But there is much more beneath the sound bite. While the inclusion of \"fossil fuels\" is historic, not demanding a \"phase out\" of fossil fuels-which over 140 nations at COP 28 pushed for-and or detailing how to transition, and by what year-leaves the agreement without teeth. A \"phase out of fossil fuels\" was in an original draft, then watered down to a \"phase-down\" and then further diluted to the \"transitioning away.\" This mention of fossil fuels marks a significant turn from previous years' conferences, when the attempt to include fossil fuels was thwarted. And this year, too, there was stiff opposition to naming fossil fuels. Saudi Arabia was adamant about keeping the focus on emissions rather than the source of them. Early in the negotiations, OPEC Secretary General Haitham Al Ghais sent a letter to OPE's 13 members and the 10 Russian-led allies urging them to reject inclusion of language that mentioned fossil fuels rather than emissions. So in this sense, its inclusion marks a victory.

Anne Rasmussen, chair of the Alliance of Small Islands States (AOSIS), pointed out that 39 small-island developing states (SIDS) were not even in the room when the document coming out of COP 28, called the \"Global Stocktake\" (GST), was approved by President Al Jaber. Low-lying island nations are frontline communities who are intensely at risk, are already experiencing the impacts of the climate crisis, have contributed the least to it in terms of emissions and have been most vocal about insisting on preserving policies and actions are taken to ensure that the UN negotiations keep global warming from exceeding 1.5 Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). The 1.5 limit was enshrined in the 2015 Paris Agreement and has since been the guiding or North Star for the talks and action. \"1.5 to Stay Alive!,\" as Tony de Brum, the late Climate Envoy of the Republic of the Marshall Islands put it, is the mantra of low-lying island nations. That said, according to NASA , the average global temperature has already increased by 1.11o C since 1880, with most of the increase since 1975. And we are currently on a path to 3.3o C according to a 2023 UNEP report , unless we drastically reduce the use of fossil fuels.

We reference the science throughout the text and even in this paragraph but then we refrain from an agreement to take the relevant action in order to act in line with what the science says we have to do.\" Rasmussen received a standing ovation for her call for change. Current Issue View our current issue The Global Stocktake does reference some of what the science calls for, or, as the UNFCCC closing statement spelled out: \"The stocktake recognizes the science that indicates global greenhouse gas emissions need to be cut 43% by 2030, compared to 2019 levels, to limit global warming to 1.5°C.\" So this is the decade when emissions needs to be radically reduced. But the COP 28 outcome did not outline enough action steps to account for necessary emissions cuts. As Rasmussen put it, \"It is not enough for us to reference the science and then make agreements that ignore what the science is telling us we need to do. This is not an approach that we should be asked to defend.\" As a result, some referred to the GST as a \"get out of jail free\" card. The annual UN climate negotiations are, of course, not legally binding. But they send strong signals for what actions national governments should take, what policies they should implement, to ensure reductions in emissions and to avert a worsening of the climate crisis. G oing into this year's COP 28, many activists and attendees raised concerns about the role of the fossil fuel lobby. The UAE, the host country, is an OPEC member and among the world's 10 largest oil producers. And COP 28 President Sultan Al Jaber is chief executive of Adnoc, the UAE's state oil company. Then, in the week leading up to COP 28, leaked documents obtained and published by the Centre for Climate Reporting and first reported by the BBC revealed that the UAE planned to promote and expand oil deals with 15 nations during and via COP 28. Adding fuel to fire, the largest number of fossil fuel lobbyists in the history of the UN climate negotiations was in attendance this year. COP 28 was the largest UN climate conference ever, with over 100,000 people registered, of which 70,000 attended. According to an analysis from Kick Big Polluters Out, at least 2,456 fossil fuel lobbyists attended this year's COP 28. That number is more than the number of most nation's number of lobbyists. \"Fossil fuel lobbyists,\" Kick Big Polluters Out point out, \"are only outnumbered by the 3,081 people brought by Brazil (which is expected to host COP30), and the UAE, which as COP28 host brought 4,409 people.\" In fact, the number of fossil fuel lobbyists dwarfs the number of the 10 most climate vulnerable nations, Kick Out Big Polluters argues, which total 1,509, highlighting how industry interests are outnumbering the voices of frontline communities. And the impacts of the fossil fuel industry and fossil fuel producing nations and host on COP 28's outcome were clear. The Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty ⎯whose signatories includes 12 mostly low-lying island nations, the European Parliament, the World Health Organization, and hundreds of elected officials, as well as almost 100 cities and subnational governments⎯has called for a fossil fuel phase-out and a just and equitable transition to renewable energy. But a \"phase-out of fossil fuels,\" for which nations in the Global South were pushing, lobbying, negotiating and protesting, is not mentioned in the final Global Stocktake. Unlike the language that was adopted, that would have sounded a death knell for the fossil fuel industry. There were other important advances, including that COP 28 called for a tripling of renewable energy globally by 2030. As Simon Stiell, executive secretary of the UNFCCC put it: \"COP28 delivered some genuine strides forward. Tripling renewables and doubling energy efficiency.\" But only \"a phase-down of unabated coal power\" was included in the final agreement coming out of COP 28. Already at COP 26 in Glasgow two years ago, negotiators agreed to the inclusion of this very phrase. The word unabated is important. A call for the \"phase-down of unabated coal power\" leaves the door open for the use of abated coal power or fossil fuels. What does abated coal power mean? Abated refers to the use of carbon, capture and storage (CCS) or its storage underground. The technique is expensive, unproven, and cannot easily (affordably) be scaled up as quickly as is needed to avert a climate catastrophe. And, most importantly, since CCS does not exist yet at the scale needed to mitigate, this language leaves the door open to continued fossil fuel usage, while the science, as mentioned above, demands emissions peak by 2025 and that they are reduced by 43 percent by 2030. The surest way to reach that goal is to reduce (not increase) the use of fossil fuels. Another limitation of the final agreement is that it \"recognizes that transitional fuels can play a role in facilitating the energy transition.\" \"Transitional fuels\" are typically viewed as a reference to gas, which is of course a fossil fuel that, in addition to coal, needs to be phased out. Jean Su, acting co-executive director of the Center for Biological Diversity, said the Global Stocktake \"contains major industry escape hatches for disastrous gas expansion...and dangerous climate scams like carbon capture and storage.\" I n the first 24 hours after COP 28 ended, headlines announced positive news for fossil fuel expansion: Barron's reported that \"OPEC sees healthy growth for oil demand in 2024\"; Reuters reported that the International Energy Agency (IEA) said \"world oil demand will rise faster than expected next year\"; Germany sought approval for an liquified natural gas project; the British-French oil and gas company Perenco discovered \"more gas at Ravenspurn South Field in the North Sea\"; \" Norway oil and gas investments are set to soar in 2024\"; \"Petrobras, Shell and Chevron bet big on Brazil,\" winning exploration rights in the deep-water portion of the Pelotas basin off the coast of Brazil in the South Atlantic; \" Shell assumed 100 perecent working interest in Gulf of Mexico Kaikias Field; and in Nigeria \"the largest refinery in the world started producing.\" Apparently, fossil fuel producers and nations who depend on them do not worry that COP 28 is disrupting business as usual, perhaps even quite the contrary: Party like it's 1999! Finally, without adequte funding, the energy transition will fail. And here the results from COP 28 were bleak. COP 27 made major strides on funding, with member nations agreeing to fund a \"loss and damages\" program that would compensate nations already dealing with the climate crisis. It has been \"operationalized,\" but details about it still need to be worked out. How will the fund be structured? How will the contributions work and be dispersed? What amounts? There was little progress on moving funds from the Global North to the Global South for mitigation and adaptation efforts or to compensate for loss and damages. \"We hoped this COP would bring international governments to the same building site, and for wealthy nations like Australia, Canada, the EU, the UK and the US to pay their fair share and support the most vulnerable countries to transition to a 100 percent renewable future,\" said May Boeve, executive director of 350.org. But the Global North is unwilling to take responsibility for its historic emissions and for their impacts and unwilling to allocate the necessary funds for the energy transition. Roman Ioualalen, of Oil Change International, added, \"Rich countries must pay their fair share to enable the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy in the Global South.\" It was not to be. Instead, developed nations managed to continue to shirk their responsibility for creating the climate crisis and for helping frontline communities addressing its impacts. The lacking finance detailed in the document and lacking contributions made at COP 24 means it will become a focus of the discussion in 2024. Again. Given the inadequate contributions from the Global North and no mention of a phase-out of fossil fuels, much-needed this decade, many envoys and activists were nonplussed by the \"historic\" results of COP 28. Meena Raman, with Third World Network in Malaysia, said, \"Developed countries basically got everything they wanted without giving up much. There is no equity here.\" As a result, the focus at COP 29 will be on securing a fossil fuel phase-out and funding from the Global North to help the Global South's energy transition to renewables and to address climate change effects. In the meantime, whether or not the Global Stocktake has impacts depends on each of us and what we push our home nations to do.\n\nThis year's UN climate negotiations called on nations, for the first time ever, to transition \"away from fossil fuels in energy systems .\" After nearly three decades of climate conferences, member states have finally named the culprit of the climate crisis-fossil fuels-and committed to a transition away from them. \"For the first time in three decades of climate negotiations the words fossil fuels have made it into a COP outcome,\" said Mohamed Adow, of Power Shift Africa. \"The genie is never going back into the bottle and future COPs will only turn the screws even more on dirty energy.\" UN Secretary General António Guterres said , \"Whether you like it or not, [a] fossil fuel phase out is inevitable.

As Simon Stiell, executive secretary of the UNFCCC put it: \"COP28 delivered some genuine strides forward. Tripling renewables and doubling energy efficiency.\" But only \"a phase-down of unabated coal power\" was included in the final agreement coming out of COP 28. Already at COP 26 in Glasgow two years ago, negotiators agreed to the inclusion of this very phrase. The word unabated is important. A call for the \"phase-down of unabated coal power\" leaves the door open for the use of abated coal power or fossil fuels. What does abated coal power mean? Abated refers to the use of carbon, capture and storage (CCS) or its storage underground. The technique is expensive, unproven, and cannot easily (affordably) be scaled up as quickly as is needed to avert a climate catastrophe. And, most importantly, since CCS does not exist yet at the scale needed to mitigate, this language leaves the door open to continued fossil fuel usage, while the science, as mentioned above, demands emissions peak by 2025 and that they are reduced by 43 percent by 2030. The surest way to reach that goal is to reduce (not increase) the use of fossil fuels. Another limitation of the final agreement is that it \"recognizes that transitional fuels can play a role in facilitating the energy transition.\" \"Transitional fuels\" are typically viewed as a reference to gas, which is of course a fossil fuel that, in addition to coal, needs to be phased out. Jean Su, acting co-executive director of the Center for Biological Diversity, said the Global Stocktake \"contains major industry escape hatches for disastrous gas expansion...and dangerous climate scams like carbon capture and storage.\" I n the first 24 hours after COP 28 ended, headlines announced positive news for fossil fuel expansion: Barron's reported that \"OPEC sees healthy growth for oil demand in 2024\"; Reuters reported that the International Energy Agency (IEA) said \"world oil demand will rise faster than expected next year\"; Germany sought approval for an liquified natural gas project; the British-French oil and gas company Perenco discovered \"more gas at Ravenspurn South Field in the North Sea\"; \" Norway oil and gas investments are set to soar in 2024\"; \"Petrobras, Shell and Chevron bet big on Brazil,\" winning exploration rights in the deep-water portion of the Pelotas basin off the coast of Brazil in the South Atlantic; \" Shell assumed 100 perecent working interest in Gulf of Mexico Kaikias Field; and in Nigeria \"the largest refinery in the world started producing.\" Apparently, fossil fuel producers and nations who depend on them do not worry that COP 28 is disrupting business as usual, perhaps even quite the contrary: Party like it's 1999! Finally, without adequte funding, the energy transition will fail. And here the results from COP 28 were bleak. COP 27 made major strides on funding, with member nations agreeing to fund a \"loss and damages\" program that would compensate nations already dealing with the climate crisis. It has been \"operationalized,\" but details about it still need to be worked out. How will the fund be structured? How will the contributions work and be dispersed? What amounts? There was little progress on moving funds from the Global North to the Global South for mitigation and adaptation efforts or to compensate for loss and damages. \"We hoped this COP would bring international governments to the same building site, and for wealthy nations like Australia, Canada, the EU, the UK and the US to pay their fair share and support the most vulnerable countries to transition to a 100 percent renewable future,\" said May Boeve, executive director of 350.org. But the Global North is unwilling to take responsibility for its historic emissions and for their impacts and unwilling to allocate the necessary funds for the energy transition. Roman Ioualalen, of Oil Change International, added, \"Rich countries must pay their fair share to enable the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy in the Global South.\" It was not to be. Instead, developed nations managed to continue to shirk their responsibility for creating the climate crisis and for helping frontline communities addressing its impacts. The lacking finance detailed in the document and lacking contributions made at COP 24 means it will become a focus of the discussion in 2024. Again. Given the inadequate contributions from the Global North and no mention of a phase-out of fossil fuels, much-needed this decade, many envoys and activists were nonplussed by the \"historic\" results of COP 28. Meena Raman, with Third World Network in Malaysia, said, \"Developed countries basically got everything they wanted without giving up much. There is no equity here.\" As a result, the focus at COP 29 will be on securing a fossil fuel phase-out and funding from the Global North to help the Global South's energy transition to renewables and to address climate change effects. In the meantime, whether or not the Global Stocktake has impacts depends on each of us and what we push our home nations to do.\n\nThis mention of fossil fuels marks a significant turn from previous years' conferences, when the attempt to include fossil fuels was thwarted. And this year, too, there was stiff opposition to naming fossil fuels. Saudi Arabia was adamant about keeping the focus on emissions rather than the source of them. Early in the negotiations, OPEC Secretary General Haitham Al Ghais sent a letter to OPE's 13 members and the 10 Russian-led allies urging them to reject inclusion of language that mentioned fossil fuels rather than emissions. So in this sense, its inclusion marks a victory.

Anne Rasmussen, chair of the Alliance of Small Islands States (AOSIS), pointed out that 39 small-island developing states (SIDS) were not even in the room when the document coming out of COP 28, called the \"Global Stocktake\" (GST), was approved by President Al Jaber. Low-lying island nations are frontline communities who are intensely at risk, are already experiencing the impacts of the climate crisis, have contributed the least to it in terms of emissions and have been most vocal about insisting on preserving policies and actions are taken to ensure that the UN negotiations keep global warming from exceeding 1.5 Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). The 1.5 limit was enshrined in the 2015 Paris Agreement and has since been the guiding or North Star for the talks and action. \"1.5 to Stay Alive!,\" as Tony de Brum, the late Climate Envoy of the Republic of the Marshall Islands put it, is the mantra of low-lying island nations. That said, according to NASA , the average global temperature has already increased by 1.11o C since 1880, with most of the increase since 1975. And we are currently on a path to 3.3o C according to a 2023 UNEP report , unless we drastically reduce the use of fossil fuels.

We reference the science throughout the text and even in this paragraph but then we refrain from an agreement to take the relevant action in order to act in line with what the science says we have to do.\" Rasmussen received a standing ovation for her call for change. Current Issue View our current issue The Global Stocktake does reference some of what the science calls for, or, as the UNFCCC closing statement spelled out: \"The stocktake recognizes the science that indicates global greenhouse gas emissions need to be cut 43% by 2030, compared to 2019 levels, to limit global warming to 1.5°C.\" So this is the decade when emissions needs to be radically reduced. But the COP 28 outcome did not outline enough action steps to account for necessary emissions cuts. As Rasmussen put it, \"It is not enough for us to reference the science and then make agreements that ignore what the science is telling us we need to do. This is not an approach that we should be asked to defend.\" As a result, some referred to the GST as a \"get out of jail free\" card. The annual UN climate negotiations are, of course, not legally binding. But they send strong signals for what actions national governments should take, what policies they should implement, to ensure reductions in emissions and to avert a worsening of the climate crisis. G oing into this year's COP 28, many activists and attendees raised concerns about the role of the fossil fuel lobby. The UAE, the host country, is an OPEC member and among the world's 10 largest oil producers. And COP 28 President Sultan Al Jaber is chief executive of Adnoc, the UAE's state oil company. Then, in the week leading up to COP 28, leaked documents obtained and published by the Centre for Climate Reporting and first reported by the BBC revealed that the UAE planned to promote and expand oil deals with 15 nations during and via COP 28. Adding fuel to fire, the largest number of fossil fuel lobbyists in the history of the UN climate negotiations was in attendance this year. COP 28 was the largest UN climate conference ever, with over 100,000 people registered, of which 70,000 attended. According to an analysis from Kick Big Polluters Out, at least 2,456 fossil fuel lobbyists attended this year's COP 28. That number is more than the number of most nation's number of lobbyists. \"Fossil fuel lobbyists,\" Kick Big Polluters Out point out, \"are only outnumbered by the 3,081 people brought by Brazil (which is expected to host COP30), and the UAE, which as COP28 host brought 4,409 people.\" In fact, the number of fossil fuel lobbyists dwarfs the number of the 10 most climate vulnerable nations, Kick Out Big Polluters argues, which total 1,509, highlighting how industry interests are outnumbering the voices of frontline communities. And the impacts of the fossil fuel industry and fossil fuel producing nations and host on COP 28's outcome were clear. The Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty ⎯whose signatories includes 12 mostly low-lying island nations, the European Parliament, the World Health Organization, and hundreds of elected officials, as well as almost 100 cities and subnational governments⎯has called for a fossil fuel phase-out and a just and equitable transition to renewable energy. But a \"phase-out of fossil fuels,\" for which nations in the Global South were pushing, lobbying, negotiating and protesting, is not mentioned in the final Global Stocktake. Unlike the language that was adopted, that would have sounded a death knell for the fossil fuel industry. There were other important advances, including that COP 28 called for a tripling of renewable energy globally by 2030.

There were other important advances, including that COP 28 called for a tripling of renewable energy globally by 2030. As Simon Stiell, executive secretary of the UNFCCC put it: \"COP28 delivered some genuine strides forward. Tripling renewables and doubling energy efficiency.\" But only \"a phase-down of unabated coal power\" was included in the final agreement coming out of COP 28. Already at COP 26 in Glasgow two years ago, negotiators agreed to the inclusion of this very phrase. The word unabated is important. A call for the \"phase-down of unabated coal power\" leaves the door open for the use of abated coal power or fossil fuels. What does abated coal power mean? Abated refers to the use of carbon, capture and storage (CCS) or its storage underground. The technique is expensive, unproven, and cannot easily (affordably) be scaled up as quickly as is needed to avert a climate catastrophe. And, most importantly, since CCS does not exist yet at the scale needed to mitigate, this language leaves the door open to continued fossil fuel usage, while the science, as mentioned above, demands emissions peak by 2025 and that they are reduced by 43 percent by 2030. The surest way to reach that goal is to reduce (not increase) the use of fossil fuels. Another limitation of the final agreement is that it \"recognizes that transitional fuels can play a role in facilitating the energy transition.\" \"Transitional fuels\" are typically viewed as a reference to gas, which is of course a fossil fuel that, in addition to coal, needs to be phased out. Jean Su, acting co-executive director of the Center for Biological Diversity, said the Global Stocktake \"contains major industry escape hatches for disastrous gas expansion...and dangerous climate scams like carbon capture and storage.\" I n the first 24 hours after COP 28 ended, headlines announced positive news for fossil fuel expansion: Barron's reported that \"OPEC sees healthy growth for oil demand in 2024\"; Reuters reported that the International Energy Agency (IEA) said \"world oil demand will rise faster than expected next year\"; Germany sought approval for an liquified natural gas project; the British-French oil and gas company Perenco discovered \"more gas at Ravenspurn South Field in the North Sea\"; \" Norway oil and gas investments are set to soar in 2024\"; \"Petrobras, Shell and Chevron bet big on Brazil,\" winning exploration rights in the deep-water portion of the Pelotas basin off the coast of Brazil in the South Atlantic; \" Shell assumed 100 perecent working interest in Gulf of Mexico Kaikias Field; and in Nigeria \"the largest refinery in the world started producing.\" Apparently, fossil fuel producers and nations who depend on them do not worry that COP 28 is disrupting business as usual, perhaps even quite the contrary: Party like it's 1999! Finally, without adequte funding, the energy transition will fail. And here the results from COP 28 were bleak. COP 27 made major strides on funding, with member nations agreeing to fund a \"loss and damages\" program that would compensate nations already dealing with the climate crisis. It has been \"operationalized,\" but details about it still need to be worked out. How will the fund be structured? How will the contributions work and be dispersed? What amounts? There was little progress on moving funds from the Global North to the Global South for mitigation and adaptation efforts or to compensate for loss and damages. \"We hoped this COP would bring international governments to the same building site, and for wealthy nations like Australia, Canada, the EU, the UK and the US to pay their fair share and support the most vulnerable countries to transition to a 100 percent renewable future,\" said May Boeve, executive director of 350.org. But the Global North is unwilling to take responsibility for its historic emissions and for their impacts and unwilling to allocate the necessary funds for the energy transition. Roman Ioualalen, of Oil Change International, added, \"Rich countries must pay their fair share to enable the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy in the Global South.\" It was not to be. Instead, developed nations managed to continue to shirk their responsibility for creating the climate crisis and for helping frontline communities addressing its impacts. The lacking finance detailed in the document and lacking contributions made at COP 24 means it will become a focus of the discussion in 2024. Again. Given the inadequate contributions from the Global North and no mention of a phase-out of fossil fuels, much-needed this decade, many envoys and activists were nonplussed by the \"historic\" results of COP 28. Meena Raman, with Third World Network in Malaysia, said, \"Developed countries basically got everything they wanted without giving up much. There is no equity here.\" As a result, the focus at COP 29 will be on securing a fossil fuel phase-out and funding from the Global North to help the Global South's energy transition to renewables and to address climate change effects. In the meantime, whether or not the Global Stocktake has impacts depends on each of us and what we push our home nations to do.\n\nElie Mystal\n\nFeature / Vincent Bevins\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nElie Mystal\n\nFeature / Vincent Bevins\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nRasmussen called attention to the fact that, in order to avert irreversible climate collapse, emissions must peak by 2025-but that the COP 28 text did not mention this fact. \"Mr. President,\" she said, \"we do not see any commitment or even an invitation for Parties to peak emissions by 2025. We reference the science throughout the text and even in this paragraph but then we refrain from an agreement to take the relevant action in order to act in line with what the science says we have to do.\" Rasmussen received a standing ovation for her call for change. Current Issue View our current issue The Global Stocktake does reference some of what the science calls for, or, as the UNFCCC closing statement spelled out: \"The stocktake recognizes the science that indicates global greenhouse gas emissions need to be cut 43% by 2030, compared to 2019 levels, to limit global warming to 1.5°C.\" So this is the decade when emissions needs to be radically reduced. But the COP 28 outcome did not outline enough action steps to account for necessary emissions cuts. As Rasmussen put it, \"It is not enough for us to reference the science and then make agreements that ignore what the science is telling us we need to do. This is not an approach that we should be asked to defend.\" As a result, some referred to the GST as a \"get out of jail free\" card. The annual UN climate negotiations are, of course, not legally binding. But they send strong signals for what actions national governments should take, what policies they should implement, to ensure reductions in emissions and to avert a worsening of the climate crisis. G oing into this year's COP 28, many activists and attendees raised concerns about the role of the fossil fuel lobby. The UAE, the host country, is an OPEC member and among the world's 10 largest oil producers. And COP 28 President Sultan Al Jaber is chief executive of Adnoc, the UAE's state oil company. Then, in the week leading up to COP 28, leaked documents obtained and published by the Centre for Climate Reporting and first reported by the BBC revealed that the UAE planned to promote and expand oil deals with 15 nations during and via COP 28. Adding fuel to fire, the largest number of fossil fuel lobbyists in the history of the UN climate negotiations was in attendance this year. COP 28 was the largest UN climate conference ever, with over 100,000 people registered, of which 70,000 attended. According to an analysis from Kick Big Polluters Out, at least 2,456 fossil fuel lobbyists attended this year's COP 28. That number is more than the number of most nation's number of lobbyists. \"Fossil fuel lobbyists,\" Kick Big Polluters Out point out, \"are only outnumbered by the 3,081 people brought by Brazil (which is expected to host COP30), and the UAE, which as COP28 host brought 4,409 people.\" In fact, the number of fossil fuel lobbyists dwarfs the number of the 10 most climate vulnerable nations, Kick Out Big Polluters argues, which total 1,509, highlighting how industry interests are outnumbering the voices of frontline communities. And the impacts of the fossil fuel industry and fossil fuel producing nations and host on COP 28's outcome were clear. The Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty ⎯whose signatories includes 12 mostly low-lying island nations, the European Parliament, the World Health Organization, and hundreds of elected officials, as well as almost 100 cities and subnational governments⎯has called for a fossil fuel phase-out and a just and equitable transition to renewable energy.

Finally, without adequte funding, the energy transition will fail. And here the results from COP 28 were bleak. COP 27 made major strides on funding, with member nations agreeing to fund a \"loss and damages\" program that would compensate nations already dealing with the climate crisis. It has been \"operationalized,\" but details about it still need to be worked out. How will the fund be structured? How will the contributions work and be dispersed? What amounts? There was little progress on moving funds from the Global North to the Global South for mitigation and adaptation efforts or to compensate for loss and damages. \"We hoped this COP would bring international governments to the same building site, and for wealthy nations like Australia, Canada, the EU, the UK and the US to pay their fair share and support the most vulnerable countries to transition to a 100 percent renewable future,\" said May Boeve, executive director of 350.org. But the Global North is unwilling to take responsibility for its historic emissions and for their impacts and unwilling to allocate the necessary funds for the energy transition. Roman Ioualalen, of Oil Change International, added, \"Rich countries must pay their fair share to enable the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy in the Global South.\" It was not to be. Instead, developed nations managed to continue to shirk their responsibility for creating the climate crisis and for helping frontline communities addressing its impacts. The lacking finance detailed in the document and lacking contributions made at COP 24 means it will become a focus of the discussion in 2024. Again. Given the inadequate contributions from the Global North and no mention of a phase-out of fossil fuels, much-needed this decade, many envoys and activists were nonplussed by the \"historic\" results of COP 28. Meena Raman, with Third World Network in Malaysia, said, \"Developed countries basically got everything they wanted without giving up much. There is no equity here.\" As a result, the focus at COP 29 will be on securing a fossil fuel phase-out and funding from the Global North to help the Global South's energy transition to renewables and to address climate change effects. In the meantime, whether or not the Global Stocktake has impacts depends on each of us and what we push our home nations to do.\n\nAdding fuel to fire, the largest number of fossil fuel lobbyists in the history of the UN climate negotiations was in attendance this year. COP 28 was the largest UN climate conference ever, with over 100,000 people registered, of which 70,000 attended. According to an analysis from Kick Big Polluters Out, at least 2,456 fossil fuel lobbyists attended this year's COP 28. That number is more than the number of most nation's number of lobbyists. \"Fossil fuel lobbyists,\" Kick Big Polluters Out point out, \"are only outnumbered by the 3,081 people brought by Brazil (which is expected to host COP30), and the UAE, which as COP28 host brought 4,409 people.\" In fact, the number of fossil fuel lobbyists dwarfs the number of the 10 most climate vulnerable nations, Kick Out Big Polluters argues, which total 1,509, highlighting how industry interests are outnumbering the voices of frontline communities. And the impacts of the fossil fuel industry and fossil fuel producing nations and host on COP 28's outcome were clear. The Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty ⎯whose signatories includes 12 mostly low-lying island nations, the European Parliament, the World Health Organization, and hundreds of elected officials, as well as almost 100 cities and subnational governments⎯has called for a fossil fuel phase-out and a just and equitable transition to renewable energy. But a \"phase-out of fossil fuels,\" for which nations in the Global South were pushing, lobbying, negotiating and protesting, is not mentioned in the final Global Stocktake. Unlike the language that was adopted, that would have sounded a death knell for the fossil fuel industry. There were other important advances, including that COP 28 called for a tripling of renewable energy globally by 2030. As Simon Stiell, executive secretary of the UNFCCC put it: \"COP28 delivered some genuine strides forward. Tripling renewables and doubling energy efficiency.\" But only \"a phase-down of unabated coal power\" was included in the final agreement coming out of COP 28. Already at COP 26 in Glasgow two years ago, negotiators agreed to the inclusion of this very phrase. The word unabated is important. A call for the \"phase-down of unabated coal power\" leaves the door open for the use of abated coal power or fossil fuels. What does abated coal power mean? Abated refers to the use of carbon, capture and storage (CCS) or its storage underground. The technique is expensive, unproven, and cannot easily (affordably) be scaled up as quickly as is needed to avert a climate catastrophe. And, most importantly, since CCS does not exist yet at the scale needed to mitigate, this language leaves the door open to continued fossil fuel usage, while the science, as mentioned above, demands emissions peak by 2025 and that they are reduced by 43 percent by 2030. The surest way to reach that goal is to reduce (not increase) the use of fossil fuels. Another limitation of the final agreement is that it \"recognizes that transitional fuels can play a role in facilitating the energy transition.\" \"Transitional fuels\" are typically viewed as a reference to gas, which is of course a fossil fuel that, in addition to coal, needs to be phased out. Jean Su, acting co-executive director of the Center for Biological Diversity, said the Global Stocktake \"contains major industry escape hatches for disastrous gas expansion...and dangerous climate scams like carbon capture and storage.\" I n the first 24 hours after COP 28 ended, headlines announced positive news for fossil fuel expansion: Barron's reported that \"OPEC sees healthy growth for oil demand in 2024\"; Reuters reported that the International Energy Agency (IEA) said \"world oil demand will rise faster than expected next year\"; Germany sought approval for an liquified natural gas project; the British-French oil and gas company Perenco discovered \"more gas at Ravenspurn South Field in the North Sea\"; \" Norway oil and gas investments are set to soar in 2024\"; \"Petrobras, Shell and Chevron bet big on Brazil,\" winning exploration rights in the deep-water portion of the Pelotas basin off the coast of Brazil in the South Atlantic; \" Shell assumed 100 perecent working interest in Gulf of Mexico Kaikias Field; and in Nigeria \"the largest refinery in the world started producing.\" Apparently, fossil fuel producers and nations who depend on them do not worry that COP 28 is disrupting business as usual, perhaps even quite the contrary: Party like it's 1999!

Given the inadequate contributions from the Global North and no mention of a phase-out of fossil fuels, much-needed this decade, many envoys and activists were nonplussed by the \"historic\" results of COP 28. Meena Raman, with Third World Network in Malaysia, said, \"Developed countries basically got everything they wanted without giving up much. There is no equity here.\" As a result, the focus at COP 29 will be on securing a fossil fuel phase-out and funding from the Global North to help the Global South's energy transition to renewables and to address climate change effects. In the meantime, whether or not the Global Stocktake has impacts depends on each of us and what we push our home nations to do.\n\nGiven the inadequate contributions from the Global North and no mention of a phase-out of fossil fuels, much-needed this decade, many envoys and activists were nonplussed by the \"historic\" results of COP 28.

Sixty-one people have been indicted in Georgia on racketeering charges for their roles in protesting a proposed police and training facility in the Atlanta area known as \"Cop City.\"\n\nWhat started out as a local fight over a $90 million, 85-acre militarized police base in the Weelaunee Forest near Atlanta, known as \"Cop City,\" has turned into one of the most extreme cases of government overreach, oppression, and violence in recent years. City and state officials are covering up the police killing of a protester and waging a chilling assault on the right to protest that risks setting a dangerous precedent.\n\nIn January, heavily militarized Georgia State Patrol officers shot and killed Manuel \"Tortuguita\" Terán, a nonviolent activist protesting in the local forest that Cop City would destroy, in a hail of 57 bullets. In the immediate aftermath of their killing, law enforcement claimed that Tortuguita possessed a firearm and fired first. This was a lie. Body camera footage suggests one officer shot another, and autopsies showed Tortuguita had their arms raised and no gunpowder residue on their hands when they were killed.\n\nRather than investigate Tortuguita's killing or reassess their approach to opponents of Cop City, law enforcement has continued to detain dozens of protesters. They have relied on baseless evidence and minor offenses like trespassing to charge more than 40 demonstrators with domestic terrorism. In a further attempt to criminalize the right to protest, a heavily armed team of Atlanta Police Department SWAT and Georgia Bureau of Investigation officers violently arrested three community activists for raising bail money and helping to find attorneys for the arrested protesters. Last week, Georgia's Republican attorney general doubled down on his politically motivated prosecution of protesters, charging 61 people with state RICO charges, sending a clear message that dissent will be punished, which was a step too far even for the DeKalb County prosecutor. The indictment reads less like a legal document and more like a MAGA manifesto. It alleges that the date the police killed George Floyd was the start of a \"racketeering enterprise\" instead of a movement for justice.\n\nMany leaders of the civil rights movement used the same tools of nonviolent resistance-they famously ran bail funds . This raises the question: Would the state of Georgia today consider the nonviolent activism of civil rights leaders to be \"terrorism\" and arrest them for exercising their constitutional rights?\n\nOur rights to free speech and assembly and our due process rights to defend ourselves against politically motivated government charges are under attack, and it's not just in Atlanta. In Detroit, police beat and arrested Black Lives Matter protesters; then the City relentlessly prosecuted them. Years and numerous legal defeats later, the City of Detroit is now paying more than $1 million to protesters whose rights were violated. In St. Louis, law enforcement routinely harassed and intimidated activists during the Ferguson uprising.\n\nRegardless of one's politics, every person in our country should be able to advocate for what they believe in, which is why it is crucial that we pay attention to what is happening in Cop City.\n\nWe cannot allow for the suppression of our right to dissent. And while the repression is always intolerable, it bears noting that Cop City is the apex of injustice. Tearing down trees in Black and brown communities at a moment of reckoning with the climate crisis to perpetuate the prison-industrial complex demonstrates an astounding lack of morality, foresight, and care for those living in these neighborhoods. This is racist. One of the forest defenders recently said , \"The intersection between the climate crisis, growing inequality, and the militarization of cops is emblematic here, but it's a problem everywhere.\"\n\nDespite all this, Atlanta's elected officials keep moving Cop City forward. In June, in the middle of the night, and despite hours of nearly unanimous public opposition from many Black and brown residents, the Atlanta City Council approved tens of millions of taxpayer dollars for its development. And now, on top of all of this, public officials are actively blocking a referendum on the facility, raising serious concerns about voter suppression.\n\nWe stand against these dangerous and dystopian efforts to criminalize the protection of the planet, threaten the health and safety of Black and brown communities, and transform political advocacy into \"terrorism\" punished with extreme charges and sentences. We call on the Department of Justice to investigate Tortuguita's killing, its subsequent cover-up, and the deprivation of civil rights through domestic terrorism charges against protesters. It's time to hold those responsible accountable.\n\nWe must transform our approach to public safety and adopt policies and practices that will truly keep our communities safe. Instead of funneling taxpayer dollars into militarized policing and prosecutorial abuse, we must invest that money in the basic needs of our communities and provide universal health care, public housing, universal childcare, strong unions, and livable wages. We all have a right to participate in our democratic process, and that includes the right to nonviolently protest decisions our governments make. This is a critical moment for every person who values freedom from government overreach to stand in solidarity with movements for justice like Stop Cop City. These intensified assaults against activists are about so much more than the message they are intended to send in the moment-they are about silencing the voices of our democracy.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home.

Millions took to the streets around the world, and cops responded with the same violence that was being protested. As Brooks Laughlin watched from a prison cell in Washington state, he was sure he could help the protesters and the police understand each other. He thought he knew from experience exactly what was toxic with police culture and how it could be overcome. In December, I sat with him on the gymnasium floor of the Monroe Correctional Complex. He leaned back against a brick wall-his wide, muscular build a testament to his love of powerlifting. Laughlin always seems tough and collected, and seldom shows any emotion. In 2006, he graduated from Washington state's police academy with top honors, and then at 21, became the Bellingham Police Department's youngest hire in decades. For the next 13 years, he worked as a drug detective; a range master, charged with training and qualifying officers with guns; a member of the National Tactical Officers' Association; and an undercover operative in federal organized crime investigations. He literally wrote the test given to all new officers in his department. He planned and executed drug raids, was involved in shoot-outs, and trained SWAT teams. He was the type of cop about which movies are made. But all the while a secret haunted him that would eventually help land him in prison: \"Since I was young, I knew I had Bipolar Disorder Type I. My mum recognized a lot of it, because growing up her dad was bipolar, and he went to prison and mental institutions for robbing his bank.\" By the time Laughlin was 13, he said he also knew that he would grow up to become a cop. At 14, he joined the Police Explorers, where he got to do ride-alongs and participate in training simulations with the SWAT team. For him, he said, \"there was this picture of law enforcement that was a false picture of perfection.\" His assimilation into police culture started early. \"As an Explorer, I learned there are slangs for everything. Four-eighty-one was the clearing code for someone who was crazy. That was my first glimpse into the dehumanization,\" he told me. \"They didn't call it someone who is having a crisis. No, this is a four-eighty-one. I was like I can't be a four-eighty-one, so I didn't go get a diagnosis.\" Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The Power and Symbolism of Brazil's Landless Workers' Movement The Power and Symbolism of Brazil's Landless Workers' Movement Feature / Vincent Bevins The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The Power and Symbolism of Brazil's Landless Workers' Movement The Power and Symbolism of Brazil's Landless Workers' Movement Feature / Vincent Bevins The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis Current Issue View our current issue At the Academy, he was indoctrinated into an \"us versus the world\" mentality and learned just how deep such dehumanization ran. He said he learned the \"colloquial terms for people you encounter, such as 'doper,' 'skell' [short for skeleton], 'mope,' and 'thug.'\" He said he understands now how they carry \"clear racial undertones,\" but explained that \"it doesn't take long for a recruit to be totally enmeshed into their new cop identity.\" As a young officer, he embraced police culture, which he now describes as cult-like. He married a girl with whom he had been an Explorer and whose father was on the force. They bought a home in suburbia, and had their first child when he was 26. To onlookers, he was a poster child for the aforementioned picture of police perfection, but at work, very different images were being seared into his memory. \"I responded to dead bodies, ranging from suicides, drug overdoses, car accidents, to natural causes. I was in a shoot-out before my training was even over. Less than a month off, I was the first on the scene of a drug homicide, where I had to hold someone's brains in with a towel. He didn't make it. That was just the tip of the iceberg of the horrors I would see and experience over the next dozen years.\" He told me that witnessing the carnage and suffering-often the result of the War on Drugs-drove even the most callous of cops into self-imposed isolation: \"It becomes hard to relate to outsiders. The only people you can relate to are those in your tribe. Your identity becomes fused to that of a cop. This extreme tribalism is the root of toxic police culture. Those that don't face the isolation are ostracized and usually don't make probationary officer status.\" Related Article Incarcerated, Infected, and Ignored: Inside an Arkansas Prison Outbreak Molly Minta The hiring practices, he explained, also play a role. The typical recruit is a white male in his mid-20s with at least some college education. Combine this with a screening for mental illness and a criminal background, and you end up with officers without the experiences of hardship that can help them relate to those they meet in the field. Before long, the Laughlins brought another child into the world. During the birth, Brook Laughlin's mother was rushed to a hospital in Seattle for an emergency operation related to a softball-sized tumor in her brain. \"I couldn't be there because my daughter was being born. It triggered me being manic, because everything was about me or my mum. That's when I stopped giving a shit,\" he said. She survived the surgery and got to meet her second granddaughter, but missed the birth of her third by two weeks. In 2015, Laughlin received a call on his birthday from his father telling him he needed to go see his mum. In February, he lost the person who had kept him grounded since he was a child. Within months, Laughlin's marriage unraveled. He began drinking heavily and soon eloped with a woman from the force with whom he'd been having an affair. Fully immersed in a macho workplace, he ignored his declining mental health and normalized his own violent behavior. In 2018, Laughlin was arrested for second degree assault/domestic violence against his wife and sentenced to 96 months in prison. He told me, \"What I did to my ex-wife is inexcusable... The fact is I hurt the person, other than my kids, I loved the most.\" He said being in prison challenged everything he had been trained to believe about the criminal justice system. \"During my trial, they said I had attended something like 3,800 hours of training, not including the ones I spent teaching. The thing that struck me was that in all those hundreds of hours, none of it told me anything about what life in prison and convict culture is really like. I had no idea what psychosocial factors from prison led to behaviors on the streets.\" Laughlin said that it was the people he met in county jail and prison that led to his realization about the police: \"It was people that led me to see and understand that mass incarceration and aggressive policing is doing no good for this country. We are systemically setting up generations of disenfranchised people for state-sponsored slavery.\" In an era where the idea of police reform has become popular, Laughlin said he feels a responsibility to use his experience on both sides of the system to offer practical solutions: \"Our nation's drug strategies have done a lot to shape modern policing. Drug enforcement is mostly done where it's most visible: the urban street level in poor communities, primarily of color. Drug arrests are easy to self-initiate, which makes them very appealing for cops wishing to generate stats. I believe shifting the drug strategy away from a law enforcement issue to a public health one would improve police's relationships with the communities they serve. Mental health also needs to be handled differently. Not only does law enforcement need to change how they view mental health in the community, but also among their own ranks.\" Related Article The Devastating Emotional Toll of Suspending Prison Visits Karina Piser Laughlin is set for release in 2023, and he said he wants to use his expertise to fight for social justice. He spends his days in prison strumming an acoustic guitar and developing a consulting program that will work with police departments to hold meetings with the formerly incarcerated to further what he believes might be the most important conversation in the country. Recognizing the transformative power of getting to know the people he once viewed as enemies, he said he believes that it's crucial for officers to experience these encounters as well. \"I want to use my experience to help bridge gaps with police agencies and those they serve. I have a plan for classes for law enforcement, where I would bring in convicts to help facilitate learning. Not to lecture or share trade secrets by either side, but in collaborative groups, to work towards solutions.\" He also pointed out that police performance is typically measured in arrests, tickets, warrants, and other enforcement means. \"Reviews and statistics for arrests are used when officers try out for special units and promotions,\" he told me. \"There's no measure of 'What good did you do in people's lives?' Drug crimes, which are predominantly enforced in communities of color, are the easiest target for a stat-hungry officer. The way we allow agencies to use enforcement statistics as a metric of performance is, in itself a testament to systemic racism within the force, and needs to be eliminated.\" Lastly, he said his time as a convict has changed his views about outside oversight. The Department of Corrections, much like the police force, handles all complaints in-house. He said that this means they're likely handled by friends of those in power and thrown out, which provides police and prison guards with almost complete impunity. Laughlin knows the underlying system needs to be changed, but he urged individual officers to not lose themselves in the uniform, and wanted to make a plea to every cop reading this: \"Ignore the stigma our police culture has created about mental health. The most manly thing you can do is ask for help. If your anger is getting out of control, your work life is perfect, but marriage is a mess, or you think of harming yourself, deal with it now, so you don't end up as the next cop making headlines.\"\n\nGeorge Floyd uttered the phrase with the simple hope that the police officer kneeling on his neck would let him live, but the words resonated through communities that understood what it meant to be suffocated by those entrusted to protect them.

In 2006, he graduated from Washington state's police academy with top honors, and then at 21, became the Bellingham Police Department's youngest hire in decades. For the next 13 years, he worked as a drug detective; a range master, charged with training and qualifying officers with guns; a member of the National Tactical Officers' Association; and an undercover operative in federal organized crime investigations. He literally wrote the test given to all new officers in his department. He planned and executed drug raids, was involved in shoot-outs, and trained SWAT teams. He was the type of cop about which movies are made. But all the while a secret haunted him that would eventually help land him in prison: \"Since I was young, I knew I had Bipolar Disorder Type I. My mum recognized a lot of it, because growing up her dad was bipolar, and he went to prison and mental institutions for robbing his bank.\" By the time Laughlin was 13, he said he also knew that he would grow up to become a cop. At 14, he joined the Police Explorers, where he got to do ride-alongs and participate in training simulations with the SWAT team. For him, he said, \"there was this picture of law enforcement that was a false picture of perfection.\" His assimilation into police culture started early. \"As an Explorer, I learned there are slangs for everything. Four-eighty-one was the clearing code for someone who was crazy. That was my first glimpse into the dehumanization,\" he told me. \"They didn't call it someone who is having a crisis.

He married a girl with whom he had been an Explorer and whose father was on the force. They bought a home in suburbia, and had their first child when he was 26. To onlookers, he was a poster child for the aforementioned picture of police perfection, but at work, very different images were being seared into his memory. \"I responded to dead bodies, ranging from suicides, drug overdoses, car accidents, to natural causes.

Before long, the Laughlins brought another child into the world. During the birth, Brook Laughlin's mother was rushed to a hospital in Seattle for an emergency operation related to a softball-sized tumor in her brain. \"I couldn't be there because my daughter was being born. It triggered me being manic, because everything was about me or my mum. That's when I stopped giving a shit,\" he said. She survived the surgery and got to meet her second granddaughter, but missed the birth of her third by two weeks. In 2015, Laughlin received a call on his birthday from his father telling him he needed to go see his mum. In February, he lost the person who had kept him grounded since he was a child. Within months, Laughlin's marriage unraveled. He began drinking heavily and soon eloped with a woman from the force with whom he'd been having an affair. Fully immersed in a macho workplace, he ignored his declining mental health and normalized his own violent behavior. In 2018, Laughlin was arrested for second degree assault/domestic violence against his wife and sentenced to 96 months in prison. He told me, \"What I did to my ex-wife is inexcusable... The fact is I hurt the person, other than my kids, I loved the most.\" He said being in prison challenged everything he had been trained to believe about the criminal justice system. \"During my trial, they said I had attended something like 3,800 hours of training, not including the ones I spent teaching. The thing that struck me was that in all those hundreds of hours, none of it told me anything about what life in prison and convict culture is really like. I had no idea what psychosocial factors from prison led to behaviors on the streets.\" Laughlin said that it was the people he met in county jail and prison that led to his realization about the police: \"It was people that led me to see and understand that mass incarceration and aggressive policing is doing no good for this country. We are systemically setting up generations of disenfranchised people for state-sponsored slavery.\" In an era where the idea of police reform has become popular, Laughlin said he feels a responsibility to use his experience on both sides of the system to offer practical solutions: \"Our nation's drug strategies have done a lot to shape modern policing. Drug enforcement is mostly done where it's most visible: the urban street level in poor communities, primarily of color. Drug arrests are easy to self-initiate, which makes them very appealing for cops wishing to generate stats. I believe shifting the drug strategy away from a law enforcement issue to a public health one would improve police's relationships with the communities they serve. Mental health also needs to be handled differently. Not only does law enforcement need to change how they view mental health in the community, but also among their own ranks.\" Related Article The Devastating Emotional Toll of Suspending Prison Visits Karina Piser Laughlin is set for release in 2023, and he said he wants to use his expertise to fight for social justice. He spends his days in prison strumming an acoustic guitar and developing a consulting program that will work with police departments to hold meetings with the formerly incarcerated to further what he believes might be the most important conversation in the country. Recognizing the transformative power of getting to know the people he once viewed as enemies, he said he believes that it's crucial for officers to experience these encounters as well. \"I want to use my experience to help bridge gaps with police agencies and those they serve. I have a plan for classes for law enforcement, where I would bring in convicts to help facilitate learning. Not to lecture or share trade secrets by either side, but in collaborative groups, to work towards solutions.\" He also pointed out that police performance is typically measured in arrests, tickets, warrants, and other enforcement means. \"Reviews and statistics for arrests are used when officers try out for special units and promotions,\" he told me. \"There's no measure of 'What good did you do in people's lives?' Drug crimes, which are predominantly enforced in communities of color, are the easiest target for a stat-hungry officer. The way we allow agencies to use enforcement statistics as a metric of performance is, in itself a testament to systemic racism within the force, and needs to be eliminated.\" Lastly, he said his time as a convict has changed his views about outside oversight. The Department of Corrections, much like the police force, handles all complaints in-house. He said that this means they're likely handled by friends of those in power and thrown out, which provides police and prison guards with almost complete impunity. Laughlin knows the underlying system needs to be changed, but he urged individual officers to not lose themselves in the uniform, and wanted to make a plea to every cop reading this: \"Ignore the stigma our police culture has created about mental health.

We are systemically setting up generations of disenfranchised people for state-sponsored slavery.\" In an era where the idea of police reform has become popular, Laughlin said he feels a responsibility to use his experience on both sides of the system to offer practical solutions: \"Our nation's drug strategies have done a lot to shape modern policing. Drug enforcement is mostly done where it's most visible: the urban street level in poor communities, primarily of color. Drug arrests are easy to self-initiate, which makes them very appealing for cops wishing to generate stats. I believe shifting the drug strategy away from a law enforcement issue to a public health one would improve police's relationships with the communities they serve. Mental health also needs to be handled differently. Not only does law enforcement need to change how they view mental health in the community, but also among their own ranks.\" Related Article The Devastating Emotional Toll of Suspending Prison Visits Karina Piser Laughlin is set for release in 2023, and he said he wants to use his expertise to fight for social justice. He spends his days in prison strumming an acoustic guitar and developing a consulting program that will work with police departments to hold meetings with the formerly incarcerated to further what he believes might be the most important conversation in the country. Recognizing the transformative power of getting to know the people he once viewed as enemies, he said he believes that it's crucial for officers to experience these encounters as well. \"I want to use my experience to help bridge gaps with police agencies and those they serve. I have a plan for classes for law enforcement, where I would bring in convicts to help facilitate learning. Not to lecture or share trade secrets by either side, but in collaborative groups, to work towards solutions.\" He also pointed out that police performance is typically measured in arrests, tickets, warrants, and other enforcement means. \"Reviews and statistics for arrests are used when officers try out for special units and promotions,\" he told me. \"There's no measure of 'What good did you do in people's lives?' Drug crimes, which are predominantly enforced in communities of color, are the easiest target for a stat-hungry officer. The way we allow agencies to use enforcement statistics as a metric of performance is, in itself a testament to systemic racism within the force, and needs to be eliminated.\" Lastly, he said his time as a convict has changed his views about outside oversight. The Department of Corrections, much like the police force, handles all complaints in-house. He said that this means they're likely handled by friends of those in power and thrown out, which provides police and prison guards with almost complete impunity. Laughlin knows the underlying system needs to be changed, but he urged individual officers to not lose themselves in the uniform, and wanted to make a plea to every cop reading this: \"Ignore the stigma our police culture has created about mental health. The most manly thing you can do is ask for help. If your anger is getting out of control, your work life is perfect, but marriage is a mess, or you think of harming yourself, deal with it now, so you don't end up as the next cop making headlines.\"\n\nHis assimilation into police culture started early. \"As an Explorer, I learned there are slangs for everything. Four-eighty-one was the clearing code for someone who was crazy. That was my first glimpse into the dehumanization,\" he told me. \"They didn't call it someone who is having a crisis. No, this is a four-eighty-one.

He said he learned the \"colloquial terms for people you encounter, such as 'doper,' 'skell' [short for skeleton], 'mope,' and 'thug.'\" He said he understands now how they carry \"clear racial undertones,\" but explained that \"it doesn't take long for a recruit to be totally enmeshed into their new cop identity.\" As a young officer, he embraced police culture, which he now describes as cult-like. He married a girl with whom he had been an Explorer and whose father was on the force. They bought a home in suburbia, and had their first child when he was 26. To onlookers, he was a poster child for the aforementioned picture of police perfection, but at work, very different images were being seared into his memory. \"I responded to dead bodies, ranging from suicides, drug overdoses, car accidents, to natural causes.

That was just the tip of the iceberg of the horrors I would see and experience over the next dozen years.\" He told me that witnessing the carnage and suffering-often the result of the War on Drugs-drove even the most callous of cops into self-imposed isolation: \"It becomes hard to relate to outsiders. The only people you can relate to are those in your tribe. Your identity becomes fused to that of a cop. This extreme tribalism is the root of toxic police culture.

Combine this with a screening for mental illness and a criminal background, and you end up with officers without the experiences of hardship that can help them relate to those they meet in the field. Before long, the Laughlins brought another child into the world. During the birth, Brook Laughlin's mother was rushed to a hospital in Seattle for an emergency operation related to a softball-sized tumor in her brain. \"I couldn't be there because my daughter was being born. It triggered me being manic, because everything was about me or my mum. That's when I stopped giving a shit,\" he said. She survived the surgery and got to meet her second granddaughter, but missed the birth of her third by two weeks. In 2015, Laughlin received a call on his birthday from his father telling him he needed to go see his mum. In February, he lost the person who had kept him grounded since he was a child. Within months, Laughlin's marriage unraveled. He began drinking heavily and soon eloped with a woman from the force with whom he'd been having an affair. Fully immersed in a macho workplace, he ignored his declining mental health and normalized his own violent behavior. In 2018, Laughlin was arrested for second degree assault/domestic violence against his wife and sentenced to 96 months in prison. He told me, \"What I did to my ex-wife is inexcusable... The fact is I hurt the person, other than my kids, I loved the most.\" He said being in prison challenged everything he had been trained to believe about the criminal justice system. \"During my trial, they said I had attended something like 3,800 hours of training, not including the ones I spent teaching.

Recognizing the transformative power of getting to know the people he once viewed as enemies, he said he believes that it's crucial for officers to experience these encounters as well. \"I want to use my experience to help bridge gaps with police agencies and those they serve.

The Department of Corrections, much like the police force, handles all complaints in-house. He said that this means they're likely handled by friends of those in power and thrown out, which provides police and prison guards with almost complete impunity. Laughlin knows the underlying system needs to be changed, but he urged individual officers to not lose themselves in the uniform, and wanted to make a plea to every cop reading this: \"Ignore the stigma our police culture has created about mental health. The most manly thing you can do is ask for help. If your anger is getting out of control, your work life is perfect, but marriage is a mess, or you think of harming yourself, deal with it now, so you don't end up as the next cop making headlines.\"\n\nBefore long, the Laughlins brought another child into the world. During the birth, Brook Laughlin's mother was rushed to a hospital in Seattle for an emergency operation related to a softball-sized tumor in her brain. \"I couldn't be there because my daughter was being born. It triggered me being manic, because everything was about me or my mum. That's when I stopped giving a shit,\" he said. She survived the surgery and got to meet her second granddaughter, but missed the birth of her third by two weeks. In 2015, Laughlin received a call on his birthday from his father telling him he needed to go see his mum. In February, he lost the person who had kept him grounded since he was a child. Within months, Laughlin's marriage unraveled. He began drinking heavily and soon eloped with a woman from the force with whom he'd been having an affair. Fully immersed in a macho workplace, he ignored his declining mental health and normalized his own violent behavior. In 2018, Laughlin was arrested for second degree assault/domestic violence against his wife and sentenced to 96 months in prison. He told me, \"What I did to my ex-wife is inexcusable... The fact is I hurt the person, other than my kids, I loved the most.\" He said being in prison challenged everything he had been trained to believe about the criminal justice system. \"During my trial, they said I had attended something like 3,800 hours of training, not including the ones I spent teaching. The thing that struck me was that in all those hundreds of hours, none of it told me anything about what life in prison and convict culture is really like. I had no idea what psychosocial factors from prison led to behaviors on the streets.\" Laughlin said that it was the people he met in county jail and prison that led to his realization about the police: \"It was people that led me to see and understand that mass incarceration and aggressive policing is doing no good for this country. We are systemically setting up generations of disenfranchised people for state-sponsored slavery.\" In an era where the idea of police reform has become popular, Laughlin said he feels a responsibility to use his experience on both sides of the system to offer practical solutions: \"Our nation's drug strategies have done a lot to shape modern policing. Drug enforcement is mostly done where it's most visible: the urban street level in poor communities, primarily of color. Drug arrests are easy to self-initiate, which makes them very appealing for cops wishing to generate stats. I believe shifting the drug strategy away from a law enforcement issue to a public health one would improve police's relationships with the communities they serve. Mental health also needs to be handled differently.

And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

      "text": "The Cop Was the Hero in One Viral Video. Another Told a Different Story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nBobby White was celebrated as the \"Basketball Cop\" after millions saw a video of him shooting hoops with local teenagers. A recording from two years earlier shows him throwing a young Black man on the hood of his car during an arrest.\n\nBy Nicholas Casey\n\nAahtrell Johnson remembered the police car rolling up, just before he was about to take his shot at the basket under the pine trees. It was 2016, and his neighbor had called 911, complaining that he was getting loud in the street. A white officer named Bobby White had been sent to respond.\n\nAs Mr. White, a Florida native with a trimmed goatee, approached Mr. Johnson, who is Black, the officer could see the 17-year-old was only playing basketball with his friend. Rather than issue a ticket, Mr. Johnson recalled, the officer asked if he could join the game. He shot some hoops with the teenagers, and others came out of their homes.\n\nNo one noticed that Mr. White's dashboard camera was running the whole time.\n\nThe video - posted online by the Police Department afterward and watched by millions of viewers - was a moment of hope in an age where recordings of police brutality were the ones going viral. Mr. White became a celebrity in Gainesville, Fla., and was nicknamed \"Basketball Cop.\" Sports stars came to play pickup games with the Gainesville teens. Mr. White founded a nonprofit to ease relations between the police and Black youths and was invited on NBC's \"Nightly News\" and ESPN to promote it.\n\n\"He didn't look at us like we were criminals,\" Mr. Johnson, now 22, said.\n\nBut Chanae Jackson, a real estate agent who was born in Gainesville, had a different understanding of policing in the city. Her son had a troubling encounter with law enforcement in 2018, and she became a vocal critic of the department. This May, someone sent her another video of Mr. White: A cellphone recording of him slamming a Black teenager into the hood of his patrol car.\n\nAfter the killing of George Floyd, Ms. Jackson decided she would release the video.\n\nAnd with just a click on Facebook, she set off an uproar that stripped away not only Mr. White's image as the face of what good neighborhood policing should be but also the assumption - embraced by liberal-minded reformers in Gainesville and across the country - that fixing racial bias could be as simple as retraining officers and focusing on \"community policing.\"\n\n\"The culture of police departments creates an environment where there are no real consequences for these officers,\" Ms. Jackson wrote in her post under the clip of Mr. White's encounter with the teenager, who was pulled over for running a stop sign on his bicycle.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "'A Cop Movie' Review: When a Uniform Is a Costume\n\nWhat to Watch\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nThis strange and ambitious Mexican film plays like a combination of \"Cops,\" \"F for Fake\" and \"When Harry Met Sally.\"\n\nBy Ben Kenigsberg\n\nWhen you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.\n\nAmbitious, heady and distinctive, if easier to admire in theory than engage with moment to moment, \"A Cop Movie\" has a conceptual strangeness that's difficult to overstate. It's as if someone combined \"Cops,\" \"F for Fake\" and \"When Harry Met Sally.\"\n\nDirected by Alonso Ruizpalacios ( \"Museo\" ), the film, from Mexico, initially appears to be a straight documentary. It opens with a sequence in which Teresa, one of the two main police officers, responds to a call about a woman in labor. After Teresa radios to check on an ambulance that isn't coming soon enough, she grabs gloves to deliver the baby herself, even though, she says, the academy didn't give her medical training.\n\nExactly what training Teresa has becomes murkier. If the high-stakes situation doesn't immediately indicate that \"A Cop Movie\" isn't playing by ordinary documentary rules, the splashy wide-screen compositions, use of zooms as punctuation, careful camera setups and subjects' habit of commenting toward the viewer all signal that something is up. By the time Teresa is breaking the fourth wall - yes, there's a fourth wall - while cradling a colleague who has been shot, Ruizpalacios is clearly employing dramatization. Narrative expectations come into play when he reveals that Teresa and her partner, Montoya, are romantically involved.\n\nIt would be easy to give too much away, but \"A Cop Movie,\" viewed one way, is a fake documentary that establishes its unreliability, then recasts itself as a documentary of a deception. It equates performing official duties with playing a character; the audience's distrust may mirror a civilian's distrust for authority. And as in the Stanford prison experiment , the uniform makes the officer.\n\nA Cop Movie Rated R. Violence and a bit of sex. In Spanish, with subtitles. Running time: 1 hour 47 minutes.

It follows a rookie cop - don't they always? - and his by-the-book training officer on the Long Beach, Calif., police force on their patrols and interactions, not in interrogation rooms or labs, and everything is very taut if superficial.\n\nAmong its draws is that Dick Wolf is an executive producer of the show, which was created by his son Elliot Wolf and Tim Walsh. \"Executive Producer Dick Wolf\" is a phrase etched in the minds of TV fans, nobler perhaps in its \"Law & Order\"s than in its \"Chicago\"s or \"F.B.I.\"s. This series has many of his signatures: officers who take things too personally on account of their painful back stories, police lingo 101 and criminals whose clunky villainy could be ripped from a comic book. One of the big bads here is a gang member named \"Maniac.\" Maniac! Gee, what's he like?\n\nBut \"On Call\" is not a flat procedural. Its eight episodes are largely serialized and have the tense velocity that is the raison d'être for cop shows in the first place. Its use of bodycam footage adds an air of realism and a camera-shaking chaos, and there is a healthy serving of grimy violence.\n\nThe show also cannily has its copaganda and eats it too. Harmon (Troian Bellisario) is our ethical rule-follower, embodied by her tight hairdo, who disavows police violence and tries to educate her protégé, Diaz (Brandon Larracuente), on the virtues and nuances of decency. He, too, strives for a more holistic approach. When another newbie cop seems too eager about \"chasing bad guys,\" Diaz is more restrained. \"I guess you got to define bad guys these days,\" he muses. His mom hates cops, and for good reason, so he gets it.\n\nVeteran officers decry this approach as naïve, out of touch, enabling. The sergeant (Eriq La Salle, also an executive producer and director of several episodes) scoffs at Diaz and sighs. \"I came up a million years ago when you handled your business,\" he says. \"Now everybody's so woke no one wants to put [expletive] in jail.\"\n\nThe abbreviated running time for \"On Call\" works mostly to its advantage, the current sweeping you along without time to get too distracted by, say, Lori Loughlin playing a lieutenant. This also helps the show feel less formulaic than it truly is, its rhythms less predictable.\n\nMargaret Lyons is a television critic at The Times, and writes the TV parts of the Watching newsletter .\n\nAdvertisement"

Opponents argue that it would further militarize officers and destroy precious green space.\n\nBy Adeel Hassan and Sean Keenan\n\nAtlanta's plan to build a sprawling police and fire training center amid a 1,000-acre stretch of urban woodland has become the focus of intense protest, drawing opposition from environmentalists who want to preserve the woods and activists who say the center will accelerate the militarization of the police.\n\nThe protesters, who refer to the planned training center as \"Cop City,\" also include people who are opposed to the corporate funding of the $90 million project. Some have set up barricades at the site, taken up residence in trees, damaged property and come into direct confrontation with the authorities.\n\nIn January, police officers tried to expel demonstrators from the woods, and what they described as a shootout left one protester dead, a state trooper seriously wounded and Georgia's governor authorizing the National Guard to intervene.\n\nCity officials say that the site is needed to replace inadequate training facilities and would become one of the largest such centers in the country. They have said that some of the protesters have crossed the line from civil disobedience into domestic terrorism.\n\nHere's what to know about the project and the opposition to it.\n\nAfter months of delays and debate, the City Council voted 10 to 4 in 2021 to authorize the project, officially named the Atlanta Public Safety Training Center, on property owned by the city in DeKalb County.\n\nThe land has been leased to the Atlanta Police Foundation, a nonprofit which is raising about $60 million for the new campus. The foundation receives financial contributions directly from many of the area's largest companies, or through its philanthropic arms. Many of those companies' executives serve on the foundation's board.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

The beleaguered Captain Jeffrey Friedman (Paul Reiser) thinks the older and slower Axel should reconnect with his estranged daughter, Jane (Taylour Paige), who works as a defense attorney in Los Angeles. She is representing someone accused of killing a possible dirty cop. When masked men dangle Jane's car with her inside from a roof, Axel, at the request of his longtime pal Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold), comes to Los Angeles to find the culprits.\n\nMurphy returns with the same Detroit Lions jacket, his familiar chuckle and his movie star grin. But there's little to smile about in this painfully lackluster retread desperately trying to justify its own existence.\n\nIn his feature directing debut, Mark Molloy - who plied his trade making commercials - tries to imagine a world where Axel is no longer a beloved wisecracker. Jane hates Axel for abandoning her as a child. Her former flame, Detective Bobby Abbott (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), who later teams up with Axel, also thinks Axel's penchant for public destruction is outdated. Axel's ruminations on parenting and policing are short-lived in the face of the flashy Captain Cade Grant (Kevin Bacon), who seems to be actively impeding Axel's investigation as a bemused Chief John Taggart (John Ashton) looks on.\n\nMolloy's film ( streaming on Netflix ) is a slog: The dirty cop mystery is half-baked; the visual effects are half-rendered; the action lacks any sense of physical space. In the opening scene, Axel's attempt to stop a robbery in the Red Wings' locker room becomes a shaky street chase with Axel in a snowplow and the robbers on bikes. Rather than film the scene as a cohesive shot, Molloy filmed the bikers and Murphy separately. The result is a scattered set piece without any visual cohesion.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

But shows are evolving to reflect the new climate.\n\nJimmy Smits on the set of \"East New York,\" a new CBS police show developed after the killing of George Floyd that aims to take a more nuanced view of policing. Credit... George Etheredge for The New York Times\n\nSupported by\n\nBy Marc Tracy\n\nIn 2020 the police killings of George Floyd and other Black people spurred many Americans to take a hard look at the police. Including the police on TV.\n\nTwo ride-along reality programs, including the decades-old \"Cops,\" were taken off the air . The police comedy \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\" rethought its final season. As critics called for a radical re-examination of what some called \"copaganda\" shows, the actor, writer and director Issa Rae told The Hollywood Reporter that if she were writing one, she would make it about community policing. \"Hopefully,\" she said, it would be \"a boring, uneventful show that would get canceled.\"\n\nTwo years later, it is clear that rumors of the cop show's demise were greatly exaggerated. \"Cops\" is back, now on the Fox Nation streaming service. Eighteen crime-related programs are slated for prime-time slots on the major broadcast networks; three of the five most-viewed scripted network shows last season featured law enforcement (a fourth was about firefighters). The industry's attitude was perhaps summarized at the Emmy Awards ceremony in September, when stars from the \"Law & Order\" franchise were introduced by the comedian Sam Jay as \"two cops no one wants to see defunded.\"\n\nBut beneath the surface, there are signs that the genre has been evolving in response to the current climate, which saw public trust in law enforcement reach a record low two years ago, even as a political backlash to some of the sharpest slogans, like \"Defund the Police,\" began to form.\n\nA new hourlong police drama called \"East New York,\" which premiered Sunday evening on CBS, is part of a wave of crime shows that have been developed or rethought since Floyd's death. It aims to explore the world of law enforcement in a more nuanced way, even featuring plotlines about, yes, community policing. One of its stars, Jimmy Smits, who was on the more in-your-face \"N.Y.P.D. Blue\" in the 1990s, said he was drawn to \"East New York\" by the chance to tell a different kind of policing story.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "\"A Cop Movie,\" Reviewed: A Revelatory Docu-Fiction About Police in Mexico\n\nGenre in general is a marketing tool, but the label \"nonfiction\" is a matter of ethics. In the new film \"A Cop Movie\" (coming Friday to Netflix), the director Alonso Ruizpalacios plays fast and loose with the idea and the practice of nonfiction, but his methods nonetheless do justice to both. The film is a hybrid of documentary and dramatic reënactment, though even saying as much up front is nearly a spoiler, because the movie tips its hand only subtly and winkingly before putting its cards on the table. Ruizpalacios's unusual, cagey, elusive cinematic gamesmanship does more than present a fascinating and significant array of events; his elaborate form provides access-albeit obliquely-to events that would likely escape straightforward reporting, and to deep-rooted social conditions that would otherwise be hard to depict.\n\nA female police officer named Teresa is keeping watch over the streets of Mexico City by night, alone, at the wheel of her patrol car. The dispatchers on the police radio deliver updates in code and also describe developing situations-a street fight, a truck accident-and send Teresa to an unspecified emergency that turns out to be a woman in labor. She is on the verge of giving birth, with no ambulance in sight or, for that matter, available. Teresa, who discusses her police work both on camera and in voice-over, relates the story-she'd had no training in delivering a child-while Ruizpalacios shows the baby emerging, Teresa handing the newborn to the exhausted and ecstatic mother, figuring out how to cut the umbilical cord, and awaiting the placenta. The paramedics show up long after the baby was born (and, she says, only wanted to take the placenta, because female doctors use it as a beauty aid); the grateful new parents decide to name the newborn after Teresa.\n\nIn granular detail and with extraordinary perceptiveness, Ruizpalacios depicts Teresa's work and conducts revealing interviews with her. His methods are surprisingly intrusive, as when the camera crew pushes close behind her to record the childbirth. When Teresa speaks about her decision to join the force, seventeen years before, when she was seventeen-over the opposition of her father, who is also an officer-she's filmed through the windshield of her patrol car. It's an archetypal shot, familiar from any number of cop movies, and the way it's composed here suggests that it wasn't grabbed on the fly but set up with fiction-like forethought.\n\nRuizpalacios films Teresa (whose full name is María Teresa Hernández Cañas) stopping, searching, and arresting a driver. Then, with the suspect in the backseat, Teresa drives off and continues to relate her family story. Later, she's on another patrol with two male officers who see a driver driving the wrong way on a one-way street and describe him as their \"meal ticket.\" While they're shaking him down, a shoot-out occurs and one of the officers is wounded, and Teresa continues her narration to the camera while she's cradling him. Ruizpalacios's access to shocking events is so close and intimate that it seems too good to be true-and, indeed, the viewer who is skeptical of his apparently unfiltered access to such dangerous events, or of Teresa's response, is amply rewarded when Ruizpalacios ultimately reveals how the filming was done. (I'm deliberately being vague so as not to ruin the experience of  watching this intellectual mystery unfold.)\n\nA second officer, a man called Montoya, also talks, while on duty, of his youth and his path to the police. A child in a high-crime neighborhood, growing up among criminals, he followed in the footsteps of his older brother, a special-forces officer who brought his colleagues-and their heavy weaponry-to the house, and taught him to handle firearms. Yet when Montoya (whose name is José de Jesús Rodríguez Hernández) joined the force, he insisted on an assignment outside his neighborhood because he feared that anyone he arrested would take revenge on his family. It turns out that Teresa and Montoya are a couple, who met at work and asked to be partnered together-their colleagues call them the Love Patrol. Ruizpalacios films them at home, speaking of their courtship. (Teresa told her boss that she'd bribe him to be partnered with Montoya.) What's more, when Montoya talks about his self-destructive inclinations-which Teresa helped him to overcome-his story is illustrated on camera, in flashbacks conspicuously reënacted by Montoya (who feared seeing a therapist lest he be declared unfit for duty). There's a wonderful intersection of the two officers' stories, depicted with a cannily staged delight almost too good to be accidental, centered on the sweet domestic trivia of a set of keys forgotten at home and tossed down from the balcony. There's also a chase scene, involving both Teresa and Montoya pursuing a suspect into a subway station, that is filmed amazingly, implausibly, as if the camera operators are everywhere at once.\n\nAbout an hour into the movie, Ruizpalacios reveals the involvement of a pair of actors, Mónica del Carmen and Raúl Briones, in the proceedings. When he discloses their identities, he also interviews them at length about their experience pretending to be officers. In addition, he delivers an extraordinary extra layer of backstory: the actors actually attend police academy and generate their own, covert cell-phone videos of what they witness there, and their observations fuse with the details of Teresa and Montoya's actual work to produce a disturbing vision of dysfunction within the force and in society at large. The actors note, for instance, the haste and inadequacy of the training that the recruits receive before being sent into the streets with weapons-and attribute it to the large need for new officers to quickly replace the many who are killed on duty.)\n\nOfficers are seen accepting bribes-for instance, Montoya directs traffic to allow a group of schoolchildren to cross, and the guardian of one of them covertly slips coins into his hand-and also giving bribes, as Teresa does, to a department clerk, when she needs paperwork filled out, or as both officers do, at the window where they pick up their weapons and bulletproof vests. Teresa explains that without making those payoffs, they'd get worse guns and dirty vests; what's more, she says, she's also expected to pay off her superiors, and those payoffs go, in turn, up the ladder to the highest officials. Just as bribery trickles up, the effects of corruption trickle down-the minimal police training is done with ludicrously improvised equipment (a trainer jokes sardonically about the \"state-of-the-art\" cardboard targets used on a shooting range). A shocking incident of corruption involves Teresa's attempt to confront someone in brazen public defiance of the law, who turns out to be under the protection of higher-ups-who instead investigate her.\n\nRuizpalacios hears from a wide range of figures, including a bunch of recruits, other officers, passersby, a barber, and the symphony of second-hand voices that Teresa and Montoya deliver in their interviews with the director. \"A Cop Movie\" is the 2021 version of Alan and Susan Raymond's groundbreaking 1976 documentary \" The Police Tapes .\" Ruizpalacios updates the Raymonds' embedded, participatory methods with a new form-one that feels apt at a time when the ethics and the law of consent, governmental wariness regarding media, and the slippery trade-offs involving journalistic access are invisibly but decisively shaping documentary images. Along with its trenchant, revelatory depictions and discussion of police work and related political ills, \"A Cop Movie\" pulls these hidden vectors of image-making, opinion-shaping power to the fore.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "Can \"Cop City\" Be Stopped at the Ballot Box?\n\nTwo months ago, I walked to City Hall, in Atlanta, to watch hundreds of angry people talk to their elected officials. Atlanta's city council was set to vote on funding for one of the largest police-and-firefighter-training facilities in the country, which has come to be known, pejoratively, as Cop City-a reference, originally, to a mock village that was part of the proposed complex. The facility, slated to be built on at least eighty-five acres in the South River Forest -a verdant, unincorporated part of DeKalb County, twenty minutes from downtown Atlanta-was endorsed in early 2021 by Keisha Lance Bottoms, then the mayor of Atlanta. Bottoms, a Democrat elected four years earlier with talk of transparency at City Hall and the need for affordable housing, cited rising crime and declining police morale in explaining her support. That May, she announced that she would not seek reëlection. Another Democrat, Andre Dickens, was elected that November, and Cop City became his problem.\n\nBy then, protesters calling themselves \"forest defenders\" had set up camp at the proposed site and were beginning to have skirmishes with police and construction crews. This past January, one of the protesters, Manuel (Tortuguita) Terán, was shot and killed by police officers, who fired at least fifty-seven rounds. Authorities claimed that Terán was armed and shot first, but an autopsy did not provide evidence that Terán discharged a weapon. (The officers involved were not wearing body cameras.) By May, more than forty protesters had been charged with domestic terrorism. A number of them had their bail paid by the Atlanta Solidarity Fund, which is run by a nonprofit. A month later, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation sent SWAT teams to arrest three of the fund's organizers, on charges of money laundering and charity fraud.\n\n\"In terms of sustained damage to the body politic, this is the worst thing that's ever happened to us,\" Howard Shook, the city council's longest-serving member, told me, on the phone, as I walked to City Hall. Nonetheless, Shook, who represents a wealthy district in north Atlanta, supports the project. \"It got off on the wrong foot,\" he said. \"Everyone's been paying the price for a bad first impression.\" Two weeks before we spoke, the Atlanta Community Press Collective had revealed that the facility would cost taxpayers some sixty-seven million dollars, rather than thirty million, as the city had previously claimed. The total budget is ninety million; the rest will be paid by the Atlanta Police Foundation, a nonprofit that raises money for the Atlanta Police Department from some of the largest corporations in the city. The proposed facility's chief fund-raiser was Alex Taylor, a member of the super-wealthy Cox family. The family's company, Cox Enterprises, owns the city's biggest newspaper, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution , and critics have charged that the paper's coverage of Cop City has been less thorough than that of smaller local outlets. A spokesperson for the paper noted that the Journal-Constitution had published more than a hundred stories on the topic, by six different reporters. \"Community members and others can have differing opinions on the conclusions of the reporting,\" the spokesperson wrote in an e-mail, \"but we operate with the highest journalistic standards.\"\n\nThe budgetary discrepancy seemed typical of the project's shifting nature-\"I still don't know what exactly is proposed,\" Shirley Franklin, who was the mayor of Atlanta from 2002 to 2010, told me recently-and the collective's reporting raised hopes among Cop City opponents that the council might send the proposal back to its finance committee. But Shook dismissed the idea. \"We've got to have a state-of-the-art facility,\" he said. \"So I'm for it.\" I asked him what would be lost by pausing a bit longer before building one of the largest such facilities in the country, even as violent crime, and homicide specifically, trends back down in the city. \"Look, the baby is crowning,\" he said. \"We can't shove it back up there for two more weeks.\"\n\nWhen I reached City Hall, it was packed with protesters, media, and at least three dozen uniformed police. I stood near a line that snaked into the council's chamber, chatting with attendees and watching speakers on a big screen in the atrium. A period of public comment began-and lasted longer than fourteen hours, stretching into the next morning. More than three hundred people spoke, and nearly all were opposed to the facility, expressing concerns that ranged from the rise of a police state to the questionable wisdom of razing a forested area as climate change accelerates. The founder of a school , a local artist, and a descendant of the Indigenous Muscogee people who once lived in the forest each made their own cases against the project. A former federal prosecutor, Alex Joseph, suggested that an existing training facility, in another county, could suffice. Many of the speakers cited Atlanta's role in the civil-rights movement, and noted that those who opposed the training facility appeared to be facing the same repressive tactics-police violence, dubious legal charges-that Martin Luther King, Jr. , and his allies had faced sixty years before.\n\nThe fifteen council members watched mostly impassively at first, from a raised platform. As the day wore on, though, frustration mounted, along with hunger and fatigue. Sporadic shouting broke out. \"If you build it, we will burn it,\" a man said. A council member who opposes the project lamented that some of their colleagues had received death threats owing to their position on the issue. At one point, City Hall elevators stopped working; it seemed to some protesters that the building itself was pitted against them. (\"They have not been shut down,\" a council member told the crowd.) Around five-thirty in the morning, just before the sun began to rise, the council approved the facility's funding by a vote of eleven to four-just about the margin that Howard Shook had predicted on the phone with me, eighteen hours earlier.\n\nThe core members of the Cop City opposition weren't surprised, either, and had already hatched a backup plan. \"Many of us had a Spidey sense that the council was going to vote to move on Cop City, and move the resources to it,\" Mary Hooks, an Atlanta-based organizer with the Movement for Black Lives, told me. \"That's when we said, 'All right, after that, within a day or two, we should go ahead and announce that this new tactic is going to emerge.' \" The new tactic involved an old staple of direct democracy: the referendum. Within twenty-four hours of the council's vote, a \"Stop Cop City\" referendum petition was filed and made public.\n\nA paragraph in Georgia's constitution grants residents what's known as home rule: the right to challenge the decisions of local government through a referendum. Such referendums are rare in Georgia, and difficult to bring: at least fifteen per cent of a relevant municipality's registered voters must sign a petition calling for one. Last year, however, a referendum was successfully brought in Camden County, five hours south of Atlanta, challenging a spaceport that Camden County's board of commissioners had already approved. (A former governor had reportedly pitched the project to Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX.) The necessary signatures were collected, and the project was voted down handily. The county challenged the referendum effort-pointing to, among other things, \"duplicate and inconsistent\" voter signatures-and, later, its result. But, in February, the Supreme Court of Georgia upheld the vote, and home rule. (Two of the court's judges, in a concurring opinion, expressed concern that \"groups within a community will be empowered to regularly subject their local community to the expense of a series of referenda as a means of either protest or in an attempt to thwart the will of a fatigued majority in a low turnout election.\")\n\nCamden isn't the only precedent, though. More than two decades ago, citizens of Claxton, in southeast Georgia, pushed for a referendum to reverse the closing of railroad crossings in their city, and, in 1998, Georgia's Supreme Court ruled against them. I asked Zohra Ahmed, an assistant professor at the University of Georgia School of Law, about these conflicting precedents. The Claxton case, like the Cop City referendum, concerned a municipality, she said, but it's older than the Camden decision, \"and the more recent case, in general, is more persuasive.\" Ahmed also felt that the court had \"selectively read\" the constitutional provision in the Claxton case.\n\nThe \"Stop Cop City\" referendum calls for a repeal of the ordinance authorizing the Atlanta Police Foundation's lease on the land where the facility would be built. A coalition of groups, including the Community Movement Builders, Working Families Party, and the Movement for Black Lives, is now working to collect the needed signatures. The groups say they need about sixty thousand signatures, but are hoping to collect at least ten thousand more than that, as a buffer against potential challenges. They aim to have them by August 21st, with the goal of getting on the ballot in November. (A judge extended the deadline to late September, but, the later the signatures arrive, the more likely it is that the referendum will get pushed to a ballot early next year, amid the Republican Presidential primary. The City of Atlanta has appealed the extended deadline.)\n\nA few hundred volunteers, plus some paid workers, fanned out across the city, heading to grocery stores, dog parks, skating rinks, bars, and a \"church crawl.\" In some places, they found that news of the referendum had preceded them. Hooks told me about stopping by a grocery store in the predominantly Black neighborhood of Westview and seeing a poster about the referendum up on the wall. \"They had the petitions right at the checkout counter and had the palm cards already,\" Hooks said. \"They were already talking to folks coming through the line. I was, like, 'Cool. I'll go somewhere else.' \"\n\nIn early July, I went to a neighborhood meeting to hear debate about limiting a road near my home to pedestrian traffic-and recognized Alex Joseph, the former federal prosecutor I'd seen offer comments at City Hall. She had seized on the opportunity to deliver a presentation on the \"Stop Cop City\" referendum. \"I don't get out of bed for fewer than five signatures,\" she said, drawing laughter. Joseph's ten-minute pitch touched on environmental disenfranchisement, the cost to taxpayers, and the recent news that Fulton County, which includes much of Atlanta, also plans to build a smaller-scale police-training academy, which would be \"more convenient\" to use, according to the county manager. \"Fulton County taxpayers are gonna be paying for two of these,\" Joseph said. \"And the Fulton County one is fifteen million dollars. So why is the other one ninety?\"\n\nWhat's more, Joseph went on, there was an existing training facility that local police could also use. \"I used to send people to prison,\" Joseph said, referring to her past career as a prosecutor, \"and I want you to know that there is a perfectly good police-training facility in Forsyth, Georgia,\" about an hour away from downtown Atlanta. \"Not only does it exist-I've been there!\" she went on. \"I've taught there! It's very funny to me when people say, 'You don't believe in police being trained!' I'm, like, 'I literally used to train them.' \" Before ceding the floor, she said, \"If you love democracy, sign! The next stage is we cancel this lease and we discuss a different solution.\" She got fifteen signatures.\n\nMeanwhile, the city of Atlanta has pushed back against the referendum effort in federal court. In mid-July, lawyers for the city argued that Atlanta cannot revoke its lease to the Atlanta Police Foundation, which has already been signed: \"Repeal of a years' old ordinance cannot retroactively revoke authorization to do something that has already been done,\" they said in a court filing. When I asked Alex Joseph about this, she pointed to Camden County. \"We are confident that we are on firm legal footing,\" she said.\n\nOn a very hot afternoon a few days later, a twenty-eight-year-old named Jax Crowder went signature-collecting at a Trader Joe's in midtown Atlanta. Crowder, who was raised in northern Kentucky in a family of law-enforcement officers, served in the Navy, worked as a wrestling coach, and, until recently, belonged to the Libertarian Party. Crowder and another volunteer got three signatures in the grocery store's parking lot before a manager came outside and told them that, although he supported the effort, they needed to leave. At a nearby Starbucks, they got two more. \"You want me to sign something? Because I will,\" a therapist in her thirties told Crowder as she headed to a nearby UPS store. Crowder began explaining the facility's price tag. \"Yeah, it's all fucking ridiculous,\" the therapist said.\n\nA short drive away, the canvass continued in a wealthy neighborhood where many yards had signs advertising the progressive beliefs of their residents. \"We Believe Black Lives Matter, Love Is Love, Feminism Is for Everyone, No Human Being Is Illegal, Science Is Real, Be Kind to All,\" one sign announced. When Crowder rang the bell at that house, a middle-aged man opened the door, saw them, and turned away with a wave of his hand. It was the same sort of thing at a few more homes. For forty-five minutes, Crowder walked up and down long driveways without getting a single signature. One man said he planned to sign that weekend at a neighbor's gathering about the effort; another had company; a woman said she needed her husband, a lawyer, to look at the fine print first. (She eventually signed the petition.)\n\nFinally, Crowder found someone willing to talk: Nidhi Williams, a scientist who had just returned from picking up dinner. She told Crowder that she had worried about her son, who is now in his twenties, growing up in a more militarized world than she had grown up in. \"The first thing I taught my child is, if a cop stops you, do not say a word, just say 'I want to make my phone call, I want to call my father, call my mother,' \" she said. \"Cops are not considered safety people anymore.\" She went on, \"I have no idea what their job is anymore. . . . Give us community people. Go back to the times when we could talk things out.\"\n\nAs Williams spoke to Crowder, her friend Deepika Bahri, a professor of English at Emory University, drove up. She'd recently hosted a signing party where she'd gathered about fifteen signatures, she said. \"I think we shouldn't dismiss the police force's concerns about a viable training facility,\" Bahri said. \"But they could have it elsewhere.\" The South River Forest was too precious. \"That much canopy cover, this is one of the best things that Atlanta has going for it,\" she said. \"My relatives come from Toronto, and they can't get over how green and wonderful it is. Like, no, we don't give up that much coverage. . . . Everybody is affected by the loss of canopy.\"\n\nOn August 9th, Bernice King, a daughter of Martin Luther King, Jr., and the C.E.O. of the King Center, threw her support behind the referendum campaign, signing a public letter that described the proposed location and public cost of the training center as a \"misstep.\" By then, the campaign reported having more than fifty thousand logged signatures sitting in a vault. Another ten thousand, they thought, perhaps with some optimism, were still out in the field, in the hands of the volunteers collecting them. But, in the final weeks, the campaign scrambled to get more, expecting plenty of challenges from the city, which would have nearly two months to review the signatures. I reached out to Mayor Dickens to ask whether he believes that Atlanta voters should be able to decide, after all the conflict and concern expressed in the past two years, whether to build the training center in the South River Forest. A spokesperson, in an e-mail, disputed the notion that a referendum could repeal a city ordinance. This initiative, he wrote, \"would violate the constitutional prohibition on the impairment of contracts. That said,\" he added, \"we welcome public dialogue and engagement around our goal to build the most progressive Public Safety Training Center in the nation.\" ♦\n\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the minimum proportion of a municipality's registered voters who must sign a petition in order to successfully call a referendum.\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "\"A Cop Movie,\" Reviewed: A Revelatory Docu-Fiction About Police in Mexico\n\nGenre in general is a marketing tool, but the label \"nonfiction\" is a matter of ethics. In the new film \"A Cop Movie\" (coming Friday to Netflix), the director Alonso Ruizpalacios plays fast and loose with the idea and the practice of nonfiction, but his methods nonetheless do justice to both. The film is a hybrid of documentary and dramatic reënactment, though even saying as much up front is nearly a spoiler, because the movie tips its hand only subtly and winkingly before putting its cards on the table. Ruizpalacios's unusual, cagey, elusive cinematic gamesmanship does more than present a fascinating and significant array of events; his elaborate form provides access-albeit obliquely-to events that would likely escape straightforward reporting, and to deep-rooted social conditions that would otherwise be hard to depict.\n\nA female police officer named Teresa is keeping watch over the streets of Mexico City by night, alone, at the wheel of her patrol car. The dispatchers on the police radio deliver updates in code and also describe developing situations-a street fight, a truck accident-and send Teresa to an unspecified emergency that turns out to be a woman in labor. She is on the verge of giving birth, with no ambulance in sight or, for that matter, available. Teresa, who discusses her police work both on camera and in voice-over, relates the story-she'd had no training in delivering a child-while Ruizpalacios shows the baby emerging, Teresa handing the newborn to the exhausted and ecstatic mother, figuring out how to cut the umbilical cord, and awaiting the placenta. The paramedics show up long after the baby was born (and, she says, only wanted to take the placenta, because female doctors use it as a beauty aid); the grateful new parents decide to name the newborn after Teresa.\n\nIn granular detail and with extraordinary perceptiveness, Ruizpalacios depicts Teresa's work and conducts revealing interviews with her. His methods are surprisingly intrusive, as when the camera crew pushes close behind her to record the childbirth. When Teresa speaks about her decision to join the force, seventeen years before, when she was seventeen-over the opposition of her father, who is also an officer-she's filmed through the windshield of her patrol car. It's an archetypal shot, familiar from any number of cop movies, and the way it's composed here suggests that it wasn't grabbed on the fly but set up with fiction-like forethought.\n\nRuizpalacios films Teresa (whose full name is María Teresa Hernández Cañas) stopping, searching, and arresting a driver. Then, with the suspect in the backseat, Teresa drives off and continues to relate her family story. Later, she's on another patrol with two male officers who see a driver driving the wrong way on a one-way street and describe him as their \"meal ticket.\" While they're shaking him down, a shoot-out occurs and one of the officers is wounded, and Teresa continues her narration to the camera while she's cradling him. Ruizpalacios's access to shocking events is so close and intimate that it seems too good to be true-and, indeed, the viewer who is skeptical of his apparently unfiltered access to such dangerous events, or of Teresa's response, is amply rewarded when Ruizpalacios ultimately reveals how the filming was done. (I'm deliberately being vague so as not to ruin the experience of  watching this intellectual mystery unfold.)\n\nA second officer, a man called Montoya, also talks, while on duty, of his youth and his path to the police. A child in a high-crime neighborhood, growing up among criminals, he followed in the footsteps of his older brother, a special-forces officer who brought his colleagues-and their heavy weaponry-to the house, and taught him to handle firearms. Yet when Montoya (whose name is José de Jesús Rodríguez Hernández) joined the force, he insisted on an assignment outside his neighborhood because he feared that anyone he arrested would take revenge on his family. It turns out that Teresa and Montoya are a couple, who met at work and asked to be partnered together-their colleagues call them the Love Patrol. Ruizpalacios films them at home, speaking of their courtship. (Teresa told her boss that she'd bribe him to be partnered with Montoya.) What's more, when Montoya talks about his self-destructive inclinations-which Teresa helped him to overcome-his story is illustrated on camera, in flashbacks conspicuously reënacted by Montoya (who feared seeing a therapist lest he be declared unfit for duty). There's a wonderful intersection of the two officers' stories, depicted with a cannily staged delight almost too good to be accidental, centered on the sweet domestic trivia of a set of keys forgotten at home and tossed down from the balcony. There's also a chase scene, involving both Teresa and Montoya pursuing a suspect into a subway station, that is filmed amazingly, implausibly, as if the camera operators are everywhere at once.\n\nAbout an hour into the movie, Ruizpalacios reveals the involvement of a pair of actors, Mónica del Carmen and Raúl Briones, in the proceedings. When he discloses their identities, he also interviews them at length about their experience pretending to be officers. In addition, he delivers an extraordinary extra layer of backstory: the actors actually attend police academy and generate their own, covert cell-phone videos of what they witness there, and their observations fuse with the details of Teresa and Montoya's actual work to produce a disturbing vision of dysfunction within the force and in society at large. The actors note, for instance, the haste and inadequacy of the training that the recruits receive before being sent into the streets with weapons-and attribute it to the large need for new officers to quickly replace the many who are killed on duty.)\n\nOfficers are seen accepting bribes-for instance, Montoya directs traffic to allow a group of schoolchildren to cross, and the guardian of one of them covertly slips coins into his hand-and also giving bribes, as Teresa does, to a department clerk, when she needs paperwork filled out, or as both officers do, at the window where they pick up their weapons and bulletproof vests. Teresa explains that without making those payoffs, they'd get worse guns and dirty vests; what's more, she says, she's also expected to pay off her superiors, and those payoffs go, in turn, up the ladder to the highest officials. Just as bribery trickles up, the effects of corruption trickle down-the minimal police training is done with ludicrously improvised equipment (a trainer jokes sardonically about the \"state-of-the-art\" cardboard targets used on a shooting range). A shocking incident of corruption involves Teresa's attempt to confront someone in brazen public defiance of the law, who turns out to be under the protection of higher-ups-who instead investigate her.\n\nRuizpalacios hears from a wide range of figures, including a bunch of recruits, other officers, passersby, a barber, and the symphony of second-hand voices that Teresa and Montoya deliver in their interviews with the director. \"A Cop Movie\" is the 2021 version of Alan and Susan Raymond's groundbreaking 1976 documentary \" The Police Tapes .\" Ruizpalacios updates the Raymonds' embedded, participatory methods with a new form-one that feels apt at a time when the ethics and the law of consent, governmental wariness regarding media, and the slippery trade-offs involving journalistic access are invisibly but decisively shaping documentary images. Along with its trenchant, revelatory depictions and discussion of police work and related political ills, \"A Cop Movie\" pulls these hidden vectors of image-making, opinion-shaping power to the fore.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "What if Your Abusive Husband Is a Cop?\n\nJessica Lester's friends persuaded her to date Matthew Boynton, a boy in the eleventh grade, by saying, \"If you don't like him, you can always break up.\" He was the grandson of the sheriff of Spalding County, where they lived, an hour south of Atlanta, and his friends were football players and cheerleaders. Jessica thought that Matthew, who was baby-faced but muscular, looked rich; he wore Ralph Lauren boots and collared shirts from Hollister. Jessica, who was in tenth grade, was less popular. She wore hand-me-downs and liked to take nature photographs. Her parents had abandoned her when she was three, along with her sister and brother, and she grew up on a farm with her mother's adoptive parents. \"I guess she felt like 'Matthew could have picked anybody, and for some reason he picked me,' \" her sister, Dusty, said.\n\nJessica had pale-green eyes, a melodic voice, and blond hair that hung down her back like a slab of wood. In the spring of 2013, when she was sixteen and had dated Matthew for a year, she took her grandparents into the kitchen, closed the door, and told them, apologizing, that she was pregnant. Jessica's grandparents, who are Baptist, were willing to help her bring up the child, but Jessica decided to settle down with Matthew, her first boyfriend. Her aunt Kathy, who lives on the farm, said, \"With Jessica's family background, there was probably just a feeling of 'Oh, I've finally found someone who loves me.' \"\n\nJessica and Matthew moved into a house across the street from the sheriff, Wendell Beam, and his wife. Jessica was the kind of intuitive mother who predicts a baby's danger-a fall, a spilled drink, a choking hazard-a few seconds before it happens. But she felt isolated. She finished her high-school coursework online, and almost never saw her friends or family. She said that Matthew told her she wasn't related to them by blood.\n\nFor their son's first Christmas, Matthew took Jessica to her grandparents' house-the first time she'd seen them in months-but before she opened her presents he told her that they had to leave. When Jessica graduated from high school, her grandparents held a party for her and projected a movie on the side of their barn. Shortly after the movie started, Matthew said that it was time to go. \"The rest of us enjoyed her graduation party,\" Martha, her grandmother, said.\n\nMatthew's childhood dream was to work in law enforcement-a career inspired by his grandfather, who had helped bring him up following his parents' divorce. After high school, he worked as a jailer at the Pike County sheriff's office before being hired as a patrol officer in Griffin, the largest city in Spalding County. In his personnel file there, a supervisor described him as \"fiercely loyal\" but \"stiff and unwilling to bend.\" Another officer described him as \"the type who wants to make ten arrests a day if he could.\" A senior officer privately advised Matthew, \"Lighten up a little bit, man.\"\n\nThat mentality spilled into his home life. Twice, Matthew called the police on Jessica, for yelling or cursing or poking his chest. According to a police report, Jessica was \"very reserved and appeared to be upset.\" She said that the officers recommended that she not yell at Matthew.\n\nIn December, 2014, Jessica had a brief affair and got pregnant again. Her family wondered if this was her way of escaping the relationship. But Matthew said that he'd raise the child as his own. They decided to get married. Jessica could never quite explain why-there was no proposal, just an understanding that there was too much momentum to break up. Martha worried that Jessica had \"lost her feistiness. It was almost like her personality got squished out of her.\"\n\nHer aunt Denise, a public-school teacher, said that, at the wedding, \"there was just this sadness in her eyes, like, 'I'm done.' \" She had the demeanor of a child who had promised herself not to cause trouble or draw attention to her own feelings. Jessica and Matthew left their wedding reception, which her family hosted, after less than an hour. Matthew wore a titanium wedding ring with a blue stripe, to signify that he was in law enforcement.\n\nThey rented an apartment in Griffin, in a complex of beige two-story buildings surrounding a swimming pool. But the sheriff still loomed large in their relationship. Matthew asked Beam to phone him in the morning to wake him up. Jessica didn't have her own credit card or car, so if she needed something from the supermarket she texted Matthew, who either took her to the store himself or asked Beam or his wife to deliver the item. When Matthew drove his patrol car, he would often take the keys to his truck, a Chevrolet Avalanche, so that Jessica couldn't use it.\n\nLink copied\n\nDenise was on a science-curriculum committee with Matthew's stepmother, Amy, a teacher in the same district. A few months after the wedding, Denise and Amy went out for lunch. Denise said that Amy confided that Matthew had once hit her and that their relationship was strained. \"She became dead serious-I'd never seen her so serious,\" Denise said. \"She said we needed to know what kind of kid he was. She said, 'Do me a favor. I want you to make sure that Jessica is going to be O.K., because he's going to hurt her.' \"\n\nIn the spring of 2016, less than six months after the wedding, Jessica discovered that Matthew was having an affair with Courtney Callaway, a dispatcher at the Spalding County sheriff's office, a mile away from the Griffin Police Department.\n\n\"If you don't want to be with me anymore,\" Jessica texted him, \"I'm not going to stay here and play house.\" Matthew, who had begun spending his free days with Callaway, told her, \"It's not gonna work for us. I already know it won't.\"\n\nJessica's grandmother made an appointment with a lawyer who could help her file for divorce. In a composition note­­book, Jessica documented the times she assumed Matthew had been with his girlfriend, and she jotted down notes for the lawyer. \"Difference between non-­contested & adultery divorce?\" she wrote. \" Most important to me . Custody (full?).\" She and the boys planned to move into her sister Dusty's house on Friday, April 15th, and the next week she would begin working at a chiropractor's office. \"She had both of the boys packed and ready to go,\" Dusty said.\n\nJessica had to wean her baby before starting the job, so on Thursday night she and Matthew drove to Walmart, to buy formula. At the store, they got into a fight, and when they left Jessica said she didn't want to get into the car. Matthew called a Griffin police lieutenant for advice. \"She's a grown lady,\" the lieutenant told him. \"You can't force her into the truck.\" (Matthew refused to comment for this story.)\n\nFrom her porch, Jessica's neighbor Megan Browning saw Jessica and Matthew return home. A half hour or so later, Browning was lying in bed when she heard a gunshot. Unnerved, she went out to the porch, where she heard another. Not long afterward, she saw Matthew walk briskly to his truck.\n\nHe drove to a nearby Waffle House to have a late dinner with a fellow Griffin police officer. On his way, at 12:54 a . m ., he said, he received a text from Jessica: \"I can't do this anymore. Take care of\" the children. \"Please tell them I love them everyday. I have been suffering for a while now and no one has noticed. Here lately I have not been able to recognize the person I see in the mirror. This is not the first time I have had suicide thoughts. I love you and the boys.\"\n\nA minute later, Matthew responded to a joke from Callaway. \"Haha I'm sorry I didn't think about that lol,\" he wrote. Then he called E.M.S. \"Can you please dispatch a unit out to my location?\" he said calmly. \"In reference to my wife.\" He explained that she was having suicidal thoughts and \"she told me to take care of the boys. So I'm trying to hurry up and get back home, just to make sure that nothing is going to happen to them.\"\n\nSix minutes later, Matthew reported on his police radio that he had heard two gunshots as he was walking up the stairs to his apartment. He had looked in the master bedroom, and when he didn't see the baby, who typically slept there, he ran outside. \"I didn't know if it was an active scenario,\" he later told investigators. \"I was scared to death, because I couldn't find him, that she would shoot me, shoot him, and then kill herself.\"\n\nEleven Griffin police officers arrived at the apartment complex. With their guns drawn, the officers checked every room in the house. The older boy was asleep in his bedroom, and the baby was in his own room, crying in his crib. The officers found Jessica in her bedroom closet, unconscious and lying on her side, her head on a bloody pillow. She was wearing fluffy slippers. On a shelf by her head was the notebook documenting Matthew's infidelity. Matthew's service gun was under her stomach.\n\nJessica's grandparents live on two hundred acres of farmland in Pike County, a twenty-five-minute drive from her apartment. A fence separates their house from an open field, where nine cows and two donkeys graze. Just before 2 a . m . on April 15th, Wendell Beam asked the sheriff of Pike County to send officers to the house. Two deputies woke Jessica's grandparents and told them that Jessica had committed suicide, using Matthew's gun. \"No, that doesn't ring right,\" Martha told them. Four of her grandchildren had taken target-shooting classes together, but Jessica had refused to participate. \"Jessica would not touch a gun,\" she said. \"She did not want to have anything to do with it.\"\n\nDusty and her husband drove to Jessica's apartment. The first officer she saw in the parking lot was Beam. The sheriff's department does not respond to incidents inside the Griffin city limits, and he was the only one from his office there. Dusty asked him where Jessica was, and he said that she had been taken by helicopter to Atlanta Medical Center. He did not explain why he'd earlier sent word that Jessica was dead. Dusty approached a group of Griffin police officers and asked whether Matthew had shot her sister. \"She loved those kids more than anything, and she knows how it feels to grow up without a mom,\" she said. \"She wouldn't have done that to them.\" The officers told Dusty she needed to either calm down or leave the property.\n\nThe police asked for assistance from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. Early that morning, Matthew was interviewed by Chris DeMarco, a G.B.I. agent who lived near Spalding County and had worked with Beam on several cases over the years. DeMarco told Matthew that his clothes might need to be collected as evidence. \"Absolutely,\" Matthew said. \"I didn't try to brush off anything. I didn't try to wash my hands-nothing.\" He sounded like an eager student. \"I didn't think about getting any other clothes.\"\n\nG.B.I. agents canvassed the apartment complex and discovered that Megan Browning and her fiancé and a couple that lived next door to Jessica were the only neighbors who had heard gunshots. Both couples said that the shots occurred around 11 p . m .-not at 1 a . m ., when Matthew had reported them. One of the neighbors said that, not long before he heard the gunshots, he also heard \"some banging, like she was banging on the door or something.\"\n\nBrowning, who sometimes socialized with Jessica and Matthew, cried throughout her interview. \"I hope he goes to jail for this shit,\" she said. She wanted to elaborate on what she'd witnessed, but the agents left after eight minutes and never came back.\n\nOn a hospital-admission form, Jessica was described as a \"19 year old reported to have shot herself in the right skull.\" But Vernon Henderson, a trauma surgeon for more than two decades, who treated Jessica, wrote that her injury \"did not fit with that description\"; neither of her hands had \"any evidence of any gunpowder stippling.\" And her wound was on the top of her skull, which suggested that she would have had to hold the gun above her head, pointing downward-\"a very unusual direction in which to point the gun at one's self with the intention of committing suicide,\" Henderson wrote. Indentations in the walls of Jessica's closet suggested that one bullet had been shot at an upward angle-it entered the wall near the top of the closet-and another bullet hit the wall near the floor. Her neurosurgeon, Paul King, told me, \"It seemed most likely that someone else shot her.\"\n\nJessica had an intracranial-pressure monitor inserted into her brain, to measure swelling, and she was put in a medically induced coma. Matthew's father and stepmother visited the next week. \"Amy fell to pieces,\" Denise said. \"I hug­ged her and said, 'It's going to be O.K.' And she said, 'No,' and looked at her husband.\" (Amy did not want to comment for this article, explaining in an e-mail, \"I have tried to remain neutral in this very serious situation.\")\n\nMatthew and the boys temporarily moved in with Courtney Callaway, the dispatcher he was dating. In Jessica's first three weeks in the hospital, he visited her once, accompanied by Beam, who wore his uniform and carried his gun. \"I made sure that I had another party with me, to insure the accusations wouldn't be made,\" Matthew said later.\n\nAfter the visit, Matthew, who had been placed on administrative leave, was interviewed again by DeMarco. \"The chief would eventually like to get his officer back, as well as his service weapon back,\" DeMarco told Matthew. \"So we're going to try to expedite this as fast as possible, and, when I say expedite, I mean the next few weeks.\" DeMarco assured Matthew that his phone, which had been seized during the investigation, would be returned. \"That's what I told your-That's what I told the sheriff today,\" he said.\n\nShortly after Jessica was hospitalized, her aunt Kathy took a photograph of a C-shaped bruise on the back of Jessica's head, and she shared it with the G.B.I. agents, asking them to investigate how Jessica had been injured there. She suspected that there had been a physical altercation leading up to the gunshots. Although it's possible that Jessica's head hit the wall after she shot herself, there was no blood on the wall or on the clothes in the closet. Only the pillow under her head was bloody. A G.B.I. summary of an interview with King, the neurosurgeon, noted that he called the circumstances of her injury \"suspicious,\" but the agent who conducted the interview failed to record the conversation; he hadn't charged his audio recorder. King told me, \"You'd think it would have been simple enough to put bags on her hands and test them for gunshot residue. I was wondering why, but then it came to pass that her husband was a police officer and his granddaddy was the sheriff, so I understood.\"\n\nMatthew and Callaway broke up a few weeks later. In an interview with the police, she said that she found him intimidating. \"I know that he's a police officer, and I'm not really anybody,\" she said.\n\nIn early May, after three weeks in a coma, Jessica began to regain consciousness. She silently surveyed the walls, where her family had taped pictures of her sons. A few days later, Kathy noticed Jessica crying. She was watching a cartoon about a lion. \"Something had happened to the mama lion's cubs,\" Kathy said. \"They were hurt.\"\n\n\"Where's my baby?\" Jessica asked, once her breathing tubes were removed. A nurse told her she'd been in an accident. \"Like a car accident?\" she asked. The nurse didn't answer.\n\nJessica's recovery was so swift that people at the hospital called her the \"miracle child.\" Although her skull had been fractured, neither bullet had penetrated it. Less than a week after Jessica emerged from her coma, DeMarco and another G.B.I. agent, Jared Coleman, interviewed her as she lay in her hospital bed. It was the first time anyone had spoken with her at length about the night of her injury. \"Cases like this-we don't usually have someone to talk to like you, because you're not here,\" Coleman told her.\n\n\"Right,\" she said, nearly whispering. Her voice was hoarse from the breathing tubes, and she seemed childlike and dazed, as if her only goal was to accommodate the agents as quickly as she could. She said that all she could remember about that night was that she'd gone to Walmart.\n\nThe G.B.I. agents asked if she had ever handled Matthew's gun.\n\n\"No, I can't even get it out of the case,\" she said. She wasn't sure how to unlock the safety lever on the holster. \"He asked me to go get it out before, and I told him, 'You're going to have to.' \"\n\n\"Have you ever had any thoughts about hurting yourself?\" Coleman asked.\n\n\"No. Never,\" she said. \"Especially because of my children.\" She started crying. \"I've never, ever wanted to hurt myself before.\"\n\n\"Do you think Matthew was ­incapable of doing this?\"\n\n\"Honestly, I don't know,\" she said. \"That's something that y'all would have to figure out.\"\n\nThe G.B.I.'s theory of Jessica's shooting depended on her being suicidal, but she gave no indication of being depressed. Although the hospital had placed her under constant observation after she was admitted, the precautions were removed after she regained consciousness. Had she attempted suicide, it would have been standard for the hospital to provide psychiatric care. But a psychiatrist who assessed her for depression apparently saw no need to give her a diagnosis or refer her for treatment. A second psychiatrist thought she had \"appropriate mood and affect; appropriate judgment and insight.\" Her surgeon, Henderson, wrote that she was \"a very positive person who is embracing the opportunities that a new lease on life afforded her by her recent recovery.\" He went on, \"She has a sense of humor and has a gentle and calm personality. She speaks lovingly of her children and the need to and desire to see them.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nAfter Jessica had been in the hospital for a month, her doctors tried to transfer her to a rehabilitation program, but she didn't have insurance, so she was discharged to the care of her grandparents. She walked with a limp and struggled with headaches, short-term memory lapses, ringing in her ears, and numbness on the left side of her body. Three days after she left the hospital, a deputy from the Pike County sheriff's office delivered a Family Violence Protective Order. Jessica could not come within three hundred yards of Matthew or her children. According to the order, which Matthew had petitioned the court to issue, \"probable cause exists that Family Violence has occurred in the past and may occur in the future.\" Jessica was ordered to have a psychological evaluation.\n\nAt a family-court hearing that June, Matthew asked that the protective order be extended for a year. Matthew, who had been restored to patrol duty, carried a new service gun and wore his uniform, and was accompanied by Beam. \"We have an individual that is a parent that attempted to take her own life,\" his lawyer, Lance Owen, told the judge. \"Somebody that shoots themself in the head means business. And if she's capable of attempting to take her own life, there's a chance that she might do something to these children.\"\n\nMatthew testified that Jessica's grandparents were \"not blood-related,\" and could not be trusted with the children. \"The fact that they don't believe that she did this to herself-I think they're not taking it seriously,\" Owen said.\n\n\"Have you spoken to her doctors about what they believe is the cause of her head injuries?\" Jessica's lawyer, Bree Lowry, asked. Henderson, the surgeon, had written Lowry a letter stating that \"whatever investigation there was done into this event in no way reflected our observations in the emergency room.\"\n\n\"I'm only concerned with the G.B.I. reports,\" Matthew said.\n\nLowry wanted to put witnesses on the stand who would testify that Matthew had been psychologically abu­sive. \"We believe he is a danger to her,\" she told the judge, Tommy Hankinson. \"One witness\"-Jessica's neighbor Megan Browning-\"would like to speak to you anonymously in chambers, because she is afraid.\"\n\nJudge Hankinson seemed to find the idea so novel as to be humorous. \"I don't think I've ever had that one before,\" he said. \"Is she gonna wear a mask or-\"\n\n\"I think we've got the right to confront and cross-examine anybody that's gonna be offering testimony,\" Owen said.\n\n\"Good for you, Mr. Owen,\" Hankinson replied. \"I'm glad to know there's still advocacy in the practice in the courts of the Griffin Judicial Circuit.\" No one ended up testifying about Jessica and Matthew's marriage.\n\nIn the past thirty years, the criminal-justice system has become more responsive to domestic violence, but family courts have been largely insulated from this cultural change. In an analysis of more than two thousand family-court opinions from the past decade, Joan S. Meier, a professor at George Washington University Law School, found that, in sixty-four per cent of cases, courts did not accept the story of a mother who said she or her children had been abused by her husband, even when evidence corroborated the claim. \"There is an unwillingness to believe, as if it's just preferable not to know this about our culture,\" Meier told me. She has found that courts are rarely willing to hear evidence about a form of abuse called \"coercive control\"-a crime in England-which describes the process by which people are dominated, sometimes to the point that they are no longer free agents and cannot make decisions without a partner's permission. \"The idea that domestic violence is bad for kids still has not sunk in-it sometimes barely makes a dent in a case,\" she said. Few states mandate that custody evaluators have domestic-violence training; judges often characterize the allegations as mudslinging and focus not on their veracity but on which party appears to be the better parent. \"The judges are very swayed by their own reactions to each person,\" Meier said. She found that, when a mother accused a father of domestic abuse or child abuse, she lost custody to the father in twenty-­eight per cent of cases. When the roles were reversed, fathers lost custody in only twelve per cent of cases.\n\nHankinson briefly paused during the hearing to see if any statutes said that attempted suicide was a form of child endangerment. He didn't find any, and dismissed the protective order. But he granted full custody to Matthew. Jessica could see her children for only four hours on Sunday afternoons. Owen proposed that Beam supervise the visits. \"Sheriff Beam can carry a weapon,\" he said. \"I don't know what she is capable of, Judge.\"\n\nJessica's family agreed to pay a hundred dollars every Sunday so that her visits could be observed by another armed law-enforcement agent. At the judge's recommendation, they also arranged for a psychological evaluation. Jessica's only diagnosis was \"acute stress disorder,\" which, the evaluator wrote, occurs \"when an individual is exposed to actual or threatened death.\" The evaluator added that her \"symptoms are normal and to be expected through circumstances such as hers.\"\n\nTwo months later, Jessica was hired as an assistant teacher at a child-care center in Griffin. Ashley Dunn, the lead teacher in Jessica's classroom, said, \"We were all, like, 'You can do an awesome job working with ten two-year-olds but you can't see your own kids?' \" On weekends, Dunn sometimes asked Jessica to babysit for her own children.\n\nIn September, 2016, the G.B.I. closed its case, concluding that Jessica's wounds were self-inflicted. Her DNA had been found on the gun, which was to be expected-she had been lying on it. Neither Matthew nor Jessica had been given a gunpowder-residue test. The agency deferred to its chief medical examiner, who spent ninety minutes on the case and never examined Jessica. He concluded that Jessica had shot herself in the head, though he indicated that his assessment would have been more definitive had there been a photo of Jessica's wound before she'd had surgery. The G.B.I.'s report never mentioned the picture of Jessica's bruise that Kathy had given the agents.\n\nThe agents who wrote the report seemed indifferent to the dynamics of Jessica and Matthew's marriage, as if the subject were a private matter that didn't merit discussion in an official investigation. They recorded interviews with eight Griffin police officers, some of whom Matthew considered good friends; one informed the agents that Matthew \"was telling me how she kind of acts crazy sometimes when she don't get her way.\" The G.B.I. did not record any interviews with Jessica's family or friends.\n\nAlthough police departments have become more attentive to officers' use of excessive force against civilians, the same scrutiny has not been applied to their potential for violent behavior at home. In the nineteen-nineties, researchers found that forty-one per cent of male officers admitted that, in the previous year, they'd been physically aggressive toward their spouses, and nearly ten per cent acknowledged choking, strangling, or using-or threatening to use-a knife or a gun. But there are almost no empirical studies examining the prevalence of this sort of abuse today. Leigh Goodmark, the director of the Gender Violence Clinic, at the University of Maryland's Carey School of Law, speculates that one reason for the dearth of research is a reluctance to fund a study that will bring attention to an uncomfortable dilemma: that, as Goodmark says, \"those policing the crime and those committing it are often the same person.\"\n\nAt the Griffin Police Department, concerns about domestic violence have apparently been so slight that in 2018 the department hired an officer whose personnel record showed that he had recently been accused by his child's mother of threatening her with a gun. In many other cities, domestic violence seems to be treated as similarly insignificant. This year, an independent panel found that the typical penalty for New York City police officers found guilty of domestic violence-some had punched, kicked, choked, or threatened their victims with guns-was thirty lost vacation days . In nearly a third of cases, the officers already had a domestic-violence incident-and, in one case, eight-in their records. In the Puerto Rico Police Department, ninety-­eight police officers were arrested for domestic violence between 2007 and 2010; three of them had shot and killed their wives. Only eight were fired.\n\nLast summer, the sheriff of Los Angeles County, Alex Villanueva, articulated a common justification for not con­sidering domestic violence as a concern: in defending his decision to employ a deputy who had been accused of stalking and physically abusing his ex-girlfriend, he told a local reporter that it was \"a private relationship between two consenting adults that went bad.\" The violence was seen as unrelated to job performance, an activity that could be understood only within the context of a relationship.\n\nBut the factors that lead to abuse at home-coercion, authoritarianism, a sense of entitlement to violence-are also present in the work that police officers do on the streets. It should not be surprising that domestic abuse appears to predict excessive use of force-a link that scholars have suggested should alter the way that departments respond to both kinds of aggression. The Citizens Police Data Project , in Chicago, analyzed the records of Chicago cops between 2000 and 2016 and found that officers accused of domestic abuse received fifty per cent more complaints than their colleagues for using excessive force. Philip Stinson , a professor of criminal justice at Bowling Green State University and one of the few scholars who has studied the issue, reached a similar finding: one in five officers arrested for domestic violence nationwide had also been the subject of a federal lawsuit for violating people's civil rights.\n\nThe Griffin Police Department had not received any complaints about Matthew's use of force, but Darrell Dix, a former lieutenant, told me that he and some of his colleagues worried that Matthew had a domineering and \"one-­dimensional\" approach to his work, which could provoke \"fights and scuffles.\" \"He had not learned that there is a human side of this, too,\" Dix said. \"It was 'I'm going to lock people up. I'm going to do it my way.' \"\n\nJessica's shooting was the subject of hushed conversations among Wendell Beam's staff at the Spalding County sheriff's office. \"In all my years in law enforcement, when someone shoots himself in the head it's one and done,\" Jessica Whitehouse, a deputy there at the time, told me. There's no second shot. \"Everyone said, 'Beam's grandson will get off,' \" she went on. \" 'Nothing will happen to the kid.' \"\n\nBefore being elected sheriff, in 2011, Beam had worked in the sheriff's office for thirty-seven years. He had a reputation for being kind and personable but also passive, indecisive, and resistant to change. When female officers told him that they were afraid of the patrol-division captain, David Gibson, whom Beam had promoted, he did nothing. Gibson routinely said to female colleagues, \"Shut your cock garage.\" He told a secretary that she should wear a cowbell around her neck, so he'd always know where she was.\n\nGibson had worked in the sheriff's office for twenty-eight years, and he cultivated an aura of invincibility. He claimed to have personally insured Beam's election. He spoke about how he gambled with a mythical figure known in the sheriff's office as the Wood Chipper, because, supposedly, he had used such a device to kill a woman. A deputy named Misty Piper said that, after Gibson repeatedly pressured her to have sex with him, she acquiesced, because she felt that, if she defied Gibson, she would meet a similar fate. Twice, she later testified, Gibson choked her. In 2012, Piper complained to Beam, and he said he'd look into the accusations, if she put them in writing. \"And then I started thinking, Well, why did I even come to you?\" she said. \"I'm not well connected with anyone.\" She decided to resign instead.\n\nThe following year, Gibson put a female colleague in a headlock and held a Taser against her temple. \"Get off of me!\" she screamed. A male sergeant saw the exchange and told Beam, who provided Gibson with what he called \"undocumented counselling.\" Two years later, Gibson slapped a secretary on the back of the head, telling a male officer, \"I'm gonna show you how we take care of these secretaries.\" Although the secretary complained to Beam about Gibson's behavior, Gibson was never disciplined.\n\nIn late 2014, Whitehouse, one of the youngest deputies in the sheriff's office, scheduled a meeting with Beam to say that Gibson's treatment of female cops was demeaning. She told me that, for female officers in many parts of the South, \"there's no in-between-you can't just be a human in uniform.\" They were made to feel that their presence contaminated the ethos of the department. \"If you perceive yourself as being country and rough, then you're a dyke,\" she said. \"If you do wear makeup and fix your hair, you're a whore.\"\n\nBeam asked Whitehouse to meet him at a park on the outskirts of Griffin. Whitehouse didn't understand why she was being directed to \"basically a hiding spot.\" She recorded the conversation on her phone, so that investigators could look for clues if she disappeared. \"He had control of Spalding County,\" she said, referring to Gibson. \"He was Spalding County. Anybody that went against him would be eliminated.\" Whitehouse said that Beam seemed concerned, but he said that she'd have to write down her complaint. Like Piper, Whitehouse was afraid to follow through. Beam dropped the matter. \"I figured she was going to retract her statement,\" he said later. (Beam refused to talk to me.)\n\nAfter several months, a male officer told a captain in Internal Affairs that he didn't understand why Whitehouse's complaint had been ignored. At the recommendation of the captain, and with Beam's approval, an outside agency investigated Gibson and concluded that he was a \"predator.\" In the spring of 2015, Beam allowed Gibson to retire, keeping his pension. The secretary whom he'd slapped in the head was asked to type his resignation letter. \"It was like he was spitting in my face,\" she said. (Through his lawyer, Gibson told me that the headlock-and-Taser incident was \"all in good fun\"; most of the other allegations were \"untrue and are otherwise embellished.\")\n\nAfter Gibson left, citizens came forward to say that they, too, were terrified of him. One woman said that he would drive to her house and shine the lights of his patrol car into her windows. Then he would \"handcuff me and put me on the hood of his patrol car and have oral sex with me,\" she wrote in a statement. \"I was going to report this, but, like he said, who will they believe?\" Another woman, who used methamphetamine, said that sometimes Gibson followed her as she drove. He would flash his lights and pull her over, and force her to have sex with him. She was sure that if she didn't comply he would arrest her.\n\nAs it became clear that Gibson's activities could be criminal, the G.B.I. looked into the allegations. In an audio-recorded conversation, an agent expressed disbelief that Beam had let Gibson's behavior continue for so long. \"Why is he getting so much protection and coverage?\" the agent said. \"This blows my mind.\"\n\nIn December, 2016, Jessica filed a report with the Griffin Police Department, saying that Matthew hadn't returned her belongings. After she came out of her coma, Denise had had to buy her new clothes. Jessica was still missing her orthodontic retainer. Matthew signed a sworn statement promising that he no longer had anything of Jessica's.\n\nMatthew was now dating Shelby Willey, a young mother who had recently separated from her husband. They moved in together in January, 2017, and as they were packing Willey discovered that Matthew had a large gym bag full of women's clothes, along with a retainer with \"Jessica\" printed on its case. When Willey asked Matthew about it, she said, he told her he intended to burn the bag, which Jessica had packed one night when she was planning to leave him. Willey had seen a copy of Matthew's sworn statement in his car, and she was disturbed that he was \"lying straight to everybody's face,\" she later told the police. (She and Callaway, Matthew's ex-girlfriend, couldn't be reached for this story.)\n\nIn a private Facebook message, Willey complained to a friend that Matthew's demeanor was \"emotionless but very authoritative.\" She had learned about Jessica's shooting after probing stories were published by Sheila Mathews in The Grip , a free newspaper in Spalding County, and aired on the Atlanta television station 11Alive, reported by Brendan Keefe. When she asked Matthew about the shooting, \"nothing adds up,\" she wrote to another friend on Facebook. \"It's always different. It's always more exaggerated every time.\" She felt uncomfortable that Matthew told Beam \"every detail of his life,\" but that the conversations \"were all confidential.\"\n\nIn May, 2017, they broke up. Willey contacted Jessica on Facebook and warned her that Matthew was not taking good care of the children; they were subsisting, she said, on cheese puffs, Fudge Rounds, corn dogs, and Mountain Dew, and sleeping at odd hours. \"It breaks my heart!\" she wrote. \"I'll go ahead and tell you that the boys deserve more structure and more care and love which I'm almost positive YOU have.\" By then, the boys were spending half their time with each parent, switching houses on Fridays.\n\nWilley wanted to help Jessica because she was scared of Matthew, too. \"It felt like he was just a ticking time bomb,\" she told the police. \"He never let me go anywhere without me sharing my location with him.\" She said that, when they talked about what happened to Jessica, \"he laughs about it. He thinks it's funny. And he said, 'It's a damn shame she didn't do it right the first time.' \" She added, \"He doesn't refer to her as, like, human. Like, he talks about her as if she's nothing.\"\n\nAs Willey was moving out of Matthew's house, she again came across the gym bag of Jessica's clothes. She notified a local truck driver named Will San­ders, who had a reputation as a ­freelance investigator. Sanders was forty-three years old and the son of a former Republican state representative; he considered himself a happy beneficiary of the \"good-old-boys system,\" he told me, and did not do his work in pursuit of po­litical reform. \"It's just a hobby,\" he said. \"It in­terests me on a psychological level.\" He had conducted his own canvass of Jessica's apartment complex; retraced Matthew's journey to the Waffle House, timing the drive with a stopwatch; and got permission from the new tenants of Jessica and Matthew's apartment to inspect the holes in the closet. He had filed nearly a hundred Open Records Act requests about Jessica's shooting, and he shared what he learned with Jessica's family, as well as with The Grip . Jessica's grandmother, Martha, said that initially she had trusted Wendell Beam, whom her husband had known for years, and the G.B.I.'s investigative process. \"I've always been such a firm believer in our just­ice system,\" she said. \"I would fight you tooth and nail defending it.\" But, af­ter receiving thousands of documents from Sanders, Martha stopped driving through Griffin, because she was afraid. Sanders said, \"I think the city thought this would be business as usual, until a local reporter and a loser truck driver got involved.\"\n\nSanders offered Willey a hundred and twenty dollars to sneak into Matthew's utility closet and get Jessica's bag. She agreed, and in May, 2017, Sanders dropped off the bag at the Griffin Police Department.\n\nMatthew was called in for questioning. At first he lied, but within fifteen minutes he acknowledged that he'd known about Jessica's bag all along. \"Why did you write the damn statement?\" a sergeant asked him. \"You know you can't give a sworn statement and lie on it.\" Crying, Matthew set his body armor, badge, and police radio on the table in front of him, and agreed to resign from the department.\n\nIn July, he was charged with two felonies: making false statements and violating his oath of office. Philip Stinson, the professor at Bowling Green, maintains a database of officers who have been arrested around the country, and he said that, in response to the Lautenberg Amendment, a federal provision that was passed in 1996 and prohibits people convicted of domestic violence from owning firearms, cops accused of domestic violence are often charged with lesser offenses, as a kind of \"professional courtesy,\" so they can continue working. \"That's the game here,\" he said. Jessica found it darkly funny that it was a missing retainer, and not her brain injury, that ultimately led to Matthew's arrest.\n\nMike Yates, the chief of the Griffin police, told me in an e-mail that Matthew's case had nothing to do with domestic violence. \"We will not be swayed by hearsay, false rhetoric or sensationalism in a manner that would cause harm to the innocent,\" he wrote.\n\nIn April, 2018, nine months after Matthew was charged, Jessica called the Spalding County district attorney's office to ask why Matthew's case hadn't been presented to a grand jury. She was told that, to prove that a crime had been committed, the district attorney needed to establish that the oath of office had been administered to Matthew. But a Griffin city official said that the document couldn't be found. Mathews, the publisher of The Grip and its only reporter, submitted an Open Records Act request to the magistrate's court, where judges swear in new officers. Within three hours, she received a copy of Matthew's official oath, which the D.A.'s office had been trying to find for six months. The next day, Yates texted the D.A. to say that he had the original document.\n\nMatthew's case was presented to a grand jury in July, 2018. Under Georgia law, police officers, unlike civilians, have the right to make a prepared statement at the end of a grand-jury hearing. There is no public record of the proceeding, but the grand jury chose not to indict Matthew either for making false statements or for violating his oath. Four months later, he was hired as a reserve officer in Braswell, Georgia, a community of four hundred people.\n\nJessica's grandparents wrote letters to the G.B.I., the governor, the city manager, and the district attorney to request that the investigation into Jessica's shooting be reopened. By then, Beam's reputation had been muddied by the Gibson investigation, and he had been voted out of office. Jessica's grandparents hoped that this development would help their case. The new sheriff, Darrell Dix, the former lieutenant in the Griffin Police Department, told me that when he unlocked the doors to the sheriff's office on his first day on the job, January 1, 2017, he found nine industrial-sized trash bags full of shredded papers. Jail trusties-model inmates who did menial jobs at the sheriff's office-told him that they'd spent two weeks destroying paperwork, at the previous administration's instruction. \"They had wiped stuff off the computers,\" Dix said. \"They had even taken notebooks off shelves and shredded the documents.\"\n\nDix was one of the Griffin police officers present the night that Jessica was shot. \"I don't doubt the findings of the G.B.I.,\" he told me. But, he said, \"there are a lot of questions out there-both in favor of Jessica and in favor of Matthew-that could be answered, but I just don't think the G.B.I. is going to do it.\" He believes that \"the only two people who know the answers are Jessica and Matthew,\" and Jessica will never be a reliable source, given her traumatic brain injury, and Matthew's account can't be trusted. \"I guarantee you he won't a hundred per cent say what happened,\" he said. (Matthew's lawyer said, in an e-mail, \"The ultimate aim of both the GBI's investigation and the grand jury's inquiry was to find the truth. And in both instances, he was cleared of wrongdoing.\")\n\nThat Matthew had found himself in a troubled relationship did not surprise Dix. \"Bad decisions,\" he said. \"Hardheaded. Wouldn't listen to anybody.\"\n\nNo one responded to Martha's letters. She concluded that she'd chosen the wrong tactic. \"At the time, I was well known in my field by people who had some clout\"-she worked in hospital risk management and had friends in law enforcement-\"and what we should have done is pulled some strings,\" she said. She felt she needed men in power on her side if she were to challenge a culture in which men let other men get away with what they please.\n\nWill Sanders, the truck driver, reached a similar conclusion. In July, 2018, he criticized Yates on the department's Facebook page for denying Sheila Mathews, The Grip's publisher, access to public information-behavior that, Sanders said, was part of a pattern of intimidating female reporters. Yates had lost his previous job, in 2014, as chief of the police department in Jonesboro, Arkansas, after he called a local reporter \"smelly\" and said that dealing with her was \"like trying to pick up a dog turd by the 'clean end.' \" She resigned, citing the \"level of stress and anxiety created by a public official who commands a small army.\"\n\nWithin two hours of Sanders's Facebook comment, Yates informed San­ders that his private Facebook messages would be made accessible to \"any persons interested in the entire scope of your actions, activities, motives and history.\" He added, \"This material will be released in the interest of transparency and context.\" The department had obtained the messages a year earlier, as part of the investigation into Jessica's gym bag. (The purposes of such a sweeping request were never clear. To obtain the search warrant, a lieutenant submitted a sworn statement explaining that there was probable cause that Sanders had been involved in two commercial burglaries; later, the lieutenant said that this was the result of a cut-and-paste error.)\n\nSanders deleted his Facebook account, his primary method of communicating with sources and reporting his findings. He had once assumed that if he dug deeply enough he would understand not only Jessica's shooting but the reasons that David Gibson had been protected for so long. Although Gibson had been indicted on fourteen charges, he was allowed to plead guilty, in June, 2017, to only two, for violating his oath of office, and he was granted first-offender status. After he serves a three-year sentence and finishes his probation, his record will be wiped clean.\n\nLink copied\n\nFor a time, Sanders thought that the source of Gibson's power might be connected to the Dixie Mafia (a gang based in the South), or a gambling ring, or some hidden knowledge that afforded him a lifetime of leverage over Beam. But now he resorted to a more mundane theory about the culture of power. \"My mama told me stories about going to lunch with my father and his friends in the sixties,\" he said to me. \"The men would sit down, and the women would stand behind their men. When the men wanted tea, they just shook their glasses.\"\n\nEven Gibson's lawyer, Phil Friduss, seemed at a loss to explain whether Gibson had controlled the county, as so many people believed. \"I hope those stories went too far,\" he said, referring to the notorious Wood Chipper. The inability to pinpoint the source of Gibson's dominance-and of Beam's capacity to shield other men-seemed only to feed the drama and paranoia. Eleanor Attwood, a lawyer representing six women who filed civil suits against Gibson, warned me to do all my reporting when the sun was out.\n\nSanders said that he no longer goes anywhere unarmed. If he has to drive to downtown Griffin, he cleans and vacuums his car, so he can easily see if someone plants drugs or contraband. For a while, he put clear tape on the doors of his house and car, so he would know if anyone had sneaked inside. Jessica gave him her old cell phone and notebook, and he keeps them in a safe at a location that he won't disclose, along with a shrink-wrapped box containing all the documents he collected. \"My dream is that, one day, the Feds show up and say, 'We want the notebook,' \" he said. But otherwise, he said, \"I'm done-I'm out. They have won. I hold up the white flag.\"\n\nJessica's older son often cried and clung to her when Matthew picked him up on Fridays, and in the summer of 2018 he complained that his father had hurt him. Jessica reported what he said to child-protective services, who helped arrange for the boys to see a child psychologist. The psychologist wrote, of the older son, \"I asked him if he has been happy or sad. He said, 'Sad.' When asked, how come, he stated, 'because daddy scares me.' \" He went on to say, \"Daddy was up the hill and hurt me in his house.\"\n\nThe sheriff's department in Pike County, where Matthew was living, investigated whether there had been abuse, but Matthew denied the allegation and the department did not find any concrete evidence. During the investigation, Jessica's sons were permitted to stay with her full time. In the spring of 2019, child-protective services closed the case and recommended, based on reports submitted by the children's psychologist, who had seen the boys for twenty-five sessions, that they no longer spend time with Matthew. \"The boys expressed fear of having any potential contact with their biological father,\" the psychologist wrote. Matthew is challenging the ruling in court. Jessica told me, \"I'd probably go to jail before I'd put the boys back in a situation where Matthew could even think about doing anything to them.\"\n\nShe now lives two hours north of Griffin, with her fiancé, Jacob Boyack, a high-school classmate, in a small yellow house with black shutters and an American flag hanging from the front porch. Jessica and Jacob have a son together, and their living room and kitchen are arranged like a nursery school, with a poster displaying the ABCs, a whiteboard, and wooden coat hangers shaped like trucks. Jessica is placid and effortlessly polite, warm without being intimate. When I visited them in August, Jacob mentioned that one of the boys had recently done a spin in the living room and called it a \"pirouette.\" Jessica seemed more energized by the comment than by anything else we discussed.\n\nMartha was initially skeptical when Jessica got involved with another man who assumed the role of protector. Gradually, though, her concerns dissipated. Jacob is gentle and jovial, articulating emotions that Jessica herself struggles to name. She has a tendency to brush over painful experiences. When I asked about her mother, who lived nearby, she said, mildly, that she had tried to reconnect with her several times over the years, but her mother didn't seem interested. \"She's just a piece of shit,\" Jacob clarified.\n\nWhen I asked Jessica why she never left the house when she lived with Matthew, she explained, \"We lived in an apartment complex with a playground. So there was really no need for me to leave. There was a pool there, too.\"\n\n\"You find plenty of reasons to leave now-I know that,\" Jacob teased her. Occasionally, Jessica still reflexively asked Jacob for permission to do things like visit her grandparents or go to the store. \"I'm, like, 'You don't have to ask me,' \" he said. \" 'You are your own person. You do whatever you want to do.' \" The lead teacher at the day care where Jessica worked had also found her unnecessarily deferential. \"It was like she needed permission for everything,\" she said.\n\nJessica still has occasional migraines, weakness in her left foot, and lingering amnesia about the night of her shooting. She could now recall that after she returned from Walmart she went to her closet to put her shoes on, because she needed to walk the dog. That is where her memory ends. She believes that she and Matthew must have fought in the closet, and she never made it outside. In the police body-cam videos, the dog is still wearing his leash.\n\nLike many docile, self-effacing women, Jessica has some hidden pockets of pride, and one of them is her skills as a writer. She's offended by the idea that she would have composed something as syntactically messy as the suicide text she is alleged to have written. \"There are too many useless words thrown in,\" she said. \"I would have written, 'I can't do this anymore comma .' \" She said she would have put a period after the line about taking care of the boys, rather than letting one sentence run into the next. \"I would have written 'suicidal thoughts,' not 'suicide thoughts.' \"\n\nShe told me that she couldn't imagine using a cliché such as \"I have not been able to recognize the person I see in the mirror.\"\n\n\"I don't generally even look in the mirror,\" she said. \"I mean, I walk past it. But I never look in it.\"\n\n\"I don't think the text was quite that literal,\" Jacob said.\n\n\"I would have picked something different,\" Jessica went on. \"A different metaphor.\" ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "The Cop\n\nDarren Wilson, the former police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown, an eighteen-year-old African-American, in Ferguson, Missouri, has been living for several months on a nondescript dead-end street on the outskirts of St. Louis. Most of the nearby houses are clad in vinyl siding; there are no sidewalks, and few cars around. Wilson, who is twenty-nine, started receiving death threats not long after the incident, in which Brown was killed in the street shortly after robbing a convenience store. Although Wilson recently bought the house, his name is not on the deed, and only a few friends know where he lives. He and his wife, Barb, who is thirty-seven, and also a former Ferguson cop, rarely linger in the front yard. Because of such precautions, Wilson has been leading a very quiet life. During the past year, a series of police killings of African-Americans across the country has inspired grief, outrage, protest, and acrimonious debate. For many Americans, this discussion, though painful, has been essential. Wilson has tried, with some success, to block it out.\n\nThis March, I spent several days at his home. The first time I pulled up to the curb, Wilson, who is six feet four and weighs two hundred and fifteen pounds, immediately stepped outside, wearing a hat and sunglasses. He had seen me arriving on security cameras that are synched to his phone.\n\nWilson has twice been exonerated of criminal wrongdoing. In November, after a grand jury chose not to indict him, the prosecutor, Robert P. McCulloch, was widely accused of having been soft on him, in part because McCulloch's father was a police officer who had been killed in a shootout with a black suspect. In March, the U.S. Department of Justice issued two official reports on Ferguson. One was a painstaking analysis of the shooting that weighed physical, ballistic, forensic, and crime-scene evidence, and statements from purported eyewitnesses. The report cleared Wilson of willfully violating Brown's civil rights, and concluded that his use of force was defensible. It also contradicted many details that the media had reported about the incident, including that Brown had raised his hands in surrender and had been shot in the back. The evidence supported Wilson's contention that Brown had been advancing toward him.\n\nThe Justice Department also released a broader assessment of the police and the courts in Ferguson, and it was scathing. The town, it concluded, was characterized by deep-seated racism. Local authorities targeted black residents, arresting them disproportionately and fining them excessively. Together, the two reports frustrated attempts to arrive at a clean moral conclusion. Wilson had violated no protocol in his deadly interaction with Brown, yet he was part of a corrupt and racist system.\n\nThe federal government's findings did little to soothe the raw emotions stirred by Brown's death. Many Americans believe that Wilson need not have killed Brown in order to protect himself, and might not have resorted to lethal force had Brown been white. Ta-Nehisi Coates, in his new book, \"Between the World and Me,\" writing of the psychological impact of incidents like the Brown shooting, says, \"It does not matter if the destruction is the result of an unfortunate overreaction. It does not matter if it originates in a misunderstanding.\" Coates also notes, \"There is nothing uniquely evil in these destroyers or even in this moment. The destroyers are merely men enforcing the whims of our country.\"\n\nMany police officers have defended Wilson, pointing out that cops patrolling violent neighborhoods risk their lives. Some right-wing publications have lionized him. In The American Thinker, David Whitley wrote that Wilson \"should be thanked and treated as a hero!\" Supporters raised nearly half a million dollars on behalf of the Wilsons, allowing them to move, buy the new house, and pay their legal expenses. But, as Wilson knows, such support has only deepened the resentment of people who feel that he deserves punishment or, at the very least, reprimand.\n\nDuring our conversations, Wilson typically sat in a recliner, holding his baby daughter, who was born in March. He said that, after Brown's death, people \"had made threats about doing something to my unborn child.\" Wilson, a former Boy Scout with round cheeks and blue eyes, speaks with a muted drawl. When Barb went to the hospital to give birth, he said, \"I made her check in anonymously.\"\n\nWilson said that he had interviewed for a few police positions but had been told that he would be a liability. \"It's too hot an issue, so it makes me unemployable,\" he said. He tried not to brood about it: \"I bottle everything up.\"\n\nThe baby has helped Wilson, who also has two stepsons, accept the constrictions of his current situation. It has also allowed him to maintain a pointed distance from the furor that the shooting helped to unleash. He told me that he had not read the Justice Department's report on the systemic racism in Ferguson. \"I don't have any desire,\" he said. \"I'm not going to keep living in the past about what Ferguson did. It's out of my control.\"\n\nWilson, who is from Texas, is the son of a woman who repeatedly broke the law. His mother, Tonya Dean, stole money, largely by writing hot checks. After completing high school, she married Wilson's father, John, who had been her English teacher. They soon had two children to support-Darren and his younger sister, Kara-but Dean spent wildly. She left John Wilson for another man, Tyler Harris, who ran a Y.M.C.A. They had a child, Jared, and Darren and Kara lived with them. \"Tonya had me in debt-almost twenty thousand dollars-that first year,\" Harris told me. Dean, it seems, often repaid debts to one person by stealing money from someone else.\n\nThe family eventually moved to St. Peters, west of St. Louis. When Wilson was thirteen, he stopped trusting his mother altogether, because she stole funds that she had helped raise for his Boy Scout troop. He worried that she would steal what little money he made working summer jobs, so he opened two bank accounts. The first, which had almost no money in it, was a decoy. He put his real earnings in the second, secret account. Wilson also tried to preëmpt his mother's stealing. Once, he warned a friend's parents not to let her inside their house, because she would surely find a way to steal their identities and max out their credit cards.\n\nDean was loving, Wilson said. \"She never wanted to hurt us.\" He added, \"But when it came to money she was going to get it, one way or another.\" Dean, who had been told by a psychiatrist that she was bipolar, began engaging in elaborate cons, at one point posing as an heiress poised to inherit millions of dollars.\n\nDespite her compulsive thievery, Dean somehow avoided prison. Finally, a judge warned her that if she appeared in his court again she would be jailed. Shortly afterward, in 2002, she died unexpectedly. At the time, Wilson didn't understand what had triggered her death, but he now thinks that it might have been suicide. (Harris suspects that she drank antifreeze.)\n\nAt the time, Wilson refused to talk about the tragedy, but his family knew that he was struggling: he started skipping school and hanging out with troublemakers. He graduated, though, and began doing construction work in the St. Louis area. He seemed directionless and unhappy. In 2008, the real-estate market crashed, and he could no longer find jobs. He applied to the Eastern Missouri Police Academy and was accepted. Being a police officer, he reasoned, was a recession-proof career.\n\nWilson found the classwork fascinating, especially when he and other cadets role-played at handling stressful situations. If they made a mistake, Wilson said, the instructors pounced: \"They're- bam! -in your face. Done. 'You're wrong.' 'It's over.' 'That person just died.' \" He welcomed the pressure.\n\nLink copied\n\nWilson's relatives had worried about how Dean's tumultuous life and death might affect her kids. Wilson's grandmother Susan Durso recalls asking herself, \"Are they going to be completely scarred?\" Darren Wilson, at least, had found a sense of purpose.\n\nWhen Wilson applied for a police job, he focussed on the northern portion of St. Louis County. The towns in what is called North County tend to be poorer, and to have a higher percentage of black residents, than other towns in the St. Louis area-such as St. Peters, the broadly middle-class, white town where Wilson grew up. North County also has more crime. Wilson felt that working in a tough area would propel his career. \"If you go there and you do three to five years, get your experience, you can kind of write your own ticket,\" he said.\n\nThere are almost fifty municipalities in North County. The officers in some of the towns are not just fighting crime; they also issue countless traffic tickets and ordinance-violation citations. The local governments often rely on the fines generated by tickets and violations to balance their budgets. (In 2013, the town of Edmundson, which comprises less than a square mile, issued nearly five thousand traffic tickets.) Police officers, meanwhile, can be paid as little as ten dollars an hour, according to Kevin Ahlbrand, the president of the Missouri Fraternal Order of Police. Ahlbrand says that the low pay can create \"unprofessional police officers,\" adding, \"You get what you pay for.\"\n\nIn 2009, Wilson got a job in Jennings, a town on Ferguson's southeastern border, where ninety per cent of the residents are black and a quarter of the population lives below the poverty line. \"I'd never been in an area where there was that much poverty,\" Wilson said. Interacting with residents, he felt intimidated and unprepared.\n\nA field-training officer named Mike McCarthy, who had been a cop for ten years, displayed no such discomfort. McCarthy, a thirty-nine-year-old Irish-American with short brown hair and a square chin, is a third-generation policeman who grew up in North County. Most of his childhood friends were African-American. \"If you just talk to him on the phone, you'd think you're talking to a black guy,\" Wilson said. \"He was able to relate to everyone up there.\"\n\nWilson said that he approached McCarthy for help: \"Mike, I don't know what I'm doing. This is a culture shock. Would you help me? Because you obviously have that connection, and you can relate to them. You may be white, but they still respect you. So why can they respect you and not me?\"\n\nMcCarthy had never heard another officer make such an honest admission of his own limitations. At the same time, he sensed a fierce determination: \"Darren was probably the best officer that I've ever trained-just by his willingness to learn.\"\n\nMcCarthy wasn't surprised that Wilson had difficulty interacting with residents. Police officers are rigorously trained in firing weapons and apprehending suspects but not in establishing common ground with people who have had different experiences. \"If you go to an academy, how much is on that?\" he asked me. \"Basically, nothing.\" A recent survey by the Police Executive Research Forum revealed that cadets usually receive fifty-eight hours of training in firearms, forty-nine in defensive tactics, ten in communication skills, and eight in de-escalation tactics.\n\nFor several months, McCarthy taught Wilson how to walk the beat-coaching him to loosen up, joke, and curse occasionally. He should avoid \"sounding like a Webster's Dictionary,\" never condescend, and never expect people to rat. At first, Wilson says, residents laughed at him, but he followed McCarthy's advice to \"just keep going.\" By the end of the training, Wilson said, he \"was more comfortable\" on the streets. McCarthy told me, \"There is so much distrust in the African-American community toward the police.\" The only way to overcome it was by establishing bonds with people. McCarthy, who is gay, said that he understood what it meant to be marginalized. \"In the United States, where everybody is supposed to be equal, I'm not. So that's a major thing.\"\n\nMcCarthy helped Wilson, in part, by letting him make mistakes. One night, they were patrolling a neighborhood where burglary was common. Wilson saw a car idling on the side of the street, and McCarthy didn't object when Wilson pulled over and asked the driver to show I.D. Wilson ran a check on the man's name; nothing came up, so he let him go. Later, McCarthy asked, \"What would've happened if you'd found a gun?\" Wilson said that he would have arrested the man. McCarthy asked him what his case for probable cause would have been, and Wilson couldn't answer. \"You'd be screwed,\" McCarthy said.\n\nMcCarthy had spent two years working as a police officer at a predominantly black middle school in the city of Normandy. (Michael Brown attended the school, but not when McCarthy worked there.) McCarthy told me that police officers he knew often disliked working in North County schools, because many students had an \"us versus them\" attitude. But he loved talking with the kids and \"investing in the community.\" He recalled, \"I would do the adopted-student program-take them to basketball games and things of that nature.\" Many of the kids confided in him about the stress of having to be \"man of the house\" when a parent worked nights. McCarthy said that his openness made the students more respectful: \"I wasn't the police to them, because they knew me on a personal level, rather than what that badge stood for.\" He said, \"People are amazing, and you have no idea what's going on behind that façade until you stop and try to know.\" Too many cops, he went on, weren't interested in understanding the \"root causes\" of crime; they preferred to \"go on calls, handle the call, and leave.\"\n\nWhen Wilson became a police officer in Jennings, he was joining a department that had a reputation for racism. Wesley Bell, a newly elected member of the Ferguson City Council, told me that he used to avoid driving through Jennings \"like the plague.\" This feeling endures. The current mayor of Jennings, Yolonda Henderson, who is black, told me that African-Americans in nearby towns \"still say, 'No, no, no, I ain't going over there.' \"\n\nWilson recalls hearing \"old-timers\" talk about racism in Jennings's past, but their stories didn't make a vivid impression on him. McCarthy, however, said that in the seventies and eighties the Jennings police \"did not play.\" He added, \"Basically, they'd beat you.\" During that period, many blacks from St. Louis moved to North County. Numerous towns there went from being majority white to being majority black. The police forces remained almost completely white.\n\nMcCarthy showed me several police logs from those decades, and many entries documented bigotry on the part of Jennings authorities. In April, 1973, a lieutenant described a holdup that had occurred near the police station. The suspects were two black males. At the bottom of the entry, someone had written, \"Men, you better leave your wallets at home. Niggers are going to come in the police station next and rob us.\" An entry from December, 1979, described an eighteen-year-old black male who was believed to have been involved in the shooting of a police officer but was then released, \"due to his lack of mental capacity.\" Below this, someone had scrawled, \"Kill the Fucker.\"\n\nMcCarthy said that police officers resist discussing racism, past or present. \"If an officer speaks out, they are ostracized,\" he said. \"They don't want anything negative to be out there. But we're humans-there's gonna be negative. Be honest about it. If you acknowledge it, that's the first step.\"\n\nWilson strongly disagreed with McCarthy about this. He granted that, in North County, the overt racism of past decades affected \"elders\" who lived through that time. \"People who experienced that, and were mistreated, have a legitimate claim,\" he told me. \"Other people don't.\" I asked him if he thought that young people in North County and elsewhere used this legacy as an excuse. \"I think so,\" he replied.\n\nLink copied\n\n\"I am really simple in the way that I look at life,\" Wilson said. \"What happened to my great-grandfather is not happening to me. I can't base my actions off what happened to him.\" Wilson said that police officers didn't have the luxury of dwelling on the past. \"We can't fix in thirty minutes what happened thirty years ago,\" he said. \"We have to fix what's happening now. That's my job as a police officer. I'm not going to delve into people's life-long history and figure out why they're feeling a certain way, in a certain moment.\" He added, \"I'm not a psychologist.\"\n\nWilson said that, despite what he'd said about experiencing \"culture shock,\" race hadn't affected the way he did police work: \"I never looked at it like 'I'm the only white guy here.' I just looked at it as 'This isn't where I grew up.' \" He said, \"When a cop shows up, it's, like, 'The cops are here!' There's no 'Oh, shit, the white cops are here!' \" He added, \"If you live in a high-crime area, with a lot of poverty, there's going to be a large police presence. You're going to piss people off. If police show up, it's because it's something bad, and whoever's involved can't figure out the problem for themselves.\"\n\nHe continued, \"Everyone is so quick to jump on race. It's not a race issue.\" There were two opposing views about policing, he said: \"There are people who feel that police have too much power, and they don't like it. There are people who feel police don't have enough power, and they don't like it.\"\n\nDuring Wilson's tenure in Jennings, an angry debate arose about how much power the police should have. In January, 2011, a white officer stopped a vehicle with expired license plates. The driver got out, but a black woman who had been riding in the passenger seat drove off. There was a child in the back seat. The officer shot at the car's tires. Though the car didn't crash, the child could have been seriously hurt. (The officer resigned.) Not long afterward, it was discovered that a lieutenant in Jennings had stolen federal funds allocated for drunk-driving checks. In March, 2011, the Jennings City Council voted to shut down the police department and hire St. Louis County to take over. McCarthy secured a job at the local jail, which the town still ran, but most of the other officers were laid off, including Wilson.\n\n\"When I left Jennings, I didn't want to work in a white area,\" Wilson told me. \"I liked the black community,\" he went on. \"I had fun there. . . . There's people who will just crack you up.\" He also liked the fact that there was more work for the police in a town like Jennings-more calls to answer, more people to meet. \"I didn't want to just sit around all day,\" he said.\n\nWilson, who had recently married a college student named Ashley Brown, didn't have to look far to find a new job. That October, he began policing in neighboring Ferguson, which was slightly more prosperous and about two-thirds black. He was mentored by another field-training officer: Barb Spradling, his future wife. Barb had been working in Ferguson for seven years, as one of three women on a force of roughly fifty officers. \"I always thought it was easier to work with guys, because they're not as catty,\" she said.\n\nThe training went smoothly. \"I made it easy on her, because all she really had to show me was the city limits and the paperwork,\" Wilson told me. \"I already knew the job.\" They began confiding in each other, and Wilson revealed that his marriage was foundering. Wilson also told Barb stories about his mother. Barb was moved, and before long they became a couple. \"I was, like, 'Wow, this guy has been through a lot,' \" she told me. \"And it seemed like he handled it all pretty gracefully.\"\n\nIn July, 2014, Wilson visited the home of Scottie Randolph, a sixty-seven-year-old African-American man, after Randolph reported hearing gunfire. Randolph says that shootings often occur in his neighborhood when \"the teen-agers are out of school.\" The frequency \"depends on whether they've got a drug war or a gang war going on.\" His neighborhood had fallen into disarray because of \"the economic meltdown.\" He added, \"A lot of people lost what little they had.\" Young people who couldn't find work resorted to selling drugs. Randolph told me that he needs the police for protection, but-echoing the Justice Department's findings-feels that they target blacks for fines: \"I kind of resent the fact that they're using minorities as a cash cow.\"\n\nWilson said that he often handled calls like Randolph's, and that such work was tough, because he could do little to help. I asked him if he agreed with Randolph that the neighborhood's main problem was the absence of jobs. \"There's a lack of jobs everywhere,\" he replied, brusquely. \"But there's also lack of initiative to get a job. You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink.\" He acknowledged that the jobs available in Ferguson often paid poorly, but added, \"That's how I started. You've got to start somewhere.\"\n\nGood values, Wilson insisted, needed to be learned at home. He spoke of a black single mother, in Ferguson, who was physically disabled and blind. She had several teen-age children, who \"ran wild,\" shooting guns, dealing drugs, and breaking into cars.\n\nSeveral times, Wilson recalled, he responded to calls about gunfire in the woman's neighborhood and saw \"people running either from or to that house.\" Wilson would give chase. \"It's midnight, and you're running through back yards.\" If he caught the kids, he checked them for weapons, then questioned them. He recounted a typical exchange: \" 'Why you running?' 'Because I'm afraid of getting caught.' 'Well, what are you afraid of getting caught for?' 'I don't know.' 'Well, there's a reason you ran, and there's a reason you don't want to get caught. What's going on?' \" Wilson said that he rarely got answers-and that any contraband had already been thrown away. Once, he arrested some of the woman's kids, for damaging property, but usually he let them go. In his telling, there was no reaching the blind woman's kids: \"They ran all over the mom. They didn't respect her, so why would they respect me?\" He added, \"They're so wrapped up in a different culture than-what I'm trying to say is, the right culture, the better one to pick from.\"\n\nThis sounded like racial code language. I pressed him: what did he mean by \"a different culture\"? Wilson struggled to respond. He said that he meant \"pre-gang culture, where you are just running in the streets-not worried about working in the morning, just worried about your immediate gratification.\" He added, \"It is the same younger culture that is everywhere in the inner cities.\"\n\nMost of Wilson's calls were routine-traffic stops, house alarms-but some were deeply distressing. At one crime scene, he discovered the mangled bodies of two dead women. A two-year-old, \"covered in blood,\" was crawling between them. I asked him if such incidents made it hard to sleep. \"No,\" he replied. \"I've never brought my work home.\" This was partly a matter of disposition, but Wilson noted that, while he and Barb were on the force, they lived twenty miles outside Ferguson. They needed \"that buffer\"-a \"chance to get out of that element.\"\n\nWilson's home life wasn't entirely peaceful, however. In May, 2013, Barb's ex-boyfriend John-the father of her younger son, who was then four-assaulted her, and also attacked Wilson. According to court papers, Barb said that John drank, and had beaten her in the past. (Barb asked me to omit John's surname, to protect her son's identity.) Barb testified in court that John \"pulled my hair,\" \"choked me,\" and \"punched me in the face.\" The Wilsons declined to discuss the incident with me.\n\nLink copied\n\nWilson says that he liked working in Ferguson, but after a year or so he discerned problems within the department. One day, he received a call about a woman screaming in the street. When he arrived on the scene, a rookie officer had already forced her onto the ground, arrested her, and handcuffed her. But the woman, the rookie had realized, hadn't deserved this treatment: she was having some kind of anxiety attack. \"Now what?\" he asked Wilson.\n\n\"You don't even know why you arrested somebody?\" Wilson said. Then he recalled who the rookie's field-training officer had been. Wilson summed up that officer's approach as \"Arrest them and figure it out later.\"\n\nWilson blamed the rookie's meagre training for his mistake. \"He didn't learn how to talk,\" Wilson said. There isn't much in the way of a reliable record about Wilson's own mode of communicating, except for a fifteen-second video that shows him arresting a twenty-nine-year-old white man named Michael Arman. That day, in October, 2013, Wilson was visiting Arman's house to deliver a court summons. Arman had several broken-down vehicles parked on his property, in violation of city rules. In his police report, Wilson says that Arman refused to take the summons, and so he arrested him for \"failure to comply.\"\n\nIn the video, Wilson approaches the front porch of the house and notices that he is being videotaped. \"If you want to take a picture of me one more time, I'm going to lock your ass up,\" he says, in an almost bored tone.\n\n\"Sir, I'm not taking a picture, I'm recording this incident,\" Arman says. \"Do I not have the right-\"\n\n\"No, you don't,\" Wilson says, inaccurately. The video ends. The encounter apparently did not escalate, but it is hardly a testament to Wilson's communication skills.\n\nArman was fined for his violation. According to NBC News, in 2013 Ferguson filed more than twelve thousand cases charging ordinance violations-everything from loitering to petty larceny. And there were more than eleven thousand cases charging traffic violations.\n\nThe Justice Department report on the city of Ferguson notes that police officers were punished when they didn't write enough tickets, and often issued multiple citations for a single stop. Wilson told me that he knew of an officer who had once issued sixteen. \"What the hell is the point?\" he asked me. He believed that such fines could create a \"vicious cycle,\" in which people could not pay what they owed, then were fined further for missing payments. \"That's almost abusive of power,\" he told me. I asked Wilson if he had issued multiple tickets. He said that he \"usually\" never wrote more than three.\n\nThree tickets, of course, could have ruinous consequences for a resident who was poor. I met a man from St. Louis named Sean Bailey, who had been stopped by the Ferguson police in 2005. He had parked his mother's car outside a Chinese restaurant, left a friend in the car, and run in to get take-out food. The police issued three violations, charging Bailey a hundred and two dollars for parking in a fire lane, and citing him for failure to register his car and driving without a valid license. Bailey, who was unemployed, couldn't afford to pay, and when he missed deadlines he was charged additional fines. He has since been arrested half a dozen times for having outstanding fines, and has spent three weeks in jail. He says that, cumulatively, he has paid hundreds of dollars, but the city says that he still owes another hundred and fifty-eight. He has little hope of paying the debt, because he and his four-year-old daughter are homeless.\n\nThough Ferguson police officers routinely arrested people for \"failure to comply,\" Wilson's arrest of Arman was unusual in one respect: Arman is white. The Justice Department report concludes that Ferguson's officers disproportionately charged black citizens with such violations. Wilson insists that he didn't perceive this bias. But the inequity was extreme: between 2011 and 2013, the Justice Department reported, ninety-four per cent of the people arrested in Ferguson for \"failure to comply\" were black. The Justice Department also reported that the Ferguson police routinely performed \"pedestrian checks,\" in which residents were stopped on the street, often without proper legal justification.\n\nIn police records, I found four well-documented instances in which Wilson was involved in \"ped checks.\" On February 27, 2014, he stopped a twenty-three-year-old black man named Aaron Simmons, outside a minimart. In the police report, Wilson remarks that the minimart was known as a place where drugs were sold. He also mentions that it was cold outside, and that while patrolling he had seen Simmons four times \"in this area.\" Wilson reports that, for his own safety, he told Simmons to remove his hands from his pockets. Simmons objected: it was freezing, and his pockets were empty. Wilson forcibly removed Simmons's \"hands from his pants, during which Simmons actively resisted my control.\" Wilson then requested Simmons to place his hands against the police car, so that he could be searched for weapons. When Simmons refused, Wilson arrested him for failure to comply. The report does not say that Simmons possessed anything illegal. During the arrest process, Wilson notes, he and Simmons had several physical confrontations, including one, at the police station, in which \"Simmons was pushed against the wall.\"\n\nI showed the four reports to Erin Murphy, an N.Y.U. law professor who studies Fourth Amendment issues. Murphy said that, in the case of Simmons, there was no legitimate reason for detaining him. The other ped checks were less dramatic, but also reflected \"questionable constitutional behavior.\" These reports, she noted, painted \"a familiar picture of contemporary law enforcement.\" Police officers, she added, are not entirely to blame-often, they are trying to \"enforce vague standards for detaining people that they don't really understand.\" (Wilson conceded that the failure-to-comply ordinance was exploited as an \"easy way to arrest someone.\" True violations, he said, involved more resistance than \"you telling someone to come here, and them saying, 'No, screw you.' \" But when I asked him to explain the ordinance further, he said, \"I'd have to read it again.\")\n\nThe Justice Department found other examples of systemic racial bias in Ferguson. From 2012 to 2014, the Ferguson police issued four or more tickets to blacks on seventy-three occasions, and to whites only twice. Black drivers were more than twice as likely as others to be searched during vehicle stops, even though they were found to possess contraband twenty-six per cent less often. Some charges, like \"manner of walking in roadway,\" were brought against blacks almost exclusively.\n\nWilson told me that Ferguson's force had a few bigoted members, but he denied that racism was institutional. The Justice Department's numbers were \"skewed,\" he said. \"You can make those numbers fit whatever agenda you want.\"\n\nWithin the city government, however, there appears to have been a disturbing level of cynicism about race and crime. In 2011, an e-mail circulated by police supervisors and court staff joked that a black woman who had an abortion was practicing good crime control. While Justice Department officials were investigating Ferguson, city officials repeatedly told them that the arrest statistics simply reflected the fact that black residents lacked \"personal responsibility.\" Indeed, before August 9, 2014-the day of Brown's death-there seems to have been almost no sense that the city needed to change. When I asked Wilson if he felt that Ferguson might boil over, he said, \"There's always going to be a little bit simmering in a high-crime, poverty area. In that area, police usually aren't coming over to have dinner.\"\n\nMark Byrne, who has been a councilman in Ferguson since 2010, told me that there were things he had missed: \"I didn't know, on August 9th, that we only had four African-American police officers on a force of fifty-three.\" In 2014, the city spent four times as much money on police uniforms as it did on police training. Byrne said, \"I could have done a better job.\"\n\nJust before noon on August 9, 2014, Darren Wilson was heading for a lunch date with Barb when his radio announced that there was a \"stealing in progress\" at the nearby Ferguson Market and Liquor. The dispatcher offered a description of the two suspects. Wilson radioed back: \"Do you guys need me?\" The dispatcher replied that the suspects had \"disappeared.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nWilson, who had just assisted a mother whose infant was having difficulty breathing, decided that if the robbery trail was cold he would continue on to lunch. Moments later, he encountered Michael Brown and his friend Dorian Johnson, walking down the middle of Canfield Drive.\n\nBrown was at a precarious juncture in his life. When he was twelve, his parents had split up. At first, he had lived with his mother, Lesley McSpadden, but by the age of sixteen he had moved in with his father, Michael Brown, Sr. \"He wasn't doing so good over there,\" Brown, Sr., told me. \"She was working-wasn't nobody there to kind of help him out-so he came back my way, and he was staying back and forth with me and my mother.\" Last summer, Brown was living with his maternal grandmother.\n\nBrown had struggled academically, and had switched schools several times. He was six feet five and weighed nearly three hundred pounds, and, because of his size, people often thought he was older than he was. Brown, Sr., recalls worrying that his son's physical stature might make him a target for the police. \"We had a conversation about just following orders,\" he said. \"After you thought that you were being disrespected, get a name and a badge number, so your parent can reach out to the police department and file a complaint.\" Most important was a simple directive: \"Obey.\"\n\nBrown had just graduated from Normandy High School, where he had participated in an alternative-education program. He was planning to study heating and cooling at a technical school, but hadn't yet started. Now summer was ending, and he had decisions to make.\n\nEach spring, Duane Foster, a music teacher at Normandy, who knew Brown in passing, tells his seniors, \"Since you've been a child, you have known every year, from August to June, that you're going to go to school. . . . For the first time in your life, you won't have anything set in stone. And that should make you scared.\"\n\nFor many of the students at Normandy, Foster said, attending college is not a possibility. At home, these students are often told that, once school ends, they must earn their keep. Some of these young people have very few options, he said, then asked, \"How do I compete with somebody struggling with poverty? How do I come into a classroom and say that you don't need to be selling drugs or participating in gang-like activity?\"\n\nFoster grew up near Ferguson, in Velda Village Hills. When his family moved there, in 1969, it was among the first black families in town. By the mid-seventies, the neighborhood was almost entirely black. Back then, there were jobs and two-parent families, and this created stability. \"We had General Motors, Chrysler, and Ford,\" he told me. \"So many factories.\" Those jobs are now gone, as are many fathers, he says.\n\nAccording to a recent analysis by the Times of American communities with at least ten thousand black residents, the city with the largest proportion of black men who are \"missing\"-in jail or prematurely dead-is Ferguson. Foster said, \"There's no real design for a middle class, or even a lower-middle class, in this area.\"\n\nMichael Brown's father played an active role in his life, but this isn't always the case for Normandy students. A third of Foster's students have a father in jail. Many of them believe, rightly or wrongly, that their father is innocent, and this inevitably shapes how young people in Ferguson view the police. This context, Foster says, helps provide a clearer picture of where Brown came from, and who his peers were.\n\nThe image of Brown that many people have was shaped by the surveillance video from Ferguson Market and Liquor. In that footage, we see Brown take several packages of cigarillos, then head toward the door. A clerk tries to stop him, but Brown easily shoves him aside. Store employees later told federal investigators that Brown looked \"crazy,\" used profane language, and asked the clerk, menacingly, \"What are you gonna do about it?\"\n\nDorian Johnson told me that, before entering the market, he and Brown \"never talked about stealing things.\" Johnson claimed that they were instead immersed in a discussion \"about the Bible and God-how you're supposed to be as a human going through life.\" After Brown stole the cigarillos and they left the store, they resumed this conversation. Johnson also claimed that he didn't even acknowledge that the theft had taken place, because he didn't want to rub Brown \"the wrong way.\" He told me, \"I was being a real good friend and staying with him, even though I know he committed a crime,\" and added, \"It wasn't like he robbed the store-like he held it at gunpoint or anything-so I didn't think the guy was really gonna call the police.\"\n\nThe most thorough account of what happened next comes from the Justice Department's report on the incident, which is eighty-six pages long.\n\nWilson was heading west on Canfield Drive, his window open, in his department-issued Chevrolet Tahoe. He spotted Brown and Johnson, and called out to them to use the sidewalk. According to Wilson, Brown replied, \"Fuck what you have to say.\" (Johnson denies that Brown said this, and claims that Wilson told them, \"Get the fuck on the sidewalk.\") Wilson surmised that Brown and Johnson were the robbery suspects, based on the descriptions offered on the radio and the cigarillos in Brown's hands. After calling for backup, Wilson parked his vehicle at an angle, barricading the roadway.\n\nAccording to Kevin Ahlbrand, the president of the Missouri Fraternal Order of Police, parking a police car in this manner is a common maneuver-a car in the street offers a cop protection in the event of a gunfight.\n\nJonathan Fenderson, who is a professor of African-American studies at Washington University, in St. Louis, told me that young black men are inclined to see the police as an \"occupying force.\" Intentionally or not, Wilson's decision to blockade the street sent a message: You will defer to the power that I exhibit, or I am going to force you back into place.\n\nAfter stopping his car, Wilson tried to open his door, but Brown blocked his way. It is impossible to know what Brown and Wilson then said to each other-or why the situation escalated so quickly. I asked Wilson repeatedly to discuss this moment with me, but he declined, noting that Brown's parents are pursuing a civil lawsuit, and that he didn't need details \"in print that they're going to try and spin.\"\n\nAccording to Wilson and several witnesses deemed credible by the Justice Department, Brown reached into the Tahoe's open window, grabbed Wilson, and punched him. This narrative, the report says, is supported by bruising on Wilson's jaw and samples of Brown's DNA found on Wilson's collar, shirt, and pants. It's not known why Brown did this, and many have speculated that Wilson provoked Brown somehow.\n\nAt this point, Wilson told investigators, his training kicked in and he reviewed his options. He did not carry a Taser, so the weapons at his disposal were mace, a retractable baton, and his gun. The only one readily accessible, Wilson said, was the gun. When he unholstered it, he told investigators, Brown reached for it. He told the grand jury that Brown said to him, \"You are too much of a pussy to shoot me.\" In the ensuing struggle, Wilson shot Brown in the hand. This sequence of events has factual support. Brown's DNA was detected on the inside of the driver's-side door, and soot from the gun's muzzle was found in Brown's wound, indicating that his hand was within inches of the weapon when it fired. It was the first time that Wilson had used his gun in the line of duty.\n\nLink copied\n\nWilson told the grand jury that Brown, upon being shot, had \"the most intense, aggressive face,\" and looked \"like a demon.\" Brown retreated, running east. Wilson chased him. Brown ran at least a hundred and eighty feet down Canfield Drive-his blood was found in the roadway-and then headed back toward Wilson. According to the Justice Department, eyewitnesses claiming that Brown raised his hands in surrender proved unreliable. (One of these witnesses, Dorian Johnson, continues to insist that Brown's hands were raised.) Witnesses deemed credible offered varying accounts of Brown's movement-\"charging,\" \"slow motion,\" \"running\"-but concurred that he was approaching Wilson. According to Wilson, he repeatedly ordered Brown to stop and get on the ground. Brown, who was unarmed, kept moving. At one point, Wilson told investigators, Brown put his right hand into his waistband, as if reaching for a weapon.\n\nSometime after the chase began, Wilson shot ten bullets at Brown. A few missed him, but he was hit in the chest, the forehead, and the arm. Autopsy reports indicate that, contrary to initial media reports, no bullets hit Brown in the back. It is possible that Wilson fired some of the errant bullets before Brown turned around, and the Justice Department report says that \"the autopsy results alone do not indicate the direction Brown was facing when he received two wounds to his right arm.\" Yet the report repeatedly underscores that eyewitness accounts describing Brown being shot from behind were unreliable.\n\nAcademics have studied whether cops exhibit racial bias when deciding whether to pull the trigger. Joshua Correll, at the University of Colorado Boulder, has done more than twenty studies on this topic. In 2000, Correll created a video game in which participants view images of armed and unarmed men-some black, some white. Participants must make rapid decisions about whether to shoot. Initially, Correll tested civilians-college students, mainly-and found that they were quicker to shoot black suspects than white suspects. They also were more likely to shoot unarmed suspects when those suspects were black. When Correll had police officers do the test, the results were more ambiguous. Officers, like civilians, were significantly quicker to shoot black suspects than white suspects; but cops showed no bias when shooting unarmed suspects by mistake. Correll believes that this is a result of the training that cops receive.\n\nWilson told the grand jury that when Brown was hit by the bullets he \"looked like he was almost bulking up to run through the shots, like it was making him mad that I'm shooting at him.\" This testimony has inspired much debate. In November, Melissa Harris-Perry, the commentator on MSNBC, noted that Wilson's use of language-much like his use of the word \"demon\"-was dehumanizing, and conformed to the \"myth of the black brute incapable of pain himself bent on inflicting pain on others.\" She added, \"Americans long have had difficulty in understanding, acknowledging, and having empathy for the pain of black men.\"\n\nBrown collapsed after being shot. At 12:05 p.m. , an ambulance-carrying the infant Wilson had assisted-came across the scene, and a paramedic pronounced Brown dead. The body remained on the hot asphalt for four hours. Hundreds of angry residents gathered, some shouting, \"Let's kill the police!\" Ferguson officials say that this volatility slowed down the processing of Brown's body, but the delay struck many onlookers as deeply insulting. As one local told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, \"You'll never make anyone black believe that a white kid would have laid in the street for four hours.\"\n\nSabrina Webb, one of Brown's cousins, lived on Canfield Drive, across from the scene of the shooting. She was at work when the shooting occurred. Her roommate called to report that someone had just been shot dead. Webb rushed home. She couldn't get down Canfield Drive in her car, so she parked on a nearby street and ran the rest of the way. She pushed through onlookers and discovered that the victim was her cousin. Brown was three years younger than she was, and they had seen each other the previous week. \"We were just happy,\" she says. \"Like normal kids.\" Now his dead body was lying on the street. \"That's going to always stay on my mind,\" she told me. \"Always. It's nothing you can get rid of.\"\n\nAt the Ferguson police station, Barb Wilson wondered why her husband hadn't showed up for lunch. Then, she told me, \"he just walked in and was, like, 'I just killed somebody.' \" Barb noticed that Wilson's \"face was flushed and red-it didn't look right.\" She decided that he needed space and, not knowing what else to do, took care of some paperwork. Wilson went to the hospital with his superiors, and debriefed them while he was examined for injuries. He returned to the station, and he and Barb headed home.\n\n\"Neither one of us knew what the reaction was going to be the next day,\" Wilson said. \"You know, a typical police shooting is: you get about a week to a week and a half off, you see a shrink, you go through your Internal Affairs interviews. And then you come back.\" Barb told me, \"I didn't think it would be a big weight on his shoulders. This is kind of what we signed up for.\"\n\nLater that night, however, they turned on the television and watched live coverage of unrest in Ferguson. Barb recalled, \"We stayed up all night watching, like, 'Oh, my God-what's going on? What are they doing?' \"\n\nBarb's younger son, who was then six, asked why there were images on television of Ferguson burning. Wilson told me, \"I said, 'Well, I had to shoot somebody.' And he goes, 'Well, why did you shoot him? Was he a bad guy?' I said, 'Yeah, he was a bad guy.' \"\n\nSoon after the shooting, Wilson called Mike McCarthy and gave him an account of what had happened. \"I never questioned it,\" McCarthy told me. Around the same time, he was involved in a shootout with an armed suspect, and he knew that such experiences were chaotic. McCarthy, who was moonlighting as a policeman in a North County town, answered a call about a domestic disturbance. He showed me a video of the incident.\n\nWhen McCarthy arrived on the scene, a black man in his twenties opened fire on him and another officer. The other cop was hit. The shooter sped off in his car. McCarthy got back into his car, letting out a strange, adrenaline-filled whoop. \"After I got shot at, I had one thing on my mind, and that was getting that son of a bitch,\" McCarthy told me. He pursued the shooter. \"Then it hit me-'I have to go back.' \" He returned to his colleague. Fortunately, the officer was unhurt; the bullet had been stopped by the Taser on his utility belt.\n\nMcCarthy's story made clear that even a seasoned veteran could forget protocol while under duress. He said of Wilson's troubles, \"It just tore me up, because here you had a young kid who was doing nothing more than his job-and was doing a job that I encouraged him and taught him how to do.\" McCarthy sympathized with some of the underlying rage that fuelled the protests-and the riots-but he was adamant that the shooting had nothing to do with race.\n\nA few days after the shooting, the Wilsons, worried that their address was about to be leaked online, fled to the house of a relative: \"We ran through the house, grabbed all our guns, and put some bags together.\" Wilson contemplated leaving St. Louis for good, then reconsidered. He told me, \"At least here I'd know where I'm welcome and not welcome.\"\n\nOn August 9th, as events unfolded in Ferguson, Rasheen Aldridge was working at an Alamo rental-car office at the St. Louis Airport. From the parking lot, he had a clear view of Interstate 70. \"I saw, like, forty police cars heading toward Ferguson,\" he recalled. On the Internet, he found an image of Brown's body in the street.\n\nAldridge, who was twenty at the time, had grown up in the impoverished Fifth Ward of St. Louis, but he was a homebody and spent little time on the streets. In kindergarten, Aldridge had entered the county's desegregation program, and attended school in an affluent suburb. Many of his friends were white and Jewish. His childhood was quite different from Michael Brown's, and perhaps for this reason he was drawn to Ferguson. On August 11th, he drove there with a friend.\n\nLink copied\n\nAldridge talked with residents, gathering firsthand accounts of what had happened. A few days later, he returned and watched, horrified, as looters ransacked a store. He and several others formed a raggedy line of defense. Some looters walked away, Aldridge says; others didn't. \"Some called us house niggers,\" he said, his voice cracking.\n\nIn subsequent weeks, Aldridge returned often to Ferguson, participating in protests that he hoped would peacefully bring change. Initially, he gave the police the benefit of the doubt. Then officers started firing tear gas into the crowds and, occasionally, calling protesters \"niggers.\"\n\nAldridge heard the media reports that Brown's hands had been raised and that Wilson had shot him in the back. It was Dorian Johnson who had first made these allegations, and they helped inspire the now famous rallying cry \"Hands Up, Don't Shoot.\" Although Johnson's story proved to be at odds with the Justice Department's findings, the narrative had taken hold-and, for many Americans, it has endured. In part, this is because Johnson's story was eminently plausible. Within the past year alone, the media has highlighted many examples of police brutality in which the facts strongly resemble the type of story that Johnson told-from the fatal choking of Eric Garner, on Staten Island, to the fatal shootings of Walter Scott, in North Charleston, South Carolina, and Samuel Dubose, in Cincinnati.\n\nAldridge told me that, based on what he had heard and read, he believed that Brown was in \"surrender mode\" when Wilson shot him. When we spoke, he admitted that he had not yet read the Justice Department's report on the shooting. It was hard not to notice a parallel: both Aldridge and Wilson had turned to the report that buttressed their own world view. It was as if the two Justice Department reports had come to present opposing realities.\n\nLegitimate questions linger about the shooting. If Brown was unprovoked, why did he reach into the police car and punch Wilson in the face? Why did Wilson fire ten shots? A young activist in Ferguson, Clifton Kinnie, said, \"The story doesn't make sense. Black youth don't fight police-we run.\"\n\nKinnie recounted a story of walking toward a park, with his younger brother. A police officer pulled up in his car and told them to get on the ground. Kinnie complied and told his brother to do the same. The officer was apparently searching for some suspects. Kinnie still recalls how aggressive the officer was, \"coming at us as if we were grown men.\" This was in 2005, when Kinnie was eight years old.\n\nKinnie's cynical view of the police was bolstered by the Justice Department's conclusions about the city of Ferguson. If the police generally acted in a racist and abusive manner, why give Wilson the benefit of the doubt?\n\nIn May, I posed this question to Brittany Ferrell and Alexis Templeton-a charismatic black couple who are two of the most visible activists in Ferguson. Templeton said that the two Justice Department reports \"pretty much contradict one another,\" adding, \"You have to say, Damn, if the Ferguson Police Department is racist, and Wilson works in the Ferguson Police Department, that means he might be racist, too.\" She said, \"They need to open up and relook at this case.\" Ferrell said, \"The system is going to do whatever it has to do to protect itself. And if that means protecting Darren Wilson, the officer who represents that system, they're going to do that.\"\n\nOne afternoon this spring, Ferrell and Templeton joined a protest in Ferguson. At the time, people were marching in Baltimore over the death of Freddie Gray, and the mood in Ferguson was tense. About a hundred protesters gathered outside a church, then proceeded onto the street. They chanted, \"Indict! Convict! Send that killer cop to jail! The whole damn system is guilty as hell!\"\n\nThe plan was to shut down the intersection of West Florissant and Chambers Road for four minutes, in symbolic homage to the four hours that Brown's body lay in the street. When the protesters reached the intersection, they marched in front of oncoming cars. Horns honked, and an irate motorist yelled, \"Get out of the street so people can get to work!\" One car drove onto the elevated median and made a reckless U-turn. Another driver tried to force his way through the protesters, at considerable speed, and nearly hit one of them.\n\nThe police never showed up. Several squad cars remained parked just down the street, in an empty lot. Some locals told me that the Ferguson police often decided not to engage these days. Weeks later, one white resident told me, bitterly, that the cops had their \"hands tied\" and couldn't police \"the way they should.\" On one occasion, he said, he called the police about a possible break-in at a neighbor's house, and an officer advised him to arm himself. Mike McCarthy also lamented the situation: \"I don't think the cops in Ferguson can do a whole lot of policing these days.\" The Justice Department's exposé may have had a constraining effect, but it's also true that the city's leadership is in flux. A week after the report came out, the police chief, the city manager, and the municipal judge all resigned. (The city recently named Andre Anderson, who is black, its interim police chief. His first goal, he announced, was \"simply to build trust.\")\n\nLate in the evening on April 28th, violence broke out in Ferguson, and a store was looted. That night, I met up with McCarthy, in Jennings. On his police scanner, there were multiple reports of gunshots. \"They are getting ready to switch over to Code 2000,\" McCarthy told me. \"A riot code.\" A voice on the scanner then announced, \"I have the air unit en route to your location.\"\n\nThe problems in Ferguson, McCarthy told me, were rooted in a vast historical legacy of injustice: \"No matter what we do, we cannot right our wrongs to the African-American community.\" But police had to do their job-and he, for one, couldn't see himself leaving North County. \"I don't think I'd be effective,\" he said. \"It's not what I know.\"\n\nI asked him if, by the same logic, a man with the background of Darren Wilson would be inherently less effective in North County. McCarthy bristled. \"Watch what you're using for the definition of 'effective,' \" he said. \"I can do my job down there, but you're not getting the maximum use of my resources.\" What would be lost? The ability to communicate easily, he replied.\n\nI reminded him that he considered communication to be the most important skill in law enforcement. Wasn't Wilson's confrontation with Brown, on some level, about communication? Would an encounter with Brown really have played out in the same manner for McCarthy?\n\nHe insisted that he would have acted just as Wilson had. I then asked him to consider the initial moment of contact, when Wilson and Brown were still talking. \"It might not have escalated to that point,\" McCarthy conceded, uneasily. Later, he added, \"There is likelihood that it could've avoided that confrontation-the escalation of that confrontation.\" But he felt that such speculation was pointless.\n\nLink copied\n\nReverend Starsky Wilson is the co-chair of the Ferguson Commission, whose members have been asked by Missouri's governor, Jay Nixon, to study what factors might have contributed to the rioting. In Reverend Wilson's view, the moment when Darren Wilson first spoke with Michael Brown was enormously consequential. \"It frames the engagement and it sets a tone for the relationship,\" he told me. But this moment couldn't be isolated from all the mistakes that came before it. In places like Ferguson, police officers needed to spend more time in the schools, getting to know disadvantaged students, and they had to treat more residents as allies. He urged me to consider what might have happened if Wilson had known Brown, or Brown's grandmother, and was able to say, \"Does Miss Jenny know you're out here?\" Such a question, Reverend Wilson said, has a more potent moral authority. One afternoon this spring, I accompanied Darren and Barb Wilson to a park near their house, where they watched Barb's younger son practice baseball. Darren wore shades and a baseball cap, and we stayed in the Wilsons' S.U.V.\n\nWilson says that, after the grand jury cleared him, he wanted to rejoin Ferguson's police force. But he was told that his presence would put other officers at risk. \"They put that on me,\" Wilson said. He worked for two weeks at a boot store, stocking inventory, but quit when reporters started calling the store. \"No matter what I do, they try to get a story off of it,\" he told me.\n\nAfter the shooting, Barb was reluctant to return to the streets of Ferguson, for fear of being identified as Wilson's wife. The department recently offered her a job as a dispatcher-with a substantial pay cut. Barb decided to retire early. In the car, she turned to Darren and said, \"I just want that lottery ticket we bought in Piedmont to be a winner.\"\n\nI asked Wilson what he would do if the Ferguson police force offered him his job back. He seemed startled. \"I would-um-\"\n\n\"I would not allow him,\" Barb said.\n\n\"I would want to do it for a day,\" Darren said, finally, to show people that he was not \"defeated.\"\n\nIn our many discussions, Wilson rarely spoke of Michael Brown. Twice, I asked him if he had reflected on what kind of person Brown was. The first time I asked, it was early May, and Brown's parents had just filed their civil lawsuit against him. \"You do realize that his parents are suing me?\" he said. \"So I have to think about him.\" He went on, \"Do I think about who he was as a person? Not really, because it doesn't matter at this point. Do I think he had the best upbringing? No. Not at all.\" His tone was striking, given Wilson's own turbulent childhood.\n\nSix weeks later, Wilson told me that he had never really had a chance to contemplate who Brown was, because he had been preoccupied by the maelstrom that followed the shooting. I asked him if he thought Brown was truly a \"bad guy,\" or just a kid who had got himself into a bad situation. \"I only knew him for those forty-five seconds in which he was trying to kill me, so I don't know,\" Wilson said.\n\nBarb also said that she rarely thought about Brown. But she thought about a woman named Stephanie Edwards, whom she knew well. Edwards was the mother of Louis Head, Brown's stepfather. Before becoming a cop, Barb had worked with Edwards at a grocery store. Barb says that they talked every day for roughly ten years, learning minute details of each other's lives, but they didn't keep in touch when Barb became a cop.\n\nAfter the shooting, Edwards joined the protests, appearing at a rally wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with Brown's face. \"We are tired of police brutality,\" she told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. \"I came out for justice.\" Barb wonders what would happen if she and Edwards crossed paths again. Barb assumes that much of the world assumes that she is a racist, but clings to the idea that Edwards knows better: \"I know that she knows, in her heart, that I am not like that.\" (Edwards could not be reached for comment.)\n\nOne recent afternoon, I met with Sabrina Webb, Michael Brown's cousin, on Canfield Drive, at the spot where Brown was killed. A makeshift memorial was in place: a pile of wilted flowers and sun-scorched Teddy bears. She recalled that, when she left her apartment the day after the shooting, \"you could still see brain matter on the street.\" She moved out soon afterward.\n\nWebb was still angry that Wilson had offered condolences only after the grand jury gave its decision. Wilson was interviewed by George Stephanopoulos, of ABC, and he said of Brown's parents, \"I'm sorry that their son lost his life. It wasn't the intention of that day. It's what occurred that day, and there's nothing you can say that's going to make a parent feel better.\" Wilson also reaffirmed, \"I did my job that day.\" I asked Webb how she felt about Wilson. \"Anger and hatred,\" she said. \"There's no forgiveness.\"\n\nMichael Brown, Sr., also feels \"resentment\" toward Wilson, and feels that nothing, not even Wilson's going to jail, can rectify what happened. When we spoke of the day of the shooting, I asked him what he believed had happened at Ferguson Market and Liquor. \"That's just out of character,\" he said. He also insisted that the video didn't \"show all the facts,\" though he wouldn't elaborate. His son, he said, \"was an average kid that did teen-age things and had fun and tried to live his life.\" Brown, Sr., said that two images of his son never leave his consciousness. One is from the last time he saw him smiling. It was on August 1st, the day that Brown graduated. They went out to eat. \"He had on a nice tie,\" Brown, Sr., recalled, quietly. The other memory is of his son lying on the ground, dead.\n\nSince the shooting, gun sales in Ferguson have spiked, and there is little sense of reconciliation. The sixteen members of the Ferguson Commission have been charged with proposing policy reforms. Rasheen Aldridge, the activist, who is a member of the commission, told me that last August he believed that Wilson deserved the death penalty. Since then, his views have softened: \"I can't hold hatred in me for too long.\" He still can't decide what kind of punishment Wilson deserves. \"I want to be, like, 'He needs to go to jail.' But then there's also that other side of me that understands everything. He is probably in prison, in a way.\"\n\nAt one point, I asked Wilson if he missed walking outside and going to restaurants. He told me that he still ate out, but only at certain places. \"We try to go somewhere-how do I say this correctly?-with like-minded individuals,\" he said. \"You know. Where it's not a mixing pot.\"\n\nWilson has received several thousand letters from supporters, and he has written thank-you notes to almost all of his correspondents. Many of the letters are from police officers. Some are from kids. One card reads, \"Thanks for protecting us!\" Wilson proudly showed me a drawer, in his living room, which contained dozens of police-department patches from cops expressing their support. None of those cops, however, had offered him a job. ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Can \"Cop City\" Be Stopped at the Ballot Box?\n\nTwo months ago, I walked to City Hall, in Atlanta, to watch hundreds of angry people talk to their elected officials. Atlanta's city council was set to vote on funding for one of the largest police-and-firefighter-training facilities in the country, which has come to be known, pejoratively, as Cop City-a reference, originally, to a mock village that was part of the proposed complex. The facility, slated to be built on at least eighty-five acres in the South River Forest -a verdant, unincorporated part of DeKalb County, twenty minutes from downtown Atlanta-was endorsed in early 2021 by Keisha Lance Bottoms, then the mayor of Atlanta. Bottoms, a Democrat elected four years earlier with talk of transparency at City Hall and the need for affordable housing, cited rising crime and declining police morale in explaining her support. That May, she announced that she would not seek reëlection. Another Democrat, Andre Dickens, was elected that November, and Cop City became his problem.\n\nBy then, protesters calling themselves \"forest defenders\" had set up camp at the proposed site and were beginning to have skirmishes with police and construction crews. This past January, one of the protesters, Manuel (Tortuguita) Terán, was shot and killed by police officers, who fired at least fifty-seven rounds. Authorities claimed that Terán was armed and shot first, but an autopsy did not provide evidence that Terán discharged a weapon. (The officers involved were not wearing body cameras.) By May, more than forty protesters had been charged with domestic terrorism. A number of them had their bail paid by the Atlanta Solidarity Fund, which is run by a nonprofit. A month later, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation sent SWAT teams to arrest three of the fund's organizers, on charges of money laundering and charity fraud.\n\n\"In terms of sustained damage to the body politic, this is the worst thing that's ever happened to us,\" Howard Shook, the city council's longest-serving member, told me, on the phone, as I walked to City Hall. Nonetheless, Shook, who represents a wealthy district in north Atlanta, supports the project. \"It got off on the wrong foot,\" he said. \"Everyone's been paying the price for a bad first impression.\" Two weeks before we spoke, the Atlanta Community Press Collective had revealed that the facility would cost taxpayers some sixty-seven million dollars, rather than thirty million, as the city had previously claimed. The total budget is ninety million; the rest will be paid by the Atlanta Police Foundation, a nonprofit that raises money for the Atlanta Police Department from some of the largest corporations in the city. The proposed facility's chief fund-raiser was Alex Taylor, a member of the super-wealthy Cox family. The family's company, Cox Enterprises, owns the city's biggest newspaper, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution , and critics have charged that the paper's coverage of Cop City has been less thorough than that of smaller local outlets. A spokesperson for the paper noted that the Journal-Constitution had published more than a hundred stories on the topic, by six different reporters. \"Community members and others can have differing opinions on the conclusions of the reporting,\" the spokesperson wrote in an e-mail, \"but we operate with the highest journalistic standards.\"\n\nThe budgetary discrepancy seemed typical of the project's shifting nature-\"I still don't know what exactly is proposed,\" Shirley Franklin, who was the mayor of Atlanta from 2002 to 2010, told me recently-and the collective's reporting raised hopes among Cop City opponents that the council might send the proposal back to its finance committee. But Shook dismissed the idea. \"We've got to have a state-of-the-art facility,\" he said. \"So I'm for it.\" I asked him what would be lost by pausing a bit longer before building one of the largest such facilities in the country, even as violent crime, and homicide specifically, trends back down in the city. \"Look, the baby is crowning,\" he said. \"We can't shove it back up there for two more weeks.\"\n\nWhen I reached City Hall, it was packed with protesters, media, and at least three dozen uniformed police. I stood near a line that snaked into the council's chamber, chatting with attendees and watching speakers on a big screen in the atrium. A period of public comment began-and lasted longer than fourteen hours, stretching into the next morning. More than three hundred people spoke, and nearly all were opposed to the facility, expressing concerns that ranged from the rise of a police state to the questionable wisdom of razing a forested area as climate change accelerates. The founder of a school , a local artist, and a descendant of the Indigenous Muscogee people who once lived in the forest each made their own cases against the project. A former federal prosecutor, Alex Joseph, suggested that an existing training facility, in another county, could suffice. Many of the speakers cited Atlanta's role in the civil-rights movement, and noted that those who opposed the training facility appeared to be facing the same repressive tactics-police violence, dubious legal charges-that Martin Luther King, Jr. , and his allies had faced sixty years before.\n\nThe fifteen council members watched mostly impassively at first, from a raised platform. As the day wore on, though, frustration mounted, along with hunger and fatigue. Sporadic shouting broke out. \"If you build it, we will burn it,\" a man said. A council member who opposes the project lamented that some of their colleagues had received death threats owing to their position on the issue. At one point, City Hall elevators stopped working; it seemed to some protesters that the building itself was pitted against them. (\"They have not been shut down,\" a council member told the crowd.) Around five-thirty in the morning, just before the sun began to rise, the council approved the facility's funding by a vote of eleven to four-just about the margin that Howard Shook had predicted on the phone with me, eighteen hours earlier.\n\nThe core members of the Cop City opposition weren't surprised, either, and had already hatched a backup plan. \"Many of us had a Spidey sense that the council was going to vote to move on Cop City, and move the resources to it,\" Mary Hooks, an Atlanta-based organizer with the Movement for Black Lives, told me. \"That's when we said, 'All right, after that, within a day or two, we should go ahead and announce that this new tactic is going to emerge.' \" The new tactic involved an old staple of direct democracy: the referendum. Within twenty-four hours of the council's vote, a \"Stop Cop City\" referendum petition was filed and made public.\n\nA paragraph in Georgia's constitution grants residents what's known as home rule: the right to challenge the decisions of local government through a referendum. Such referendums are rare in Georgia, and difficult to bring: at least fifteen per cent of a relevant municipality's registered voters must sign a petition calling for one. Last year, however, a referendum was successfully brought in Camden County, five hours south of Atlanta, challenging a spaceport that Camden County's board of commissioners had already approved. (A former governor had reportedly pitched the project to Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX.) The necessary signatures were collected, and the project was voted down handily. The county challenged the referendum effort-pointing to, among other things, \"duplicate and inconsistent\" voter signatures-and, later, its result. But, in February, the Supreme Court of Georgia upheld the vote, and home rule. (Two of the court's judges, in a concurring opinion, expressed concern that \"groups within a community will be empowered to regularly subject their local community to the expense of a series of referenda as a means of either protest or in an attempt to thwart the will of a fatigued majority in a low turnout election.\")\n\nCamden isn't the only precedent, though. More than two decades ago, citizens of Claxton, in southeast Georgia, pushed for a referendum to reverse the closing of railroad crossings in their city, and, in 1998, Georgia's Supreme Court ruled against them. I asked Zohra Ahmed, an assistant professor at the University of Georgia School of Law, about these conflicting precedents. The Claxton case, like the Cop City referendum, concerned a municipality, she said, but it's older than the Camden decision, \"and the more recent case, in general, is more persuasive.\" Ahmed also felt that the court had \"selectively read\" the constitutional provision in the Claxton case.\n\nThe \"Stop Cop City\" referendum calls for a repeal of the ordinance authorizing the Atlanta Police Foundation's lease on the land where the facility would be built. A coalition of groups, including the Community Movement Builders, Working Families Party, and the Movement for Black Lives, is now working to collect the needed signatures. The groups say they need about sixty thousand signatures, but are hoping to collect at least ten thousand more than that, as a buffer against potential challenges. They aim to have them by August 21st, with the goal of getting on the ballot in November. (A judge extended the deadline to late September, but, the later the signatures arrive, the more likely it is that the referendum will get pushed to a ballot early next year, amid the Republican Presidential primary. The City of Atlanta has appealed the extended deadline.)\n\nA few hundred volunteers, plus some paid workers, fanned out across the city, heading to grocery stores, dog parks, skating rinks, bars, and a \"church crawl.\" In some places, they found that news of the referendum had preceded them. Hooks told me about stopping by a grocery store in the predominantly Black neighborhood of Westview and seeing a poster about the referendum up on the wall. \"They had the petitions right at the checkout counter and had the palm cards already,\" Hooks said. \"They were already talking to folks coming through the line. I was, like, 'Cool. I'll go somewhere else.' \"\n\nIn early July, I went to a neighborhood meeting to hear debate about limiting a road near my home to pedestrian traffic-and recognized Alex Joseph, the former federal prosecutor I'd seen offer comments at City Hall. She had seized on the opportunity to deliver a presentation on the \"Stop Cop City\" referendum. \"I don't get out of bed for fewer than five signatures,\" she said, drawing laughter. Joseph's ten-minute pitch touched on environmental disenfranchisement, the cost to taxpayers, and the recent news that Fulton County, which includes much of Atlanta, also plans to build a smaller-scale police-training academy, which would be \"more convenient\" to use, according to the county manager. \"Fulton County taxpayers are gonna be paying for two of these,\" Joseph said. \"And the Fulton County one is fifteen million dollars. So why is the other one ninety?\"\n\nWhat's more, Joseph went on, there was an existing training facility that local police could also use. \"I used to send people to prison,\" Joseph said, referring to her past career as a prosecutor, \"and I want you to know that there is a perfectly good police-training facility in Forsyth, Georgia,\" about an hour away from downtown Atlanta. \"Not only does it exist-I've been there!\" she went on. \"I've taught there! It's very funny to me when people say, 'You don't believe in police being trained!' I'm, like, 'I literally used to train them.' \" Before ceding the floor, she said, \"If you love democracy, sign! The next stage is we cancel this lease and we discuss a different solution.\" She got fifteen signatures.\n\nMeanwhile, the city of Atlanta has pushed back against the referendum effort in federal court. In mid-July, lawyers for the city argued that Atlanta cannot revoke its lease to the Atlanta Police Foundation, which has already been signed: \"Repeal of a years' old ordinance cannot retroactively revoke authorization to do something that has already been done,\" they said in a court filing. When I asked Alex Joseph about this, she pointed to Camden County. \"We are confident that we are on firm legal footing,\" she said.\n\nOn a very hot afternoon a few days later, a twenty-eight-year-old named Jax Crowder went signature-collecting at a Trader Joe's in midtown Atlanta. Crowder, who was raised in northern Kentucky in a family of law-enforcement officers, served in the Navy, worked as a wrestling coach, and, until recently, belonged to the Libertarian Party. Crowder and another volunteer got three signatures in the grocery store's parking lot before a manager came outside and told them that, although he supported the effort, they needed to leave. At a nearby Starbucks, they got two more. \"You want me to sign something? Because I will,\" a therapist in her thirties told Crowder as she headed to a nearby UPS store. Crowder began explaining the facility's price tag. \"Yeah, it's all fucking ridiculous,\" the therapist said.\n\nA short drive away, the canvass continued in a wealthy neighborhood where many yards had signs advertising the progressive beliefs of their residents. \"We Believe Black Lives Matter, Love Is Love, Feminism Is for Everyone, No Human Being Is Illegal, Science Is Real, Be Kind to All,\" one sign announced. When Crowder rang the bell at that house, a middle-aged man opened the door, saw them, and turned away with a wave of his hand. It was the same sort of thing at a few more homes. For forty-five minutes, Crowder walked up and down long driveways without getting a single signature. One man said he planned to sign that weekend at a neighbor's gathering about the effort; another had company; a woman said she needed her husband, a lawyer, to look at the fine print first. (She eventually signed the petition.)\n\nFinally, Crowder found someone willing to talk: Nidhi Williams, a scientist who had just returned from picking up dinner. She told Crowder that she had worried about her son, who is now in his twenties, growing up in a more militarized world than she had grown up in. \"The first thing I taught my child is, if a cop stops you, do not say a word, just say 'I want to make my phone call, I want to call my father, call my mother,' \" she said. \"Cops are not considered safety people anymore.\" She went on, \"I have no idea what their job is anymore. . . . Give us community people. Go back to the times when we could talk things out.\"\n\nAs Williams spoke to Crowder, her friend Deepika Bahri, a professor of English at Emory University, drove up. She'd recently hosted a signing party where she'd gathered about fifteen signatures, she said. \"I think we shouldn't dismiss the police force's concerns about a viable training facility,\" Bahri said. \"But they could have it elsewhere.\" The South River Forest was too precious. \"That much canopy cover, this is one of the best things that Atlanta has going for it,\" she said. \"My relatives come from Toronto, and they can't get over how green and wonderful it is. Like, no, we don't give up that much coverage. . . . Everybody is affected by the loss of canopy.\"\n\nOn August 9th, Bernice King, a daughter of Martin Luther King, Jr., and the C.E.O. of the King Center, threw her support behind the referendum campaign, signing a public letter that described the proposed location and public cost of the training center as a \"misstep.\" By then, the campaign reported having more than fifty thousand logged signatures sitting in a vault. Another ten thousand, they thought, perhaps with some optimism, were still out in the field, in the hands of the volunteers collecting them. But, in the final weeks, the campaign scrambled to get more, expecting plenty of challenges from the city, which would have nearly two months to review the signatures. I reached out to Mayor Dickens to ask whether he believes that Atlanta voters should be able to decide, after all the conflict and concern expressed in the past two years, whether to build the training center in the South River Forest. A spokesperson, in an e-mail, disputed the notion that a referendum could repeal a city ordinance. This initiative, he wrote, \"would violate the constitutional prohibition on the impairment of contracts. That said,\" he added, \"we welcome public dialogue and engagement around our goal to build the most progressive Public Safety Training Center in the nation.\" ♦\n\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the minimum proportion of a municipality's registered voters who must sign a petition in order to successfully call a referendum.\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Donald Trump's Tax Plan Is a Predictable Cop-out\n\nAs you may have seen, Donald Trump released his tax plan on Monday. He promised to cut income-tax rates for virtually everyone, but especially for the ultra-rich, who would see their top rate reduced from 39.6 per cent to twenty-five per cent. He also promised to slash the corporate tax rate from thirty-five per cent to fifteen per cent, cut the capital-gains tax from twenty-eight per cent to twenty per cent, and abolish the estate tax. As for the Alternative Minimum Tax and the marriage tax penalty, they, too, would disappear.\n\nIn short, Christmas came early to Trump Tower. That's where Trump unveiled his plan , which he called \"Tax Reform That Will Make America Great Again.\" Apparently seeking to downplay the regressive aspects of the plan, he presented it as an effort to simplify the tax code and help ordinary Americans. \"These lower rates will provide a tremendous stimulus for the economy-significant G.D.P. growth, a huge number of new jobs, and an increase in after-tax wages for workers,\" he said in a statement.\n\nI say \"apparently\" because, with Trump, you can never be quite sure how many of the details he has internalized. Under fire a few weeks ago from his Republican opponents for being heavy on talk and light on substance, he promised to put out some actual policy proposals. These ones looked as though they had been ordered online from the Club for Growth, the Heritage Foundation, or Larry Kudlow's consulting firm.\n\nFar from challenging the trickle-down/supply-side fantasies that have become G.O.P. orthodoxy, the author of the Trump plan embraced them wholesale. In fact, he or she appears to have taken Jeb Bush's plan, which is itself a testament to voodoo economics , and simply changed some numbers here and there. Bush would cut the top rate to twenty-eight per cent; Trump would go three percentage points lower. Bush would reduce the corporate tax rate to twenty per cent; Trump would cut it to fifteen per cent. Bush would seek to remove fifteen million low-paid workers from the income-tax rolls; Trump would remove thirty million.\n\nAs Jordan Weissman pointed out at Slate , Trump's plan is simply an \"extra-luxurious\" version of Bush's. It's also extra-fantastical, extra-regressive, and extra-irresponsible. Trump claimed, for instance, that his tax cuts would be revenue neutral, because he would also abolish some loopholes exploited by the rich. But that claim defies arithmetic. According to a preliminary analysis released on Tuesday by the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, the Trump plan would actually reduce over-all tax revenues by ten trillion dollars-yes, trillion-over the coming decade.\n\nAll of which amounts to a sad, if predictable, cop-out on Trump's part. For months now, he has been going around the country promising to raise taxes on hedge-fund managers and other beneficiaries of the notorious carried-interest deduction in the tax code. \"These are guys that shift paper around and they get lucky,\" Trump said on \"Face the Nation\" in August . \"The hedge-fund guys are getting away with murder. They're making a tremendous amount of money. They have to pay taxes.\" In September, again on \"Face the Nation,\" he extended his criticisms to C.E.O.s generally, saying that their high salaries were \"disgraceful\" and \"a total and complete joke.\" His populist rhetoric even won him plaudits on the left. Earlier this month, Senator Elizabeth Warren said , \"Donald Trump and I both agree that there ought to be more taxation of the billionaires, the people who are making their money on Wall Street.\" Paul Krugman wrote a column in the Times that was headlined \"Trump Is Right on Economics.\"\n\nIt turns out that Trump was either bluffing or being cynical. It's true that, in abolishing the carried-interest deduction for hedge-fund managers, he would _ _force them to pay a tax rate of twenty-five per cent instead of twenty per cent on some of their income. But, by reducing the top rate on ordinary income from 39.6 per cent to twenty-five per cent, he would give the hedgies and other members of the one per cent a huge break on the taxes they pay on income not covered by the deduction. In addition, he would introduce a new tax break-a rate of just fifteen per cent on \"pass-through\" income generated by small businesses-that hedge funds and other partnerships might well be able to exploit to their advantage. In the words tweeted out by Len Burman, the respected director of the centrist Tax Policy Center, \"#Trump tax plan is huge tax cut on the rich. How huge is hard to say because details are scarce.\"\n\nTrump's claims about the benefits of his plan for low-paid workers, some of whom would no longer have to pay any federal income taxes (they would still have to make contributions to Social Security and Medicare), were also accurate, in a sense. But the discrepancies between their projected savings and those of high earners are huge. According to an analysis by the liberal group Citizens for Tax Justice, households in the bottom twenty per cent of the income distribution would save about two hundred and fifty dollars a year. Households in the top one per cent would save, on average, nearly a hundred and eighty-five thousand dollars. So much for Donald Trump as the tribune of the masses.\n\nWhy did I refer to this cop-out as predictable? Because I doubted all along that Trump had the depth and gumption to be a genuine American populist-a Huey Long for the Internet age. Such a figure, if he had channeled worries about immigration, ISIS , and national decline, then combined these with some seriously populist proposals designed to exploit resentment of corrupt financial and political élites, could perhaps have emerged as a genuinely potent and dangerous force. But Trump isn't that guy. A self-satisfied showman and self-promoter rather than a real insurrectionary, he ultimately hasn't got much to offer. This tax plan makes it painfully clear.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "What the Utah Good-Nurse, Bad-Cop Video Says About Medical Privacy\n\n\"You're hurting me,\" Alex Wubbels, a nurse in the burn unit at the\nUniversity of Utah Hospital, called out, as Jeff Payne, a Salt Lake City\npolice officer, forced her wrists into handcuffs and dragged and shoved\nher out the hospital door, toward his car. \"Then walk ,\" Payne said.\nWubbels had just declined to violate the rights of an unconscious\npatient (who was not a suspect in a crime), by not allowing the officer to\ndraw his blood. Payne knew that he was not in the right, because Wubbels\nhad shown him a document containing the policy that the hospital had\npreviously worked out with the authorities-no blood without the\npatient's consent, a warrant, or an arrest-and had put her supervisor on\nspeakerphone to reiterate it. In a video of the\nincident , shot from a\npolice body camera, and released by Wubbels's lawyer late last week,\nsomeone protests that Wubbels is just doing her job. \"I'm doing my job.\nShe does hers,\" Payne replies. He was, essentially, punishing Wubbels\nfor refusing to break the rules as a favor to the police. Is that what\nhe thought each job entailed? Wubbels knew otherwise. She was, like\nmany\nnurses ,\ntough. (Indeed, she is a former Alpine skier, who competed for the\nUnited States in the 1998 and 2002 Olympics.) But, beyond the drama of a\nconfrontation between a good nurse and a bad cop, the incident raises\nquestions about matters ranging from the character of policing to\nmedical privacy and how and when you stand up for a colleague.\n\nThe story began on July 26th. That day, the police had engaged in a\nhigh-speed chase on a highway that ended with a deadly multi-vehicle crash. But this was not a\ncinematic case of, say, fugitive armed robbers. It began around 2 P.M. ,\nwhen the police received reports of a Chevrolet Silverado driving\nerratically. As the officers began their pursuit, the Silverado, now on\nUS-89/91, swerved into a semi truck that happened to be on the\nroad, causing an explosion. The driver of the Silverado, Marco Torres,\nwho was twenty-six, was killed instantly. The truck driver, William\nGray-who, in one of this story's many byways, was a reserve police\nofficer in Rigby, Idaho-staggered out of his semi, his clothes and body\non fire. He was airlifted to the burn unit. One might wonder why the\npolice wanted his blood, when he was, essentially, a bystander. The Utah\npolice have said that it was meant for Gray's protection, but Payne, in\nhis report on the incident, obtained by the Salt Lake Tribune , said\nthat the officers who were dealing with the crash wanted to know whether\nGray had any \" chemical\nsubstances \"\nin his system. Another, troubling possibility could be that they were\nlooking for something that might place some of the responsibility for\nthe crash on Gray, in case he complained that the police had been\nreckless in their pursuit.\n\nOne way or the other, Payne wanted Gray's blood. (He had been trained as\na police phlebotomist.) \"I either go away with blood in vials or body in\ntow,\" Payne told Wubbels. Blood does not only indicate whether someone has had a few drinks, smoked marijuana, or used some other drug; it contains an extraordinary amount of information about a person, from\ngenetics to medical conditions that have no effect on driving. The\npotential level of exposure in a blood test will only increase with\nfuture technological developments. That is why the hospital has its rules; that is why\npatient-privacy laws reflect those restrictions; that is why the\nConstitution, as the Supreme Court ruled as recently as last year, also\nforbids what Payne was insisting that Wubbels do. When she asked him,\nnot for the first time, if he had a warrant, he said, \"Nope,\" in a tone\nsuggesting that it was an irrelevant question. And yet the principles\nthat underlie warrants-freedom from search and seizure, privacy-are the\nheart of this matter. \"She's the one that has told me no,\" Payne\nsaid, when a supervisor on speakerphone asked why he was threatening to\narrest Wubbels. Payne was not alone with Wubbels, as she shouted, \"Help!\nHelp! Somebody help me! Stop! Stop! I did nothing wrong!\" Other\npolice officers were at the hospital-three or four of them come and go in the\nvideo-and so were members of the University of Utah police, who stand there looking more\nor less dazed. Some seem to urge Payne to be more gentle, but no one\nstops him from hurting Wubbels. Paramedics make far more of an\neffort-one puts a hand on Wubbels's shoulder until police wave him off,\nand they ask for the officer's name and badge number as they call\nhospital officials for help.\n\nWhen Wubbels's lawyer released the video, the response was professions\nof shock from municipal officials; an apology from the mayor, who called the incident \"not a just arrest\"; statements that multiple internal\ninvestigations were under way; and the announcement that Payne and\nanother member of the department would be placed on administrative\nleave. The Rigby, Idaho, police thanked Wubbels for protecting Gray's\nrights. The hospital called her a \" rock\nstar \"\nfor defending her patient, and apologized for the failure of its own\nsecurity officers. But the police had the video all that time-it was shot on the\ndepartment's own body cam, after all-and, until the wave of publicity,\nhad allowed Payne to remain on active duty, while taking him off\nblood-drawing duty. The chief of police acknowledged that he had not\neven watched the video until Wubbels's lawyer brought it to light,\nproviding another reminder of the difference a video, and civilian\npressure, can\nmake . \"This\ncop bullied me,\" Wubbels told the A.P. \"And nobody stood in his way.\"\n\nIt may have been worse than that. Payne's defense is that his\nlieutenant, James Tracy, whom he spoke to by phone, had urged him to\narrest her. Tracy eventually arrives at the scene in the extended\nvideo , and appears to\nconfirm that Payne acted on his instructions. Tracy also further berates\nWubbels as she sits, handcuffed, in the police car. He tells her that,\nwhile she may be citing hospital rules, he has \"the law\" on his side, a\nformulation he repeats to one of the paramedics who approaches the car,\nsaying, \"There's a very bad habit here of your policy interfering with\nmy law.\" When Wubbels says that she has an obligation \"to my patient,\"\nTracy says that, if it turns out that the request from the police is in violation of the law,\nthere are \"civil remedies\" that could come into play later: \"If we took\nhis blood illegally, it all goes away.\" The implication is that it's\nacceptable to violate a person's rights and then wait and see if someone\nsues. Wubbels was released only after Tracy determined that the hospital\nhad a sample that could be obtained by warrant later; he then tried to\nblame Wubbels and her colleagues for not making this clear earlier,\nalthough she had patiently reviewed the options. The backup Payne got\nmakes the whole story worse, suggesting, as it does, that this is not a\nmatter of one rogue cop but a structural problem. Indeed, it suggests a\nneed to examine, on many levels, the intersection of the health and\ncriminal-justice systems.\n\nIn another segment of video, Payne, who held a second job, with an\nambulance service, can be heard talking about how he sometimes brings\npatients to the university hospital. One of his colleagues remarks that\nthe staff there will not be \"very happy\" with him. (Indeed, the hospital\nhas now changed its policies to prevent police officers from dealing\ndirectly with nurses.) Payne replies that, in that case, \"I'll bring\nthem all the transients and take good patients elsewhere.\" Transients\nare less likely to have health insurance, and thus might cost the\nhospital money. This might have been just talk-and the ambulance company\nhas now placed Payne on leave-but the idea that such assessments, rather than\nmedical need, might determine which direction an ambulance drives is\nrevealing, and another reminder of the distortions of American\nmedicine. Otherwise, it's not clear what makes someone a \"good patient,\"\nin Payne's judgment. His treatment of Wubbels, who can be seen in the\nbackground as he talks about his ambulance work, still confined to the\npolice car, suggests that, in other circumstances, too, he may not be a\ngood judge of character.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "What Is It Like After You Graduate the Police Academy and Become a Real Cop?\n\nThis question originally appeared on Quora . Answer by Tim Dees , retired cop and criminal justice professor, Reno Police Department, Reno Municipal Court, and Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribal Police Department:\n\nLike any other challenging course, it's a relief to be done and exciting to move on to the real thing. The elation is short-lived, however.\n\nDespite having learned a lot about a topic that most people don't understand well (even though many think they do), the real-world task of applying that knowledge to practical situations can be bewildering.\n\nI had a similar experience when I became an EMT. I thought I had learned everything I needed to know, but the first time I was confronted with a real-live patient who was expecting me to do something for them, I couldn't decide where to start.\n\nPhoto by Kayana Szymczak/Getty Images\n\nThe first time you walk into the police station as a new rookie officer, you feel like you belong anywhere but there. Everyone around you is relaxed and confident. You don't know what to say, where to stand or sit, what you're supposed to do first or next. Your gunleather creaks every time you move because it's stiff and hasn't broken in yet.\n\nThis is where your field training officer (FTO, called a coach or mentor in some places) can make life easy or hard for you. He can leave you to fend for yourself and not tell you what you're supposed to do, or, worse yet, he can call you something derogatory like \"boot\" or \"rookie\" and make you feel like an idiot. When I became an FTO, years later, and I saw my new trainee looking especially lost in the briefing room, I'd try and pick out the oldest, saltiest, most senior cop in the room and point him out to the trainee. \"See that guy? He also had a first day.\"\n\nHow your first few days go depends, again, on the FTO. Some FTOs put the rookie behind the wheel of the car right away. My first FTO didn't let me drive the entire time I was with him. My second (and last) FTO split the driving with me 50-50. He would ask me at the start of the watch, \"Do you want to drive first or last?\" At the midpoint of the watch, he would tell me it was time to switch.\n\nMy first assignment was in the drunk wagon, patrolling downtown. There was always at least one wagon on duty (we had two), and it was arguably the busiest unit in patrol. Even on a slow shift, the wagon team would make at least ten arrests, and three times that number was not unheard of. Most of the cases were simple ones - drunk in public and other \"quality of life\" issues - but there were a lot of searches of people, handcuffing, and trips to the jail.\n\nMy policy as an FTO, learned from other FTOs I had the opportunity to watch and learn from, was that I did the first one of everything: the first traffic stop, the first crime report, the first field interview, etc. If the task was a complex one, like a DUI arrest, I might do the first three or five. As each of the three four-week training phases progress, the FTO is supposed to shift more and more of the workload to the trainee. In the FTO program model, my department used (by the time I was an FTO, but the one I trained under was far less structured and formal), called the \"San Jose model,\" there were three four-week phases, each on a different shift and under a different FTO. This was followed by a fourth phase with the original FTO, sometimes called the \"ghost\" or \"shadow\" phase. In this two-week period, the FTO works in street clothes, with the trainee in uniform. The FTO is there only as an observer (unless something goes really, really wrong), reporting on the trainee's activities.\n\nDuring the FTO program, the FTO writes an evaluation on the trainee every day. The trainee is rated on about 20 different categories, such as personal appearance, knowledge of the law, patrol car operation, interviewing skill, defensive tactics, report writing, etc. The number and types of categories vary from one agency to the next. Each category is rated on a scale of one to seven, with anything below a \"4\" as \"below standard.\" Any rating of 1, 2, 6, or 7 has to be documented in the narrative portion of the evaluation. A recap, summary evaluation is written every two weeks. As you might expect, quite a bit of paperwork is involved in this process. Most agencies do it electronically now (This company: Law Enforcement Public Safety Documentation Software produces the software that manages this process).\n\nNow that concealed weapon permits are somewhat more common, carrying an off-duty gun may not be a new experience for the novice officer. When I was a rookie, carrying a gun off-duty was almost exclusively something that cops did, and most new cops can't wait to do it. Academy students are told to keep the guns concealed, but few newbie cops can resist showing off the hardware now and then. It's something that most cops, fortunately, grow out of as they mature in the job.\n\nThe field training program is the first exposure to actual police work, but I know the first time I really felt like a cop was the day I got into the car alone for the first time. It's still bewildering. I wound up calling a sergeant for advice on my very first call for service. I was supposed to take a report on a stolen car, and when I arrived and spoke to the complainant, I found he was drunk. We weren't supposed to take reports from drunks, but at the same time I didn't want to have someone make a complaint against me for refusing to take the report. The sergeant told me to write an incident report documenting the circumstances, and that took care of it.\n\nI don't think there are very many jobs that have as much of a learning curve as policing. It's not only a knowledge challenge, but also an intense socialization. Just about every aspect of your life changes. The job is difficult to acclimate to, and just as difficult to make the adjustment when you leave.\n\nMore questions on Law Enforcement and the Police :\n\nWhat is the best way to respond to a TSA employee who does not follow established TSA guidelines?

      "text": "Is the \"Good Cop, Bad Cop\" Routine a Real Thing?\n\nSandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy\n\nTwentieth Century Fox Film Corporation\n\nIn the new buddy-cop comedy hit The Heat , Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy play Ashburn and Mullins, a mismatched duo tasked with taking down a drug lord. At one point, Ashburn, a by-the-books FBI agent, attempts to calmly interrogate a suspect, only to be abrasively interrupted by the loud Bostonian Mullins, who enters the room and immediately throws a phone book in his face. It's a funny riff on a very familiar routine.\n\nAt this point, a police procedural or cops-and-robbers flick feels almost incomplete without a \"good cop, bad cop\" scene, whether it's portrayed seriously or for laughs. It's become so ingrained in popular culture that the technique-in which two interrogators, one rough and aggressive, the other genial and calm, attempt to will a suspect into compliance-long ago became a metaphor applied to a multitude of situations .\n\nBut do real-life law enforcers actually employ the tactic?\n\nNot as often as movies and TV shows might make you think. Opinions vary on just how prevalent the tactic is. Joseph Pollini, a retired lieutenant commander, told us that it's definitely used on occasion. The typical set-up, he said, will have the intimidating \"bad\" cop first, followed by the more personable \"good\" cop, who assures the suspect that everything will be \"fine.\" Maki Haberfeld, a professor of police science at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, says that it's used \"all the time,\" mainly by detectives. \"When a person is confronted by two individuals, one friendly and one hostile, he or she will ultimately create a much better relationship or zone of comfort with the friendly one,\" Haberfeld explains. \"Especially if the hostile one is truly threatening.\"\n\nBut one veteran NYPD officer told us he finds the dichotomy \"antiquated,\" and suggested it may have been more common when cops faced less scrutiny for brutality against criminals and suspects. Some detainees respond better to anger, he said, while others may respond well to niceness; interrogators in his squad try both approaches, but never in tandem. Joseph Giacalone, a retired NYPD Detective Sergeant, concurred: Pulling the classic version of the routine-in which two people have to essentially put on an act while they take turns interrogating a suspect-can lead to mistakes and mess up the case, he said. \"It's always best to have one person interrogate,\" in his view, someone who has built up a rapport with the suspect. (Most experts agree that the most effective approach for interrogating someone is to establish respect and trust.) Giacalone believes that the \"good cop, bad cop\" routine is more a TV concoction than anything else.\n\nBut the earliest pop-culture examples of the routine predate television. In the 1912 D.W. Griffith short The Burglar's Dilemma , two detectives simultaneously play \"hot and cold\" with a burglar to comic effect . And the oldest name we could find for the tactic comes not from cop shows or from police manuals, but from a comic strip: Prior to any of the printed usages that we dug up of \"good cop, bad cop,\" there are multiple references to the \"Mutt and Jeff routine,\" an allusion to the bumbling main characters of the eponymous comic strip, first published in 1907. (The lanky Mutt is a scheming but foolish horse-race gambler while Jeff is a stodgy insane asylum inmate who also loves the races.) Within a few decades of the strip's debut, their names were used to describe what we now think of as \"good cop, bad cop.\" A 1940 book on police interrogation calls it \" one of the oldest devices in police work ,\" in which one officer takes the role of the \"kindly, stumbling fellow who is always taking the side of the suspect,\" while the other played the \"tough, relentless\" interrogator.\n\nThe earliest printed usage of the phrase \"good cop, bad cop\" that we found dates to 1956. And the phrase doesn't become terribly common until the last 30 years or so, when the routine had begun taking over TV and movie screens. On the heels of the rogue cop blockbusters of the 1970s, the '80s and '90s gave us a slew of police dramas and procedurals that used the trope again and again. Most notable in this regard, perhaps, is Homicide , on which detectives Frank Pembleton (Andre Braugher) and Tim Bayliss (Kyle Secor) formed a brutally effective duo in \"The Box,\" the interrogation room that hosted numerous iterations of good cop, bad cop. (The show was loosely adapted from the nonfiction book by David Simon, which describes good cop, bad cop as a bit of police \"melodrama\" that has \" worn thin over the years .\")\n\nOnce the tactic became shopworn in Hollywood, portrayals began to shift. Nowadays it is rarely depicted as an effective strategy. Take The Dark Knight , where Heath Ledger's Joker mocks Batman and Commissioner Gordon's attempt at the exercise. Even more common these days is good cop, bad cop as farce: Steve Martin electrocuting his nether regions in The Pink Panther , Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg bungling an interrogation in The Other Guys , Finn and Jake playfully attempting the routine in Adventure Time . Or, for that matter, the aforementioned scene in The Heat . \"I need to go to town on him,\" Mullins explains after throwing that phone book. \" I'm doing 'good cop, bad cop'! \"\n\nThe best of \"good cop, bad cop\" on screen:\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Beverly Hills Cop Was a Valentine to Renegade Police. The New Movie Attempts a Different Spin.\n\n\"You fucked up a perfectly good lie,\" Eddie Murphy's Axel Foley says to two Beverly Hills police officers in the smash 1984 hit Beverly Hills Cop . Foley, a Detroit police officer conducting his own freelance investigation in California, just convinced the two straitlaced local officers to join him in a strip club, where Foley foiled an attempted robbery. Covering everyone, he tells the BHPD lieutenant that in fact it was \"supercops\" Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) and John Taggart (John Ashton) who made the bust. When the abashed officers admit that Foley did it all, Foley is befuddled. \"I'm trying to figure you guys out, but I haven't yet,\" he says. \"But it's cool.\"\n\nIt's hard to overstate how famous the first Beverly Hills Cop made Eddie Murphy. The movie topped the box office for 13 straight weeks, from December 1984 to March 1985, and became the highest-grossing R-rated movie in history. Murphy made a triumphant return to host Saturday Night Live ; he made Paramount piles of money; he made an album so dead-serious that his cover photo-Eddie leaning against a white piano-was taken by Annie Leibovitz. (He was so popular that not even releasing the execrable song \"Party All the Time\" could make him less popular.)\n\nThe movie that made all this happen was one of the great Hollywood star vehicles of all time, a movie custom-designed to showcase Eddie Murphy's strengths: his motormouthed wisecracking, his blue-collar smarts, his high spirits, his cool. It did all this while making him that icon of 1980s movie toughness: the maverick cop. Axel Foley's Blackness is expertly played off the white-bread cops he encounters in Beverly Hills. Foley knows how they do things in Detroit , so when he lands in the fantasyland of Beverly Hills, he makes it his mission to teach the by-the-book department what it takes to crack a real crime in a real city.\n\nYou might not remember this the way you remember Serge's mincing malapropisms or Murphy's infectious laugh, but the narrative arc of the first Beverly Hills Cop is, literally, Foley demonstrating to the Beverly Hills officers the power of breaking the rules: talking his way into warehouses without a warrant, disobeying direct orders, charging into a house with gun drawn, and covering up all the misconduct he happened to commit while battling a drug-smuggling art gallery owner. After the movie's climactic shootout, Foley congratulates that same BHPD lieutenant-not for saving lives, but for lying his ass off to the chief.\n\nThe first sequels maintained the original's assertion that police work, when done correctly-that is, with a healthy disregard for stuffy regulations-is a force for good. In 1987's Beverly Hills Cop II , Foley, Rosewood, and Taggart are forced to deal with a bureaucrat who's been installed as the chief-a moron who, everyone agrees, doesn't know anything about real police work. (Despite his meddling, the buddy cops still manage to foil a burglary ring and kill all the bad guys.) In 1994's Beverly Hills Cop III , the villains are a dirty Secret Service agent and the corrupt head of security for an amusement park, but the cops themselves fight doggedly-machine-gunning security guards, etc.-to bring them down.\n\nThirty years later, Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F arrives in an entirely different moment for police officers on screen. These days, it is hard to imagine a studio designing a vehicle for a rising young Black star-in-the-making in which he played a cop. A superhero? Sure. A guy with a badge and a gun? No way. And at a time when the spotlight on police is not highlighting their heroism but revealing their flaws, Axel F becomes the first movie in the series to consider the revolutionary notion that cops lying and covering up their misdeeds might be bad.\n\nAxel F 's opening sequence posits Axel Foley less as an officer of the law and more as a mascot of the city of Detroit, driving around in his crappy car, waving to his pals out on the street, and good-naturedly taking shit from kids. After the de rigueur opening shootout and car chase, Foley's long-suffering chief, played by Paul Reiser, falls on his sword to save Axel's career-not because he thinks that Detroit needs Officer Axel Foley, but because he thinks that Axel Foley needs the job. Foley may be a dinosaur of a cop, but he's got nothing else in his life.\n\nFoley heads back to California because his buddy Rosewood tells him that Foley's estranged daughter, Jane (Taylour Paige), is in trouble. She's an attorney trying to clear an accused cop-killer who she believes was framed. Rosewood agrees and has fallen out with the chief, his old partner Taggart, over Rosewood's claims that a narcotics task force led by Cade Grant (Kevin Bacon) is corrupt.\n\nThe movie's story, by former Los Angeles detective Will Beall, is both convoluted and as simple as can be. Through all the twists and turns, never for a second do we doubt that Jane and Rosewood have it right. From his first appearance on screen, Bacon is hilariously untrustworthy. (\"He's the first police captain I've ever seen in $2,000 Gucci shoes,\" Foley observes.) With Rosewood and Taggart mostly sidelined due to oldness and unfamousness, the movie gives Cade Grant an opposing force in the BHPD in the form of Bobby Abbott (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), an enlightened, by-the-book detective who's trying to untangle the murder case-and who's willing to follow the evidence where it leads.\n\nIf the dramatic arc of Beverly Hills Cop was Axel teaching Rosewood and Taggart that it's OK to lie sometimes when you're a cop-that you don't have to do everything by the book-the dramatic arc of Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F is Axel discovering the nearly unchecked power of a cop who's willing to lie about everything. A crooked cop in a position of power can make lots of people's lives difficult: the fall guy stuck in prison, accused of a crime he didn't commit; Jane, dangled out the window by masked men; Foley himself, ambushed on an L.A. street by gunmen sent by Grant.\n\nWhen Foley asks Grant about the freelance thugs he uses for his departmental dirty work, Grant smirks-and reminds Foley of the creative policing in his own history. \"You know what I'm talking about, Axel,\" he says. \"You're no altar boy yourself.\" Grant claims that he's under enormous pressure to solve the murder of one of his task force's officers, and what will he do to secure the necessary evidence? \"I will do whatever it takes,\" he says. It takes planting drugs in Bobby Abbott's car; it takes kidnapping Jane; it takes torturing Billy Rosewood.\n\nIt's not that Axel Foley is unaware of the concept of police misconduct. (While getting arrested by beat officers who order him not to reach for his badge, he cracks, \"I been a cop for 30 years. I've been Black a whole lot longer. Trust me, I know better.\") It's that he-like the movie-makes a distinction between a real bad cop and a good bad cop who sometimes breaks every single rule, but for the right reasons. This is a delicate distinction to pull off, and it's no match for the demands of the old-fashioned action-comedy. By the time Foley and his two partners, Bobby and Billy, lead a wild police chase down L.A. freeways, the movie's having a good old time. \"Never been on this end of a pursuit before,\" Abbott mutters. \"It's an acquired taste,\" says Rosewood, grinning like a madman. \"Has he taken you to a strip club yet?\"\n\nIn the movie's final faceoff, as Foley and Grant point guns at each other, Grant tries to erase the distinction between them once and for all. \"We're just a couple of lonely old cops,\" he says. \"What are we gonna do? Kill each other? What's the point in that?\"\n\n\"Ain't nobody trying to hear that shit you talking,\" Foley barks. \"You're not a cop. You're a criminal!\"\n\nIn the year 2024, I'm not convinced quite so many viewers are going to be interested in parsing the differences between Axel Foley and Cade Grant. It's been three decades since the last Beverly Hills Cop movie, long enough for a sea change in the way viewers think about police-hell, long enough for the real-life officer who played Axel Foley's boss to be accused, himself, of being a corrupt cop . I'm sure Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F will be perfectly successful for Netflix, drawing an audience hungry for nostalgia-nostalgia the movie serves up willingly. It's nostalgic for the era of big movie stars whose personality can carry a whole movie. It's nostalgic for the big gunfights of the 1980s, our heroes taking out machine-gun-toting bad guys with deadeye aim. Most of all-despite its gestures toward the complicated present-it's nostalgic for a time when the audience believed there could be such a thing as a good bad cop. I wonder if the audience will believe that now.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Appeals Court: Homeless Man Has No Right to Sue Cop Who Let Police Dog Maul Him\n\nFiona Goodall/Getty Images\n\nOn Thursday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4 th Circuit issued one of the most gruesome and inhumane decisions in recent memory, holding that the Constitution does not necessarily require law enforcement officers to stop police dogs from brutally mauling innocent people. If it stands, the decision would ensure that a homeless man who was disfigured by a police dog will not be able to sue a police officer who knew the man was innocent and allowed the dog to continue attacking him. It is an astonishing ruling that defies all logic and illustrates the grave threat that qualified immunity poses to constitutional rights today.\n\nThe grisly facts of the case are uncontested. One night in 2010, Officer Terence Garrison and his police dog, Bikkel, were tracking a robbery suspect in High Point, North Carolina. Bikkel led Garrison to an abandoned house, then attacked a man crouched behind a bush near the front stoop. Garrison quickly realized that the man did not match the physical description of the suspect. (In fact, he was Christopher Maney, a homeless man accused of no crime.) But Garrison decided that the man might still be dangerous, so he demanded that Maney show his hands before calling off Bikkel. But Maney was using his hands to try to protect himself against the dog and pleaded with Garrison to stop Bikkel's attack, insisting that he had done nothing wrong. After allowing the mauling to continue for 10 seconds, Garrison finally told Bikkel to stop. He then put Maney in handcuffs and called medical support.\n\nManey arrived at the hospital in critical condition. Bikkel had bit the top of his head, tearing away a two-square-inch section of hair, skin, and tissue that ultimately required a nearly 16-inch skin graft. Deep bites on Maney's arm and thigh led to a brachial artery blood clot and profuse bleeding, bruising, and swelling.\n\nAfter convalescing, Maney sued Garrison, alleging a violation of his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizures. Under the Fourth Amendment, a dog bite qualifies as a seizure of the person, and Maney argued that Garrison prolonged the biting for an unreasonable amount of time. But the 4 th Circuit concluded that Garrison was shielded from the lawsuit by qualified immunity, meaning he did not violate a \"clearly established\" constitutional right. According to the majority, Fourth Amendment precedents do not unambiguously prohibit officers from \"prolong[ing] a dog bite seizure until a subject complies with orders to surrender.\" The majority analogized the mauling to a \" Terry stop,\" during which an officer may briefly stop and frisk individuals on the basis of \"reasonable suspicion.\" Garrison, the majority concluded, had really just engaged in a type of Terry stop in which \"the classic Terry tableau is replaced by something more dynamic.\"\n\nAs Judge Pamela Harris explained in dissent, this analysis is disturbing nonsense:\n\nManey was not himself suspected of any crime, armed or not, and he did not attempt to flee or to resist. Nevertheless, Officer Garrison deliberately subjected him to a canine attack in order to rule out any possibility that he might pose a threat. Whether or not a more customary Terry stop might have been authorized, I think it is clear enough that the circumstances did not justify the sustained mauling of Maney. Clear enough, that is, to warrant denial of qualified immunity to Garrison on Maney's excessive force claim.\n\nHarris noted that the Terry analysis is especially ridiculous because \"there was not reasonable suspicion sufficient to support a Terry stop\" in the first place. Just before encountering Maney, Garrison had walked through a homeless camp just 150 yards away. \"He was aware,\" Harris wrote, \"that there was a perfectly innocent explanation for Maney's presence near the abandoned house. And I would not count against Maney his failure to stand and identify himself, which Maney-quite reasonably, in hindsight-attributes to his fear that a sudden movement might prompt a dog attack. Citizens are under no free-standing obligation to identify themselves to the police.\"\n\nIn other words, Garrison did not have sufficient justification to stop Maney in the first place. And he certainly didn't have a good reason to do what he did next-\"intentionally prolong a violent assault on Maney to determine whether he might pose a threat.\" In reality, Harris wrote, Garrison had clearly utilized excessive force under longstanding Supreme Court precedent , inflicting objectively unreasonable and disproportionate violence that \"no reasonable officer\" would consider to be legal. Thus, Harris argued, Garrison should not be protected by qualified immunity.\n\nHarris is obviously correct, but her colleagues in the majority cannot be entirely blamed for disregarding Maney's constitutional rights. The Supreme Court has expanded qualified immunity-a doctrine of dubious constitutional provenance -to such an extreme that police officers routinely get away with acts of shocking brutality . It has grown increasingly difficult for victims of such violence to hold officers accountable in court; a clever judge can almost always find a reason why some particular barbarity was not \"clearly\" forbidden by the Fourth Amendment when it occurred. Maney is only the latest victim of qualified immunity run amok. The list will continue growing apace.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "In the 1990s, Terminator 's Ultimate Evil Took the Form of a Cop. In 2019, It's the U.S. Border Patrol.\n\nThe new Terminator: Dark Fate is a direct sequel to Terminator 2: Judgment Day , which got a lot of ink back in 1991 for the pioneering digital animation that allowed its shape-shifting villain, the T-1000, to swap faces and bodies in real time. But the movie's practical effects wizard-Stan Winston, who'd won his first Academy Award for his work on Termin-auteur James Cameron's 1986 Aliens and would earn three more for T2 and Jurassic Park -advised his buddy Jim that the movie's mercurial antagonist should have a default appearance. Dramatic imperative trumped narrative logic: While the T-1000 would surely be a more effective \"infiltration unit\" if it updated its disguise constantly, the audience needed a familiar figure to root against. Accepting Winston's note, Cameron called his friend back later that evening with a flash of inspiration: Their liquid-metal boogeyman would be a cop. Though the T-1000 adopts several guises over the course of the movie, it inevitably morphs back to its most fearsome visage: Robert Patrick, cosplaying as an LAPD flatfoot.\n\nIn a movie full of shrewd choices, this was Cameron's coup de grâce. Police drag made tactical sense, allowing the T-1000 to prowl the gunmetal-tinted streets of Cameron's Los Angeles unchallenged. But the future King of the World's antennae were also picking up something in the zeitgeist of 1990, when T2 went into production. Movies and TV shows had, with few exceptions, depicted police in general and the LAPD in particular as fundamentally honorable. But Cameron approached the character differently. \"Cops think of all noncops as less than they are: stupid, weak, and evil,\" he observed years later on the movie's DVD commentary.\n\nBy the time T2 was released, current events had borne him out. The movie hit theaters in July of 1991, four months to the day after the March 3 beating of Rodney King by LAPD officers-an incident captured by bystander George Holliday on a videotape that also contained footage of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Eddie Furlong shooting T2 in the San Fernando Valley a few weeks earlier. About 10 months after the film's release, the four officers who'd struck the unarmed King 56 times with their batons were acquitted on excessive force charges, sparking six days of riots that killed 63 people.\n\nThe best of movies, TV, books, music, and more, delivered three times a week.\n\nThe O.J. Simpson trial, which featured LAPD detective Mark Fuhrman being questioned on the stand about his use of racist epithets, followed in 1995, as did Strange Days , a flawed but fascinating near-future drama written by Cameron and directed by his former spouse Kathryn Bigelow, wherein two white LAPD officers murder a black hip-hop star and attempt to frame others for the crime. And before the end of the decade, the Rampart scandal would implicate more than 70 LAPD officers in crimes including drug dealing, bank robbery, and unprovoked shootings.\n\nCameron couldn't have known these dark events were around the corner unless he'd built an actual time machine-which is obviously absurd; all he did was build a one-of-a-kind submarine that he piloted himself to become one of three people in history to have descended to the deepest part of the ocean. But the best genre storytellers are tuned in to the collective subconscious in a way that can make them seem like prophets.\n\nDark Fate, which retroactively aborts (to quote The Terminator ) the three non-Cameron, non-Hamilton follow-ups released between 2003 and 2015, carries on this tradition. Its killer bot, the Rev-9, spends the most memorable section of the movie impersonating a type of lawman whose stock is even lower now than the LAPD's was in 1990: a U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent. Played by Gabriel Luna, the Rev-9 takes on that guise to hunt Dani Ramos (Natalia Reyes), a Mexican factory worker who is effectively Dark Fate 's John Connor-an unsuspecting target whose existence is key to humanity's future survival.\n\nDark Fate's best set piece comes when Sarah (Linda Hamilton, back in the saddle), Dani, and cyborg-bodyguard-from-the-future Grace (Mackenzie Davis) are spotted by a surveillance drone the Rev-9 has hacked while the three women attempt to sneak across the Mexican border into Texas. (They're aided by a relative of Dani's who works as a mule.) The Rev-9 sees to it the trio is arrested, knowing they'll be detained in a CBP facility, then infiltrates the prison in his CBP uniform to kill Dani. In the chaos that erupts, the cages are opened and hundreds of detainees are at least momentarily freed.\n\nLike the T-1000, the Rev-9 can mimic the appearance of anyone it chooses; as with the T-1000, the filmmakers-a committee that includes Cameron for the first time since T2 -keep their villain in law enforcement garb even after the strategic value of the disguise has been expended. Albeit not all the way through the movie: For Dark Fate 's next (not nearly as absorbing) set piece, the Rev-9 must sneak onto an Air Force base and commandeer a plane, so it mimics a more appropriate military-issue camouflage.\n\nBy then the murder-bot has marshaled the infrastructure and personnel of the Border Patrol, drones and humans alike, as his collaborators. The T-1000 didn't do that; it was a solo act, a wolf in cop's clothing. The Rev-9 actually manipulates the CBP as an institution to accomplish his mission. Like Skynet in the prior movies-or Legion, the new malignant A.I. enemy in this one-the CBP is an entity meant to protect us that eventually decides there's no reason to bother with the chore of discerning friendlies from hostiles. All it took to trigger this deadly shift was one malicious actor hijacking a national law enforcement agency to serve its own dark ends.\n\nThe Rev-9 stays in his CBP garb long enough for the image to lodge in memory, like the vision of the red-eyed, blown-apart chrome T-800 endoskeleton pulling itself across the floor with its one remaining arm that, the story goes, appeared to Cameron in a fever dream and compelled him to write The Terminator in the first place.\n\nThe makers of Dark Fate haven't said anything that would suggest they want their movie read as some kind of allegory pleading for a more humane approach to immigration and border enforcement. Many critics have dismissed the notion that Dark Fate has any political worldview at all-but that's the franchise fatigue talking. Admittedly, a simple reading is complicated in that both Luna, a Texan of Mexican descent, and Reyes, who is Colombian, are Latino. But just because the signal is somewhat scrambled doesn't mean it isn't there. When smart genre filmmakers are doing their best work, they build in this sort of plausible deniability. Playing coy is better than unambiguous moralizing, because that way lies, well, Avatar .\n\nSpeaking to the Los Angeles Times in 1991 about the coincidence of T2 footage preceding the Rodney King footage on the Holliday tape, Cameron said: \"That, to me, is the most amazing irony considering that the LAPD are strongly represented in 'Terminator 2' as being a dehumanized force. What the film is about, on the symbolic level, is the dehumanization we do on a daily basis.\" When it comes to systematic dehumanization, the LAPD is no longer the most advanced model.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "I Learned to Think Like a \"Warrior Cop\"\n\nPop quiz! What is the third thing-besides weapons and skills-that you need to survive armed combat? Is it:\n\nA. Ammunition? B. Body armor? C. Tactical advantage? D. The will to kill?\n\nThe answer is D, obviously-or at least it would be obvious if you knew that the question is part of an online course, called \" On Combat ,\" that is steeped in a pseudo-academic field called \"killology,\" and that the instructor and creator, Dave Grossman , is the foremost killologist on the planet. When I decided recently to learn how to be a warrior cop, Grossman's course is where I turned.\n\nI am not a cop and will almost certainly never become one. But earlier this year, I became very interested in understanding how police officers think-how the mindsets they nurture might be related to outcomes such as the killings of Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky, and George Floyd in Minneapolis, and the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin. The nationwide protest movement that erupted in May has called attention to the problem of overaggressive and racist policing in America, raising some very specific questions about police training and threat-assessment methods, situational escalation, and police tolerance of community dissent. In the background of all of this is the ongoing militarization of the American police department. Many cops these days are functionally indistinguishable from soldiers-in terms of the gear they use, the image they project, and the mindset that they embody.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons for this evolution. As Radley Balko writes in his 2013 Rise of the Warrior Cop , much of it has to do with federal incentives for police departments to pursue this country's endless war on drugs. But another answer is that there is a cottage industry of trainers and consultants who encourage police to see their beats as a battlefield.\n\nA retired Army lieutenant colonel with a master's of education in counseling psychology , Dave Grossman is one of America's best-known independent police trainers-and one of the foremost exponents of the \"warrior cop\" mindset. Under the aegis of his Killology Research Group -he defines killology as \"the scholarly study of the destructive act, just as sexology is the scholarly study of the procreative act\"-Grossman travels the country offering continuing-education seminars to cops and cop-adjacents. He musters scientific research, anecdotal evidence, and a boatload of presuppositions in order to prepare his students for the realities of combat, while valorizing the notion that the thin blue line is humanity's last bulwark against total societal collapse.\n\nMany have argued that \"warrior cop\"-style training seminars teach law enforcement officers to start from a place of fear, which can lead them to quickly turn peaceful situations violent. The officer who shot and killed Philando Castile during a 2016 traffic stop in Falcon Heights, Minnesota, had attended a \"Bulletproof Warrior\" course co-taught by Grossman and a colleague, Jim Glennon, two years earlier. Over his career, according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune , that officer had clocked more than 100 hours of trainings on topics such as firearms usage, street survival, and the use of force-but had only attended two hours of deescalation training.\n\nA lot of cops want to hear from Grossman-and so did I. Though I couldn't take one of his in-person courses- Grossman's touring calendar , normally packed with engagements, has been empty since the pandemic began-I decided to spend $79 to take the online version of \"On Combat\" that can be found on his Grossman Academy website (the other courses are \"On Killing\" and \"The Bulletproof Mind\"). The class is divided into eight hourlong units. Each is effectively an enhanced PowerPoint presentation, with Grossman narrating the slides that appear on screen. Occasionally, as a treat, Grossman himself will pop up on screen to tell a story or underscore a point. Each unit ends with a five-question multiple-choice quiz, but the quizzes are not particularly challenging, and students can take them over and over again until they get a passing grade.\n\nI came away with a certificate of completion from Grossman Academy (the o in \"Grossman\" is a rifle sight), an abiding dislike for the term sheepdog , and a much better sense of how and why so many American police officers seem to believe that the streets of America are effectively a war zone-and why the average American police department seems so resistant to reform.\n\nYou can define a police officer's job in a lot of ways: to solve crimes, to maintain order, to help people in need. In the first unit of \"On Combat,\" Grossman characterizes cops as basically like the Avengers, but with more body armor and less public accountability. \"Think about it,\" Grossman says, \"if we went but a single generation without men and women who are willing to go out every day and confront evil, then within the span of that generation we should surely be both damned and doomed.\"\n\nGrossman's America is a terrifying place where police are both the primary targets of and defenders against superpredation. \"Increasingly the police must face organized opponents armed with assault rifles and bombs,\" Grossman says at the outset of the class, citing an \"explosion in violent crime\" and an \"extraordinary rise in violence\" in the streets of America . (The online course bears a copyright date of 2014; many of the incidents that Grossman cites throughout the course happened in the 1990s.) Though many independent sources show that the violent crime rate in America has steadily declined since the early 1990s, Grossman maintains that America is now scarier than ever-and that cops may well be the ones with the most to fear. \"We know that if it were not for all the body armor, bulletproof vests worn by officers, law enforcement fatalities in the United States would easily be double or even triple what they are today,\" Grossman asserts. \"If this is not war, then you tell me what is.\"\n\nWell, war is war: combat waged between states, or states and state-adjacent groups, or states and organized insurrections that hope to topple the state. What Grossman is describing is violent crime, the penalties for which are prescribed by civilian codes of law. But Grossman, who spent decades in the U.S. Army, doesn't just blur the line between soldiers and police officers: He completely erases it.\n\nWhen people talk about military-style policing, they are often referring to the militarized gear and weaponry that many police departments prefer these days: the body armor, the semi-automatic rifles, the armored SWAT Humvees equipped to recapture Fallujah. But the gear is just a symptom of these departments' gradual adoption of the premise that the world is now a theater of war and that battles are most easily won through the liberal use of shock and awe. \"You've probably heard of the Big Bang Theory,\" Grossman says in Unit 2. \"I call this the Bigger Bang Theory, which states that, all other things being equal, in combat, whoever makes the bigger bang wins.\" Combat has clear military connotations, and Grossman's frequent use of the term undergirds the course's martial framing.\n\nGrossman wants cops to develop \"autopilot responses\" so that they will not be caught flat-footed when confronted by an armed suspect. \"Is it possible to see a gun pointed at you, draw your own weapon, and shoot without conscious thought?\" Grossman asks. \"Not only is it possible, in this case it is highly desirable. Of course, his training must be state-of-the-art, so that he knows instantly that the threat is indeed a gun, and not a wallet or a cellphone.\" In practice, many cops have had trouble clearing this threat-assessment barrier.  (\"You shot four bullets into him, sir. He was just getting his license and registration, sir,\" Castile's girlfriend told the cop who shot and killed him.)\n\nGrossman makes sure to clarify that deadly force should be used \"only under the rules of engagement,\" and very few people would disagree with that caveat. But rules of engagement is also a military term, and its usage is just another willful conflation of policing and war. Grossman invokes terrorist attacks, school shootings, and a \"large-scale epidemic of preteen and teenage mass murderers\" who have been trained to kill on \"murder simulator\" video games-he spends a lot of time on this last point, and it is fairly exhausting-in order to argue that your local Officer Friendly should prepare himself to go ahead and unleash his inner G.I. Joe.\n\n\"As a cop, or a peacekeeper, your job is not to kill. It is to serve and protect. To do that, you may have to kill,\" he says in Unit 4. \"The most effective way to stop someone is to fire a bullet into his central nervous system. It is up to God and the paramedics as to whether the man dies. Your job is to stop the deadly threat, and the most effective way to do that is to make the threat die.\" Throughout \"On Combat,\" Grossman is very, very clear that police officers must be ready to manifest the will to kill-and to deal with the aftermath of having done so.\n\n\"On Combat\" borrows from Grossman's book of the same name, which he co-wrote with Loren W. Christensen. In it, Grossman draws on his academic background to break down the neurological, physiological, and emotional responses that participants can expect to experience before, during, and after combat situations. It's true that cops who are better able to control and understand their bodies and emotions while on duty are probably less likely to act recklessly. But Grossman's goal isn't to stop cops from killing; it's to train them to do so more efficiently. To this end, he wants his students to understand how their minds and bodies work so that they can suppress any intrinsic resistance when it's time to pull the trigger.\n\n\"Any natural or learned resistance to killing, any sense of the sanctity of human life, any human emotions, any remorse or compassion at the moment of truth can all be overcome and overwhelmed with training,\" Grossman says in Unit 2. What's more, he says, even a post-traumatic stress reaction can be averted with training. He acknowledges that killing in the line of duty can be very unsettling. He presents a lot of material on how a cop might expect to feel after having done so, and how their colleagues and family can help them process and cope with the experience. Grossman does not deny the reality of PTSD. But he also argues that cops who kill need not be scarred for life by their actions. \"If you do the rationalization and acceptance ahead of time, if you prepare yourself and immerse yourself in the lore and spirit of mature warriors, past and present, then the lawful, legitimate use of deadly force does not have to be a self-destructive or traumatic event,\" Grossman says.\n\nGrossman wants his students to become \"mature warriors\" who can sleep at night untroubled by the bodies they've left in their wake. Though Grossman recently told the Spokane, Washington, Spokesman-Review that the warrior model is not central to his training methods, it was certainly a large part of the course I took, which anyone can take right now. \"We are warriors,\" he says in Unit 1, and the theme recurs throughout the course. Unit 4 literally features a slide of a uniformed cop standing next to a medieval suit of armor, as if to underscore the ostensible link between the paladins of yore and the SWAT teams of today.\n\nGrossman refers to his students as \"sheepdogs,\" battle-ready protectors who are innately responsible for-and tacitly superior to-their noncombatant charges. \"We know that the sheep live in denial; that is what makes them sheep. They do not want to believe that there is evil in the world,\" says Grossman. \"They can accept the fact that fires can happen, which is why they want fire extinguishers, fire sprinklers, fire alarms, and fire exits throughout their kids' schools. But many of them are outraged at the idea of putting an armed police officer in their kids' school.\" (\"On Combat\" doesn't consider whether putting armed cops in schools may well be a solution in search of a problem. There is plenty of evidence to suggest that the presence of armed officers does not serve to deter school shooters or reliably stop shootings in progress.)\n\nBut what recourse do the sheep have when the sheepdog becomes the wolf? The course spends no time acknowledging any of the ways in which cops may abuse their power, and it certainly does not acknowledge the long history of ongoing mistrust between many communities and their police departments. Though I did not expect him to-the name of the course is \"On Combat,\" after all, not \"A People's History of Police Work\"-Grossman does not address the social construction of crime and criminality, or the historically racist coding of \"tough on crime\" policies and rhetoric, or the political origins of this country's endless drug war, or any other factors that might complicate his Manichean thesis. He sees no oppression in the sight of warrior cops forever riding roughshod through \"bad\" neighborhoods like members of an occupying army. He does not stop to consider that treating the \"war on crime\" like an actual war tacitly encourages cops to take less care with the lives of their \"enemies\"-nor does he acknowledge that those disposable lives are all too often Black ones.\n\nWhile Grossman does spend part of Unit 3 discussing the phenomenon of civilians filming on-duty cops, he does so in the course of disparaging the tapers' motives and advancing his \"cops are under siege\" motif: \"Sometimes these videographers do creative editing to make the police look bad and then take the doctored videotape to the media.\" Grossman has little use for the media. \"Do the media people know that they are hurting people? Of course. They even admit it. Do they care? Apparently not,\" Grossman says in Unit 6. \"We are dealing with an industry functioning at the moral level of drug dealers; in fact, one of their objectives is to convince us to legalize drugs.\" He also blames violent video games and entertainment products as prime factors in America's alleged decline and fall-an argument you hear often from gun proponents looking for an alternative explanation for shootings. \"Violent video games are murder simulators,\" he says, \"except when police officers and soldiers use them for training, in which case they are combat simulators.\"\n\nTo Grossman, who makes much of school shootings as the proving grounds for game-addled, kill-crazed teens, the difference is clear. To others, the difference between \"murder\" and \"combat\" might not be so obvious. In 2019, according to Education Week , eight people in America were killed in a school shooting; 35 people were killed that way in 2018. But 999 people in America were shot and killed by the police in 2019, according to the Washington Post , and in 2018, 990 people were killed that way. Even if 95 percent of these deadly police shootings were unquestionably justifiable, the body count of the remaining 5 percent would still be higher than the body count from the school shootings that Grossman repeatedly cites as proof that it's war out there.\n\nBut the streets of America are not a war zone. Police work is not combat. Cops are not soldiers. Property damage is not a capital offense, Black men and women are not targets for shooting practice, and Americans demanding police reform are not tantamount to some fifth column of saboteurs. In the wake of the Floyd case and other incidents, communities across America are asking their police departments to reconsider their roles and responsibilities, to pursue demilitarization, and to learn to deescalate the dangerous situations that they too often create.\n\nGrossman has not, as far as I can tell, gone on record with his thoughts about this summer's police reform movement. But in recent years, his style of trainings has seen a backlash from municipalities that now find them troubling, as well as a counterbacklash from police officials who seemingly can't get enough of the \"will to kill.\" When Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey banned warrior cop-style courses in 2019, the local police union offered to pay for any cop who wanted to take one. When a woman in Spokane, Washington, launched a petition earlier this year to urge the county sheriff's office to cancel an upcoming \"mindset bootcamp\" seminar from Grossman, the sheriff vowed that the course would go on as planned. \"I am tired of being bullied by political rights and left,\" the sheriff told the Spokesman-Review ; earlier this month, he told a local television station that the opposition was spearheaded by \"a group of progressive socialist[s]\" who are \"actually promoting a lie about the training.\"\n\nYou want to know the truth about the training? Take it from me, a proud holder of a certificate of completion from Grossman Academy: \"On Combat\" teaches its students to fear and resent the people they serve, to willfully mistake this contempt for bravery, and to believe that heroism is conferred by the barrel of a smoking gun. This philosophy, as manifested by the countless police officers and officials who subscribe to it, is and will continue to be one of the foremost impediments to meaningful efforts at police reform in towns across America. \"If we do not keep the warrior in the mix, we become glorified social workers with guns,\" Grossman says very early in \"On Combat\"-and even if that's what the communities whose taxes pay their salaries want from their police officers, Grossman implies that it is those officers' patriotic duty to resist.\n\n\"In this dark hour, our mission is to rise up and nurture the next generation of warriors,\" Grossman says at the very end of the course, his words illustrated by a photograph of a cop standing in the middle of a city street. The cop's arms are crossed. He wears mirrored sunglasses, a baseball cap that says \"POLICE,\" and a resolute half-smirk on his face, as if daring the sheep and wolves alike to try to move him off his spot.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Cop Shows Are Undergoing a Reckoning-With One Big Exception\n\nAs the nation confronts police in the streets, many of the people who have brought rosy depictions of American policing into our homes are having second thoughts. The cascade began when actor Griffin Newman, who played a detective on CBS's Blue Bloods , tweeted a receipt of his $10,000 contribution to Community Justice Exchange . Soon after, his feed began to fill up with evidence of others following suit, from Brooklyn Nine-Nine star Stephanie Beatriz , who matched his contribution, to more modest donations from people who simply played cops in their high school plays, many of them donating through Act Blue and using the hashtag #BlueActorsActBlue . Beatriz later announced that the cast of her police sitcom, which premiered on Fox before moving to NBC, had pooled their resources to donate $100,000 to the National Bail Fund Network .\n\nI'm an out-of-work actor who (improbably) played a detective on two episodes of BLUE BLOODS almost a decade ago. If you currently play a cop? If you make tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in residuals from playing a cop? I'll let you do the math. pic.twitter.com/En4ww2OSjP\n\n#justiceforGeorgeFloyd https://t.co/0k1VlQtP1o pic.twitter.com/D8vOh9cS8D\n\nWhat we appear to be seeing is a moment of accountability for the people who've created and starred in the widespread depictions of American policing on television, in which the cops are almost always the good guys, even if some are more complex than others. And even when they're not wholly good, they're still the ones whose perspectives we see and whose feelings viewers are trained to empathize with. As Vulture's Kathryn VanArendonk wrote on Monday, \" The cops are still at the center , still the point of view we use to interpret the world, still the characters we follow week after week. As TV viewers we are locked inside a police perspective, harnessed to their needs, desires, and daily rhythms.\"\n\nThe ramifications go beyond conscience-salving donations. Law & Order creator Dick Wolf announced Tuesday that he'd fired Craig Gore , a writer-producer on a forthcoming spinoff for NBC starring SVU 's Christopher Meloni, in response to social media posts in which Gore posed with what looked like an assault rifle and threatened to shoot looters. Among the other actors and writers who have spoken out or encouraged donations to anti-racist organizations are comedian Tom Scharpling , who was an executive producer on the USA Network procedural Monk , and actor Nathan Fillion , star of ABC's The Rookie , along with Rookie creator Alexi Hawley .\n\nBut it's also worth noting whom we haven't heard from-namely most of the individuals associated with CBS, which has built its brand over the past 20 years on police procedurals like CSI , NCIS , Criminal Minds , Hawaii Five-O, and Blue Bloods , to name only a few, shows that generally portray police officers as not only noble and heroic but at times close to superhuman. Both prosecutors and defense attorneys have found themselves battling what they call \" the CSI Effect ,\" when jurors steeped in show's invented techniques are left unimpressed by real evidence that doesn't come with flashy computer graphics achieved on a Hollywood budget. Defense attorneys have argued that techniques popularized by shows like CSI often amount to little more than guesswork, but to watch the show, you'd think they were little short of magic.\n\nNew, from the company that brought you \"SWAT,\" \"Blue Bloods,\" \"Hawaii Five-O,\" \"Criminal Minds,\" \"JAG,\" \"NCIS,\" \"NCIS: Los Angeles,\" \"NCIS: New Orleans,\" \"CSI,\" \"CSI: Miami,\" \"CSI: New York,\" and \"CSI: Cyber,\" it's \"Minorities Are An Important Part Of Our Business Model, As Well\" https://t.co/X7UP42PKaO\n\nCBS may have tweeted out a corporate statement in (tepid) support of Black Lives Matter , and a few CBS stars, including NCIS: Los Angeles' LL Cool J , have gotten more fiery, but a report on \" Normalizing Injustice \" released earlier this year found that the network was a prime offender in distorting Americans' view of law enforcement and lagged far behind on diversity statistics as well. If the country is going to change its relationship to the police, that means shifting the way they're depicted as well. That doesn't mean every TV cop show has to be a hard-nosed exposé of misconduct on the force-as Aisha Harris wrote for Slate, it's fine to escape into the fantasy of Brooklyn Nine-Nine 's harmoniously diverse, good-natured precinct , as long as you're aware that it's a fantasy. But the balance has to shift. It should reflect a world in which most people are subject to the police, and the police are not always subjects.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Cop Drama\n\nPhoto by Allison Joyce/Getty Images\n\nOn social media and other forums, there's a vast gulf-and a lot of shouting-between critics of police departments (\"Black Lives Matter\") and police defenders (\"Blue Lives Matter\"). But this ideological divide belies the fears and worries they have in common.\n\n\"They don't go out every day saying, 'I'm going to take a life today,' \" said Mary Jo Graves, referring to police officers after she organized a pro-police march in Cleveland last month . \"They go out saying, 'I want to come home.' They want to come home to their families.\"\n\nThis sympathy- police officers just want to do their work without fear of death -isn't too different from what police critics have to say about their friends and family. \"I am tired of being scared that my son is not going to make it home from work,\" said Dinetta Gilmore, who participated in the Justice for All march in Washington in December. \"It's time that this stops,\" she said. \"When are we going to be able to stop marching?\"\n\nAll of this fear is understandable-but it's not equal. High-profile cases aside, policing has never been safer. The rate of officer assaults has been on the decline since the 1990s, and the rate of officer deaths is at its lowest point in a century. \"You're more likely to be murdered simply by living in about half of the largest cities in America than you are while working as a police officer,\" writes journalist Radley Balko.\n\nAnd while black Americans are at greater risk of criminal victimization than they are police violence, it is also true that compared with other Americans, they are more likely to be shot or killed by police , regardless of circumstances. There's also the fact of power. Police officers are empowered by the state to use lethal force, and when that doesn't come with accountability-and in the case of wrongdoing, punishment-it appears arbitrary and frightening. Put differently, most Americans who kill other Americans-including blacks who kill blacks-will face justice. Most cops who kill will not.\n\nWith that said, fear isn't always a bad thing. In the case of the \"black lives matter\" protests, it's been constructive, prompting new calls for police reform and other efforts to improve minority communities. The problem is on the other side, the police side, where fear is an impediment to embracing beneficial reform. In New York City, mild criticism from Mayor Bill de Blasio-following the Eric Garner grand jury decision-sparked a bona fide police rebellion with work stoppages and aggressive, inflammatory rhetoric. At funerals for slain officers-killed by a criminal who claimed Garner and Michael Brown as a cause to commit violence-cops turned their backs on the mayor , shunning his leadership and the city he represents. The problem, besides the illiberalism inherent in the rejection of civil authority, is that de Blasio is on their side . The goal of police reform isn't to punish cops; it's to better connect them to the communities they serve, which makes it easier to fight crime and more likely they'll come home at the end of each day.\n\nThe best example of this is Los Angeles, which completed a major experiment in police reform a few years ago. If the 1992 Los Angeles riots revealed deep tensions and anger toward the LAPD, then the 1999 Rampart scandal -named so after the division in question-unveiled the astounding amount of corruption in the department. An investigation uncovered countless acts of police misconduct involving dozens of officers, from beatings and unprovoked shootings to stealing, drug dealing, evidence planting, and bank robbery. In 2000, the Department of Justice announced it had enough evidence to sue the LAPD for pervasive misconduct, and later that year, the city government entered into a \"consent decree,\" where it agreed to reform the department under supervision from federal courts.\n\nThis was a huge task. As researchers for Harvard University note in a study of the LAPD reforms , \"The fact of federal oversight itself ... can erode morale in a police department, sapping the confidence and spirit that effective policing requires.\" In the first years of the consent decree, officials resisted any changes to their approach. But the result wasn't a more confident police department; it was higher crime and lower morale.\n\nThis changed after Los Angeles brought in new leadership-including current NYPD Police Commissioner Bill Bratton-who embraced the decree. Over the next decade, the LAPD would work to comply with the decree while also reducing crime and improving morale. It was a success. Not only did crime decline over the period of the consent decree, but officer morale rose. The Harvard researchers, for instance, found a marked drop in crime and a decrease in the number of officers who were afraid of being \"punished for an honest mistake\" or having their career \"negatively affected by civilian complaints.\"\n\nWhat's important is that this improvement happened under a policing regime that discouraged the use of force, even as it ramped up enforcement. Under the consent decree, \"The total number of ... force incidents declined by almost 30 percent.\" By 2009, there were fewer officer-involved shootings, chokeholds, head strikes, and suspect hospitalizations than at any point in the previous decade. And while minorities still experience police force out of proportion to their numbers, fewer blacks and Latinos have been subject to force than ever before.\n\nOther, less flashy changes have also been essential to the LAPD's effectiveness. Supervisors and senior officials have been tasked with devising stronger oversight procedures to increase accountability. And critically, there's greater engagement with minority communities, through forums; active recruitment of black, Latino, and Asian officers; and regular activities with schools and other community institutions. The result is a marked increase in the number of Los Angeles residents who say that the police \"treat all racial and ethnic groups fairly,\" from under 40 percent in 2005 to roughly 50 percent in 2009.\n\nThe LAPD is not perfect, but it has improved, and that has made policing better for ordinary citizens and safer for officers themselves. Indeed, for a sense of what happens when police neglect communities, you only have to look east from L.A. to Missouri.\n\nOne of the reasons Ferguson was such a flashpoint was the pre-existing relationship between residents and police. For decades, the citizens of Ferguson and nearby towns were subject to unfair treatment, from targeted stops- used to collect revenue for individual municipalities -to unjustified violence. In 2000, for example, two unarmed men were killed by plainclothes detectives, who later escaped indictment by a grand jury .\n\nThat mistrust doesn't dissipate-it builds. And when an event like the Michael Brown shooting occurs, it can explode into anger and disorder. It almost doesn't matter that the details of Brown's shooting were murky or that key parts of the early narrative were incomplete , impossible to verify, or false -Brown's death was traumatic enough to prompt a huge response from Ferguson residents. At a time when local police needed the trust of the community, they didn't have it.\n\nThe NYPD and so many other police departments are gripped by a fear of criticism and what could happen if it has to bend to change. But there's no reason for fear; reform improved the NYPD in the 1990s, it turned around the LAPD in the 2000s, and it could strengthen New York cops for the next decade. Greater accountability and community contact doesn't harm policing; it makes it better.\n\nIf you're skeptical, consider this: At the same time that Los Angeles burned amid the Rodney King riots, San Diego-just a few hours away- was calm . It's not that there weren't racial tensions or episodes of police brutality, but that for several years-in the wake of San Diego's own King-esque event and the killing of an officer-police had worked with city and community leaders to build bridges and improve policing. When turmoil came, notes Balko , \"those goodwill gestures and the relationships they built paid off,\" and police officials \"could build a strategy around empathy, not antagonism.\"\n\nThe NYPD can continue its strike, and its allies can continue their attacks on reformers. But they're only hurting themselves and the city they serve.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

As reported by THR , the comic will write, direct, and star in I'm a Cop, a film about a depressed, middle-aged man living under the shadow of his ex-cop mother, whose death and legacy force him to become a police officer. Scott Rudin will produce the movie, which looks to be C.K.'s shot at cinematic redemption: The not-so-good Pootie Tang was the last film he directed, and he's been forthright about not being prepared for the task at the time. The rest of his work behind the camera, whether in Louie or the zany Tomorrow Night , betrays a sharp, off-kilter sensibility that will hopefully find its way on screen this time around.\n\nIt's also worth noting that police have been, if not a theme, a recurring motif in C.K.'s work. He played a lovelorn cop in Parks and Recreation , donned a uniform in the hilarious Louie episode \"Heckler/Cop Movie,\" and in this season of Louie said a lot about police brutality despite the episode in question, \"Cop Story,\" not actually having anything to do with police brutality. I'm a Cop seems like a pretty straighforward comedy, but it wouldn't be surprising to see it plumb some darker depths as well.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "I Learned to Think Like a \"Warrior Cop\"\n\nPop quiz! What is the third thing-besides weapons and skills-that you need to survive armed combat? Is it:\n\nA. Ammunition? B. Body armor? C. Tactical advantage? D. The will to kill?\n\nThe answer is D, obviously-or at least it would be obvious if you knew that the question is part of an online course, called \" On Combat ,\" that is steeped in a pseudo-academic field called \"killology,\" and that the instructor and creator, Dave Grossman , is the foremost killologist on the planet. When I decided recently to learn how to be a warrior cop, Grossman's course is where I turned.\n\nI am not a cop and will almost certainly never become one. But earlier this year, I became very interested in understanding how police officers think-how the mindsets they nurture might be related to outcomes such as the killings of Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky, and George Floyd in Minneapolis, and the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin. The nationwide protest movement that erupted in May has called attention to the problem of overaggressive and racist policing in America, raising some very specific questions about police training and threat-assessment methods, situational escalation, and police tolerance of community dissent. In the background of all of this is the ongoing militarization of the American police department. Many cops these days are functionally indistinguishable from soldiers-in terms of the gear they use, the image they project, and the mindset that they embody.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons for this evolution. As Radley Balko writes in his 2013 Rise of the Warrior Cop , much of it has to do with federal incentives for police departments to pursue this country's endless war on drugs. But another answer is that there is a cottage industry of trainers and consultants who encourage police to see their beats as a battlefield.\n\nA retired Army lieutenant colonel with a master's of education in counseling psychology , Dave Grossman is one of America's best-known independent police trainers-and one of the foremost exponents of the \"warrior cop\" mindset. Under the aegis of his Killology Research Group -he defines killology as \"the scholarly study of the destructive act, just as sexology is the scholarly study of the procreative act\"-Grossman travels the country offering continuing-education seminars to cops and cop-adjacents. He musters scientific research, anecdotal evidence, and a boatload of presuppositions in order to prepare his students for the realities of combat, while valorizing the notion that the thin blue line is humanity's last bulwark against total societal collapse.\n\nMany have argued that \"warrior cop\"-style training seminars teach law enforcement officers to start from a place of fear, which can lead them to quickly turn peaceful situations violent. The officer who shot and killed Philando Castile during a 2016 traffic stop in Falcon Heights, Minnesota, had attended a \"Bulletproof Warrior\" course co-taught by Grossman and a colleague, Jim Glennon, two years earlier. Over his career, according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune , that officer had clocked more than 100 hours of trainings on topics such as firearms usage, street survival, and the use of force-but had only attended two hours of deescalation training.\n\nA lot of cops want to hear from Grossman-and so did I. Though I couldn't take one of his in-person courses- Grossman's touring calendar , normally packed with engagements, has been empty since the pandemic began-I decided to spend $79 to take the online version of \"On Combat\" that can be found on his Grossman Academy website (the other courses are \"On Killing\" and \"The Bulletproof Mind\"). The class is divided into eight hourlong units. Each is effectively an enhanced PowerPoint presentation, with Grossman narrating the slides that appear on screen. Occasionally, as a treat, Grossman himself will pop up on screen to tell a story or underscore a point. Each unit ends with a five-question multiple-choice quiz, but the quizzes are not particularly challenging, and students can take them over and over again until they get a passing grade.\n\nI came away with a certificate of completion from Grossman Academy (the o in \"Grossman\" is a rifle sight), an abiding dislike for the term sheepdog , and a much better sense of how and why so many American police officers seem to believe that the streets of America are effectively a war zone-and why the average American police department seems so resistant to reform.\n\nYou can define a police officer's job in a lot of ways: to solve crimes, to maintain order, to help people in need. In the first unit of \"On Combat,\" Grossman characterizes cops as basically like the Avengers, but with more body armor and less public accountability. \"Think about it,\" Grossman says, \"if we went but a single generation without men and women who are willing to go out every day and confront evil, then within the span of that generation we should surely be both damned and doomed.\"\n\nGrossman's America is a terrifying place where police are both the primary targets of and defenders against superpredation. \"Increasingly the police must face organized opponents armed with assault rifles and bombs,\" Grossman says at the outset of the class, citing an \"explosion in violent crime\" and an \"extraordinary rise in violence\" in the streets of America . (The online course bears a copyright date of 2014; many of the incidents that Grossman cites throughout the course happened in the 1990s.) Though many independent sources show that the violent crime rate in America has steadily declined since the early 1990s, Grossman maintains that America is now scarier than ever-and that cops may well be the ones with the most to fear. \"We know that if it were not for all the body armor, bulletproof vests worn by officers, law enforcement fatalities in the United States would easily be double or even triple what they are today,\" Grossman asserts. \"If this is not war, then you tell me what is.\"\n\nWell, war is war: combat waged between states, or states and state-adjacent groups, or states and organized insurrections that hope to topple the state. What Grossman is describing is violent crime, the penalties for which are prescribed by civilian codes of law. But Grossman, who spent decades in the U.S. Army, doesn't just blur the line between soldiers and police officers: He completely erases it.\n\nWhen people talk about military-style policing, they are often referring to the militarized gear and weaponry that many police departments prefer these days: the body armor, the semi-automatic rifles, the armored SWAT Humvees equipped to recapture Fallujah. But the gear is just a symptom of these departments' gradual adoption of the premise that the world is now a theater of war and that battles are most easily won through the liberal use of shock and awe. \"You've probably heard of the Big Bang Theory,\" Grossman says in Unit 2. \"I call this the Bigger Bang Theory, which states that, all other things being equal, in combat, whoever makes the bigger bang wins.\" Combat has clear military connotations, and Grossman's frequent use of the term undergirds the course's martial framing.\n\nGrossman wants cops to develop \"autopilot responses\" so that they will not be caught flat-footed when confronted by an armed suspect. \"Is it possible to see a gun pointed at you, draw your own weapon, and shoot without conscious thought?\" Grossman asks. \"Not only is it possible, in this case it is highly desirable. Of course, his training must be state-of-the-art, so that he knows instantly that the threat is indeed a gun, and not a wallet or a cellphone.\" In practice, many cops have had trouble clearing this threat-assessment barrier.  (\"You shot four bullets into him, sir. He was just getting his license and registration, sir,\" Castile's girlfriend told the cop who shot and killed him.)\n\nGrossman makes sure to clarify that deadly force should be used \"only under the rules of engagement,\" and very few people would disagree with that caveat. But rules of engagement is also a military term, and its usage is just another willful conflation of policing and war. Grossman invokes terrorist attacks, school shootings, and a \"large-scale epidemic of preteen and teenage mass murderers\" who have been trained to kill on \"murder simulator\" video games-he spends a lot of time on this last point, and it is fairly exhausting-in order to argue that your local Officer Friendly should prepare himself to go ahead and unleash his inner G.I. Joe.\n\n\"As a cop, or a peacekeeper, your job is not to kill. It is to serve and protect. To do that, you may have to kill,\" he says in Unit 4. \"The most effective way to stop someone is to fire a bullet into his central nervous system. It is up to God and the paramedics as to whether the man dies. Your job is to stop the deadly threat, and the most effective way to do that is to make the threat die.\" Throughout \"On Combat,\" Grossman is very, very clear that police officers must be ready to manifest the will to kill-and to deal with the aftermath of having done so.\n\n\"On Combat\" borrows from Grossman's book of the same name, which he co-wrote with Loren W. Christensen. In it, Grossman draws on his academic background to break down the neurological, physiological, and emotional responses that participants can expect to experience before, during, and after combat situations. It's true that cops who are better able to control and understand their bodies and emotions while on duty are probably less likely to act recklessly. But Grossman's goal isn't to stop cops from killing; it's to train them to do so more efficiently. To this end, he wants his students to understand how their minds and bodies work so that they can suppress any intrinsic resistance when it's time to pull the trigger.\n\n\"Any natural or learned resistance to killing, any sense of the sanctity of human life, any human emotions, any remorse or compassion at the moment of truth can all be overcome and overwhelmed with training,\" Grossman says in Unit 2. What's more, he says, even a post-traumatic stress reaction can be averted with training. He acknowledges that killing in the line of duty can be very unsettling. He presents a lot of material on how a cop might expect to feel after having done so, and how their colleagues and family can help them process and cope with the experience. Grossman does not deny the reality of PTSD. But he also argues that cops who kill need not be scarred for life by their actions. \"If you do the rationalization and acceptance ahead of time, if you prepare yourself and immerse yourself in the lore and spirit of mature warriors, past and present, then the lawful, legitimate use of deadly force does not have to be a self-destructive or traumatic event,\" Grossman says.\n\nGrossman wants his students to become \"mature warriors\" who can sleep at night untroubled by the bodies they've left in their wake. Though Grossman recently told the Spokane, Washington, Spokesman-Review that the warrior model is not central to his training methods, it was certainly a large part of the course I took, which anyone can take right now. \"We are warriors,\" he says in Unit 1, and the theme recurs throughout the course. Unit 4 literally features a slide of a uniformed cop standing next to a medieval suit of armor, as if to underscore the ostensible link between the paladins of yore and the SWAT teams of today.\n\nGrossman refers to his students as \"sheepdogs,\" battle-ready protectors who are innately responsible for-and tacitly superior to-their noncombatant charges. \"We know that the sheep live in denial; that is what makes them sheep. They do not want to believe that there is evil in the world,\" says Grossman. \"They can accept the fact that fires can happen, which is why they want fire extinguishers, fire sprinklers, fire alarms, and fire exits throughout their kids' schools. But many of them are outraged at the idea of putting an armed police officer in their kids' school.\" (\"On Combat\" doesn't consider whether putting armed cops in schools may well be a solution in search of a problem. There is plenty of evidence to suggest that the presence of armed officers does not serve to deter school shooters or reliably stop shootings in progress.)\n\nBut what recourse do the sheep have when the sheepdog becomes the wolf? The course spends no time acknowledging any of the ways in which cops may abuse their power, and it certainly does not acknowledge the long history of ongoing mistrust between many communities and their police departments. Though I did not expect him to-the name of the course is \"On Combat,\" after all, not \"A People's History of Police Work\"-Grossman does not address the social construction of crime and criminality, or the historically racist coding of \"tough on crime\" policies and rhetoric, or the political origins of this country's endless drug war, or any other factors that might complicate his Manichean thesis. He sees no oppression in the sight of warrior cops forever riding roughshod through \"bad\" neighborhoods like members of an occupying army. He does not stop to consider that treating the \"war on crime\" like an actual war tacitly encourages cops to take less care with the lives of their \"enemies\"-nor does he acknowledge that those disposable lives are all too often Black ones.\n\nWhile Grossman does spend part of Unit 3 discussing the phenomenon of civilians filming on-duty cops, he does so in the course of disparaging the tapers' motives and advancing his \"cops are under siege\" motif: \"Sometimes these videographers do creative editing to make the police look bad and then take the doctored videotape to the media.\" Grossman has little use for the media. \"Do the media people know that they are hurting people? Of course. They even admit it. Do they care? Apparently not,\" Grossman says in Unit 6. \"We are dealing with an industry functioning at the moral level of drug dealers; in fact, one of their objectives is to convince us to legalize drugs.\" He also blames violent video games and entertainment products as prime factors in America's alleged decline and fall-an argument you hear often from gun proponents looking for an alternative explanation for shootings. \"Violent video games are murder simulators,\" he says, \"except when police officers and soldiers use them for training, in which case they are combat simulators.\"\n\nTo Grossman, who makes much of school shootings as the proving grounds for game-addled, kill-crazed teens, the difference is clear. To others, the difference between \"murder\" and \"combat\" might not be so obvious. In 2019, according to Education Week , eight people in America were killed in a school shooting; 35 people were killed that way in 2018. But 999 people in America were shot and killed by the police in 2019, according to the Washington Post , and in 2018, 990 people were killed that way. Even if 95 percent of these deadly police shootings were unquestionably justifiable, the body count of the remaining 5 percent would still be higher than the body count from the school shootings that Grossman repeatedly cites as proof that it's war out there.\n\nBut the streets of America are not a war zone. Police work is not combat. Cops are not soldiers. Property damage is not a capital offense, Black men and women are not targets for shooting practice, and Americans demanding police reform are not tantamount to some fifth column of saboteurs. In the wake of the Floyd case and other incidents, communities across America are asking their police departments to reconsider their roles and responsibilities, to pursue demilitarization, and to learn to deescalate the dangerous situations that they too often create.\n\nGrossman has not, as far as I can tell, gone on record with his thoughts about this summer's police reform movement. But in recent years, his style of trainings has seen a backlash from municipalities that now find them troubling, as well as a counterbacklash from police officials who seemingly can't get enough of the \"will to kill.\" When Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey banned warrior cop-style courses in 2019, the local police union offered to pay for any cop who wanted to take one. When a woman in Spokane, Washington, launched a petition earlier this year to urge the county sheriff's office to cancel an upcoming \"mindset bootcamp\" seminar from Grossman, the sheriff vowed that the course would go on as planned. \"I am tired of being bullied by political rights and left,\" the sheriff told the Spokesman-Review ; earlier this month, he told a local television station that the opposition was spearheaded by \"a group of progressive socialist[s]\" who are \"actually promoting a lie about the training.\"\n\nYou want to know the truth about the training? Take it from me, a proud holder of a certificate of completion from Grossman Academy: \"On Combat\" teaches its students to fear and resent the people they serve, to willfully mistake this contempt for bravery, and to believe that heroism is conferred by the barrel of a smoking gun. This philosophy, as manifested by the countless police officers and officials who subscribe to it, is and will continue to be one of the foremost impediments to meaningful efforts at police reform in towns across America. \"If we do not keep the warrior in the mix, we become glorified social workers with guns,\" Grossman says very early in \"On Combat\"-and even if that's what the communities whose taxes pay their salaries want from their police officers, Grossman implies that it is those officers' patriotic duty to resist.\n\n\"In this dark hour, our mission is to rise up and nurture the next generation of warriors,\" Grossman says at the very end of the course, his words illustrated by a photograph of a cop standing in the middle of a city street. The cop's arms are crossed. He wears mirrored sunglasses, a baseball cap that says \"POLICE,\" and a resolute half-smirk on his face, as if daring the sheep and wolves alike to try to move him off his spot.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

We view freedom as freedom from guns, freedom from debt due to illness or education, and freedom from schools that preach ignorance and conformity.\n\nI'm a black ex-cop, and this is the real truth about race and policing\n\nOur politics put us in a minority among my husband's fellow police officers and their families.

Unloading the magazine and removing the bullet from chamber, putting a trigger lock on and, locking the safe doesn't take more than 30 seconds.\n\nNone of our children has ever touched or held my husband's duty weapon.

In 21 years, he has only fired his weapon on the range.\n\nIf any of the children choose to become police officers, they can learn to shoot at academy, or they can go to the range after they turn 18 with their father if they are curious. So far, neither of the kids who have already turned 18 has shown an iota of interest in a weapon, and I am secure in what I consider successful parenting.\n\nThey are all strong, smart, able to start a fire without a match, change a tire and the oil on their cars as applicable, throw a punch, make a splint, and catch and clean a fish; they have enough AP credits between the older two of the four to have earned a degree. Our family motto is taken from a Robert Heinlein quote: \"Specialization is for insects.\"\n\nWe are fortunate to live in a large suburb with superior schools, houses maintained either professionally or by dedicated DIYers; our demographics skew toward mostly four-year college graduates with a significant percentage holding advanced degrees. Our police department is funded well enough for the officers to not only afford to live in town but purchase their own homes here, and they are encouraged to do so. So we did.\n\nHowever, a town that is able to pay patrol officers six-figure incomes demand the excellence that comes along with that expenditure. Our town puts forth an image of harmonious multiculturalism, and there is a zero-tolerance policy for any officer who displays racist or sexist behaviors either on or off the clock. Their ticketing and arrest statistics are analyzed constantly. They were early backseat, dashboard, and body camera adopters.\n\nThere are rigorous prescreening standards for the pool of officer hopefuls, and even after four out of a pool of a thousand applicants are accepted as trainees, the individual psychological, physical, and didactic training is intense. The continuing education is evidence-based and a yearly requirement.\n\nThe policymakers in the department and township are open to change as the science evolves. This culminates in a culture where officers are taught to think flexibly, quickly, and fairly.\n\nDue to the zero-tolerance policy in the department my husband works for, it's very rare for someone to make it past the initial psychological evaluation if they are even slightly biased in a way that could reflect poorly on the community.\n\nThis multiple-part test - oral, written, and small panel interview - is given over a course of a few weeks throughout the testing process. I'm sure it's even been refined in the 22 years since we went through the process.\n\nIt's draining, but so is standing on the witness stand having to explain your course of action to a grand jury, a judge, a lawyer, your boss, your spouse, parents, and children.\n\nAs in real life as well as \"cop life,\" there is a huge disparity among police departments throughout the country. Small municipalities that pay their officers $12 an hour and require a GED provide their officers with minimal training in comparison to what I explained above, and their pool of applicants is limited by both pay and location. Anyone worthy of better has already left the area. These are not people who wish to understand the concept of meta-analysis and probably mock those who do.\n\nMany people demand that the person who educates their child to carry advanced degrees but do not wish to contribute to the additional training and continuing education for the person who may have to make a split second decision whether or not to kill their child.\n\nI don't know about you, but I want someone who has studied and been screened and trained and reviewed and trained some more before even being allowed a weapon.\n\nLiberals are correct about the fact that cops don't want to talk to them about the decision-making process that led them to act or not act in any given situation. They have the reason completely wrong. Officers don't want to speak for \"all cops,\" because \"all cops\" are not hired, paid, or trained equally. They also may be prevented from doing so by departmental policy or legally depending on the situation.\n\nPolice officers have no choice but to go and confront what is presented, under chaotic conditions, expected to react in a split second and to do so each and every time in a way deemed perfect by someone examining it from the comfort of a chair with all the background information. That is why courts give cops the benefit of the doubt.\n\nWhite people, don't tell me what Martin Luther King would think of Black Lives Matter\n\nThat is why they don't even bother explaining when the outrage occurs when a police officer is not charged with a crime, when all the information is gathered and it is perceived as \"closing ranks\" or a \"good old boys' club.\"\n\nAn officer has to make a life-changing decision in a frighteningly short amount of time when the world is ending around everyone involved. This is why I relax when I hear the Velcro. This is why I have tried and failed to somehow defend the fact that my husband is not some sort of sociopathic monster.\n\nCops like my husband are exhausted by the amateur lawyers with 20/20 hindsight who feel they would do better at making a decision in an eighth of a second after they spent a few hours rewinding and replaying the video. Plenty of video is replayed and analyzed and picked apart frame by frame in a professional continuing education setting; the experienced 20/20 hindsight analysis by fellow professionals will be productive and contribute to the cognitive process that has to happen in a life-or-death situation.\n\nThey take this additional knowledge they gain from the input of their colleagues and superiors and trainers and continue to head in the direction of chaos and trouble, to save you or someone you love without checking to see if you have favorable opinions about the police.\n\nOn Friday morning, my husband sat on the edge of our bed and said, \"Don't check your Twitter feed or your Facebook page yet. There was a sniper in Dallas that killed five police officers.\"\n\nI didn't wake up a widow on Friday. I say this with a heavy heart and the weight of so many families, those of the Dallas five, the Sterling family, and the Castile family as well. To be human is to mourn life in such a terrible and senseless way. I blame the guns, not the cops. I look to my representatives in the federal government whom I trusted to keep people safe, and I ask them why.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nEarly Hollywood treated the cops as incompetent fools. Then everything changed.\n\nby Constance Grady\n\nIn 2019, polls found that the police were one of the most trusted public institutions in America , more trustworthy than Congress or journalists or religious leaders.\n\nBut in 2020, after George Floyd died at the hands of police and wave of protests against police brutality spread across the US, police drove their vans into crowds of protesters , shot paint canisters at people standing on their own porches, fired rubber bullets at reporters and arrested other reporters live on television , and pulled down protesters' masks to pepper spray them in the face in the midst of a respiratory pandemic.\n\nThere is a gap between the ways in which the police behave and the ways in which the public perceives them. And for a long time, police have behaved as though they think pop culture is responsible for that gap.\n\nIn 1910, the International Association of Chiefs of Police was moved to adopt a resolution condemning the movie business for the way it depicted police officers . The movies, the IACP complained, made crime look fun and glamorous. Meanwhile, the police were \"sometimes made to appear ridiculous.\"\n\nIt was true: The movies did tend to make the police look ridiculous in the 1910s. From 1912 to 1917, the incompetent Keystone Cops bumbled their way across the silent screen. From 1914 to 1918, animated Police Dog shorts showed a police force unable to prevent adorable Officer Piffles (a good dog) from getting his owner into one scrape after another. And in 1917's Easy Street , Charlie Chaplin's tramp-turned-police-officer was only able to save his girl from a mob of criminals after accidentally sitting on a drug addict's needle and picking up superpowers from the force of the inadvertent injection.\n\nPolice in popular culture of the 1910s were inept buffoons to be mocked and, well, ridiculed. And the real-life police reacted with outrage. How could the police do their jobs if people thought of them as losers who could be foiled by a cartoon dog?\n\nToday, the police of popular culture have no such problem. Our screens are filled with depictions of heroic cop after heroic cop. We've got reactionary heroic cops and liberal heroic cops ; white heroic cops and Black heroic cops ; heroic cops who will work outside the system when the situation calls for it and never face a problem because they are always right, and heroic cops who never have to work against the system because the system itself is always right.\n\nWe live in a world in which police frequently respond to peaceful protesters with tear gas and rubber bullets. We also live in a world in which the heroic police officer is one of our culture's default protagonists . And the police are our protagonists because they put in the work to become so.\n\nThe ridiculous police of 1910s pop culture didn't come out of nowhere. The police of the late 19th and early 20th centuries were widely understood to be a corrupt gang, and not without reason. The infamous Lexow Commission of the 1890s, which ran more than 10,000 pages long, found that the police extorted $10 million from the public each year in New York State alone, and that they regularly harassed the citizenry rather than trying to protect them. That report drove 30 years of police reform efforts and gave a young Theodore Roosevelt the chance to build his reputation on cleaning up the New York City Police Department - but for much of the public, the police's reputation as a pack of hired goons at worst and incompetent bumblers at best had already been set.\n\nDecades of reform helped change the public's perception of the police. But it also helped that the movie industry, eager to escape police censorship, began to police itself. Studios needed police cooperation to cover up their stars' misdeeds. They also needed to get shooting permits. They had plenty of motivation to play nicely with the police. So the policeman as incompetent bumbler began to fade away from the movies.\n\nBut what cemented the idea of the hero cop in the American imagination was the modern cop show, starting with 1951's Dragnet . And as many critics have already shown - including, notably, Alyssa Rosenberg in her in-depth study at the Washington Post - the modern cop show was the result of a close relationship between Hollywood and the police.\n\nThe premise of Dragnet was that it was revealing to the world the authentic truth of what it is like to be a police officer, fighting crime. \"Ladies and gentlemen, the story you are about to see is true,\" showrunner, star, and narrator Jack Webb promised at the beginning of every episode. And as Webb's character, the stalwart LAPD detective Joe Friday, went about his work, he was surrounded by real cop cars and real cops acting as extras in the background of his scenes. Famously, the LAPD checked Webb's scripts for authenticity.\n\nBut as Rosenberg laid out , the LAPD's help came at a cost. Webb submitted every script to the LAPD's Public Information Division for approval before shooting, and any element they disliked, he would scrap.\n\nThe politics of Webb's Dragnet were not neutral. \"What Dragnet offered the American public,\" as the pop culture scholar Roger Sabin writes in his book Cop Shows , \"was a vision of the police force as a 'stabilizer' in society, made up of honest men (mostly men) dedicated both to keeping the bad guys in their place, and to the more abstract values of law and order.\" Dragnet presented the police to the public the way the police wanted to be seen: as aspirational heroes.\n\nIn 1951, the same year that Dragnet premiered, multiple members of the LAPD assaulted seven civilians , leaving five Latino men and two white men hospitalized with broken bones and ruptured organs. Racially motivated violence against civilians was and still is part of the reality of the police force. But Webb and his collaborators at the LAPD deliberately elided that reality, giving us the fantasy of the hero cop instead.\n\nAfter the success of Dragnet , law enforcement departments across the country began setting up eager collaborations with Hollywood, ready to shape the narrative of the police officer in the public's eyes. Highway Patrol followed quickly in its footsteps, and then F.B.I. , Columbo , Hawaii Five-0 , Hill Street Blues , and the mothership: Law & Order and all the series it would spawn. Today, it's de rigueur for cop shows to have cop experts on consult, ready to apply a patina of authenticity to the stories Hollywood tells us about police.\n\nIt is also de rigueur for some of the 21st century's cop shows to argue that there are serious problems in contemporary police forces. Not all cop shows choose to critique their systems: Law & Order and its various spinoffs tend to place their unfailing trust in the system. CBS's Blue Bloods aired an episode in 2014 in which a Black suspect throws himself out of a third-floor window to frame a blameless white officer for police brutality, the implication being that criticisms of the existing system do nothing but make life easier for criminals and harder for our heroic boys in blue.\n\nBut the 21st-century police shows that tend to be highly critically acclaimed and beloved by liberal audiences, like Brooklyn Nine-Nine and The Wire , do try to use their police expertise to critique the institutions in which they take place. The Wire features sympathetic individual cops, but it also depicts police brutality against sympathetic and well-developed civilians, and it argues that police departments are structured to encourage that brutality. And Brooklyn Nine-Nine develops much of its conflict by pitting its well-meaning progressive protagonist cops against the more conservative members of the NYPD.\n\nNot coincidentally, The Wire was considered wildly ahead of its time when it debuted in 2002, especially compared to the traditional police procedurals populating network television both then and now. And by the time Brooklyn Nine-Nine premiered in 2013, gentle criticism of the police as an institution felt like more or less what a respectable liberal viewer could expect from a respectable liberal TV show. The idea that a police show was inherently incapable of being politically progressive barely registered in mainstream criticism. When the journalist and academic Steven Thrasher suggested as much in 2018 , calling Brooklyn Nine-Nine \"some GOOD propaganda,\" he faced widespread backlash.\n\nBut regardless of whether a police show codes itself as conservative or progressive, the police officer is always the protagonist. He might be troubled, she might be working within a corrupt system and trying to change it from within, but it is always through their eyes that we see the world. And that's because the police built the genre that we use to talk about them. So today, even shows that are trying to self-reflexively critique the inherent flaws of the cop show find themselves doing so using the framework that the police built.\n\nIt's for that reason that some actors who have played police officers, including Brooklyn Nine-Nine 's Stephanie Beatriz , began publicly donating to bail relief funds for protesters as calls to defund the police came to dominate headlines in 2020. The donations were an act of restitution for making their living by glamorizing cops.\n\n(Notably, at least one figure associated with a less-progressive police show had the opposite reaction. A writer from S.W.A.T. and Chicago P.D. was fired from then-forthcoming Law & Order spinoff Law & Order: Organized Crime for making social media posts that jokingly threatened protesters.)\n\nPart of the central joke of Brooklyn Nine-Nine is that Andy Samberg's character Jake is obsessed with '70s detective procedurals and that he became a detective because he wanted to be the star of his own TV show. But Jake isn't any different from the rest of white America in the way he sees the world. We all grew up on cop shows. And we all reflexively know that when we are presented with a cop story, the cop is the hero.\n\nPushing back against such a deeply ingrained cultural understanding is difficult. Samberg himself acknowledged as much when he told People in July 2020 that he and the cast and creative team of Brooklyn Nine-Nine were \"all in touch and kind of discussing how you make a comedy show about police right now, and if we can find a way of doing that that we all feel morally okay about.\" Samberg's co-star Terry Crews had previously said that four unproduced episodes of Brooklyn Nine-Nine had been scrapped and would be rewritten . At the time, the show was between seasons; in February 2021, not long before it went back into production, news broke that its upcoming eighth season will be its last .\n\nIn the months since the George Floyd protests, different police procedurals have taken different paths in wrestling with this new narrative of the cop show as copaganda. Law & Order: SVU featured an episode where Olivia Benson has to face the question of whether or not she unconsciously racially profiled a suspect. Cops was outright canceled (it went back into production last fall to fulfill overseas obligations). CBS has brought in criminal justice reform advocates to work as consultants on its many police procedurals, in the same way that cop shows have traditionally used police officers as consultants.\n\nAnd police officers have reacted to this development in much the same way they did to the Keystone Cops a century ago: with outrage. The new CBS shows \"will be stories engineered to further diminish public opinion of police officers,\" Patrick Lynch, the president of the Police Benevolent Association of the City of New York, told the Washington Post last fall .\n\nBut if working with new consultants appreciably changes the cop show, it will only be the latest change in a long and fraught evolution.\n\nCop shows are where America thinks about how we see the police and how we would like to see them. These shows are shaped by our beliefs about the police, and they shape our beliefs in turn. A summer of watching police respond violently to protests against police brutality necessarily changed the way thousands of Americans think about the police - and that, in turn, means the cop shows will have to change, too.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nHow Kristi Noem and Karoline Leavitt offer two visions of conservative femininity.\n\nDJs, club owners, and patrons alike say there's way too much standing around.\n\nAstrology's enormous appeal, explained for believers and skeptics.\n\nThe surprising truth about milk is hiding in plain sight.\n\n﻿From Dunkin' deodorant to Sabrina Carpenter perfume, smelling good isn't enough - it's all about smelling edible.\n\nA star-studded film explains the hope and hype behind regenerative agriculture.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nOn being a Black child used as pro-cop propaganda.\n\nby Arriel Vinson\n\nEditor's note: This piece includes descriptions of gun violence.\n\nIt's September, and Jacob Blake was almost murdered. He was shot seven times by a Kenosha, Wisconsin, cop who tried to detain him. Last month, I could have replaced that name with a different Black person's. I could have done the same the month before.\n\nI scroll through my Twitter timeline and see outrage, but I also see viral videos of cops dancing with protesters, or kneeling , or hugging them just moments before knocking an eye out of its socket. The video I see most is of National Guard officers in combat gear doing the Macarena in Atlanta. My followers mostly retweet to critique, but underneath those retweets, I see replies saying that these moments are special, heartwarming. That these images of cops and protesters holding up their fists side by side are what America needs right now.\n\nMoments like these - where I witness both revolution and the gross but subtle attempts to keep it from looking like one - remind me of my first experience with the police where I unwittingly participated in pro-police propaganda. As I've grown and my understanding of my place as a Black woman in this world has sharpened, I look back at this experience with an uncomfortable recognition of how my Blackness was being used.\n\nIf I told you I remembered exactly when I stopped trusting the police, I'd be lying. I'm sure the distrust trickled down to me the way secrets and traditions do. I'm sure, like every young Black person does, I just observed or overheard it and realized, eventually, people were right.\n\nMaybe my childhood low-income apartment complex taught me. We were a neighborhood full of parents, siblings, everyone Black. We were a neighborhood that came alive in the summer. We left our bikes in the yard or in the middle of the street or on our neighbor's porch so he could fix it. We chased down the ice cream truck, chased down coins to buy something, sold lemonade, made no money, tried again the next day.\n\nWith all that commotion, police would, of course, drive through the neighborhood frequently. They'd inch down each side of the complex as if they were observing every single one of us, every centimeter of our skin. Some of us would stay where we were, unbothered, waiting for a challenge. But most of my neighbors, because they knew danger would come, scattered.\n\nWhen I was about 11 or 12 years old, I was selected to participate in Indianapolis's annual Shop With a Cop program, hosted by the Indianapolis Fraternal Order of Police Lodge #86 . I wasn't old enough to know that Black people often got killed by police. But I was old enough to recognize that in my neighborhood, when you saw cops, you abandoned the outdoors and went back inside. I was also old enough to keep some things to myself - to know not to tell my friends or others in the neighborhood that I'd be on an all-day excursion with a cop.\n\nShop With a Cop brings together Marion County police officers from 11 departments to take \"needy children from all over the Indianapolis community\" shopping for the winter holidays. It's a day-long event, complete with a movie showing, meals, and a trip to Walmart or Meijer to shop for more expensive winter needs - or whatever you may point at and ask for. The PR pitch from a police perspective is that it's a time to give back and to give low-income children a positive police experience . Last December, the Indianapolis program assisted about 350 families ; it boasts the largest Shop With a Cop program in the country, with many other cities having a similar program.\n\nThough the holidays were always hard for us, that winter seemed different. My mom had applied for Christmas help all over the city, and after completing the paperwork and meeting income guidelines, I was chosen. The same winter I participated, a family also sponsored me through another, non-police-related Christmas program - getting as much as they could off my mom's wish list, which included a few toys and some clothes, since the police department was covering the winter coat and other necessities.\n\nWhat I remembered about my Shop With a Cop experience was that I went with a white male cop to Walmart and the movie theater afterward. What my mom told me, when I checked more than 15 years later, was that I went with a Black woman cop. My mom said she probably wouldn't have let me go had it been a white male cop, but the Black woman made her feel comfortable. The cop pulled up, according to my mom, and came into the apartment to chat with both her and my grandmother. I remember being quiet, just waiting to get the day over with.\n\nWhat I didn't tell my mom, revisiting this conversation as an adult, was that the police department sending someone who looked like us was by design. I didn't tell her that all those years later, learning it was a Black cop instead of a white cop didn't soothe me. I had learned too much about my Blackness and our history, and had protested for too many Black people who had been wrongfully killed by police to be comforted. I didn't mention that the sole purpose of sending a Black cop to our Black neighborhood was to ease us into comfort. That it was all for aesthetics - if we see a seemingly nice Black cop, we believe, even if we've experienced differently, that there is some good in a system that was created with the intent to harm us.\n\nI decided not to bring it back up to my mom because I'm sure she already knows all of this, even if she doesn't have the words for it.\n\nEarly teens, the beginning of high school maybe. My best friends and I attended the Indiana Black Expo Summer Celebration - an annual, almost two-week event of exhibits, performances, and activities - in downtown Indianapolis that we saved our small allowances over for months. We didn't have money for the actual events planned by the organization, only enough to give our parents gas money, buy some food while we walked around, and possibly buy an item from one of the exhibits in the convention center.\n\nIt was a Saturday evening. The sun set, the downtown sidewalks got more packed, and we stood in front of a Steak 'n Shake trying to decide what to do next. The officers rode on horses, galloping down the road, towering over every Black kid in Indianapolis who could find a ride or was old enough to catch public transit.\n\nI guess we stood for too long. I guess the officer who approached us didn't like my friend's tone. I guess he thought she was old enough, Black enough to slam into the restaurant's wall, her cheek bunching up and mouth still open. I guess he thought one less of us was better.\n\nHe packed her into a paddy wagon along with plenty of other Black teens. I don't know if we yelled or told the officer to stop. What I know is we were powerless. What I know is my first personal experience with the police was shopping, and that was physically harmless. What I know is when you're Black, you never know when it'll be your time, at what age they'll stop performing kindness and start performing hate.\n\nAfter the introductions at my apartment, the cop and I got into the car to start our shopping excursion. As we drove, she turned on the sirens like she was supposed to. What might have been exciting for other children wasn't exciting for me, but triggering to the sounds I often heard in my neighborhood and the fear that arose when they did. I sank down in my seat until we got to the store.\n\nThroughout the experience, I don't remember saying much. I remember being excited that I could get a coat. I remember not loving the movie we saw. But what I remember vividly is the nagging feeling I had, the urge to keep looking around the store and the mostly empty, dark theater to see if anyone was watching me. If any white people assumed I was some no-good Black kid, since I was sitting with a cop and many Black kids my age had already had run-ins with the justice system. If any Black people around me worried that I was in danger for the same reason.\n\nThat whole day, I couldn't shake the feeling that everything - getting into the police car in my neighborhood, being seen at the Walmart - could expose me to ridicule from my neighbors and friends. I was maybe too young to fully understand why they would tease me, but my neighbors knew something I didn't: The police may act like they want to support low-income, Black communities, but everything I was participating in was for show.\n\nThe experience was supposed to be a positive one, but, in the end, nothing about Shop With a Cop made me any less wary of police. Even back then, I understood it was transactional: I was there for the items I needed but couldn't afford. I knew deep down that cops had opinions about me or my neighborhood or my family, even if I couldn't articulate it.\n\nAs far as I know, I never saw the Black woman cop again. White officers were the only ones I saw in the neighborhood from then on.\n\nWhen the protests in response to George Floyd's murder began, my Twitter timeline was full of Black people tweeting about their first negative encounter with cops. They were 11 years old, or 13, 14, 16. Older if they were lucky. But most of them weren't lucky. Most of them had already been slammed onto the sidewalk by police officers at a young age, for being, for existing. Most of them figured out quickly what streets to avoid, what neighborhoods didn't want them around, what stores they'd get followed in. Sometimes, if we time it right, we can avoid the cops. We can live and they'll let us. Unless we jut outside of invisible lines, boundaries unknown to anyone but them.\n\nFrom the time I went to Black Expo as a teen to the times I ignored that we had officers in our public schools but the other schools didn't, the time I participated in a die-in at Indiana University, the time Michael Brown was murdered and I protested and Alton Sterling was murdered and I protested and George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, Dreasjon Reed, and Tony McDade were murdered and I protested, I was forced to learn that Black people weren't the target audience for protecting and serving.\n\nPrograms like Shop With a Cop are masterful propaganda. Just like the \"good cop\" images floating around the internet and on the news, they serve to make cops look good. Officers can point at these programs when challenged about what they're doing for low-income, Black communities, or when they kill a Black person. For some Black people, I imagine, these programs keep them conflicted about whether or not all cops are \"bad,\" even though a system designed to destroy us can be nothing but. And I guess that's the point.\n\nBut for me, the few programs offered to \"needy children\" via the Indianapolis police weren't enough to prepare me, or make me accept, the state violence inflicted on Black people. When you have no choice but to accept assistance from institutions and systems that will inflict harm on you and people who look like you, you realize how much state violence resembles an abusive partner. They perform affection and support, then harm you. Then do it again and harm you, just to make sure you need them enough.\n\nArriel Vinson is a Tin House Winter Workshop alumna and Hoosier who writes about being young, Black, and in search of freedom.

There are so many cop shows, and most of them depict police officers as brave, stalwart heroes. It's inevitable that the idea of the police as effective guardians of the public, constantly and selflessly putting themselves in harm's way, would leak out into the national subconscious.\n\nLawler argues that we must consider this portrait of police in any complete discussion of representation on TV:\n\nWhen we talk about representation in movies and television, we often point at the voices and faces that are missing. But we also need to look at the voices and faces that are overrepresented. Too often police are beacons of morality who never do wrong. Too often criminals are people of color, particularly black men. Too often victims are forgettable and laws optional when you carry a badge and a gun.\n\nAaron Rahsaan Thomas, the showrunner of CBS's S.W.A.T. and one of the few black people to ever showrun a broadcast network TV series about the police, proposed a slightly different course of action in a piece he wrote for Vanity Fair : Find ways to change the perspectives TV brings to the police by varying the sorts of people who write about them.\n\nWhen I hear Hollywood colleagues playfully pondering whether or not we're doing enough to address the image of the hero cop that has been entrenched as a procedural staple, the answer is clear: hell fucking no. There's a ton of work we still have to do. The question is, how sincere will we be about putting in that work? Right now, individuals and corporations are offering lip service to preserve business, using statements to indicate support for black people. The real test, as always, is: what actions will we see?\n\nOne thing seems likely to me: Hollywood is not going to give up on the cop show. Stories about police are an instant, ready-made drama generator. Crimes are often committed, investigated, and solved in the space of a single hour, in ways that distort our views of how police departments actually work and how effective they are, but otherwise offer a reliable, time-tested narrative structure. Hollywood loathes giving up something that works, and lots of people love watching police procedurals and other cop shows.\n\nBut already, change is evident. Two (heavily edited) reality shows about the lives of police officers - Live PD and Cops - have been canceled, and the TV industry at large is at least asking big, important questions: How do we make cop shows without needlessly valorizing the police? Can we? Should we? The answers will drive the next several decades of TV storytelling and maybe even change how we think about the police in the US.\n\nOne of the problems with the cop show is central to the way television works. TV cannot help but normalize what it portrays because we spend so much time watching any given TV show that its circumstances become more and more mundane to us. This is why so many TV shows tend to drastically raise their stakes the longer a series runs - to jar us out of complacency, the show has to find ways to shock us all over again.\n\nConsider the medical drama Grey's Anatomy. When the show began in 2005, it certainly had moments of extreme crisis (a train accident! a bomb in the hospital!), but they were few and far between because the real drama came from the way the characters interacted and the soapy complications therein. But as the seasons wore on, Grey's , like so many medical dramas before it, had to find new ways to make the world of medicine seem fresh and exciting again. There were shooters in the hospital and plane crashes and other huge disasters. The escalation wasn't entirely the show's fault; it's just how long-running TV works. In order to not become complacent, to not so normalize their every facet that the audience becomes inured to them, TV shows turn to bigger and bigger tricks.\n\nBut the creep of normalization can still create problems for an entire genre of TV. I think that's what's happened to the cop show, where an organization with substantial problems in our reality is mostly treated as a bastion of noble heroics in TV reality because TV has so thoroughly internalized an idea of unchecked police power.\n\nFor instance, the series NYPD Blue , which ran from 1994 to 2006 and broke new ground for adult subject matter on broadcast TV, featured a racist, anger-prone detective named Andy Sipowicz at its center. The show didn't celebrate Andy, but because he was portrayed by the mesmerizing Dennis Franz, viewers couldn't help but be drawn to him all the same. Within a few seasons, people were so used to Andy that the show had to resort to more and more brazen ways to karmically punish him - seemingly everyone he had ever known died horrible deaths - as if trying to remind viewers that, actually, Andy did some terrible things.\n\nThe classic way to subtweet the cop drama, at least structurally, has typically been the private eye show. Private investigators operate outside of the justice system, which means they're often as much at odds with law enforcement as they are with people breaking the law. The classic example of the form is the 1970s drama The Rockford Files (where James Garner played the ultimate cool dad of a PI); more recently, the ABC series Stumptown , which just finished its first season, has also told involving mysteries outside the trappings of the traditional cop show format.\n\nThere have been other attempts to break open the cop show mold in recent years. By far the most famous of these is The Wire , David Simon's sprawling depiction of the many organizations and systems rotting away in the city of Baltimore. The show featured a new mystery each season, to be solved by a team of detectives and other officers, but its message was that it's impossible to be wholly good in a broken system. The morals of The Wire 's many police officer characters ranged from basically decent to hopelessly corrupt, but the show always drove home that even the best of them couldn't help but be eaten alive by the self-interested, reflexively defensive institution they all worked for.\n\nThe issue with The Wire is that it's brilliant television, but it's also the kind of show that is dense and multifaceted, with lots and lots of subtleties that are best revealed during close watches. It's not exactly high-octane entertainment, and that's okay - it's not trying to be. But that necessarily limits the show's audience. You have to really, really want to watch The Wire to watch it. You're not just going to stumble upon reruns on TNT some night.\n\nTo find a modern drama that doesn't needlessly valorize the police while still being wildly entertaining, we'll have to go overseas.\n\nIf there's a common throughline to shows like The Wire and The Rockford Files , it's a distrust of institutions, which have a tendency to decay from within. Thus, the two shows have something in common with a very different - but still deeply American - form of detective drama: the film noir .\n\nAs something of a catchall term, \"film noir\" has been applied to several movies and TV shows over the years. Film noir stories are usually about characters who investigate crimes, characters who are sometimes but not always police officers. The genre is defined by a sense of systemic fatalism: the realization that the crime being investigated is far more complicated, with much deeper roots, than most people could have imagined. The good guys might capture a patsy or two, but when the time comes to round up the real bad guys, said bad guys are protected by a hideously corrupt system. For examples of the form, think of The Maltese Falcon , Chinatown , True Detective , or even Who Framed Roger Rabbit .\n\nFilm noir's inherent structure exists to expose institutional rot. In almost every film noir, the hero is a good cop or a good detective, but the story makes clear that every other law enforcement officer is either hopelessly corrupt, hopelessly evil, or completely inept (sometimes, they're all three). Most film noir argues, in essence, that most cops are bad, and the handful of good ones are completely unprepared to take down the true villains, who sit at the top of a system built primarily to benefit them. You can see where this might be the best way to combine the visceral thrills of a cop show with the weightier consideration of the police's position in society, as our modern era demands.\n\nWhat's remarkable is that there's already one show that's doing this, albeit a show from Germany. The series Babylon Berlin , which debuted in 2018 and now has three seasons available to stream on Netflix, sometimes feels like an attempt to blend The Wire , Mad Men , and Lost into one series, then play it at 1.5 speed. Set in 1929 Berlin, with the rise of the Nazis just over the horizon, it follows the hopelessly noble Gereon Rath and the agreeably stubborn Charlotte Ritter, two of those good-but-ineffective cops so familiar to the film noir genre, as they attempt to solve murders, robberies, and acts of high treason all while missing the horrible monster just waiting to emerge. (The way this series teases out Nazi iconography across its first three seasons is one of its best elements.)\n\nThroughout Babylon Berlin 's three seasons to date, Gereon and Charlotte have their wins here and there, but their victories tend to be quixotic. They might solve a crime, then be unable to bring the perpetrators to justice because the perpetrators are protected by their power within the systems that govern German society. They consistently find the truth but are powerless to do anything about it. And all the while, the Nazis are coming to power, with everyone in the police force missing what's happening under their very noses.\n\nIn the show's season three finale, Charlotte, lamenting yet another miscarriage of justice among so many, says to Gereon, \"We did this.\" By \"we,\" she means Gereon and her specifically, but also more generally the police. If the police are only going to arrest those with less power and never work to dismantle oppressive systems, they will be corrupted and manipulated by those very systems. And right down the hall, one of the pair's colleagues is talking about reining in Berlin's criminal underground - even as we in the audience know the real threat is about to set the country aflame with hatred.\n\nBabylon Berlin is a dense and beautifully layered show, but it's also just a lot of fun. Every season is crammed full of big twists, bigger reveals, musical numbers, romantic rendezvous, and action sequences. Yet at every turn, the series underlines the idea that even its heroes operate from a single-minded self-interest that prevents them from adequately recognizing and fighting against the rise of fascism.\n\nThis theme has resonance in our times, but also in every time. While some of the strange cocktail that makes Babylon Berlin work is its period setting - it's easier to realize how badly the \"good cops\" are screwing up when you know that their failures will spur the rise of the Nazis - the show has many lessons for American television about telling stories about failed institutions and the people struggling to work within those institutions.\n\nWe're living in a moment where, paradoxically, there are more horrible crimes to investigate than ever before, but the organizations we've built to ensure that justice is served are ill-equipped to actually do so. And in a world that feels as if it's falling apart in new ways with each passing day, we need investigators like those in film noir, investigators who solve crimes but are still powerless to stop them.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nHow Kristi Noem and Karoline Leavitt offer two visions of conservative femininity.\n\nDJs, club owners, and patrons alike say there's way too much standing around.\n\nAstrology's enormous appeal, explained for believers and skeptics.\n\nThe surprising truth about milk is hiding in plain sight.\n\n﻿From Dunkin' deodorant to Sabrina Carpenter perfume, smelling good isn't enough - it's all about smelling edible.\n\nA star-studded film explains the hope and hype behind regenerative agriculture.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\n\"We are the action arm for a fucked-up national mindset\": A CIA officer turned cop speaks out.\n\nby Ezra Klein\n\nPatrick Skinner spent a decade running counterterrorism operations overseas for the CIA. He worked in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Jordan; met with kings and presidents; rose through the ranks. But he came to believe he was part of the problem, that the very premise of the work was flawed. So he came home, and joined the police force in Savannah, Georgia, where he grew up.\n\nI first learned about Skinner in a New Yorker profile . Then a friend mentioned his Twitter feed to me: There, Skinner reflects, in a thoughtful, continual stream, on the work of policing, the importance of treating your neighbors like neighbors, the daily work of deescalation, and the behavior of his menagerie of pets.\n\nSkinner has been particularly outspoken in the aftermath of George Floyd's death. \"We have to change our profession,\" he wrote. \"We aren't warriors. We aren't at war with our neighbors.\"\n\nI spoke with Skinner by phone on Sunday. He emphasized that his views are his own, and he wasn't speaking on behalf of his department or all police. But what he has to say is, I think, important. A transcript of our conversation, edited for length and clarity, follows.\n\nWhat did you see when you watched the video of George Floyd's death?\n\nA murder. No semantics. No justification. They just killed that guy. I drove home and in a six-minute commute, I was in tears. And it was that I saw the other cops in the video. One of them even looked like me. They were stopping the bystanders, telling them to get back. It's not just that this cop did this. The other cops stopped anyone from stopping him.\n\nWhat should they have done?\n\nThey should have arrested the cop! Ideally, you'd just push the cop off. Tell him to knock it off. That would've ended it. When people have handcuffs on, they are legally in your custody. You have to care for them. What happens to them is your fault. If someone is kicking the windows out of the car, which I've had done, you need to take them out of the car. You need to do something. But this wasn't that. And even if there had been, there was no justification. He just sat on his back. Floyd said he was dying, and he died.\n\nIf a police officer sees another police officer doing that, they are bound to stop him. I could see that cop, who was younger than me, he keeps looking back at what's happening. The people in the community are yelling. They're saying, \"You're killing him.\" You can see this cop - I want to be charitable, he was torn, but he wasn't torn enough to act. The crime had switched from counterfeit [Floyd was suspected of trying to pass a fake $20 bill] to an assault. And the assaulter was the cop. There is nothing to say to justify it. Nothing.\n\nOver the past couple of nights, as you've seen the collisions between police and protesters, what has that looked like to you?\n\nIt looks like what we designed. I'm a big believer that the police shouldn't act like the military. We shouldn't dress like the military. We shouldn't have military weapons. When you can't tell the difference between the police and the National Guard, that's a big problem. But police have been militarized. This is the result of that. And I'm sympathetic to the police. When a protest tips into a riot, when you have thousands of people who're screaming, and it's a visceral, pulsing thing, it's terrifying. But the whole point is you can defuse it. And the time for deescalation is years ahead of that. And a lot of places aren't doing that.\n\nSo the police are now in a terrible position. Ninety-nine percent of the people are protesting. And it's a protest, not a parade. For anything to change, there has to be annoyance and conflict. I get that. But the people who are throwing rocks and bricks and setting fires, that's a big deal. And then the focus will quickly be on how to handle people setting fires. It's sad. It's already happening. We're already talking about the response to the riots, not the cause of the protests.\n\nYou did counterinsurgency work overseas for a decade, as part of the CIA. How much of that thinking do you see here? How much are American communities treated like an internal insurgency that needs to be restrained?\n\nI see it 100 percent. It's the same thing. I got more hazard pay over there, I guess. We spent so much money to do so much damage. We kept saying we needed the community on our side, but everything we did made sure we wouldn't get the community on our side. We put all our efforts and money into whoever supported us. We go for the leader or alleged leader who agrees with us most. We're trying to say we're in a war zone, but they should like us. The answer overseas was to leave. If you don't want to be seen as an occupying army, don't occupy the country. But we live here. We can't leave.\n\nYou write often about policing with \"neighbor\" mindset and training others to do the same. What is neighbor mindset?\n\nIt's the exact opposite. I don't think of it as a mindset; I just think of it as a truth. The neighbor mindset sounds so cheesy, but it's so powerful: We all matter or none of us do. I live here. I can't know everybody in Savannah. But I call everyone my neighbor, because they literally are. And I can't put my knee on the neck of my neighbor. He might resist arrest. I get that. But you don't sit for eight minutes with your knee on the neck of your neighbor.\n\nI do a lot of recruit training and I say: This is not semantics. If they're your neighbors, you can't treat them this way. There's going to be a task force and recommendations, and they'll sound really good. But a friend told me once: Grand gestures are for assholes. You need to do the right thing every day. You need the kind of connection built off a thousand days of not being an asshole. That's what buys you time.\n\nBut this is not a training issue. People want it so badly to be an issue of training. Training is part of it. We train for our goals. Our goal is a war on crime. And we're getting a war. I saw the war on terror; it was horrible. Now I see the war on crime, and it's just as bad.\n\nA lot of the war-on-crime mindset and all of the worst instances of police violence are justified by fear: fear that police have that they'll be shot on a stop, that they need to act like soldiers because they are in a war even if the rest of us aren't. How do you think about that?\n\nLast year, my sergeant was murdered on the job. There is no lesson to be learned from that. What happened was a bad guy jumped out of the car and shot him in the stomach. But the lesson isn't to approach everyone with a gun out.\n\nI'm a training officer now. I always ask: If you didn't have a badge and a gun, how would you handle that situation? Because I guarantee you, if you walk into that situation with your gun and badge out, you'll use them. People kill cops, they do. But we are teaching ourselves to be afraid. In my experience, the closer I get to people, the safer I am. I reject the idea that everyone wants to kill us. And if I get killed, I'll be able to say, at least I didn't handle 99.9 percent of calls wrong.\n\nI've seen you talk about \"intentionality\" as a key to good policing. What intentions do you bring to a stop?\n\nOur job is not to bring more drama into the situation. We speed to an uncertainty and jump out and act with certainty; it's crazy. If someone is shooting at me, that's easy, I take cover. But when we get into these environments where people are screaming, we just need to slow down. The information in 911 calls is almost always wrong. And I hate when people say there's no time to think. We're the ones rushing into it. We're amped up on adrenaline. We show up and immediately [start] telling people to do stuff. I find it very beneficial to just ask, \"What's going on?\"\n\nYou wrote on Twitter that \"The time for de-escalation is long before the riot ... My job is to work with my neighbors every single day to reduce the fuel/dry tinder that catches fire from a spark.\" How do you do that?\n\nI remember I saw a bunch of people in a car. It was three other people. They saw me and really quickly put on their seatbelts. So I started laughing and made a big show of putting on my seatbelt. And we all giggled and no one got a ticket. You can't treat people like an ATM machine, and that's what other departments have done. They fine them for everything. But we have no idea, a lot of the time, what's going on. And unless you're shooting at me, I can take some time to figure it out.\n\nYou said earlier you're not optimistic a task force will change any of this. So how does it change? What needs to happen?\n\nPeople need to imagine the end of a war. That's what they need to accept. Our training is spot on: We're in a war on crime, and it's us versus them, and our neighbors are sheep we need to protect. You hear the term civilians. I thought we were all civilians! Our training fits the mindset.\n\nThe question we need to ask is: What's the point? What do we want to see happen? It's about what we expect the police to do. If I was commissioner of all police on the planet, I'd say there's a ceasefire in the war on crime. We're going to work for the 99 percent of people instead of against the 1 percent. Most 911 calls I go to are not crimes. They may become crimes, but our job is to stop it. We're taught that it's a war. It's not. But it's becoming a war.\n\nWe are the action arm for a fucked-up national mindset. This doesn't exist in isolation. America has the police force that it votes for, that it funds. This system is what we set up. We spent a lot of money and a lot of time over hundreds of years to have this police force. We are trained for what we're hired for, and what we're hired for is war.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

      "text": "Verdict reached in trial of cop who placed woman in patrol car hit by train\n\nThe woman suffered severe injuries after the train plowed into the vehicle.\n\nA Colorado police officer on trial for placing a handcuffed woman in a patrol car parked on train tracks that was then struck by a freight train was found guilty of two misdemeanors.\n\nFort Lupton police officer Jordan Steinke was charged with attempted reckless manslaughter, a felony, and two misdemeanors -- reckless endangerment and third-degree assault -- in connection with the September 2022 incident, which left the woman severely injured.\n\nJudge Timothy Kerns found Steinke not guilty of attempted reckless manslaughter, saying the court did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the officer \"knowingly intended to harm\" Yareni Rios-Gonzalez, the victim. But Kerns said Steinke did disregard \"what she consciously observed,\" citing the presence of railroad tracks and signs on the highway, in explaining his guilty verdict in the misdemeanors.\n\nKerns read his verdict in the Weld County courtroom on Friday. Steinke had waived her right to a jury trial, so Kerns decided the case.\n\nSteinke wept in court as the judge explained his verdict. Her sentencing hearing has been scheduled for Sept. 15. Her attorney requested an immediate sentencing on her behalf, though prosecutors said Rios-Gonzalez, who observed the verdict remotely, wanted to attend the sentencing in person.\n\nSteinke and a Platteville police officer were investigating a road rage incident when they pulled over Rios-Gonzalez on Sept. 16, 2022. Steinke placed Rios-Gonzalez handcuffed in the back of the Platteville police cruiser, which was parked on train tracks. A short time later, a freight train plowed into the vehicle. The horrifying collision was captured by police body and dash cameras, with the footage later released by the Platteville, Colorado, Police Department.\n\nRios-Gonzalez, 21, suffered a fractured tibia, broken arm, nine broken ribs and a fractured sternum in the incident, her attorney told \"Good Morning America \" last year.\n\nDuring the trial, prosecutors argued that Steinke knew the police cruiser was parked on train tracks but disregarded the obvious risk.\n\n\"At the time she elected to place Yareni Rios-Gonzalez in the Platteville patrol car parked on the railroad tracks instead of her own patrol unit that was safely parked to the west of the railroad tracks,\" Weld County Deputy District Attorney Lacy Vells said in court this week.\n\nThe defense, meanwhile, contended there was no intent to harm and the incident was a \"horrific\" accident.\n\n\"Officer Steinke was not trying to harm Miss Rios-Gonzalez,\" defense attorney Mallory Revel said in closing arguments on Thursday. \"To the contrary, this accident has haunted officer Steinke every single day since it occurred. It was a horrific accident.\"\n\nSteinke took the stand on Tuesday, telling the court that she saw the railroad tracks but did not \"perceive\" the fact that the location was a railroad crossing. She said she did not see any reflective signs or gates indicating a railroad crossing at the time of the incident.\n\n\"It was incredibly dark. I was miles outside of my jurisdiction,\" Steinke told the court. \"I was fairly certain that that particular stop was going to end in a gun fight. I never in a million years thought a train was going to come plowing through my scene.\"\n\nShe claimed she would not have put Rios-Gonzalez in the vehicle if she knew it was parked on train tracks and that she had \"trusted\" that the Platteville police officer's vehicle \"was in a secure location at that time.\"\n\nThe Platteville officer, Pablo Vazquez, has also been charged with reckless endangerment, among other counts, in the incident. His case is ongoing.\n\nRios-Gonzalez is also suing police over her treatment. One of the attorneys representing her in the civil case, Chris Ponce, pushed back against the defense's argument ahead of the verdict and said the situation was not stressful.\n\n\"Their defense is that this situation was so stressful to this officer that she simply did not notice that the train tracks were there,\" Ponce told Denver ABC affiliate KMGH . \"It's our opinion -- again, as we've stated in documents that we've filed publicly -- that is just not true. It's simply not true. The train tracks were obvious.\"\n\nPonce told the station his client would respect and accept whatever verdict is reached in the criminal proceedings.\n\nRios-Gonzalez also faced charges stemming from the road rage incident prior to police pulling her over. She entered a no-contest plea earlier this month to misdemeanor menacing, according to The Association Press . She will avoid jail time if she follows the conditions of her deferred sentence, KMGH reported .\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

While Brazil's overall score is 5.57, the country has a 6.56 in CO2 reduction, putting it ahead of other BRICS.

Deforestation lawsuits delayed JBS SA's 2023 plans to list in New York. Current analysis shows it has 9% of its assets in pristine areas. It is making progress in reducing emissions but is falling short of some net-zero commitments. In October, JBS was among those fined $64 million by Brazil's environmental protection agency, IBAMA.\n\n\"With more than half of the Amazon rainforest and the planet's greatest concentration of biodiversity within its borders, Brazil has an outsized role to play in global carbon and environmental markets,\" Vinicius Nunes, BloombergNEF climate solutions associate, wrote .\n\nRun GOVS to review Brazil's climate score and check ESG metrics.

      "text": "What is COP28? The UN climate summit, explained\n\nFollow:\n\nTens of thousands of people are heading to Dubai in early December for COP28 , the annual international climate summit convened by the United Nations.\n\nWith time quickly running out to prevent fossil fuel pollution from causing irreversible harm, discussions between global leaders, negotiators, climate advocates and industry representatives have shifted to how the world should adapt to more deadly heatwaves , stronger storms and catastrophic sea level rise .\n\nDespite the widespread impacts of the climate crisis, the annual negotiations have been contentious. The road to consensus on solutions has proven rocky, and has highlighted divisions between rich countries - which emit a majority of the world's planet-warming pollution - and poor nations, which have contributed the least .\n\nHere's what to know about the world's most critical climate change conference.\n\nA little over 30 years ago, more than 150 countries signed a UN treaty to limit the alarming rise of planet-warming pollution in the atmosphere. While the science behind human-caused climate change was still young, scientists knew even then it would be life-changing.\n\nThe first COP - the \"Conference of the Parties\" to that agreement - took place in Berlin in 1995. Member states have been convening on climate change almost every year since. In 2015, at COP21, more than 190 countries approved the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, but preferably to 1.5 degrees.\n\nAlthough the Paris Agreement was a landmark moment and set the world on a path that scientists supported, it didn't get specific about how countries should achieve its goal. Since then, COPs have sought to make the plans attached to the Paris Agreement more ambitious and to be more specific about the changes society would need to make.\n\nThe climate summit is hosted at a different location each year. While there have been other host countries mired in controversy, the backlash to this year's host - the United Arab Emirates - has been particularly sharp; not only is the UAE a major oil-producing nation, it has also appointed a top fossil-fuel executive as its COP president.\n\nCritics say it's a conflict of interest to have Sultan Al Jaber, the head of the UAE's national oil company, taking charge of the most important climate conference of the year. In facing that criticism, the UAE has embarked on a major campaign to boost its green credentials ahead of the summit, CNN has previously reported .\n\nIn May, more than 100 members of the US Congress and the European Parliament called for Al Jaber to step down, claiming that his role could undermine negotiations.\n\nSome key players - including US climate envoy John Kerry - have praised Al Jaber's appointment. The UAE has rejected criticism that the country is unfit to host the world's largest climate summit, with the COP28 team previously telling CNN that the UAE was the first in the Middle East to set 2030 and 2050 emissions reduction targets.\n\nHeads of states and governments deliver speeches in the first days of the summit. More than 160 member nations, including the UK, France, Germany and Japan, have confirmed their attendance.\n\nPerhaps the highest-profile attendees will be King Charles III, who will deliver an address at the summit's opening ceremony.\n\nPope Francis was planning to be the first pontiff to attend COP, but the trip was cancelled Tuesday following his doctor's advice.\n\nThe Pope's state of \"influenza and inflammation of the respiratory tract has improved,\" but the \"doctors have asked the Pope not to make the trip planned for the next few days,\" Vatican spokesperson Matteo Bruni said in a statement. \"Pope Francis accepted the doctors' request with great regret and the trip was therefore cancelled.\"\n\nAbsent from the speakers list are US President Joe Biden and China's Xi Jinping - the leaders of the world's top polluting countries. In mid-November, Biden and Xi pledged to significantly r amp up renewable energy in lieu of planet-cooking fossil fuels, and agreed to resume a working group on climate cooperation.\n\nIn lieu of Biden, US Vice President Kamala Harris will attend the summit - a trip that was announced following pushback that Biden was missing global meeting on an issue important to young voters.\n\nLeaders from major oil-producing countries, such as Saudi Arabia, Syria, Russia and Iran, are among those attending.\n\nThere are concerns that the Israel-Hamas war could overshadow action on climate this year, particularly in the Middle East. But representatives from both Israel and the Palestinian territories are listed to speak in the first week.\n\nThe UAE has also invited many fossil fuel executives to the climate talks, where they are expected to announce new commitments to decarbonize. A list of Wall Street financial heavyweights led by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink will also be present, after missing the summit in Egypt last year.\n\nIt's been eight years since the Paris Agreement, yet the world has made barely any progress on slashing climate pollution, and the window is \"rapidly narrowing\" to do so, according to the agreement's first scorecard - the global stocktake - which was published in September.\n\nScientists sound the alarm as the world briefly smashes through 2-degree warming limit for the first time\n\nCOP28 will be the first time that countries will be going into the negotiation rooms with an analysis that shows how seriously off-track they are on their climate targets.\n\n\"It tells us clearly that the world is not on track to achieve our global climate goals,\" Melanie Robinson, the global climate program director for the World Resources Institute, told CNN.\n\n\"But it also offers a really interesting concrete blueprint [and] mountain of evidence on how we can get the job done, so it should be a wakeup call of what we need to do but with a roadmap to get there.\"\n\nSome of the biggest concerns that will take center stage in Dubai are continuations from COP27 in Egypt: finalizing a \"loss and damage\" fund and discussing how to ramp down planet-warming fossil fuels.\n\nA major debate among the parties has been whether to \"phase out\" or \"phase down\" fossil fuels. At COP27, a number of nations, including China and Saudi Arabia, blocked a key proposal to phase out all fossil fuels - including oil and gas - and not just coal.\n\n\"The most important thing is the outcome at this COP sends a really strong signal that the world must rapidly shift away from fossil fuels,\" Robinson said. \"I would note that it's important for the language to refer to all fossil fuels.\"\n\nAnother focus this year will be on the so-called loss and damage fund , which countries included in last year's agreement. The fund would help shuttle money from the richest countries, which are responsible for the vast majority of the climate crisis, to poor countries, where the impacts have hit hardest.\n\nThe goal is to get the fund up and running by 2024. With time running out , a special committee met in Abu Dhabi in early November and recommended the World Bank host the fund and serve as its trustee temporarily for four years.\n\nThe loss and damage fund is a delicate and nuanced issue, said Nate Warszawski, a research associate with WRI's International Climate Action team. \"I do think this could be one of the key issues that makes or breaks the COP,\" he told CNN.\n\nCNN's Ivana Kottasová contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "The UN climate summit ended in bitterness and accusations of betrayal. Now fears are growing for its future\n\nFollow:\n\nThis year's UN climate summit in Baku, Azerbaijan kicked off with a fulsome celebration of fossil fuels, praised by the country's president Ilham Aliyev as a \"gift of God.\" It ended with a climate finance deal developing countries called an insult, a joke and a betrayal .\n\nThe question at COP29 was how much wealthy countries, most responsible for the climate crisis, owe poor countries facing the worst impacts. The answer: $300 billion a year by 2035. Rich countries said it was the best they could do. Poorer countries called it \"abysmal,\" falling far below the $1.3 trillion economists say they need to cope with a crisis they have not caused.\n\nIn the wake of a chaotic, bitter summit and heavily criticized final deal, some experts are asking whether the whole COP process is now so lacking in ambition as to be almost worthless.\n\nAmid geopolitical upheaval, including the election of a climate denier in the US, Baku might be remembered as the beginning of the end of multilateral climate action.\n\n\"The dismal outcomes of COP29 ... have raised serious concerns about the integrity of the global climate negotiation process,\" said Harjeet Singh, of the Fossil Fuel Treaty Initiative.\n\nCOP climate summits are always painstaking and fraught. But they have had major successes, most notably the 2015 Paris climate agreement, under which countries committed to keeping global warming to well under 2 degrees Celsius, and preferably to 1.5.\n\nAnd yet, nearly a decade later, the world is on track for the hottest year on record and levels of planet-heating pollution are projected to reach an all-time high .\n\n\"We are sleepwalking into a dystopian future,\" said Payam Akhavan, an attorney for the Commission of Small Island States on Climate Change and International Law.\n\n\"The COP process has thus far failed, because it depends on the good faith of the major polluters, and instead of doing what is necessary for our common survival, they are literally adding fuel to the flames,\" he told CNN.\n\nIn many ways, COP29 was set up to fail from the start: Russia ensured the summit was held in a fossil fuel-reliant nation by using its United Nations veto to prevent any European Union country from hosting.\n\nSo it fell to Azerbaijan, a petrostate with little experience leading high level climate talks, to wrangle negotiations on money, the thorniest of climate issues.\n\nIt was a conference of chaos . Many wealthy country leaders failed to show up, Argentina pulled out its negotiators, and some developing country groups grew so frustrated in the final throes of talks, they walked out.\n\nCOPs have been held in petrostates before. But fossil fuel interests appeared truly unleashed in Baku - potentially emboldened by the imminent arrival of Donald Trump in the White House, a man who has vowed to \"drill, baby, drill\" and pull the US out of the Paris climate agreement.\n\nMore than 1,700 fossil fuel industry players and lobbyists registered to attend the summit,  heavily outnumbering most country delegations.\n\nAnd Saudi Arabia, a constant thorn in the side of those pushing ambitious climate action, said the quiet bit out loud at this summit, publicly and explicitly rejecting any mention of fossil fuels in the final agreement.\n\nClimate groups compared the final deal to a band-aid on a bullet wound, and developing countries reacted with fury.\n\n\"This is not just a failure; it is a betrayal,\" the Least Developed Countries Group on Climate Change said in a statement, adding that the \"outright dismissal\" of developing countries' needs \"erodes the fragile trust that underpins these negotiations and mocks the spirit of global solidarity.\"\n\nFor all its flaws, most climate advocates and scientists acknowledge the UN climate process remains the best mechanism the world currently has for global climate action.\n\n\"It's the only forum where nearly every country has a seat at the table,\" said Margaretha Wewerinke-Singh, an international lawyer representing the small island country of Vanuatu in climate litigation. \"The real question,\" she told CNN, \"is whether the momentum can be reclaimed, and the integrity of the process restored.\"\n\nAttention now turns to COP30 in Brazil next year. Billed as the most important climate summit since Paris, it's here countries will set out their climate plans for the next 10 years. Ambition will be a uphill battle.\n\nRelated article Climate leaders were worried Trump would derail talks. They didn't know their host would be the wrecking ball\n\nTo succeed, the whole system needs reorienting, Singh said, \"to serve the interests of the most vulnerable, rather than those of fossil fuel lobbyists and polluters.\"\n\nThis is likely to be tough as the geopolitical terrain changes, and right-wing politicians who embrace fossil fuels and deride climate action see electoral success.\n\nThere is still some hope, Akhavan said. \"Even if in the short-term there might be a regression because of populists and petro-states, there is ultimately no choice but to return to a 'bigger and better' COP 2.0.\"\n\nIt's a sentiment echoed by Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College London. \"By lamenting on the broken process, we just add to the stalling and delay,\" she told CNN. \"We need to save the institutions we have. If we throw them in the gutter, Trump, Putin and Co. have won already.\"\n\nCNN's Ella Nilsen contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

      "text": "Why this former cop left the force: 'Policing is not about helping'\n\nTerrell Carter never wanted to be a police officer. But then he learned he'd be a father and his life turned inside-out.\n\nDecades ago, when he was 23, his wife told him she was pregnant. \"I needed a steady, well-paying job with benefits,\" Carter said in an interview with Insider.\n\nAt the time, he worked in construction, doing maintenance work on a downtown St. Louis, Missouri, building. After his wife delivered the news, he walked into another room and prayed he'd find a different job to support his growing family.\n\nThe next day, he heard a radio ad while driving that invited listeners to join the police force. He called up his best friend's father, an officer of several years, for advice.\n\n\"I'm about to be a dad, and I know that your life circumstances were similar to mine when you were my age: young husband, young father,\" Carter recalled telling the man. \"What do you think about me applying to the police department as well?\"\n\nThe two spoke on the phone for about half an hour. The conversation reassured him, helping Carter learn that his family would get a \"really nice lump sum of money\" if something were to happen to him on the job, an idea that comforted him. \"At least my family would be taken care of,\" he said.\n\nCarter applied and got into the police academy, where he spent eight hours a day in a classroom.\n\nThe hardest part was \"wrapping my mind around what it meant to carry a badge and a gun,\" he told Insider. The thought of dying constantly loomed over him at each training, during which officers spoke freely about the dangers of the job.\n\nThe only thing keeping him going, he said, was the prospect of security, money, and support for his family.\n\nHis partner on the force had planted drugs on three civilians in 2002, and Carter testified against him in court.\n\nNearly two decades later, the incident plays out in his memory like a movie.\n\nAfter receiving a tip of a drug sale at a nearby daycare, Carter and his partner, accompanied by a detective, detained a woman who confessed to possession a \"golf ball-size rock of crack.\"\n\nShe claimed to have been holding it for her boyfriend, who paged her to say he'd show up at the daycare shortly to retrieve it.\n\nIntercepting the meetup, Carter and his partner found and subdued three men in a truck. One of the men had a gun, and Carter tussled with him to avoid getting shot.\n\nCarter insists they searched for drugs in the truck \"multiple times\" but couldn't find any. That's when his partner, coming around an area that they had already searched, pulled out the crack they had retrieved off the young woman, making it seem like he found it in the truck.\n\n\"This guy was a drug dealer that my partner had been searching for for years and could never catch, and this was his opportunity to get this guy and finally arrest him,\" Carter said. Back at the station, his partner wrote up a report of the day's incident.\n\nWeeks later, Carter received a notice from federal prosecutors asking him to attend a probation revocation hearing to discuss an arrest.\n\nOne of the three men arrested that day had a hearing to determine whether to revoke him of probation and place him in jail for the crack Carter's partner said he found in the truck. Carter learned about the contents of the report for the first time at this hearing.\n\n\"He wrote that there was a baseball size of crack, not a golfball size of crack,\" Carter said. \"He wrote in the report that when we found him at the daycare, they were cutting crack and weighing it on scales outside the truck. That the guy who I found had a gun - I didn't find the gun on him in the vehicle, I found it on him later. But he said that guy was in the backseat twirling the gun on his fingers like a cowboy.\"\n\nThe first claim was inaccurate, and the second and third simply did not happen. But his partner still testified under oath, repeating the exaggerated and fabricated claims he wrote in the initial report.\n\nCarter, however, went against him, telling the room that \"what was in the report is not what I remember about the incident.\"\n\n\"I'm not saying that they were good people, not saying that they hadn't done bad things in the past or whatever,\" Carter said. \"But you don't have to lie in order to send someone to prison.\"\n\nThe FBI stepped in and interviewed the three men arrested. Their stories matched up with Carter's, and his partner went to prison.\n\nThe ordeal compelled Carter to restart his life - this time as a community organizer and spiritual leader who seeks to educate people about the role of policing.\n\nOver recent years, investigations have revealed that police officers nationwide abide by quotas that require them to hit specific numbers of arrests , which exacerbates the chance that they'll stop people of color because of unchecked racial bias.\n\nThat's what Carter says policing is all about: doing a job in a particularly punitive way to maintain status as an officer.\n\nIn the NYPD, the largest police department in the US, one former officer testified under oath that superiors would take away overtime or promotion possibilities from officers who did not meet the quotas.  \" Collars for dollars \" - making arrests at the end of the shift in the hopes of getting overtime pay - is a common practice among police.\n\nOfficers wait until the end of the day to fulfill their quotas and make their arrests, leading to extra hours after work spent putting together reports - a tactic used to gain significant overtime hours and pay.\n\nIn 2014, four officers collectively made $1,400 in overtime pay for an extra 20 hours of overtime. And June 2020, the NYPD made over $115 million in overtime in overtime pay within just two weeks at the height of the protests against police brutality following the murder of George Floyd.\n\nCarter says these kinds of incentives are protected and encouraged by the current system of policing.\n\n\"You don't get rewarded as a police officer for doing good,\" he said. \"You get rewarded for doing what the system requires of you.\"\n\nIt's also about making arrests to advance the department itself, he added.\n\nIn the best-selling book, \"The New Jim Crow,\" civil rights lawyer Michelle Alexander said police departments nationwide have for years been financially incentivized to conduct mass minor drug arrests, leading to the often-years-long imprisonment of millions of Black Americans .\n\n\"Huge cash grants were made to those law enforcement agencies that were willing to make drug-law enforcement a top priority,\" Alexander wrote. There are other benefits given to police departments that center this, such as free training and support from agencies like the Drug Enforcement Administration.\n\nSuch incentives are part of the backwards and unethical logic behind the system of policing as we know it, Carter suggested.\n\nWhile Carter believes a policing system is necessary because there will always be violence and a need to protect the public, he argued police need better training - particularly when it comes to racial biases, critical race theory, and mental health.\n\nAnd it's not just white officers who should study these things. Carter's partner was a Black man who, \"on top of everything else, was doing this to other Black people.\"\n\nOfficers of color are often perpetuating a broken system against other people of color. People who don't believe the system of policing is racist commonly cite this as an argument to support their claim.\n\nBut Alexander's explained that minority officers are complicit in mass incarceration and often feel like they can't go against the status quo. Even departments that are led by officers who are Black or brown have issues like the ones outlined by Carter.\n\n\"People of color are often reluctant to challenge institutions led by people who look like them, as they feel a personal stake in the individual's success,\" Alexander wrote. \"After centuries of being denied access to leadership positions in key social institutions, people of color quite understandably are hesitant to create circumstances that could trigger the downfall of 'one of their own.'\"\n\nAt the same time, police don't have to respond to everything, Carter said.\n\nHe doesn't think police should respond to calls unrelated to criminal actions or violations. Mental health professionals, for example, should be dispatched to resolve and de-escalate mental health challenges. Animal control should respond to animal-related calls.\n\n\"Send out the people who are best trained, best qualified to handle the diversity of things that occur on any given night in a given community,\" he said.\n\nThese days, Carter wears many hats and works to transform the St. Louis community and to better the relationship between police and people of color,  serving as the vice chair of the St. Louis Mental Health Board.\n\nHe's also the executive director of Rise Community Development, a nonprofit focused on advocating for and developing sustainable and affordable housing in the St. Louis area. He's also written numerous books on policing, including \" Police on a Pedestal \" and \" Walking the Blue Line: A Police Officer Turned Community Activist .\"\n\nThough no longer involved with the police as an officer, he still has ties to the St. Louis law enforcement community.\n\nCarter's view is not popular among the police in St. Louis. But multiple officers who've quit or retired from the force have previously told him they wish they had stood up for the right thing like he did.\n\nJump to"

The buddy cop duo escort high-schooler Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) for a night on the town after the awkward teen convinces them he's a 40-year-old named McLovin.\n\nAs it turns out, Hader had some experience with law enforcement prior to filming \"Superbad.\"\n\n\"I remember when I did that movie... and I go, 'I got messed with by a cop with glasses,' and Seth was like, 'Oh yeah, that's, like, so lame. I can't take a cop with glasses seriously!'\"\n\nHader explained that he got in trouble with the law because he was inspired by the pranks his father pulled in his youth.\n\n\"My dad did the classic 'let me tell you something I did, but hey, you guys can't do this,' and we were like, 'Uh-huh,'\" he said. \"He was like, 'We used to take two trash cans and put fishing wire between 'em and we'd put one on either side of the street and when a car goes through, the trash cans go bop on the side of the car. It was hilarious, but don't do that.' And we were like, 'Okay!'\"\n\nAccording to Hader, he and his friends used two trash cans and a giant piece of rope to recreate the prank along a four-lane street. However, the victim of their joke ended up being a police officer.\n\n\"It's really late at night. We're at a park, we're waiting, and here comes a car. I'm like, 'Alright, ready, go!'

The head of NYPD's Strategic Technology Division called the Apple phones a \"force multiplier,\" partially because it can sent alerts to all cops with iPhones in a geographic area.\n\nNew York police already receive a work phone - the big change is that it will now be a relatively new iPhone, instead of an aging Nokia Windows Phone.\n\nThe city announced a $160 million \"mobility initiative\" in 2014 to give every cop a phone, and finally finished the Windows Phone rollout in October 2016.\n\nBut shortly afterwards, the city decided that iPhones may be a better tool for police than the Nokia phones it had been previously using.\n\nAn NYPD spokesperson said last year that the iPhones would be provided to the department at no cost, and the Daily News reported on Monday that the new phones are considered a hardware upgrade under the police's contract with AT&T.\n\nThere is one good reason why NYPD would have to switch from Windows Phone. The Nokia phones police were using were released in 2014 and 2015, and last year, Microsoft officially discontinued support for Windows Phone 8.1 software, which the devices used. Without official Microsoft support, the NYPD could've been using insecure devices.\n\nStill, the Nokia phones were effective, leading to an 8% reduction in response times, a spokesperson said last year.

According to the \"Know Your Meme\" database, the term traveled from 4chan forums to Reddit and across other social media platforms - where \"Chad\" became synonymous with, as one Redditor described it, \"the default name for alpha douchebros.\"\n\n\"[H]oly sh-t he's real,\" @warmgourloko c aptioned the tweet, which received 290,000 likes in just two days.\n\nThe following day, the image appeared on the r/funny subreddit, which boasts 31.8 million members, captioned \"Chad is real.\" It was then re-posted to several popular subreddits, including r/Justfuckmyshitup , r/PewdiepieSubmissions , and r/blursedimages - a community that describes itself as a space for posting images that are \"BOTH blessed and cursed.\"\n\nAcross subreddits, commenters delighted in the police officer's exaggerated look. Some dubbed him \"Johnny Bravo IRL,\" as the hairstyle bears a striking resemblance to that of the main character from Cartoon Network's hit show that ran until 2004.\n\nOthers referred to the pictured officer as \"Chad Cop.\"\n\nThe photo was also widely shared on Twitter, where users also likened the featured officer Johnny Bravo and the \"Chad\" meme - and some posted the photo along with messages about \"defund[ing] the police.\"\n\nThe iconic hairstyle, however, does not appear in the original 2016 photo of the Chicago Police Officer.\n\nJournalist Ryan Broderick shared a side-by-side comparison of the viral photo and the original image, snapped by news photographer Scott Olson, on Twitter .\n\n\"So I actually totally fell for it when I first saw it, the photo going around Reddit of the Chad Cop is photoshopped,\" Broderick wrote.\n\nThe truth behind the image was met with some disappointment and amusement.\n\n\"[T]he fact that I thought this was real shows how far 2020 has degraded my mental health and sanity,\" one Twitter user quipped .\n\nSeveral others described themselves as \"saddened\" to learn of the photoshopping, with some joking that their days had been \" ruined \" by the news.\n\nThe original photo , according to Getty Images, was taken at an April 2016 protest in Chicago following the death of Pierre Loury.\n\nLoury, a 16-year-old from the North Lawndale neighborhood, was shot by police after being pulled over for traveling in a vehicle matching the description of a car used in a drive-by shooting. Police say Loury fled the scene and an \"armed confrontation\" ensued.\n\nThe most iconic protest photos of all time\n\nCalls to 'arrest the cops who killed Breonna Taylor' have been turned into an online meme that some say has gone too far\n\nHow the name 'Karen' became a stand-in for problematic white women and a hugely popular meme\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Why the 'Beverly Hills Cop\" director chose to film an actual car falling off a building over using CGI: 'The stakes are real, and the danger is real.'\n\nIn an era when everything from car chases to even kisses in movies can be done with computer-generated visual effects, director Mark Molloy wanted to go against the grain with \" Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F \" by doing all the action sequences with practical effects.\n\nMolloy was set on his stance from the beginning, when he took his first meetings with franchise producer Jerry Bruckheimer and got the offer to direct the sequel, which was decades in the making.\n\n\"I went to Jerry and said, 'I love this but I want to make an '80s action comedy, I want to shoot everything in-camera,'\" Molloy recalled to Business Insider during a recent chat over Zoom.\n\nThough \"Axel F\" marks Molloy's feature directing debut after decades of commercial work and directing TV in his native Australia, the filmmaker knew instantly that the only way a fourth \"Beverly Hills Cop\" movie would work would be if it stayed true to the texture and attitude of the beloved first two movies, which were box office hits and made Eddie Murphy a superstar in the late 1980s (let's just forget there was a third movie ).\n\n\"A lot of films these days, everything is so VFX-heavy that there's a perfection there,\" he said. \"I wanted to ground it. The stakes are real, and the danger is real. Like films 1 and 2, those were gritty films.\"\n\nBruckheimer loved the idea, which led to Molloy filming Murphy driving a massive snow plow through rows of parked cars in Detroit and a scene in which they actually had a car fall off the side of a building in Los Angeles.\n\n\"We had to shut down part of the I-10 to do that,\" Molloy said with glee, referring to one of the busiest freeways in Los Angeles.\n\nIn that scene, Axel Foley's daughter Jane, played by Taylour Paige (\"Zola\"), gets a visit from the movie's bad guys, who end up yanking the car off the side of the parking garage. (Though doing this stunt for real was fun, Molloy pointed out Paige was not in the car when that stunt was filmed. Safety first.)\n\n\"It was a perfect location that we found, but it's literally right next to the I-10, so we had to close part of that down, or people were going to get into crashes if they suddenly saw a car fall off the side of a building,\" Molloy said.\n\nBut the action sequence that kept him up at night was the helicopter scene. Toward the end of the movie, Foley and Detective Abbott (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) steal a police helicopter to escape Grant (Kevin Bacon), the crooked police captain. Aside from the interior shots of Murphy and Gordon-Levitt in the cockpit, the entire sequence used a real helicopter that did everything from freefalling between buildings to flying so low that there were sparks as it scraped the road. The sequence concludes with the chopper landing not so gracefully in front of the Beverly Hills Town Hall.\n\nLooking back on it now, Molloy laughs in disbelief at how he tackled such ambitious scenes. \"It was very challenging.\"\n\n\"Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F\" is now available on Netflix.\n\nJump to"

Barnes died at the scene.\n\nAt issue is whether lower courts, in analyzing whether Felix used excessive force, inappropriately focused on the exact moment he decided to shoot and not the moments leading up to it.\n\nThe ruling will help determine whether a civil rights lawsuit filed by Barnes' mother, Janice Hughes, can move forward. She claims Felix used excessive force in violation of the Constitution's Fourth Amendment. She also filed a separate claim against the police department, which is not directly at issue before the Supreme Court.\n\nJustices from across the ideological spectrum appeared to agree that the approach taken by lower courts was wrong based on Supreme Court precedent that says the \"totality of the circumstances\" has to be taken into account.\n\nThat means more than just the two seconds prior to Felix's decision to use force should be considered, the justices indicated.\n\nBut the ruling is likely to be a narrow one that simply sends the case back to lower courts for further review without determining whether excessive force was used, which would be for those courts to decide.\n\n\"So it seems as though we should kick it back [to lower courts] and let you guys fight it out as to the relevance of anything that happened beyond the prior two seconds,\" said Justice Elena Kagan.\n\nSome justices also appeared concerned about issuing a ruling that would make it more difficult for police officers to do their jobs if they potentially could be sued for their role in escalating a situation.\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh in particular seemed worried about any ruling from the court that would indicate it would be unreasonable for an officer to jump onto a car when the driver is seeking to drive away.\n\n\"What's an officer supposed to do when at a traffic stop and someone pulls away. Just them them go?\" he asked. He noted that in some situations, the driver might be about to commit criminal acts, including violent ones.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch also appeared to oppose the court getting into the question of whether the officer's actions led to the use of force, but seemingly for an opposite reason - that he did not want the court to issue a decision that is too pro-police.\n\n\"Why would we put a thumb on the scale that way and say that it's almost impossible to make out a Fourth Amendment claim in those circumstances given the varied nature of encounters between police officers and citizens across the country?\" he asked.\n\nIn an interview with NBC News , Hughes said she was pursuing the case because she wants people to know that \"my son was a victim.\"\n\nAlmost five years after the death of George Floyd, another Black man killed by a police officer, \"nobody's policing the police,\" she added.\n\nAlthough lower courts ruled against Hughes, both a district court judge and a judge on the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said that the precedent adopted by some courts that limits consideration of the moments leading up to the use of force was wrong and should be overturned.\n\nThat mode of analysis, called the \"moment of the threat doctrine,\" would be nullified nationwide if the Supreme Court rules in Hughes' favor. Such a ruling would remove one barrier to plaintiffs bringing claims against police officers.\n\nIf courts ultimately allow Hughes' case to move forward, it would not affect Felix's ability to invoke the qualified immunity defense, which protects cops if it was not \"clearly established\" at the time of the incident that their actions were unlawful.\n\nLawrence Hurley is a senior Supreme Court reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Kyle Kennedy said at an evening news conference.\n\nA pursuit ensued and at one point the suspect lost control of the vehicle he was driving and exchanged gunfire with pursuing troopers, Kennedy said. No injuries were reported, and the chase continued south, he said.\n\nAfter approaching slow traffic, Huizar hit a stopped vehicle and spun into a median, the captain said. Huizar's car then became immobile and, as troopers \"contacted\" the vehicle, the suspect shot himself in the head, Kennedy said.\n\nThe 1-year-old boy Huizar had allegedly kidnapped was safely taken by troopers, Kennedy said. Authorities did not detail how they believed the child was kidnapped.\n\nNo injuries were reported in the second and final crash about 25 miles from the start of the chase, the captain said.\n\n\"Today was a worst-case scenario for us - having a murder suspect in the same vehicle as an innocent juvenile,\" Kennedy said. \"That brings everything up another level for us. It's a zero-sum game for us. We're thankful for the way it turned out.\"\n\nHuizar was charged with first-degree murder in Monday's slaying of Amber Rodriguez, 31, at Wiley Elementary School in West Richland as classes were being let out shortly before 3:30 p.m., Benton County Prosecutor Eric Eisinger said during a Tuesday afternoon news conference.\n\nThe charge of murder includes an aggravated circumstance allegation of domestic violence, as well as a firearm enhancement, Eisinger said.\n\nHuizar was also being investigated in the death of a woman whose body was discovered later Monday when authorities searched his home. That victim has not been identified but was described in an Amber Alert from Washington State Patrol as Huizar's girlfriend.\n\nAccording to a court document filed against Huizar on Monday, witnesses at Wiley Elementary School said a gunman wearing black clothing and a black hat shot Rodriguez. Eight .40-caliber bullet casings were recovered at the scene. Rodriguez was identified after the killing in part through her school employee ID, the documents said.\n\nThe pair's 9-year-old son witnessed the shooting, according to the court filing. The former husband and wife have two children together, according to court documents.\n\nAt the time of the shooting at the school, Huizar was under conditional freedom after being accused of third-degree rape of a child and second-degree rape, Eisinger said. His total bail had been set at $250,000, the prosecutor noted.\n\nAccording to a separate court filing about Huizar's alleged rapes, two teens went to police in early February after a 17-year-old girl - whom prosecutors in the filing said identified herself as Huizar's girlfriend - told officers she woke up to Huizar performing oral sex on her 16-year-old friend, who was \"passed out\" after all three had been drinking alcohol.\n\nHuizar and the 17-year-old \"have a child in common,\" the filing said. Huizar met her when he was a resource officer at her middle school and got her pregnant when she was 15 years old, court records said.\n\nThe teen took the baby and drove off with her 16-year-old friend after February's alleged incident, before flagging down police, the court filing said.\n\nWashington State Patrol on Monday had issued an Amber Alert for the 1-year-old. The state patrol had said Huizar and the boy shared the same last name, but the relationship between them was not immediately clear Tuesday afternoon. It was also not immediately clear whether the child was the same one Huizar had with the 17-year-old.\n\nThe alert was extended from Washington to Oregon as well as other places in the west, Eisinger said. The alert also said the women killed were Huizar's ex-wife and his girlfriend.\n\nKennedy said Oregon State Police received a request to issue the alert about 10:30 p.m. Monday and put it into effect about an hour later.\n\nThe West Richland Police Department said earlier that Huizar was \"armed and considered dangerous, and is likely to commit more crimes.\" Portland police told West Richland authorities that Huizar was seen in the Oregon city overnight, possibly driving a black sedan.\n\nThe Yakima Police Department in Washington said Huizar was an officer there from 2013 to 2022.\n\n\"He did serve as a school resource officer for a period of time, at a couple schools during his employment. Mr. Huizar resigned in February of 2022, immediately following discipline,\" a department spokesperson said.\n\nShelley Redinger, superintendent of the Richland School District, said Huizar passed background checks and answered no to questions that included whether he had ever resigned from an employer with allegations of misconduct pending or if he'd ever been the subject of a workplace investigation accusing him of misconduct.\n\nRedinger said Huizar's last day as a district employee was in June 2023.\n\n\"We are extremely disheartened. That information about his past was not disclosed to us,\" she said. \"It is expectation for individuals who apply for employment with the Richland school district to be forthcoming and truthful in their applications.\"\n\nAntonio Planas is a breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital.\n\nAndrew Blankstein is an investigative reporter for NBC News.

Gowitt .\n\nThe report, dated March 14, was made widely available to the public only this week.\n\nThe proposed Public Safety Training Center, set to include a shooting range and a mock city that will be used for police training, has been dubbed \"Cop City\" by opponents , and it drew protesters to its future site in a forested area of DeKalb County outside Atlanta.\n\nA multiagency operation to clear out an encampment of protesters was conducted the morning of Jan. 18.\n\nAccording to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation , officers found Tortuguita in a tent and said they \"did not comply\" with law enforcement's commands. Tortuguita is alleged to have shot and wounded a state trooper, and then officers opened fire.\n\nRelatives and friends have insisted that Tortuguita had their hands raised and was no threat to police.\n\nTortuguita identified as nonbinary and used they/them pronouns .\n\n\"We are devastated to learn that our child, our sweet Manny, was mercilessly gunned down by police and suffered 57 bullet wounds all over their body,\" Tortuguita's mother, Belkis Teran, said in a statement.\n\nThe family and its representatives said they still have too many unanswered questions.\n\n\"We cannot even begin to determine what happened on the morning of January 18 until the GBI releases its investigation,\" family attorney Brian Spears said in a statement.\n\nAn Atlanta police representative could not immediately be reached for comment Thursday.\n\nA spokesperson for the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said Thursday that state authorities have completed their probe and referred all questions to the prosecutor appointed to the case, Mountain Judicial Circuit DA George Christian.\n\nChristian said Thursday it would be \"premature\" to discuss any findings of investigators and didn't give a timeline for any decision to seek charges against officers who opened fire.\n\nThe report by Gowitt, the medical examiner, took no stance on that issue.\n\n\"Since most shootings involving multiple gunshots are dynamic events attempts to place the decedent in any particular position at a specific point in time is fraught with potential inaccuracies,\" he wrote.\n\n\"There are too many variables with respect to movement of the decedent and the shooters to draw definitive conclusions concerning Mr. Teran's body position.\"\n\nGowitt listed Tortuguita's cause of death as \"multiple gunshot wounds\" and the manner of death as a \"homicide.\" Coroners regularly use the word \"homicide\" to simply mean a death at the hands of another, not as a criminal law term for wrongdoing.\n\nTortuguita was deemed to be in good health, with no \"pre-existing natural disease,\" according to the autopsy.\n\nAmong the devastating shots was one that \"passed through and collapsed the right eye globe and then entered the cranial cavity through the right orbital roof,\" according to the autopsy report.\n\n\"The gunshot wounds involved the head, torso, and the bilateral upper and lower extremities including the hands and right foot,\" it concluded.\n\n\"Collectively, the gunshots resulted in his death and therefore the cause of death is designated as multiple gunshot wounds. However, the gunshot wound to the head would have been fatal by itself.\"\n\nSenior Breaking News Reporter\n\nDennis Romero is a breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

As a rowdy pro-Trump mob tried to force their way into the Capitol on Jan. 6, a Capitol Police lieutenant emerged out of the Columbus Doors on the eastern side of the building, where windows had been shattered by the mob. Following a civilian in a brown Eddie Bauer jacket with a police bullhorn, the lieutenant led a procession of officers in riot gear down the stairs and through the crowd.\n\nAs the officer made his way through the sea of rioters, he put on a red MAGA hat. Trump supporters on the stairs celebrated, thinking that officers were giving up the building and that perhaps Donald Trump was going to remain president after all.\n\n\"Make a hole! They're leaving!\" one man yells in one of many videos that captured the moment. \"The cops are leaving! We won!\" says another. A man slaps the police officers' helmets in support, as others slap them on the back. A woman in a USA sweatshirt hugs the officers, who do not hug her back as they make their way out of the Capitol and through the crowd. Through their face shields, none of the cops looks thrilled. A man in a black QAnon hoodie and a Trump hat blesses the officers as they go down the stairs.\n\nStephen Ayres , a Capitol rioter and later a defendant who testified before the Jan. 6 committee, is there, watching from the sides. So is the \" QAnon Shaman ,\" Jacob Chansley, fresh off a visit to the Senate chamber that would later lead to a sentence of more than three years in prison.\n\nStanding at the bottom of the stairs, as police in riot gear march out, is 37-year-old Roberto Minuta of Texas. \"That's the police being escorted by the people, that's what that is, cause it's our f---ing building,\" says Minuta, filming the scene on his phone. \"Escorted!\"\n\nThe man escorting them, with the bullhorn in the Eddie Bauer jacket, was a member of the far-right Oath Keepers organization. Video from earlier in the day shows him flashing what appears to be a police badge at the officer and offering to help.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on the officer in the MAGA hat - Tarik Khalid \"T.K.\" Johnson, a former Capitol Police lieutenant - in the days after Jan. 6, but questions remain about what exactly happened on the Capitol steps that day. Some saw it as evidence of a far too cozy relationship between law enforcement and the Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol, while others on the right, including some lawyers for members of the Oath Keepers now on trial for seditious conspiracy, argue it is evidence that members of the Oath Keepers assisted law enforcement on Jan. 6 and that the charges against them are overblown.\n\nBut an NBC News review of the incident doesn't align with those narratives. NBC News, with help from a group of open-source researchers that have focused on the Oath Keepers, reviewed multiple videos of the moment and spoke with Johnson's lawyer and with Michael Nichols, the Oath Keeper and retired police officer who assisted the Capitol Police that day.\n\nJohnson put on the MAGA cap as a ruse to get people in the crowd to help him, his lawyer confirmed. He was trying to rescue over a dozen officers who were pinned down inside the Capitol, caught between rioters who had already broken into the building and a flood of other Trump supporters who had breached a door and were trying to push their way in.\n\nAnd it seems he succeeded. Once the officers were safely out of the way, other officers were able to temporarily shut the doors, which rioters had breached by taking advantage of the fire exit mechanism, which allowed them to open the magnetically-locked doors by pushing a bar for three seconds. The officers Johnson rescued were then able to redeploy elsewhere in the Capitol, Johnson's lawyer said.\n\nJohnson, who was demoted in connection with the incident, recently resigned from the U.S. Capitol Police, NBC News learned.\n\nNichols does not appear to have any ties to the Oath Keepers charged with seditious conspiracy, and there is no evidence he communicated with them before the Jan. 6 attack, despite their defense lawyers' arguments, in court and in the press, that his assistance to Johnson helps their case.\n\nEleven members of the Oath Keepers - an anti-government group primarily consisting of former members of law enforcement and the military that formed after the election of Barack Obama as president - are facing seditious conspiracy charges in connection with their conduct on Jan. 6, including Minuta, who filmed Nichols and Johnson descending the steps with the rescued officers. Five of those members - Elmer Stewart Rhodes III, Kelly Meggs, Kenneth Harrelson, Jessica Watkins and Thomas Caldwell - are currently on trial after pleading not guilty. A second group of Oath Keeper defendants - Minuta, Joseph Hackett, David Moerschel, and Edward Vallejo - are scheduled to go to trial at the end of the year.\n\nThree other Oath Keepers - Joshua James , Brian Ulrich and William Todd Wilson - have already pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy. Wilson is expected to testify that Rhodes, the leader of the Oath Keepers, tried to speak directly with Trump on Jan. 6 when they were in a hotel suite after the Capitol riot and that Rhodes was imploring his Trump contact to tell the then-president to call upon groups like the Oath Keepers.\n\nDefense lawyers have argued that video of Nichols helping law enforcement undermines the government's case that the Oath Keepers conspired in advance to overthrow the U.S. government on Jan. 6. \"Video of Oath Keepers Rescuing 16 Police Officers Deflates Jan. 6 Sedition Narrative, Attorneys Say,\" declares a headline in the far-right Epoch Times , one of many conservative outlets that has spread disinformation about Jan. 6. Members of the second \"stack\" of Oath Keepers charged, which includes Minuta, assisted the rescued officers once they reached the bottom of the stairs, their lawyers have argued. That group \"provided security and escort to overwhelmed Capitol police officers and assisted them in escaping that immediate threat and danger,\" Rhodes' attorneys wrote in one filing.\n\nBut the rescue effort was led by Nichols and there's no evidence that he was coordinating that day with Oath Keepers who have been charged. Barring some unforeseen development, it's unlikely Nichols will be charged himself after he proactively assisted law enforcement on Jan. 6.\n\nNichols said he's been visited by the FBI twice: in January 2021, and last September. He says he was questioned about his connections to the Oath Keepers organization, whether he was communicating with anyone via radio, and whether there were plans to attack the Capitol again. \"I'm like, whoa, we were there for a speech,\" Nichols said. An FBI official declined to comment on Nichols.\n\n\"They wanted to connect me to these groups and connect me to these things that I'm not a part of,\" Nichols said. \"I'm an American soldier and a retired police officer, and I'll stand up for anyone at any time, and that's it. I don't know Stewart Rhodes, I don't know any of those people. ... I wasn't communicating with any of these people.\"\n\n\"You might be a Boy Scout but you don't know all the Boy Scouts in the world,\" Nichols said.\n\nNichols had a great spot for Donald Trump's speech at the Ellipse on the morning of Jan. 6; video shows him and his wife toward the front of the crowd. They stayed for the whole thing, too: video shows he's still there when \" YMCA \" begins to play after Trump told his supporters to march down Pennsylvania Avenue toward the Capitol when his speech wrapped up around 1:10 p.m.‚ just after the first barricades were breached on the western front of the Capitol grounds.\n\nBut Nichols and his wife didn't go immediately to the Capitol, he said. First they walked around a bit, intending to head back to their hotel in Arlington, and then wound up at some food trucks, he said in an interview. Video shows him walking down toward the Capitol, hand-in-hand with his wife. It's more than a mile and a half from the White House to the Capitol, so walking can take awhile, even without crowds and a pit stop. Given the timing of Trump's speech, Nichols would've arrived at the Capitol long after the barricades were gone, having been breached by the mob on the east side of the Capitol at about 2 p.m.\n\n\"There were no barricades, there were no officers, there were just people wandering around, so we just wandered around,\" Nichols told NBC News. They made their way to the east side of the Capitol, where Nichols said they joined a group that was praying and singing Christian music on a staircase leading to the Senate, which is confirmed by video viewed by NBC News.\n\nNichols said that going to the Capitol wasn't on his agenda on Jan. 6, and his wife posted that he went with her because he \"knew how important it was to me for us to be a part of this incredible moment.\"\n\nNichols said he saw a commotion at the top of the stairs as rioters tried to break into the Capitol and tried to help. That's when he saw Johnson.\n\n\"I've got to let him know and see if I can help him get this crowd off the stairs,\" Nichols said he thought.\n\nVideo captures what happened next. Johnson, sporting the MAGA hat, tells Nichols and another man that officers are getting beat up and tries to portray himself as a like-minded conservative, saying that \"the people who didn't vote for him [Trump] are laughing at us.\" (Johnson's lawyer confirmed reports that he is a Democrat.)\n\n\"How can we help to take control?\" Nichols asks. Johnson asks for help extracting officers from inside. Nichols says he can help, flashes a badge and makes a plan with the officer to head up the stairs. \"You can even use my megaphone, and I'll follow you,\" Johnson tells Nichols.\n\nThey make their way up the stairs, at points hand-in-hand. Another man accompanying Nichols and Johnson tells one bystander that they're Oath Keepers; that man has not been charged either. The three men make their way to the doors, and before long, begin escorting a group of officers out of the building and down the stairs, where Minuta is waiting with his phone.\n\nUnlike the colleagues behind him, Johnson has no additional protective gear on him, unless you count his blue medical mask. He was also more vulnerable: a Black officer amid a mob that included neo-Nazis, Confederate flags and - as court documents have made clear - plenty of fascists and racists.\n\nMultiple Black officers and first responders have said they were the subject of racist taunts that day, and an attorney for Johnson said at least one video shows a rioter using a racial slur to refer to the lieutenant during the rescue, telling others in the mob: \"That n----- is tricking us.\" Johnson did not hear the slur himself that day, his lawyer said.\n\nMoments after the men came down the stairs, police were able to - temporarily, at least - secure the east rotunda door, preventing more rioters from entering or re-entering the Capitol.\n\nAs the day wore on, Nichols returned to the door. There's video of him, without audio, that shows him speaking to rioters near the door of the Capitol and then talking at length to police officers through the door - he says he was trying to calm the situation and help police close the door, which wasn't locking.\n\n\"There was like a broken piece of metal that was stuck to the magnet part way up above where it would have locked the doors,\" Nichols said.\n\nNichols identified himself as former law enforcement and one of the officers asked him if he could shut the larger, decorative Columbus doors, he said. But those heavy doors wouldn't budge, and the crowd started to turn on him. Nichols decided to leave because there wasn't much more he could do to help, he said, and he was worried that he or his wife would be hurt. They went down and found Johnson again and told him what was happening, a moment that is also captured in a photo reviewed by NBC News.\n\nNichols is a former police officer in Cortland, New York, outside of Syracuse. Lt. Dan Edwards of the Cortland Police confirmed that Nichols retired in February 2017 and that the department does give out retirement badges like the one that Nichols appeared to flash during his exchange with Johnson.\n\nIn the wake of the attack, Johnson was demoted for donning the MAGA hat. \"Mr. Johnson contested the disciplinary process - including the demotion,\" Johnson's attorney said.\n\n\"A thorough investigation found he [Johnson] did not help the rioters before, during or after the attack. The Department took appropriate actions to address the official's conduct about his personal decisions and the acceptance of the hat,\" the U.S. Capitol Police said in a statement to NBC News. \"It is important to remember that our officers fought like hell that day to win back the Capitol so Congress could carry out their legislative duties.\"\n\nTwo officers who served on Jan. 6 said that while some on the force certainly questioned the wisdom of Johnson's techniques, nobody questioned that he had the right intent that day: protecting officers and securing the Capitol.\n\nJohnson's lawyer said that he helped \"to rescue U.S. Capitol Police officers from then being surrounded and subject to life-threatening attacks by the rioters (who already had gravely assaulted and threatened to kill other USCP officers on the Capitol West Front, who then were defending against the rioters' intrusions\" before he provided tactical guidance on the eastern side of the Capitol until rioters dispersed.\n\nJohnson wasn't aware that Nichols was an Oath Keeper, nor of who the Oath Keepers were, his lawyer said.\n\nGus Papathanasiou, the chairman of the U.S. Capitol Police Labor Committee, told NBC News that he does not believe any USCP officer should have been disciplined for their actions on Jan. 6 since no higher ups in management were disciplined. Papathanasiou's union did not represent Johnson in the incident because Johnson was a lieutenant at the time, but he said that the union was \"fighting for officers who've been disciplined relating to January 6th\" and that Johnson's actions were honorable.\n\n\"From what I've seen on social media video of T.K. Johnson and what I heard on the radio that day, T.K. should have been ‎promoted after Jan 6th, not demoted,\" Papathanasiou said, calling the department's treatment of him \"a travesty.\"\n\nNichols said that he thought Johnson went \"above and beyond\" and \"put his life\" at risk on Jan. 6.\n\n\"He was on his radio, he was calling for instruction, and they were just left with no resources there,\" Nichols said.\n\nJohnson's lawyer said that the then-lieutenant spent the first hour of the attack giving tactical direction to more than 20 officers and was \"instrumental, through his initiative, in evacuating Senators and their staffs from the Senate Chamber and then, a few minutes later, evacuating House Members and their staffs from the House Chamber - all just shortly before the rioters entered those Chambers in search of Senators and House Members.\"\n\nAfter Johnson returned to duty demoted from his position as a lieutenant, but \"in good standing as a USCP police officer,\" his lawyer said that he decided to resign, effective Sept. 23.\n\nThe Oath Keepers charged in the seditious conspiracy, according to the government's evidence, came prepared on Jan. 6. Rhodes, the leader, set up quick reaction forces - or \"QRFs\" - outside of D.C., prosecutors say, and spoke with a Trump associate the night of Jan. 6, urging the person to put him in contact with Trump and to have Trump call upon groups like the Oath Keepers to keep him in power.\n\nIt's unclear how much of Nichols' and Johnson's cooperation the Oath Keepers' lawyers will be able to work into the first trial, given that this set of defendants don't appear to have interacted with Johnson. The judge overseeing the Oath Keepers case said that the evidence can be introduced only if the defendants witnessed it directly. Brad Geyer, an attorney for defendant Harrelson, told NBC News after opening arguments on Monday that he was going to try to bring in as much evidence about the incident as he could.\n\nAlthough Nichols draws a distinction between himself as an \"oathkeeper\" - someone who swore an oath to protect and defend the country -  and the Oath Keepers organization, of which he is a member, he gets defensive about those members who have been charged.\n\nHe said he was under the impression they went there to protect speakers at events surrounding Jan. 6, not overthrow the government.\n\n\"I don't know those people,\" Nichols said. \"I don't know what anyone's mindset is, but based on my understanding of it, they're being scapegoated.\"\n\nRyan J. Reilly is a justice reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Today, the climate change conference kicked off in Baku, Azerbaijan. In another part of the program, we are hearing about the speeches and policy agenda. Right now, let's get a sense of what it feels like to be at the summit from Laura Young. Her followers on social media know her as Less Waste Laura. She is a Ph.D. climate researcher and climate activist from Glasgow, Scotland, and she's attending the summit in Baku. Welcome. LAURA YOUNG: Hello. Thanks for having me. SHAPIRO: It's a pleasure to have you. When I've been to COP summits in the past, there's often something like a festival vibe, with huge installations of sculpture and video, and people gathering for protests and speeches. What's the atmosphere like there in Baku today? YOUNG: Yeah. I mean, the first day, you basically spend your whole day running about, trying to find out where's the toilets... SHAPIRO: (Laughter). YOUNG: ...How do you get on the Wi-Fi and trying to find all the different rooms. But of course, you are surrounded by different side events, pavilions. So there's the Arctic pavilion, there's the Canadian and the U.S. pavilion, but you also have pavilions for soil and water and all sorts of different things. And obviously, it's an exciting day. There's two weeks of negotiations ahead of us, so you are there with anticipation, wanting to know what is happening. SHAPIRO: Yeah. YOUNG: But of course, we also know that we are coming into this one with a couple of negatives. We know that there's lots of world leaders who haven't made the effort to come. And we know that America has recently had a big election, which is going to undoubtedly impact climate policy at this global level. So we're coming in a little bit on the back foot with these things. But of course, there's still that excitement around what the possibilities will be for this conference. SHAPIRO: Is there one conversation that you find yourself having over and over with every new person you meet? YOUNG: Oh, I mean, Trump - that's definitely something that keeps coming up time and time again. Everybody is wondering, you know, what is going to be happening with the U.S. election. How is that going to impact global policy? And I think that's probably the biggest thing that's on the agenda at the moment. SHAPIRO: So many world leaders are not attending this COP summit - the U.S., Canada, India, Russia, Brazil. They've sent representatives, but how are people reacting to the fact that the big bosses are off doing other things? YOUNG: It's frustrating because people have made long journeys to get here. And actually, the history of COP, we didn't used to have the world leaders' summit at the beginning. We didn't used to bring the heads of state. But what we realized, particularly after Paris when we got the big Paris Agreement, that actually having the world leaders at the conference made such a big difference for the ambition, for the influence, for the energy. And by putting that right at the beginning, it helps set a tone - almost a bit of a competitive edge, right? Countries want to look like they are leading in this space. And so by these countries pulling back or not making it a priority, that sends a big message, particularly when these are some of the biggest-emitting countries in terms of carbon, but also these are some of the big funders, the ones who could potentially make a big difference. SHAPIRO: Yeah. Having been to a few COPs, do you feel more or less hopeful now than you have in previous years? YOUNG: Oh, I mean, catch me on a good day, and I might squeak in I feel hopeful. But it is really, really difficult because ultimately, we know that we are still not making the difference that we can. But also, if we didn't have these COP processes, we would be a lot worse off. This is the only conference where everybody around the world gets a seat at the table and has a conversation and makes commitments. So we absolutely need to have it, but there's, of course, space that we need reform. And also, this is the second oil state to now host this conference. Last year it was in Dubai. This year, it's Baku. You definitely feel the influence that fossil fuels have had on the conference. SHAPIRO: Could you leave us with one memorable image or scene from your first day there in Baku - something that'll stick with you? YOUNG: Well, I did see a Santa Claus going around and talking about how (laughter) the North Pole is going to be impacted by climate change, which actually felt a bit quirky. I kind of liked it. SHAPIRO: (Laughter) The elves' workshop is melting, that kind of thing? YOUNG: Uh-huh. And actually, I thought if this doesn't get you on board... SHAPIRO: (Laughter). YOUNG: ...I don't know what will. But to be honest, there's really powerful stuff, and I think that's what I like about this, is there's artists that are here. There's people who have got photography exhibitions. There's people who are doing stuff that's really creative because we know that what comes out of COP is text-heavy, hard-hitting, quite boring legal jargon. But actually, when you come here, you also get people who are doing it creatively. So whether that is the arts, the theater, or whether that's Santa talking about the North Pole, but it sticks with you. SHAPIRO: That's climate researcher Laura Young, aka Less Waste Laura, speaking with us from the COP summit in Baku, Azerbaijan. Thank you so much. YOUNG: Thank you very much. Copyright © 2024 NPR.

When I've been to COP summits in the past, there's often something like a festival vibe, with huge installations of sculpture and video, and people gathering for protests and speeches. What's the atmosphere like there in Baku today? YOUNG: Yeah. I mean, the first day, you basically spend your whole day running about, trying to find out where's the toilets... SHAPIRO: (Laughter). YOUNG: ...How do you get on the Wi-Fi and trying to find all the different rooms. But of course, you are surrounded by different side events, pavilions. So there's the Arctic pavilion, there's the Canadian and the U.S. pavilion, but you also have pavilions for soil and water and all sorts of different things. And obviously, it's an exciting day. There's two weeks of negotiations ahead of us, so you are there with anticipation, wanting to know what is happening. SHAPIRO: Yeah. YOUNG: But of course, we also know that we are coming into this one with a couple of negatives. We know that there's lots of world leaders who haven't made the effort to come. And we know that America has recently had a big election, which is going to undoubtedly impact climate policy at this global level. So we're coming in a little bit on the back foot with these things. But of course, there's still that excitement around what the possibilities will be for this conference. SHAPIRO: Is there one conversation that you find yourself having over and over with every new person you meet? YOUNG: Oh, I mean, Trump - that's definitely something that keeps coming up time and time again. Everybody is wondering, you know, what is going to be happening with the U.S. election. How is that going to impact global policy? And I think that's probably the biggest thing that's on the agenda at the moment. SHAPIRO: So many world leaders are not attending this COP summit - the U.S., Canada, India, Russia, Brazil. They've sent representatives, but how are people reacting to the fact that the big bosses are off doing other things? YOUNG: It's frustrating because people have made long journeys to get here. And actually, the history of COP, we didn't used to have the world leaders' summit at the beginning. We didn't used to bring the heads of state. But what we realized, particularly after Paris when we got the big Paris Agreement, that actually having the world leaders at the conference made such a big difference for the ambition, for the influence, for the energy. And by putting that right at the beginning, it helps set a tone - almost a bit of a competitive edge, right? Countries want to look like they are leading in this space. And so by these countries pulling back or not making it a priority, that sends a big message, particularly when these are some of the biggest-emitting countries in terms of carbon, but also these are some of the big funders, the ones who could potentially make a big difference. SHAPIRO: Yeah. Having been to a few COPs, do you feel more or less hopeful now than you have in previous years? YOUNG: Oh, I mean, catch me on a good day, and I might squeak in I feel hopeful. But it is really, really difficult because ultimately, we know that we are still not making the difference that we can. But also, if we didn't have these COP processes, we would be a lot worse off. This is the only conference where everybody around the world gets a seat at the table and has a conversation and makes commitments. So we absolutely need to have it, but there's, of course, space that we need reform. And also, this is the second oil state to now host this conference. Last year it was in Dubai. This year, it's Baku. You definitely feel the influence that fossil fuels have had on the conference. SHAPIRO: Could you leave us with one memorable image or scene from your first day there in Baku - something that'll stick with you? YOUNG: Well, I did see a Santa Claus going around and talking about how (laughter) the North Pole is going to be impacted by climate change, which actually felt a bit quirky. I kind of liked it. SHAPIRO: (Laughter) The elves' workshop is melting, that kind of thing? YOUNG: Uh-huh. And actually, I thought if this doesn't get you on board... SHAPIRO: (Laughter). YOUNG: ...I don't know what will. But to be honest, there's really powerful stuff, and I think that's what I like about this, is there's artists that are here. There's people who have got photography exhibitions. There's people who are doing stuff that's really creative because we know that what comes out of COP is text-heavy, hard-hitting, quite boring legal jargon. But actually, when you come here, you also get people who are doing it creatively. So whether that is the arts, the theater, or whether that's Santa talking about the North Pole, but it sticks with you.

SHAPIRO: So many world leaders are not attending this COP summit - the U.S., Canada, India, Russia, Brazil. They've sent representatives, but how are people reacting to the fact that the big bosses are off doing other things? YOUNG: It's frustrating because people have made long journeys to get here. And actually, the history of COP, we didn't used to have the world leaders' summit at the beginning. We didn't used to bring the heads of state. But what we realized, particularly after Paris when we got the big Paris Agreement, that actually having the world leaders at the conference made such a big difference for the ambition, for the influence, for the energy. And by putting that right at the beginning, it helps set a tone - almost a bit of a competitive edge, right? Countries want to look like they are leading in this space. And so by these countries pulling back or not making it a priority, that sends a big message, particularly when these are some of the biggest-emitting countries in terms of carbon, but also these are some of the big funders, the ones who could potentially make a big difference. SHAPIRO: Yeah. Having been to a few COPs, do you feel more or less hopeful now than you have in previous years? YOUNG: Oh, I mean, catch me on a good day, and I might squeak in I feel hopeful. But it is really, really difficult because ultimately, we know that we are still not making the difference that we can. But also, if we didn't have these COP processes, we would be a lot worse off. This is the only conference where everybody around the world gets a seat at the table and has a conversation and makes commitments. So we absolutely need to have it, but there's, of course, space that we need reform. And also, this is the second oil state to now host this conference. Last year it was in Dubai. This year, it's Baku. You definitely feel the influence that fossil fuels have had on the conference. SHAPIRO: Could you leave us with one memorable image or scene from your first day there in Baku - something that'll stick with you? YOUNG: Well, I did see a Santa Claus going around and talking about how (laughter) the North Pole is going to be impacted by climate change, which actually felt a bit quirky. I kind of liked it. SHAPIRO: (Laughter) The elves' workshop is melting, that kind of thing? YOUNG: Uh-huh. And actually, I thought if this doesn't get you on board... SHAPIRO: (Laughter). YOUNG: ...I don't know what will. But to be honest, there's really powerful stuff, and I think that's what I like about this, is there's artists that are here. There's people who have got photography exhibitions. There's people who are doing stuff that's really creative because we know that what comes out of COP is text-heavy, hard-hitting, quite boring legal jargon. But actually, when you come here, you also get people who are doing it creatively. So whether that is the arts, the theater, or whether that's Santa talking about the North Pole, but it sticks with you. SHAPIRO: That's climate researcher Laura Young, aka Less Waste Laura, speaking with us from the COP summit in Baku, Azerbaijan. Thank you so much. YOUNG: Thank you very much. Copyright © 2024 NPR.

But of course, you are surrounded by different side events, pavilions.

There's two weeks of negotiations ahead of us, so you are there with anticipation, wanting to know what is happening. SHAPIRO: Yeah. YOUNG: But of course, we also know that we are coming into this one with a couple of negatives. We know that there's lots of world leaders who haven't made the effort to come. And we know that America has recently had a big election, which is going to undoubtedly impact climate policy at this global level. So we're coming in a little bit on the back foot with these things.

And so by these countries pulling back or not making it a priority, that sends a big message, particularly when these are some of the biggest-emitting countries in terms of carbon, but also these are some of the big funders, the ones who could potentially make a big difference. SHAPIRO: Yeah. Having been to a few COPs, do you feel more or less hopeful now than you have in previous years? YOUNG: Oh, I mean, catch me on a good day, and I might squeak in I feel hopeful. But it is really, really difficult because ultimately, we know that we are still not making the difference that we can. But also, if we didn't have these COP processes, we would be a lot worse off. This is the only conference where everybody around the world gets a seat at the table and has a conversation and makes commitments. So we absolutely need to have it, but there's, of course, space that we need reform. And also, this is the second oil state to now host this conference. Last year it was in Dubai. This year, it's Baku. You definitely feel the influence that fossil fuels have had on the conference. SHAPIRO: Could you leave us with one memorable image or scene from your first day there in Baku - something that'll stick with you? YOUNG: Well, I did see a Santa Claus going around and talking about how (laughter) the North Pole is going to be impacted by climate change, which actually felt a bit quirky. I kind of liked it. SHAPIRO: (Laughter) The elves' workshop is melting, that kind of thing? YOUNG: Uh-huh. And actually, I thought if this doesn't get you on board... SHAPIRO: (Laughter). YOUNG: ...I don't know what will. But to be honest, there's really powerful stuff, and I think that's what I like about this, is there's artists that are here. There's people who have got photography exhibitions. There's people who are doing stuff that's really creative because we know that what comes out of COP is text-heavy, hard-hitting, quite boring legal jargon. But actually, when you come here, you also get people who are doing it creatively. So whether that is the arts, the theater, or whether that's Santa talking about the North Pole, but it sticks with you. SHAPIRO: That's climate researcher Laura Young, aka Less Waste Laura, speaking with us from the COP summit in Baku, Azerbaijan. Thank you so much. YOUNG: Thank you very much. Copyright © 2024 NPR.

YOUNG: ...I don't know what will. But to be honest, there's really powerful stuff, and I think that's what I like about this, is there's artists that are here. There's people who have got photography exhibitions. There's people who are doing stuff that's really creative because we know that what comes out of COP is text-heavy, hard-hitting, quite boring legal jargon. But actually, when you come here, you also get people who are doing it creatively. So whether that is the arts, the theater, or whether that's Santa talking about the North Pole, but it sticks with you. SHAPIRO: That's climate researcher Laura Young, aka Less Waste Laura, speaking with us from the COP summit in Baku, Azerbaijan. Thank you so much. YOUNG: Thank you very much. Copyright © 2024 NPR.

YOUNG: Oh, I mean, catch me on a good day, and I might squeak in I feel hopeful. But it is really, really difficult because ultimately, we know that we are still not making the difference that we can. But also, if we didn't have these COP processes, we would be a lot worse off. This is the only conference where everybody around the world gets a seat at the table and has a conversation and makes commitments. So we absolutely need to have it, but there's, of course, space that we need reform. And also, this is the second oil state to now host this conference. Last year it was in Dubai. This year, it's Baku. You definitely feel the influence that fossil fuels have had on the conference. SHAPIRO: Could you leave us with one memorable image or scene from your first day there in Baku - something that'll stick with you?

      "text": "Confessions of a continuity cop\n\nLinda Holmes\n\nYou know that scene in Pretty Woman when Julia Roberts is eating a croissant that suddenly turns into a pancake? Continuity issues like that crop up all the time. Whether you let it distract you is your call.\n\nI was watching a screener of an upcoming TV show this week when I became distracted. The scene involved a woman in bed with her husband discussing some plans they had, and in one shot, the sheet the woman had pulled up to her armpits (you know, as you do, ladies, to make sure your husband does not see you naked) had slipped down far enough that it seemed like it was threatening to become a more realistic depiction of the marital bed. But then they cut to her husband, and when they cut back to her, the sheet was dutifully up under her armpits again, keeping her fully covered. Back and forth they went. The sheet went up, the sheet went down, shot to shot.\n\nIt's not that I don't know how this happens - it's not that we all don't know how this happens. Of course they need multiple takes of a scene. Of course they sometimes mix parts of both takes, and of course no matter how careful people try to be in the moment, you can't catch every single thing that could possibly change. From time to time, you'll see a pretty big one that it is funny they couldn't avoid, like when Julia Roberts' croissant turns into a pancake in Pretty Woman .\n\nBut mostly, I freely recognize that being aware of this kind of detail makes one seem like a joyless dweeb. I wish I could help it.\n\nIt wasn't until someone pointed it out to me this week that I realized that this is indeed probably why some reality shows - notably Love Is Blind - provide contestants with shiny metal (and opaque) vessels to drink out of. I had actually wondered what the show thinks it's accomplishing with all of its golden wine glasses, whether they thought this was classy, whether this was a trend I didn't know about, whether I needed metal wine glasses in my life. But no - this is, I'm sure, exactly it. They don't want to fuss with beverage levels on a show where people are constantly drinking and need to be heavily edited.\n\nI think everyone who watches a lot of TV and movies has pet peeves - critic Myles McNutt is somewhat famous for his obsession with people holding or drinking out of obviously empty cups . (Seriously: Myles is a terrific writer , but there was a time when, to many people, he was That Guy Who Has That Thing About The Cups.)\n\nPerhaps it is best thought of as a moment when the realities of making television or films collide with the illusion of them. And perhaps it's a salute, really, to the seamlessness with which a viewing brain can accept that scene of the woman with her sheet demurely wrapped around her, or that scene of the beautiful couple having breakfast. When I am focused enough on a scene that I notice somebody's hair moving from hanging behind her shoulder to hanging in front of her shoulder, at least I'm engaged in what I'm watching.\n\nAnd so I, a Continuity Cop, resolve to keep my siren quiet as much as possible. I can barely remember where my morning coffee is half the time; I can't imagine trying to remember how high the sheet was the last time a scene was filmed.\n\nThis piece also appeared in NPR's Pop Culture Happy Hour newsletter.

She plays a police officer investigating the murders of women from Philadelphia's Kensington neighborhood.\n\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Amanda Seyfried's career has transformed in the last decade. Twenty years ago, she got famous playing bubbly roles in movies like \"Mamma Mia!\" and \"Mean Girls.\" Now, she's known for showing serious acting chops in projects like \"The Dropout,\" where she played disgraced Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes and won an Emmy. Her new show is an eight-part series for Peacock called \"Long Bright River.\" Seyfried plays a cop and a single mom investigating a string of murders in the rough Philadelphia neighborhood where the character grew up. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"LONG BRIGHT RIVER\") AMANDA SEYFRIED: (As Mickey) Three bodies discovered in four days, similar demographics on the victims, and one of them might have been murdered. If there's a bad batch of something out there, then these girls need to know what it is. If there isn't, that they need to know to watch their backs. SHAPIRO: Amanda Seyfried, welcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. SEYFRIED: Thanks. SHAPIRO: You're an executive producer... SEYFRIED: First time. SHAPIRO: Is it? I can't believe it's your first time. Honestly... SEYFRIED: Yeah. SHAPIRO: ...Given the number of major projects you've done, I'm a little embarrassed that it's taken us this long to have you on the show. SEYFRIED: No, I'm - no, it's - listen, everything in its right time. SHAPIRO: You were building up your whole career for this - this moment. SEYFRIED: Yes. SHAPIRO: (Laughter). SEYFRIED: Yes. Exactly. SHAPIRO: You're an executive producer as well as a star of this show. Why did you want to take it on? SEYFRIED: I wanted to be a cop. SHAPIRO: (Laughter) Really? SEYFRIED: Yep. I wanted to put that belt on. I wanted to put the uniform on. I wanted to portray a cop. This - like, my whole career... SHAPIRO: Lifelong dream, or woke up... SEYFRIED: Yeah. SHAPIRO: ...One morning recently and decided? Like... SEYFRIED: I think it's been a lifelong dream. And it was one of those really impossible goals for me because I was the ingenue for a long time, and I just never saw myself as someone who could even pretend to have authority. So once I started playing roles - like, I played a lawyer once - it almost felt like a joke. You know, it almost felt like if I couldn't believe it, how is anyone else going to believe it? And this was finally a point in my career in which I felt that I was ready to tackle this - my own internal struggle - with authority and how I feel about myself. So I was like, this is a cop who's my age, has a kid and lives in a place that - very close to where I grew up, so it felt... SHAPIRO: Yeah. SEYFRIED: ...Kind of natural. SHAPIRO: It's set in this rough Philadelphia neighborhood of Kensington, where your character grew up, and you grew up just over an hour's drive away from there, in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Did you have a sense of what this place was like before you started working on the project? SEYFRIED: I knew Philly. I know Philly quite well. I know certain parts of Philly. It was a cultural hot spot for me. And having grown up - like, that was the closest big city so that we just - we would visit for culture. But I never had heard of Kensington until - I mean, I must have been well into my 20s when Kensington was - it was known as the hotspot for the opioid epidemic. SHAPIRO: Right. SEYFRIED: And I think, like most people, I only understood it for one thing. And that's part of the reason why I think Liz Moore's book, \"Long Bright River,\" did so well is because she wrote about an honest account and a new perspective on a community that is so marginalized and so feared and avoided because of the suffering, the addiction on the streets, the unhoused people, the sex workers, and not as a community that's actually quite resilient and a community of people who protect each other and kind of move like a well-oiled machine in some ways because they do look after each other. And so... SHAPIRO: Yeah. SEYFRIED: ...I think it was just - opened people's eyes to all these neighborhoods that we don't want to set foot in. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"LONG BRIGHT RIVER\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) How could somebody choose to live like that? SEYFRIED: (As Mickey) Like what? UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) This neighborhood used to be normal, man. We used to play baseball here with our kids. Sure, it was rough and tumble, but nothing like this. SEYFRIED: (As Mickey) Yeah, well, it's got its good parts, its bad parts, like any neighborhood. SHAPIRO: You know, your character is often the only woman in a room full of men, and the same could be said of Elizabeth Holmes, who you played a few years ago. Is there something that you especially connect with in that kind of a role? SEYFRIED: I think I'm always trying to evolve quickly through the people I play because I'm very well aware of the fact that I'm a people pleaser to a fault, and it gets in the way of my priorities. And it can make people in my life who are a priority feel less like a priority because I'm so anxious and aware of what I perceive as comfort for other people. And these two women, specifically Mickey, who's based on so many real people, and Elizabeth Holmes, who is a real person, they didn't waste their time trying to make other people comfortable. They just did what they needed to do when they needed to do it. And the more I play these people, the more aware I am of my failings, and I give myself grace, too. SHAPIRO: But it's so interesting to me to hear that these two characters, who are struggling with so many problems and have so much adversity and have so many challenges, are people who you, Amanda Seyfried, look up to in a way and... SEYFRIED: Absolutely. SHAPIRO: ...Aspire to be more like in a way. SEYFRIED: Well, also, when you're acting, when you're portraying somebody, a way to honor the work at hand and to make it really count is to empathize as much as humanly possible. Of course, we all have our opinions about Elizabeth Holmes. But she's a human being, and she's not all bad. She's a three-dimensional person, and we create stories to do that, to create some kind of space for these people to exist as three-dimensional people. And even though we're trying to enhance the situation for television, the point is to still get to know this person in a different way. SHAPIRO: So from where I sit, it looks to me like you have passed the point in your career where people say with surprise, wow, she can really do anything. Now, it's more like, yeah, we know she can do drama and comedy and musicals, and she's good at all of it. And so now that you have cleared that hurdle - or maybe you don't feel like you've cleared that hurdle, I'm not sure. But you've played the cop. You've checked that box. Like, if all of these paths are open to you, which paths look the most appealing next? SEYFRIED: The ones that couldn't be more different than the last character. But I do feel the respect in my industry, and it's wonderful. I don't feel like I have anything to prove. I didn't take on roles in my 30s to prove anything, but in my 20s, that's all I did. SHAPIRO: (Laughter) Yeah. SEYFRIED: So I feel like it's been a good, you know, almost 10 years where I've had more fun and had - some years, I would have more opportunities than others, depending on, you know, what hits and what doesn't. It's all a crapshoot. But I always stayed true to why I made these choices. You know when something's unique. SHAPIRO: Yeah. SEYFRIED: And I don't need to prove anything. I just want to do something different. I just don't want to be bored. SHAPIRO: Well, Amanda Seyfried, it has been such a pleasure talking to you today. SEYFRIED: Thanks. SHAPIRO: Thank you very much. SEYFRIED: Thank you. You're so gentle, and I love your voice. And I love this show. SHAPIRO: Oh, thank you. SEYFRIED: So thanks for everything. SHAPIRO: Well, the feeling is mutual.

And so now that you have cleared that hurdle - or maybe you don't feel like you've cleared that hurdle, I'm not sure. But you've played the cop. You've checked that box. Like, if all of these paths are open to you, which paths look the most appealing next? SEYFRIED: The ones that couldn't be more different than the last character. But I do feel the respect in my industry, and it's wonderful. I don't feel like I have anything to prove. I didn't take on roles in my 30s to prove anything, but in my 20s, that's all I did. SHAPIRO: (Laughter) Yeah. SEYFRIED: So I feel like it's been a good, you know, almost 10 years where I've had more fun and had - some years, I would have more opportunities than others, depending on, you know, what hits and what doesn't. It's all a crapshoot. But I always stayed true to why I made these choices. You know when something's unique. SHAPIRO: Yeah. SEYFRIED: And I don't need to prove anything. I just want to do something different. I just don't want to be bored. SHAPIRO: Well, Amanda Seyfried, it has been such a pleasure talking to you today. SEYFRIED: Thanks. SHAPIRO: Thank you very much. SEYFRIED: Thank you. You're so gentle, and I love your voice. And I love this show. SHAPIRO: Oh, thank you. SEYFRIED: So thanks for everything. SHAPIRO: Well, the feeling is mutual.

If there's a bad batch of something out there, then these girls need to know what it is. If there isn't, that they need to know to watch their backs. SHAPIRO: Amanda Seyfried, welcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. SEYFRIED: Thanks. SHAPIRO: You're an executive producer... SEYFRIED: First time. SHAPIRO: Is it? I can't believe it's your first time. Honestly... SEYFRIED: Yeah. SHAPIRO: ...Given the number of major projects you've done, I'm a little embarrassed that it's taken us this long to have you on the show. SEYFRIED: No, I'm - no, it's - listen, everything in its right time. SHAPIRO: You were building up your whole career for this - this moment. SEYFRIED: Yes. SHAPIRO: (Laughter). SEYFRIED: Yes. Exactly. SHAPIRO: You're an executive producer as well as a star of this show. Why did you want to take it on? SEYFRIED: I wanted to be a cop. SHAPIRO: (Laughter) Really? SEYFRIED: Yep. I wanted to put that belt on. I wanted to put the uniform on. I wanted to portray a cop. This - like, my whole career... SHAPIRO: Lifelong dream, or woke up... SEYFRIED: Yeah. SHAPIRO: ...One morning recently and decided? Like... SEYFRIED: I think it's been a lifelong dream. And it was one of those really impossible goals for me because I was the ingenue for a long time, and I just never saw myself as someone who could even pretend to have authority. So once I started playing roles - like, I played a lawyer once - it almost felt like a joke. You know, it almost felt like if I couldn't believe it, how is anyone else going to believe it? And this was finally a point in my career in which I felt that I was ready to tackle this - my own internal struggle - with authority and how I feel about myself. So I was like, this is a cop who's my age, has a kid and lives in a place that - very close to where I grew up, so it felt... SHAPIRO: Yeah. SEYFRIED: ...Kind of natural. SHAPIRO: It's set in this rough Philadelphia neighborhood of Kensington, where your character grew up, and you grew up just over an hour's drive away from there, in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Did you have a sense of what this place was like before you started working on the project? SEYFRIED: I knew Philly. I know Philly quite well. I know certain parts of Philly. It was a cultural hot spot for me. And having grown up - like, that was the closest big city so that we just - we would visit for culture. But I never had heard of Kensington until - I mean, I must have been well into my 20s when Kensington was - it was known as the hotspot for the opioid epidemic. SHAPIRO: Right. SEYFRIED: And I think, like most people, I only understood it for one thing. And that's part of the reason why I think Liz Moore's book, \"Long Bright River,\" did so well is because she wrote about an honest account and a new perspective on a community that is so marginalized and so feared and avoided because of the suffering, the addiction on the streets, the unhoused people, the sex workers, and not as a community that's actually quite resilient and a community of people who protect each other and kind of move like a well-oiled machine in some ways because they do look after each other. And so... SHAPIRO: Yeah. SEYFRIED: ...I think it was just - opened people's eyes to all these neighborhoods that we don't want to set foot in. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"LONG BRIGHT RIVER\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) How could somebody choose to live like that? SEYFRIED: (As Mickey) Like what? UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) This neighborhood used to be normal, man. We used to play baseball here with our kids. Sure, it was rough and tumble, but nothing like this. SEYFRIED: (As Mickey) Yeah, well, it's got its good parts, its bad parts, like any neighborhood. SHAPIRO: You know, your character is often the only woman in a room full of men, and the same could be said of Elizabeth Holmes, who you played a few years ago. Is there something that you especially connect with in that kind of a role? SEYFRIED: I think I'm always trying to evolve quickly through the people I play because I'm very well aware of the fact that I'm a people pleaser to a fault, and it gets in the way of my priorities. And it can make people in my life who are a priority feel less like a priority because I'm so anxious and aware of what I perceive as comfort for other people. And these two women, specifically Mickey, who's based on so many real people, and Elizabeth Holmes, who is a real person, they didn't waste their time trying to make other people comfortable. They just did what they needed to do when they needed to do it. And the more I play these people, the more aware I am of my failings, and I give myself grace, too. SHAPIRO: But it's so interesting to me to hear that these two characters, who are struggling with so many problems and have so much adversity and have so many challenges, are people who you, Amanda Seyfried, look up to in a way and... SEYFRIED: Absolutely. SHAPIRO: ...Aspire to be more like in a way. SEYFRIED: Well, also, when you're acting, when you're portraying somebody, a way to honor the work at hand and to make it really count is to empathize as much as humanly possible. Of course, we all have our opinions about Elizabeth Holmes. But she's a human being, and she's not all bad. She's a three-dimensional person, and we create stories to do that, to create some kind of space for these people to exist as three-dimensional people. And even though we're trying to enhance the situation for television, the point is to still get to know this person in a different way. SHAPIRO: So from where I sit, it looks to me like you have passed the point in your career where people say with surprise, wow, she can really do anything. Now, it's more like, yeah, we know she can do drama and comedy and musicals, and she's good at all of it.

SEYFRIED: Absolutely. SHAPIRO: ...Aspire to be more like in a way. SEYFRIED: Well, also, when you're acting, when you're portraying somebody, a way to honor the work at hand and to make it really count is to empathize as much as humanly possible. Of course, we all have our opinions about Elizabeth Holmes. But she's a human being, and she's not all bad. She's a three-dimensional person, and we create stories to do that, to create some kind of space for these people to exist as three-dimensional people. And even though we're trying to enhance the situation for television, the point is to still get to know this person in a different way. SHAPIRO: So from where I sit, it looks to me like you have passed the point in your career where people say with surprise, wow, she can really do anything. Now, it's more like, yeah, we know she can do drama and comedy and musicals, and she's good at all of it. And so now that you have cleared that hurdle - or maybe you don't feel like you've cleared that hurdle, I'm not sure. But you've played the cop. You've checked that box. Like, if all of these paths are open to you, which paths look the most appealing next? SEYFRIED: The ones that couldn't be more different than the last character. But I do feel the respect in my industry, and it's wonderful. I don't feel like I have anything to prove. I didn't take on roles in my 30s to prove anything, but in my 20s, that's all I did. SHAPIRO: (Laughter) Yeah. SEYFRIED: So I feel like it's been a good, you know, almost 10 years where I've had more fun and had - some years, I would have more opportunities than others, depending on, you know, what hits and what doesn't. It's all a crapshoot. But I always stayed true to why I made these choices. You know when something's unique. SHAPIRO: Yeah. SEYFRIED: And I don't need to prove anything. I just want to do something different. I just don't want to be bored. SHAPIRO: Well, Amanda Seyfried, it has been such a pleasure talking to you today. SEYFRIED: Thanks. SHAPIRO: Thank you very much. SEYFRIED: Thank you. You're so gentle, and I love your voice. And I love this show. SHAPIRO: Oh, thank you. SEYFRIED: So thanks for everything. SHAPIRO: Well, the feeling is mutual.

SEYFRIED: First time. SHAPIRO: Is it? I can't believe it's your first time. Honestly... SEYFRIED: Yeah. SHAPIRO: ...Given the number of major projects you've done, I'm a little embarrassed that it's taken us this long to have you on the show. SEYFRIED: No, I'm - no, it's - listen, everything in its right time. SHAPIRO: You were building up your whole career for this - this moment. SEYFRIED: Yes. SHAPIRO: (Laughter). SEYFRIED: Yes. Exactly. SHAPIRO: You're an executive producer as well as a star of this show. Why did you want to take it on? SEYFRIED: I wanted to be a cop. SHAPIRO: (Laughter) Really? SEYFRIED: Yep. I wanted to put that belt on. I wanted to put the uniform on. I wanted to portray a cop. This - like, my whole career... SHAPIRO: Lifelong dream, or woke up... SEYFRIED: Yeah. SHAPIRO: ...One morning recently and decided? Like... SEYFRIED: I think it's been a lifelong dream. And it was one of those really impossible goals for me because I was the ingenue for a long time, and I just never saw myself as someone who could even pretend to have authority. So once I started playing roles - like, I played a lawyer once - it almost felt like a joke. You know, it almost felt like if I couldn't believe it, how is anyone else going to believe it? And this was finally a point in my career in which I felt that I was ready to tackle this - my own internal struggle - with authority and how I feel about myself. So I was like, this is a cop who's my age, has a kid and lives in a place that - very close to where I grew up, so it felt... SHAPIRO: Yeah. SEYFRIED: ...Kind of natural. SHAPIRO: It's set in this rough Philadelphia neighborhood of Kensington, where your character grew up, and you grew up just over an hour's drive away from there, in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Did you have a sense of what this place was like before you started working on the project? SEYFRIED: I knew Philly. I know Philly quite well. I know certain parts of Philly. It was a cultural hot spot for me. And having grown up - like, that was the closest big city so that we just - we would visit for culture. But I never had heard of Kensington until - I mean, I must have been well into my 20s when Kensington was - it was known as the hotspot for the opioid epidemic. SHAPIRO: Right. SEYFRIED: And I think, like most people, I only understood it for one thing. And that's part of the reason why I think Liz Moore's book, \"Long Bright River,\" did so well is because she wrote about an honest account and a new perspective on a community that is so marginalized and so feared and avoided because of the suffering, the addiction on the streets, the unhoused people, the sex workers, and not as a community that's actually quite resilient and a community of people who protect each other and kind of move like a well-oiled machine in some ways because they do look after each other. And so... SHAPIRO: Yeah. SEYFRIED: ...I think it was just - opened people's eyes to all these neighborhoods that we don't want to set foot in. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"LONG BRIGHT RIVER\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) How could somebody choose to live like that? SEYFRIED: (As Mickey) Like what? UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) This neighborhood used to be normal, man. We used to play baseball here with our kids. Sure, it was rough and tumble, but nothing like this. SEYFRIED: (As Mickey) Yeah, well, it's got its good parts, its bad parts, like any neighborhood. SHAPIRO: You know, your character is often the only woman in a room full of men, and the same could be said of Elizabeth Holmes, who you played a few years ago. Is there something that you especially connect with in that kind of a role? SEYFRIED: I think I'm always trying to evolve quickly through the people I play because I'm very well aware of the fact that I'm a people pleaser to a fault, and it gets in the way of my priorities. And it can make people in my life who are a priority feel less like a priority because I'm so anxious and aware of what I perceive as comfort for other people. And these two women, specifically Mickey, who's based on so many real people, and Elizabeth Holmes, who is a real person, they didn't waste their time trying to make other people comfortable. They just did what they needed to do when they needed to do it. And the more I play these people, the more aware I am of my failings, and I give myself grace, too. SHAPIRO: But it's so interesting to me to hear that these two characters, who are struggling with so many problems and have so much adversity and have so many challenges, are people who you, Amanda Seyfried, look up to in a way and...

Of course, we all have our opinions about Elizabeth Holmes. But she's a human being, and she's not all bad. She's a three-dimensional person, and we create stories to do that, to create some kind of space for these people to exist as three-dimensional people. And even though we're trying to enhance the situation for television, the point is to still get to know this person in a different way. SHAPIRO: So from where I sit, it looks to me like you have passed the point in your career where people say with surprise, wow, she can really do anything. Now, it's more like, yeah, we know she can do drama and comedy and musicals, and she's good at all of it. And so now that you have cleared that hurdle - or maybe you don't feel like you've cleared that hurdle, I'm not sure. But you've played the cop. You've checked that box. Like, if all of these paths are open to you, which paths look the most appealing next? SEYFRIED: The ones that couldn't be more different than the last character. But I do feel the respect in my industry, and it's wonderful. I don't feel like I have anything to prove. I didn't take on roles in my 30s to prove anything, but in my 20s, that's all I did. SHAPIRO: (Laughter) Yeah. SEYFRIED: So I feel like it's been a good, you know, almost 10 years where I've had more fun and had - some years, I would have more opportunities than others, depending on, you know, what hits and what doesn't. It's all a crapshoot. But I always stayed true to why I made these choices. You know when something's unique. SHAPIRO: Yeah. SEYFRIED: And I don't need to prove anything. I just want to do something different. I just don't want to be bored. SHAPIRO: Well, Amanda Seyfried, it has been such a pleasure talking to you today. SEYFRIED: Thanks. SHAPIRO: Thank you very much. SEYFRIED: Thank you. You're so gentle, and I love your voice. And I love this show. SHAPIRO: Oh, thank you. SEYFRIED: So thanks for everything. SHAPIRO: Well, the feeling is mutual.

SEYFRIED: Yeah. SHAPIRO: ...Given the number of major projects you've done, I'm a little embarrassed that it's taken us this long to have you on the show. SEYFRIED: No, I'm - no, it's - listen, everything in its right time. SHAPIRO: You were building up your whole career for this - this moment. SEYFRIED: Yes. SHAPIRO: (Laughter). SEYFRIED: Yes. Exactly. SHAPIRO: You're an executive producer as well as a star of this show. Why did you want to take it on? SEYFRIED: I wanted to be a cop. SHAPIRO: (Laughter) Really? SEYFRIED: Yep. I wanted to put that belt on. I wanted to put the uniform on. I wanted to portray a cop. This - like, my whole career... SHAPIRO: Lifelong dream, or woke up... SEYFRIED: Yeah. SHAPIRO: ...One morning recently and decided? Like... SEYFRIED: I think it's been a lifelong dream. And it was one of those really impossible goals for me because I was the ingenue for a long time, and I just never saw myself as someone who could even pretend to have authority. So once I started playing roles - like, I played a lawyer once - it almost felt like a joke. You know, it almost felt like if I couldn't believe it, how is anyone else going to believe it? And this was finally a point in my career in which I felt that I was ready to tackle this - my own internal struggle - with authority and how I feel about myself. So I was like, this is a cop who's my age, has a kid and lives in a place that - very close to where I grew up, so it felt... SHAPIRO: Yeah. SEYFRIED: ...Kind of natural. SHAPIRO: It's set in this rough Philadelphia neighborhood of Kensington, where your character grew up, and you grew up just over an hour's drive away from there, in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Did you have a sense of what this place was like before you started working on the project? SEYFRIED: I knew Philly. I know Philly quite well. I know certain parts of Philly. It was a cultural hot spot for me. And having grown up - like, that was the closest big city so that we just - we would visit for culture. But I never had heard of Kensington until - I mean, I must have been well into my 20s when Kensington was - it was known as the hotspot for the opioid epidemic. SHAPIRO: Right. SEYFRIED: And I think, like most people, I only understood it for one thing. And that's part of the reason why I think Liz Moore's book, \"Long Bright River,\" did so well is because she wrote about an honest account and a new perspective on a community that is so marginalized and so feared and avoided because of the suffering, the addiction on the streets, the unhoused people, the sex workers, and not as a community that's actually quite resilient and a community of people who protect each other and kind of move like a well-oiled machine in some ways because they do look after each other. And so... SHAPIRO: Yeah. SEYFRIED: ...I think it was just - opened people's eyes to all these neighborhoods that we don't want to set foot in. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"LONG BRIGHT RIVER\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) How could somebody choose to live like that? SEYFRIED: (As Mickey) Like what? UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) This neighborhood used to be normal, man. We used to play baseball here with our kids. Sure, it was rough and tumble, but nothing like this. SEYFRIED: (As Mickey) Yeah, well, it's got its good parts, its bad parts, like any neighborhood. SHAPIRO: You know, your character is often the only woman in a room full of men, and the same could be said of Elizabeth Holmes, who you played a few years ago. Is there something that you especially connect with in that kind of a role? SEYFRIED: I think I'm always trying to evolve quickly through the people I play because I'm very well aware of the fact that I'm a people pleaser to a fault, and it gets in the way of my priorities. And it can make people in my life who are a priority feel less like a priority because I'm so anxious and aware of what I perceive as comfort for other people. And these two women, specifically Mickey, who's based on so many real people, and Elizabeth Holmes, who is a real person, they didn't waste their time trying to make other people comfortable. They just did what they needed to do when they needed to do it. And the more I play these people, the more aware I am of my failings, and I give myself grace, too. SHAPIRO: But it's so interesting to me to hear that these two characters, who are struggling with so many problems and have so much adversity and have so many challenges, are people who you, Amanda Seyfried, look up to in a way and... SEYFRIED: Absolutely. SHAPIRO: ...Aspire to be more like in a way.

And so now that you have cleared that hurdle - or maybe you don't feel like you've cleared that hurdle, I'm not sure. But you've played the cop. You've checked that box. Like, if all of these paths are open to you, which paths look the most appealing next? SEYFRIED: The ones that couldn't be more different than the last character. But I do feel the respect in my industry, and it's wonderful. I don't feel like I have anything to prove. I didn't take on roles in my 30s to prove anything, but in my 20s, that's all I did. SHAPIRO: (Laughter) Yeah. SEYFRIED: So I feel like it's been a good, you know, almost 10 years where I've had more fun and had - some years, I would have more opportunities than others, depending on, you know, what hits and what doesn't. It's all a crapshoot. But I always stayed true to why I made these choices. You know when something's unique. SHAPIRO: Yeah. SEYFRIED: And I don't need to prove anything. I just want to do something different. I just don't want to be bored. SHAPIRO: Well, Amanda Seyfried, it has been such a pleasure talking to you today. SEYFRIED: Thanks. SHAPIRO: Thank you very much. SEYFRIED: Thank you. You're so gentle, and I love your voice. And I love this show. SHAPIRO: Oh, thank you. SEYFRIED: So thanks for everything. SHAPIRO: Well, the feeling is mutual.

SHAPIRO: ...Given the number of major projects you've done, I'm a little embarrassed that it's taken us this long to have you on the show. SEYFRIED: No, I'm - no, it's - listen, everything in its right time. SHAPIRO: You were building up your whole career for this - this moment. SEYFRIED: Yes. SHAPIRO: (Laughter). SEYFRIED: Yes. Exactly. SHAPIRO: You're an executive producer as well as a star of this show. Why did you want to take it on? SEYFRIED: I wanted to be a cop. SHAPIRO: (Laughter) Really? SEYFRIED: Yep. I wanted to put that belt on. I wanted to put the uniform on. I wanted to portray a cop. This - like, my whole career... SHAPIRO: Lifelong dream, or woke up... SEYFRIED: Yeah. SHAPIRO: ...One morning recently and decided? Like... SEYFRIED: I think it's been a lifelong dream. And it was one of those really impossible goals for me because I was the ingenue for a long time, and I just never saw myself as someone who could even pretend to have authority. So once I started playing roles - like, I played a lawyer once - it almost felt like a joke. You know, it almost felt like if I couldn't believe it, how is anyone else going to believe it? And this was finally a point in my career in which I felt that I was ready to tackle this - my own internal struggle - with authority and how I feel about myself. So I was like, this is a cop who's my age, has a kid and lives in a place that - very close to where I grew up, so it felt... SHAPIRO: Yeah. SEYFRIED: ...Kind of natural. SHAPIRO: It's set in this rough Philadelphia neighborhood of Kensington, where your character grew up, and you grew up just over an hour's drive away from there, in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Did you have a sense of what this place was like before you started working on the project? SEYFRIED: I knew Philly. I know Philly quite well. I know certain parts of Philly. It was a cultural hot spot for me. And having grown up - like, that was the closest big city so that we just - we would visit for culture. But I never had heard of Kensington until - I mean, I must have been well into my 20s when Kensington was - it was known as the hotspot for the opioid epidemic. SHAPIRO: Right. SEYFRIED: And I think, like most people, I only understood it for one thing. And that's part of the reason why I think Liz Moore's book, \"Long Bright River,\" did so well is because she wrote about an honest account and a new perspective on a community that is so marginalized and so feared and avoided because of the suffering, the addiction on the streets, the unhoused people, the sex workers, and not as a community that's actually quite resilient and a community of people who protect each other and kind of move like a well-oiled machine in some ways because they do look after each other. And so... SHAPIRO: Yeah. SEYFRIED: ...I think it was just - opened people's eyes to all these neighborhoods that we don't want to set foot in. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"LONG BRIGHT RIVER\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) How could somebody choose to live like that? SEYFRIED: (As Mickey) Like what? UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) This neighborhood used to be normal, man. We used to play baseball here with our kids. Sure, it was rough and tumble, but nothing like this. SEYFRIED: (As Mickey) Yeah, well, it's got its good parts, its bad parts, like any neighborhood. SHAPIRO: You know, your character is often the only woman in a room full of men, and the same could be said of Elizabeth Holmes, who you played a few years ago. Is there something that you especially connect with in that kind of a role? SEYFRIED: I think I'm always trying to evolve quickly through the people I play because I'm very well aware of the fact that I'm a people pleaser to a fault, and it gets in the way of my priorities. And it can make people in my life who are a priority feel less like a priority because I'm so anxious and aware of what I perceive as comfort for other people. And these two women, specifically Mickey, who's based on so many real people, and Elizabeth Holmes, who is a real person, they didn't waste their time trying to make other people comfortable. They just did what they needed to do when they needed to do it. And the more I play these people, the more aware I am of my failings, and I give myself grace, too. SHAPIRO: But it's so interesting to me to hear that these two characters, who are struggling with so many problems and have so much adversity and have so many challenges, are people who you, Amanda Seyfried, look up to in a way and... SEYFRIED: Absolutely. SHAPIRO: ...Aspire to be more like in a way. SEYFRIED: Well, also, when you're acting, when you're portraying somebody, a way to honor the work at hand and to make it really count is to empathize as much as humanly possible. Of course, we all have our opinions about Elizabeth Holmes. But she's a human being, and she's not all bad. She's a three-dimensional person, and we create stories to do that, to create some kind of space for these people to exist as three-dimensional people. And even though we're trying to enhance the situation for television, the point is to still get to know this person in a different way. SHAPIRO: So from where I sit, it looks to me like you have passed the point in your career where people say with surprise, wow, she can really do anything. Now, it's more like, yeah, we know she can do drama and comedy and musicals, and she's good at all of it.

I just want to do something different. I just don't want to be bored. SHAPIRO: Well, Amanda Seyfried, it has been such a pleasure talking to you today. SEYFRIED: Thanks. SHAPIRO: Thank you very much. SEYFRIED: Thank you. You're so gentle, and I love your voice. And I love this show. SHAPIRO: Oh, thank you. SEYFRIED: So thanks for everything. SHAPIRO: Well, the feeling is mutual.

SEYFRIED: No, I'm - no, it's - listen, everything in its right time. SHAPIRO: You were building up your whole career for this - this moment. SEYFRIED: Yes. SHAPIRO: (Laughter). SEYFRIED: Yes. Exactly. SHAPIRO: You're an executive producer as well as a star of this show. Why did you want to take it on? SEYFRIED: I wanted to be a cop. SHAPIRO: (Laughter) Really? SEYFRIED: Yep. I wanted to put that belt on. I wanted to put the uniform on. I wanted to portray a cop. This - like, my whole career... SHAPIRO: Lifelong dream, or woke up... SEYFRIED: Yeah. SHAPIRO: ...One morning recently and decided? Like... SEYFRIED: I think it's been a lifelong dream. And it was one of those really impossible goals for me because I was the ingenue for a long time, and I just never saw myself as someone who could even pretend to have authority. So once I started playing roles - like, I played a lawyer once - it almost felt like a joke. You know, it almost felt like if I couldn't believe it, how is anyone else going to believe it? And this was finally a point in my career in which I felt that I was ready to tackle this - my own internal struggle - with authority and how I feel about myself. So I was like, this is a cop who's my age, has a kid and lives in a place that - very close to where I grew up, so it felt... SHAPIRO: Yeah. SEYFRIED: ...Kind of natural. SHAPIRO: It's set in this rough Philadelphia neighborhood of Kensington, where your character grew up, and you grew up just over an hour's drive away from there, in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Did you have a sense of what this place was like before you started working on the project? SEYFRIED: I knew Philly. I know Philly quite well. I know certain parts of Philly. It was a cultural hot spot for me. And having grown up - like, that was the closest big city so that we just - we would visit for culture. But I never had heard of Kensington until - I mean, I must have been well into my 20s when Kensington was - it was known as the hotspot for the opioid epidemic. SHAPIRO: Right. SEYFRIED: And I think, like most people, I only understood it for one thing. And that's part of the reason why I think Liz Moore's book, \"Long Bright River,\" did so well is because she wrote about an honest account and a new perspective on a community that is so marginalized and so feared and avoided because of the suffering, the addiction on the streets, the unhoused people, the sex workers, and not as a community that's actually quite resilient and a community of people who protect each other and kind of move like a well-oiled machine in some ways because they do look after each other. And so... SHAPIRO: Yeah. SEYFRIED: ...I think it was just - opened people's eyes to all these neighborhoods that we don't want to set foot in. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"LONG BRIGHT RIVER\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) How could somebody choose to live like that? SEYFRIED: (As Mickey) Like what? UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) This neighborhood used to be normal, man. We used to play baseball here with our kids. Sure, it was rough and tumble, but nothing like this. SEYFRIED: (As Mickey) Yeah, well, it's got its good parts, its bad parts, like any neighborhood. SHAPIRO: You know, your character is often the only woman in a room full of men, and the same could be said of Elizabeth Holmes, who you played a few years ago. Is there something that you especially connect with in that kind of a role? SEYFRIED: I think I'm always trying to evolve quickly through the people I play because I'm very well aware of the fact that I'm a people pleaser to a fault, and it gets in the way of my priorities. And it can make people in my life who are a priority feel less like a priority because I'm so anxious and aware of what I perceive as comfort for other people. And these two women, specifically Mickey, who's based on so many real people, and Elizabeth Holmes, who is a real person, they didn't waste their time trying to make other people comfortable. They just did what they needed to do when they needed to do it. And the more I play these people, the more aware I am of my failings, and I give myself grace, too. SHAPIRO: But it's so interesting to me to hear that these two characters, who are struggling with so many problems and have so much adversity and have so many challenges, are people who you, Amanda Seyfried, look up to in a way and... SEYFRIED: Absolutely. SHAPIRO: ...Aspire to be more like in a way. SEYFRIED: Well, also, when you're acting, when you're portraying somebody, a way to honor the work at hand and to make it really count is to empathize as much as humanly possible. Of course, we all have our opinions about Elizabeth Holmes. But she's a human being, and she's not all bad. She's a three-dimensional person, and we create stories to do that, to create some kind of space for these people to exist as three-dimensional people. And even though we're trying to enhance the situation for television, the point is to still get to know this person in a different way. SHAPIRO: So from where I sit, it looks to me like you have passed the point in your career where people say with surprise, wow, she can really do anything. Now, it's more like, yeah, we know she can do drama and comedy and musicals, and she's good at all of it. And so now that you have cleared that hurdle - or maybe you don't feel like you've cleared that hurdle, I'm not sure. But you've played the cop. You've checked that box. Like, if all of these paths are open to you, which paths look the most appealing next? SEYFRIED: The ones that couldn't be more different than the last character. But I do feel the respect in my industry, and it's wonderful. I don't feel like I have anything to prove. I didn't take on roles in my 30s to prove anything, but in my 20s, that's all I did. SHAPIRO: (Laughter) Yeah. SEYFRIED: So I feel like it's been a good, you know, almost 10 years where I've had more fun and had - some years, I would have more opportunities than others, depending on, you know, what hits and what doesn't.

SHAPIRO: ...One morning recently and decided? Like... SEYFRIED: I think it's been a lifelong dream. And it was one of those really impossible goals for me because I was the ingenue for a long time, and I just never saw myself as someone who could even pretend to have authority. So once I started playing roles - like, I played a lawyer once - it almost felt like a joke. You know, it almost felt like if I couldn't believe it, how is anyone else going to believe it? And this was finally a point in my career in which I felt that I was ready to tackle this - my own internal struggle - with authority and how I feel about myself. So I was like, this is a cop who's my age, has a kid and lives in a place that - very close to where I grew up, so it felt... SHAPIRO: Yeah. SEYFRIED: ...Kind of natural. SHAPIRO: It's set in this rough Philadelphia neighborhood of Kensington, where your character grew up, and you grew up just over an hour's drive away from there, in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Did you have a sense of what this place was like before you started working on the project? SEYFRIED: I knew Philly. I know Philly quite well. I know certain parts of Philly. It was a cultural hot spot for me. And having grown up - like, that was the closest big city so that we just - we would visit for culture. But I never had heard of Kensington until - I mean, I must have been well into my 20s when Kensington was - it was known as the hotspot for the opioid epidemic. SHAPIRO: Right. SEYFRIED: And I think, like most people, I only understood it for one thing. And that's part of the reason why I think Liz Moore's book, \"Long Bright River,\" did so well is because she wrote about an honest account and a new perspective on a community that is so marginalized and so feared and avoided because of the suffering, the addiction on the streets, the unhoused people, the sex workers, and not as a community that's actually quite resilient and a community of people who protect each other and kind of move like a well-oiled machine in some ways because they do look after each other. And so... SHAPIRO: Yeah. SEYFRIED: ...I think it was just - opened people's eyes to all these neighborhoods that we don't want to set foot in. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"LONG BRIGHT RIVER\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) How could somebody choose to live like that? SEYFRIED: (As Mickey) Like what? UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) This neighborhood used to be normal, man. We used to play baseball here with our kids. Sure, it was rough and tumble, but nothing like this. SEYFRIED: (As Mickey) Yeah, well, it's got its good parts, its bad parts, like any neighborhood. SHAPIRO: You know, your character is often the only woman in a room full of men, and the same could be said of Elizabeth Holmes, who you played a few years ago. Is there something that you especially connect with in that kind of a role? SEYFRIED: I think I'm always trying to evolve quickly through the people I play because I'm very well aware of the fact that I'm a people pleaser to a fault, and it gets in the way of my priorities. And it can make people in my life who are a priority feel less like a priority because I'm so anxious and aware of what I perceive as comfort for other people. And these two women, specifically Mickey, who's based on so many real people, and Elizabeth Holmes, who is a real person, they didn't waste their time trying to make other people comfortable. They just did what they needed to do when they needed to do it. And the more I play these people, the more aware I am of my failings, and I give myself grace, too. SHAPIRO: But it's so interesting to me to hear that these two characters, who are struggling with so many problems and have so much adversity and have so many challenges, are people who you, Amanda Seyfried, look up to in a way and... SEYFRIED: Absolutely. SHAPIRO: ...Aspire to be more like in a way. SEYFRIED: Well, also, when you're acting, when you're portraying somebody, a way to honor the work at hand and to make it really count is to empathize as much as humanly possible. Of course, we all have our opinions about Elizabeth Holmes. But she's a human being, and she's not all bad. She's a three-dimensional person, and we create stories to do that, to create some kind of space for these people to exist as three-dimensional people. And even though we're trying to enhance the situation for television, the point is to still get to know this person in a different way. SHAPIRO: So from where I sit, it looks to me like you have passed the point in your career where people say with surprise, wow, she can really do anything. Now, it's more like, yeah, we know she can do drama and comedy and musicals, and she's good at all of it. And so now that you have cleared that hurdle - or maybe you don't feel like you've cleared that hurdle, I'm not sure. But you've played the cop. You've checked that box. Like, if all of these paths are open to you, which paths look the most appealing next? SEYFRIED: The ones that couldn't be more different than the last character. But I do feel the respect in my industry, and it's wonderful. I don't feel like I have anything to prove. I didn't take on roles in my 30s to prove anything, but in my 20s, that's all I did. SHAPIRO: (Laughter) Yeah. SEYFRIED: So I feel like it's been a good, you know, almost 10 years where I've had more fun and had - some years, I would have more opportunities than others, depending on, you know, what hits and what doesn't. It's all a crapshoot. But I always stayed true to why I made these choices. You know when something's unique. SHAPIRO: Yeah. SEYFRIED: And I don't need to prove anything. I just want to do something different. I just don't want to be bored. SHAPIRO: Well, Amanda Seyfried, it has been such a pleasure talking to you today. SEYFRIED: Thanks. SHAPIRO: Thank you very much. SEYFRIED: Thank you. You're so gentle, and I love your voice. And I love this show. SHAPIRO: Oh, thank you. SEYFRIED: So thanks for everything. SHAPIRO: Well, the feeling is mutual. She's executive producer and star of the new eight-part series \"Long Bright River\" on Peacock. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

SEYFRIED: (As Mickey) Yeah, well, it's got its good parts, its bad parts, like any neighborhood. SHAPIRO: You know, your character is often the only woman in a room full of men, and the same could be said of Elizabeth Holmes, who you played a few years ago. Is there something that you especially connect with in that kind of a role? SEYFRIED: I think I'm always trying to evolve quickly through the people I play because I'm very well aware of the fact that I'm a people pleaser to a fault, and it gets in the way of my priorities. And it can make people in my life who are a priority feel less like a priority because I'm so anxious and aware of what I perceive as comfort for other people. And these two women, specifically Mickey, who's based on so many real people, and Elizabeth Holmes, who is a real person, they didn't waste their time trying to make other people comfortable. They just did what they needed to do when they needed to do it. And the more I play these people, the more aware I am of my failings, and I give myself grace, too. SHAPIRO: But it's so interesting to me to hear that these two characters, who are struggling with so many problems and have so much adversity and have so many challenges, are people who you, Amanda Seyfried, look up to in a way and... SEYFRIED: Absolutely. SHAPIRO: ...Aspire to be more like in a way. SEYFRIED: Well, also, when you're acting, when you're portraying somebody, a way to honor the work at hand and to make it really count is to empathize as much as humanly possible. Of course, we all have our opinions about Elizabeth Holmes. But she's a human being, and she's not all bad. She's a three-dimensional person, and we create stories to do that, to create some kind of space for these people to exist as three-dimensional people. And even though we're trying to enhance the situation for television, the point is to still get to know this person in a different way. SHAPIRO: So from where I sit, it looks to me like you have passed the point in your career where people say with surprise, wow, she can really do anything. Now, it's more like, yeah, we know she can do drama and comedy and musicals, and she's good at all of it. And so now that you have cleared that hurdle - or maybe you don't feel like you've cleared that hurdle, I'm not sure. But you've played the cop. You've checked that box. Like, if all of these paths are open to you, which paths look the most appealing next? SEYFRIED: The ones that couldn't be more different than the last character. But I do feel the respect in my industry, and it's wonderful. I don't feel like I have anything to prove. I didn't take on roles in my 30s to prove anything, but in my 20s, that's all I did. SHAPIRO: (Laughter) Yeah. SEYFRIED: So I feel like it's been a good, you know, almost 10 years where I've had more fun and had - some years, I would have more opportunities than others, depending on, you know, what hits and what doesn't. It's all a crapshoot. But I always stayed true to why I made these choices. You know when something's unique. SHAPIRO: Yeah. SEYFRIED: And I don't need to prove anything. I just want to do something different. I just don't want to be bored. SHAPIRO: Well, Amanda Seyfried, it has been such a pleasure talking to you today. SEYFRIED: Thanks. SHAPIRO: Thank you very much. SEYFRIED: Thank you. You're so gentle, and I love your voice. And I love this show. SHAPIRO: Oh, thank you. SEYFRIED: So thanks for everything. SHAPIRO: Well, the feeling is mutual. She's executive producer and star of the new eight-part series \"Long Bright River\" on Peacock. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Why did you want to take it on? SEYFRIED: I wanted to be a cop. SHAPIRO: (Laughter) Really? SEYFRIED: Yep. I wanted to put that belt on. I wanted to put the uniform on. I wanted to portray a cop. This - like, my whole career... SHAPIRO: Lifelong dream, or woke up... SEYFRIED: Yeah. SHAPIRO: ...One morning recently and decided? Like... SEYFRIED: I think it's been a lifelong dream. And it was one of those really impossible goals for me because I was the ingenue for a long time, and I just never saw myself as someone who could even pretend to have authority. So once I started playing roles - like, I played a lawyer once - it almost felt like a joke. You know, it almost felt like if I couldn't believe it, how is anyone else going to believe it? And this was finally a point in my career in which I felt that I was ready to tackle this - my own internal struggle - with authority and how I feel about myself. So I was like, this is a cop who's my age, has a kid and lives in a place that - very close to where I grew up, so it felt... SHAPIRO: Yeah. SEYFRIED: ...Kind of natural. SHAPIRO: It's set in this rough Philadelphia neighborhood of Kensington, where your character grew up, and you grew up just over an hour's drive away from there, in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Did you have a sense of what this place was like before you started working on the project? SEYFRIED: I knew Philly. I know Philly quite well. I know certain parts of Philly. It was a cultural hot spot for me. And having grown up - like, that was the closest big city so that we just - we would visit for culture. But I never had heard of Kensington until - I mean, I must have been well into my 20s when Kensington was - it was known as the hotspot for the opioid epidemic. SHAPIRO: Right. SEYFRIED: And I think, like most people, I only understood it for one thing. And that's part of the reason why I think Liz Moore's book, \"Long Bright River,\" did so well is because she wrote about an honest account and a new perspective on a community that is so marginalized and so feared and avoided because of the suffering, the addiction on the streets, the unhoused people, the sex workers, and not as a community that's actually quite resilient and a community of people who protect each other and kind of move like a well-oiled machine in some ways because they do look after each other. And so... SHAPIRO: Yeah. SEYFRIED: ...I think it was just - opened people's eyes to all these neighborhoods that we don't want to set foot in.

SEYFRIED: So I feel like it's been a good, you know, almost 10 years where I've had more fun and had - some years, I would have more opportunities than others, depending on, you know, what hits and what doesn't. It's all a crapshoot. But I always stayed true to why I made these choices. You know when something's unique. SHAPIRO: Yeah. SEYFRIED: And I don't need to prove anything. I just want to do something different. I just don't want to be bored. SHAPIRO: Well, Amanda Seyfried, it has been such a pleasure talking to you today. SEYFRIED: Thanks. SHAPIRO: Thank you very much. SEYFRIED: Thank you. You're so gentle, and I love your voice. And I love this show. SHAPIRO: Oh, thank you. SEYFRIED: So thanks for everything. SHAPIRO: Well, the feeling is mutual.

SEYFRIED: I wanted to be a cop. SHAPIRO: (Laughter) Really? SEYFRIED: Yep. I wanted to put that belt on. I wanted to put the uniform on. I wanted to portray a cop. This - like, my whole career... SHAPIRO: Lifelong dream, or woke up... SEYFRIED: Yeah. SHAPIRO: ...One morning recently and decided? Like... SEYFRIED: I think it's been a lifelong dream. And it was one of those really impossible goals for me because I was the ingenue for a long time, and I just never saw myself as someone who could even pretend to have authority. So once I started playing roles - like, I played a lawyer once - it almost felt like a joke. You know, it almost felt like if I couldn't believe it, how is anyone else going to believe it? And this was finally a point in my career in which I felt that I was ready to tackle this - my own internal struggle - with authority and how I feel about myself. So I was like, this is a cop who's my age, has a kid and lives in a place that - very close to where I grew up, so it felt... SHAPIRO: Yeah. SEYFRIED: ...Kind of natural. SHAPIRO: It's set in this rough Philadelphia neighborhood of Kensington, where your character grew up, and you grew up just over an hour's drive away from there, in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Did you have a sense of what this place was like before you started working on the project? SEYFRIED: I knew Philly. I know Philly quite well. I know certain parts of Philly. It was a cultural hot spot for me. And having grown up - like, that was the closest big city so that we just - we would visit for culture. But I never had heard of Kensington until - I mean, I must have been well into my 20s when Kensington was - it was known as the hotspot for the opioid epidemic. SHAPIRO: Right. SEYFRIED: And I think, like most people, I only understood it for one thing. And that's part of the reason why I think Liz Moore's book, \"Long Bright River,\" did so well is because she wrote about an honest account and a new perspective on a community that is so marginalized and so feared and avoided because of the suffering, the addiction on the streets, the unhoused people, the sex workers, and not as a community that's actually quite resilient and a community of people who protect each other and kind of move like a well-oiled machine in some ways because they do look after each other. And so... SHAPIRO: Yeah. SEYFRIED: ...I think it was just - opened people's eyes to all these neighborhoods that we don't want to set foot in. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"LONG BRIGHT RIVER\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) How could somebody choose to live like that? SEYFRIED: (As Mickey) Like what? UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) This neighborhood used to be normal, man. We used to play baseball here with our kids. Sure, it was rough and tumble, but nothing like this. SEYFRIED: (As Mickey) Yeah, well, it's got its good parts, its bad parts, like any neighborhood. SHAPIRO: You know, your character is often the only woman in a room full of men, and the same could be said of Elizabeth Holmes, who you played a few years ago. Is there something that you especially connect with in that kind of a role? SEYFRIED: I think I'm always trying to evolve quickly through the people I play because I'm very well aware of the fact that I'm a people pleaser to a fault, and it gets in the way of my priorities. And it can make people in my life who are a priority feel less like a priority because I'm so anxious and aware of what I perceive as comfort for other people. And these two women, specifically Mickey, who's based on so many real people, and Elizabeth Holmes, who is a real person, they didn't waste their time trying to make other people comfortable. They just did what they needed to do when they needed to do it. And the more I play these people, the more aware I am of my failings, and I give myself grace, too. SHAPIRO: But it's so interesting to me to hear that these two characters, who are struggling with so many problems and have so much adversity and have so many challenges, are people who you, Amanda Seyfried, look up to in a way and... SEYFRIED: Absolutely. SHAPIRO: ...Aspire to be more like in a way. SEYFRIED: Well, also, when you're acting, when you're portraying somebody, a way to honor the work at hand and to make it really count is to empathize as much as humanly possible. Of course, we all have our opinions about Elizabeth Holmes. But she's a human being, and she's not all bad. She's a three-dimensional person, and we create stories to do that, to create some kind of space for these people to exist as three-dimensional people. And even though we're trying to enhance the situation for television, the point is to still get to know this person in a different way. SHAPIRO: So from where I sit, it looks to me like you have passed the point in your career where people say with surprise, wow, she can really do anything. Now, it's more like, yeah, we know she can do drama and comedy and musicals, and she's good at all of it. And so now that you have cleared that hurdle - or maybe you don't feel like you've cleared that hurdle, I'm not sure. But you've played the cop. You've checked that box. Like, if all of these paths are open to you, which paths look the most appealing next? SEYFRIED: The ones that couldn't be more different than the last character. But I do feel the respect in my industry, and it's wonderful. I don't feel like I have anything to prove. I didn't take on roles in my 30s to prove anything, but in my 20s, that's all I did. SHAPIRO: (Laughter) Yeah. SEYFRIED: So I feel like it's been a good, you know, almost 10 years where I've had more fun and had - some years, I would have more opportunities than others, depending on, you know, what hits and what doesn't.

And that's part of the reason why I think Liz Moore's book, \"Long Bright River,\" did so well is because she wrote about an honest account and a new perspective on a community that is so marginalized and so feared and avoided because of the suffering, the addiction on the streets, the unhoused people, the sex workers, and not as a community that's actually quite resilient and a community of people who protect each other and kind of move like a well-oiled machine in some ways because they do look after each other. And so... SHAPIRO: Yeah. SEYFRIED: ...I think it was just - opened people's eyes to all these neighborhoods that we don't want to set foot in. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"LONG BRIGHT RIVER\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) How could somebody choose to live like that? SEYFRIED: (As Mickey) Like what? UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) This neighborhood used to be normal, man. We used to play baseball here with our kids. Sure, it was rough and tumble, but nothing like this. SEYFRIED: (As Mickey) Yeah, well, it's got its good parts, its bad parts, like any neighborhood. SHAPIRO: You know, your character is often the only woman in a room full of men, and the same could be said of Elizabeth Holmes, who you played a few years ago. Is there something that you especially connect with in that kind of a role? SEYFRIED: I think I'm always trying to evolve quickly through the people I play because I'm very well aware of the fact that I'm a people pleaser to a fault, and it gets in the way of my priorities. And it can make people in my life who are a priority feel less like a priority because I'm so anxious and aware of what I perceive as comfort for other people. And these two women, specifically Mickey, who's based on so many real people, and Elizabeth Holmes, who is a real person, they didn't waste their time trying to make other people comfortable. They just did what they needed to do when they needed to do it. And the more I play these people, the more aware I am of my failings, and I give myself grace, too. SHAPIRO: But it's so interesting to me to hear that these two characters, who are struggling with so many problems and have so much adversity and have so many challenges, are people who you, Amanda Seyfried, look up to in a way and... SEYFRIED: Absolutely. SHAPIRO: ...Aspire to be more like in a way. SEYFRIED: Well, also, when you're acting, when you're portraying somebody, a way to honor the work at hand and to make it really count is to empathize as much as humanly possible. Of course, we all have our opinions about Elizabeth Holmes. But she's a human being, and she's not all bad. She's a three-dimensional person, and we create stories to do that, to create some kind of space for these people to exist as three-dimensional people. And even though we're trying to enhance the situation for television, the point is to still get to know this person in a different way. SHAPIRO: So from where I sit, it looks to me like you have passed the point in your career where people say with surprise, wow, she can really do anything. Now, it's more like, yeah, we know she can do drama and comedy and musicals, and she's good at all of it. And so now that you have cleared that hurdle - or maybe you don't feel like you've cleared that hurdle, I'm not sure. But you've played the cop. You've checked that box. Like, if all of these paths are open to you, which paths look the most appealing next? SEYFRIED: The ones that couldn't be more different than the last character. But I do feel the respect in my industry, and it's wonderful. I don't feel like I have anything to prove. I didn't take on roles in my 30s to prove anything, but in my 20s, that's all I did. SHAPIRO: (Laughter) Yeah. SEYFRIED: So I feel like it's been a good, you know, almost 10 years where I've had more fun and had - some years, I would have more opportunities than others, depending on, you know, what hits and what doesn't. It's all a crapshoot. But I always stayed true to why I made these choices. You know when something's unique. SHAPIRO: Yeah. SEYFRIED: And I don't need to prove anything. I just want to do something different. I just don't want to be bored. SHAPIRO: Well, Amanda Seyfried, it has been such a pleasure talking to you today. SEYFRIED: Thanks. SHAPIRO: Thank you very much. SEYFRIED: Thank you. You're so gentle, and I love your voice. And I love this show. SHAPIRO: Oh, thank you. SEYFRIED: So thanks for everything. SHAPIRO: Well, the feeling is mutual. She's executive producer and star of the new eight-part series \"Long Bright River\" on Peacock. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

This - like, my whole career... SHAPIRO: Lifelong dream, or woke up... SEYFRIED: Yeah. SHAPIRO: ...One morning recently and decided? Like... SEYFRIED: I think it's been a lifelong dream. And it was one of those really impossible goals for me because I was the ingenue for a long time, and I just never saw myself as someone who could even pretend to have authority. So once I started playing roles - like, I played a lawyer once - it almost felt like a joke. You know, it almost felt like if I couldn't believe it, how is anyone else going to believe it? And this was finally a point in my career in which I felt that I was ready to tackle this - my own internal struggle - with authority and how I feel about myself. So I was like, this is a cop who's my age, has a kid and lives in a place that - very close to where I grew up, so it felt... SHAPIRO: Yeah. SEYFRIED: ...Kind of natural. SHAPIRO: It's set in this rough Philadelphia neighborhood of Kensington, where your character grew up, and you grew up just over an hour's drive away from there, in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Did you have a sense of what this place was like before you started working on the project? SEYFRIED: I knew Philly. I know Philly quite well. I know certain parts of Philly. It was a cultural hot spot for me. And having grown up - like, that was the closest big city so that we just - we would visit for culture. But I never had heard of Kensington until - I mean, I must have been well into my 20s when Kensington was - it was known as the hotspot for the opioid epidemic. SHAPIRO: Right.

It's all a crapshoot. But I always stayed true to why I made these choices. You know when something's unique. SHAPIRO: Yeah. SEYFRIED: And I don't need to prove anything. I just want to do something different. I just don't want to be bored. SHAPIRO: Well, Amanda Seyfried, it has been such a pleasure talking to you today. SEYFRIED: Thanks. SHAPIRO: Thank you very much. SEYFRIED: Thank you. You're so gentle, and I love your voice. And I love this show. SHAPIRO: Oh, thank you. SEYFRIED: So thanks for everything. SHAPIRO: Well, the feeling is mutual.

And it was one of those really impossible goals for me because I was the ingenue for a long time, and I just never saw myself as someone who could even pretend to have authority. So once I started playing roles - like, I played a lawyer once - it almost felt like a joke. You know, it almost felt like if I couldn't believe it, how is anyone else going to believe it? And this was finally a point in my career in which I felt that I was ready to tackle this - my own internal struggle - with authority and how I feel about myself. So I was like, this is a cop who's my age, has a kid and lives in a place that - very close to where I grew up, so it felt... SHAPIRO: Yeah. SEYFRIED: ...Kind of natural. SHAPIRO: It's set in this rough Philadelphia neighborhood of Kensington, where your character grew up, and you grew up just over an hour's drive away from there, in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Did you have a sense of what this place was like before you started working on the project? SEYFRIED: I knew Philly. I know Philly quite well. I know certain parts of Philly. It was a cultural hot spot for me. And having grown up - like, that was the closest big city so that we just - we would visit for culture. But I never had heard of Kensington until - I mean, I must have been well into my 20s when Kensington was - it was known as the hotspot for the opioid epidemic. SHAPIRO: Right. SEYFRIED: And I think, like most people, I only understood it for one thing. And that's part of the reason why I think Liz Moore's book, \"Long Bright River,\" did so well is because she wrote about an honest account and a new perspective on a community that is so marginalized and so feared and avoided because of the suffering, the addiction on the streets, the unhoused people, the sex workers, and not as a community that's actually quite resilient and a community of people who protect each other and kind of move like a well-oiled machine in some ways because they do look after each other. And so... SHAPIRO: Yeah. SEYFRIED: ...I think it was just - opened people's eyes to all these neighborhoods that we don't want to set foot in. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"LONG BRIGHT RIVER\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) How could somebody choose to live like that? SEYFRIED: (As Mickey) Like what? UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) This neighborhood used to be normal, man. We used to play baseball here with our kids. Sure, it was rough and tumble, but nothing like this. SEYFRIED: (As Mickey) Yeah, well, it's got its good parts, its bad parts, like any neighborhood. SHAPIRO: You know, your character is often the only woman in a room full of men, and the same could be said of Elizabeth Holmes, who you played a few years ago. Is there something that you especially connect with in that kind of a role? SEYFRIED: I think I'm always trying to evolve quickly through the people I play because I'm very well aware of the fact that I'm a people pleaser to a fault, and it gets in the way of my priorities. And it can make people in my life who are a priority feel less like a priority because I'm so anxious and aware of what I perceive as comfort for other people. And these two women, specifically Mickey, who's based on so many real people, and Elizabeth Holmes, who is a real person, they didn't waste their time trying to make other people comfortable. They just did what they needed to do when they needed to do it. And the more I play these people, the more aware I am of my failings, and I give myself grace, too. SHAPIRO: But it's so interesting to me to hear that these two characters, who are struggling with so many problems and have so much adversity and have so many challenges, are people who you, Amanda Seyfried, look up to in a way and... SEYFRIED: Absolutely. SHAPIRO: ...Aspire to be more like in a way. SEYFRIED: Well, also, when you're acting, when you're portraying somebody, a way to honor the work at hand and to make it really count is to empathize as much as humanly possible. Of course, we all have our opinions about Elizabeth Holmes. But she's a human being, and she's not all bad. She's a three-dimensional person, and we create stories to do that, to create some kind of space for these people to exist as three-dimensional people. And even though we're trying to enhance the situation for television, the point is to still get to know this person in a different way. SHAPIRO: So from where I sit, it looks to me like you have passed the point in your career where people say with surprise, wow, she can really do anything. Now, it's more like, yeah, we know she can do drama and comedy and musicals, and she's good at all of it. And so now that you have cleared that hurdle - or maybe you don't feel like you've cleared that hurdle, I'm not sure. But you've played the cop. You've checked that box. Like, if all of these paths are open to you, which paths look the most appealing next? SEYFRIED: The ones that couldn't be more different than the last character. But I do feel the respect in my industry, and it's wonderful. I don't feel like I have anything to prove. I didn't take on roles in my 30s to prove anything, but in my 20s, that's all I did. SHAPIRO: (Laughter) Yeah. SEYFRIED: So I feel like it's been a good, you know, almost 10 years where I've had more fun and had - some years, I would have more opportunities than others, depending on, you know, what hits and what doesn't. It's all a crapshoot. But I always stayed true to why I made these choices. You know when something's unique. SHAPIRO: Yeah. SEYFRIED: And I don't need to prove anything.

SHAPIRO: But it's so interesting to me to hear that these two characters, who are struggling with so many problems and have so much adversity and have so many challenges, are people who you, Amanda Seyfried, look up to in a way and... SEYFRIED: Absolutely. SHAPIRO: ...Aspire to be more like in a way. SEYFRIED: Well, also, when you're acting, when you're portraying somebody, a way to honor the work at hand and to make it really count is to empathize as much as humanly possible. Of course, we all have our opinions about Elizabeth Holmes. But she's a human being, and she's not all bad. She's a three-dimensional person, and we create stories to do that, to create some kind of space for these people to exist as three-dimensional people. And even though we're trying to enhance the situation for television, the point is to still get to know this person in a different way. SHAPIRO: So from where I sit, it looks to me like you have passed the point in your career where people say with surprise, wow, she can really do anything. Now, it's more like, yeah, we know she can do drama and comedy and musicals, and she's good at all of it. And so now that you have cleared that hurdle - or maybe you don't feel like you've cleared that hurdle, I'm not sure. But you've played the cop. You've checked that box. Like, if all of these paths are open to you, which paths look the most appealing next? SEYFRIED: The ones that couldn't be more different than the last character. But I do feel the respect in my industry, and it's wonderful. I don't feel like I have anything to prove. I didn't take on roles in my 30s to prove anything, but in my 20s, that's all I did. SHAPIRO: (Laughter) Yeah. SEYFRIED: So I feel like it's been a good, you know, almost 10 years where I've had more fun and had - some years, I would have more opportunities than others, depending on, you know, what hits and what doesn't. It's all a crapshoot. But I always stayed true to why I made these choices. You know when something's unique. SHAPIRO: Yeah. SEYFRIED: And I don't need to prove anything. I just want to do something different. I just don't want to be bored. SHAPIRO: Well, Amanda Seyfried, it has been such a pleasure talking to you today. SEYFRIED: Thanks. SHAPIRO: Thank you very much. SEYFRIED: Thank you. You're so gentle, and I love your voice. And I love this show. SHAPIRO: Oh, thank you. SEYFRIED: So thanks for everything. SHAPIRO: Well, the feeling is mutual.

And it was one of those really impossible goals for me because I was the ingenue for a long time, and I just never saw myself as someone who could even pretend to have authority. So once I started playing roles - like, I played a lawyer once - it almost felt like a joke. You know, it almost felt like if I couldn't believe it, how is anyone else going to believe it? And this was finally a point in my career in which I felt that I was ready to tackle this - my own internal struggle - with authority and how I feel about myself. So I was like, this is a cop who's my age, has a kid and lives in a place that - very close to where I grew up, so it felt... SHAPIRO: Yeah. SEYFRIED: ...Kind of natural. SHAPIRO: It's set in this rough Philadelphia neighborhood of Kensington, where your character grew up, and you grew up just over an hour's drive away from there, in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Did you have a sense of what this place was like before you started working on the project? SEYFRIED: I knew Philly. I know Philly quite well. I know certain parts of Philly. It was a cultural hot spot for me. And having grown up - like, that was the closest big city so that we just - we would visit for culture. But I never had heard of Kensington until - I mean, I must have been well into my 20s when Kensington was - it was known as the hotspot for the opioid epidemic. SHAPIRO: Right. SEYFRIED: And I think, like most people, I only understood it for one thing. And that's part of the reason why I think Liz Moore's book, \"Long Bright River,\" did so well is because she wrote about an honest account and a new perspective on a community that is so marginalized and so feared and avoided because of the suffering, the addiction on the streets, the unhoused people, the sex workers, and not as a community that's actually quite resilient and a community of people who protect each other and kind of move like a well-oiled machine in some ways because they do look after each other. And so... SHAPIRO: Yeah. SEYFRIED: ...I think it was just - opened people's eyes to all these neighborhoods that we don't want to set foot in. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"LONG BRIGHT RIVER\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) How could somebody choose to live like that? SEYFRIED: (As Mickey) Like what? UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) This neighborhood used to be normal, man. We used to play baseball here with our kids. Sure, it was rough and tumble, but nothing like this. SEYFRIED: (As Mickey) Yeah, well, it's got its good parts, its bad parts, like any neighborhood. SHAPIRO: You know, your character is often the only woman in a room full of men, and the same could be said of Elizabeth Holmes, who you played a few years ago. Is there something that you especially connect with in that kind of a role? SEYFRIED: I think I'm always trying to evolve quickly through the people I play because I'm very well aware of the fact that I'm a people pleaser to a fault, and it gets in the way of my priorities. And it can make people in my life who are a priority feel less like a priority because I'm so anxious and aware of what I perceive as comfort for other people. And these two women, specifically Mickey, who's based on so many real people, and Elizabeth Holmes, who is a real person, they didn't waste their time trying to make other people comfortable.

Now, it's more like, yeah, we know she can do drama and comedy and musicals, and she's good at all of it. And so now that you have cleared that hurdle - or maybe you don't feel like you've cleared that hurdle, I'm not sure. But you've played the cop. You've checked that box. Like, if all of these paths are open to you, which paths look the most appealing next? SEYFRIED: The ones that couldn't be more different than the last character. But I do feel the respect in my industry, and it's wonderful. I don't feel like I have anything to prove. I didn't take on roles in my 30s to prove anything, but in my 20s, that's all I did. SHAPIRO: (Laughter) Yeah. SEYFRIED: So I feel like it's been a good, you know, almost 10 years where I've had more fun and had - some years, I would have more opportunities than others, depending on, you know, what hits and what doesn't. It's all a crapshoot. But I always stayed true to why I made these choices. You know when something's unique. SHAPIRO: Yeah. SEYFRIED: And I don't need to prove anything. I just want to do something different. I just don't want to be bored. SHAPIRO: Well, Amanda Seyfried, it has been such a pleasure talking to you today. SEYFRIED: Thanks. SHAPIRO: Thank you very much. SEYFRIED: Thank you. You're so gentle, and I love your voice. And I love this show. SHAPIRO: Oh, thank you. SEYFRIED: So thanks for everything. SHAPIRO: Well, the feeling is mutual.

Did you have a sense of what this place was like before you started working on the project? SEYFRIED: I knew Philly. I know Philly quite well. I know certain parts of Philly. It was a cultural hot spot for me. And having grown up - like, that was the closest big city so that we just - we would visit for culture. But I never had heard of Kensington until - I mean, I must have been well into my 20s when Kensington was - it was known as the hotspot for the opioid epidemic. SHAPIRO: Right. SEYFRIED: And I think, like most people, I only understood it for one thing. And that's part of the reason why I think Liz Moore's book, \"Long Bright River,\" did so well is because she wrote about an honest account and a new perspective on a community that is so marginalized and so feared and avoided because of the suffering, the addiction on the streets, the unhoused people, the sex workers, and not as a community that's actually quite resilient and a community of people who protect each other and kind of move like a well-oiled machine in some ways because they do look after each other. And so... SHAPIRO: Yeah. SEYFRIED: ...I think it was just - opened people's eyes to all these neighborhoods that we don't want to set foot in. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"LONG BRIGHT RIVER\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) How could somebody choose to live like that? SEYFRIED: (As Mickey) Like what? UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) This neighborhood used to be normal, man. We used to play baseball here with our kids. Sure, it was rough and tumble, but nothing like this. SEYFRIED: (As Mickey) Yeah, well, it's got its good parts, its bad parts, like any neighborhood. SHAPIRO: You know, your character is often the only woman in a room full of men, and the same could be said of Elizabeth Holmes, who you played a few years ago. Is there something that you especially connect with in that kind of a role? SEYFRIED: I think I'm always trying to evolve quickly through the people I play because I'm very well aware of the fact that I'm a people pleaser to a fault, and it gets in the way of my priorities. And it can make people in my life who are a priority feel less like a priority because I'm so anxious and aware of what I perceive as comfort for other people. And these two women, specifically Mickey, who's based on so many real people, and Elizabeth Holmes, who is a real person, they didn't waste their time trying to make other people comfortable. They just did what they needed to do when they needed to do it. And the more I play these people, the more aware I am of my failings, and I give myself grace, too. SHAPIRO: But it's so interesting to me to hear that these two characters, who are struggling with so many problems and have so much adversity and have so many challenges, are people who you, Amanda Seyfried, look up to in a way and... SEYFRIED: Absolutely. SHAPIRO: ...Aspire to be more like in a way. SEYFRIED: Well, also, when you're acting, when you're portraying somebody, a way to honor the work at hand and to make it really count is to empathize as much as humanly possible. Of course, we all have our opinions about Elizabeth Holmes. But she's a human being, and she's not all bad. She's a three-dimensional person, and we create stories to do that, to create some kind of space for these people to exist as three-dimensional people. And even though we're trying to enhance the situation for television, the point is to still get to know this person in a different way. SHAPIRO: So from where I sit, it looks to me like you have passed the point in your career where people say with surprise, wow, she can really do anything.

SHAPIRO: You know, your character is often the only woman in a room full of men, and the same could be said of Elizabeth Holmes, who you played a few years ago. Is there something that you especially connect with in that kind of a role? SEYFRIED: I think I'm always trying to evolve quickly through the people I play because I'm very well aware of the fact that I'm a people pleaser to a fault, and it gets in the way of my priorities. And it can make people in my life who are a priority feel less like a priority because I'm so anxious and aware of what I perceive as comfort for other people. And these two women, specifically Mickey, who's based on so many real people, and Elizabeth Holmes, who is a real person, they didn't waste their time trying to make other people comfortable. They just did what they needed to do when they needed to do it. And the more I play these people, the more aware I am of my failings, and I give myself grace, too. SHAPIRO: But it's so interesting to me to hear that these two characters, who are struggling with so many problems and have so much adversity and have so many challenges, are people who you, Amanda Seyfried, look up to in a way and... SEYFRIED: Absolutely. SHAPIRO: ...Aspire to be more like in a way. SEYFRIED: Well, also, when you're acting, when you're portraying somebody, a way to honor the work at hand and to make it really count is to empathize as much as humanly possible. Of course, we all have our opinions about Elizabeth Holmes. But she's a human being, and she's not all bad. She's a three-dimensional person, and we create stories to do that, to create some kind of space for these people to exist as three-dimensional people. And even though we're trying to enhance the situation for television, the point is to still get to know this person in a different way. SHAPIRO: So from where I sit, it looks to me like you have passed the point in your career where people say with surprise, wow, she can really do anything. Now, it's more like, yeah, we know she can do drama and comedy and musicals, and she's good at all of it. And so now that you have cleared that hurdle - or maybe you don't feel like you've cleared that hurdle, I'm not sure. But you've played the cop. You've checked that box. Like, if all of these paths are open to you, which paths look the most appealing next? SEYFRIED: The ones that couldn't be more different than the last character. But I do feel the respect in my industry, and it's wonderful. I don't feel like I have anything to prove. I didn't take on roles in my 30s to prove anything, but in my 20s, that's all I did. SHAPIRO: (Laughter) Yeah. SEYFRIED: So I feel like it's been a good, you know, almost 10 years where I've had more fun and had - some years, I would have more opportunities than others, depending on, you know, what hits and what doesn't. It's all a crapshoot. But I always stayed true to why I made these choices. You know when something's unique. SHAPIRO: Yeah. SEYFRIED: And I don't need to prove anything. I just want to do something different. I just don't want to be bored. SHAPIRO: Well, Amanda Seyfried, it has been such a pleasure talking to you today. SEYFRIED: Thanks. SHAPIRO: Thank you very much. SEYFRIED: Thank you. You're so gentle, and I love your voice. And I love this show. SHAPIRO: Oh, thank you. SEYFRIED: So thanks for everything. SHAPIRO: Well, the feeling is mutual.

And that's part of the reason why I think Liz Moore's book, \"Long Bright River,\" did so well is because she wrote about an honest account and a new perspective on a community that is so marginalized and so feared and avoided because of the suffering, the addiction on the streets, the unhoused people, the sex workers, and not as a community that's actually quite resilient and a community of people who protect each other and kind of move like a well-oiled machine in some ways because they do look after each other. And so... SHAPIRO: Yeah. SEYFRIED: ...I think it was just - opened people's eyes to all these neighborhoods that we don't want to set foot in.

But I do feel the respect in my industry, and it's wonderful. I don't feel like I have anything to prove. I didn't take on roles in my 30s to prove anything, but in my 20s, that's all I did. SHAPIRO: (Laughter) Yeah. SEYFRIED: So I feel like it's been a good, you know, almost 10 years where I've had more fun and had - some years, I would have more opportunities than others, depending on, you know, what hits and what doesn't. It's all a crapshoot. But I always stayed true to why I made these choices. You know when something's unique. SHAPIRO: Yeah. SEYFRIED: And I don't need to prove anything. I just want to do something different. I just don't want to be bored. SHAPIRO: Well, Amanda Seyfried, it has been such a pleasure talking to you today. SEYFRIED: Thanks. SHAPIRO: Thank you very much. SEYFRIED: Thank you. You're so gentle, and I love your voice. And I love this show. SHAPIRO: Oh, thank you. SEYFRIED: So thanks for everything. SHAPIRO: Well, the feeling is mutual.

SEYFRIED: (As Mickey) Like what? UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) This neighborhood used to be normal, man. We used to play baseball here with our kids. Sure, it was rough and tumble, but nothing like this. SEYFRIED: (As Mickey) Yeah, well, it's got its good parts, its bad parts, like any neighborhood. SHAPIRO: You know, your character is often the only woman in a room full of men, and the same could be said of Elizabeth Holmes, who you played a few years ago. Is there something that you especially connect with in that kind of a role? SEYFRIED: I think I'm always trying to evolve quickly through the people I play because I'm very well aware of the fact that I'm a people pleaser to a fault, and it gets in the way of my priorities. And it can make people in my life who are a priority feel less like a priority because I'm so anxious and aware of what I perceive as comfort for other people. And these two women, specifically Mickey, who's based on so many real people, and Elizabeth Holmes, who is a real person, they didn't waste their time trying to make other people comfortable. They just did what they needed to do when they needed to do it. And the more I play these people, the more aware I am of my failings, and I give myself grace, too. SHAPIRO: But it's so interesting to me to hear that these two characters, who are struggling with so many problems and have so much adversity and have so many challenges, are people who you, Amanda Seyfried, look up to in a way and... SEYFRIED: Absolutely. SHAPIRO: ...Aspire to be more like in a way. SEYFRIED: Well, also, when you're acting, when you're portraying somebody, a way to honor the work at hand and to make it really count is to empathize as much as humanly possible. Of course, we all have our opinions about Elizabeth Holmes. But she's a human being, and she's not all bad. She's a three-dimensional person, and we create stories to do that, to create some kind of space for these people to exist as three-dimensional people. And even though we're trying to enhance the situation for television, the point is to still get to know this person in a different way. SHAPIRO: So from where I sit, it looks to me like you have passed the point in your career where people say with surprise, wow, she can really do anything. Now, it's more like, yeah, we know she can do drama and comedy and musicals, and she's good at all of it. And so now that you have cleared that hurdle - or maybe you don't feel like you've cleared that hurdle, I'm not sure. But you've played the cop. You've checked that box. Like, if all of these paths are open to you, which paths look the most appealing next? SEYFRIED: The ones that couldn't be more different than the last character.

SEYFRIED: So I feel like it's been a good, you know, almost 10 years where I've had more fun and had - some years, I would have more opportunities than others, depending on, you know, what hits and what doesn't. It's all a crapshoot. But I always stayed true to why I made these choices. You know when something's unique. SHAPIRO: Yeah. SEYFRIED: And I don't need to prove anything. I just want to do something different. I just don't want to be bored. SHAPIRO: Well, Amanda Seyfried, it has been such a pleasure talking to you today. SEYFRIED: Thanks. SHAPIRO: Thank you very much. SEYFRIED: Thank you. You're so gentle, and I love your voice. And I love this show. SHAPIRO: Oh, thank you. SEYFRIED: So thanks for everything. SHAPIRO: Well, the feeling is mutual.

Sure, it was rough and tumble, but nothing like this. SEYFRIED: (As Mickey) Yeah, well, it's got its good parts, its bad parts, like any neighborhood. SHAPIRO: You know, your character is often the only woman in a room full of men, and the same could be said of Elizabeth Holmes, who you played a few years ago. Is there something that you especially connect with in that kind of a role? SEYFRIED: I think I'm always trying to evolve quickly through the people I play because I'm very well aware of the fact that I'm a people pleaser to a fault, and it gets in the way of my priorities. And it can make people in my life who are a priority feel less like a priority because I'm so anxious and aware of what I perceive as comfort for other people. And these two women, specifically Mickey, who's based on so many real people, and Elizabeth Holmes, who is a real person, they didn't waste their time trying to make other people comfortable. They just did what they needed to do when they needed to do it. And the more I play these people, the more aware I am of my failings, and I give myself grace, too. SHAPIRO: But it's so interesting to me to hear that these two characters, who are struggling with so many problems and have so much adversity and have so many challenges, are people who you, Amanda Seyfried, look up to in a way and... SEYFRIED: Absolutely. SHAPIRO: ...Aspire to be more like in a way. SEYFRIED: Well, also, when you're acting, when you're portraying somebody, a way to honor the work at hand and to make it really count is to empathize as much as humanly possible. Of course, we all have our opinions about Elizabeth Holmes. But she's a human being, and she's not all bad. She's a three-dimensional person, and we create stories to do that, to create some kind of space for these people to exist as three-dimensional people. And even though we're trying to enhance the situation for television, the point is to still get to know this person in a different way. SHAPIRO: So from where I sit, it looks to me like you have passed the point in your career where people say with surprise, wow, she can really do anything. Now, it's more like, yeah, we know she can do drama and comedy and musicals, and she's good at all of it. And so now that you have cleared that hurdle - or maybe you don't feel like you've cleared that hurdle, I'm not sure. But you've played the cop. You've checked that box. Like, if all of these paths are open to you, which paths look the most appealing next? SEYFRIED: The ones that couldn't be more different than the last character. But I do feel the respect in my industry, and it's wonderful. I don't feel like I have anything to prove. I didn't take on roles in my 30s to prove anything, but in my 20s, that's all I did. SHAPIRO: (Laughter) Yeah.

But I do feel the respect in my industry, and it's wonderful. I don't feel like I have anything to prove. I didn't take on roles in my 30s to prove anything, but in my 20s, that's all I did. SHAPIRO: (Laughter) Yeah. SEYFRIED: So I feel like it's been a good, you know, almost 10 years where I've had more fun and had - some years, I would have more opportunities than others, depending on, you know, what hits and what doesn't. It's all a crapshoot. But I always stayed true to why I made these choices. You know when something's unique. SHAPIRO: Yeah. SEYFRIED: And I don't need to prove anything. I just want to do something different. I just don't want to be bored. SHAPIRO: Well, Amanda Seyfried, it has been such a pleasure talking to you today. SEYFRIED: Thanks. SHAPIRO: Thank you very much. SEYFRIED: Thank you. You're so gentle, and I love your voice. And I love this show. SHAPIRO: Oh, thank you. SEYFRIED: So thanks for everything. SHAPIRO: Well, the feeling is mutual.

SEYFRIED: Absolutely. SHAPIRO: ...Aspire to be more like in a way. SEYFRIED: Well, also, when you're acting, when you're portraying somebody, a way to honor the work at hand and to make it really count is to empathize as much as humanly possible. Of course, we all have our opinions about Elizabeth Holmes. But she's a human being, and she's not all bad. She's a three-dimensional person, and we create stories to do that, to create some kind of space for these people to exist as three-dimensional people. And even though we're trying to enhance the situation for television, the point is to still get to know this person in a different way. SHAPIRO: So from where I sit, it looks to me like you have passed the point in your career where people say with surprise, wow, she can really do anything. Now, it's more like, yeah, we know she can do drama and comedy and musicals, and she's good at all of it.

      "text": "Disappointed by this year's climate talks, Indigenous advocates look to Brazil in 2025\n\nBy\n\nNate Perez\n\nIndigenous women of Amazonia speak to the media at a press conference during United Nations Climate Change Conference COP29. Dominika Zarzycka/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images hide caption\n\nSome Indigenous advocates at this year's international climate negotiations in Baku, Azerbaijan say the deals made fall short of what's needed to stave off the worst impacts of a warming planet, from sea level rise to catastrophic storms. COP29 ended with wealthy countries agreeing to help poorer nations with at least $300 billion annually to address global warming in a last-minute deal.\n\nAdvocates are now looking to next year's climate talks in Brazil, which some are calling the \"Indigenous peoples\" COP, to push for further inclusion in climate negotiations and support the global Indigenous movement.\n\nThis year, a group within COP known as the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform came to Baku with a set of priorities, which included advocating for a formal seat at the negotiating table for climate initiatives. They also wanted more Indigenous knowledge incorporated into climate science and policies. Leaders also called for protecting the human rights of Indigenous people and to safeguard tribal nations feeling the most adverse effects of climate change.\n\n\"Broadly speaking, the COP outcomes failed on all four of those [priorities],\" explains Graeme Reed, who is Anishinaabe from the Great Lakes region. He was the North American representative to what's called the Facilitative Working Group , which carries out the platform's climate priorities by advising state party representatives that are willing to listen. These representatives can then bring ideas up in formal negotiations.\n\nReed called the final agreement out of COP29 \"drastically insufficient.\"\n\nJanene Yazzie, who is Diné (Navajo), also expressed disappointment. She joined Reed in the Facilitative Working Group as a North American representative. She says, despite the outcome, it's important for Indigenous people to build solidarity during the talks.\n\n\"It's very important for us to be here [in Baku] to advocate for our people to hold the line for effective and meaningful climate action and to continue to fight for the ability to access available climate finance that exists on the global scale,\" Yazzie says.\n\nThe climate finance deal nearly didn't happen after some developing nations walked out of negotiations over the weekend. Still, some have called the $300 billion a step in the right direction. Among them, President Biden, who said in a statement that the agreement was \"ambitious\" and that the money will help \"mobilize the level of finance - from all sources - that developing countries need to accelerate the transition to clean, sustainable economies, while opening up new markets for American-made electric vehicles, batteries and other products.\"\n\nAround 170 Indigenous people from around the world traveled to Baku. Groups representing Indigenous people across national borders do not have an official role when it comes to negotiating climate policy at COP. But they can advise countries willing to hear them out.\n\nEriel Tchekwie Deranger is a member of the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation in Alberta, Canada and the executive director of the nonprofit Indigenous Climate Action.\n\n\"[We have] to really hope that sort of sympathetic states will listen to our desires and needs,\" Deranger says. \"It's been really difficult, to be honest.\"\n\nProtesters demonstrate for Indigenous land rights and climate justice on day six at COP29 this November in Baku, Azerbaijan. Sean Gallup/Getty Images hide caption\n\nIndigenous organizations have become a growing part of COPs. But Deranger says participation was down this year. She points to Azerbaijan being so far away for many groups, expensive flights and concerns about the country's human rights record .\n\nA recent analysis revealed that at least 1,773 fossil fuel lobbyists registered to attend COP29 . Deranger said that far outnumbered Indigenous representation in Baku.\n\nMany Indigenous leaders at COP29 acknowledged the need for the renewable energy transition. However, many worry about mining for critical minerals that's needed for technologies that reduce climate pollution, like batteries, solar panels and electric vehicles. Mines are often on or near tribal lands. In the U.S., an analysis found more than 75% of lithium, copper and nickel reserves in the U.S . are located within 35 miles of Indigenous communities. Another study found that globally, 54% of all the minerals needed for the green energy transition are located on or near Indigenous lands .\n\nReed worries that the current demand for critical minerals legitimizes what he calls \"sacrifice zones\"- critical mineral sites near Indigenous and poor communities that can bring an increased risk of sexual violence for Native women , contaminate waterways and create more air pollution.\n\n\"We have all these technocrats who come to these gatherings, and they advance these solutions without really actually thinking about what is the future they're creating,\" Reed says. \"For me, that future that they're creating is increasing inequity.\"\n\nNot all tribal nations oppose mineral extraction on their territories. \"Some want the mining, some don't want the mining,\" says David Kaimowitz, who's the chief program officer at the Tenure Facility, an organization that supports Indigenous people's land rights and forest management.\n\n\"I would say they want the right to decide what's going to happen in their ancestral territories, where their forefathers and foremothers are buried, where they hope to raise their grandchildren and their grandchildren's grandchildren,\" Kamowitz says.\n\nUnder international law, Indigenous people have the right to free, prior, and informed consent , which allows tribal nations to decide what's going to happen on their territories, such as mining, solar and hydroelectric projects.\n\nHeavy trucks drive through a nickel mining area in South Sulawesi, Indonesia. A recdnt study found that globally, 54% of all the minerals needed for the green energy transition are located on or near Indigenous lands. Hariandi Hafid/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images hide caption\n\nThe 16th United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity in Colombia this fall formerly recognized Indigenous people for their expertise. Reed says that's a step in the right direction.\n\nBut getting \"tangible decision-making participation\" at the formal negotiations at COP, he says, is still a long shot given that negotiations happen between governments, nations and states.\n\nIndigenous people, Kaimowitz says, have had some success raising awareness and significant funds outside the formal UN climate talks, such as a $1.7 billion commitment to protect Indigenous peoples rights and forests. This agreement came together during COP26 in Scotland in 2021 and was established by five governments and 25 public and philanthropic donors. According to the Forest Tenure Funders Group, nearly $1.3 billion has been distributed already.\n\nA recent report by the group, found a majority of that money - over a billion dollars - has gone to consulting firms, governments and NGO's. Reed says the funds that actually go to Indigenous people are minuscule compared to what government and conservation organizations receive.\n\n\"While those things are good, and I appreciate the advocacy that Indigenous peoples have brought,\" explains Reed, \"the underlying system is still deeply colonial and is still unwilling to share power.\"\n\nThe U.S. election also loomed over this year's COP. Indigenous advocates are concerned over whether President-elect Donald Trump will withdraw the U.S. again from the Paris Agreement, something he did during his first term. Trump has said he will likely withdraw the country again from an agreement that set a global goal to limit warming to certain levels .\n\nYazzie also worries Trump's second term will lead to fewer federal dollars for tribes in the U.S.- money that could address the effects of climate change such as sea level rise.\n\nThat's a concern Fawn Sharp shares. She's a Quinault Indian Nation tribal member and a board member of the Nature Conservancy Global. Her tribe is feeling the effects of sea-level rise in Washington state and needs funds to relocate to higher ground .\n\nThe tribe received $25 million to relocate some villages through the Biden administration . But Sharp says Quinault Nation needs $500 million more to move all the villages.\n\n\"We knew it was quite clear we're not going to see that coming out of the United States Congress any time soon,\" Sharp says. That's why, she says, they're looking internationally for partnerships \"to move to higher ground, to restore our salmon habitat and build our ecosystems.\"\n\nBrazil hosts next year's United Nations climate summit and already some are calling it the \"Indigenous Peoples\" COP.\n\nThat's because Brazil is where 305 ethnic groups and 1.7 million Indigenous people call home . Indigenous people are also included in government representation including establishing the Brazilian Ministry of Indigenous Peoples in 2023.\n\nCOP30 will mark the first time the climate summit will be held in the Amazon basin - home to the world's largest tropical rainforest which naturally stores planet-warming pollution. The Amazon continues to face significant challenges, including deforestation and human-caused climate change, which has brought increased temperatures and drought.\n\nDeranger and Yazzie say they are already preparing for Brazil, where they plan to continue advocating for Indigenous rights and representation.\n\n\"Brazil's gonna definitely be the largest Indigenous participation in COP history,\" Yazzie says.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

He thinks it has been six. Maybe seven.\n\nThere was the family dispute involving vandalism to a car. He needs to write reports on stolen property and a woman being harassed on Facebook. But first, he has to help search for a missing woman who may be suicidal.\n\n\"I'm backed up,\" he says.\n\nThere are supposed to be six officers patrolling this territory; three are on duty today, including one who's already into overtime.\n\nOn one fall morning, Bruckhart handled about a half-dozen calls ... so many he cannot keep count. Ryan Caron King/Connecticut Public Radio hide caption\n\nOn one fall morning, Bruckhart handled about a half-dozen calls ... so many he cannot keep count.\n\nThe New Haven Police Department simply doesn't have enough cops. It's a nationwide problem, as agencies that slowed or froze hiring during the recession are now struggling to build their ranks up again in the middle of a hot job market. Officers are retiring faster than they can be replaced.\n\nNew Haven is worse off than others. At last count, the department was 100 officers short.\n\nPart of the problem is money - evident in the department's worn-out squad cars, one of which has a rust hole in the floorboard that has been patched with an old license plate. Suburban police departments can offer better pay and are luring away New Haven's midlevel officers.\n\nThe result is a department that's both short-staffed and green.\n\n\"I think it should scare the community more than anybody,\" Bruckhart says. \"Because you go to some of these evening shifts and, you know, we have brand-new officers out there who are asking each other what to do on some of these calls. There's no veteran leadership.\"\n\nBruckhart works in the New Haven Police Department's Fair Haven substation. Like many law enforcement agencies across the country, the department doesn't have enough officers. New Haven is 100 officers short.

New Haven is 100 officers short.\n\nThe severity of the officer shortage varies from department to department, but the national trend is clear: Since 2013, the total number of working sworn officers has fallen by about 23,000. The number of officers per capita is down even more sharply, from 2.42 per 1,000 residents in 1997 to 2.17 officers per 1,000 in 2016.\n\nI think it should scare the community more than anybody.\n\nNew Haven Officer Christian Bruckhart\n\nRecruiters blame the hot job market, as well as greater skepticism about law enforcement as a career choice. That skepticism has grown in the past few years, fed by viral videos of controversial incidents of use of force by police. Where hundreds of people used to apply for a job opening, now it's often only a handful.\n\nUndersheriff Jeff Mori's agency in Oregon's Washington County has started allowing officers to have facial hair and tattoos.

The agency is understaffed by about 55 people.\n\n\"It's become more like recruiting for a football team,\" says Undersheriff Jeff Mori, of Oregon's Washington County. His agency is short about 55 people and relies heavily on mandatory overtime to cover all the necessary shifts. He says seeking out enough new recruits is a full-time preoccupation, and it has pushed the agency to change some of its requirements.\n\nHoles in the floorboards of a New Haven Police Department squad car have been patched with an old license plate.

Ryan Caron King/Connecticut Public Radio hide caption\n\nOfficer Christian Bruckhart checks in with a resident of New Haven's Fair Haven neighborhood. Community building is a priority for many younger officers.\n\n\"They want to do something that's bigger than themselves,\" Mori says. \"They view themselves as community-builders, as opposed to the warrior or even the guardian.\"\n\nIt's become more like recruiting for a football team.\n\nWashington County, Ore., Undersheriff Jeff Mori\n\nDeputy Chief Valerie Cunningham, who runs training and recruiting for the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police, has noticed the same trend.\n\n\"I think we have to recruit differently, and I think they're going to end up policing differently,\" Cunningham says. \"But I don't think it's a negative, I think it's a positive.\"\n\nShe thinks the recruiting crunch is pushing departments to cater more to young Americans' preference for community policing, which she sees as the direction departments should be going in.\n\nStill, that's a long-term process. Cunningham's more immediate concern is rebuilding the ranks of the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department, which is also short-handed.\n\nCompeting for cops\n\nThe fact that this shortage is being felt nationwide means she has to worry about other departments hiring away her officers.\n\nThe official term for this is \"lateral hiring.\" Unofficially, it's called \"poaching.\"\n\n\" 'Poaching' is, yeah, the less-polite term, but it's exactly what it is,\" says Cunningham. Earlier this fall, the Seattle Police Department put up a billboard in Indianapolis, advertising its interest in hiring away local cops.\n\n\"I've been in this career for 27 years. I've never seen a billboard pop up from another agency in our own backyard,\" Cunningham says.\n\nSeattle, which is trying to emerge from a federal consent decree to reform its use of force practices, is both short-staffed and eager to increase the racial diversity in its ranks. The department's \"lateral officer\" recruiting video features an African-American officer expressing satisfaction with good compensation and less rain than you would expect.\n\nBut lateral hires do nothing to solve the national shortage of officers, and many departments are starting to find ways to live with the new reality of a smaller police force. In Washington County, Undersheriff Mori says one solution may be more technology.\n\n\"The predictive analysis software that is being rolled out right now is going to be hugely beneficial,\" he says. \"So we don't just randomly patrol, so we'll be more strategic about where send our resources.\"\n\nThe Washington County Sheriff's Office has also experimented with a portable facial recognition system, to speed up identification of potential suspects in the field.\n\nNone of those technologies are enough to make up for the current shortage of available humans, though, and Mori says that until he can find more qualified applicants, his current deputies are going to be stuck working a lot of overtime; as he puts it, \"being held hostage to their jobs.\"\n\nOfficer Christian Bruckhart says the shortage of officers and the lack of veteran leadership on some shifts \"should scare the community more than anybody.\" Ryan Caron King/Connecticut Public Radio hide caption\n\nOfficer Christian Bruckhart says the shortage of officers and the lack of veteran leadership on some shifts \"should scare the community more than anybody.\"\n\nThere are supposed to be six officers patrolling Bruckhart's territory, but there are days when there are half that.

A protester was killed by police in January, and others have been charged with domestic terrorism.\n\nLEILA FADEL, HOST: In Atlanta, the fight over whether to build a new police training facility dubbed Cop City has gotten more dangerous. One activist was killed by police in January. And now officials are accusing others of being, quote, \"domestic terrorists.\" The use of that charge is alarming civil liberties and human rights groups across the country. NPR's domestic extremism correspondent Odette Yousef reports. ODETTE YOUSEF, BYLINE: Luke Harper finally left Georgia in early June. He had gone there for a music festival protesting Cop City. He figured it would just be a weekend. But on his second night, he and nearly two dozen others were arrested and accused of being domestic terrorists. LUKE HARPER: I was released on Day 90, which is basically the last day that they could legally keep me incarcerated without an indictment. YOUSEF: Atlanta's police chief claimed the arrests were related to vandalism that had happened earlier in the day. At the location of the proposed facility, a different site, some people had torched a construction vehicle and thrown Molotov cocktails at police. Harper says he had nothing to do with that and that over multiple bond hearings and a preliminary hearing, the state offered no evidence to connect him to those crimes. The Atlanta Police Department didn't make itself available for an interview. But even without formal charges or evidence, Harper has been called a domestic terrorist by law enforcement. And just going through the airport in Atlanta to leave, he noticed a change. HARPER: I'm a person of color. I have been patted down many times at the airport. It was nothing necessarily new. But 40 to 45 minutes going through my things? YOUSEF: It happened at security. It happened again at his gate and then again in Salt Lake City, where he had a layover. Harper noticed his boarding pass had something new in the lower corner, four S's - secondary security screening selection. The TSA doesn't say why someone is selected, but Harper thinks he's been flagged to local and federal agencies. Atlanta officials who support the new construction say it's time to replace the city's deteriorating public safety training facilities. But when it became known that it would be more than twice as large as other police training campuses, that it would require razing 85 acres of old-growth forest, that it would cost tens of millions of dollars more than initially disclosed and that much funding would come from Atlanta-based multinational corporations, the ideological left was activated. Matt Scott is a journalist with the Atlanta Community Press Collective. MATT SCOTT: You have the fight against environmental defense. You have the fight for racial equality. You have the fight against capitalism. And of course, you have the fight against police militarization or the fight for abolition. YOUSEF: That last concern about how this massive campus might further militarize police has felt salient to many in the movement. In January, a Georgia state patrol officer killed an activist named Manuel Teran while clearing an encampment of Cop City protesters. Police claimed Teran had shot and injured an officer. But autopsy results from the DeKalb County medical examiner's office have called that into question. (SOUNDBITE OF MACHINE WHIRRING) YOUSEF: This past Saturday, activists gathered again to kick off a week of action against Cop City. As kids played on a bouncy house and people made protest art, the police cruisers in the area were conspicuous. That evening, uniformed officers appeared in the park. A couple dozen assembled in a line. And there was briefly a stunned silence as they walked toward the protesters. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER: Just a friendly reminder to let everybody know that the park will be closing at 11 o'clock. And everything has to be removed from the park at that time. YOUSEF: But many said it didn't feel friendly. The police had been circling in their vehicles all day. And the very moment they appeared in the park was just when the vigil was starting for slain activist Manuel Teran, known to them as Tortuguita. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #1: Murderers. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER: Don't worry, folks. It's all under control. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #2: Murderers. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER: I'm with them. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: Viva, viva Tortuguita. Viva, viva Tortuguita. YOUSEF: Atlanta has a history of activists whose ideas challenge the authority of the state. And as police tensely walked the length of the park surrounded by angry demonstrators, Keyanna Jones summoned some of that history. KEYANNA JONES: (Singing) Ain't going to let nobody turn us around, turn us around, turn us around. Ain't going to let nobody. Dr. King was labeled an outside agitator at some point. And he's born right here in the city of Atlanta, just like I am. YOUSEF: Jones says Republican leaders in Georgia are invoking the same language now, describing demonstrators as outside agitators. But she says it's inaccurate. She herself lived right next to the training facility site and had to move away because the police were already using it for target training. The constant gunfire created chronic stress for her 8-year-old son. But Attorney General Chris Carr has leaned hard on the outside agitator narrative. Here he is in an interview on Atlanta TV station WANF. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHRIS CARR: If you come to this state, engage in acts of violence to destroy infrastructure and property with the intended effect of changing public policy, it is a domestic terrorism charge. YOUSEF: But Lauren Regan of the Civil Liberties Defense Center says many states have terrorism statutes, and they can be misused. LAUREN REGAN: They claim that they're passing these types of laws to deal with mass shooting and, like, mass murder of civilian populations. But yet legislators are using it as a cudgel against political activists and against people who dissent against state power. YOUSEF: There may be signs that the prosecution is now struggling with how to charge Cop City defendants. So far, none of the 42 accused of domestic terrorism has been indicted. And late last week, one of the two offices prosecuting them abruptly recused itself from the case. One of the defendants is challenging the constitutionality of Georgia's domestic terrorism statute. Meanwhile, opponents of Cop City see one last legal avenue to stop the project. They're gathering signatures for a referendum that could potentially stop the plan altogether. Odette Yousef, NPR News.

But 40 to 45 minutes going through my things? YOUSEF: It happened at security. It happened again at his gate and then again in Salt Lake City, where he had a layover. Harper noticed his boarding pass had something new in the lower corner, four S's - secondary security screening selection. The TSA doesn't say why someone is selected, but Harper thinks he's been flagged to local and federal agencies. Atlanta officials who support the new construction say it's time to replace the city's deteriorating public safety training facilities. But when it became known that it would be more than twice as large as other police training campuses, that it would require razing 85 acres of old-growth forest, that it would cost tens of millions of dollars more than initially disclosed and that much funding would come from Atlanta-based multinational corporations, the ideological left was activated.

In January, a Georgia state patrol officer killed an activist named Manuel Teran while clearing an encampment of Cop City protesters. Police claimed Teran had shot and injured an officer. But autopsy results from the DeKalb County medical examiner's office have called that into question.

KEYANNA JONES: (Singing) Ain't going to let nobody turn us around, turn us around, turn us around. Ain't going to let nobody. Dr. King was labeled an outside agitator at some point. And he's born right here in the city of Atlanta, just like I am. YOUSEF: Jones says Republican leaders in Georgia are invoking the same language now, describing demonstrators as outside agitators. But she says it's inaccurate. She herself lived right next to the training facility site and had to move away because the police were already using it for target training. The constant gunfire created chronic stress for her 8-year-old son. But Attorney General Chris Carr has leaned hard on the outside agitator narrative. Here he is in an interview on Atlanta TV station WANF.

YOUSEF: But Lauren Regan of the Civil Liberties Defense Center says many states have terrorism statutes, and they can be misused. LAUREN REGAN: They claim that they're passing these types of laws to deal with mass shooting and, like, mass murder of civilian populations. But yet legislators are using it as a cudgel against political activists and against people who dissent against state power. YOUSEF: There may be signs that the prosecution is now struggling with how to charge Cop City defendants. So far, none of the 42 accused of domestic terrorism has been indicted. And late last week, one of the two offices prosecuting them abruptly recused itself from the case. One of the defendants is challenging the constitutionality of Georgia's domestic terrorism statute.

He had gone there for a music festival protesting Cop City. He figured it would just be a weekend. But on his second night, he and nearly two dozen others were arrested and accused of being domestic terrorists. LUKE HARPER: I was released on Day 90, which is basically the last day that they could legally keep me incarcerated without an indictment. YOUSEF: Atlanta's police chief claimed the arrests were related to vandalism that had happened earlier in the day. At the location of the proposed facility, a different site, some people had torched a construction vehicle and thrown Molotov cocktails at police. Harper says he had nothing to do with that and that over multiple bond hearings and a preliminary hearing, the state offered no evidence to connect him to those crimes. The Atlanta Police Department didn't make itself available for an interview. But even without formal charges or evidence, Harper has been called a domestic terrorist by law enforcement. And just going through the airport in Atlanta to leave, he noticed a change. HARPER: I'm a person of color. I have been patted down many times at the airport. It was nothing necessarily new.

I have been patted down many times at the airport. It was nothing necessarily new. But 40 to 45 minutes going through my things? YOUSEF: It happened at security. It happened again at his gate and then again in Salt Lake City, where he had a layover. Harper noticed his boarding pass had something new in the lower corner, four S's - secondary security screening selection. The TSA doesn't say why someone is selected, but Harper thinks he's been flagged to local and federal agencies. Atlanta officials who support the new construction say it's time to replace the city's deteriorating public safety training facilities. But when it became known that it would be more than twice as large as other police training campuses, that it would require razing 85 acres of old-growth forest, that it would cost tens of millions of dollars more than initially disclosed and that much funding would come from Atlanta-based multinational corporations, the ideological left was activated. Matt Scott is a journalist with the Atlanta Community Press Collective. MATT SCOTT: You have the fight against environmental defense. You have the fight for racial equality. You have the fight against capitalism. And of course, you have the fight against police militarization or the fight for abolition. YOUSEF: That last concern about how this massive campus might further militarize police has felt salient to many in the movement. In January, a Georgia state patrol officer killed an activist named Manuel Teran while clearing an encampment of Cop City protesters. Police claimed Teran had shot and injured an officer. But autopsy results from the DeKalb County medical examiner's office have called that into question. (SOUNDBITE OF MACHINE WHIRRING) YOUSEF: This past Saturday, activists gathered again to kick off a week of action against Cop City. As kids played on a bouncy house and people made protest art, the police cruisers in the area were conspicuous. That evening, uniformed officers appeared in the park. A couple dozen assembled in a line. And there was briefly a stunned silence as they walked toward the protesters. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER: Just a friendly reminder to let everybody know that the park will be closing at 11 o'clock. And everything has to be removed from the park at that time. YOUSEF: But many said it didn't feel friendly. The police had been circling in their vehicles all day. And the very moment they appeared in the park was just when the vigil was starting for slain activist Manuel Teran, known to them as Tortuguita. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #1: Murderers. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER: Don't worry, folks. It's all under control. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #2: Murderers. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER: I'm with them. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: Viva, viva Tortuguita. Viva, viva Tortuguita. YOUSEF: Atlanta has a history of activists whose ideas challenge the authority of the state. And as police tensely walked the length of the park surrounded by angry demonstrators, Keyanna Jones summoned some of that history. KEYANNA JONES: (Singing) Ain't going to let nobody turn us around, turn us around, turn us around. Ain't going to let nobody. Dr. King was labeled an outside agitator at some point. And he's born right here in the city of Atlanta, just like I am. YOUSEF: Jones says Republican leaders in Georgia are invoking the same language now, describing demonstrators as outside agitators. But she says it's inaccurate. She herself lived right next to the training facility site and had to move away because the police were already using it for target training. The constant gunfire created chronic stress for her 8-year-old son. But Attorney General Chris Carr has leaned hard on the outside agitator narrative. Here he is in an interview on Atlanta TV station WANF. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHRIS CARR: If you come to this state, engage in acts of violence to destroy infrastructure and property with the intended effect of changing public policy, it is a domestic terrorism charge. YOUSEF: But Lauren Regan of the Civil Liberties Defense Center says many states have terrorism statutes, and they can be misused. LAUREN REGAN: They claim that they're passing these types of laws to deal with mass shooting and, like, mass murder of civilian populations. But yet legislators are using it as a cudgel against political activists and against people who dissent against state power. YOUSEF: There may be signs that the prosecution is now struggling with how to charge Cop City defendants. So far, none of the 42 accused of domestic terrorism has been indicted.

You have the fight against capitalism. And of course, you have the fight against police militarization or the fight for abolition. YOUSEF: That last concern about how this massive campus might further militarize police has felt salient to many in the movement. In January, a Georgia state patrol officer killed an activist named Manuel Teran while clearing an encampment of Cop City protesters. Police claimed Teran had shot and injured an officer. But autopsy results from the DeKalb County medical examiner's office have called that into question. (SOUNDBITE OF MACHINE WHIRRING) YOUSEF: This past Saturday, activists gathered again to kick off a week of action against Cop City. As kids played on a bouncy house and people made protest art, the police cruisers in the area were conspicuous. That evening, uniformed officers appeared in the park. A couple dozen assembled in a line. And there was briefly a stunned silence as they walked toward the protesters. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER: Just a friendly reminder to let everybody know that the park will be closing at 11 o'clock. And everything has to be removed from the park at that time. YOUSEF: But many said it didn't feel friendly. The police had been circling in their vehicles all day. And the very moment they appeared in the park was just when the vigil was starting for slain activist Manuel Teran, known to them as Tortuguita. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #1: Murderers. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER: Don't worry, folks. It's all under control. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #2: Murderers. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER: I'm with them. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: Viva, viva Tortuguita. Viva, viva Tortuguita. YOUSEF: Atlanta has a history of activists whose ideas challenge the authority of the state. And as police tensely walked the length of the park surrounded by angry demonstrators, Keyanna Jones summoned some of that history. KEYANNA JONES: (Singing) Ain't going to let nobody turn us around, turn us around, turn us around. Ain't going to let nobody. Dr. King was labeled an outside agitator at some point. And he's born right here in the city of Atlanta, just like I am. YOUSEF: Jones says Republican leaders in Georgia are invoking the same language now, describing demonstrators as outside agitators. But she says it's inaccurate. She herself lived right next to the training facility site and had to move away because the police were already using it for target training. The constant gunfire created chronic stress for her 8-year-old son. But Attorney General Chris Carr has leaned hard on the outside agitator narrative. Here he is in an interview on Atlanta TV station WANF. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHRIS CARR: If you come to this state, engage in acts of violence to destroy infrastructure and property with the intended effect of changing public policy, it is a domestic terrorism charge. YOUSEF: But Lauren Regan of the Civil Liberties Defense Center says many states have terrorism statutes, and they can be misused. LAUREN REGAN: They claim that they're passing these types of laws to deal with mass shooting and, like, mass murder of civilian populations. But yet legislators are using it as a cudgel against political activists and against people who dissent against state power. YOUSEF: There may be signs that the prosecution is now struggling with how to charge Cop City defendants. So far, none of the 42 accused of domestic terrorism has been indicted. And late last week, one of the two offices prosecuting them abruptly recused itself from the case. One of the defendants is challenging the constitutionality of Georgia's domestic terrorism statute. Meanwhile, opponents of Cop City see one last legal avenue to stop the project. They're gathering signatures for a referendum that could potentially stop the plan altogether. Odette Yousef, NPR News.

YOUSEF: But Lauren Regan of the Civil Liberties Defense Center says many states have terrorism statutes, and they can be misused. LAUREN REGAN: They claim that they're passing these types of laws to deal with mass shooting and, like, mass murder of civilian populations.

YOUSEF: There may be signs that the prosecution is now struggling with how to charge Cop City defendants. So far, none of the 42 accused of domestic terrorism has been indicted. And late last week, one of the two offices prosecuting them abruptly recused itself from the case. One of the defendants is challenging the constitutionality of Georgia's domestic terrorism statute.

KEYANNA JONES: (Singing) Ain't going to let nobody turn us around, turn us around, turn us around. Ain't going to let nobody. Dr. King was labeled an outside agitator at some point. And he's born right here in the city of Atlanta, just like I am. YOUSEF: Jones says Republican leaders in Georgia are invoking the same language now, describing demonstrators as outside agitators. But she says it's inaccurate. She herself lived right next to the training facility site and had to move away because the police were already using it for target training. The constant gunfire created chronic stress for her 8-year-old son. But Attorney General Chris Carr has leaned hard on the outside agitator narrative. Here he is in an interview on Atlanta TV station WANF. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHRIS CARR: If you come to this state, engage in acts of violence to destroy infrastructure and property with the intended effect of changing public policy, it is a domestic terrorism charge. YOUSEF: But Lauren Regan of the Civil Liberties Defense Center says many states have terrorism statutes, and they can be misused. LAUREN REGAN: They claim that they're passing these types of laws to deal with mass shooting and, like, mass murder of civilian populations. But yet legislators are using it as a cudgel against political activists and against people who dissent against state power. YOUSEF: There may be signs that the prosecution is now struggling with how to charge Cop City defendants. So far, none of the 42 accused of domestic terrorism has been indicted. And late last week, one of the two offices prosecuting them abruptly recused itself from the case. One of the defendants is challenging the constitutionality of Georgia's domestic terrorism statute. Meanwhile, opponents of Cop City see one last legal avenue to stop the project. They're gathering signatures for a referendum that could potentially stop the plan altogether. Odette Yousef, NPR News.

      "text": "Controversy surrounding the construction of 'Cop City' in Georgia won't let up\n\nFrom\n\nBy\n\nA Martínez\n\n,\n\nChamian Cruz\n\nProtests continue over a police training facility near Atlanta - as construction is already underway, and a petition to get voters to weigh in is stalled in court.\n\nA MARTÍNEZ, HOST: In Atlanta, a new police training facility is being built on 85 acres of wooded land. Protesters have long railed against the plan. More than 60 people have been arrested this year during protests. Some have been violent. And some protesters are now charged with racketeering. Some are also facing domestic terrorism and money laundering charges. Atlanta's mayor and Georgia's governor still support the training facility, and a petition to put the training center's funding on the ballot is stalled in court. We're joined now by Chamian Cruz of WABE in Atlanta, who's been following this story. So what exactly do the protesters want, and why? CHAMIAN CRUZ, BYLINE: Well, A, for more than two years now, protesters - and that includes environmentalists and anti-police groups - they've been saying that they fear the state-of-the-art facility will further militarize police from around the country who come to train here. And they say that construction is going to exacerbate environmental damage in this low-income, majority-Black area. So while you have some groups who say that the facility should just be built somewhere else where it isn't in people's backyards and destroying valuable green space in the community, you also have some people who don't want this facility to be built at all. And protests have only intensified, and they gained national attention after state troopers shot and killed a protester at the site in January. And then recently, a special prosecutor announced that he would not be bringing charges against those officers involved. He said that he found their use of deadly force was objectively reasonable. And this comes, as you said earlier, while dozens of protesters are facing racketeering and domestic terrorism charges. So protesters have also been calling on those to be dropped. MARTÍNEZ: Yeah, and despite all this, the mayor of Atlanta, the governor of Georgia, they've still stood behind the project. Why is that? CRUZ: City officials say the training center is needed to improve things like de-escalation training, to boost morale and to recruit and retain more officers. The Atlanta Police Department is still about 500 officers short. And so, quite frankly, they say that they are simply spending too much money right now having to rent other facilities or that they're training in parking lots of old shopping centers or abandoned schools with mold and other problems. The city also already owns this land where the center is being built, and once it's completed, it's supposed to have, like, walking trails for the community and a place for them to keep their horses and canines, as well as a mock city where officers can train on how to conduct raids, which is why protesters call this project Cop City. Just last week, protesters set several cement trucks on fire owned by a company working on the project. But Atlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum said that despite this type of action, the project is still on track to be completed in December of next year. MARTÍNEZ: All right. Saw that organizers delivered 116,000 signatures to City Hall to get a rare ballot measure started that would ask Atlanta voters to weigh in on whether they want the facility. Where does that stand? CRUZ: Well, yes, they submitted the signatures to City Hall in late September, but they've just been sitting there ever since because, almost immediately, city officials refused to begin verifying them until a judge rules on whether they're even valid. So there's a court hearing scheduled for next month, where we should find out more. MARTÍNEZ: That's Chamian Cruz with WABE. Thanks a lot. CRUZ: Thank you. Copyright © 2023 NPR.

Protesters have long railed against the plan. More than 60 people have been arrested this year during protests. Some have been violent. And some protesters are now charged with racketeering. Some are also facing domestic terrorism and money laundering charges. Atlanta's mayor and Georgia's governor still support the training facility, and a petition to put the training center's funding on the ballot is stalled in court. We're joined now by Chamian Cruz of WABE in Atlanta, who's been following this story. So what exactly do the protesters want, and why? CHAMIAN CRUZ, BYLINE: Well, A, for more than two years now, protesters - and that includes environmentalists and anti-police groups - they've been saying that they fear the state-of-the-art facility will further militarize police from around the country who come to train here. And they say that construction is going to exacerbate environmental damage in this low-income, majority-Black area. So while you have some groups who say that the facility should just be built somewhere else where it isn't in people's backyards and destroying valuable green space in the community, you also have some people who don't want this facility to be built at all. And protests have only intensified, and they gained national attention after state troopers shot and killed a protester at the site in January. And then recently, a special prosecutor announced that he would not be bringing charges against those officers involved. He said that he found their use of deadly force was objectively reasonable. And this comes, as you said earlier, while dozens of protesters are facing racketeering and domestic terrorism charges. So protesters have also been calling on those to be dropped. MARTÍNEZ: Yeah, and despite all this, the mayor of Atlanta, the governor of Georgia, they've still stood behind the project. Why is that? CRUZ: City officials say the training center is needed to improve things like de-escalation training, to boost morale and to recruit and retain more officers. The Atlanta Police Department is still about 500 officers short. And so, quite frankly, they say that they are simply spending too much money right now having to rent other facilities or that they're training in parking lots of old shopping centers or abandoned schools with mold and other problems. The city also already owns this land where the center is being built, and once it's completed, it's supposed to have, like, walking trails for the community and a place for them to keep their horses and canines, as well as a mock city where officers can train on how to conduct raids, which is why protesters call this project Cop City.

Oklahoma City Police Department/Facebook/Screenshot by NPR hide caption\n\nAn Oklahoma City police officer is under investigation and on paid leave following the release of body camera footage that shows him slamming an elderly Vietnamese man to the ground during a traffic stop. The man suffered a brain bleed and remains hospitalized after the incident.\n\nThe footage shows the Oct. 27 event that begins with Officer Joseph Gibson explaining to 70-year-old Lich Vu that he was being issued a ticket for an improper U-turn.\n\nThere appears to be a language barrier between the two as they argue over whether Vu would sign the citation. Vu eventually exits the car and the argument continues.\n\nGibson insists that if Vu won't sign the ticket, he'll be taken to jail.\n\n\"I'm ready to go to jail,\" Vu said.\n\nThey continue arguing and Vu appears to tell Gibson to \"shut up\" while tapping the officer's chest with the back of his fingers.\n\nThat prompts Gibson to slam Vu to the ground.\n\nA woman, who had earlier in the video identified herself as Vu's wife, asks Gibson to call an ambulance as the officer continues to put handcuffs on a seemingly unresponsive Vu.\n\nVu's daughter posted to Instagram that her father was frail and already in ailing health before the slamming incident - suffering from bone cancer -and that the force of the shove left Vu with a broken neck.\n\n\"This is not how you treat someone that is 5'3, 115 lbs with bone cancer after a car accident,\" Teresa Vu wrote on Oct. 28, alongside pictures that showed Vu's head bloodied, dented and bruised.\n\n\"Especially if English is their second language,\" she added. \"I will never forget this, especially if my dad cannot recover and passes away.\"\n\nIn an update earlier this month, the daughter shared that Vu was still in the hospital and was on a feeding tube and suffering from memory loss.\n\n\"He's conscious now; he can speak and recognize people. Sometimes he gets frustrated because he can't remember why he's there or how he got there, which is understandable. He can't swallow anything properly because of his neck fracture,\" she wrote on Nov. 6.\n\n\"He still has a little bit of bleeding/blood leftover from his brain bleed,\" she said, adding that he had surgery scheduled for later in the week.\n\nThe Oklahoma City Police Department said in a statement that an internal investigation into the incident began \"immediately\" and that Gibson, a six-year veteran on the force, would be on paid leave until the investigation was completed.\n\nSpeaking to Oklahoma City's News 9 on Wednesday, Police Chief Ron Bacy said there was no timeline on when the investigation would be completed, but that officers were working quickly to reach a conclusion in the matter.\n\n\"I think anyone can acknowledge that the video is disturbing, and we understand the community's concerns,\" he said.\n\n\"As chief of police, my job is to ensure a fair and thorough investigation to provide due process for all involved parties,\" Bacy said, dismissing concerns that it could be unfair to have officers investigating one of their own colleagues.\n\n\"It's going to be forwarded to and reviewed by a prosecuting authority, which is completely independent from the police department, and they will make an assessment on that on their own,\" he said.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "Police Across the U.S. Welcomed Cop Show \"The First 48.\" Then Relationships Soured.\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up for Dispatches , a newsletter that spotlights wrongdoing around the country, to receive our stories in your inbox every week.\n\nWhen the A&E true crime reality television show \"The First 48\" comes to town, the police and sheriff's departments that work with it do not receive financial compensation from the show. The benefits are more intangible: a chance to showcase and celebrate the work of a department's officers, the opportunity to improve their image in the eyes of the public, and some acknowledgement for victims who might be overlooked by the media.\n\nBut the show's two-decade history of filming in cities across the U.S. has also left a complicated trail of problems and municipal regret, as ProPublica has reported . Detectives have admitted that they've acted out scenes as the cameras rolled. Key developments in the investigations have sometimes not been shown or mentioned. Episodes sometimes aired before defendants went to trial, publicly disclosing information that potential jury members and witnesses would normally never hear in court.\n\nWhat's more, many law enforcement and legal experts wonder whether the mere presence of cameras changes how the police behave, twisting the truth for the sole purpose of a more engaging narrative.\n\n\"I don't think that anyone would deny that having a camera when you're doing a ride-along like that affects behavior,\" Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm said in 2010, after a 7-year-old girl was shot and killed during a Detroit police SWAT-style raid \"The First 48\" was filming. \"I think it's not a good practice.\"\n\nControversies like the one in Detroit have prompted at least a half dozen cities to cancel their contracts or end their relationships with \"The First 48.\"  Dallas; Memphis, Tennessee; Mobile, Alabama; Minneapolis; and New Orleans, as well as other cities, have stopped working with the show, with some municipal officials heaping criticism on the program as they severed ties with it.\n\nThe show has not been found to have engaged in any misconduct.\n\n\"I don't want an investigator spending even a minute essentially working for the camera instead of elements of the case,\" Miami police Chief Jorge Colina said in 2018, five years after the city ended its relationship with the program. \"It's not worth the tradeoff.\"\n\nRepresentatives from Kirkstall Road Enterprises, ITV America and ITV, the companies that produce the program, did not respond to requests for comment or to a detailed list of questions. A&E, the television network that airs \"The First 48,\" declined to comment through a spokesperson.\n\nThe show's most recent seasons were filmed in Tulsa, Oklahoma; Gwinnett County, Georgia; and Mobile.\n\nOnce problems arise, these once enthusiastic and mutually beneficial partnerships between the police and reality television can turn into messy breakups. It can also take time for the problems involving \"The First 48\" to come to light, sometimes years after the episodes have aired and only after cases have wound their way through the courts.\n\nHere's how that has played out in three cities.\n\nIn 2022, in a courthouse on Alabama's Gulf Coast, a judge was trying to help defense attorneys determine if there were any fans of \"The First 48\" in the jury pool. The defendant in the case had been featured on an episode of the show that aired before his trial, and attorney Chase Dearman was concerned fans would be predisposed to find his client guilty.\n\n\"It is an extremely popular show, especially in the South,\" Dearman said in an interview.\n\nThe judge instructed the assembled prospective jurors to stand if they were regular viewers of shows like \"60 Minutes,\" \"20/20,\" and \"True Crimes.\" Three jurors, then two, then two jurors again stood, respectively. Then he mentioned \"The First 48.\" Fourteen potential jurors rose to their feet.\n\n\"This is a more popular show. Okay,\" the judge said, according to a transcript of the trial.\n\nDearman said that the show's disclaimer, that \"all suspects shown are presumed innocent until proven guilty,\" is not enough to contend with human biases. \"What do you think those jurors are going to do when they go home at night?\" Dearman said. \"They're going to look it up and watch it.\"\n\nDearman's client was acquitted after two mistrials.\n\nMobile defense attorney Domingo Soto was also concerned when one of his clients was shown on the show before trial. \"The cops decided a version of the truth from the very beginning and sold it to 'First 48' and more importantly sold it to themselves,\" he said.\n\nA spokesperson for the Mobile Police Department declined to comment on its involvement with \"The First 48\" as well as on the cases that involved the men whom Dearman and Soto represented.\n\nIn 2023, the city did not renew its contract with \"The First 48.\" James Barber, a former police chief and former city public safety director in Mobile and now chief of staff to the mayor, said the show helped shine a positive light on the \"dedication and professionalism of our homicide investigators.\"\n\n\"However, our most important focus is always public safety, and we saw that pre-trial coverage of criminal cases had led to litigation and legal challenges in other jurisdictions,\" Barber said in a statement. \"We did not want our work with any media partner to impact any criminal matter or create legal issues for the city.\"\n\nSometimes small narrative touches to \"The First 48\" episodes, perhaps inconsequential to the viewer, have major repercussions in real life. In 2013, a man named Arking Jones was interviewed by Dallas police about the murder of a suspected drug dealer, an investigation captured in the episode \"Safe House.\"\n\nJones told ProPublica that he had no idea he was being taped for the show and did not sign a consent form to appear on the program. He said he only learned he had been on \"The First 48\" after the episode had aired. Despite the show's efforts to hide his identity by blurring his face and altering his voice, Jones said it was obvious to people who knew him that he was in the episode.\n\n\"I start getting all type of threats. They start coming by my mother's house,\" Jones said.\n\nAccording to Jones, the worst part was that the episode was edited in a way to suggest he had become a police informant; Jones denied that he spoke with police voluntarily or that he was an informant. The threats to his life got so bad, he said, that he had to stop working. Court records show that Dallas police filed retaliation charges against several people for allegedly making threats to Jones and his family. Those charges never resulted in convictions, according to Jones.\n\nIn 2015, Jones was shot several times at a barber shop in an attack that also injured a bystander. He was hit in the chest and hip, and he said he now has a metal rod in his thigh. The man who shot Jones pleaded guilty to aggravated assault with a deadly weapon in retaliation and was sentenced to 24 years in prison.\n\nAccording to Dallas police reports, the shooting was motivated by Jones' appearance on \"The First 48.\" Jones filed a lawsuit against Kirkstall Road Enterprises, claiming it acted negligently. In its response, attorneys for the show implied that Jones' criminal history could have been the root cause of the attack and that his \"sole claim of negligence is barred by the First Amendment.\"\n\nA judge dismissed the case and an appeals court upheld that decision.\n\n\"If we were to place the burden to prevent the kind of unforeseeable injury that befell Jones in this case on the media, the result would be a significant infringement on its Constitutional protections when reporting matters of public interest,\" the appeals court wrote.\n\nA&E removed Jones' episode from its catalog. However, in the decade since the shooting, Jones said that his reputation has never recovered. He said he's been attacked and robbed and, last year, his truck was shot up. He sent photos of the truck to a ProPublica reporter.\n\n\"Y'all looking at it just for good TV. You know, you're not caring about innocent lives,\" Jones said of the show. \"My life is in a situation like, I'm dead. That's how I see it. I'm dead. Because I can't live life.\"\n\nThe Dallas Police Department declined to comment. In 2021, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed a bill into law that bans reality television shows from partnering with law enforcement. The law was named after Javier Ambler II, a Texas man who died after a high-speed chase and violent arrest, captured by a camera crew for \"Live PD,\" another A&E police reality series. \"Live PD\" was canceled in 2020.\n\nThe immediate aftermath of one of the worst mass killings in Memphis history was captured by producers for \"The First 48\" for an episode named \"Lester Street.\" On March 3, 2008, police discovered the bodies of four adults and two children in a small brick house. Three other children survived the attack with serious injuries.\n\nThe investigation converged on Jessie Dotson, the brother of one of the victims, who confessed to detectives on camera that he committed the murders after a drunken fight. The episode aired before his trial, a concern District Attorney General Bill Gibbons raised in a letter to the police chief.\n\n\"Several judges have expressed to prosecutors in this office their concern that events of a pending criminal case are edited, taken out of sequence, and then aired nationally,\" Gibbons wrote. \"It is my hope that you will not renew the Memphis Police Department's contract with 'The First 48' - a show that clearly airs potential evidence and information on pending criminal cases.\"\n\nThe judge in the case did not allow the jury to watch edited footage of Dotson's confession on \"The First 48\" because representatives of the show said they had already destroyed the raw footage. Dotson was convicted and sentenced to death. The city of Memphis ended its relationship with \"The First 48\" in 2008.\n\nRead More\n\nBut the show has cast a long shadow over the case. In January 2024, Kelley Henry, a federal public defender representing Dotson, filed an appeal pointing out dozens of issues with the original investigation, among them that Dotson, who has \"neurocognitive disorders,\" was pressured into confessing, though he recanted shortly afterwards. She said that she believes \"The First 48\" influenced detectives to exert that pressure before the FBI was about to take over the case and that Dotson is innocent.\n\nThe Memphis Police Department did not respond to requests for comment. Dotson's appeal is pending.\n\n\"It just really crystallized for me, just how dangerous these folks are and the pressure that they put on the cities and the prosecutors and the police departments to come up with a story,\" Henry said. \"It's not necessarily that they're malevolent, but their objectivity is compromised by the presence of those cameras.\"\n\nMariam Elba contributed research.\n\nFiled under -\n\nI cover criminal justice, housing and the child welfare system in Minnesota and the Midwest.\n\nI focus on issues affecting Minnesota and the greater Midwest, but am always interested in tips about abuse of power from anywhere.

      "text": "\"A Wholly Inaccurate Picture\": Reality Cop Show \"The First 48\" and the Wrongly\n            Convicted Man\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up for Dispatches , a newsletter that spotlights wrongdoing around the country, to receive our stories in your inbox every week.\n\nThese highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.\n\nEleven days after 18-year-old Jesse Mickelson was gunned down in a South Minneapolis alley, homicide detectives returned to the home where Mickelson had been playing football moments before his murder. The detectives had good news to share, so Mickelson's family and friends squeezed around the dining room table to hear it.\n\n\"We have made an arrest,\"\n\n\"Yes,\" someone said. \"Thank you.\"\n\nDale and his partner, Sgt. Christopher Gaiters, told the family they had arrested a suspect, a man witnesses said they saw firing from the back seat of a white Dodge Intrepid as it rolled down the alley. His name was Edgar Barrientos-Quintana, and the police had the 25-year-old in custody.\n\nAs the family members hugged one another and cried, Mickelson's father stuck his hand out to Gaiters, then wrapped the detective in a hug.\n\n\"Thanks a lot, man,\" he said quietly. \"Thanks a lot.\"\n\nThe scene in the grieving family's dining room was captured in October 2008 by cameras for the A&E true crime reality television series \"The First 48.\" The premise of the show, as explained by a deep-voiced narrator, is that homicide detectives' \"chance of solving a murder is cut in half if they don't get a lead within the first 48 hours.\" In each episode of the program, which debuted in 2004 and is currently in its 27th season, camera crews follow along with police as they work to beat a clock that counts down in the corner of the screen.\n\nThe episode, titled \"Drive-By,\" tracked the detectives from the moment Mickelson's family dialed 911 to the arrest of Barrientos-Quintana. Under moody, dark music punctuated by dramatic sound effects, Dale and Gaiters determined that Mickelson, a lanky high school senior with icy blue eyes, was \"a pretty good kid\" and the unintentional victim of a gang-related drive-by shooting. Based on interviews with witnesses, their faces blurred and voices distorted for TV, the detectives pieced together that \"Smokey,\" a nickname for Barrientos-Quintana recorded in a police database, was the shooter.\n\n\"Looks like we have our guy,\"\n\nThe episode aired in April 2009, about a month before Barrientos-Quintana went to trial.\n\nIn court, the case against Barrientos-Quintana that Hennepin County prosecutors presented built on the clean, conclusive narrative of the episode. Witnesses from rival gang cliques testified they either were in the car with Barrientos-Quintana when the crime occurred or saw him shooting at them.\n\nThe prosecutors also told jurors that Barrientos-Quintana's alibi, that he'd been with his girlfriend at a grocery store across town before the murder, still allowed him time to get to the crime scene.\n\nAfter a jury found Barrientos-Quintana guilty, reruns of the episode ended with a title card that read, \"Edgar 'Smokey' Barrientos was subsequently convicted of first-degree murder. He was sentenced to life without parole.\"\n\nSixteen years later, that tidy narrative unraveled. Last year, the Minnesota attorney general's Conviction Review Unit released a 180-page report concluding that Barrientos-Quintana's conviction \"lacks integrity\" and ought to be vacated. In November, Barrientos-Quintana - who always maintained his innocence and was never linked to the crime by any physical evidence - walked out of prison.\n\nAt a press conference led by Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty, who made the decision to dismiss the charges, Barrientos-Quintana shifted back and forth on his feet and smiled nervously, the grey in his beard a notable difference from his appearance in \"The First 48\" episode.\n\n\"Happy to be out here,\" was all that he offered to the reporters asking how he felt. \"It's the best week. And more to come.\" Barrientos-Quintana, through his lawyers, declined an interview request.\n\nThe Conviction Review Unit report that ultimately convinced both Moriarty's office and a judge that Barrientos-Quintana should be freed outlined dozens of issues with the investigation and trial, many of them hallmarks of wrongful convictions. Long, coercive interrogations. Improper use of lineup photos.\n\nBoth the report and the judge's order also highlighted one unique issue: the role of \"The First 48.\"\n\n\"In the episode, events happened out of order, and Sgts. Dale and Gaiters staged scenes for the producers that were not a part of the investigation,\" wrote Judge John R. McBride. \"What is more, the episode failed to include other, actual portions of the investigation, painting a wholly inaccurate picture of how the MPD investigation unfolded.\"\n\nConviction Review Unit attorneys concluded that police and prosecutors became locked into a narrative they did not deviate from. In essence, the unit alleged, instead of the case shaping the show, the show shaped the case.\n\n\"They said, 'We got the right guy. We got him,' before they knew or really looked into the existence of Edgar's alibi,\" said Anna McGinn, an attorney for the Great North Innocence Project who represented Barrientos-Quintana. \"It's on TV. I mean, that's problematic.\"\n\nBarrientos-Quintana's exoneration may be the first in the country related to the \"The First 48,\" but it is not the first time the program has found itself embroiled in controversy, though not necessarily because of its conduct. In 2010, for instance, \"The First 48\" was filming when a Detroit police SWAT-style team raided an apartment and an officer shot and killed 7-year-old Aiyana Stanley-Jones. In Miami, a man featured on the show as the prime suspect in a 2009 double murder sat in jail for 19 months before the police finally determined he wasn't responsible. In both cases, subsequent lawsuits accused the police of shoddy investigations and hasty decision-making in the service of creating good TV. Both cases ended in settlements - $8.25 million in Detroit - paid out by the cities, not \"The First 48.\"\n\n\"No one cared that my boy was killed, and the cops just rushed it for a damn show,\" the father of one of the double murder victims told the Miami New Times .\n\nProsecutors, judges, defense attorneys and city officials across the country have bemoaned their police departments' decision to allow the show into active crime scenes to film officers investigating sensitive homicide cases. It's even been raised as an issue by an attorney who represents a death row inmate in Tennessee.\n\n\"I wish that the city would never contract with 'The First 48,'\" remarked one New Orleans judge in 2015 after the show was accused by defense lawyers of lying about deleting raw footage of a triple murder investigation. \"I hope in the future they would think through that.\"\n\n\"The First 48,\" like similar programs such as \"Cops\" and \"Live PD,\" is sometimes derided as \"copaganda,\" pro-law-enforcement entertainment that poses as documentary. But it's popular enough that A&E frequently programs hours of reruns back to back. Fans discuss favorite episodes on a busy, dedicated Reddit channel.\n\nWhile other police reality shows have also received negative attention and have been canceled  after high-profile incidents, \"The First 48\" has largely avoided broader public scrutiny. Over the past two decades, the cities of Memphis, Tennessee; New Orleans; Detroit; and Miami have ended their relationships with \"The First 48\" after the show's presence snarled prosecutions or otherwise created problems.\n\nThose severed partnerships seem to have done little to slow production of the show. Kirkstall Road Enterprises, the subsidiary of ITV that produces the show, simply moved on; the most recently released episodes were filmed in Tulsa, Oklahoma; Gwinnett County, Georgia; and Mobile, Alabama, although Mobile did not renew its contract in 2023 after complaints from defense attorneys.\n\nNeither ITV nor ITV America responded to numerous requests for comment or to a detailed list of questions. A spokesperson for A&E Network declined to comment.\n\nMoriarty was Minnesota's chief public defender the last time she tangled with \"The First 48\" on behalf of clients in 2016, and she is still dealing with fallout from the show in her first term as Hennepin County attorney.\n\n\"They are allowed to continue to do probably a great deal of damage without being discovered, without really having any consequences,\" said Moriarty. \"Hopefully, places where this is happening, the city, city council, mayor, whatever, could put a stop to it, and cities where it isn't happening, they could be prepared when 'First 48' comes to their town.\"\n\nWhen Assistant Attorney General Carrie Sperling, the director of the Minnesota Conviction Review Unit, began her reinvestigation of the Barrientos-Quintana conviction, one of the first things she did was watch the episode of \"The First 48\" that featured his case. She was immediately alarmed.\n\n\"It's a false narrative,\" she said. \"Investigators are just misrepresenting details about the case on TV.\"\n\nBarrientos-Quintana began reaching out for help with his conviction almost as soon as he got to prison. In 2011, he became one of a handful of inmates whose cases were accepted for review by the Great North Innocence Project, a nonprofit that investigates possible wrongful convictions in Minnesota and the Dakotas.\n\nBut his appeals went nowhere and, according to McGinn, the case was essentially dormant until the Minnesota attorney general's office launched its Conviction Review Unit in 2021. Because the unit operates within a state law enforcement agency, its investigators had access to material Barrientos-Quintana's lawyers said they never saw.\n\nSperling wanted to understand why detectives zeroed in on Barrientos-Quintana and left other potential suspects to the side. In Gaiters and Dale's theory of the crime, Barrientos-Quintana was a member of the Sureños 13 gang and had recently gotten into a fight with a member of a rival clique called South Side Raza. The leader of that clique, nicknamed Puppet, lived across the alley from Mickelson's house and may also have been seeing the same girl as Barrientos-Quintana.\n\nEarly on in the investigation, a student at Mickelson's high school told police she'd heard that the shooter was named \"either Smokey or Sharky.\" Dale and Gaiters identified a 16-year-old boy known as Sharky, but for reasons the Conviction Review Unit report said are \"not clear,\" detectives decided that Sharky was an accomplice, while Barrientos-Quintana, or Smokey, was the shooter.\n\nIn the course of listening to hours of Gaiters and Dale's original interviews with witnesses, Sperling was struck by how differently \"The First 48\" portrayed those conversations. According to the Conviction Review Unit report, about a half-dozen witnesses, some of them Mickelson's friends and family and some from Puppet's side of the alley, all agreed on one thing: The shooter was bald, \"shiny bald\" even. That fact is never mentioned in the episode, and footage of Barrientos-Quintana's arrest and interrogation shows him with a full head of black hair.\n\n\"They show the video footage of Edgar being arrested at work, and he's clearly not bald,\" said McGinn. \"That is an intentional omission, I believe, and that's very misleading.\"\n\nAt the time Mickelson was shot and killed, Barrientos-Quintana had an arrest record and had convictions for driving offenses and misdemeanor property damage, according to court records. He'd been affiliated with the Sureños 13 gang, but he told detectives he'd left that life behind and was working at a computer warehouse.\n\nMore importantly, perhaps, he told police he was with his girlfriend in a suburb on the other side of town the day of the shooting. In \"The First 48,\" Dale makes a phone call to a \"family friend\" of Barrientos-Quintana's, a conversation that Dale implies has blown the alibi apart, leaving a four-hour window when Barrientos-Quintana could have committed the murder.\n\n\"It's not looking so good for Smokey,\"\n\nIn reality, the 15-year-old girl Barrientos-Quintana was with on the day of the shooting was being questioned at the same time in a separate room. She told detectives repeatedly that Barrientos-Quintana had been with her the whole day at her home. When investigators suggested the pair couldn't have spent the entire day indoors, the girl offered that at one point they'd left to go to the grocery store but had come straight back.\n\nToward the end of the episode, a distraught Barrientos-Quintana tells Dale, \"Right now, I just want to get myself a lawyer.\" In the episode, the interrogation stops, as if Barrientos-Quintana's constitutional right to an attorney was immediately honored. But according to the Conviction Review Unit report, Gaiters and Dale ignored his requests for a lawyer and, at one point, a third officer told Barrientos-Quintana that the detectives would not listen to him if he kept asking for representation.\n\n\"The First 48\" cameras were long gone when, months later, Gaiters and Dale obtained security camera footage of Barrientos-Quintana and the girl at the grocery store. The footage shows the pair together, smiling and walking toward the store's exit, just before 6:20 p.m. The shooting took place roughly 33 minutes later and about 14 miles away, creating a narrow window of time for Barrientos-Quintana to part ways with the girl, change clothes and meet up with his supposed accomplices before witnesses first spotted the Dodge Intrepid behind the Mickelson home.\n\n\"The First 48\" episode about the case aired about two months after this new piece of evidence came to light. There is no mention of it in the program.\n\nThe security footage was far from prosecutors' only challenge heading into the May 2009 trial. In preparation, according to the Conviction Review Unit report, prosecutors Susan Crumb and Hilary Caligiuri learned that Dale had been \"playacting for a reality TV crew\" and the defense might be able to use that revelation to undermine the testimony of Dale or Gaiters.\n\nIn addition, prosecutors told their supervisors in a memo that the show had edited footage of the investigation out of chronological order, generating an inaccurate depiction of what happened. As a result, only Gaiters testified.\n\nBecause the episode aired before trial and a key witness watched it, Crumb and Caligiuri scuttled plans to ask him to identify Barrientos-Quintana in court. All of this was revealed in the memo Caligiuri and Crumb wrote to their supervisors immediately following the trial to express their concerns about the city working with \"The First 48,\" the contents of which were never shared with Barrientos-Quintana's defense attorneys.\n\nCaligiuri, who is now a judge, is precluded from speaking to the press by the Minnesota Code of Judicial Conduct, according to a court spokesperson. Crumb, in an email response to questions from ProPublica, took issue with many of the characterizations in the Conviction Review Unit report but agreed that \"The First 48\" had been a problem.\n\nShe said the producers' scripting for Dale was \"innocuous\" but could have caused problems for prosecutors in cross-examination. And she said a young witness became so afraid after seeing clips of the episode that he ran away from home and, even after police arrested him, refused to testify for prosecutors.\n\n\"Contrary to the CRU's assertion, Barrientos-Quintana was not wrongfully convicted, as the Minnesota Supreme Court confirmed and as an unbiased review of the file and trial record would confirm,\" Crumb, who is retired, said in the email.\n\n\"The filming of the First 48 created problems the defense used to try to sow doubt regarding the Defendant's guilt,\" she added. \"If there was any 'hindrance to the administration of justice' in this case, it was only to the detriment of the prosecution, not the defense.\"\n\nAt trial, Gaiters testified that when he re-created the route from the grocery store to the crime scene, it took 28 minutes, enough time for Barrientos-Quintana to commit the shooting with just minutes to spare. But that did not account for how the girl he was with got home, nor did it square with the claim by Sharky, who was by now one of the prosecution's chief witnesses, that after he met up with Barrientos-Quintana in a park near Mickelson's home, they \"cruised around,\" adding several minutes to the timeline. A private investigator hired by the defense testified that his re-creation of the route took him 33 minutes.\n\nThe man identified as Sharky could not be reached for comment.\n\nDale, who retired from the Minneapolis Police Department in 2023, declined to comment. Gaiters rose through the ranks of the department to become assistant chief of community trust. Through a department spokesperson, Gaiters declined to comment.\n\nThe Police Department did not respond to a detailed list of questions other than to confirm that it ended its relationship with \"The First 48\" in 2016. But ahead of Barrientos-Quintana's release, Chief Brian O'Hara said publicly he supported Dale and Gaiters' original investigation and was \"concerned that a convicted killer will be set free based only upon a reinterpretation of old evidence rather than the existence of any new facts.\"\n\nThe jury struggled to come to a verdict, at one point close to deadlocking with three members unwilling to convict, according to the Conviction Review Unit report. But after being allowed to review Sharky's testimony, they found Barrientos-Quintana guilty. He was sentenced to life without parole.\n\nIn his order vacating the conviction, McBride wrote that the \"colossal failures\" and \"ineptitude\" of Barrientos-Quintana's original lawyers were - on their own - grounds for a new trial. The Conviction Review Unit report also criticized his lawyers, saying they repeatedly failed to challenge many aspects of the prosecution's case as well as Gaiters' testimony.\n\nMessages left for Barrientos-Quintana's four pretrial and trial attorneys were not returned. According to the Conviction Review Unit report, in the years following the trial, one of the lawyers was disbarred, a second had his law license suspended for unethical behavior and a third, who dropped out of the case just before trial, was convicted of swindling a client. The fourth lawyer, the report said, has a clean disciplinary record but had passed the Minnesota bar just a month before trial.\n\nAccording to McGinn, being featured on \"The First 48\" gave Barrientos-Quintana an added - and unwelcome - notoriety in prison. She said that although he is now free, he is distraught that, until recently, \"The First 48\" episode was still available in reruns on A&E and other channels, and was available for streaming.\n\n\"There's been no statement that says, 'Hey, we retract this,' or 'This is an inaccurate depiction of what actually happened that night that Jesse was killed,'\" said McGinn.\n\nA&E said last week that the episode is not currently available.\n\nKirkstall Road Enterprises, which was once known as Granada Entertainment USA and Granada America, enters into agreements with police departments sometimes without the knowledge or approval of other departments in city government. That's one reason prosecutors and other officials have felt blindsided by the problems \"The First 48\" has caused them.\n\nAfter 7-year-old Stanley-Jones was shot and killed by police in 2010 as \"The First 48\" cameras rolled, then-Detroit Mayor Dave Bing said he was shocked to find out that his chief of police had agreed to embed a reality television crew with officers.\n\n\"That's the end of that,\" he reportedly told the chief before banning the practice.\n\nMinneapolis police signed agreements to allow the program to film from 2007 to 2009 and then signed a new deal with the program in 2014. But the city ended its relationship with the show two years later, after legal fighting over the show's raw footage delayed court proceedings and then-Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman slammed the program.\n\n\"'The First 48' is an entertainment device. It's not a device seeking truth or justice,\" Freeman said at the time . \"It gets in the way of us doing our job, the defense doing their job. We wish the police would never have signed up for this.\"\n\nFreeman, since retired, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nCopies of contracts between police departments and Kirkstall Road Enterprises reviewed by ProPublica give producers broad access to investigations so long as they do not interfere with officers' work. They also have creative control over the final product, though departments are allowed to review an episode before it airs. Police departments can request changes, but producers are not obligated to make them.\n\nThe contracts also show that Kirkstall Road Enterprises does not provide departments with any monetary compensation. Before ending its relationship with the show after nine years, the chief of the Miami police requested that the production company donate $10,000 for every Miami episode to the department's charitable youth athletic league in order to continue filming. The show did not accept those terms.\n\nThere are benefits to law enforcement, like positive publicity and recruitment potential. Alabama police officials in Birmingham and Mobile said they believed the show helped them solve more murders.\n\nAfter New Orleans ended its contract with the show, the head of the police union, the Police Association of New Orleans, told a reporter , \"At a time when community relations are so fragile, locally and nationally, it was of enormous benefit to everyone to have an avenue open for the public to see what we do and how we do it.\"\n\nAlthough the New Orleans police ended their relationship with \"The First 48\" in 2016, they're now participating in a new A&E program called \"Homicide Squad New Orleans,\" which began airing episodes this year.\n\nOfficers featured on \"The First 48\" also sometimes enjoy a degree of local celebrity. One Dallas detective became so well known that a suspect recognized him as soon as he walked into an interrogation room. A detective in Memphis, according to court filings, carried photos of herself to sign for fans of the program. Fan accounts on Instagram wish their favorite detectives happy birthday and track their promotions.\n\nThe biggest issue with the show for defense attorneys and prosecutors is access to the raw footage, especially in the days before body-worn cameras - footage that may not make the ultimate \"The First 48\" episode but could capture important conversations and some of the earliest images of the crime scene.\n\n\"It's incredibly important for prosecutors and defense lawyers to have video of anything that pertains to the scene or witnesses,\" said Moriarty.\n\nBut according to court documents, Kirkstall Road Enterprises instructs all of its field producers - employees \"who act as producer, cameraman and sound technician all rolled into one,\" according to an affidavit provided by the show's senior executive producer - never to share raw footage with law enforcement. It is also the show's practice to decline all subpoenas for footage using First Amendment arguments, citing state shield laws that protect journalists from turning over their reporting material. Prosecutors and defense lawyers have struggled to convince judges that the needs of the state or the defendants override those protections. The show also claims it is routine practice to destroy all raw footage after a completed episode is delivered to A&E.\n\nBut reporters and others say it's important to protect their work from being seized by police and prosecutors, as well as to maintain their credibility and independence. In short, they don't want to become, or even be seen as, arms of government. But Moriarty said she believes that, by embedding with police during an active investigation, \"The First 48\" occupies a gray area.\n\nIn 2016, when Freeman, the former Hennepin county attorney, was trying to get footage from \"The First 48\" in ongoing cases, he said that he found the show's refusal to provide it problematic.\n\n\"If 'The First 48' tries to pull the mantle of the First Amendment around this and be sanctimonious - you know something, defendants have rights,\" he said at the time. \"And people want the truth.\"\n\nLater that year, the contract between \"The First 48\" and the city of Minneapolis expired and was not renewed. A spokesperson for the Minneapolis Police Department confirmed the end of the relationship and added that \"MPD has transitioned away from formal contractual agreements with media partners and now engages with them on a case-by-case basis.\"\n\nLooking back on the \"The First 48\" episode now, the Conviction Review Unit's Sperling said one part bothers her most: the oddly performative scene with Mickelson's family jammed around the dining room table with Gaiters and Dale.\n\nTina Rosebear, Mickelson's 44-year-old half-sister, was present the night of the detectives' visit, though she barely registered that a camera crew was filming; she was still in shock over the murder.\n\nRead More\n\nRosebear, a personal care assistant and gas station clerk, took on a lot of responsibility in her family at an early age. She was more than an older sister to Mickelson, becoming his primary caregiver when he was 8 years old.\n\n\"I know that's your son,\" she remembers telling their mother when Mickelson died, \"but that's my baby.\"\n\nBefore \"The First 48\" became more widely available, Rosebear kept multiple copies of the episode on DVD, labeled in Sharpie with the date of his death. She's watched the episode dozens of times. Although she acknowledges some might find it strange, she said she gets a sense of comfort seeing the blurred shots of her brother's body - the footage captured one of the last times she saw him in his \"human form,\" as she puts it, before he was zipped in a body bag and later reduced to the box of ashes she keeps on her bookshelf.\n\nBut Rosebear said it only took until Page 40 of the Conviction Review Unit report for her to realize that she and her family had been misled by the police - and also by \"The First 48.\"\n\n\"I feel like it was all done for the TV show,\" she said. \"But that was unfair to him, and that was unfair to us.\"\n\nRosebear attended the press conference announcing Barrientos-Quintana's release. She'd seen him in court at his trial, but that was their first real meeting. She apologized to him on behalf of her family and gave him a hug.\n\n\"He gets to be with his family now, and now we can try to continue to heal with the loss of my brother now that everything was just ripped back open,\" she told reporters.\n\nThe Conviction Review Unit report not only cleared Barrientos-Quintana, but it contained information that could theoretically point to the real gunman. But Rosebear isn't sure she could handle going through the whole process again - another arrest, another trial.\n\nOnce a fan of \"The First 48,\" Rosebear said she now hopes that the program is shut down.\n\n\"Could they have did a better job if the TV show wasn't involved? Probably,\" she said. \"Nobody knows now. Because it's too late.\"\n\nMariam Elba contributed research.

      "text": "ProPublica logo\n\nJohn Timoney, beat cop with a master's degree, led police departments in New York, Philadelphia and Miami.\n\nby Joe Sexton\n\nIn the 1990s, cop reporting was not a strength of the New York Times, and I'd often get calls from the Metro desk asking if I could help match something or other that had been in the tabs. I was Irish and Catholic and had grown up in Brooklyn along with other kids who wound up \"on the job.\" Oh, and I was an ex-sportswriter, too. I guess I had the pedigree of a cop reporter, if not any demonstrated talent.\n\nI got a call at home one night in March of 1996. Earlier that day, John Timoney, the outgoing first deputy commissioner of the New York Police Department, had been given a hero's reception during a promotion ceremony at Police Headquarters. It amounted to an act of collective insubordination, for Timoney was exiting the department after having been passed over by Mayor Rudy Giuliani to succeed Bill Bratton as commissioner.\n\nThe Times, I guess, hadn't had anyone at the ceremony, and now we needed to catch up. No one had a number for Timoney, and the next edition closed in 40 minutes. It so happened that I'd once been introduced to Timoney, by Mike McAlary of the Daily News (Irish, Catholic, a former sportswriter, and a great cop reporter). I managed to track down Timoney's home number.\n\nTimoney took my call. He was great, and, miracle of miracles, he was on the record. Timoney had been born in Dublin and raised in Northern Manhattan, his dad a New York City doorman. He'd been a beat cop, but had also earned master's degrees in American history and urban planning. He was a reader of literature and an expert in police shootings. He'd been the youngest four-star chief in the history of the department.\n\n\"Plans? I have none,\" Timoney said that night. \"I hope I have left some bridges unburned.\"\n\nCops don't get a lot of good press. Ever. Certainly not lately. Timoney, who died Tuesday night at the age of 68, after a brief, brutal fight with cancer, actually got his fair share. Mostly on the merits. After leaving New York City, he served as the top cop in Philadelphia and Miami. He took heat for his handling of the Republican Convention in 2000, and he got credit for radically reducing police shootings in Miami. He wrote a book or two, taught at Harvard, and most recently drew criticism for agreeing to work for the government of Bahrain, training its security forces. Human-rights advocates accused Timoney of siding with the oppressors; Timoney, at the time, told National Public Radio that he wouldn't have been in Bahrain if he wasn't convinced \"that these folks are serious about reform.\"\n\nBut Timoney never made it back to the NYPD He watched Ray Kelly, Irish Catholic son of a milkman, run the department for 12 years. He respected Kelly, and recognized the magnitude of the challenge New York's police commissioner faced - fighting terrorism while under pressure to cut crime to newly historic lows year after year. He never criticized Kelly, but he had to have measured his own past promise against Kelly's accomplishments and shortcomings.\n\nI don't know if Timoney would have been a great commissioner. He could be stubborn, vain, hotheaded. But I think he would have made the department more human, a quality needed in times like these. Kelly - capable, smart, devoted - grew imperious and all-controlling over the years. He didn't just stifle dissent, he choked off the voices of his own cops. And they had a ton of good stories to tell - of success and diversity and valor. Kelly's cops didn't take calls from reporters.\n\nTimoney was a rower - he liked to get out on the Schuylkill River in the early morning, before heading to Police Headquarters in Philadelphia - and he sent me a link the other day to the video clips of the hilarious Irish silver-medal rowers in Rio. He was a marathoner, too, and was a fan of my uncle, George Sheehan, one of the early evangelists of what was once called the running movement. Earlier this year, I included something my uncle once said in an email to Timoney, who was beginning chemotherapy treatment.\n\n\"The runner is not in a game; he is in a contest. When you race, you are under oath. When you race, you are testifying as to who you are.\"\n\nJohn Timoney was a good cop. No small thing in America, in 2016.\n\nJoe Sexton\n\nJoe Sexton was a senior editor at ProPublica. Before coming to ProPublica in 2013, he had worked for 25 years as a reporter and editor at The New York Times.\n\nGet our investigations delivered to your inbox with the Big Story newsletter.\n\nCreative Commons License (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0)\n\nThank you for your interest in republishing this story.

      "text": "This Cop Got Out of 44 Tickets by Saying Over and Over That His Girlfriend Stole His Car\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up for Dispatches , a newsletter that spotlights wrongdoing around the country, to receive our stories in your inbox every week. This story was co-published with the Chicago Tribune .\n\nEach time he stood before a Chicago traffic court judge and told his story, the judge asked his name.\n\n\"Jeffrey Kriv,\" he'd say. That was true.\n\nThen he'd raise his right hand and get sworn in. What came next was also consistent.\n\n\"Well, that morning, I broke up with my girlfriend and she stole my car,\" Kriv, who had been ticketed for running a red light, testified in January 2021.\n\n\"Yeah, I broke up with my girlfriend earlier that morning, had a knock-down, drag-out fight, verbally, of course. She took my car without my knowledge,\" he told a different judge when fighting a speeding ticket in August 2021.\n\n\"I broke up with my girlfriend that day and she took my car without my knowledge. ... I didn't get my car back for like three days. But it was her driving the car,\" he said while contesting a speeding ticket, once again under oath, in May 2022.\n\nThe excuse worked, just as it had many times before.\n\nAt the ticket hearings, Kriv often provided what he said were legitimate police incident reports as evidence of the car thefts; they had officer names and badge numbers, and he explained that he got the reports at police headquarters.\n\nBut Kriv did not let on that he, himself, was a Chicago cop.\n\nAs bold as he was when fighting his tickets, he was equally brazen in his professional life. He attracted a remarkable number of complaints from citizens he encountered - and even from other officers. And just as he did in his personal life, he defended himself vigorously against the allegations.\n\nKriv doesn't register as one of Chicago's most notorious corrupt cops - those who tortured suspects for confessions or shook down drug dealers. But his on-duty conduct regularly flouted rules and disrupted lives. Once, he punched a handcuffed man in the back of his patrol car, records show.\n\nBut given Chicago's long-standing and dramatic shortcomings in police discipline, none of his on-duty misconduct cost him his badge and gun.\n\nIt took a tip to an outside agency and questions about Kriv's testimony as a private citizen in traffic court to unravel his career.\n\nA spokesperson for the Chicago Police Department would not comment for this story or answer any questions.\n\nA lawyer for Kriv, informed of the reporting by ProPublica and the Chicago Tribune, said \"many of the facts you compose are incomplete or not true,\" though he did not say what was inaccurate. The lawyer, Tim Grace, said that Kriv had received nearly 150 commendations and recognitions and had earned two awards for saving lives.\n\n\"Officer Kriv has served his city with honor for over 25-plus years,\" Grace said.\n\nListen to Former Chicago Police Officer Jeffrey Kriv Try to Avoid Traffic Fines by Repeatedly Claiming His Ex-Girlfriend Stole His Car\n\nKriv used the alibi to get out of paying for 44 traffic tickets since 2013, Cook County prosecutors allege.\n\nIn 1996, Kriv was sworn in as a Chicago police officer. The first complaint about him came about eight months later, while Kriv was still a probationary hire. A man said Kriv broke his car window with a flashlight while directing traffic; Kriv was not disciplined in that incident.\n\nSupervisors reprimanded him a few months later, however, after Kriv failed to notice there was a marijuana cigarette on the back seat of his squad car.\n\nBut there was more to come, records show: being rude, offensive or physically abusive; flipping someone off; and writing in a police report that one woman was \"white trash\" and a \"raving lunatic.\"\n\nHe was held in contempt of court and arrested after he flung papers into the air and called the judge's ruling \"a joke.\" He apologized in court the next day, and the contempt charge was vacated. An assistant deputy superintendent recommended against removing his police powers after the incident, records show. In another case, a different judge ordered him removed from a courtroom after he wouldn't stop talking.\n\nMost officers face only a handful of complaints over the course of their careers. But at least 92 misconduct complaints were filed against Kriv, according to city and police disciplinary records compiled and analyzed by the Chicago Tribune and ProPublica. Even more exceptional: About 28% of complaints against Kriv were found to have merit, compared with about 4% of complaints against all Chicago police officers going back decades.\n\nIn 2005, after a city Streets and Sanitation Department employee towed his illegally parked personal car, Kriv sent a letter via the city's interoffice mail system threatening to ticket the cars of Streets and Sanitation workers in retaliation. He was suspended for 20 days. In 2006, he left the scene of a vehicle fire he had responded to, removed the numbers that identified his squad car and went into a strip club to visit a waitress, according to internal police investigation records. He was issued a 90-day suspension that was later knocked down to 45 days.\n\nIn 2009, Kriv was accused of punching a woman whom he'd arrested after seeing her arguing with her husband on the street. The woman was found not guilty at trial on charges of domestic battery and resisting arrest.\n\n\"I had to have surgery. I had to have plastic implanted under my eye because of this,\" said Jessie Wangeman, who lives in Indianapolis. \"My face is not symmetrical anymore. He really messed me up on the outside. And inside it was a really traumatic experience.\"\n\nWangeman sued Kriv and the city of Chicago over the encounter; the city paid her $100,000 to settle in 2011. Wangeman declined to talk with investigators looking into Kriv's alleged misconduct, and Kriv wasn't disciplined.\n\nMeanwhile, Kriv's personal vehicles - a BMW sedan and a Harley-Davidson motorcycle - were ticketed 22 times between 2008 and 2013. He paid some of those tickets, records show.\n\nAt a traffic court hearing in December 2013, Kriv used the girlfriend alibi for the first time, authorities now allege.\n\n\"May I ask you why you're contesting this ticket, Mr. Kriv?\" the judge asked.\n\n\"Yes, my ex-girlfriend, well, took my car two days prior after I broke up with her. I filed a police report that it was stolen and they recovered it approximately a week after the fact,\" he testified. \"Here's the police report that was done. I did have her arrested approximately three weeks ago and I got a court date coming up in January.\"\n\nThe judge reviewed the report and dismissed the ticket.\n\nKriv was investigated at least 26 times over allegations of dishonesty as a police officer. That included accusations of falsifying records, writing unwarranted tickets, performing improper searches, making false arrests.\n\nOne man accused Kriv of writing him false parking citations. A woman complained that Kriv issued her eight baseless citations in two weeks while her vehicle was parked in an assigned space on private property. And another man made two other complaints accusing Kriv of repeatedly writing tickets to him at his business as a way to harass him. Department investigators concluded that Kriv wrote unwarranted tickets to that man; investigations into the other allegations could not be pursued because the accusers did not sign formal complaints.\n\nAs a cop, Kriv's specialty was DUI enforcement. He made more DUI arrests in Chicago than any other officer in 2021, and he topped the list statewide the same year, according to one anti-drunken-driving group.\n\nBut one woman sued him over her 2015 drunken driving arrest after she was acquitted at trial. The lawsuit alleged that Kriv falsely arrested her and made false statements against her. Kriv denied the allegations.\n\n\"He would lie under oath for a piece of bubble gum,\" the woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation from Kriv, told a reporter.\n\nThe woman later dropped the lawsuit because she said Kriv was disparaging and intimidating her.\n\nEven outside of his job and his chutzpah in traffic court, Kriv's history is notable.\n\nWhile Kriv was growing up in Highland Park, his father, an attorney, funded a messy fraud scheme, survived an assassination attempt meant to silence him about it, and was sent to federal prison for a second fraud racket that involved sending falsified accident claims through the mail, according to court records at the National Archives. Kriv's father testified at trial in the first fraud case and did not face charges for his role in that scheme.\n\nKriv then attended the University of Iowa for six years. A university spokesperson said he never graduated - though he claimed that he had in an application for another city job in 2013 . Kriv's attorney did not respond to a question about his educational history.\n\nWhen Kriv was in his late 20s, the unemployment insurance division of the Illinois attorney general's office sued him to recoup about $3,800 in benefits for which the government claimed he wasn't eligible, records show. Details about what led to the attorney general's claim are missing from court files, and there's no public record of how it was resolved.\n\nNeither the Police Department nor the city's human resources division could locate Kriv's initial application to the Police Department, so it's unclear how much hiring officials knew about his background.\n\nIt's also unclear whether the department knew how often Kriv was being ticketed for traffic violations - nine times in 2014 alone, records show. He got all of those tickets dismissed, including a speeding ticket issued in the fall for going 21 miles an hour over the speed limit near a school.\n\n\"My ex-girlfriend stole my car,\" Kriv told the judge. \"There is this police report over here that was done and, a matter of fact, I had another ticket I contested last week ... another speed camera.\n\n\"They only charged her with trespassing because it was my girlfriend. She stole my key and racked up all these tickets here.\"\n\nThe judge reviewed the report and dismissed the ticket.\n\nKriv's conduct as a cop stands out in yet another way: Even other cops complained about him.\n\nInternal affairs records show that a police lieutenant filed a complaint against Kriv in 2016 accusing Kriv of failing to arrest an off-duty sergeant who was involved in a crash, even though the sergeant was unsteady, was slurring his speech and had urinated in his pants - \"wasted,\" according to a police report. Kriv was suspended for 15 days for violating five department rules in that incident.\n\nHis police partner once reported that he made her get out of their squad car after an argument, forcing her to walk more than a half-mile back to their station. Investigators concluded there wasn't enough evidence in that case to discipline Kriv.\n\nIn 2014, supervisors - including the head of the DUI task force that Kriv was on - filed a complaint against Kriv alleging that he disobeyed commands from a higher-ranking officer and impounded a car without justification after a traffic crash.\n\nOver the other officers' objections, Kriv declared that the driver of the car involved in the crash was drunk, handcuffed him, and put him in the back of his squad car, according to accounts from the driver, Jaime Garcia, and other officers. He also ordered Garcia's Nissan Altima towed and impounded.\n\n\"He kept telling me, 'I know you're drunk, I know you're drunk.' I didn't know what to do, I was in shock, I was scared,\" Garcia said in an interview.\n\nThe officers on the scene filed the complaint against Kriv.\n\n\"For some reason, he was trying to put a false arrest on this guy. I apologized to him, said, 'Sorry you had to go through this.' I told him about filing a complaint,\" said retired Lt. David Blanco, the supervisor that night. After its investigation, the department acknowledged Kriv was wrong to have impounded Garcia's car, knowing there would be no DUI charges against him.\n\nKriv ultimately wasn't disciplined for his behavior that night, once again benefiting from the Police Department's feeble accountability system , which has long been marked by delays, red tape and lax punishment .\n\nThough he regularly escaped punishment altogether for alleged misconduct on the job, in some cases, he was reprimanded or received suspensions of between one and 45 days. The department suspended Kriv at least 20 times for 170 days total, according to a Tribune-ProPublica analysis of his disciplinary records.\n\nOne citizen told the investigating agency that Kriv was unconcerned when he threatened to file a complaint. Kriv, the man said, told him that complaints \"are not going to go anywhere,\" no matter how many an officer was facing. The man's complaint was closed after he declined to participate in the investigation.\n\nKriv appealed disciplinary decisions at least eight times over his career, including through the department's grievance system. A 2017 investigation by the Chicago Tribune and ProPublica found that 85% of disciplinary cases handled through the department's grievance process since 2010 had led to officers receiving shorter suspensions or, in many cases, having their punishments overturned entirely.\n\n\"It doesn't hurt to grieve it. Why wouldn't I?\" Kriv told the Chicago Tribune and ProPublica for that story.\n\nKriv got a five-day suspension reduced to a reprimand, another five-day suspension reduced to two days, and a 90-day suspension - for going to the strip club while on duty - cut in half.\n\n\"It sounds to me like several of these cases - each of them standing on its own, independently - should have triggered a discharge case,\" said Mark Iris, who until 2004 was the executive director of the Chicago Police Board, the civilian body that decides disciplinary cases involving Chicago officers. He also studied the use of mathematical analysis to prevent police misconduct and taught at Northwestern University.\n\n\"The unit commanders had to have known this guy was a headache,\" Iris said in an interview.\n\nRecords show the department never tried to fire Kriv.\n\nBlanco, like many of the people Kriv encountered, said he doesn't get how Kriv remained on the force.\n\n\"That's what I couldn't understand - with all the suspensions, why they didn't get rid of this guy. There's obviously a red light flashing over this guy's head,\" Blanco told ProPublica and the Tribune.\n\nDuring Kriv's career, the Chicago Police Department had eight superintendents, three iterations of an independent police investigation body and at least two versions of an internal affairs division. The Police Department has stalled on at least two attempts to implement an early-warning system to spot problem behavior.\n\nIn its 2019 consent decree with the Justice Department, the Police Department agreed to develop a system to identify officers at risk of misconduct, alert their supervisors and provide training. That system still has not been implemented , according to the latest consent decree update.\n\nIn addition, for most of Kriv's career, the police union's contract with the department allowed investigators to consider only the most recent five years of an officer's disciplinary history. (The current union contract eliminates that requirement). That meant that even officers with extensive histories of misconduct could have looked problem-free when department leaders weighed discipline options.\n\nAs a result, when investigators in 2013 looked into a complaint against Kriv, his recent disciplinary history was clean, so they proceeded as if he'd never been disciplined. The truth was that, by then, he had been suspended or reprimanded for at least 15 different incidents, but the most recent complaints were more than five years old or didn't appear on his record yet because they were still under investigation.\n\nAs Kriv successfully appealed Police Department discipline, he also was successfully beating more and more traffic tickets.\n\nFrom 2015 through mid-2022, Kriv got 51 tickets but paid only two.\n\nOther tickets - issued for reasons including exceeding the speed limit by at least 11 miles an hour, running red lights, blocking an area and parking where he shouldn't - were dismissed.\n\nHe got some tickets dismissed by making technical arguments - claiming a ticket wasn't filled out properly, for example - but most were dismissed after he blamed his girlfriend, records show.\n\nKriv contested tickets using that defense before at least 23 different judges. Sometimes he went before the same judge with the same story, but those appearances were typically years apart.\n\nAt a hearing in 2018, he tried to get out of a speeding ticket issued in a school zone.\n\n\"My girlfriend and I got in an argument that morning,\" he told the judge. \"We broke up. She took my fob and she took my car and I do have a police report.\"\n\n\"I didn't get it back until later that night around 9 o'clock. And I did have her arrested about a week later. We went to her workplace, but here's a copy of the police report.\"\n\nThe judge reviewed the report and dismissed the ticket.\n\nCitywide, it's rare for people to succeed in getting their tickets dismissed. In a typical year, the city issues about 1 million automated-camera tickets for speeding and red-light violations. People contest about 4% of those tickets, and about 1 in 10 win, according to an analysis of city ticket data.\n\nThere's no indication the Police Department knew how often Kriv was contesting his tickets in court. There's also no indication in records that the girlfriend he used as his alibi was real.\n\nLast year, the city's Office of Inspector General received a tip to look at Kriv - not for his work in uniform, but for a potentially fraudulent defense of a parking ticket he had received, records show.\n\nThe OIG followed that tip and concluded that Kriv had provided false testimony and fraudulent documentation related to parking and traffic violations since 2009, according to prosecutors. Since 2013, he had contested 44 tickets by saying his girlfriend had stolen his car. All 44 had been dismissed.\n\nThe office notified the Police Department that it was investigating Kriv.\n\nThe Cook County state's attorney's office in October barred Kriv from testifying in court as a witness, placing him on a list of police officers whose truthfulness is in question . Nonetheless, the police department kept him on the streets and he continued to write tickets and make DUI arrests.\n\nThe final time Kriv took an oath to tell the truth and then blamed his girlfriend for a speeding ticket was in September of 2022, records show. Once again, the story worked.\n\n\"Well, I had her arrested,\" Kriv said when the judge asked what happened to the woman. \"They charged her with a misdemeanor trespassing to a vehicle. That pretty much went nowhere.\n\n\"She got, like, three months' supervision or something like that. It's kind of a, I don't want to say the system's like a joke, but it didn't really do anything.\"\n\nAs Kriv, who is 56, was defending himself in traffic court last year, he also was eyeing retirement, going back and forth with the Policemen's Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago to sort out his pension benefits. He was told he'd gain another year of seniority - and a larger pension - if he stayed on the force until Jan. 15.\n\nOn Jan. 12, the department collected his badge and stripped him of police powers.\n\nOn Jan. 14, Kriv got another speeding ticket.\n\nOn Jan. 17, Kriv retired.\n\nThe next day, Kriv's car was ticketed again for speeding.\n\nOn Jan. 31, Cook County prosecutors charged Kriv with four counts of perjury and five counts of forgery, all of them felonies, for allegedly lying to judges under oath and providing fictitious police reports in four traffic ticket cases.\n\nThe girlfriend story, prosecutors allege, was fake. Prosecutors calculated that, by getting out of 44 tickets, Kriv saved himself $3,665.\n\nThe state's attorney's office declined to comment about its case against Kriv.\n\nKriv emailed the pension board the day after he was charged and released on $10,000 bond, writing: \"When do I start getting my pension checks and does it come bi-weekly or once a month?\" His pension started at about $6,000 a month, according to the board.\n\nDeborah Witzburg, the inspector general whose office helped build the case against Kriv, declined to comment for this story. In a news release about the charges, she said: \"The truthfulness and credibility of police officers is foundational to the fair administration of justice, and to CPD's effectiveness as a law enforcement agency.\"\n\nRead More\n\nGrace, Kriv's attorney, noted that the criminal charges are not related to his duties as a police officer. \"He understands the importance of accountability by all citizens when it comes to paying his outstanding tickets and looks forward to resolving this matter by making good on any oversights he may have,\" Grace said.\n\nIn late March, a Cook County judge called out, \"Jeffrey Kriv,\" and the former officer stepped forward to be arraigned. He pleaded not guilty. Each offense is punishable by up to five years in prison.\n\nWhen reached by phone, Kriv said he didn't want to talk because \"nobody gets a fair shake with the media\" and his attorney had advised him not to say anything.\n\n\"When it is all said and done, this will be dismissed,\" he said. \"There is nothing to it.\"\n\nKriv got three more speeding tickets soon after he retired in mid-January. He didn't contest any of them, and he paid the fines.\n\nThen he got three more speeding tickets.\n\nDo You Have a Tip for ProPublica? Help Us Do Journalism.\n\nGot a story we should hear?

      "text": "Even When a Cop Is Killed With an Illegally Purchased Weapon, the Gun Store's Name Is Kept Secret\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up for Dispatches , a newsletter that spotlights wrongdoing around the country, to receive our stories in your inbox every week.\n\nNearly three years have passed since the 2021 murder of Chicago police officer Ella French, and police and prosecutors have revealed much about her killing: the grim details of her final moments, the type of gun used to shoot her during a traffic stop and how that .22-caliber Glock made its way into the hands of the man who pulled the trigger.\n\nBut absent from the public discussion was the name of the retail shop where the gun used to kill French was purchased. Its disclosure has been hindered by a long-standing push by the gun industry to protect the identities of retailers that have sold guns used in crimes.\n\nThe law enforcement agencies that investigated her murder and prosecuted her killer could not or would not say. Those that tracked and prosecuted the man who bought the gun used to kill her have been just as silent.\n\nProPublica, however, has learned the name of the retailer. It's Deb's Gun Shop, an Indiana retailer just over the Illinois state border that has drawn attention from federal regulators because of the large number of its guns that have turned up in crime investigations. James Vanzant, an attorney for the man convicted on federal charges for buying that gun, revealed that detail in an interview.\n\nSpeaking through his attorney, Deb's Gun Shop owner Ed Estack called French's death a horrible tragedy but declined further comment.\n\nTwo decades ago, federal and local law enforcement routinely identified the source of guns used in crimes to members of the media or anyone else who inquired.\n\nThat changed in 2003 when Congress, bowing to pressure from the gun industry, approved legislation known as the Tiahrt amendment, named after a former Rep. Todd Tiahrt, R-Kan., a gun rights champion. The amendment bars police and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives from disclosing any information they uncover during gun-tracing investigations, including the names of retailers.\n\nThe move hobbled efforts by cities to study gun-trafficking patterns and ended what the gun industry has called a pattern of \"name and shame,\" in which retailers were thrust into the spotlight for selling guns later linked to crimes.\n\nGun safety advocates and researchers argue that Tiarht created a knowledge gap on a pressing public safety issue and allowed retailers to escape scrutiny. Such information, they say, can help the public determine whether the transactions that put guns in the hands of criminals are a rarity or part of a larger pattern.\n\nThe story of the gun used to kill French began in earnest in March 2021 at Deb's, a small storefront off one of the main drags in Hammond, Indiana. Inside, Jamel Danzy picked out the Glock to purchase, then waited to pass his background check. On March 25, he returned and picked up the gun, prepared to deliver it to a friend.\n\nHe later admitted to ATF investigators that he'd bought the gun for Eric Morgan in violation of federal law. Danzy acknowledged that he knew Morgan was barred by federal law from buying a gun for himself due to a prior felony conviction. Morgan drove from Chicago to Danzy's home in Hammond to pick it up.\n\nFour months later, French, 29, was on night patrol in the West Englewood neighborhood when she joined other officers in conducting a traffic stop on a Honda SUV traveling with an expired registration. The officers inspected the car and found Morgan and his brother, Emonte Morgan, inside with a bottle of liquor.\n\nThe encounter escalated as officers ordered the brothers to exit the car, according to Chicago police. Eric Morgan jumped out and fled on foot. His brother stayed, refusing to put down his cup. A scuffle ensued. As French ran to help the other officers at the scene, Emonte Morgan pulled out the Glock and began to fire, police said.\n\nFrench was struck and killed. Another officer, Carlos Yanez Jr., was severely wounded.\n\nCook County prosecutors charged both Morgan brothers in French's killing. Eric Morgan pleaded guilty to aggravated battery and unlawful use of a deadly weapon. In March, a Cook County court convicted Emonte Morgan of French's murder. He has since petitioned for a new trial.\n\nDanzy already was serving time by then. In 2022, he pleaded guilty to charges that he conspired with Morgan to buy the gun and lied by claiming on a required form that he was purchasing it for himself. A judge sentenced him to 30 months in federal prison.\n\nThe ATF, which investigated the purchase of the gun used to kill French, would not reveal the name of the Hammond retailer when contacted by ProPublica. Neither would federal prosecutors. In filings for the case against Danzy, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois did not reveal the name of the store where he purchased the Glock.\n\nTiahrt's restrictions prevent investigators from disclosing the names of gun retailers, but federal prosecutors who try gun traffickers have more leeway. In fact, such disclosures in federal filings occur often.\n\nProPublica has viewed federal filings in both the Northern District of Illinois and the Northern District of Indiana where retailers were named in conjunction with cases against individuals who lied to make gun purchases or later resold the guns illegally in so-called straw sales.\n\nOne such gun was bought from an Indiana retailer and days later used in a shooting that left two Wisconsin police officers severely injured, ProPublica reported in March. The retailer involved was never charged yet still was named in court records.\n\nNonetheless, Joseph Fitzpatrick, a spokesperson for the US Attorney's Office in Chicago, said it's \"our policy to not identify uncharged individuals or entities.\"\n\nAs part of an ongoing lawsuit against the firearms industry , the city of Gary, Indiana, is seeking sales records from Deb's and other retailers in the area. The suit aims to hold responsible local gun retailers and iconic gun manufacturers, such as Smith & Wesson and Glock, associated with illegal purchases like the one that led to French's murder. The suit has survived court challenges for nearly a quarter of a century, but the Indiana General Assembly recently passed a law designed to get it dismissed. Deb's is not a defendant in the suit.\n\nATF records show that Deb's has operated under enhanced monitoring from the agency since at least 2021. The gun shop is included in a program known as Demand 2 for retailers who sell a high volume of guns later recovered in police investigations, according to records obtained by the Brady Center, a gun violence prevention group, and provided to ProPublica.\n\nGun dealers can be placed in Demand 2 when ATF finds they are the source of at least 25 gun-trace requests from police in a given year; the retail sale of those guns must have been three or fewer years prior to that.\n\nBesides the gun bought by Danzy, records show that at least one other firearm purchased illegally at Deb's in recent years was central to a killing.\n\nIn 2021, Mark J. Halliburton shot and killed Monica J. Mills outside a school in East Chicago, Indiana, over a gun illegally purchased at Deb's Gun Range. A prior criminal conviction prevented Halliburton from purchasing a gun legally, so he'd paid Mills $100 to buy the gun for him, according to court records. The two then argued over the deal one night inside a car in the parking lot of a school, leading to the shooting. The gun that fired the fatal shot was the same one purchased at Deb's, according to police records. Halliburton later pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and was sentenced to 17 years in prison.\n\nDavid Sigale, an attorney for Deb's Gun Range owner Estack, declined to comment on Deb's compliance record or associations with guns traced to crimes. \"Deb's continues to cooperate with all requests from law enforcement,\" he said.\n\nThe ATF points out that involvement in the Demand 2 program does not mean a retailer has done anything wrong. Retailers' location and the sheer volume of sales they process can make businesses susceptible to trafficking schemes, the agency told ProPublica in written answers. The program helps \"raise awareness\" among those retailers, ATF said.\n\nAdvocates for the gun industry say retailers in Demand 2 are operating within the law. \"The illegal straw purchase of a firearm is a crime committed by the individual lying on the form. That is not a crime for which the firearm retailer is liable,\" said Mark Oliva, spokesperson for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a lobbying group for gun retailers and manufacturers.\n\nOliva also reiterated the group's continued support of the basic tenets behind the Tiahrt amendment. \"Access to gun-trace data should only be available to law enforcement taking part in a bona fide investigation, and law enforcement already has the access it needs for this purpose,\" he said.\n\nKristina Mastropasqua, an ATF spokesperson, said Tiahrt helps protect the integrity of ongoing agency investigations and \"does not negatively affect ATF's ability to investigate and hold accountable illegal gun purchases or traffickers.\"\n\nBut the debate over Tiahrt continues even as efforts to revisit it in Congress stall.\n\nDr. Garen Wintemute, director of the Violence Prevention Research Program at the University of California-Davis, said that Tiahrt's restrictions have inhibited the study of illicit gun markets. He and others who study gun violence say they need the data to understand gun trafficking and, in turn, assess the regulatory efforts to prevent it.\n\n\"Firearms are associated with a number of adverse health effects,\" he said. \"Wouldn't we like to know where that hazard is coming from?\"\n\nWhen researchers do obtain tracing data compiled by federal authorities, it's usually under an agreement to keep the sources of the guns confidential. But there have been workarounds and exceptions. The city of Chicago and its police department facilitated University of Chicago studies that identified several Midwest retailers as the sources of thousands of guns trafficked into the city and then later submitted to the ATF for tracing.\n\nThe studies - published in 2014 and 2017 - link Westforth Sports , a now-closed Gary, Indiana, retailer, to 850 such guns recovered by police . There was no mention of Deb's Gun Range in either of those reports. Shop owner Earl Westforth did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nRead More\n\nOther cities are continuing to look for ways to navigate around the Tiahrt amendment. The city of Baltimore, for instance, is suing the ATF over its denial of trace data.\n\nThat drew the ire of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which moved to intervene in the case. \"This is a transparent attempt by gun control advocates at the City of Baltimore ... to gain access to the data to use it to smear licensed firearm retailers and manufacturers by suggesting they are responsible for crimes committed by others misusing lawfully sold firearms,\" foundation Senior Vice President Lawrence G. Keane said in a statement.\n\nIn arguing for the gun-trace information to stay under wraps, foundation attorneys cited federal law - specifically the Tiahrt amendment.\n\nFiled under -\n\nI'm a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter based in Chicago who writes about, among other things, law enforcement and veterans' issues.\n\nIf you have a story to tell, I have an ear for you - especially if you can shed light on how policies enacted in Washington are harming people in the Chicago area.

      "text": "A Detective Sabotaged His Own Cases Because He Didn't Like the Prosecutor. The Police Department Did Nothing to Stop Him.\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up for Dispatches , a newsletter that spotlights wrongdoing around the country, to receive our stories in your inbox every week.\n\nThe voicemail left on St. Louis police detective Roger Murphey's cellphone carried a clear sense of urgency.\n\nA prosecutor in the St. Louis circuit attorney's office was pleading with Murphey to testify in a murder trial, the sort of thing the lead detective on a case would routinely do to see an arrest through to conviction. The prosecutor told Murphey that, without his testimony, the suspect could walk free.\n\n\"I wanted to reach out to you one more time,\" Assistant Circuit Attorney Srikant Chigurupati said in a message one afternoon in June 2021. \"I do think we need you on this case.\"\n\nMurphey didn't respond.\n\nProsecutor Reaches Out\n\nThis is a portion of the first voicemail that prosecutor Srikant Chigurupati left for Roger Murphey asking the police detective to testify in a murder trial.\n\nThat evening, Chigurupati left Murphey another voicemail. \"If it makes any difference, this guy's a really bad guy,\" Chigurupati said, according to the message, which Murphey provided for this story. \"What he did was pretty ridiculous. So, I mean, can you put your differences aside and focus on getting this guy?\"\n\nAgain, Murphey didn't respond.\n\nWeeks later, a jury found Brian Vincent not guilty, and he went free. Murphey said he believes his refusal to testify helped scuttle the case - a claim corroborated by at least one juror from the trial.\n\nA number of American cities have elected prosecutors who promised progressive law enforcement, focusing as much on police accountability as being tough on crime. In St. Louis, that prosecutor was Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner, who was elected in 2016 following the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown in the suburb of Ferguson. Gardner came into office pledging to reduce mass incarceration and promote rehabilitation over punishment.\n\nBut from San Francisco to Philadelphia, prosecutors like Gardner have faced pushback from the police and, in several cities, from their own courtroom assistants. Politicians and voters have tried to remove some of these prosecutors from office - and, in a number of cities, they have been successful.\n\nMurphey's resistance to Gardner - Chigurupati's boss when Vincent's case went to trial - was unusual and, perhaps, extreme. By his own account, he was willing to help murder suspects walk free to make a point, even if he arrested them and believed that they should be behind bars.\n\nIn 2019, Gardner added Murphey to a list of police officers who would not be allowed to apply for criminal charges because of questions about their credibility, and she said her office would evaluate whether those officers could testify in court. Although the identities of those officers were not made public, one of Murphey's supervisors notified him that his name was on Gardner's list.\n\nA weekly newsletter about wrongdoing in America\n\nThanks for signing up.

Support independent journalism by donating to ProPublica.\n\nWeeks later, a prosecutor in Gardner's office notified Murphey that the office not only would actually let him testify in the cases he had led that were heading to trial - it expected him to.\n\nMurphey, who retired in September 2021, said he felt stuck in a Catch-22. If Gardner was going to impugn his character and question his credibility, he decided, he wouldn't cooperate with her prosecutors. He believed that if he went to court, defense lawyers would use his inclusion on Gardner's list to attack him on cross-examination, making the trials more about him than the defendants.\n\nSince that time, he has refused to testify in at least nine murder cases in which he served as lead detective. He said he told prosecutors that, if they subpoenaed him to testify, \"I'm going to sit on the stand and I'm not going to answer any questions.\"\n\nHis refusal, according to prosecutors, contributed to their decisions to offer defendants in at least four of the murder cases plea deals with reduced charges and lighter sentences. Prosecutors were still able to get murder convictions in three cases.\n\nIn one case, prosecutors dropped the charges altogether , saying the office \"did not have witness participation.\" Though it wasn't clear if Murphey's refusal contributed to the decision, he said the prosecution would have been hamstrung without him because he had collected evidence and conducted interviews in the case.\n\nVincent's case was the only acquittal at trial.\n\nMurphey never faced discipline from the police department for refusing to testify, a fact that criminal justice experts find astonishing. They said his refusal undermined not just the integrity of the cases but also the police department's commitment to justice.\n\nGardner battled the police and their union over her platform throughout her nearly six and a half years in office. But she also struggled with a host of internal issues, from the departure of dissatisfied prosecutors to a growing backlog of cases that the office could not manage. Those issues contributed to stinging criticism of her leadership - initially from law enforcement but then from even her own prosecutors.\n\nIt wasn't until this May that staff departures became so numerous and pressure on her to resign so fierce that she stepped down. In exchange for her resignation, Republican lawmakers agreed to drop a bill that would have allowed the state to take over the circuit attorney's office. The Republican attorney general also dropped a lawsuit seeking to force her out.\n\nRobert Tracy, the St. Louis police chief, did not respond to an interview request. Gardner did not respond to requests for comment, and she has retreated from public life. The office is now run by Gabriel Gore, a former federal prosecutor appointed by Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, to serve until an election next year. Gore has issued updates about his supervision of the office, including hiring dozens of prosecutors and reducing a backlog of pending cases.\n\nMurphey, who sees himself as a righteous renegade in St. Louis' beleaguered law enforcement system, wishes other officers had taken similar stands against prosecutors like Gardner. But he said he understands why they haven't. \"They have wives, they have kids, they have tuition, medical bills,\" he said. \"But me - it's just me and my wife, and my wife is like, 'Go for it.'\"\n\nAt least 10 other officers refused to cooperate with Gardner's team, according to interviews and court records. But Murphey stood apart because of his crucial role in some of the city's most significant, and most violent, cases.\n\nWhile expressing some sympathy for the family of the victim whose fatal beating Vincent was tried for, Murphey stood by his decision not to cooperate.\n\n\"Brian Vincent should be sitting in a penitentiary right now for the rest of his life,\" he said. \"But he's not.\"\n\nThe report of a suspicious death came across Murphey's desk just after sunset on a cold November evening in 2018. A man named Larry Keck had been found in his bed, partly covered by a sheet, his face and body severely battered.\n\nMurphey pulled up to a four-family flat in Shaw, a neighborhood of red brick homes on the city's south side. As he stepped into Keck's apartment, a painting in the living room caught his eye. It depicted an Italianate-style mansion in Lafayette Square, and it stirred a memory from his childhood. The mansion had once been owned by Keck, whom Murphey had known when he was young. Keck had spent his working life restoring some of St. Louis' grandest homes, fixing windows and other architectural elements. Murphey had once helped him move furniture.\n\nMurphey and other officers quickly zeroed in on Vincent, 40, as a suspect. Police reports and interviews show that Vincent and Keck, who was 68, had been in a romantic relationship, and that Vincent had been staying at Keck's apartment on and off after getting out of prison earlier that year. A friend of Keck's told police she had seen them together at his house late the night before.\n\nVincent had at least 31 felony convictions at the time and had served five stints in prison over the previous two decades; the longest was six years. His most recent conviction was for a 2014 home burglary, where he stole hundreds of dollars' worth of electronics and jewelry, according to police and court records.\n\nSix months before Keck's death, neighbors called the police one night as Vincent loudly banged on Keck's door for 45 minutes. An officer provided Keck with a form to request a restraining order against Vincent, but there's no record of Keck filing it. Keck's friends told police they had noticed bruises on him in the past, leading them to suspect that Vincent was abusing him. Keck had also told the friends that Vincent was stealing from him.\n\nMurphey brought Vincent to police headquarters for questioning and placed him in a small, windowless room. According to a video of the interrogation, which Murphey provided, Vincent told Murphey and another detective that he and Keck had been out with friends the night before Keck was found dead and that some of them had gone back to Keck's apartment at about 10 p.m. to smoke crack cocaine. Vincent said that afterward he slept in the alley behind the house and woke around 2 a.m. He said he then walked downtown - a distance of 4 miles - to see his probation officer.\n\nMurphey questioned Vincent's account, pointing out that his clothes, which Vincent said he was still wearing from the night before, were remarkably clean for someone who had slept in an alley. He noted, too, that the overnight temperature was 19 degrees, making it difficult to believe that Vincent had slept outside. Vincent seemed indignant, telling Murphey that he should be looking at Keck's drug dealers as possible suspects.\n\n\"Some of them are probably dangerous,\" he said in the video of the interrogation.\n\nMurphey told Vincent that he believed Vincent had killed Keck. When Vincent asked for a lawyer, according to the video, Murphey ended the interrogation, arresting Vincent on a first-degree murder charge.\n\nMurphey later tracked down two maintenance workers who had been at the building. One of them picked Vincent out of a photo lineup, according to police reports, and said he saw Vincent go in and out of Keck's apartment a short time before Keck's body was discovered.\n\nMurphey said in a sworn deposition, taken by Vincent's lawyer as part of pretrial proceedings, that the lack of a plausible alibi was \"what sealed it for me,\" according to the deposition.\n\nVincent, in a brief interview, said he was innocent and described Keck as a close friend: \"We worked together and had our differences but he was a good man.\" He called Murphey a \"crooked cop\" who tried to frame him.\n\nHe said Murphey \"didn't have the balls to show up\" at his trial.\n\nMurphey started his working life in 1982 at age 17 as an Army cook, and three years later he enlisted in the Air Force as a security specialist. During Operation Desert Storm, he spent close to two years at bases in Europe, but he returned to the U.S. and Whiteman Air Force Base in western Missouri when his wife became ill.\n\nDuring his time at Whiteman, he got a part-time job as a police officer in La Monte, a small town near the base. It was light work, he said, watching over a general store and a handful of shops.\n\nMurphey returned to St. Louis and entered the police academy, graduating in May 1995. Two years later, he was named officer of the year in the city's 9th police district. The head of a neighborhood association had written a letter to Murphey's captain commending Murphey for helping to oust drug dealers from a problem property.\n\nParis Bouchard, who wrote that letter, said he remembered Murphey as being uncommonly accessible and helping to \"bring amazing change to our block.\"\n\n\"He was so good at what he was doing,\" Bouchard said.\n\nMurphey became a detective in 2007 - work that he said satisfied his curiosity. \"I like finding out what happened. I'm nosy,\" he said. Four years later, he won a coveted transfer to the homicide unit.\n\n\"I'm not saying that I was the greatest,\" Murphey said. \"But you know, to get there, you've got to be able to prove yourself. You did your time on the street.\"\n\nIn audio recordings of his interviews with witnesses and suspects, which Murphey provided, he seemed to balance sternness with empathy, establishing an initial rapport before launching into his questioning. His questions started out broad, then zeroed in on details.\n\nIn one recording, he began to question a suspect's wife by asking, \"What kind of dogs you got? I've got pit bulls myself.\" Then he moved to the matter at hand. \"You weren't with him today when he shot at this lady?\"\n\nScott Ecker, who supervised Murphey in the homicide unit, called him a great detective. \"You're just not going to find a more passionate individual that actually cares about not only the victim but the victim's family,\" he said.\n\nYet Murphey was prone to office disputes. He accused colleagues of tampering with his phone and desk. When residents protested against police brutality, he criticized Black leaders who put a spotlight on racial bias within the department, sometimes accusing them of twisting facts to ascribe racial motives to situations where he believed race was not a factor.\n\nHis comments didn't go unnoticed. Sgt. Heather Taylor, then a supervisor in the homicide unit and the leader of an organization for Black officers, challenged Murphey's comments as racially insensitive. Murphey, in turn, said that he complained to the command staff about what he viewed as Taylor's false claims of racism in the department.\n\nIn a recent interview with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch , Murphey named three Black, female leaders - Gardner, Taylor and St. Louis Mayor Tishaura Jones - as the reason many officers had left the department. He called the women \"catalysts that broke the system.\"\n\nTaylor, who is now the city's deputy public safety director, said that during their time in the homicide unit, she had dealt with complaints about Murphey being insubordinate and combative with colleagues. \"If fighting racism is me breaking the police department,\" she said, \"I hope more people do exactly what I did.\"\n\nGardner and the police force were at odds even before she was elected. Speaking to supporters days before her resignation, she recounted a meeting with officials from the St. Louis Police Officers Association before the election, where, she said, union officials told her, \"We will let you be in this office if you make sure you never hold any police officer accountable.\"\n\nRepresentatives for the union did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nDuring her first year in office, Gardner accused the police department of withholding evidence in about two dozen cases in which a police officer shot someone, and she asked the city to launch an independent team to lead all investigations into such incidents. A city bill to create the team did not advance to a vote.\n\nThe police union, meantime, routinely criticized Gardner, saying she refused to issue criminal charges in cases where officers had made arrests; they argued that she rejected far more cases than her predecessor, Jennifer Joyce. In response, Gardner said the cases often lacked sufficient evidence .\n\nGardner's first high-profile prosecution was one she inherited from Joyce: a murder case against Jason Stockley, a white St. Louis police officer who was accused of shooting and killing a Black man during a chase and then planting a gun on him. Stockley was acquitted, which sparked street protests. Gardner said the acquittal showed the need for independent investigations of police shootings, which she said her office should lead .\n\nIn August 2018, Gardner created what became known as her \"exclusion list,\" which she said included 28 officers whose conduct had undermined their credibility . She said prosecutors would refuse to issue charges in any case involving an officer on the list that depended on their testimony.\n\nSome officers, however, would still be allowed to testify on cases that had been launched before the list was created. Murphey wasn't yet on the list.\n\nProsecutors are required to disclose to the defense any evidence that may favor the accused or undermine the credibility of a witness. A national police chiefs association recommends that police departments inform prosecutors when any issues arise that could affect officers' credibility, such as making false reports or expressing racial bias. But St. Louis police have not had a procedure for this. Joyce said the extent to which the police department shared such information depended on who was the chief at the time. \"Some were more forthcoming than others,\" she said.\n\nNationally, the approach to these lists varies. While some prosecutors offices don't maintain such lists, others do but choose to keep them private. Some offices, including that of State's Attorney Kim Foxx in Chicago, have made them public. Joyce said her office did create internal records on officers to be excluded from prosecutions but mainly operated with a \"mental list.\"\n\nGardner's replacement, Gore, said he had no exclusion list and had no plans to try to keep tabs on officers with credibility problems. He said that was up to the police department to do.\n\n\"I don't have the attorney manpower to send people over and have them scouring through police personnel files, looking for things that might potentially be relevant to a witness's credibility and necessary to be produced at a trial,\" Gore said.\n\nThe first batch of names on Gardner's list included officers who had refused to cooperate with her office in cases where they had shot someone. The police union said after Stockley's trial that other officers who had used force to arrest suspects feared becoming targets of prosecutors. Gardner said their refusal to testify prevented her from bringing cases to trial. Tensions continued to rise after the police union said it wanted the state legislature to change the law so Gardner could be impeached or recalled.\n\nOne afternoon in March 2019, St. Louis police officers entered Gardner's office with a search warrant and seized a computer server. The raid had been ordered by a special prosecutor investigating a perjury claim tied to an investigator in Gardner's office. But an appeals court intervened and the police returned the equipment.\n\nGardner saw the raid as a direct affront to her authority. She sharply criticized the police , accusing them of deploying tactics \"to intimidate, harass and embarrass this office.\"\n\nIn June 2019, the Plain View Project , a national research project that identifies officers across the country making racist, violent or anti-Muslim social media posts, released a database that included posts from St. Louis officers. Using the information, Gardner added 22 more names to the exclusion list, telling the city's public safety director and police chief in a letter that the posts were \"shocking and beneath the dignity of someone who holds such a powerful position.\"\n\nMurphey was one of those officers whose social media posts were exposed and was added to the list. After the Stockley acquittal, he posted that the protestors were supporting \"a violent thug,\" and he referred to Gardner as \"kimmy g.\"\n\nOver several interviews with reporters, Murphey said he was not a racist. He said he had a right to express his views, particularly about the Stockley case. He had been involved in the initial investigation of Stockley, he said, and said that Stockley \"did not commit a crime.\"\n\nMiriam Krinsky, a former federal prosecutor and currently the executive director of Fair and Just Prosecution, a think tank focused on prosecution reform, said if an officer's posts indicate troubling attitudes or biases, prosecutors are right to question \"whether they still have integrity and still can be trusted to pursue their job in a fair and unbiased and professional way.\"\n\nFoxx, the state's attorney in Cook County, said in an interview that \"credibility matters.\" A defense attorney, she added, would be able to use those posts \"to demonstrate how this person described the victim of a crime, and his credibility before a jury or before a judge would be called into question.\"\n\nBut R. Michael Cassidy, a law professor at Boston College and an expert in prosecutorial ethics, said that Gardner's use of the list seemed fraught. He questioned why a prosecutor would expect any officer on an exclusion list to cooperate with them.\n\n\"You might take the position that 'I've justifiably alienated the police officer and there's a public interest in not having racist police officers,'\" he said. \"Now you have to deal with the consequences of that.\"\n\nThose consequences can be significant, including allowing some defendants to go free even though they may have committed serious crimes because a prosecutor can no longer call an officer to the witness stand. As a result, prosecutors who keep these lists need to be selective about who they include, said Alissa Marque Heydari, a former Manhattan assistant district attorney who is now a research professor at Vanderbilt University.\n\nA more flexible approach, Heydari said, would be for prosecutors to keep another list of officers who have committed misconduct that would not be disqualifying - an officer who was arrested for drunken driving, for instance - but that must still be disclosed to the defense as part of a robust effort to fulfill legal requirements. It's the difference between using a scalpel and a chainsaw.\n\n\"Once you put them on that list, there's not much flexibility,\" said Heydari. \"You can't then go back and say, 'Well, I need this officer because it's a homicide.'\"\n\nAfter Murphey was placed on the exclusion list, supervisors struggled to find a role for him since any case he became involved in would be compromised. At times, he did nothing more than stream movies at his desk.\n\nLeft Sitting Idle\n\nMurphey describes how he spent his time at the police department after he was placed on a list that questioned his credibility and, as a result, was excluded from case work. This has been condensed for clarity.\n\nAt the same time, some former colleagues said, he openly criticized the police department's management and talked more and more about Gardner. Some detectives who shared his criticism of the circuit attorney came to understand that it could harm their cases if he played a role in them.\n\nIn August 2019, two months after Murphey was placed on the exclusion list, he was transferred to the patrol division. He would no longer wear a suit to work. The department issued him a standard blue uniform and assigned him to respond to radio calls. He was a beat cop again.\n\nThen, in January 2020, Gardner filed a federal civil rights lawsuit accusing the city, the local police union and others of a coordinated and racist conspiracy to force her out of office. Murphey's Facebook posts were among the evidence she cited.\n\nGardner's clash with the police only seemed to bolster her reputation among city voters. After a resounding victory in the August 2020 Democratic primary, her reelection was all but assured.\n\nWeeks later, a federal judge dismissed her lawsuit, deeming it \"nothing more than a compilation of personal slights.\"\n\nAlthough Murphey was downgraded to patrol, his murder cases continued moving forward in court. Lining up and preparing the testimony of the lead detective is a basic step for prosecutors as they get ready for trial. The lead detective often weaves together the details of a crime and the investigation that followed, providing a narrative for the jury.\n\nBut if the lead detective is absent, the prosecution can be undermined. Key information about the crime scene and witness interviews, which the detective usually provides from the witness stand, may be lost. Jurors may suspect something is amiss.\n\nThe cases against Terrence Robinson and Naesean Thompson, two men charged with first-degree murder in the 2017 shooting of Raymond Neal, were the first of Murphey's investigations to head to trial after Gardner put him on the exclusion list.\n\nMurphey's investigation had found that the incident started when Neal got into an argument with Thompson, who was allegedly selling drugs outside a convenience store. Neal grabbed Thompson's jacket and the men began to fight. Thompson pulled out a gun. Robinson - who was there with Thompson - then pulled out his own gun and shot Neal, according to police.\n\nMurphey obtained surveillance video from the store, which showed the shooting. He interviewed witnesses, helped identify Thompson and Robinson as suspects, and wrote the police reports that concluded that the two men were responsible for Neal's death.\n\nThe prosecutor handling the case, H. Morley Swingle, recognized how important Murphey was going to be and sought clarification about Murphey's status from a top Gardner official. The official assured Swingle that Murphey could testify, according to an email from Swingle to Murphey's attorney, which Murphey provided.\n\nAlthough Gardner had indefinitely banned certain officers, Murphey wasn't one of them. He fell into \"some lesser category,\" Swingle wrote in the email. Still, Murphey refused to testify for Swingle.\n\nIn October 2019, Swingle made a deal with Robinson: He dropped the murder case, and Robinson pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and armed criminal action. Robinson was sentenced to seven years in prison with eligibility for parole early in the third year of his incarceration, far less than he would have received if convicted of first-degree murder.\n\nRobinson was released on parole last year. He could not be reached for comment and his attorney did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn February 2020, Thompson pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and was sentenced to time served in the city jail. He did not respond to a request for comment through his lawyer, Neil Barron. Barron said that while proving the murder charge against his client to a jury would have been challenging, \"Murphey refusing to testify absolutely makes this a harder case to prosecute.\"\n\nMarcia Miller, Neal's mother, said that prosecutors told her that a plea bargain was their only option in the case \"because of the evidence,\" even though she reminded them that they had a videotape of Robinson killing her son. She said that the prosecutors never mentioned that Murphey had refused to testify.\n\nSwingle said Murphey's refusal to cooperate was not the only factor influencing his decision to accept a plea deal in the Robinson case. He said it would have been difficult to secure a murder conviction for a killing over a drug deal, even though it had been captured on video.\n\nMurphey refused to testify even as prosecutors negotiated what he viewed as lenient deals with defendants he was convinced were guilty of particularly brutal crimes and deserved life sentences.\n\n\"Do What I Can Do\"\n\nMurphey describes his reasoning behind refusing to testify.\n\nOne of those defendants, he said, was Collin Aubuchon, who was charged with killing Richard Kladky in March 2019. The men had been staying in the same sober living facility, but after clashing over Aubuchon's flirtatious text exchange with Kladky's wife, Kladky moved to another facility.\n\nOn Kladky's first day at his new home, Aubuchon used GPS to locate Kladky and shot him five times, killing him. He then surrendered to a security guard and claimed he had just shot someone who had threatened him.\n\nDuring the interrogation, Aubuchon confessed, saying Kladky had been sending him threatening texts warning him to keep away from his wife, according to a video of the interrogation, which Murphey provided to the news organizations. While examining Aubuchon's phone and tablet, Murphey found that Kladky had threatened to hurt Aubuchon if he didn't stop flirting with his wife, the video showed. Aubuchon, in turn, taunted Kladky by saying he was going to have sex with her.\n\n\"I was just being an asshole,\" Aubuchon told Murphey.\n\nWith the confession in hand, Murphey said that he viewed the case as a \"slam dunk\" that would have resulted in a life sentence - if he had cooperated. \"I don't know of anything that would mitigate what he did,\" Murphey said.\n\nIn May 2021, Assistant Circuit Attorney Chris Desilets agreed to a plea deal with Aubuchon that called for a 13-year prison term for voluntary manslaughter; Aubuchon is scheduled for release in early 2026.\n\nIn a brief telephone interview from prison, Aubuchon said he didn't know Murphey had refused to testify against him and acknowledged that he might have benefited from that refusal. He said he took a plea deal rather than risk life in prison.\n\nDesilets said that pushing the Aubuchon case, as well as others, to trial without Murphey's cooperation would have been like \"playing chicken.\" He said he did the best he could to get justice for the victims.\n\n\"Roger caused a lot of problems,\" he said.\n\nEric Lee Boehmer, Aubuchon's lawyer, said that while he wasn't sure how important Murphey's testimony would have been to the prosecution, his refusal to testify wasn't the sole factor influencing the plea bargain. He said there was strong evidence his client acted in self defense.\n\nKladky's relatives said they were never told about Murphey's refusal to cooperate in the case.\n\nMary Kladky, his sister, said it was \"heartbreaking\" that a police officer would abandon a case. As for Aubuchon, she said, \"Just as we're beginning to heal, he's going to walk free.\"\n\nMurphey's refusal did not always sink a case. At times, prosecutors still went to trial without him. Three cases proceeded to trial without Murphey's cooperation - each resulting in first-degree murder convictions. In one of the cases handled by Desilets, he said the prosecution would have been \"smoother\" with Murphey's testimony.\n\nIn some cases, prosecutors could not even salvage a plea deal. Chigurupati, the prosecutor in the Larry Keck murder, went to trial against Brian Vincent without his lead detective.\n\nIt's hard to pinpoint the impact of Murphey's absence on the outcome of the case. Missouri law considers records from criminal proceedings confidential after an acquittal, so reporters were unable to get a copy of the trial transcript, which could have illuminated the prosecution's shortcomings.\n\nIn an interview, one juror said gaps in the evidence hurt the case, but that the absence of the lead detective was particularly noticeable. He said he wondered, \"Why the heck weren't there a couple of key players there?\" said the juror, who spoke on condition of anonymity to protect his privacy. \"Why wasn't the lead detective there?\"\n\nA second juror noted that, although Murphey's absence wasn't a pivotal factor, the prosecution seemed to her \"scattered.\" Vincent's lawyer adeptly cast doubt on his guilt, leaving her believing in his innocence.\n\nMurphey said his absence likely prevented Chigurupati from presenting a coherent narrative of the crime and investigation. \"I'm pretty much sure that me not being there didn't help the case at all. If I'm sitting on a jury and the main detective's not there, I'd be wondering why,\" he said.\n\nDuring his holdout, Murphey agreed to testify in one case: the trial of Eric Lawson, who was accused of murdering his 10-month-old son, his ex-girlfriend and her mother in 2012. Murphey agreed to cooperate because Gardner's office recused itself due to a conflict of interest, leaving the prosecution with then-Attorney General Eric Schmitt, a vocal critic of Gardner.\n\nMurphey also said he felt a special duty to one of the victims, the sister of a police officer. \"The bias,\" he explained, \"is it's a policeman's family. And, you know, we're all supportive for each other.\"\n\nIn pretrial motions, defense attorneys argued that Murphey's credibility was a central issue in the case, and said that, during the trial, they should be allowed to ask him about his Facebook posts and his removal from the homicide unit. Since Lawson was Black, they contended that Murphey's use of the word \"thug\" and his disrespectful nickname for Gardner \"could be perceived by jurors as evidence of racial animus.\"\n\nThe judge in the trial refused to allow the defense to cross-examine Murphey about his social media activity, saying it \"may be unprofessional, but it's not racist.\" Murphey ultimately testified at trial and, in May 2021, a jury convicted Lawson and sentenced him to life in prison without parole.\n\nMurphey never faced disciplinary action for his refusal to cooperate with prosecutors. In fact, the police department continued to send him to investigate cases after he was placed on the exclusion list. He continued to draw the same salary.\n\nMurphey said that, in mid-2020, during staffing shortages in the worst months of the pandemic, his supervisors asked him to work again as a detective, though not in the homicide unit. Murphey said he warned supervisors that putting him back on investigations was ill-advised. \"I said, 'I'm not going to be good to you, because I'm just going to be sitting there,'\" he recalled. He even cautioned supervisors about pairing him with a partner as a way to work around his restrictions.\n\nPeter Joy, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis who specializes in legal ethics, said Murphey's stance was \"absurd\" and a \"dereliction of duty.\"\n\n\"If you're hired to do something, you do it,\" he said. \"You don't have to love your boss. If you hate your boss, you should leave. But don't sabotage the work you're doing.\"\n\nBut he said the police department was wrong as well to let Murphey continue investigating cases while he was on Gardner's exclusion list because the department knew his involvement could compromise those cases.\n\nJoyce, Gardner's predecessor, said it was hard to believe the department allowed Murphey to refuse to testify for so long. \"The mindset that 'I'm not going to testify in murder cases as a protest' is, I believe, unprofessional,\" she said.\n\nCassidy, the Boston College law professor, said \"the police chief needs to order that person to testify, and on threat of discipline.\" He said the prosecutor \"needs to either convince the police chief to order him to testify or needs to go to court to get a subpoena, and when he refuses to come in, ask the court to issue an arrest warrant for his appearance.\"\n\nNone of that was done. Desilets said forcing Murphey to court would have done no good. Murphey would have still refused to testify and become a hostile witness. And hostile witnesses, he said, are \"mostly ineffective with jurors.\"\n\nJust before her resignation, Gardner had scored a major victory, one that epitomized what many say is the ideal role of progressive prosecutors. On Feb. 14 of this year, a local judge exonerated Lamar Johnson , who had spent almost three decades in prison for a crime he did not commit. Gardner had spearheaded the effort to free Johnson after her conviction integrity unit uncovered prosecutorial misconduct and shoddy police work in his case. The state attorney general's office under Eric Schmitt, before his election to the U.S. Senate in November 2022, had opposed the effort .\n\nBut a series of events quickly sapped her political support. Four days after Johnson's release, a 17-year-old visiting downtown St. Louis for a volleyball tournament was struck by a reckless driver and had to have both legs amputated. The driver had been free on bond even though he had violated the conditions of his release dozens of times.\n\nThe responsibility for the lapse was unclear , falling somewhere between Gardner's office and the judge , but public outrage rained hard on Gardner. Republican lawmakers began to push for legislation that would allow the governor to appoint a special prosecutor to handle violent crime in St. Louis, effectively undermining Gardner's authority.\n\nMayor Tishaura Jones, a former Gardner ally, added her voice to the criticism. She said Gardner had lost the \"trust of the people.\" Attorney General Andrew Bailey, who succeeded Schmitt, sued to remove Gardner from office.\n\nThen Gardner's office, which had been losing key lawyers, failed to appear on the first day of a high-profile murder trial of a man accused of killing someone on the grounds of the Gateway Arch. Gardner's office blamed the snafu on a staff attorney not properly requesting time off; a text message from that lawyer, which became public, showed him writing of Gardner: \"I half expect her to be in jail before my vacation ends.\"\n\nThe following week, Gardner's office failed to show up at a hearing in the case of a man accused of shooting an 11-year-old. The prosecutor's office had already missed the first day of the scheduled trial, and this second no-show prompted the judge to appoint a special prosecutor to consider contempt charges against Gardner and the prosecutor assigned to the case.\n\nThe judge, during a court hearing, called Gardner's office \" a rudderless ship of chaos .\"\n\nGardner dug in. But the following weeks saw her office embroiled in additional controversies, including the resignation of a prosecutor who criticized her leadership. As her office continued to lose staff, it was revealed that Gardner was enrolled in an advanced nursing program , a possible violation of a state law requiring the circuit attorney to give their \"entire time and energy\" to their official duties.\n\nA few days before her resignation, Gardner spoke from the pulpit of a church to a few dozen supporters and said she \"never had a fair shake.\" All along, she said, she was surrounded by people \"who have colluded and conspired inside this office and out to make sure we're not successful.\"\n\nOne unresolved murder case that involves Murphey - though he did not act as lead detective - is the 2015 death of Kristopher Schmeiderer, who died from a knife attack that had occurred in 2014.\n\nBefore Schmeiderer's death, Andrew Lynn Barnett had been convicted of first-degree assault and armed criminal action for attacking Schmeiderer. But the Missouri Supreme Court overturned the conviction in 2019, ruling that the judge in the case had erred by not giving the jury an instruction that self-defense could have justified the attack, even though Barnett had claimed in his defense that he didn't attack Schmeiderer at all.\n\nIn 2021, the circuit attorney's office charged Barnett with second-degree murder. A trial is expected this fall.\n\nRead More\n\nThough Murphey didn't testify at the assault trial, he did contribute to the evidence collection. He helped find clothes that Barnett allegedly discarded in a sewer after the attack and seized them as evidence.\n\nNow, his testimony has become more valuable. One of the detectives who testified at Barnett's first trial has since died, and the circuit attorney's office is trying to line up its witnesses - including Murphey.\n\nKathy Schmeiderer, the victim's mother, said she hopes Murphey will testify.\n\n\"We want justice for our son, to close the wound,\" she said.\n\nBut Murphey said he won't take the stand.\n\nSacha Pfeiffer of NPR contributed reporting.\n\nFiled under -\n\nI am a St. Louis-based reporter covering Missouri and the Midwest.\n\nI'm interested in tips about abuses of power, political influence, harmful policing and court practices, reproductive rights, public spending, and illegal or unethical business practices in Missouri and the Midwest.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

In Stebbins, every cop has a criminal record, including the chief.\n\nby Kyle Hopkins , Anchorage Daily News\n\nSexual Violence in Alaska\n\nThis article was produced in partnership with the Anchorage Daily News , a member of the ProPublica Local Reporting Network .\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nSTEBBINS, Alaska - When Nimeron Mike applied to be a city police officer here last New Year's Eve, he didn't really expect to get the job.\n\nMike was a registered sex offender and had served six years behind bars in Alaska jails and prisons. He'd been convicted of assault, domestic violence, vehicle theft, groping a woman, hindering prosecution, reckless driving, drunken driving and choking a woman unconscious in an attempted sexual assault. Among other crimes.\n\n\"My record, I thought I had no chance of being a cop,\" Mike, 43, said on a recent weekday evening, standing at his doorway in this Bering Strait village of 646 people.\n\nHe was wrong.\n\nOn the same day Mike filled out the application, the city of Stebbins hired him, handing him a policeman's cellphone to answer calls for help.\n\nSubscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\n\"Am I a cop now?\" he remembers thinking. \"It's like, that easy?\"\n\nThe short answer is yes. With low pay and few people wanting the jobs, it is that easy in some small Alaska communities for a convicted felon, even someone who has admitted to a sex crime or who was recently released from prison, to be hired with public money to work as a city police officer.\n\nIt's also a violation of state public safety regulations , yet it happens all the time.\n\nIn Stebbins alone, all seven of the police officers working as of July 1 have pleaded guilty to domestic violence charges within the past decade. Only one has received formal law enforcement training of any kind.\n\nThe current police chief pleaded guilty to throwing a teenage relative to the ground and threatening to kill her after drinking homebrew liquor in 2017. (Alcohol is illegal in the village.) He was hired a year later. He declined to answer questions in person and blocked a reporter on Facebook.\n\nTwo men who until recently were Stebbins police officers pleaded guilty to spitting in the faces of police officers; one was the subject of a 2017 sexual assault restraining order in which a mother said he exposed himself to her 12-year-old daughter. (The officer named in the restraining order said he was busy and hung up the phone when asked about his criminal history; the other officer admitted to the crime.)\n\nThe seven-man police force has served a combined six years in jails, prisons and halfway houses on dozens of criminal charges. That doesn't include Mike, who was terminated on March 29, city records show. He says he wasn't given a reason, but the city administrator said it was because he wasn't responding to calls and didn't get along with another officer.\n\nProPublica and the Anchorage Daily News reported in May that one in three Alaska communities has no local cops of any kind. In June, U.S. Attorney General William P. Barr declared a \"law enforcement emergency\" in rural Alaska, announcing $10.5 million in Justice Department spending to support village police.\n\nIn the villages where there are cops, a different problem has emerged. A first-of-its-kind investigation by the Daily News and ProPublica has found that at least 14 cities in Alaska have employed police officers whose criminal records should have prevented them from being hired under Department of Public Safety regulations. The news organizations identified more than 34 officers who should have been ineligible for these jobs. In all but three cases, the police hires were never reported by the city governments to the state regulatory board, as required.\n\nIn eight additional communities, local tribal governments have hired tribal police officers convicted of domestic violence or sex crimes.\n\nAll 42 of these tribal and city police officers have rap sheets that would prevent them from being hired by the Anchorage Police Department and its urban peers, as Alaska state troopers or even as private security guards most anywhere else in the United States. Many remain on the job today.\n\n\"It's outrageous that we have a situation where we have a, such a lack of public safety that communities are resorting to hiring people who have the propensity for violence,\" said Melanie Bahnke, a board member for the Alaska Federation of Natives , which represents 191 tribes. \"And placing them in a position where they have control over people and possibly could victimize the victims further.\"\n\n\"That's like a frontier mentality,\" said Bahnke, who is also chief executive for Kawerak Inc., a Nome-based tribal consortium that oversees state-paid police in the region .\n\nA key part of the problem: There aren't enough state troopers or other state-funded cops to go around. When it comes to boots-on-the-ground law enforcement, village police officers (VPOs) and tribal police officers (TPOs) working in Alaska villages are at least as common. Yet no one keeps track of who these officers are, where they are working, if they've passed a background check or if they've received any training.\n\nThe state agency that regulates Alaska police has suspended efforts to solve this mess.\n\nAlaska Police Standards Council Director Bob Griffiths said his agency barely has the time to fulfill its regular duties of juggling complaints and appeals involving certified police officers. It doesn't have enough money to also visit rural Alaska so it can research ways to fix police hiring practices. That effort will come in the fall, at the earliest.\n\nYet the stakes are high. The same Alaska towns that have no police, or criminals working as cops, are in areas with some of the highest rates of domestic violence and sexual assault in the country.\n\nWhen a case relies on an arrest by an untrained cop who has a criminal record, prosecutors sometimes do not want to put that person in front of a jury and instead might drop or reduce felony charges, Griffiths warned. \"I could see felony domestic violence assault cases that end up being pleaded down to harassment or coercion.\"\n\nNome District Attorney John Earthman agreed that sometimes happens, and that cases involving untrained officers sometimes lack key evidence such as recordings of initial interviews. He said public defenders have raised concerns about some police because they have defended those same officers on recent criminal charges.\n\n\"I've been out here almost 20 years and some of these are realities that you just don't see in the city,\" Earthman said. Still, the hiring of Mike as a village police officer came as a surprise.\n\n\"If he's the only one who took a statement from a suspect or a defendant, that may be an issue.\"\n\nThe story of how Alaska communities came to quietly hire criminals as police officers, without consequence or oversight, is the story of how cash-poor local governments found themselves without law enforcement and few options.\n\nThere are several different forms of police in rural Alaska.\n\nThe best trained and best paid are state troopers. More than 300 work across Alaska, but just one-third are based off the road system.\n\nNext is a class of cops unique to Alaska: village public safety officers (VPSOs), who are nearly as well-trained as troopers and are also paid by the state. But the number of VPSOs appears to be at an all-time low, with just 42 officers statewide this year, compared with more than 100 in 2013 .\n\nOn the same day the federal government announced millions in emergency funds for Alaska rural police in June, Gov. Mike Dunleavy revealed he had vetoed millions from the VPSO program, saying the money was for vacant positions.\n\nDunleavy, a Republican, has declared a \"war on criminals\" and vowed to punish sexual predators. \"If you hurt Alaskans, if you molest children, if you assault women, we're really going to come after you,\" Dunleavy said at a July 8 crime bill signing .\n\nAsked moments later why the Alaska Police Standards Council has suspended efforts to revamp law enforcement hiring regulations, given that men convicted of sex crimes are working as police in some villages, Dunleavy offered no specifics but said he planned to hold meetings over the summer with \"stakeholders.\"\n\nBahnke, the head of the Nome-based nonprofit that employs VPSOs, said that only five of the 15 communities in her region have VPSOs and called on the state to spend unused salaries on equipment, housing and other amenities that would make it easier to recruit new officers.\n\nAlaska Native leaders once sued to force the state to provide armed, trained police in villages, but their lawsuit failed in state court. That leaves VPOs and TPOs to pick up the slack. They tend to be younger, paid less and have less training than traditional police.\n\nVPOs, such as those in Stebbins, are mainly expected to enforce city laws such as curfews and misdemeanors. In practice, however, they must sometimes handle life-and-death encounters such as standoffs and suicide threats. TPOs perform a similar role but are employed by federally recognized tribes and are not regulated by the state.\n\nOf the emergency village law enforcement funding announced in June by the attorney general, $4.5 million will go to hire tribal officers who will not be required to undergo background checks.\n\nBut lack of funding for cops isn't the only problem. Many villages have no housing for police, no secure jail cells or no public safety building. When Barr visited the state in May to see the problem for himself, he called the lack of services one of the most pressing public safety needs in the United States.\n\nOur review also found that villages have routinely ignored - or said they were unaware of - laws that require training and bar people with certain criminal records from being hired.\n\nLast year, the Daily News reported on isolated cases of people with criminal records working as police in remote Alaska villages. That story focused on a case at the edge of the Arctic Circle, in the tundra village of Selawik, where the city employed an officer who had been convicted of bootlegging and faced a pending charge of giving alcohol to a minor when he sexually assaulted an underage girl. The 16-year-old died the night of the attack, and the city settled a subsequent wrongful death lawsuit for $300,000. (The officer pleaded guilty to rape and furnishing alcohol to a minor in that case but was not charged in her death. He has not responded to numerous interview requests.)\n\nWhat happened in Selawik is far from an isolated example, our comprehensive examination shows. Between January and May, ProPublica and the Daily News identified 50 city and tribal governments that employ officers. Some would not provide names, but of the 159 officers identified, more than 42 have been convicted of or pleaded guilty to assault or another crime, most often domestic violence, that is typically a bar to working in law enforcement.\n\nLeaders in some communities, including Stebbins, say they have little alternative but to hire anyone they can.\n\n\"It's easy to look at in that light, 'How could these people hire criminals to do this job?'\" said Jason Wilson, public safety manager for several Southeast Alaska villages .\n\n\"When you live in a community and you're desperate, you are absolutely desperate for some law enforcement and to have somebody step up that might have a blemished record, you are willing to say, 'OK, I think person is still going to do OK for us.'\"\n\nAsked if the criminal backgrounds of some TPOs and VPOs hamper investigations or undermine prosecutors' cases, Alaska's Public Safety Commissioner Amanda Price said the local officers are vital to fighting crime in far-flung communities.\n\n\"Our troopers regularly say that, while tomorrow they might have to arrest a VPO or a TPO, today they are critical,\" Price said.\n\nIn village after village, troubling examples abound.\n\nIn Mountain Village, population 864, one recent VPO awaits trial on charges of stealing from a murder scene . Court records show five other recent VPOs in the same Yukon River community are awaiting hearings or have admitted to criminal charges including four counts of disorderly conduct, three counts of assault, two cases of neglect, two cases of drunken driving, two charges of harassment and three cases of domestic violence.\n\nAlong the Norton Sound coast, the city of Shaktoolik in May hired a VPO who has pleaded guilty to five assault charges within the past 10 years. \"He was our only applicant so we had no other choice,\" a city employee said.\n\nAmong those hired as TPOs in the fishing villages of Kasigluk and Tuntutuliak, located among the vast web of river-fed lakes in western Alaska, are registered sex offenders who admitted to abuse of a minor or attempted sexual abuse of a minor. The Kasigluk tribal administrator said he was directed by the tribal council not to talk to a reporter about the issue. In Tuntutuliak, Administrator Deanna White said the village council was willing to hire an offender on a part-time basis because of constant turnover and a lack of applicants in the high-stress job.\n\n\"Every time we hired, they wouldn't last,\" she said.\n\nIn the Kuskokwim Bay village of Kwigillingok , a 33-year-old man worked as a tribal police officer while subject to a long-term domestic violence restraining order. He was indicted in February on charges of sexually abusing an 11-year-old and is awaiting trial in a Bethel jail. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nAnd in the nearby Kuskokwim River village of Napakiak, recent police hires include William Gibson Smith as a TPO.\n\nSmith was picked to patrol the village despite a complaint filed two years earlier by a young mother whose 3-year-old daughter told her that her bottom hurt. The girl later confided that Smith had touched her there, according to an application for a sexual assault restraining order filed in Bethel court. Based on a \"preponderance of the evidence,\" a magistrate ordered that Smith, who was not present at the hearing, stay away from the family. (Such an order is not automatically disqualifying, but the regulations say candidates must be of \"good moral character.\")\n\nDespite the judge's orders, a matter of public record and discoverable on a public court database, Smith was hired to perform police work in Napakiak. He had the power to place his neighbors in custody and to hold them against their will if he declared them to be drunk or disorderly. In October, the Alaska State Troopers arrested Smith on charges of having sex with a different underage girl , and he has been in custody since. Today he is awaiting trial in that case and in another, in which he was charged with sexually assaulting a woman in police custody. He has pleaded not guilty in both cases.\n\nSexual abuse runs rampant, public safety resources are scarce, and Governor Mike Dunleavy wants to cut the budget.\n\nIn Stebbins, Louise Martin said she knows all too well the toll that officers with criminal records can take on a town. She recently filed a restraining order against a current city police officer, accusing the man of threatening her in person and through Facebook messages in which he said he would beat her up. Prior to his hire, the officer had been convicted of domestic violence and bootlegging.\n\n\"For him to be a cop, he shouldn't be acting like this, especially if there's kids + elders around,\" Martin wrote in her application for the restraining order. An initial order was granted but a longer-term one was denied because Martin did not participate at a hearing.\n\nMartin grew up in Stebbins and isn't unsympathetic to the needs of the village. \"They need a trooper in town.\" But she said the city cops \"hide behind their badge and harass people and drink on the job.\"\n\nStebbins, an Inupiaq and Yup'ik village, survived a generation of monstrous sexual abuse by a Catholic priest and church volunteers. It is plagued by 12% unemployment, and its lone grocery store charges twice as much for food as it costs in Anchorage. As the lack of police data regarding missing and murdered indigenous women raises concerns nationwide, residents of Stebbins and neighboring Saint Michael say the suspicious death of a local woman, 19-year-old Chynelle \"Pretty\" Lockwood , in 2017 remains unsolved.\n\nThe city offers no benefits to part-time officers who walk into life-and-death emergencies. They are untrained and unarmed, their only equipment a cellphone and a pair of handcuffs. The police department, like most homes, has no flush toilets or running water.\n\nNext to hauling waste, residents say being a cop is one of the worst jobs in town. In 2001, the mayor of Stebbins was shot in the face as part of a robbery scheme involving a 20-year-old man who had been working as a VPO despite jail sentences for assault and animal cruelty.\n\n\"I was not very fond of that [hire] in the first place,\" then-Mayor Robert Ferris told the Daily News at the time , having survived the shooting. But, he reasoned, \"In a place like this you take any help you can get.\"\n\nAfter serving time in prison for his role in the mayor's shooting, the former VPO returned to Stebbins and was eventually hired back by the city as a police officer, current city officials said.\n\nLittle has changed in recent years.\n\n\"Other people don't want to apply,\" said the current Stebbins city administrator, Joan Nashoanak, when asked why her local government has hired so many VPOs with criminal backgrounds. \"They are willing to work.\"\n\nIn Alaska's largest city, the Anchorage Police Department receives 18 applications for every cop it hires. Each recruit is subject to criminal background checks, drug tests and polygraphs.\n\n\"It's incredibly important for our department to uphold those standards because they are key to upholding the public's trust in law enforcement,\" said APD Chief Justin Doll, who serves on the Alaska Police Standards Council board. \"If the public looks at a law enforcement officer and sees a lengthy criminal background, it undermines that trust.\"\n\nAnchorage police pay starts at $33.61 an hour plus benefits, retirement and a union.\n\nIn Stebbins, Nashoanak said it's impossible to avoid candidates with a felony or a misdemeanor within the past five years, who should be prohibited from serving as cops by law, because of constant burnout and turnover. Officers are paid $14 an hour.\n\nFactor in small-town politics and the pressure to look the other way when an influential person or family gets in trouble, and it's easy to see why officers are constantly quitting.\n\n\"It's a problem, but it's never really been addressed,\" Nashoanak said. \"We can't find anybody else without a criminal background.\"\n\nA former city administrator, Doreen Tom, says she has complained to the city about the officers' conduct and rap sheets.\n\n\"These guys are criminals,\" Tom said of the VPOs. \"There's qualifications to be a police. What you can't be and what you can be. You can't have a misdmeanor within five years and these policemen, there's police who were charged with rape. People who were charged with assault.\"\n\nOne recent Stebbins VPO is 24-year-old Harold Kitsick Jr., who has worked off and on over the past year despite a conviction for spitting in the face of a police officer in nearby Kotlik in 2013. The victim in that case said Kitsick had threatened to kill him, his 6-year-old child and his wife and vowed to burn down his house. The Kotlik officer said that he could smell gasoline around his home and that he waited out the night with a gun handy, afraid for his life.\n\nReached by phone, Kitsick denied that he threatened the police officer but admitted to attacking him. \"I assaulted him, I hit him. I spit on him and kicked him. That was it.\"\n\nThe Kotlik VPO quit being a police officer soon after the encounter with Kitsick. He asked not to be identified because his wife still works in the region. He, too, was a VPO with a criminal record, he said. The city of Kotlik recruited him despite an assault charge that should have prevented him from being hired under state law.\n\n\"There's really no background checks to it,\" he said.\n\nStebbins city records show Kitsick stopped working as a police officer on May 28 after two years on patrol. He sometimes tried looking for different work with better pay and more hours, he said, but jobs are scarce in the village.\n\n\"Then [the city] asked me to go back. I was, like, 'Well, might as well,'\" said Kitsick, who is currently awaiting trial on two new charges. Troopers accused him of punching a woman in the face and punching fellow Stebbins VPO John Aluska in two separate 2018 incidents. He has pleaded not guilty to both.\n\nAluska, who himself was convicted of domestic violence in 2010 and 2014, said he hasn't been in trouble in years and is part of a roster of about seven officers who some Stebbins residents said work well together.\n\n\"The current ones we have are pretty good,\" Stebbins health aide Tania Snowball said of the police force. While she spoke, Snowball cleaned a gleaming chum salmon, hauled moments earlier from the Bering Sea. \"The ones in the past, they never answered their phones.\"\n\nAs a health aide, Snowball said she partners with VPOs. If there were no police - or if the city couldn't hire people with criminal records - Snowball said there would be no one to assist her in emergencies such as suicide attempts or shootings. She would quit the clinic.\n\n\"You have to have somebody help respond, because most of the people that call are intoxicated. There's four-wheeler accidents or serious injuries,\" she said. \"VPOs gotta be available.\"\n\nA few hours after the health aide finished cutting fish along the foaming shoreline, Aluska began the midnight to 4 a.m. patrol. Rain beaded on his four-wheeler, a Honda shared by the entire police force.\n\nAluska circled the village in a wide loop. There are no stop lights and no paved roads in Stebbins. Most homes rest on stilts; red foxes and berry bushes hide in the knee-high grass. All groceries and vehicles arrive by plane or barge, and trailer-sized shipping containers in primary colors dot the yards. Aluska has lived here all his life.\n\n\"Go home!\" he hollered to a crowd of middle-school-age kids outside the gymnasium. More than 40% of the village population is younger than 19, and parents said it's hard to keep them indoors this time of year, when the sun dips low and red but never really sets.\n\n\"Don't make me tell you again,\" Aluska warned. A boy in a hoodie shuffled his feet, walking with exaggerated slowness.\n\nThe Honda engine clicked and popped as he turned off the ignition. The real trouble usually starts later. Everyone knows when the VPOs go off duty.\n\nIf someone is driving drunk, getting in fights or becomes a danger to themselves, they are held in one of three cells in the city jail. The building used to be a library, but it was converted when someone broke the fuel line at the old jail house, soaking the building in heating oil.\n\nAluska likes the new jailhouse. No one has broken out yet.\n\n\"In my time it was easier,\" Aluska said.\n\nThe 42-year-old said he got into his share of trouble when he was younger. Making homebrew. Escaping custody. \"It's been years ago now since I last went to jail.\"\n\nAsked if he had ever been convicted of domestic violence, Aluska said he had, in 1998, but the charge was dropped. State court records show he also pleaded guilty to domestic violence-related assault charges in 2010 and 2014.\n\nAluska doesn't think his record makes him any less able to keep the village safe. Same for his colleagues.\n\n\"Not really,\" he said. \"I get a call and, if you're drunk and doing bad things, I'll come get you.\"\n\nThe next afternoon the rain disappeared, replaced by a damp heat that sent kids splashing between gillnets.\n\nAt city hall, the Stebbins City Council gathered for a monthly meeting. Chairs ringed a cafeteria table beneath property maps of village landmarks: The Old Church. The Elder Center. The New School. Skin drums and a bingo scoreboard (proceeds help pay police salaries) adorned the adjacent community hall.\n\nOne by one, the police officers gave monthly reports and brainstormed public safety ideas. Officer Delbert Acoman suggested police begin wearing small body cameras purchased from Amazon; the police chief admitted he can't bring himself to shoot dogs when an animal needs to be put down. One officer who is the subject of a current restraining order wondered about turning a vacant building into a teen center.\n\nAt 45, Acoman said he's worked as a Stebbins police officer off and on for two decades. During that time, court records show, he has been convicted of a dozen crimes, including three counts of domestic violence. His last no-contest plea to assault came five years ago and Acoman said he's turned a corner - trying to provide for his wife and kids. A steady job makes that possible.\n\nAcoman headed home as his colleagues prepared for overnight patrols. Middle schoolers chased rebounds on an outdoor basketball court as two young men sat wrenching on a four-wheeler, fanning mosquitoes.\n\nAt the edge of town lives Nimeron Mike, the registered sex offender. While he was working as a police officer he could never shake the feeling that visiting state troopers might take him away to jail, instead of the people he arrested.\n\nMike said he is ready to go back on patrol any time the city needs him. He figures street smarts must count for something.\n\n\"I've done my time, now all I want to do is work and make money,\" he said. \"I'm a pretty good cop.\"\n\nFor now, the state of Alaska hasn't caught up with Mike's change in job status. The official state sex offender registry database still lists his employer as \"City of Stebbins.\"\n\nThe Anchorage Daily News and ProPublica have teamed up to listen.

Here are important methods and context you need to know.\n\nby Andrew Ford , Asbury Park Press\n\nHow New Jersey Cops Profit From Police Unions and Avoid Accountability\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nThis article was produced in partnership with the Asbury Park Press, which is a member of the ProPublica Local Reporting Network .\n\nThe death of George Floyd at the hands of police in Minneapolis has drawn historic levels of interest in police misconduct and drawn condemnation from law enforcement leaders nationwide.\n\nAs a reporter covering law enforcement for the Asbury Park Press in New Jersey, and now in partnership with ProPublica's Local Reporting Network, I use investigative reporting techniques to strengthen police accountability. Other journalists do the same . But, in truth, any citizen can apply the same methods to ensure the law enforcement system they're funding is serving them well.\n\nPolice culture can be insular and tough to penetrate. But I've been surprised by how often it's possible, though time consuming, to expose important issues by requesting and examining records and data from police departments and other government agencies and engaging citizens and key leaders. So here are five techniques concerned citizens, journalists and policymakers can use to examine police conduct in their communities.\n\nIf you're alarmed by what you saw in Minneapolis, or other recent incidents of apparent police misconduct, the first step is to find out if the agency in question has a written policy on the use of force. Does the policy dictate when officers should or shouldn't use force? What tactics are they allowed to use? Is there any rule against choking a suspect?\n\nIt's important to know if the officers involved were following the policies and procedures that are supposed to guide their behavior. Police actions that strike an onlooker as inappropriate may actually be within a department's rules. It's possible the rules themselves are inconsistent with best practices elsewhere.\n\nSubscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\nAsk the department for its policies on the practices that concern you, like restraining suspects or the use of pepper spray or Tasers. You may also need to request rules set by a county or state authority. Ask for written copies. You may be required to file a formal public records request, which I will describe below. And if there is no existing written policy, that might be something worth questioning itself.\n\nIf you're having trouble understanding a policy, try running it by an attorney, academic, elected official or a journalist in your community.\n\nHow I did it: I did a deep dive into policies about drug testing after a police captain was killed in a car crash in 2016, and I exposed that he was drunk and on drugs at the time . I spoke to his chief and learned their department didn't have a policy for random drug testing. I wondered why that was the case and looked to the state attorney general's office, which sets many police rules . The rules allowed departments to choose whether they wanted to do random testing, and my reporting identified more than 100 that did not . After our story, the state attorney general mandated random drug testing for cops across the state .\n\nYour tax dollars pay for just about everything a police department does, which includes generating tons of reports, dispatch logs, video recordings and data about what officers do every day. Any citizen is entitled to see those public records to understand how the government works.\n\nThe agency may say the public records law does not allow you to have access to some documents - information about confidential informants and medical records, for example. The laws that dictate what's considered public vary by state, so check out the national guide by the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press . Information the agency considers off limits may also be redacted, and it may take time to get a response.\n\nWe want to hear from police officers, public employees and community members who can help us learn more about police misconduct in New Jersey and why it's allowed to continue.\n\nEven with the hassles and limitations, public records laws are empowering and I've been surprised by how much I can obtain. My policy is always to ask and make a records clerk explain why I can't have taxpayer-funded records. Follow up to ensure important requests aren't lost or ignored. Assume you should be able to see everything. Your state's public records law may even include a presumption that records are open and exemptions are an exception. You may run into roadblocks that you can't overcome on your own. In some cases, journalism organizations have had to sue to obtain public records. Your budget may not allow for an attorney, but some states have mediators that you can go to if you think your request is being wrongly denied.\n\nIt's striking how much information the government collects but then does not review. So you might be the first person to ask for a particular body of records and put them together to identify an important trend which you can share with leaders who weren't paying attention to the issue. Your local journalists may also be very interested in the information you have gathered.\n\nSometimes it's hard to even know which records exist. That's where documents commonly known as records retention schedules come in handy. Government agencies use these to track which records they keep and how long they hold onto them. Use the schedules to help you see what you might be able to obtain. These are available all over the country. Just for fun, I looked up the city of Los Angeles - they call them records disposition schedules and found them for agencies ranging from the Police Department to the zoo . The agency of interest to you might use a different name for the document, so call them and ask if they have a written guide that shows which records they maintain and for how long.\n\nHow I did it: I started investigating police car chases after I saw the government keeps summaries of those incidents , including how many people are arrested or injured. I saw I could add up those figures and see if the benefits of the chases outweighed the risks and harm. I discovered that chases in recent years usually didn't end with an arrest, and that lots of people get hurt, including cops and bystanders.\n\nIf you're interested in scrutinizing the type of misconduct we saw in Minneapolis, you could request use of force reports. New Jersey made those public a few years ago, and Newark Star-Ledger journalists used them to great effect . ProPublica has that data available here for a fee .\n\nIf I were investigating a case of violence by the police I'd ask for:\n\nI might also request policies that dictate how an agency handles complaints against officers. Some states consider substantiated complaints against individual officers to be public records, so you could request them, depending on where you live. WNYC has a helpful breakdown of where that information is public. If you're looking for video from police body cameras, the Reporters Committee has a guide that shows the places where those are considered public. If you want to obtain recordings of 911 calls, they have a guide for those , too.\n\nYou could also be more general and ask the relevant department for substantiated internal affairs complaints alleging excessive force in the past year or so, if those are public in your state. Departments might keep summary data on internal affairs complaints, so ask for the most recent copy of that, too.\n\nEngaging law enforcement leaders is essential to understanding policing, and their involvement is key to fixing problems. My access and experience as a white man who works for a news organization may be different than someone else's experience. It also depends on who you talk to and their openness to criticism. But I think we stand the best chance of a good outcome if we deal with each other respectfully.\n\nMany policing issues are handled at the local, county or state level. Part of your work will involve figuring out who is responsible for the issue you're concerned about.\n\n\"All policing is local,\" former Milwaukee police Chief Edward A. Flynn told me. Like many cities, Milwaukee is also experiencing unrest and criticism of the police. Flynn, a well-known law enforcement leader, encouraged conversations between citizens and cops, possibly aided by a neutral third party like a local faith leader.\n\n\"The key to changing policing is on the ground level,\" he said. He added that it helps for citizens to praise the good work they see from their officers. He encouraged the public to consider crime statistics when scrutinizing police tactics.\n\nI have found that the police themselves are often open to talking to me about the problems in their profession. Many I have talked to feel bad when things go wrong.\n\nHow I did it: I've been amazed at who is willing to talk to me when I simply take the time to ask. As part of my investigation into police car chases , I talked to a former cop who lost her police officer husband when his vehicle was struck during a high-speed pursuit. I was touched by the way she took hours from her busy life to tell me some of her most painful memories and share her insights as a former cop.\n\nI took my findings to the attorney general, the state's largest police union and to lawmakers who vowed action. \"It appears to me there's a lot more harm done than good right now,\" one of them said about the high-speed incidents.\n\n\"If the community has an issue either positive or negative with their law enforcement, then they should definitely have a conversation with the mayor, council and police chief,\" said New Jersey Assemblyman Gordon Johnson, a former cop who has participated in community discussion about police issues.\n\nContact information for law enforcement leaders is often available online. They may regularly attend meetings that are open to the public.\n\nShow police leaders the problem that concerns you, using specific examples and quantifying the damage broadly. Show them the harm. Be careful to be fair. Frame the violations by showing how they go against policies or laws or best practices. Back up what you're saying with the evidence you've acquired.\n\nHow I did it: To highlight the dangers of police car chases, I introduced readers to Eric Larson, a young father killed when his car was hit by a motorcyclist fleeing police. Then I quantified the harm based on the records I had obtained: \"New Jersey police pursuits killed at least 55 people in the past decade and injured more than 2,500.\"\n\nRemember that there's always a different view to your perspective. Integrate it into your presentation if it is legitimate. Acknowledging the counterpoints helps you focus and ask tougher questions. In the car chase story, I made sure to also note incidents in which police chased a suspected killer and men wanted in connection to a shooting. Sometimes police chase violent criminals, but is it worthwhile for cops to chase someone for a traffic violation?\n\nPolicing is tough work, and there are times when cops use justified force. Differentiate how the issue you identified deviates from what's appropriate.\n\nChange is incremental and can take years. You will likely have to repeat yourself and persist in your efforts. But if you've found an issue of serious public importance - like the use of force incidents we've seen lately from the police - there may be ongoing examples you can point to as you make your case to decision-makers.\n\nKemp's explosive allegation, just days before the closely contested 2018 election, drew wide attention. But newly released documents show that there was no such hack.\n\nIt may be worthwhile to reach out to local journalists with what you've found. News outlets often have a tip line you can call. Or, find a reporter who covers similar issues and call or email them with what you've found. I take calls like this frequently and look forward to them. Academics who study criminal justice may also be interested. You can look them up at your local college or university. When reaching out to reporters or academics, keep it brief and focus on the facts.\n\nThe wave of protests is hitting home for many people, including in my newsroom in New Jersey. On Monday, police arrested my Asbury Park Press colleague Gustavo Martínez Contreras after he filmed officers tackling two minors to the ground in Asbury Park.\n\nI'm continuing to investigate police accountability problems in New Jersey this year in partnership with ProPublica's Local Reporting Network. If you have a tip for me, please share it .\n\nIf you have questions about applying the suggestions in this column, please email me at [email protected] . And if you find anything interesting as you start to investigate law enforcement practices, please let me know. I may want to follow up or promote your work online.\n\nWe want to hear from police officers, public employees and community members who can help us learn more about police misconduct in New Jersey and why it's allowed to continue.\n\nGet our investigations delivered to your inbox with the Big Story newsletter.\n\nCreative Commons License (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0)\n\nThank you for your interest in republishing this story.

      "text": "New Louisiana Law Serves as a Warning to Bystanders Who Film Police: Stay Away or Face Arrest\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nThis article was produced for ProPublica's Local Reporting Network in partnership with Verite News . Sign up for Dispatches to get stories like this one as soon as they are published.\n\nFour years before a Minneapolis police officer murdered George Floyd, prompting nationwide demonstrations, hundreds of people marched in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to protest officers' killing of Alton Sterling in front of a convenience store. Law enforcement responded in force: Officers armed with rifles, body armor and gas masks pushed protesters back and forcibly arrested about 200 people. Some were injured.\n\nA group of 13 protesters and two journalists filed suit, alleging their constitutional rights were violated when they were arrested. Eventually, the city agreed to pay them $1.17 million. Photographs and videos taken by protesters, witnesses and journalists were critical in contradicting officers' claims that protesters were the aggressors, said William Most, an attorney for the plaintiffs.\n\nOn Thursday, a Louisiana law will go into effect that will make it a misdemeanor for anyone, including journalists, to be within 25 feet of a law enforcement officer if the officer orders them back. The two independent journalists who sued, whose photos were used to support allegations against the police, said they wouldn't have been able to capture those images if the law had been on the books during the protests.\n\nKaren Savage was working for a news site focused on juvenile justice issues on the second day of the demonstrations in July 2016 when she photographed officers putting a Black man in a chokehold as they detained him. Cherri Foytlin, who was working for a small newspaper and a community media project, said she was within 4 feet when she photographed officers violently dragging a Black man off private property and arresting him.\n\nFoytlin and Savage said they are hesitant to cover protests in Louisiana now that they could face criminal charges if they're too close to an officer. \"I was thinking about how far exactly 25 feet is, and, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter. It's going to be whatever the officer wants it to be,\" Savage said. \"And if it doesn't get to court, it won't matter because they will have accomplished what they wanted, which was to get the cameras away.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, a coalition of media companies representing a couple dozen Louisiana news outlets, including Verite News, filed suit against Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill, State Police Superintendent Robert Hodges and East Baton Rouge District Attorney Hillar Moore III, alleging the law violates the First Amendment .\n\nIn a statement provided Thursday, Murrill said the law ensures law enforcement officers can do their jobs without being threatened or impeded by others. She said she looks forward to \"defending this reasonable response to documented interference with law enforcement.\" State Police spokesperson Capt. Nick Manale declined to comment on the suit; a representative for Moore did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nPolice buffer laws, as they are commonly known, are relatively new; Louisiana is the fourth state to enact one. Although those states already prohibit interfering with police officers, supporters say buffer laws are necessary to protect police from distrustful, aggressive bystanders. And with advances in cellphone cameras, including zoom lenses, supporters say there's no need to get close to officers in order to record their activities.\n\n\"There's really nothing within a 25-feet span that someone couldn't pick up on video,\" Rep. Bryan Fontenot, R-Thibodaux, the sponsor of Louisiana's bill and a former law enforcement officer, said during a legislative hearing this year. At the same time, he said, \"that person can't spit in my face when I'm making an arrest.\" (He did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nFoytlin disagreed. \"You can't even get an officer's badge number at 25 feet. So there's no way to hold anyone accountable.\"\n\nShe and Savage said police targeted them during the Baton Rouge protests because they were taking photos of protesters being slammed to the ground, dragged across the pavement, choked and zip-tied by law enforcement officers. Both journalists were charged with obstructing public rights of way and resisting arrest. Prosecutors did not pursue those charges.\n\nThe journalists and protesters sued the city of Baton Rouge, the East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff's Office and the Louisiana State Police, claiming law enforcement officers had used excessive force when arresting them. The Sheriff's Office was dismissed as a defendant because a judge concluded its deputies weren't involved with those arrests. The State Police settled for an undisclosed amount in 2021. The suit against Baton Rouge went to trial in 2023; the city agreed to the million-dollar settlement the day before closing arguments.\n\nNeither the Sheriff's Office nor the Baton Rouge Police Department responded to requests for comment. The Louisiana State Police declined to comment on the lawsuit or protests.\n\nFoytlin said she didn't think the settlement would cause law enforcement agencies to change their tactics; now, she believes they'll be emboldened by the buffer law to crack down more harshly on anyone trying to document officers' actions.\n\n\"From what I saw in Baton Rouge, and what they were able to get away with, I have no doubt that in the future, the consequences of trying to use your free speech or to protest are going to be much harsher,\" she said.\n\nGiven the inconsistent use of police body-worn cameras, said Nora Ahmed, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, often the only way people can guard against false charges and prove that officers used excessive force is to film them in close proximity. \"In the absence of video or audio evidence,\" she said, \"it's very difficult to convince anyone that the story occurred in any way different other than what the police report.\"\n\nSuch video was critical in a lawsuit Ahmed handled in which a woman sued two sheriff's deputies over her arrest in St. Tammany Parish, across Lake Pontchartrain from New Orleans.\n\nThe May 2020 incident started with an anonymous complaint about someone riding a motorcycle without a helmet in a Slidell neighborhood, according to the lawsuit. Deputies Ryan Moring and Kyle Hart showed up at Teliah Perkins' home, writing in an incident report that they saw Perkins ride a motorcycle without a helmet. In Perkins' lawsuit, she denied doing so.\n\nThe conversation quickly became heated. Perkins accused the deputies of harassing her because she is Black; the deputies wrote in the incident report that she was \"irate\" and verbally attacked them .\n\nPerkins called for her son De'Shaun Johnson, then 14, and her nephew, then 15, to come outside and record what was happening, according to the deputies' incident report and the videos. When they did, at least one of the deputies ordered them to go back on the porch, which was more than 25 feet away.\n\nThe boys ignored the deputies and continued to film from about 6 feet away. As Hart forced Perkins to the ground, Moring approached Johnson, shoving him and telling him to move back, according to Perkins' lawsuit and her son's video. When Perkins screamed that she was being choked, Moring stood in front of Johnson to block his view, he later admitted in his deposition. Moring then pointed his Taser at the boy.\n\n\"You can't tase a child,\" Johnson said, according to the lawsuit and the son's video.\n\n\"Watch me,\" Moring responded.\n\nPerkins was arrested for resisting a police officer with force or violence, battery of a police officer, having no proof of insurance and failing to wear a helmet. She was found guilty only on the resisting charge; the others were dropped. She sued the deputies in federal court, claiming they had violated her and her son's rights. An appeals court dismissed Perkins' claims against the deputies, but her son's claim against Moring went to trial. In May, a jury found that Moring had intentionally inflicted emotional distress on Johnson and awarded him $185,000, to be paid by the St. Tammany Parish Sheriff's Office.\n\nAhmed said she believes the jury was swayed by videos of the incident, which showed \"with clear granularity exactly what was transpiring.\"\n\nMoring denied in court that he intentionally harmed Johnson and has filed a notice of appeal. The deputies' lawyer didn't comment for this story.\n\nIn an interview with Verite News and ProPublica, Perkins said she fears what could have happened had the new law been in effect. The boys could have been arrested when they refused to move back to the porch. And from there, she said, neither would have been able to see or hear what was happening to her.\n\nJohnson, who is about to start his first year at Alabama State University, said the videos he and his cousin took that day are the only evidence of what actually happened. Without them, he said, no one would have believed a 14-year-old boy's claim that a deputy had threatened to shock him with a Taser simply because he was recording with a cellphone.\n\nThere were no police buffer laws when Floyd was murdered on a Minneapolis street in 2020. Seventeen-year-old Darnella Frazier stood several feet away and recorded a video that showed Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pressing his knee into Floyd's neck and back for more than nine minutes, causing Floyd to lose consciousness and die. The video was critical in securing Chauvin's conviction for second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. He was sentenced to more than 22 years in prison.\n\nFloyd's murder fueled protests across the country and efforts to rein in the police. New York City ended qualified immunity , a legal defense used to shield officers from civil liability. Many states restricted the types of force officers can use, according to the Brennan Center for Justice .\n\nThe video of Chauvin \"really drew people's attention to how powerful these recordings can be in inspiring protests and legislative action,\" said Grayson Clary, a staff attorney at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. \"I think some legislators are now trying to claw back ground that they feel they lost.\"\n\nArizona state Sen. John Kavanagh, a Republican from outside Phoenix who authored the first of these bills in 2022, wrote in an op-ed that police officers asked him to introduce it because \"there are groups hostile to the police that follow them around to videotape police incidents, and they get dangerously close to potentially violent encounters.\"\n\nKavanagh's bill, which was signed into law by then-Gov. Doug Ducey, prohibited people from filming police within 8 feet. But federal courts across the country have affirmed the right to film the police, and a federal judge struck down the law after a coalition of media outlets and associations sued the state.\n\nIndiana was the next state to pass a similar law. It, like the two others enacted since, doesn't mention filming and requires people to stay at least 25 feet from police. That's based on a controversial theory, often cited to justify police shootings, that someone armed with a knife can cover 21 feet running toward an officer before the officer can fire their weapon.\n\nShortly after the law was enacted in April 2023, an independent journalist sued the city of South Bend after an officer pushed him 25 feet from a crime scene and another officer ordered him to move back another 25 feet. The journalist claimed in the lawsuit that it was impossible to observe the crime scene from that distance. The state denied in court that the journalist's rights were violated.\n\nIn January, a federal judge dismissed the journalist's suit, stating that officers have a right to perform their jobs \"unimpeded.\" The judge said 25 feet is a \"modest distance ... particularly in this day and age of sophisticated technology\" and that \"any effect on speech is minimal and incidental.\" That case is under appeal.\n\nA second lawsuit in Indiana, filed in December by a group of news organizations and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, is pending. They are suing the state attorney general and the prosecutor and sheriff of Marion County, where Indianapolis is located, arguing that it is \"essential for reporters to be within 25 feet of law enforcement in order to record them.\" In a court filing, the defendants have argued that the law doesn't infringe on reporters' ability to record police activities.\n\nFlorida's law went into effect in April. An early version of that bill specified that it did not apply to the act of peacefully recording, photographing or witnessing a first responder, which it called a \"legitimate purpose.\" That language was taken out of the bill before it was passed.\n\nRep. Angela Nixon, D-Jacksonville, proposed changing the bill's name to \" The I Don't Want the World to See the Police Kill an Unarmed Innocent Man Like George Floyd Again, So I Want To Protect Bad Cops and Violate Free Speech Act.\" Her amendment failed.\n\nIf these laws stand up to constitutional challenges, \"we're going to see more states go down this road,\" said Clary of the Reporters Committee.\n\nThe effect of Louisiana's law may be limited in New Orleans, where the police department has been under federal oversight since 2013 due to widespread abuses , including excessive use of force and racial discrimination. New Orleans Independent Police Monitor Stella Cziment said the law may violate a court-approved list of reforms, which states that police must allow people to \"witness, observe, record, and/or comment\" on officers' actions, including arrests and uses of force. Another provision says officers cannot arrest anyone for being nearby or recording them except under certain conditions, including risks to the safety of officers or others.\n\nIn response to questions from Verite News and ProPublica, the New Orleans Police Department said it is revising its policies to account for the new law, and those policies could \"restrict officers' actions\" more than the law does. The NOPD said the Department of Justice and a team of court-appointed monitors will review any changes; neither responded to requests for comment.\n\nRead More\n\nHowever, the Louisiana State Police, which recently sent a contingent of troopers to New Orleans under a directive from Gov. Jeff Landry, does not have to abide by the terms of the consent decree , according to a federal judge. As such, troopers are free to invoke the new law.\n\nThe State Police is being investigated by the Department of Justice following a 2021 Associated Press investigation that uncovered more than a dozen incidents over the past 10 years in which troopers beat Black men and sought to cover up their actions . The State Police didn't respond to a request for comment on those incidents.\n\nWhen asked how troopers are being trained to use the new law, Manale said only that they undergo regular training on how to engage with the public. The State Police, Manale said, \"strives to ensure a safe environment for the public and our public safety professionals during all interactions.\"\n\nDrew Costley of Verite News contributed reporting.\n\nUpdate, Aug. 1, 2024: This story was updated to include a comment from Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill about the lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of Louisiana's buffer law.\n\nFiled under -\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "The COP29 deal is even smaller than it looks\n\nSign up for Semafor Net Zero: The nexus of politics, tech, and energy. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nNegotiators at COP29 rescued the summit from near collapse â but with an agreement that will leave just about everyone frustrated, and is likely even worse than the disappointing headline number indicates.\n\nUnder the deal, rich countries will take the lead on raising at least $300 billion per year by 2035 to support climate adaptation and emissions reductions projects in developing nations. Other donors â including less wealthy countries (read: China), development banks, and private investors â are invited to chip in. The agreement also âcalls onâ all these parties to work, on a voluntary basis, toward a far loftier goal of $1.3 trillion. The figures are far lower than what many in Baku had hoped for.\n\nTurning those numbers on a page into hard cash in the hands of the most climate-vulnerable countries will be a challenge. Recent history, and the new language adopted in Baku, donât bode well.\n\nâThe commitments made in Baku â the dollar amounts pledged and the emissions reductions promised â are not enough. They were never going to be enough,â said Ralph Regenvanu, climate envoy from the island nation Vanuatu. âAnd even then, based on our experience with such pledges in the past, we know they will not be fulfilled.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nIn the decade since the first global climate finance target, $100 billion, was set, countries like Vanuatu have had a front-row seat to everything that can go wrong as rich countries work toward the headline number. And the agreement reached in Baku isnât very reassuring that things will be better this time.\n\nFirst, thereâs the number itself. Inflation and the ever-escalating costs of climate impacts mean the number gets less impressive over time; so even though the target is nominally higher than the current goal, some delegates in Baku saw it as a step backward. Economists also doubt that $300 billion in government funds is anywhere near enough to âleverageâ an additional $1 trillion from the private sector; historically, $1 of public finance unlocks an average of 22 cents from private investors, according to the think tank ODI. And in any case, the actual amount of funding developing countries need for climate action is closer to $2.3 trillion, economists said last week.\n\nThat means the $300 billion number will need to be increased. The Baku agreement punted this discussion to next yearâs COP in Brazil, so the money fight is far from over. In the meantime, raising funds will get a lot harder once Donald Trump takes office; in his last term, the US kept up some climate finance through its contributions to development banks but cut off most other channels.\n\nThen thereâs the critical question of how the funding is tallied. Depending on whoâs counting and how, especially whether loans are given equal standing with grants, the actual amount raised now is somewhere between $28 billion and $116 billion . The Baku decision leaves a lot of ambiguity about what exactly will count, and cues up what is sure to be a titanic political fight in 2028 when the COPâs finance committee will have to deliver a progress report.\n\nFinally, the Baku agreement does little to open the myriad bureaucratic bottlenecks that today keep a lot of climate finance from reaching its intended recipients in a timely manner, if at all. The most important test for the new goal is whether it can work better. But to that end, the agreement is filled with weak language: When it comes to improving access, the agreement âurges,â âwelcomes,â and âencouragesâ parties to do better, rather than stronger commands such as âinstructsâ or âdecides.â\n\nOne key demand of the negotiating blocs representing small island states and the least developed countries in Baku was that the new finance goal include a specific minimum percentage that should be set aside for them. At the moment, only about 1% of climate finance reaches small island states, said Colin Young, executive director of the Caribbean Community Climate Change Center, which coordinates between Caribbean countries in the negotiations. Such countries lack the staff and expertise to manage the mountains of paperwork required to submit funding proposals, and most climate finance is available on a first-come-first-served basis, advantaging middle-income countries with more developed bureaucracies.\n\nBut minimum allocation requirements were cut from the Baku agreement, which led the island state bloc to temporarily walk out of the talks . Ultimately, they relented. But âthere is very little in the agreement,â Young said, âto deal with the systemic inequities that continue to stymie the flow of climate finance to the most vulnerable countries.â\n\nGiven how close the talks came to falling apart, the fact that any finance deal was struck is a sign that COPâs approach to multilateralism isnât irreparably broken.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor net zero"

      "text": "Analysis: COP29 risks undermining COP28âs breakthrough\n\nSign up for Semafor Gulf: Navigating the regionâs capital, influence, and power. Read it now .\n\nNobody imagined these last two weeks at COP29 would be easy. Getting to a just and equitable energy transition means coughing up an uncomfortable amount of money â at least $1 trillion a year for developing countries, activists and researchers say â at a time when the West is painfully cash-strapped, with anemic growth, wars in Europe and the Middle East, and elections that have made Washingtonâs future commitment at best uncertain.\n\nâElections have consequences,â John Kerry, the former US Special Envoy for Climate, told me. Whatever else is decided as the COP29 climate summit closes in Azerbaijan, ânoneâ¦ ultimately will rise to the level of what COP28 was able to accomplish. That was the most powerful thing since the Paris agreement was created, and now those plans have to be more specific, more comprehensive, and bigger.â\n\nBut with just hours to put a price tag on climate reparations owed by the worldâs industrialized economies to their partners in the Global South, COP29 risks derailing a major accomplishment of its predecessor â namely, getting the right people in the room and keeping them there.\n\nâIt is a cycle of timing,â Kerry says, âbut the mandate out of COP28 couldnât be clearer, and that mandate is we must transition away from fossil fuels and do so in an orderly, just, and equitable manner.â\n\nBut whereas COP28 â led by Dr. Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, the CEO of Abu Dhabiâs national oil company and the UAEâs Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology â was all about a necessary course correction, COP29 seems to have devolved quite quickly into a name-calling, ideological farce, with Azerbaijanâs president dropping truth bombs on day one. Oil and gas are a âgift of God,â he told the august assemblage, and no country should be blamed for using and exporting its natural resources in line with demand.\n\nNot an unfair assessment, on the face of it. But with the climate community still smarting from the previous year â where for the first time fossil fuels were included in the final text in relation to the energy transition â itâs no surprise some participants would not welcome their hosts rubbing âGodâs giftâ in.\n\nMeanwhile, the only attendee speaking much sense at all these last weeks â or even offering a plan â seems to be one of the former so-called âenemiesâ of climate change, Darren Woods, CEO of ExxonMobil. Woodsâ media blitz has included calling on President-elect Donald Trump to stick to the Paris Agreement, advocating the creation of a global carbon accounting system, and pushing an âall of the aboveâ approach to the transition that includes fossil fuels alongside renewables.\n\nâDr. Sultan was courageous enough to push back [on the climate community writ large] and insist that oil and gas be invited in,â Woods told me. âThe previous approach to date isnât working, the policies arenât working, despite effort and investment they arenât having an impact â oil, gas, and coal are up. It is time to roll up sleeves and move from pledges to plans.â\n\nItâs not the first time that the fossil fuel community has seemed to provide the COP process with the only grown-up in the room. But itâs about time those in the climate club understood that the only thing worth doing for governments and for corporations is something that makes commercial sense.\n\nâItâs undoubtedly true that the COP process hasnât yielded the necessary reduction in emissions overall,â admits the Environmental Defense Fundâs Fred Kruppe. âThey are at their highest level ever in spite of 28 years of the COP process. We need access from everyone, everywhere to tackle this and we cannot rely exclusively on the COP. The evidence is plain.â\n\nCOP28 gave the world the roadmap. Itâs on COP29 today to get the car on the road.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor gulf"

      "text": "Big oil looms over COP28\n\nSign up for Semafor Net Zero: The nexus of politics, tech, and energy. Read it now .\n\nCOP28 â the annual United Nations climate conference â is facing increasing scrutiny after the BBC reported Monday that host United Arab Emirates plans to use the Dubai summit to discuss oil and natural gas deals with several countries.\n\nThe meetings are to be led by COP28 president, Sultan Al Jaber, who is also the CEO of the UAEâs state oil company Adnoc and state renewables business, Masdar. One of the talking points in leaked documents seen by the BBC suggested telling oil-producing countries there was âno conflictâ between extracting oil and climate change. Oil executives have gone on the defensive amid months-long criticism over the presence of Adnoc and big oil at COP28, with OPEC saying that a recent International Energy Agency report, âunjustly vilifies the [oil and gas] industry as being behind the climate crisis.â\n\nWith Al Jaber being caught âred-handed,â the COP Presidency now has to âunequivocally step up the transparency, responsibility and accountabilityâ in leading the process, climate activist Christina Figueres writes on X. She compares the COP28 revelations in the BBCâs report to the âVolkswagen 2015 momentâ where the automakerâs massive âDieselgateâ scandal exposed the entire diesel car market to greater public scrutiny over pollution emission tests. Calling this âa deep challenge and a transformational opportunityâ for COP leaders, Figueres warns that the âplanet cannot afford for them not to step up.â\n\nAl Jaber has relied on highly paid consultants to manage his image as a palatable climate change envoy and COP president, the Intercept reported in October. They have branded him as a âfixerâ who can help build bridges between the fossil fuel industry and the climate change movement. But his refusal to step down as Adnocâs chief has âblurredâ the lines between the state-owned oil company and COP28, one former summit staffer said. Some PR agencies acting on behalf of COP28 were allegedly engaged by Adnic and Masdar rather than the COP team, the Intercept reported. Al Jaberâs appointment as COP president is, one climate media expert said, the culmination of a 30-year effort by big oil and energy companies to âset their own targets and create their own rules.â\n\nU.S. President Joe Bidenâs absence from COP28 is delegitimizing the summitâs mission, argues Jessica Davies for Proactive, a financial news site. As the worldâs largest producer of oil and second-biggest polluter, the U.S. is key in negotiating any future climate commitments, and it is a setback to not have Biden involved in these discussions. But several leaders of transitional energy and green initiative companies are also skipping the meeting, with one cleantech industry veteran calling the summit a âcircusâ that does little to help small and medium-sized businesses dedicated to reducing greenhouse emissions.\n\nSign up for Semafor net zero\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives."

The proposed âNew Collective Bargaining Agreement (NCQG)â is meant to replace a 15-year old commitment by developed nations to provide $100 billion annually to developing countries, which was only achieved in 2022 after years of missed targets.\n\nReforming the financial architecture to unlock more funds to back clean energy projects also remains a major concern for African participants at the conference. The African Development Bank (AfDB) unveiled a new program to factor Africaâs environmental resources such as using carbon sinks in estimating the continentâs wealth, allowing countries to access greater funds from international markets.\n\nPreliminary estimates by the bank indicate that carbon sequestration alone could have boosted Africaâs nominal GDP in 2022 by $66 billion, a 2.2% increase.\n\nâThat means that the countries can have larger headroom to take on more financing and invest them for the greening of their economies,â said AfDB president Akinwumi Adesina in a statement. âTherefore, such a move is important for re-computing Africaâs debt sustainability.â\n\nDeveloping countries, many of them in Africa, are disproportionately affected by climate change despite accounting for just 4% of global emissions.

      "text": "New York City mayor tells Harris: Keep talking like a cop\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams is cheering Kamala Harris for touting her law enforcement background despite progressivesâ past resistance to tough-on-crime messaging.\n\nâThe Democratic Party has a tendency to run away from public safety, but it is a very attractive criterion and is a very attractive part of your resume,â Adams, whose own successful 2021 run played deftly on his life as a crime-fighter with deep ties to Black New Yorkers, told Semafor. âI think that sheâs really using that as front and center, and thatâs really, really impressive.â\n\nHarris built her career in California as a âsmart on crimeâ prosecutor who sometimes positioned herself to the right of other Democrats on issues of law enforcement. But during her 2020 presidential bid, and amid nationwide protests against police brutality, Harris downplayed that reputation and took positions intended to win her friends on the left, praising demonstrations aimed at âdefundingâ the police, or at least shifting funding toward other services.\n\nâThis whole movement is about rightly saying we need to take a look at these budgets and figure out whether it reflects the right priorities,â she said on a New York radio show.\n\nAdams thinks that was a mistake.\n\nâShe did run away,â he said. âI donât think she should have moved away from it. I think that now you see, sheâs leaning into it.â\n\nHarris and Adams are both Black former law enforcement officers: The vice president was district attorney of Alameda County in California and of San Francisco before serving as the stateâs attorney general and senator. Adams is a retired police officer with more than two decades of service before his mayoralty.\n\nIn this article:\n\nDespite Adamsâ depiction of her top-cop posture as focused on public safety, Harrisâ prosecutorial rhetoric is more directed at Donald Trump these days.\n\nâI took on perpetrators of all kinds â predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So hear me when I say, I know Donald Trumpâs type,â she told staff soon after taking the reins of what was President Joe Bidenâs reelection campaign.\n\nLately, sheâs also homed in on her efforts to target banks during the wave of foreclosures that hit homeowners more than a decade ago. But we have yet to see her talk about public safety in the same terms as Adams, who last year broke so sharply with Biden that he got dropped from the presidentâs 2024 advisory board, as Axios reported at the time.\n\nSo itâs most helpful to view Adamsâ plaudits for Harris in the context of the past chasm between him and Biden, which focused on the presidentâs handling of migration across the southern border that left New York and other cities severely overtaxed.\n\nHarris recently released an ad that cites her prosecutorial experience in plugging her support for Bidenâs bipartisan Senate border deal â a proposal that Trump encouraged the GOP to kill. That suggests her law enforcement background might play an even bigger role in her pitch going forward, as Adams suggested.\n\nAnd while Adams campaigned on vows to curb crime, heâs familiar with the political balance between public safety and equitable policing that Harris tried to strike in 2020. Back in the mid-1990s, as a police officer, he helped found a group called 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care that focused on addressing tensions between Black New Yorkers and law enforcement over alleged misconduct.\n\nBut Harris might not want to take too many political cues from the New York City mayor given his own political struggles. Adamsâ approval rating sank to 28 percent in a poll released in December, and in April the Manhattan Institute found just 16 percent of likely voters in the city would support his reelection.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

For viewers, Rachel (Jennifer Aniston), Monica (Courteney Cox), Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow), Chandler (Matthew Perry), Joey (Matt LeBlanc) and Ross (David Schwimmer) are a group they couldn't imagine any differently. But if NBC had gotten its way when the show was still getting off the ground, there apparently could have been a much older friend in the mix.\n\nIn his new book Generation Friends , author Saul Austerlitz chronicles how NBC asked showrunners Marta Kauffman and David Crane to add an older secondary character to Friends Like Us - as Friends was still called at the time - in order to attract \"more mature\" viewers who might not relate to a group of 20-somethings. Although they weren't particularly enthused by the idea, Kauffman and Crane went through with writing a character they referred to as \"Pat the Cop\" into a script.\n\nBut as Friends fans likely know, Pat the Cop never ended up making an appearance.\n\n\"The writers made a good-faith attempt, even casting the role, but hated the resulting script so much that they pleaded with NBC to drop the idea,\" Austerlitz wrote. \"If only NBC would kill Pat the Cop, they promised, they would give their six protagonists parents in notable supporting roles, and find older guest stars to attract a more mature audience. NBC gave its permission, and Pat the Cop was no longer.\"\n\nIf nothing else, at least we have Pat the Cop to thank for Judy (Christina Pickles) and Jack Geller (Elliott Gould).\n\nWrite to Megan McCluskey at megan.mccluskey@time.com"

      "text": "What It's Like to Be a Cop in America\n\n'Every time a police officer fires his weapon, the reputation of the police department is on the line.'\n\n-Captain Joe Bologna, Philadelphia Police District 19\n\nTrevor Peszko wears the uniform of a Philadelphia cop with the same earnestness that made him a success in his first career, as a corporate trainer for Chuck E. Cheese's. \"They flew me to Vegas to dress up as the mascot for their GM convention,\" he says. \"That was my first time in Vegas. I was 19.\" And at 31, he's back in the city where he grew up, walking slowly toward the driver's-side window of a car that has just run a red light in a high-crime patch of town. Peszko is white. The driver is black. And as if the neighborhood does not look sufficiently desolate already, flies buzz around a rat dead on the pavement between them.\n\nPeszko walks past it and, when he reaches the rear of the car, pauses briefly to press his fingertips on the trunk. It's a routine move intended to address hazards that predate all recent controversies attending police work. The touch assures that, first, the trunk is indeed latched and will not, in some dramatic motion perhaps not seen outside of Hollywood, spring open to allow a hidden gunman to spray the officer with bullets. It also assures that in the somewhat less remote chance that the driver opens fire and takes off, he flees with his victim's fingerprints on the car.\n\nBut when Peszko reaches the driver's window and peers down, the only thing pointing at him is a cell phone. It's propped on the speedometer ledge with its lens turned outward, recording everything he does and says, which turns out to be: \"Just be straight with me: I know you're late for work.\" And \"Next time it might be a ticket.\"\n\nWherever a cop shows up today, so do people with cell-phone cameras. They hold them out from their bodies, like shields, and up in the faces of the officers, like taunts. \"They got a cell-phone 'gun,'\" says Anthony Jones, who like Peszko patrols some of the city's roughest neighborhoods. The phones have become so common in the crowds that are increasingly thronging arrests that the department circulated a flyer showing a \"gun\" with the barrel opened to hold an iPhone. It went out at roll call, along with the usual \"Be careful out there,\" in the hope that Philadelphia might avoid joining a list that much of the country can now recite from memory: Ferguson, North Charleston and, sadly, onward.\n\n\"Nowadays we're in a culture where everything's against the police, at least in the areas I patrol,\" says officer Ernie Williams. \"Social media, news outlets, they're really coming down on police. And we still gotta come to work. I pray nobody's going to get shot or hurt, but the reality is, somebody probably is. We still have a job to do. And at times it can be a very difficult job.\"\n\nNow would be one of those times. There are some 680,000 sworn police officers in the U.S., and in the past 12 months, every one of them has had to answer, in one way or another, for the actions of colleagues they will never meet except on the screens running the latest viral police incident. \"There's times,\" says Sergeant Francis Kelly, \"when you get resistance because of what happens in some other part of the country.\"\n\nFor most cops, the scrutiny is not debilitating. It is not even new. In many ways it is merely an intensification of what police have always encountered: the public's wary attention. Whether wrestling a suspect to the ground or buying a coffee at 7-Eleven, they are instantly the center of attention. The watchmen are used to being watched.\n\nWhat's changed is something else: the assumption of who is good and who is bad. In a Gallup survey in June, just 52% of Americans expressed confidence in the police, down 4 points from a year earlier and tying the lowest level since 1993. The atmosphere then was defined by the beating of Rodney King, recorded by a man on the balcony of his Los Angeles apartment with a Sony Handycam. Cops have always been tribal, keeping to their own in the weary belief that what they do is work only another cop could understand. Now everyone is an expert, and the zeal of bystanders \"with their cameras out, 'waiting for something to happen,'\" as one Philadelphia officer puts it, has altered the fraught dynamic between the arrested and the arresting.\n\nWhat's it like to be a cop in America today? To find out, TIME spent weeks with the police force that calls itself the nation's oldest-Philadelphia's was founded in 1797. It's a relatively diverse force-57% white compared with a national average of 80%-charged with keeping the peace in a particularly violent city. The city's 248 homicides in 2014 were three-quarters of the 328 in New York City, which is five times larger. Police commissioner Charles Ramsey, who like the mayor is African American, readily acknowledges that America's cops are facing a crisis.\n\nBut what does that mean day to day, more than a year after the killing in Ferguson altered the way many Americans think about police? The answer emerged in ride-alongs, station-house chats and sit-down interviews summed up in the words of one officer: \"Everything is just harder.\" Confrontations are more numerous, and when the blood is up, so is the risk of the very thing everyone is trying to avoid-in the tattered, volatile neighborhoods to which the rest of the world until recently paid as little attention as possible.\n\nCaptain Joe Bologna calls West Philadelphia's Police District 19 \"a microcosm of the city,\" and he presides over it like a mayor. It contains only 90,000 of Philadelphia's 1.6 million residents and 6.4 of its 142 sq. mi., but the 19th extends from some of the most expensive homes in the city-the mayor, district attorney and a Congressman reside in the lush greenery of the north-to hardcore urban neighborhoods in the south, where the precinct house stands next door to Mr. C's Love Lounge. \"Million-dollar homes and million-dollar bails,\" as Peszko says. \"We got it all.\"\n\nIt's a busy place. On a typical day, an eight-hour shift will answer 80 calls from 911 and stop 15 or 20 cars. Each encounter carries the potential to make national news, although most are more likely to produce insult than injury. That was the case inside a squad car on a Friday afternoon in mid-July, racing with siren and lights on toward a middle-class neighborhood where a knife fight has been reported in the road. The officers arrive to find nothing wrong, only a child and a bearded middle-aged man, who frowns. \"We don't pay attention to that,\" he says. \"Happens all the time. O.K.? So long.\"\n\nThe officers do a U-turn and bolt north to a driving range where two golfers, one black and one white, are fighting over, yes, a patch of shade. \"White privilege stops here, mister,\" says the black golfer, who has dialed 911. The white golfer has a bloody nick on his knuckle and a wreath of dried spittle around his mouth. Neither man wants to press charges, and the officers steer back to the 19th's southern section, where patrols spend most of their time, a dreary grid of broken roads, streetcar tracks and the corner takeouts known as Chinese stores. It is a rough neighborhood made just a bit rougher by a rich local tradition of cussing the police.\n\n\"F-ck the law,\" a woman says, glaring into the open window of a cruiser easing past a corner. \"That's the public, right there!\" chirps officer Damon Linder, smiling behind the wheel. The cops are so accustomed to the guff that when some 19th District veterans visit neighborhoods like South Philly, where people wave at cops, they feel disoriented. A truly exceptional event like the deadly May 12 Amtrak derailment on the city's northeast side, which brought residents and first responders together in an almost transcendent sense of community, has as the weeks passed assumed the quality of a dream: Did that really happen?\n\n\"I grew up in North Philly. Even up there they wouldn't yell at you when you drive by,\" says Ron Burgess, Linder's partner for the night. \"It's been going on a long time, but it's definitely getting worse.\"\n\nA moment later, an \"officer needs assistance\" call crackles on the radio, and Linder floors the cruiser, a Chevy Tahoe, and hits the siren. At each intersection he eases off until Burgess says, \"Good, right,\" indicating clear passage from his side. Year after year, roughly as many U.S. cops die in traffic accidents-49 last year-as in shootings (50), a toll that would likely be reduced by the use of seat belts, which police famously do not use. Officers say that's because a seat belt can snag on their thick police belts, and though it might require only a second to take off, what quickly becomes clear as the cruiser pulls up to the scene is how much a second can matter.\n\nWe arrive to see a pair of stockinged feet being pushed into the backseat of another Tahoe, the socks dangling from toes an officer is quickly feeling between. A few moments earlier, the suspect had been behind the wheel of a silver Pontiac now askew in the road. Tucked between the driver's seat and center console is a .45-caliber pistol, grip and trigger fully accessible for a quick draw. The car was registered to a different man wanted in a shooting, and when the trailing squad car hit his lights, the driver chose to leave the gun behind. The officer tackled him as he climbed out of the car.\n\nIt is difficult to exaggerate the prevalence of guns in the Philadelphia streets and the level of hazard that embeds in a cop's workday. Bullets fly so often in the district that at the scene of a shooting on North Allison Street-a young man shot in the hip and cursing the police who had rushed to help save him-I noticed a glint of something on the street outside the house where it had happened. It turned out to be a slug, the lead crumpled from impact. \"I think that's an old one,\" said Jones, who had already spotted the bullet. \"Looks like it's been there a while.\"\n\nThere's so much lead in the air, Burgess a few months earlier witnessed a murder without realizing it: three muzzle flashes, one of which killed a man on Master Street. His own brush with death also caught him by surprise. In March 2013, while wrestling a suspected robber to the ground, Burgess learned the man was carrying a pistol only when it was fired four times beside his face, blowing out his eardrum. He rolled away, drew his own weapon and fatally shot the man who had been shouting, \"I'm gonna die! We're gonna die!\" Burgess says the man turned out to be \"wet,\" meaning he was on the animal tranquilizer PCP, still common in these parts.\n\n\"Once you do something like that, you feel like you've done something wrong, even though you didn't,\" Burgess says. \"I had to reflect on that for a time. It's not routine at all.\"\n\nNot at the human level, perhaps, but Philadelphia cops shot and killed 15 people in 2012-a particularly striking number since violent crime was in sharp decline citywide, as the news site Philly.com pointed out. Ramsey asked the Justice Department to investigate. That decision helped put Philadelphia ahead of the curve on the national debate over police abuse, a new experience for a department still defined in much of the public memory by the 1985 police firebombing of the militant group Move, which killed 11 people and destroyed 65 homes. Ramsey has embraced many of the Justice Department's recommendations, and last year the number of people killed by Philadelphia police dropped to four. He is banking on education to reduce it further. Beginning this fall, new cops will be trained to identify their own biases and spend a week at the city's National Constitution Center learning about the history of policing in America. It has plenty of dark chapters.\n\n\"If you were in the South, you might have been tracking down slaves,\" Ramsey says. \"Who enforced Jim Crow laws? Police. So just as our democracy has evolved, so have we. But what about those people who were on the other side of that? That baggage is still there. It ain't gone away. So why is there more tension in one community vs. another community? A lot of it has to do with the history of policing. Now I'm not saying you spend your life looking in the rearview mirror, but I am saying you can't move forward until you understand where you've been.\"\n\nPolice see the viral videos just like everyone else but sometimes watch them differently. Some, like the shootings in North Charleston and Cincinnati, are not open to interpretation. But others show behavior that may look bad to the layperson but that police recognize as ambiguous. Watching the dash-cam footage of the Sandra Bland arrest, Sergeant Mariana Caprara wanted more information before condemning the Texas state trooper who appears to be escalating the situation out of spite. \"We can't see inside the car,\" she said. \"She could be reaching into her purse.\"\n\nBut for cops, the main beef with the videos that make the rounds on social media, collecting outrage, is that they begin long after the police have arrived at the scene. Viewers see the tussle around the arrest but almost never what the cops see: the behavior that summoned them to the scene in the first place and what transpired in the minutes before the crowds gathered and the cell phones came out.\n\nA few years ago-until Ramsey ordered them to stop, on First Amendment grounds-that feeling of injustice had Philly cops confiscating phones. Now it sharpens the appetite among police for cameras of their own, the \"body cams\" that departments around the country are using or considering. \"When we get a body cam, everything will be changed up,\" says Jones. \"When we do a traffic stop, we have to inform the driver immediately that the camera is on. That's why I'm all for it.\" So is Ramsey, though he warns against rushing. Serving as co-chair of President Obama's task force on policing gave him a clear view of the trap doors of privacy, expense, technology and, not least, storage that come along with cameras, all of which are better sorted through by departments now rather than in court challenges later. It also left him almost strikingly optimistic about where all this is headed.\n\n\"Oh, it's gonna be good,\" Ramsey says. \"Listen, it's a crisis. But as they say, never waste a good crisis. Because it's in crisis that you can implement the kind of change that you need. You wish you didn't have to go through it, but we'll come out better tuned to the community as a result.\"\n\nIt's all part of the imperative-transparency, show your work-that the Internet has enforced in so many other realms and which comes now to law enforcement. \"A lot of times the cameras on us are not a bad thing,\" says Brian Dillard, who grew up in the 19th and remembers that cops used to follow up a warning with a beating. \"A lot of cops had to know it is not the old days,\" says his partner, Robert Saccone. \"Time was, if you ran, you paid the running fee,\" meaning the punches dispensed to a fleeing suspect once caught.\n\n\"It's right that we're held to a higher standard,\" says Bologna. \"We have tremendous power.\" Like Ramsey, Bologna extols community policing, getting cops out of cars and back into the social mix. That prevention-based approach is difficult to pull off when modern policing is based on responding after a crime has been committed. Still, Bologna reaches out to citizens like a ward politician and urges his officers to explain themselves at every opportunity. \"It's amazing how many times people will say, 'Oh, I didn't know that,'\" says Jade Howard, an eight-year veteran.\n\nBut if it's possible to change the way officers approach the job, there is no changing some aspects of it. \"I'm not sure that my family wants to see the ins and outs of policing,\" says Linder. \"I mean, the people in this district might, but if someone doesn't want to be arrested and you have to arrest them, it's not going to be pretty.\"\n\nThe uglier, more stubborn reality on the streets of the 19th and of every other inner-city neighborhood. While Bologna's troops were patrolling in mid-July, a parade of U.S. politicians was across town at the national NAACP convention, where Topic A was law enforcement. Bill Clinton apologized for sentencing laws that produced the mass incarceration of African-American youths that even some conservatives want to end. The next morning, Obama became the first U.S. President to visit a federal prison, as Pope Francis will do in Philadelphia in September.\n\nBut is the fundamental problem law enforcement or those darker stretches of American history that Ramsey will send new recruits to ponder? The implications of the Black Lives Matter movement reach beyond how police conduct themselves to the question of what we ask police to actually do. Cops say at least 80% to 90% of inner-city crime stems from drugs, and though police know the damage of narcotics better than most-Bologna's brother died of a heroin overdose-what drugs offer is escape from reality and access to a rewarding underground economy. Is it a coincidence they dominate neighborhoods circumscribed as off limits to the American Dream? The FHA for decades forbade mortgage loans to the black neighborhoods that today could pass for what soldiers call a kill box. A more profound reckoning lies ahead, if Americans have the stomach to face it.\n\n\"Basically, we're the wall between the haves and the have-nots, to make sure those over here don't get over there,\" says Linder, nodding. \"And yet,\" he adds, taking things back to the here and now where police are most comfortable, \"in these neighborhoods, there are the 20% who are jerk-offs, and the 80% who are hardworking people. We're the wall for those too.\"\n\nFor their trouble, police officers in America earn $59,000 a year on average, and in major cities like Philly, a veteran on a special squad can earn far more. Police work remains one of the few avenues to a middle-class wage without a university degree. Yet to face what they do every day, most cops need an operating philosophy, beyond the passion for locking up bad guys that drives many rookies and usually fades into something more nuanced over time. In interviews, most spoke of service. \"You don't have to like me,\" Dillard said. \"But I'm still here to help you.\" The sense of calling seems even more essential for black officers, who make up for a slight majority of the squad, not that there was any apparent racial tension in the ranks. Nothing bonds human beings to one another like shared risk.\n\n\"All lives matter,\" says Williams. \"I've been an African-American male longer than I've been a police officer. [But] if I'm working with a partner, his life matters. I want him to go home to his family too.\"\n\nAt midafternoon on a Friday in late July, the 19th station house emptied at the report of a major road accident, a hit-and-run at a red light that had flipped a Chevy Blazer. The first there was Robert McDonnell, a desk officer who happened upon the crash on his way home. Still in his uniform, he pulled himself across the bloodied asphalt into the wreckage and comforted the woman hanging upside down inside. The fire department arrived-\"everyone loves firemen,\" as Bologna says-and within minutes the intersection was crowded with a blend of uniforms and neighbors. Many held their phones in front of them, recording.\n\nA woman named Vanessa Brown walks up and down the line of bystanders, urging them to click off. \"They're not doing anything wrong,\" she says. She introduces herself as a state representative and flips her phone to her Facebook page, where she posts videos purporting police abuse. But that's not what's going on here, she emphasizes. \"They were on the scene immediately,\" she says. \"When they say Philadelphia's Finest, this is Philadelphia's Finest.\"\n\nThe crowd is silent to the point of reverence as the driver is pulled out, and after an ambulance carries her away, people linger. A man points to a security camera on a nearby store, which may have caught the miscreant. Another man approaches McDonnell. \"You the officer who was in there?\" he asks, extending his hand. \"Thank you, sir.\" McDonnell nods. \"Anytime,\" he says.\n\nIt isn't the Amtrak crash or even South Philly. But at least for a moment, it's clear who the bad guy is-the driver of a battered gray minivan, captured as hoped on the store videotape-and something feels different at 52nd and Master Street. \"Can I go to my car?\" asks a woman in a hat, stuck on the wrong side of the yellow tape. \"My car is way over there.\" A lieutenant named O'Brien takes her arm. \"I'll walk you,\" he says.\n\nFirst Person biographies reported by Olivia B. Waxman from New York\n\nAngelo Harris, 37 Senior patrol officer, Hampton, Va.\n\nOn Christmas Day 2001, I got shot in my grandma's front yard. An individual approached me asking if I knew how to get drugs, then a second person came up behind me and tried to reach into my pocket. When the first guy took out a handgun, I turned to run, and that's when I felt the impact near my left knee. My grandparents called the police. The officers were so reassuring. It was remarkable how fast they came up with suspects. It touched me to the point where I wanted to do the same.\n\nNancy Hove, 49 Sheriff, Pierce County, Wisc.\n\nI wanted to be a doctor because I wanted to help people, but couldn't afford the education. When I was 18, I was bartending in Hager City when a detective who'd come into the saloon suggested I go into law enforcement. Since I wanted a job with benefits instead of living paycheck to paycheck, I got my associate degree in criminal justice. I worked as an EMT, a patrol officer, a dispatcher, a jailer, a school liaison officer, and was elected Pierce County sheriff nine years ago. It's old-fashioned up here. People show up at the doorstep of my hobby farm to tell me about an issue.\n\nBryan Shelton, 31 Sergeant, Birmingham, Ala.\n\nGrowing up, my home was burglarized, someone stole my car radio, and at college in Troy, when I was walking to church, a guy pulled out a fingernail file and said, \"Since you're carrying your Bible and you're supposed to be a Christian, how about you give me some money?\" Why do these things happen? Is there a way to stop this stuff? The majority of crimes committed are poor people stealing or committing crimes against other poor people. I wanted to break that cycle.\n\nJuan \"Paco\" Balderrama, 38 Captain, Oklahoma City\n\nMy twin brother and I grew up in a single-parent home in an El Paso, Texas, project. When we were about 7, Mom signed us up for an assistance program where, around Christmas, the police took us downtown and bought us shiny white sneakers. It was a big deal for us. When we moved to Oklahoma City, the campus police officer at our high school made us security personnel at events. We never had a father figure, so for this older man to tell people we were his boys, it inspired me and made me feel like we had a chance to succeed.\n\nChris Goble, 33 Patrol officer, Arvada, Colo.\n\nI was an Army sergeant in combat in Afghanistan. When I came back, I was edgy, nervous, always waiting for something bad to happen. I had great counseling sessions and tried to figure out how to turn my anxiousness from a liability into a tool. That's why I thought about being a cop. There's a certain alertness trained into us that most people don't have. The police academy felt like basic training all over again. It felt like home. Yeah, this fits.\n\nBill Wolf, 57 Police officer, Prescott, Ariz.\n\nI have a Ph.D. in Russian history from Ohio State. I taught history at a community college, but as an adjunct working 50 to 60 hours, my highest yearly income was $11,500. I opened my own landscaping business for two years to make more money, and driving between jobs, I heard on the radio that Prescott was looking for police officers. I was 48 and thought, \"I bet that pays more, and it's respectable.\" Starting off with a low $40,000 salary was a big step up.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "Atlanta Democrats Vote to Fund Controversial Police Training Center\n\nA tlanta's city council voted early Tuesday morning to provide public funding for a controversial law enforcement training facility, cementing an unusual alliance that has formed between local Democrats and state Republicans. With the Democratic mayor, left-leaning city council and state Republicans all backing millions of dollars in taxpayer funds for the private non-profit that is building the center, the facility dubbed \"Cop City\" by opponents is set to take the next step towards construction, local political observers say.\n\nAtlanta's city council voted 11-4 in favor of allocating public funding to the facility after protesters packed the building and gave hours of heated public comment. In 2021, council members voted 10-4 to lease land to the Atlanta Police Foundation but not to provide money. The session began early Monday afternoon and members voted around 5:30 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nMore than 200 people spoke against the facility, saying it would militarize police and cost too much. \"What you're voting on today is a military facility to propose a compound to make a mock city for training in urban warfare tactics,\" said Gary Spencer, senior counsel at the NAACP's Legal Defense Fund. \"The policing promoted by this facility will not make Atlanta safer; in fact, it will put our communities-particularly our Black and brown communities-in significant danger.\"\n\nJust a handful spoke in support of the project.\n\nSupporters, led by Atlanta's Democratic Mayor Andre Dickens, say the center is needed to properly train police and to replace dilapidated existing facilities.  Last week, during his official state of the city address, Dickens argued that police training was key to reducing crime. \"We need training facilities, and our police and fire training centers have been long condemned. That's why we are building the state-of-the-art Atlanta Public Safety Training Center.\"\n\nThe approval of local funding for the center is a blow to progressive protesters who have argued that it would empower police violence. Atlanta City Councilwoman Keisha Sean Waites voted no, even though she believes the state needs a new public safety training facility and supports law enforcement. She says the facility lacks community support and has a higher price tag than was initially stated. \"There is no way in the world we should be supporting a measure that does not have the pulse of those people who sent us down here to represent their voice,\" Waites says. \"What I don't understand is why there is this immediate need and urgency to do this. There is no reason why we have to do this on Monday.\"\n\nThe months leading up to the funding vote have been tense. In January, police shot protester Manuel \"Tortuguita\" Terán 57 times, according to an official autopsy. Nearly 300 people spoke against the training center at a May 15 city council meeting; public comment lasted more than 7 hours. Taxpayers learned they will actually be paying close to $67 million to help build the facility-more than double the initial announced cost, as first reported by the Atlanta Community Press Collective . About $31 million in public money will be used to fund the site's construction. The city will also pay $36 million over 30 years for using the 300 acres of forested land, which it leased to the Atlanta Police Foundation for $10 a year.\n\nOn Friday, lawyers for a 'Cop City' protester sued over the use of a state domestic terrorism charge in a case stemming from the protests, the Guardian reported. Last Wednesday, the Georgia Bureau of Investigations announced that it had arrested three members of a bail fund on charges of money laundering and charity fraud. The Atlanta Solidarity Fund had been providing financial relief for protesters, many of whom had been charged under domestic terrorism laws . Bond has since been granted for the three activists; a judge said he did not currently find the prosecution's case \" real impressive \" after expressing concerns about their free speech rights.\n\n'Cop City' critics and some attorneys and lawmakers fear that the charges against bail fund members are intended to chill protests and those who support them. State Sen. Josh McLaurin said he is concerned about the misuse of state resources. \"The broad brush that was used to paint a large group of protesters as domestic terrorists months ago is now being further deployed to extend the reach of the criminal legal system to more people, even further out,\" McLaurin says.\n\nAttorney General Chris Carr has said authorities \"will not rest until we have held accountable every person who has funded, organized, or participated in this violence and intimidation.\"\n\nPublic resistance has not been enough to change the political reality in Atlanta, as the city council has backed funding for the facility. Atlanta City Councilman Michael Bond voted yes for the center. He says current training facilities are \"dilapidated.\" \"It's not just something that is glitzy and glamorous...that we want to do to appease the 'police state,'\" he says. \"This is a real necessity for our city and it affects the recidivism rate in the police and fire department and harms recruiting the best and brightest.\" Bond says that he condemns the death of the protester, as well as the raid of the bail fund.\n\nWhile public hearings have largely showcased critics of the facility, a March survey by Emory University professors suggest that the views of Atlanta residents are mixed. Overall, 48% supported the training center, 46% opposed it and about 6% were not sure. However, the survey also reveals a racial disparity. \"If you go into the more affluent northern parts of the city, like Buckhead, there are much higher levels of support, compared to lower income, more heavily Black neighborhoods in the southern part of the city,\" says Zachary Peskowitz, associate professor at Emory University-one of the two people who conducted the study.\n\nInterest in the facility increased when homicides spiked in 2020 and a concerned business community started to work with Atlanta's mayor and city council to try and decrease crime, Peskowitz says. There has also been an active movement for the majority-white and affluent neighborhood of Buckhead to secede from the rest of Atlanta . \"That concern may definitely have led some political leaders to be more enthusiastic about this facility,\" he says. \"Part of the motivation for this facility is to assuage corporate concerns about crime in the city-to say, here's a concrete thing that we're going to do to increase public safety.\" For decades, left-leaning Black political leaders and business elites in Atlanta have shared a strong relationship, he adds.\n\nFor Michael Leo Owens, the second Emory professor who worked on the survey, any claims that the new facility will definitely increase or decrease public safety is \"speculation.\"\n\nAtlanta has always had pro-police leanings, even among its Democrats, Owens says; it often defers to its more affluent population. \"The 'Atlanta Way' is to exceedingly accede to the values, preferences, and wishes of its foremost commercial and philanthropic elites, both those based in and those based beyond the city's limits,\" Owens says.\n\nStill, many left-leaning Democrats and 'Cop City' critics feel betrayed by the city's stance on the project. \"In every other space, these two factions claim to strongly dislike each others' politics but they agree on the repression of protest,\" says Tiffany Roberts, policy director at Southern Center for Human Rights, which is helping connect protesters with legal representation. \"It all comes down to a so-called progressive man wielding conservative politics.\"\n\nWrite to Sanya Mansoor at sanya.mansoor@time.com"

      "text": "Georgia Is Using a Domestic Terrorism Law Expanded After Dylann Roof Against 'Cop City' Protesters\n\nI n 2017, mostly Republican lawmakers expanded Georgia's domestic terrorism law in the aftermath of Dylann Roof's massacre at a Black church in neighboring South Carolina. Now, the law's new provisions are being used in prosecutions for the first time-against protesters fighting to halt the state's proposed new police training center.\n\n\"Using the domestic terrorism statute against individuals who are protesting-I mean, that obviously has a chilling effect on free speech,\" says Jenn Hyman, an attorney at Arora Law, which is representing three people charged in the so-called 'Cop City' protests. \"There are other charges that could be used-other types of crimes that could be charged instead of domestic terrorism-but by putting the label of domestic terrorist, it's painting people with certain political views in this dangerous, evil light.\"\n\nAtlanta's plan to build a $90 million police and fire training center stretching 85-acres across an urban forest has sparked outrage and controversy, leading some protesters to camp out for weeks at the site and set a police car on fire after law enforcement fatally shot a young activist. Law enforcement has charged more than 40 protesters with domestic terrorism over the last few months in the demonstrations against 'Cop City.' Legal experts and local attorneys say this is the first time Georgia's domestic terrorism law has been used in this way; on Wednesday, the first round of preliminary hearings began for a handful of those facing these charges.\n\nThe 'Cop City' cases in Georgia underscore the complicated legal questions about how to effectively prosecute domestic terror in the United States, and who should be considered a domestic terrorist under the law. After numerous incidents of homegrown violence in recent years-from Roof to the 2018 attack at Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue to the 2019 El Paso massacre -calls for tougher domestic terrorism laws mounted to combat white supremacist violence. But as states like Georgia strengthened their laws in response, some worried that the statutes had become too broad, and could be used to repress protests and other forms of civil disobedience.\n\n\"This is not about just arresting people who were engaged in certain types of action. This is about criminalizing the movement,\" says Kamau Franklin, founder of an Atlanta-based non-profit organization, Community Movement Builders, which has been part of the 'Cop City' protests.\n\nIn its 2017 expansion, Georgia no longer limited domestic terrorism to criminalized acts intended to or reasonably likely to kill or injure at least 10 people; the newer version of the law included some property crimes intended to change government policy through intimidation or coercion. Republican state sen. Bill Cowsert helped usher the law through Georgia's legislature five years ago. He says the law protects critical infrastructure, including law enforcement facilities and property. \"That's out of bounds. You shouldn't be attacking schools, hospitals, police stations, fire stations,\" Cowsert says.\n\nNo domestic terrorism law exists at the federal level despite pressure on the Biden Administration to enforce one , so states are leading on the issue. Some states-including Georgia-have taken the definition of terrorism at the federal level and turned it into a crime state prosecutors can charge. Frank Figliuzzi, the FBI's former counterintelligence director, told TIME last year that without more explicit federal laws, the Justice Department's efforts to tackle white supremacy could end up being \"administrative window dressing.\"\n\nBut more than 150 civil rights groups, including the ACLU, wrote to Congress last year about the dangers of passing such a law because it could penalize people of color. Branding acts as domestic terrorism can delegitimize protest and ratchet up criminal penalties, says Shirin Sinnar, a law professor at Stanford University. (In Georgia's case, the law entails a prison sentence of up to 35 years for some property crimes.)\n\nProtesters in Atlanta fear the new training facility will empower police violence, partly because it includes a 'mock city' for officers to try out urban warfare tactics and practice raids. Some environmentalists say the project is an affront to Atlanta's urban woodland. 'Cop City' critics have accused police of responding violently and using extreme charges to chill protest: an independent autopsy found that law enforcement fired 57 times when they killed 26-year-old protester Manuel \"Tortuguita\" Terán . Defenders of the facility argue it's necessary to better train police, particularly to respond to situations such as shootings and robberies. \"Some of these same people protesting against law enforcement's excessive use of force... ought to be the people that most want us to properly train law enforcement so that they will be respectful of citizens,\" says Cowsert.\n\nAfter months of simmering tension around the site, a music festival and bad weather precipitated a crackdown on the protesters. Many of the activists charged with domestic terrorism attended a music festival protesting 'Cop City' in the forest on March 5, two days after a rainstorm. Law enforcement raided the event after dozens of people in black masks attacked the site of the proposed training center. Many arrest warrants said demonstrators had the phone number for a bail fund written on their body or on their clothes. Warrants also cited their muddy, black, or camouflage clothing. Law enforcement claims a group of 50-100 people \"criminally trespassed on marked land, walked approximately half a mile in the forest, and began to assault Atlanta Police Department Officers and Georgia State Patrol Troopers with rocks, fireworks, and Molotov cocktails.\"\n\nAttorneys for protesters pushed back, arguing that police made blanket arrests-without probable cause-at the music festival. \"I don't think these prosecutors or these cops have ever had the benefit and joy of going to a music festival... and gotten muddy,\" says attorney Suri Chadha Jiminez. (His client, 18-year-old Ayla King, was charged with domestic terrorism after attending the music festival.)\n\nAttorney Matt Bass, who represents three protesters arrested the day of the music festival, says the domestic terrorism charges are politically motivated, intended to win over conservative voters with a tough-on-crime approach. \"Tons of protests happen around the country where a few people do something wrong,\" Bass says. \"That doesn't make the people who were there participating in the protest guilty.\"\n\nDomestic terrorism charges can also make it more difficult to get bail. (Only one person arrested in relation to 'Cop City' protests received bail upon first appearance, although many more protesters did at subsequent court hearings.) \"The judges at first appearance are not only saying we can see how there's probable cause but they're also saying-you're so dangerous, we can't even give you a bail amount,\" says Tiffany Roberts, policy director at Southern Center for Human Rights, which is helping connect protesters with legal representation. Some bail amounts have been higher than $300,000, according to Marlon Kautz, an organizer with the Atlanta Solidarity Fund, which provides arrested protesters with bail. Cowsert, the state senator, insists that nothing prevents reasonable bond from being set: \"That is a decision that each judge makes on each case.\"\n\nThe 'Cop City' cases are critical tests as the nation wrestles with how to keep its citizens safe in the face of rising domestic terror-without entangling other types of crimes or legitimate forms of protest in the terrorism net. \"People become worried because the prosecution is effectively broadcasting that you're going to target people not just because of the crimes that they did but because of their political association,\" Kautz says. \"If you call something terrorism, it makes it fundamentally illegitimate.\"\n\nWrite to Sanya Mansoor at sanya.mansoor@time.com"

      "text": "What to Know About the Clashes at 'Cop City,' Atlanta's Planned Police Training Center\n\nH undreds of protesters on Sunday breached the site of a proposed public safety training facility in southeast Atlanta, burning construction vehicles and setting off fireworks at police officers. The Atlanta Police Department said 23 people had been arrested and charged with domestic terrorism after throwing bricks, rocks and Molotov cocktails at officers stationed nearby.\n\nThe violent clashes occurred on the second day of what activists are calling a weeklong \"mass mobilization\" to protest the building of the Atlanta Public Safety Training Center, a planned 85-acre campus that has been branded \"Cop City\" by opponents who say the complex would propagate police militarization and harm the environment.\n\n\"We are appalled because no one asked for this facility to be built,\" activist Kamau Franklin, the founder of Community Movement Builders , a grassroots organizing group that helped organize the 'Stop Cop City' movement, tells TIME. \"This is a militarized police facility that's going to have over a dozen firing ranges and a Blackhawk helicopter. I can't think of any reason whatsoever why the police in Atlanta need a Blackhawk helicopter, except to over-police Black communities.\"\n\nSurveillance footage from Atlanta Police captured construction equipment burning out of control at the site as protesters in black clothing went into the fenced construction area before squad cars and armed officers arrived. The protesters were seen throwing large rocks, bricks, molotov cocktails, and fireworks at police officers. No officers were hurt.\n\n\"A group of violent agitators used the cover of a peaceful protest of the proposed Atlanta Public Safety Training Center to conduct a coordinated attack on construction equipment and police officers,\" the police department said.\n\nPolice said they \"exercised restraint and used nonlethal enforcement\" to detain 35 people. Of those detained, 23 were arrested and have been charged with domestic terrorism by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, according to a Monday afternoon update. Only two of the individuals arrested are from Georgia; one is from Canada and another is from France.\n\nTensions over the proposed police training facility have escalated between law enforcement and protesters in recent months. Those opposed to the center began organizing against the complex shortly after the Atlanta City Council authorized it in 2021. Franklin says the announcement came as a surprise to local residents and that the development process has been largely secretive, with limited input from those most directly impacted.\n\nEnvironmental advocates want to preserve the wooded area, which spans more than 1,000 acres. The planned center, located in DeKalb County, is estimated to cost $90 million, funded mostly by the Atlanta Police Foundation, a nonprofit organization, as a way to offer better police training and to boost morale amid hiring and retention struggles. Taxpayers will fund about $30 million of the facility's cost. The city has said that it would replace trees cleared during construction, and protect more than 200 acres of land around the facility.\n\nOther activists are concerned that the development of the training site will enable increased militarization of police forces in DeKalb County, which is 55% Black. Attention towards policing practices heightened in the wake of monthslong demonstrations against police brutality and racial injustice after the 2020 police killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Rayshard Brooks.\n\nAtlanta's Democratic Mayor Andre Dickens, who is Black, said at a press conference in late January that the proposed training facility would help address much of the concerns about harmful policing practices. \"Our training includes vital areas like de-escalation training techniques, mental health, community-oriented policing, crisis intervention training, as well as civil rights history education,\" he said. \"This training needs space, and that's exactly what this training center is going to offer.\"\n\nMore than 85% of the people arrested by the Atlanta Police Department are Black, compared to the city's 48% Black population, according to data from the Police Scorecard , an online database of police violence and racial bias for over 16,000 law enforcement agencies.\n\nFranklin, who helped organize the movement, says the problems with policing in Atlanta aren't just an issue with inadequate training-but rather an issue of \"militarizing the police to look at certain communities as criminals, particularly Black, poor, working-class communities.\" He added that police have been bringing tanks and armored vehicles to protect the forest, along with officers carrying long rifles to patrol the site. \"I don't buy whatsoever that this is about training the police,\" Franklin says. \"The only training that's going to happen is on how to further criminalize communities of color, and how to continue to stop movements from taking place.\"\n\nViolent protests related to the proposed police training facility last erupted in Atlanta on Jan. 21, when a police vehicle was set on fire and windows were shattered in downtown buildings after the fatal police shooting of Manuel Esteban Paez Teran, a 26-year-old social justice activist who was protesting the proposed site. Police said he opened fire first, injuring a state trooper; activists have called for an independent investigation into the shooting.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, declared a state of emergency on Jan. 26 and called for the mobilization of 1,000 National Guard troops amid simmering tensions over the training facility. Some arrested at the site were previously charged with domestic terrorism.\n\nThe planned demonstrations this weekend began peacefully on Saturday with a rally, a march through the South River Forest, and a music and arts festival.\n\nFranklin says he didn't expect Sunday's protest to turn violent, though he added that officers had pepper sprayed people and tossed protesters to the ground during the clash. \"Some folks even had their lives threatened by police officers,\" he says. \"That is what I consider violence. The destruction of property may be something that people don't like to see, but they are not violent attacks.\" Atlanta Police did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\n\"I think it was an overreaction by the police to go and bust up the music festival and arrest 35 people and charge 23 of them with acts of domestic terrorism-folks who were at the Music Festival that were randomly picked out and not necessarily part of the action,\" he added.\n\nThose who oppose the police facility say the city of Atlanta should instead reallocate the roughly $30 million in taxpayer funding towards other issues, like affordable housing, accessible healthcare or work programs, Franklin says.\n\nWrite to Nik Popli at nik.popli@time.com"

He's based in Green Bay, Wisc. and started his skating patrols in March-already, they've been a huge success.

      "text": "Some Experts Say COPs Are 'Distracting' and Need Fixing\n\nThis story was originally published by Grist .\n\nDiplomats, academics, and activists from around the globe will gather yet again this week to try to find common ground on a plan for combating climate change. This year's COP, as the event is known, marks the 28th annual meeting of the conference of the parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. More than 70,000 people are expected to descend on Dubai for the occasion.\n\nIn addition to marathon negotiations and heated discussions, the fortnight-long assembly will see all manner of marches, rallies, speakers, advocacy, and lobbying. But, aside from fanfare, it remains unclear how much COP28 will, or can, achieve. While there have been signs that the United States and China could deepen their decarbonization commitments , countries have struggled to decide how to compensate developing countries for climate-related losses . Meanwhile, global emissions and temperatures continue climbing at an alarming rate.\n\nThat has left some to wonder: Have these annual gatherings outlived their usefulness?\n\nTo some, the yearly get-togethers continue to be a critical centerpiece for international climate action, and any tweaks they might need lie mostly around the edges. \"They aren't perfect,\" said Tom Evans, a policy analyst for the nonprofit climate change think tank E3G. \"[But] they are still important and useful.\" While he sees room for improvements - such as greater continuity between COP summits and ensuring ministerial meetings are more substantive - he supports the overall format. \"We need to try and find a way to kind of invigorate and revitalize without distracting from the negotiations, which are key.\"\n\nOthers say the summits no longer sufficiently meet the moment. \"The job in hand has changed over the years,\" said Rachel Kyte, a climate diplomacy expert and dean emerita of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. She is among those who believe the annual COP needs to evolve. \"Form should follow function,\" she said. \"And we are using an old form.\"\n\nDurwood Zaelke, co-founder and former president of the Center for International Environmental Law, was more blunt. \"You can't say that an agreement that lets a problem grow into an emergency is doing a good job,\" he said. \"It's not.\"\n\nEstablished in 1992, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is an international treaty that aims to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions and avoid the worst effects of climate change. Some 198 countries have ratified the Convention, which has seen some significant wins.\n\nThe 1997 Kyoto Protocol marked the first major breakthrough, and helped propel international action toward reducing emissions - though only some of the commitments are binding, and the United States is notably absent from the list signatories. The 2015 Paris Agreement laid out an even more robust roadmap for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, with a target of holding global temperature rise to \"well below\" 2°C (3.6°F) above preindustrial levels, and \" pursuing efforts \" to limit the increase to 1.5°C (2.7°F).\n\nAlthough the path to that future is narrowing, it is still within reach, according to the International Energy Agency . But, some experts say, relying primarily on once-a-year COP meetings to get there may no longer be the best approach.\n\n\"Multilateral engagement is not the issue anymore,\" Christiana Figueres said at a conference earlier this year . She was the executive secretary of the Convention when the Paris agreement was reached, and said that while important issues that need to be ironed out on the international level - especially for developing countries - the hardest work must now be done domestically.\n\n\"We have to redesign the COPs.... Multilateral attention, frankly, is distracting governments from doing their homework at home,\" she said. At another conference a month later, she added, \"Honestly, I would prefer 90,000 people stay at home and do their job.\"\n\nKyte agrees and thinks it's time to take at least a step back from festival-like gatherings and toward more focused, year-round, work on the crisis at hand. \"The UN has to find a way to break us into working groups to get things done,\" she said. \"And then work us back together into less of a jamboree and more of a somber working event.\"\n\nThe list of potential topics for working groups to tackle is long, from ensuring a just transition to reigning in the use of coal. But one area that Zaelke points to as a possible exemplar for a sectoral approach is reducing emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas with more than 80 times the warming power of carbon dioxide in the first 20 years after it reaches the atmosphere.\n\n\"Methane is the blow torch that's pushing us from global warming to global boiling,\" he said. \"It's the single biggest and fastest way to turn down the heat.\"\n\nTo tackle the methane problem, Zaelke points to another international agreement as a model: the Montreal Protocol. Adopted in 1987, that treaty was aimed at regulating chemicals that deplete the atmosphere's ozone layer, and it has been a resounding success. The pollutants have been almost completely phased out and the ozone layer is on track to recover by the middle of the century. The compact was expanded in 2016 to include another class of chemicals, hydrochlorofluorocarbons.\n\n\"It's an under-appreciated treaty, and it's an under-appreciated model,\" said Zaelke, noting that it included legally binding measures that the Paris agreement does not. \"You could easily come to the conclusion we need another sectoral agreement for methane.\"\n\nZaelke could see this tactic applying to other sectors as well, such as shipping and agriculture. Some advocates - including at least eight governments and the World Health Organisation - have also called for a \"Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty\", said Harjeet Singh, the global engagement director for the initiative. Like Zaelke, Kyte, and others, he envisions such sectoral pushes as running complementary to the main Convention process - a framework that, while flawed, he believes can continue to play an important role.\n\n\"The amount of time we spend negotiating each and every paragraph, line, comma, semicolon is just unimaginable and a colossal waste of time,\" he said of the annual events. But he adds the forum is still crucial, in part because every country enjoys an equal amount of voting power, no matter its size or clout.\n\n\"I don't see any other space which is as powerful as this to deliver climate justice,\" he said. \"We need more tools and more processes, but we cannot lose the space.\"\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

The streaming giant released a new trailer for the movie on Thursday, in which he's seen arrested for operating (and crashing) a stolen helicopter and using unorthodox practices while undercover.\n\n\"This is very embarrassing,\" Foley says in the trailer as police usher him into a squad car. \"Part of me would rather get locked up than get put in this little Fisher-Price looking squad car. Y'all are the LEGO cops.\"\n\nThe film follows Murphy's Detroit detective, who heads back to Beverly Hills when his daughter ( Taylour Paige ) is threatened, teaming up with a new partner (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and his old pals (Judge Reinhold and John Ashton) to uncover a conspiracy.\n\n\"You're pissing off a lot of people,\" one detective tells Foley, to which he responds, \"That means we're getting close.\"\n\nThe first \"Beverly Hills Cop,\" released in 1984, was a big-screen breakthrough for Murphy, who had shot to success on \"Saturday Night Live.\" The film was a critical and box-office hit, netting more than $316 million worldwide and earning an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay.\n\nThe sequels, released in 1987 and 1994, saw diminishing returns. But Murphy persisted in developing a fourth movie for nearly 30 years, which cycled through numerous directors including the now-disgraced Brett Ratner . Mark Molloy, making his film directorial debut, was eventually selected for the job.\n\n\"You've got one of the greatest comedians, if not in my eyes, the greatest comedian in the world,\" Molloy recently told Entertainment Weekly . \"A huge part of my job is to create a space for improvisation to thrive. I always want to get what's on the page, but when you have someone like Eddie Murphy, you want to let him be free. And as I look back on the film, some of the funniest moments in the film is when Eddie is improvising.\"\n\nMurphy, 63, has been keeping busy: The Oscar-nominated \"Dreamgirls\" actor appeared in the streaming comedies \" Candy Cane Lane \" and \"You People\" last year, and has also been in talks to lead a new \"Pink Panther\" movie.\n\nLooking for reliable options to stream \"Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F\" on Netflix?

      "text": "What's next for ex-Columbus cop Andrew Mitchell after not guilty verdict in murder trial?\n\nAfter about five hours of deliberation on Tuesday, a Franklin County jury determined that a former Columbus police vice officer was not guilty of murder and voluntary manslaughter in connection with the fatal shooting of a 23-year-old woman in August 2018.\n\nAfter the verdict, the family of 23-year-old Donna Dalton Castleberry said they felt like the verdict in the case against former Columbus police officer Andrew Mitchell was a \"miscarriage of justice\" and they were devastated by the news.\n\n\"We thought the prosecutors did a really good job proving the kind of cop he was on that day in August,\" Castleberry's sister, Bobbi McCalla, said. \"She was the victim here.\"\n\nAnd while Mitchell is no longer facing murder charges, he will be back before a judge in about three months to answer for multiple charges filed against him in U.S. District Court.\n\nMitchell will remain in police custody. He faces nine federal charges after being accused of forcing women to perform sexual acts in exchange for their freedom and lying to federal investigators, among other accusations. Trial in that case is scheduled to begin in July 2023.\n\nBecause it would have been prejudicial to Mitchell, the information about the federal charges pending against Mitchell could not be brought before the jury in the Castleberry case in county Common Pleas Court.\n\nMitchell's attorney, Mark Collins, said there may be developments in whether there may be a motion to revisit Mitchell's detention in the federal case in the coming weeks.\n\nMitchell was indicted in 2019 on charges of deprivation of rights under color of law, essentially meaning misusing his police authority and taking away someone's rights. Those accusations are related to two women who told investigators that in 2017 Mitchell had forced them to perform sexual acts in exchange for not arresting them.\n\nIn documents connected to the federal case that were unsealed earlier this year, both women told investigators Mitchell had identified himself as a police officer when he picked them up while they were sex workers on the West Side . Mitchell asked each woman if they had active warrants for their arrest.\n\nMitchell also faces charges of witness tampering, obstruction of justice and lying to FBI agents about whether he had ever engaged in sexual activity with a prostitute.\n\nThe unsealed court documents revealed federal investigators had used cellphone tracking on Mitchell's personal phone, a suspected burner phone he was using and another cellphone belonging to an unidentified third party Mitchell was alleged to have asked to reach out to possible witnesses on his behalf. The affidavit details that Mitchell's cellphone was at the homes of several witnesses or relatives of witnesses while the investigation was taking place.\n\nIn one instance, Mitchell's cellphone was at the location a witness had been dropped off at by investigators after that witness admitted to speaking with Mitchell the previous day, refused to testify before a federal grand jury and asked for a lawyer. Mitchell's cellphone was at the location within two hours of the witness being dropped off by federal investigators.\n\nAt least two other witnesses told investigators and a federal grand jury that Mitchell had spoken with them prior to their interviews, encouraging them to tell the truth but leave out that Mitchell had paid them for performing sexual acts, according to the affidavit.\n\nThe federal charges do not relate to Castleberry's death, however, the investigation into Mitchell by federal authorities began while Mitchell was on paid leave after the shooting took place.\n\nCastleberry's family said they were heartbroken and devastated by the verdict and felt justice had been denied for the 23-year-old, her family and her two children.\n\nMcCalla said the family remains hopeful that the federal case will result in a lengthy prison sentence for Mitchell to ensure \"not only the safety of the women on the streets but for our family as well.\"\n\nCollins said Mitchell's family was \"overwhelmed\" by the jury's decision and happy to see what they considered justice done in the case. He said the jury had a tough task, listening to Castleberry's final moments on audio, but did a nearly impossible task of setting aside sympathy and empathy.\n\n\"(Mitchell) had a lawful right to use force,\" Collins said.\n\nBrian Steel, executive vice president of Fraternal Order of Police Capital City Lodge No. 9, which represents Columbus police and other Franklin County law enforcement officers, said in a statement Mitchell's decision to shoot Castleberry after being severely injured and choked was justified, and that the former vice officer \"should have never been charged.\"\n\nSteel said 10 out of 12 jurors at the first trial in April 2022 - which ended in a mistrial after the jury could not reach a unanimous decision - voted not to convict. \"Yet the prosecution decided to waste more taxpayers' funds on another trial that would not result in a conviction,\" he said.\n\nA note from the jury in Mitchell's first trial indicated that seven jurors were leaning towards a not guilty verdict, two were leaning towards a conviction and three were torn.\n\n\"This was nothing short of a political persecution,\" Steel said, \"and we are grateful to the jury for coming to the correct and just verdict and not being influenced by political agendas.\"\n\nFranklin County prosecutors declined comment after the verdict.\n\nMitchell was working undercover in plain clothes and was in an unmarked Mitsubishi Galant on Aug. 23, 2018, when he picked up Castleberry along Sullivant Avenue on the city's West Side.\n\nHe drove to an apartment building on South Yale Avenue, parking the Galant with the passenger side of the car against the building and with the child locks engaged, trapping Castleberry inside the vehicle. Mitchell then told Castleberry she was under arrest, but did not have his police badge or radio, both of which Castleberry asked to see as proof of his identity.\n\nMitchell showed Castleberry his plastic police ID, some blank paperwork and his handcuffs, he testified during trial. A scuffle between Castleberry and Mitchell in the front seat of the Galant led to Mitchell being cut on the hand and what he says was an attempt by Castleberry to choke him with her foot.\n\nMitchell ultimately fired six shots, until his gun jammed, with three of them hitting Castleberry. She died at OhioHealth Grant Medical Center a short time later.\n\nHe faced charges of murder and voluntary manslaughter in connection with Castleberry's death. Under Ohio law, the jury could only find Mitchell guilty of one of the charges if they chose to convict.\n\nThe jury in Mitchell's case heard evidence over about five days before beginning their deliberations Tuesday morning. The evidence included testimony from two use-of-force experts and from Mitchell himself .\n\nThe jury also heard an audio recording of the encounter, which was synced with video from the apartment building, during trial. The recording, which Mitchell made on his city-issued cell phone, captured the entire incident.\n\nbbruner@dispatch.com\n\n@bethany_bruner"

      "text": "A black officer tells his story in 'Once Upon a Cop'\n\nAs the spotlight on law enforcement grows ever harsher, from the sex scandal roiling the Oakland Police Department to the corruption web enveloping the NYPD to the numbing tick-tock of black men killed by the police, the perspective of a top cop - a black cop - makes one sit up and take notice.\n\nIn his memoir Once A Cop (Atria, 308 pp., *** out of four stars), Corey Pegues, who rose to deputy inspector in the New York Police Department before leaving the force in 2013, gives us an incisive look at life on both sides of the blue line.\n\nPegues has straddled multiple worlds since he was a child growing up in Queens. He was a teenage crack dealer who was also a popular high school basketball player. As a police officer, he felt a connection to the residents of the underprivileged communities he often patrolled, unlike many of his peers. He was a black man who endured racism and resentment from some white officers, but enjoyed the friendship and respect of more than a few as well.\n\n3rd Oakland police chief in eight days quits amid sex, race scandals\n\nThat duality gives Pegues a nuanced perspective of the often-fractious relationship between communities of color and law enforcement. He feels, for instance, that New York's controversial stop-question-and-frisk policy could be useful, but was abused as a result of political pressure. He believes most officers want to do a good job and get home safely rather than engage in confrontation.\n\nYet Pegues also recounts his own feelings of powerlessness when he was a rookie manning a police rally, and watched some of his fellow officers topple barricades and aim racial epithets at David Dinkins, New York's first black mayor. \"Police can't police police,'' he writes of the memory.\n\nApart from the most publicized instances of police brutality,  \"the real problem, the real frustration, is the day to day,'' he says. \"There's an arrogance about the way a lot of cops treat minorities.'' And Pegues reveals his own complicated relationship with the NYPD. Saying he was harassed because of his activism, Pegues filed suit against the department, The New York Post and Nassau County for race discrimination, defamation and other allegations.\n\nOnce A Cop is not all police work. There are riveting glimpses of a different sort, as Pegues reminisces about the golden age of hip-hop in Queens, home to Run DMC, LL Cool J and other rap luminaries in all their Kangol-wearing glory. Those vignettes are fleeting. There could have been more.\n\nBut perhaps Pegues felt at this moment in America it was more important to relay his experiences wearing a badge. To that end, his example is a somewhat hopeful one.\n\nWhen Pegues became a lieutenant, he forbade his officers from sending those arrested for offenses such as turnstile jumping to central booking simply because they did not have an I.D. - an act that was not a crime, but because of the booking process led to arrest records for people who were often young, black or brown.\n\nHe wanted to protect as well as serve. \"The power not to arrest someone,'' he writes. \"That power lies 100% with the police officer - and that's a lot of power for one person to have.''"

      "text": "'Beverly Hills Cop' at 35: 'Breaking Bad's Jonathan Banks faced off with Eddie Murphy\n\nNo one does simmering menace like \"Breaking Bad\" and \"Better Call Saul\" star Jonathan Banks, who showed off the skill 35 years ago as the thug Zack opposite Eddie Murphy's Axel Foley in 1984's \"Beverly Hills Cop.\"\n\nThe scene where Murphy' s Detroit cop bluffs his way into crime boss Victor Maitland's office shows the stone-faced Zack thumbing through a magazine in a nearby armchair.\n\nZack watches Foley with perfect stillness, his eyes doing most of the moving, even as six burly security guards materialize to literally throw Foley out of the office.\n\nAs \"Beverly Hills Cop\" turns 35 (debuting in 4K on digital on Dec. 17) Banks recalls shooting the scene. \"Director Marty Brest said to me, 'I think you should give me a little more as far as looks,' \" he says. \"And I said, 'Marty, I'll do it. But when you look at those takes, I think you're going to see I gave enough.' \"\n\n\"And it was one of those times when Marty came back to me and said, 'You're right. That was enough,' \" Banks adds.\n\nTwenty-five years later, the actor would immortally infuse those same subtly powerful qualities into fixer Mike Ehrmantraut for his five-time Emmy nominated role in TV's \"Breaking Bad\" and \"Better Call Saul.\"\n\n\"It's one of those things, less is more,\" says Banks, 72. \"Most of the mistakes I've made in my career onscreen are because, if I were to judge it, I did too much.\"\n\nBanks experienced Murphy's meteoric film rise up close, appearing with the \"Saturday Night Live\" phenom as doomed Detective Algren in the 1982 dramatic comedy \"48 Hrs.\" and then \"Beverly Hills Cop\" two years later. The tough-guy actor even really clipped the young comedian during one thug scene for realism.\n\n\"I remember slapping Eddie in the head and he said, 'I'm making too much money to be doing this.' \" Banks recalls with a chuckle. \"I was like, 'No, no you're not.' And I slapped him one more time. But this was a young Eddie Murphy, who was so bright and watching and learning. He watched everything.\"\n\nMurphy returned the favor during a posh restaurant scene when Foley interrupts Maitland over lunch and tosses Zack over an impressive food table. The irate Zack emerges with salad on his head. Banks says he was young and game enough to allow Murphy to toss him for two takes.\n\n\"It was the hottest day in Pasadena, the seafood was especially rotten, so they had sprayed all the food with bug spray for the flies,\" says Banks. \"When you got that toxic stuff on you, it was a nasty business.\"\n\nNot able to perfect the full flight over the table, Banks passed the stunt onto professional stuntman Luis Miguel Arranz, who nailed the maneuver.\n\nThe revered stuntman did his best to convince Banks not to perform another \"Cop\" stunt, Zack's death scene . When Foley aims and shoots in their final meeting,  Zack - wide-eyed calm even in his final moment - meets his end falling through a glass case.\n\n\"Luis said to me, 'You don't have to do this (fall). I said, 'Nah, I can do this. It's all sugar glass,' What I didn't realize was that the cabinet had a real oak frame,\" Banks recalls.\n\nSure enough, Banks fell through the glass perfectly and then split his head open on the wood. The bleeding wound required a trip to the emergency room to shave the back of his head (\"I had hair then,\" he says) and stitches. Banks returned and finished the scene that day, the last day of filming.\n\nHe still laughs about the memorable moment.\n\n\"I remember getting half knocked out. And the first person looking over me was Luis,\" says Banks. \"He wasn't like 'Are you all right?' He looked at me and said, 'I told you that you didn't have to do that scene.'\""

      "text": "Cast of original 'Beverly Hills Cop' movie is back for 'Axel F': Where were they?\n\nAs movie cast reunions go, few will generate more nostalgic laughs than the one assembled for \"Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F.\"\n\nThe fourth installment in the franchise ( streaming now on Netflix ) comes 40 years after the original Eddie Murphy launch pad, and 30 years after the third movie in the series.\n\nBut John Landis' 1994 film \"Beverly Hills Cop III\" fared less well at the box office than its predecessors and noticeably excluded a few key players, including John Ashton as the lovable but tough cop John Taggart and Paul Reiser as affable detective Jeffrey Friedman.\n\nThis time, the core \"Cop\" team is back, including Ashton and Reiser, as well as Bronson Pinchot as art dealer Serge. A few newcomers to Murphy's humor-meets-mayhem camp include Taylour Paige as his daughter Jane, Kevin Bacon as Captain Grant, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as cop Bobby Abbott.\n\n\"We had done three 'Beverly Hills Cop' movies, but the third one is a little soft compared to the other two, and it's because we don't have all of the people from the original,\" Murphy tells USA TODAY.\n\n\"Now, we're back with John back as Taggart, we've got Paul, we've got Bronson, you just needed all the ingredients that were in the first picture,\" he says. \"Everyone who was alive - well, except for Lisa Eilbacher (she played Axel's sleuthing pal Jenny), who is very much still alive - but everyone else, we brought them back. And it was so good to be back on set with them.\"\n\nWe take a quick look at what some of those original \"Cop\" cast members have been up to over the decades:\n\nMurphy's huge success with \"Beverly Hills Cop\" was followed by a steady string of movies with mixed box-office results, including \"The Golden Child\" and \"Another 48 Hrs.\"\n\nBut in 1988, Murphy found his comedic grove again, teaming up with pal Arsenio Hall for \"Coming to America,\" a premise he'd return to in 2021's \"Coming 2 America.\" He played multiple characters, a nod to his idol Peter Sellers, and would again showcase his chameleon talents in 1996's \"The Nutty Professor.\"\n\nThe 63-year-old star's resume is too lengthy and diverse to summarize. Suffice to say, he's recorded albums as a vocalist, created two classic stand-up specials (\"Delirious\" and \"Raw\"), made voicing a donkey cool (\"Shrek\"), won a Primetime Emmy for his \"Saturday Night Live\" hosting return, was given the Mark Twain Prize for humor , and is the proud father of 10 children.\n\nReinhold, 67, rocketed to fame on the heels of his likable if befuddled police officer in \"Beverly Hills Cop,\" boasting a pal-next-door appeal that would later be claimed by actors such as Jason Segel. While Reinhold tried to parlay that success into leading roles, his movie \"Vice Versa\" was a flop . Reinhold returned to his supporting role niche, both in the \"Cop\" sequels and the Tim Allen star vehicle series \"The Santa Clause.\"\n\nMany TV fans may best know Reinhold for his 1994 Emmy-nominated \"Seinfeld\" stint, in which he played a \"close talker\" (someone who stands uncomfortably close during a conversation) who develops an unnatural affection for Jerry's parents.\n\nAshton, 76, was another working actor whose role in \"Beverly Hills Cop\" made him suddenly recognizable. But nevertheless, his bread and butter would remain character roles in a long string of movies and TV shows over the subsequent decades.\n\nWhile his most high-profile non-Taggart role was that of a rival bounty hunter in the cult classic movie \"Midnight Run,\" Ashton spent nearly 40 years, from 1974 to 2012, appearing in countless TV series, including \"Kojak,\" \"Wonder Woman,\" \"M*A*S*H,\" \"Dallas\" and \"Law & Order: SVU.\"\n\nPinchot, 65, made a name for himself shortly out of Yale, the year before \"Cop\" came out, when he appeared in the Tom Cruise classic \"Risky Business.\" His performance as the outrageous and wildly accented art dealer in \"Cop\" then led to memorable appearances in movies such as \"After Hours,\" \"True Romance\" and \"The First Wives Club.\" And of course, there was Pinchot's eight-year run in the TV sitcom, \"Perfect Strangers.\"\n\nWhile he has largely been away from Tinseltown's spotlight in the past decades, Pinchot has made a name for himself as an audiobook narrator, with some 400-plus titles to his credit so far, ranging from Flannery O'Connor novels to the \"Memoirs of General William T. Sherman.\"\n\nReiser, 68, is another actor who before \"Cop\" appeared in a now-classic film, 1982's \"Diner.\" His success in Murphy's cop comedy eventually led to NBC greenlighting a sitcom Reiser co-created, \"Mad About You\" (1992 to 1999), in which he co-starred with Helen Hunt as his onscreen wife. While that series won a host of awards, 2011's \"The Paul Reiser Show\" lasted but a few episodes.\n\nReiser is less known for his considerable musical skills. He co-composed the theme song for \"Mad About You,\" and has collaborated with singers such as Melissa Manchester. His early forays as a musical act eventually bombed enough for him to turn to stand-up comedy."

      "text": "A black cop's frank look at tensions between police, communities of color\n\nIn his new book \"The Black and the Blue: A Cop Reveals the Crimes, Racism and Injustice in America's Law Enforcement\" (Hachette, 238 pp., ★★★ out of four), police veteran Matthew Horace attempts to speak truth to sometimes lethal power.\n\nHorace, who's African-American, presents a clear-eyed, often wrenching take on the tensions that exist between police and communities of color from the vantage point of a 28-year career spent patrolling the streets and supervising officers from Camden, New Jersey, to Colorado Springs.\n\nThere is frank discussion about bigoted cops, outdated procedures and fledgling signs of reform. In between, Horace offers testimonials from black law enforcement officers, many of whom entered the profession reluctantly but went on to have lauded careers. They speak of the tightrope they walk, between black citizens whose experiences with the law have left them weary and colleagues who are resistant to change.\n\nStill, the most powerful voice in \"The Black and the Blue\" is Horace's own, steady, forthright and rooted in his experiences on both sides of the blue line. (The book was written with former Los Angeles Times reporter Ron Harris.)\n\nHorace understands how decisions officers make can go awry in a split second. He has also been racially profiled, and once, eight years into his career, found himself splayed on the ground as a white officer pointed a gun at his head.\n\nHe notes the camaraderie he has felt among his law enforcement peers yet doesn't downplay that the conscious and implicit bias plaguing broader society infects station houses and bureaus, as well.\n\nHorace offers some glimpses of hope. In New Orleans, for instance, home to what was one of the most corrupt departments in the country, police superintendent Michael Harrison has implemented new initiatives and fired not only officers who use unjustified force but those who witness it and say nothing.\n\n\"The Black and the Blue\" is an affirmation of the critical need for criminal justice reform, all the more urgent because it comes from an insider who respects his profession yet is willing to reveal its flaws.\n\nScrolling through its pages can be disheartening.  It is overwhelming to contemplate how to root out bias, and stop the killings of unarmed black citizens, when even officers caught committing such acts on videotape are usually acquitted, if they are charged at all.\n\nYet Amy Hunter says we must try.\n\nIn \"The Black and the Blue,\" Horace asks Hunter, a hospital manager who lives with her family in an affluent section of St. Louis, why she went to Ferguson, Missouri , and endured tear gas to protest the killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown, whose shooting by police officer Darren Wilson in 2014 proved a flash point in the movement to protect black lives.\n\nHunter recounted that one day, her 12-year-old son was stopped and searched by police as he walked home. The officers claimed he fit the description of a grown man wielding a machete.\n\nHer son asked if he'd been treated that way because he was black, then, with tears in his eyes, asked how long such treatment would last.\n\n\"For the rest of your life,'' she told him. \"That's why I went to Ferguson. I want this to stop.''"

      "text": "A black officer tells his story in 'Once Upon a Cop'\n\nAs the spotlight on law enforcement grows ever harsher, from the sex scandal roiling the Oakland Police Department to the corruption web enveloping the NYPD to the numbing tick-tock of black men killed by the police, the perspective of a top cop - a black cop - makes one sit up and take notice.\n\nIn his memoir Once A Cop (Atria, 308 pp., *** out of four stars), Corey Pegues, who rose to deputy inspector in the New York Police Department before leaving the force in 2013, gives us an incisive look at life on both sides of the blue line.\n\nPegues has straddled multiple worlds since he was a child growing up in Queens. He was a teenage crack dealer who was also a popular high school basketball player. As a police officer, he felt a connection to the residents of the underprivileged communities he often patrolled, unlike many of his peers. He was a black man who endured racism and resentment from some white officers, but enjoyed the friendship and respect of more than a few as well.\n\n3rd Oakland police chief in eight days quits amid sex, race scandals\n\nThat duality gives Pegues a nuanced perspective of the often-fractious relationship between communities of color and law enforcement. He feels, for instance, that New York's controversial stop-question-and-frisk policy could be useful, but was abused as a result of political pressure. He believes most officers want to do a good job and get home safely rather than engage in confrontation.\n\nYet Pegues also recounts his own feelings of powerlessness when he was a rookie manning a police rally, and watched some of his fellow officers topple barricades and aim racial epithets at David Dinkins, New York's first black mayor. \"Police can't police police,'' he writes of the memory.\n\nApart from the most publicized instances of police brutality,  \"the real problem, the real frustration, is the day to day,'' he says. \"There's an arrogance about the way a lot of cops treat minorities.'' And Pegues reveals his own complicated relationship with the NYPD. Saying he was harassed because of his activism, Pegues filed suit against the department, The New York Post and Nassau County for race discrimination, defamation and other allegations.\n\nOnce A Cop is not all police work. There are riveting glimpses of a different sort, as Pegues reminisces about the golden age of hip-hop in Queens, home to Run DMC, LL Cool J and other rap luminaries in all their Kangol-wearing glory. Those vignettes are fleeting. There could have been more.\n\nBut perhaps Pegues felt at this moment in America it was more important to relay his experiences wearing a badge. To that end, his example is a somewhat hopeful one.\n\nWhen Pegues became a lieutenant, he forbade his officers from sending those arrested for offenses such as turnstile jumping to central booking simply because they did not have an I.D. - an act that was not a crime, but because of the booking process led to arrest records for people who were often young, black or brown.\n\nHe wanted to protect as well as serve. \"The power not to arrest someone,'' he writes. \"That power lies 100% with the police officer - and that's a lot of power for one person to have.''"

      "text": "Eddie Murphy talks new 'Beverly Hills Cop' movie, Axel Foley's 'Everyman' charm\n\nIf you're amazed that we're talking about \"Beverly Hills Cop\" some 40 years after that movie essentially birthed the buddy-cop comedy genre (here's looking at you, \"Lethal Weapon\" and \"Bad Boys\" ), Eddie Mur p hy shares your sense of wonder.\n\n\"The pope was 47 when the first movie came out, I'm talking about the sitting one (Pope Francis),\" Murphy reflects in a conversation with USA TODAY. \"So he might have seen it. The pope has probably seen 'Beverly Hills Cop.' Wow.\"\n\nMurphy's somewhat tongue-in-smirking-cheek speculation might extend to the movie's two sequels, in 1987 and 1994. And perhaps - if the pontiff indeed is an Axel Foley fan - the fourth film of the enduring franchise, \"Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F\" ( streaming Wednesday on Netflix ).\n\n\"Axel and all the characters, they're very much part of the lexicon,\" says Murphy, 63. \"I mean, somewhere in the world, one of those movies is on TV right now.\"\n\nFor this installment, \"it really was mainly about getting a good script and getting to the set, and that was it. As soon as they said 'Action,' I was Axel again.\"\n\nJudge Reinhold , who returns once again as Foley sidekick Billy Rosewood, joining fellow returnee John Ashton as cop John Taggart, says when the trio hopped in a squad car again, fireworks ignited.\n\n\"I hadn't seen Eddie in maybe 10 years, but when the three of us were together, it was magic, it was like we'd never stopped,\" Reinhold says. \"The night of that shoot was special. The three of us showed up dressed the same as we used to, and the crew, it was spooky for them, it was like we'd walked out of their past. Things got quiet.\"\n\nIt wasn't a given that Foley & Co. would resume their comedic crime-busting routine. After \"Beverly Hills Cop III\" failed to score big at the box office, the conclusion seemed to be that the Detroit-to-LA shenanigans were a wrap.\n\nBut in 2019, Netflix bought the rights to a fourth movie with an option for an additional sequel. And the race was on.\n\n\"Axel F\" includes veterans as well as new faces: Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Bobby, Kevin Bacon as Captain Grant and Taylour Paige as Foley's adult daughter, Jane. Also onboard after skipping out in 1994 was Jerry Bruckheimer, who produced the first two '80s hits, along with first-time movie director, Mark Molloy, a veteran of TV commercials for Apple products .\n\n\"I just wanted to create the right environment for Eddie to thrive, which included a great script and a cast that allows him to improvise as needed,\" says Molloy, citing a manic scene in a helicopter with Gordon-Levitt. \"Everything was on the page, but there were some great moments and accents that Eddie improvises that takes scenes from an eight to a 10.\"\n\nBruckheimer was eager to recapture the series' winning form. \"For me, coming back was an easy decision,\" he says. \"It's always a dream to work with Eddie Murphy, you just wanted to talk about the old days while making the new one. But you also can see how he's evolved as an actor and comedian, just like old wine.\"\n\nBruckheimer, 80, pauses, then laughs.\"He looks so young, I wish I had the same genes,\" he says. \"Whatever he's doing, it's working, maybe he'll give us a few pointers.\"\n\nMurphy's fountain of youth is on the minds of many of his co-workers.\n\n\"Eddie has always taken care of himself, even in the '80s,\" says Reinhold. \"He has a lot of discipline. He takes care of his gift. He's a student of the (comedy) form, going back to (Charlie) Chaplin and (Buster) Keaton.\"\n\nPaige, who plays Murphy's screen daughter, ascribes the comedian's youthful look and serenity to his family (Murphy is a father of 10).\n\n\"His family and his home life keeps it all balanced for him,\" says Paige. \"If I learned anything from Eddie during the shoot, it was to preserve my energy on set. He was always asking, 'Are we going to go?' And if we were, he was on it.\"\n\nThe actress got a kick out of ribbing her famous co-star about his cloistered life.\n\n\"We were driving around (shooting a car scene) and he would just start reading off the names of fast-food places we were passing, and at one point he said, 'I bet you prefer Chipotle, you seem like an organic type,' \" she says. \"I said, 'I bet you've never even been inside a Chipotle!' And, yes, I am here to verify the man has never had Chipotle.\"\n\nSo, let's see, no alcohol, no fast food ... what else? Murphy waves off talk about his preternaturally youthful appearance.\n\n\"Well, I don't know the answer, maybe just genetics,\" he says. \"I don't have a regime, I wish I could say (he affects a deep voice), 'I eat this and I drink that.' But I'll tell you what, I don't drink. I can tell you how many drinks I've had in my life on two hands and have fingers left over. Pretty much zero alcohol and zero tobacco and the least amount of stress.\"\n\nHe leans back in his chair and smiles. \"Otherwise, I do the same (stuff) everyone else does.\" And then there it is, that very Foley laugh, a deep heh-heh-heh .\n\nThat Murphy has managed to keep the vices of success at bay is fairly unique in Hollywood history. After all, Murphy has been famous since he was a 19-year-old talent who saved a then-sinking \"Saturday Night Live.\"\n\nHis rocket just soared. Stand-up comedy tours turned into hit albums and specials, and while not everything connected with movie audiences, there have been enough gems (from \"Shrek\" to \"My Name Is Dolemite\") to cement his name in the comedy firmament.\n\nBut even Murphy didn't seem to recognize how iconic his wise-cracking Detroit cop had become. He was initially reluctant to put the character's now-classic Detroit Lions jacket on again.\n\n\"I was like, so he has the same jacket on from 30 years ago? I didn't want to do it,\" he says. \"But then they said, 'Axel's clothes are iconic, like Indiana Jones.' \"\n\nMurphy flashes that grin.\n\n\"So I said, 'OK, so my jacket is like Indiana Jones' hat and his whip? Fine, I'll put it on,' \" he says. \"But actually, it works. Because Axel's appeal is that he's not flashily dressed, he doesn't care about his clothes or anything, he's just doing police work. He's the Everyman, I think that's why the character has been around for so long. You can relate to him.\"\n\nAs for what's next, Murphy talks about perhaps a one-man show of sorts on Broadway, but he's also game for another Foley caper, should Netflix hit the green light. Of all the memorable characters he's created over the decades, something about this crime-busting crew has bored into his soul.\n\n\"It's a trip, most movies, you don't see them much after they're first on,\" he says. \"But (with 'Cop'), now you're locked in with these actors forever.\"\n\nAnd Murphy seems more than OK with that."

I cannot keep checking. I will get into trouble.\"\n\nShe faced up to two years in jail under sentencing guidelines but was handed six months in prison, suspended for 12 months, after a judge ruled she was \"profoundly immature\" and \"not corrupt\".\n\nGayle McCoubrey, prosecuting, said an unnamed member of the public contacted police in March 2023, after overhearing Bury's mother, Andrea Mercer, sharing information about a rape that had occurred in Lancashire.\n\n\"She was heard to say, 'I asked Molly. She checked her police thing and she said it was a rape',\" the court heard.\n\nPolice systems then identified that Bury had viewed logs on a police-issued Samsung device while off duty.\n\nInvestigations revealed Bury, who was nicknamed \"hot cop\" by locals after a crime prevention workshop, had been accessing the police logs between October 2019 and March 2023 to share \"idle gossip\" for ''no policing purpose\".\n\nShe also obtained information on the death of a baby, a stabbing and a preplanned arrest of a robbery suspect.\n\nShe admitted she had been \"stupid and nosey\" but insisted she was not \"malicious\".\n\nMost of the information was accessed when she was on annual or sick leave.\n\nBury resigned from the force while under investigation, Lancashire police said.\n\nHad she not already resigned she would have been dismissed, a misconduct hearing last year found.\n\nBulley, 45, was found dead in the River Wyre at St Michael's on Wyre in February 2023 following a three-week search which provoked wild speculation on social media .\n\nA coroner later concluded she had drowned after accidentally falling into the water while walking her dog.\n\nBury, a mother of one from Accrington in Lancashire, appeared at Chester magistrates' court and admitted to 32 charges of unauthorised access to police logs.\n\nPolice raided Bury's home and recovered a mobile phone which showed she had sent confidential information about various police incidents.\n\nIn October 2019, she sent details about a stabbing incident which she had attended to a friend named Elliott, saying: \"The lad from [the] stabbing survived.\"\n\nShe later sent him further messages saying: \"A hit and run just came in. Woman probably going to die. Car drove onto the pavement into this lad and girl.\"\n\nIn a further message regarding a dead baby found in December 2019, Bury said: \"Oh my God, it is a one-year-old child.\"\n\nOn a day off she sent further texts, saying to Elliott: \"Undercover police are outside your address,\" to which he replied: \"F--- the feds.\"\n\nAt 10.59am on January 29 2023, Bury was on a sick day when her friend, a woman named Amy Sanderson, asked: \"Any update on Nicky?\" to which she replied: \"I will get in s--- if they see me checking,\" Ms McCoubrey told the court.\n\nMs McCoubrey added: \"At 11.01am, she accessed the Samsung device and searched again and a further message was sent regarding Nicola Bulley.\"\n\n\"At 6.33pm, Ms Sanderson sent a message saying 'Any update?' and Bury replied: 'I have not checked.

She was spreading gossip or sensitive information. There was no policing purposes for this defendant to access the logs on these occasions.\"\n\nBury was also ordered to complete 30 days of rehabilitation activity and pay £154 in costs and surcharge.\n\nDeputy Senior District Judge Tan Ikram said: \"These are not corrupt messages. There is no money involved. There is no suggestion this is a criminal fraternity.\n\n\"She clearly knew what she was doing was wrong, but the harm is damage to the reputation of police and confidence in policing. It was immature gossiping throughout. She was doing work without any insight into the job. It was tittle tattle nonsense much of it.\"\n\nDet Ch Insp Pete Reil, from the force's anti-corruption unit, said: \"Molly Bury's behaviour fell way below what the constabulary expects and what the public would expect of a serving police officer.\n\n\"I want to make it clear that the overwhelming majority of police officers in Lancashire are law abiding, respectful and go to work to make a difference in the communities in which they serve.\n\n\"Where there is any evidence of wrongdoing by an officer or staff member, our [anti-corruption unit] will identify it, investigate it and work with the Crown Prosecution Service to take the appropriate action.\"\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

      "text": "UN climate talks 'no longer fit for purpose' say key experts\n\nThe United Nations' COP climate talks are \"no longer fit for purpose\" and need an urgent overhaul, key experts including a former UN secretary general and former UN climate chief have said.\n\nIn a letter to the UN , senior figures say countries should not host the talks if they don't support the phase out of fossil energy.\n\nThis week the Azerbaijani president told world leaders gathered in his country for COP29 that natural gas was a \"gift from God\" and he shouldn't be blamed for bringing it to market.\n\nThat came days after the BBC reported that a senior Azerbaijani official appeared to have used his role at COP to arrange a meeting to discuss potential fossil fuel deals.\n\nThe UN's climate talks have made significant progress in recent years, despite the fact that unanimous agreement is needed among almost 200 countries to take action.\n\nThe Paris climate agreement , signed in 2015, outlines a long-term plan to rein in rising temperatures, as countries strive to keep that rise under 1.5C this century.\n\nThey have also agreed to transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems, and to treble renewable power by 2030.\n\nBut while the authors of this letter recognise these achievements, they feel that the slow-moving COP process is \"no longer fit for purpose\" in dealing with a fast-moving climate crisis.\n\n\"Its current structure simply cannot deliver the change at exponential speed and scale, which is essential to ensure a safe climate landing for humanity,\" said its signatories. They include former UN Secretary General Ban-Ki Moon, former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres and former president of Ireland Mary Robinson.\n\nThe authors are concerned that the current COP process is not able to make change happen quickly or able to force countries to act.\n\nAt last year's COP28 meeting in Dubai all countries agreed to \"transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems.\"\n\nBut 12 months later emissions of warming gases have increased once again, up by almost 1%.\n\nScientists say these emissions need to fall by 42% by the end of this decade to avoid a global temperature rise in excess of 1.5C, considered the threshold to far more dangerous impacts than we are seeing at present.\n\nOne of the authors of the letter, Christiana Figueres, later qualified her support for reforms, saying they had been \"misinterpreted in today's context.\"\n\nIn a statement she said: \"The COP process is an essential and irreplaceable vehicle for supporting the multilateral, multisectoral, systemic change we urgently need. Now more than ever.\n\n\"We are committed allies to and advocates for this process - and lend our total support to positive efforts underway to further strengthen it for the new era of implementation we are entering into.\"\n\nThe UN has yet to comment on the letter.\n\nAt the conference in Baku, negotiators from small island states were particularly concerned about any attempt to change the nature of the COP, where all countries are equal.\n\nThey worry that if decisions are made among the big emitters at forums such as the G20 group of richer nations, their small island voice will be excluded.\n\n\"We're not a part of those discussions,\" said Micahi Robertson who's an adviser to the Alliance of Small Island States at these talks.\n\nThe letter has been prompted by growing concerns about some of the countries chosen to host COP talks and their ability to deliver a significant advance in the fight against rising temperatures.\n\nJust before the latest conference started, a secret recording showed the chief executive of Azerbaijan's COP29 team, Elnur Soltanov, discussing \"investment opportunities\" in the state oil and gas company with a man posing as a potential investor.\n\nAt the start of COP29, the country's authoritarian leader, Ilham Aliyev, defended Azerbaijan's current exports of gas and plans to expand production by a third in the next decade.\n\n\"It's a gift of God,\" he told an audience in Baku.\n\n\"Every natural resource whether it's oil, gas, wind, sun, gold, silver, copper, all that are natural resources,\" he said.\n\n\"And countries should not be blamed for having them and should not be blamed for bringing these resources to the market because the market needs them, the people need them.\"\n\nThe use of oil and gas are major causes of global warming, as they release planet-warming gases like carbon dioxide when they are burned.\n\nPresident Aliyev also hit out at France for carrying out colonialist \"crimes\" and \"human rights violations\" in overseas territories.\n\nSuch strongly expressed views are extremely rare from the leader of a COP host, where the aim is to build consensus on how to tackle rising temperatures.\n\nThe authors of the letter are also concerned by the selection process for hosting COPs. Azerbaijan followed on from another major oil producer, the United Arab Emirates, which held the conference in Dubai last year.\n\nThe authors say that host countries \"must demonstrate their high level of ambition to uphold the goals of the Paris agreement.\"\n\nThey also want smaller, more frequent COPs with clear accountability for the promises that countries make.\n\nThe prolonged dry, sunny weather in March and April created ideal conditions for wildfires to spread.\n\nA van appears to have been driven slowly towards protesters as hundreds marched through London.\n\nThe creation of three \"dire wolf\" pups has raised hopes that it may be possible to resurrect extinct animals. But some scientists have grave concerns.\n\nClimate activists may be going deeper underground.\n\nThe UK Energy Secretary was speaking at the opening of a two day summit on energy security.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "What is COP29 and how will Trump's election affect the climate talks?\n\nWorld leaders taking part in the latest annual UN climate meeting in Azerbaijan are hoping to agree action to help rein in rising global temperatures.\n\nA key issue under discussion is how to get more cash to poorer countries, to help them curb their planet-warming gases, and to cope with the growing impacts of climate change.\n\nThe decision to hold the meeting in the Azerbaijani capital, Baku, has been criticised because of the country's ties to gas and oil.\n\nThe US election victory of Donald Trump - a known climate sceptic - could also prove to be a distraction, and some important leaders are not attending.\n\nCOP29 is the world's most important meeting on climate change.\n\nIt is led by the UN, and the 2024 event, the 29th such gathering, runs from 11-22 November.\n\nIt is being held in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, a central Asian country located between Russia and Iran.\n\nCOP stands for \"Conference of the Parties\".\n\n\"Parties\" refers to the countries that have ratified a treaty called the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change).\n\nThat document was signed back in 1992, by almost 200 countries.\n\nThe COP is the decision-making body linked to that agreement, and representatives of these countries meet every year to negotiate the best approaches to tackling the root causes of climate change.\n\nBetween 40,000 and 50,000 delegates are expected to attend COP29. This includes representatives from all UN member states, and the EU. Diplomats, climate scientists, trade union leaders and environmental activists will also take part.\n\nUK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told the conference that he wants the UK to have more \"ambitious\" climate goals .\n\nOther attendees include UN secretary general Antonio Guterres.\n\nHowever the leaders of some of the largest economies - and biggest carbon emitters - are notably absent from COP29.\n\nUS President Joe Biden, China's Xi Jinping and France's Emmanuel Macron are not attending. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Germany's Olaf Schulz and India's Narendra Modi will also not be there.\n\nThey are staying away for a range of reasons, but their absence could undermine the event's significance.\n\nLeaders who do attend will also have lots of other issues on their minds, including two expensive and difficult wars in the Middle East and in Ukraine, and global financial problems.\n\n\"No world leader is arriving with climate change at the number one spot in their inbox,\" says Oxford University's Prof Thomas Hale.\n\nThere's also an underlying feeling that Azerbaijan doesn't have the diplomatic or financial clout to secure a significant agreement.\n\nMany leaders think progress is more likely at COP30, which will be held in Brazil in November 2025.\n\nDuring COP29 key experts, including former UN Secretary General Ban-Ki Moon and former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres, said the COP process is \"no longer fit for purpose\" .\n\nThey said: \"Its current structure simply cannot deliver the change at exponential speed and scale, which is essential to ensure a safe climate landing for humanity.\"\n\nA key question this year is money.\n\nUnder the Paris agreement signed in 2015, world leaders pledged to try to prevent global temperatures rising by more than 1.5C. For that to happen countries need to ramp up their efforts to cut warming gases.\n\nAs part of the agreement, countries committed to develop a new cash target for developing nations by 2025. This money would be used to help emerging economies cut their carbon and adapt to the worst impacts of rising temperatures.\n\nGetting agreement on a new finance target is seen as a critical step in building trust between rich and poor nations as, so far, the track record hasn't been great.\n\nAfrican countries and small island states want to see climate finance in total reach over a $1tn a year by 2030.\n\nUp to now countries like China and the Gulf States have been classified as developing economies and been exempt from contributing.\n\nAccording to the EU and other wealthy countries, that must change if the overall amount of cash is to be increased.\n\nGovernments' plans for tackling climate change in their own countries could also be a tricky issue. They must update their action plans every five years, with the next deadline falling in February 2025.\n\nSome countries will release their strategies at this COP, but if they're weak and look unlikely to stop global warming rising beyond 1.5C, it could cause problems with countries on the front lines of climate change.\n\nIt is also not clear whether the fossil fuel agreements passed at the last climate talks are still in place. There were signs at the G20 talks earlier in 2024 that some countries wanted to roll back on promises to move away from burning oil, coal and gas.\n\nMajor UN talks on protecting nature also collapsed in Colombia in October, after nations failed to agree key goals.\n\nAzerbaijan has big plans to expand gas production, by up to a third, over the next decade. Some observers worry that a country with that goal is in charge of a conference that aims to transition away from fossil fuels.\n\nThese fuels are one of the main causes of climate change because they release planet-warming greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide when burned for energy.\n\nThere are also concerns, reported by the BBC, that Azerbaijani officials are using the climate conference to boost investment in the country's national oil and gas company.\n\nAzerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev told the conference that oil and gas are \"a gift of god\" , and that countries should not be blamed for having them, or selling them on the international market.\n\nShortly afterwards, Mr Guterres told the conference that doubling down on the use of fossil fuels was \"absurd\".\n\nThere are also deep reservations about holding the meeting in a country with a poor human rights record, where political opposition isn't tolerated.\n\nThe US president-elect is a known climate sceptic who has called efforts to boost green energy a \"scam\", and his victory has been seen by climate experts as a major setback .\n\nHe won't actually be at COP29, and the team representing President Biden will push for progress, but they know that anything agreed will not bind the new administration.\n\nWith Trump's election the US is expected to withdraw from the Paris agreement, and from providing finance.\n\nHowever it's also possible that Trump's re-election might drive a new sense of unity among other leaders, even building a coalition who might agree a major step on money for poorer  countries.\n\nExperts argue that the climate crisis - and the world's collective response to it - will outlast a second Trump term.\n\nThe warning alarms from the climate could not be stronger.\n\nIt is now \"virtually certain\" that 2024 - a year punctuated by intense heatwaves and deadly storms - will be the world's warmest on record , according to projections by the European climate service.\n\nThe impacts of warmer oceans have been seen with very powerful hurricanes Helene and Milton slamming into the US in the summer.\n\nThe devastating flooding that killed at least 200 people in Spain in October was also fuelled by higher sea temperatures in the Mediterranean.\n\n\"Climate change is a cumulative problem. That means that with every year of delay, there is additional warming that we commit our planet to. Now is the time that we need to take action,\" explains Prof Joeri Rogelj at Imperial College London.\n\nIn the short-term, agreements at COP can change how nations build their economies, for example by pushing the development of green power. That can affect where we get our energy from and how much we pay for it in our bills.\n\nIt can also commit countries to paying large sums of money into funds for poorer countries. In the UK this currently comes from aid budgets paid for by taxpayers, although private financial institutions are expected to contribute significantly.\n\nIn the long-term, the talks aim to build a safer, cleaner world for everyone and prevent the worst of climate change.\n\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.\n\nOutside the UK?

      "text": "The black cop who has a problem with 'Black Lives Matter'\n\n\"Black Lives do not matter to most black people...Only the lives that are taken at the hands of cops or white people, matter.\"\n\nThat is the conclusion of a strongly-worded post , external that has been shared more than 130,000 times on Facebook and has racked up hundreds of thousands of views on other media platforms such as Imgur , external .\n\nWhile the sentiment is provocative, it is the identity of the author that triggered particular interest. Jay Stalien's profile indicates he is an active police officer in Florida and previously Baltimore. And he is black.\n\nThe post was published last weekend, amid mounting racial tensions across America following the murder of five Dallas officers at a protest held over the police killings of two African-American men in Minnesota and Louisiana. Stalien, who says he is a Brooklyn native, was particularly scathing about Black Lives Matter , questioning whether the lives of police officers (including ones who are African-American) were as important to the movement, as black civilians killed by white police officers.\n\n\"I couldn't help but wonder if it had been me, a black man, a black cop, on TV, assassinated, laying on the ground dead...would my friends and family still think black lives mattered? Would my life have mattered?\" Stalien wrote.\n\nWhile the official Black Lives Matter Twitter account published a post , external shortly after the Dallas killings, saying that it did not condone violence towards anybody, Stalien's post certainly resonated with a large portion of social media users - many of them supporters of the Blue Lives Matter movement.\n\nIn his lengthy digital essay Stalien challenged assertions that black people are unfairly penalised by law enforcement. It was his arguments about black-on-black violence that seemed to get the most attention. Drawing on his own experience, Stalien said he chose a career in law enforcement because:\n\n\"I watched and lived through the crime that took place in the hood. My own black people killing others over nothing. Crack heads and heroin addicts lined the lobby of my building as I shuffled around them to make my way to our 1 bedroom apartment with 6 of us living inside. I wanted to help my community and stop watching the blood of African Americans spilled on the street at the hands of a fellow black man.\"\n\nBut Stalien expressed his frustration that his efforts to investigate black-on-black violence and bring the culprits to justice had met with outright hostility from the very community he sought to protect.\n\n\"They called me 'Uncle Tom', and 'wanna be white boy', and I couldn't understand why,\" he wrote.\n\n\"My own fellow black men and women attacking me, wishing for my death, wishing for the death of my family. I was so confused, so torn, I couldn't understand why my own black people would turn against me, when every time they called â¦I was there. Every time someone diedâ¦.I was there. Every time they were going through one of the worst moments in their livesâ¦I was there. So why was I the enemy?\"\n\nStalien, said that in an attempt to answer that question he looked into some of the most common complaints levelled at police by activists, to see if there was a statistical basis for these grievances.  Much of his article is taken up by a point-by point presentation of the results of that research, which Stalien uses to assert that many of the gripes of the Black Lives Matter movement are unfounded.\n\nAs this is an area where the use of statistics is particularly contentious, Trending sought a second opinion on some of the Stalien's statistical claims. We spoke with Philip Stinson , external , associate professor of criminal justice at Bowling Green State University in Ohio. So here are a couple of the common complaints which Stalien sets up in his article and then knocks down, followed by Stinson's take on that rebuttal.\n\nOfficer Stalien's view:\n\n\"A city where the majority of citizens are black (Baltimore for example) â¦will ALWAYS have a higher rate of black people getting arrested, it will ALWAYS have a higher rate of blacks getting stopped, and will ALWAYS have a higher rate of blacks getting killed, and the reason why is because a city with those characteristics will ALWAYS have a higher rate of blacks committing crime. The statistics will follow the same trend for Asians if you go to China, for Hispanics if you go to Puerto Rico, for whites if you go to Russia, and the list goes on. It's called Demographics\"\n\nDr Stinson's response:\n\n\"I don't agree with his logic.  There certainly is implicit bias in many police street encounters with black males.  Many police officers in the United States view blacks in these encounters as a threat.  Similarly, many of the blacks in these street encounters with police officers are afraid of the police.  There are good points to be made on all sides of this issue.\"\n\nOfficer Stalien's view:\n\n\"Fact: As of July 2016, the breakdown of the number of US Citizens killed by Police this year is, 238 White people killed, 123 Black people killed, 79 Hispanics, 69 other/or unknown race.\"\n\nDr Stinson's response:\n\n\"Blacks are shot and killed by on-duty police officers at a HIGHER RATE than are white persons.  In other words, it is misleading to look at the raw numbers without adjusting for population differences.\"\n\nThis view was echoed by analysis published by Quartz , external magazine which concluded that while raw data from 2015 showed that \"police have indeed killed nearly twice as many white as black Americans\", when you \"look at those killings as a share of each ethnic group's population, it's a very different story: black people are at three times as high a risk of dying at the hands of police as white people.\"\n\nOfficer Stalien's view:\n\n\"Fact: Black people kill more other blacks than Police do, and there are only protest and outrage when a cop kills a black man. University of Toledo criminologist Dr. Richard R. Johnson examined the latest crime data from the FBI's Supplementary Homicide Reports and Centers for Disease Control and found that an average of 4,472 black men were killed by other black men annually between Jan. 1, 2009, and Dec. 31, 2012. Professor Johnson's research further concluded that 112 black men died from both justified and unjustified police-involved killings annually during this same period.\n\nDr Stinson's response:\n\n\"These numbers are wrong to the extent that the data relied upon are incomplete and inaccurate.  Both the Supplemental Homicide Reports and the CDC data sets underreported.  We know that, in part, from the Washington Post numbers for 2015 and 2016.  But, we do not know if the error and bias in the underreported data in the FBI and/or CDC is systematic or random.  As such, I would not use either data set to draw statistically significant conclusions,\" adds Stinson.\n\nWhatever your take on the data, many found Stalien's post to be a powerful testimony about the complexities of life as a black police officer in the US.\n\nOn Tuesday, President Obama addressed both the nation's police and its protestors , external about working together and acknowledging that bridges needed to be built.\n\nAt a memorial service for the slain five police officers at Meyerson Symphony Center in Dallas, he said \"When anyone paints all police as biased or bigoted, we undermine those officers we depend on for our safety.\"\n\nThen he added, \"America, we know the bias remains. We simply cannot turn away and dismiss those in peaceful protest as troublemakers and paranoid. To have your experience denied like that, dismissed by those in authority, it hurts.\"\n\nBlog by Megha Mohan , external\n\nNext story: CoiffeurGate: The high cost of French President Francois Hollande's haircut\n\nYou can follow BBC Trending on Twitter @BBCtrending , external , and find us on Facebook , external .

      "text": "Baltimore ex-cop Michael Wood Jr on brutality and racism\n\nEx-officer Wood says he saw police beat handcuffed suspects (file photo)\n\nFormer Baltimore Police officer Michael A Wood Jr caused a storm on social media after tweeting shocking examples of police misconduct that he says he witnessed while on the force.\n\nThese allegations come under the shadow of allegations that police brutality caused the death of Freddie Gray, leading to riots across the city in April.\n\nWe asked Sgt Wood, who left the department in 2014, to elaborate a bit more on the allegations in his tweets. The allegations, which have not been independently verified, include officers attacking a woman, defecating in beds and racially targeting suspects.\n\nBaltimore Police say the allegations are \"serious and very troubling\" and called on Mr Wood to provide full details so they can launch an investigation. Their full response is included at the end of this piece.\n\nWARNING: This piece contains explicit language.\n\nI was a rookie in around 2005. The detective was coming out of the door at the same time. He bumped into her and when she turned, she was like \"excuse me\". He immediately reached back, smashed her in the face. I'm paraphrasing, but he said \"bitch you don't talk to me that way\".\n\nI was a rookie, I didn't know anything. I just got scared and got into my car and left.\n\nWhat was her race?\n\nShe was black.\n\nWas that a factor?\n\nI don't know, this officer was such an asshole I'm not sure it would have mattered. To you this is shocking but I don't think a single person that lives in a low income area in any city in America would find that a shocking statement.\n\nBlack youth rioted in Baltimore following Freddie Gray's death\n\nI was a rookie again. I got a call on the radio that there was a foot chase, \"I got a black male running\".\n\nI corner him in an alley, he tried to get away, there is a little bit of a struggle but no big deal. I handcuff him and as he is laying on the ground, the officer that was chasing him comes round the corner.\n\nAnd with a steel-toed boot, just boom right in the face. His eye instantly swells up and he is hurt pretty good.\n\nThis was cowardly but I just went, \"What the hell dude?\"\n\nI said: \"He's your suspect and I'm out of here.\"\n\nDid you think to report it?\n\nNo! That would have been unheard of. Anyone who runs gets beat up. That's common in America. I wasn't putting myself in the victim's shoes, I was thinking this isn't me. This guy is an asshole but this isn't me - I'm out of here.\n\nIn around 2008, I ended up being assigned to a plain clothes anti-narcotics unit. We would do big raids around the city, and you would frequently do big raids with people you didn't know.\n\nSo we were in a raid [in a suspect's home], and somebody was pissing on a pillow and somebody else was shitting in the corner - and it was just like, what the hell are these guys doing?\n\nIn the car the detectives with me were like who the hell does this? Apparently some people did it in the past and it was a throwback to then.\n\nThis seems very brazen - you would be leaving a lot of forensic evidence?\n\nRight! I said the same thing. Someone is going to be like someone pissed on my sheet. They are going to be like, [the evidence] it's right there!

It's a plausible excuse.\n\n\"The Wire isn't Baltimore but it's got some dramatically accurate representations\"\n\nThe Wire isn't Baltimore but it's got some dramatically accurate representations. There are a load of officers, and there are a bunch of black guys on the corner and they jump out of there car and search them. And as long as they're cool they say \"alright man, get off the corner\".\n\nLegally you can't go into their pockets, you can't search them but that happens to everybody. You just grab them and start searching them. I did it, we all do it - it's what police do. Those are all illegal searches.\n\nHow frequently did you do it?\n\nI was standing there doing it with everybody else. That's just what you're taught to do. You don't even think -  it's what you do.\n\nThis was a realisation that I didn't even come to until very recently. So I ended up getting my bachelor's degree when I was in the police department. I started reading things like Freakonomics - things that teach you to think from a critical perspective.\n\nI was a shift commander, and I told the shift that when you go out there doing car stops:\n\n\"I don't want to see you stopping an old lady - this is Baltimore! You stop 16-24 year old black males.\"\n\nWhy? Because 16-24 black males are the ones who commit all the crime. It's not until later that you complete the logic circle and realise that black and white [people] have drug possession at the same rate. You are only locking up black guys because they have drugs on them, and then they get in more trouble. We didn't know about the concept of institutional racism.\n\nYou left in 2014 - is that common?\n\nOh it will continue to be common until somebody takes over an agency and says no [to racial profiling].\n\nIf the officers are found guilty of Freddie Gray's murder how will the police respond?\n\nI don't think there is [any] chance that they will be happy that a murderer was caught. That seems unfathomable right now. They're gonna feel like their people got railroaded. They're still in us versus them, they don't see Freddie Gray as a human being victim. They see Freddie Gray as a them, as somebody else, a bad guy.\n\nThe recent allegations made by Mr Michael Wood are serious and very troubling.  The Police Commissioner has made clear that the Baltimore Police Department will never tolerate malicious conduct.\n\nWe hope that during his time as both a sworn member and as a sergeant with supervisory obligations, Mr Wood reported these disturbing allegations at the time of their occurrence.  If he did not, we strongly encourage him to do so now, so that our Internal Affairs Division can begin an immediate investigation.\n\nIn a recently published letter to the Baltimore Sun, the Police Commissioner made clear that his reform efforts remain focused on rooting out the type of conduct that is alleged.\n\nTrump questions Putin's desire for peace after meeting Zelensky at the Vatican\n\nThousands line streets of Rome as Pope Francis laid to rest after Vatican funeral\n\nWatch: How the Vatican said goodbye to Pope Francis\n\nAustralia's universal healthcare is crumbling.

The officer was fired from the NYPD shortly after the jury verdict in February.\n\nThe prosecutors for the case recommended probation and home confinement as punishment, a decision that has angered some members of Gurley's family.\n\n\"Because his incarceration is not necessary to protect the public, and due to the unique circumstances of this case, a prison sentence is not warranted ,\" said Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth Thompson, the Associated Press reported.\n\nMr. Gurley's shooting came at a time when national attention is focused on the shootings of unarmed black men by police officers, further fueling the tensions. Mr. Liang's case, however, was different from the protests that helped intensify the Black Lives Matter movement, as he was not being accused of intentionally shooting Gurley. Some Chinese Americans staged protests of their own , saying that Liang was being used as a scapegoat for police misconduct.\n\nDuring the hearing, Mr. Liang delivered an emotional testimony, saying that what happened was a deadly accident. Mr. Liang and his partner, Officer Shaun Landau were patrolling a darkened stairwell of a housing project on Nov. 20, 2014, when a startling sound prompted Liang to pull the trigger on his service pistol, inadvertently shooting Gurley. But the prosecutors have said that Liang acted recklessly, and did not make any effort to help Gurley after the shooting. Mr. Liang has said that he felt that both he and his partner weren't qualified to help Gurley.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

The lawyers argued that one of the jurors in the case had failed to disclose that his father had been convicted of manslaughter. The judge denied the claim saying that the defense had failed to prove that the juror's omission violated Liang's rights.\n\nThis report contains material from the Associated Press.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

At the trial, she also received a gesture of forgiveness.\n\nLoading...\n\nOct. 03, 2019, 12:22 p.m. ET | Dallas\n\nA white Dallas police officer who said she mistook a neighbor's apartment for her own and fatally shot him in his living room was sentenced to a decade in prison in a stunning courtroom scene that included the dead man's brother and the black judge embracing the sobbing officer.\n\nPeople outside of the courtroom reacted angrily to the sentence given to Amber Guyger in the death of Botham Jean, believing it was too lenient. But Mr. Jean's brother addressed her directly from the witness stand.\n\nBrandt Jean told Ms. Guyger that his brother would have wanted her to turn her life over to Christ, and that if she asks God for forgiveness, she will get it.\n\n\"I love you as a person. I don't wish anything bad on you,\" he said to Ms. Guyger, before asking the judge, \"I don't know if this is possible, but can I give her a hug?\"\n\nThe judge said he could, and Mr. Brandt and Ms. Guyger stood up, met in front of the bench and embraced while Ms. Guyger cried. Judge Tammy Kemp also hugged Ms. Guyger before she was led from the courtroom Wednesday.\n\nThe shooting in September 2018 drew widespread attention because of the strange circumstances and because it was one in a string of shootings of unarmed black men by white police officers.\n\nMs. Guyger, arrested three days after the shooting and later fired, was convicted of murder Tuesday. The jury, which was largely made up of women and people of color, could have sentenced her to up to life in prison or as little as two years. But prosecutors asked them to send her to prison for 28 years, which is how old Botham Jean would have been if he were still alive.\n\nShe will be eligible for parole in five years, after serving half of her sentence.\n\nAs video of the dramatic hearing circulated online, critics blasted the judge, saying her hug was inappropriate for the jurist overseeing the case. Meanwhile at a Dallas church where the Jean family gathered to worship and Botham Jean used to lead congregation singing, video of Brandt Jean embracing Ms. Guyger in court drew applause and \"amens\" when showed Wednesday night.\n\nDallas County District Attorney John Creuzot, a former trial judge, called Mr. Brandt's embrace of Ms. Guyger \"an amazing act of healing and forgiveness that is rare in today's society ... especially for many of our leaders.\"\n\nIf Mr. Jean's 18-year-old brother \"can heal and express healing in that fashion, in his words and in his deeds, I would hope that the greater community, not just Dallas but all of Texas and all of the United States, could gain a message from that,\" he told reporters.\n\nDallas Mayor Eric Johnson issued a statement saying he would \"never, ever forget the incredible examples of love, faith, and strength personified by Botham, Brandt, and the entire Jean family.\"\n\nDozens of demonstrators marched through parts of downtown Dallas on Wednesday night to protest the sentence. One woman was taken into custody after she appeared to disregard police orders not to obstruct traffic.\n\nMr. Guyger's attorney had asked jurors to show mercy, pointing to the good she did for people, including some who spoke at the sentencing hearing.\n\nAmong them was officer Cathy Odhiambo, who described Ms. Guyger as a longtime friend who dreamed of being a police officer when they waited tables at a TGI Fridays. She said the two of them went through the academy and then came through the police ranks together.\n\n\"Everybody that knows her knows that Amber is the sweetest person,\" Ms. Odhiambo said.\n\nMs. Odhiambo, who is black, was not asked about text messages that prosecutors said indicated a lack of sensitivity by Ms. Guyger toward black people. However, another fellow officer, Thomas MacPherson, said some of those texts sounded \"out of character\" for Ms. Guyger, whom he described as \"someone you could depend on.\"\n\nWhen a sniper opened fire on police during a rally in downtown Dallas three years ago, killing five of them, Ms. Guyger was \"so brave,\" Mr. MacPherson said. He said the two of them ran toward the gunfire and helped panicked citizens along the way.\n\nLaWanda Clark, who is black, said she was struggling with a crack cocaine addiction when she met Ms. Guyger during a drug house bust. She said Ms. Guyger, while ticketing her, told her it could be the catalyst for turning her life around. She said Ms. Guyger treated her as a person, not an addict, and that she's sober now.\n\nMr. Jean's father told jurors about how his son's death upended his life back in St. Lucia. Bertrum Jean said that after his son left their Caribbean island for college in Arkansas, he would call home every Sunday after church to catch up with the tightly knit family. Now, he said, his Sundays \"have been destroyed.\"\n\n\"How could we have lost Botham? Such a sweet boy. He tried his best to live a good honest life. He loved God. He loved everyone. How could this happen to him?\" the father said, breaking into tears.\n\nAfter the hearing, Mr. Jean's mother, Allison Jean, criticized the investigation into her son's death and the police training to shoot to kill.\n\nIf Ms. Guyger \"was trained not to shoot in the heart, my son would be alive today. He was no threat to her. He had no reason to be a threat to her, because he was in his own apartment,\" Allison Jean said.\n\nThe basic facts of the shooting were not in dispute. Ms. Guyger, returning from a long shift that night, parked on the wrong floor and mistook Mr. Jean's apartment for her own, which was directly below his. Finding the door ajar, she entered and shot him, thinking he was a burglar. He had been eating a bowl of ice cream before she fired.\n\nIn the frantic 911 call played repeatedly during the trial, Ms. Guyger said \"I thought it was my apartment\" nearly 20 times. Her lawyers argued that the identical physical appearance of the apartment complex from floor to floor frequently led to tenants going to the wrong apartments.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

They also asked why she did not call for backup.\n\nThis story was reported by The Associated Press.

But the killing of cops in Modesto, Calif., and Greenland, N.H., Thursday could point to other trends.\n\nLoading...\n\nApril 13, 2012, 7:40 p.m. ET | Los Angeles\n\nTwo high-profile shootings of police officers in small towns - one on each coast - are highlighting statistics that show a sharp spike in police officer deaths nationwide during the past two years.\n\nBut experts caution against the conclusion that criminals are ramping up a new \"war on cops,\" instead suggesting that the statistics merely show an end to a 40-year decline in officer fatalities.\n\nKilled Thursday in Greenland , N.H., was Chief Michael Maloney, one week short of retirement; four other officers were shot. Also on Thursday in Modesto , Calif. , a civilian and a sheriff's deputy were shot and killed by a homeowner who opened fire to avoid being evicted by authorities.\n\nLast year, 72 officers were killed in the line of duty, up from 41 in 2008. But the 2011 number is similar to 2001, when 70 officers were killed - and it is far below the statistics from the 1970s. In 1973, for example, 143 officer deaths were reported.\n\n\"Newton's law of criminology states that what goes down must eventually go up,\" says James Alan Fox , a criminologist at Northeastern University in Boston . \"After that long a decline, it's not surprising at all that the number has finally jumped.\"\n\nWhile other analysts agree, they add that Thursday's shootings highlight other areas of concern.\n\nFor instance, the number of assaults against police officers, has reached more than 50,000 per year, \"and we think that is underreported. The FBI thinks that's only half the number,\" says John Firman, director of research for the International Association of Chiefs of Police in Alexandria, Va .\n\nHis organization last year opened the Center for Prevention of Violence Against Police, funded by the US Department of Justice . \"We are taking an aggressive position against this kind of backlash against police in which a bad guy thinks he can just start shooting,\" he says. \"We are out to change the police practices and protocols to deal with it.\"\n\nPart of the problem is the so-called war on drugs, suggests Neill Franklin, executive director of Law Enforcement Against Prohibition , which favors legalizing and regulating drugs. The drug war has led to a huge deterioration in the relations between police and the community, with police departments becoming more likely to use SWAT teams, whether necessary or not, he says. That has heightened the tension of drug busts needlessly.\n\n\"Law enforcement changed its policies because they got all these government grants to obtain paramilitary equipment and then felt compelled to use it all the time, even just to serve a warrant,\" says Mr. Franklin. \"It has led to lots of unnecessary violence.\"\n\nIn some ways, the growing number of officer deaths is surprising, given that more police officers are wearing bulletproof Kevlar vests and medical treatments have improved, says Joel Jacobsen, assistant attorney general, criminal appeals division for New Mexico , in an e-mail.\n\n\"Both of those trends should be dramatically reducing the number of fatalities,\" he says. \"So the fact that the number remains roughly the same actually suggests an increase in the use of potentially-lethal force against officers.\n\nOne solution might be new protocols for how to serve warrants, says former Maryland police officer Tod Burke, now professor of criminal justice at Radford University in Virginia , in an e-mail.\n\n\"While these incidents are on the rise, they are not new. Police officers have been attacked/shot at for years while serving arrest and search warrants, apprehending suspects in a home, etc.,\" he says. \"While tragic, sometimes an orange is simply an orange. This may be a matter of police policy and revisiting officer safety issues while serving warrants.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

When Bussell asked if something was wrong, Tierra Gray told the officer that she had been evicted from her home.\n\nThe officer called several shelters to try and find the family housing, but \"Most of the shelters were overcrowded or there was a time requirement to be there and we were past that,\" said Bussell .\n\nBussell preceeded to put the family up in a hotel for ten days, and take them to a nearby Walmart where he bought them immediate essentials - all out of his own pocket.\n\n\"He told me that he was going to help and that we were going to get everything we need taken care of, and I just cried,\" Ms. Gray told WLWT News . \"I was like, 'Thank God, you are the angel I have been praying for all night.'\"\n\n\"He's the best,\" Gray's 8-year-old son Ziare told WLWT . \"He's like a friend to me.\"\n\nEven more extraordinary, Bussell did not tell anyone at work of his good deed. \"This is a true act of kindness,\" said Butler County Sheriff Richard K. Jones . \"He did not tell anyone at work what he had done but the lady took a picture with him and posted it on Facebook. That's actually how we found out.\"\n\nAnd this isn't the only recent act of kindness by local cops.\n\nLast year, a group of St. Paul police officers in Minnesota, pooled together money to fund a hotel room for Kim Washington, a homeless woman, and her three children and two grandchildren. Ms. Washington drove her family from Florida back to her home state of Minnesota after she decided to flee from a domestic violence situation with her boyfriend. All 6 were living in Washington's SUV in a parking lot because local homeless shelters were full.\n\n\"I wasn't a big fan of the police, but them helping allowed us to view them in a different light and say, 'Yes, they really do want to protect and serve,'\" Washington told KMSP . \"It was really nice.\"\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Swarms of police were entering the forest, grabbing people from the shadows and cuffing them. Moments before, she says, a friend she traveled with had gone off \"to take a walk through the forest.\" Prosecutors say he was on a mission of domestic terror. He was arrested along with 22 other activists that day and is now being held without bond and facing state charges that include domestic terrorism.\n\nThe protesters are here to stop what they dub Cop City - a proposed police training facility in the South River Forest, also known as the Weelaunee Forest. They are a mix of environmentalists, anti-police activists, and a loose confederation of like-minded groups. But police say they have gone beyond trespassing and are destroying property and using violence to push an ideology and endanger public safety. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is mulling federal charges. \"Everyone who comes here [to protest] knows full well they could catch a 'DT,'\" or domestic terrorism charge, says Annie, who refused to give her real name or allow a picture, concerned she would be targeted for arrest.\n\nThat is raising the stakes even higher, she adds. \"Someone has died,\" she says, referring to the police killing of a protester in January. \"More could die.\"\n\nThe United States is gripped by sharp disagreement about when activism tips into lawlessness. This week, left-wing protesters in Atlanta were charged with terrorism, laying down a new marker in the debate.\n\nAmericans have for years debated where to draw the line between law and order and the right to confront authority. But the use of domestic terrorism charges in Atlanta marks a new threshold. To many Americans, it's a long overdue step to take a firmer stand against political unrest and violence. But to others, the move speaks to a dangerous push to silence dissent and criminalize protest. In that way, the clash over \"Cop City\" is adding new questions to the national conversation: Where should the lines of terrorism be drawn in the name of public safety, and what does justice look like?\n\nThe fact \"that all sorts of actions could be terrorism really speaks to the leaky nature of it as an idea,\" says Dana Williams, a sociologist at California State University, Chico and co-author of \"Anarchy & Society.\" \"Is the purpose to simply get people off the street who are a danger to public safety? Is it to punish people for very specific acts for which there is documentary evidence? Or is it to sort of suppress a movement that has some traction, where applying the word 'terrorist' helps to coat people's perception of it?\"\n\nThe latest domestic terrorism charges arose from events that happened on Sunday. Police released a video that showed a crowd of people emerging from the woods and spreading out into a fenced-off clearing. As the group advanced, a pair of police officers retreated behind a gate. They ducked as fireworks popped near them. Soon, construction equipment on the scene was burning.\n\nAtlanta Police Department spokesperson Sgt. John Chafee said in a statement that those arrested \"used the cover of a peaceful protest ... to conduct a coordinated attack on construction equipment and police officers.\" They join 19 others facing terrorism charges from previous incidents in the ongoing campaign. It's the largest domestic terrorism sweep since a group of animal-liberation activists were indicted on terror charges in the 2000s. The charges come amid a growth in political violence in the United States. All but eight U.S. states experienced at least one incident of domestic terrorism between 2010 and 2021, according to the Government Accountability Office , with the phenomenon growing by 357% since 2013. The FBI defines domestic terrorism as \"violent, criminal acts committed by individuals and/or groups to further ideological goals stemming from domestic influences, such as those of a political, religious, social, racial, or environmental nature.\" Two percent of these attacks in 2019 occurred at demonstrations, the Center for Strategic and International Studies reported . The total committed by left-wing extremists grew almost 20 percentage points between 2020 and 2021 as demonstrations in cities like Portland, Oregon; Seattle; and Atlanta grew violent. Georgia passed its domestic terror law after the 2015 killing of nine Black church parishioners in Charleston, South Carolina. New York used its law for the first time to boost charges against the racist-inspired shooter in Buffalo in 2022. \"More and more, state prosecutors are using domestic terrorism statutes for different crimes being committed, whether they're extremist-related or school shootings,\" says Javed Ali, a former Department of Homeland Security counterterrorism official.\n\nWhen police and prosecutors are given new tools, they generally use them, adds Patrick Keenan, a professor at the University of Illinois College of Law in Champaign.\n\nLaws intended to deal with international terrorism like 9/11 \"are used more often in ordinary domestic crimes ... [so] they become regularized, normalized,\" he says. \"There is a risk to attaching the wrong label to crime.\"\n\nIn Atlanta, one's view of the charges often comes down to one's views of the protesters. At the South River trailhead along Constitution Road, it looks as if a zombie apocalypse just went down. Large piles of concrete indicate a torn-up bike path. Amid the tangle of concrete and steel, there is a welcome tent with a young attendant. A drawing shows a burning police car, upside down, surrounded by the words \"Resistance is love.\"\n\nThere is a memorial to \"Tortuguita,\" the nickname of Manuel Esteban Paez Terán, the slain activist. Police shot and killed him during a Jan. 18 operation to clear the site. They say Mr. Terán shot at police and they returned fire. Protesters contest that version of events. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation has begun a probe. One young person with red hair festooned with ponytails listens wearily to a reporter's question and then demurs an answer: \"I just need to sit here and eat my chili, cool with you?\" The first defenders moved into the forest nearly two years ago. They set up camp in trees, and attempts by authorities to clear the camps have met with pushback.\n\n\"This forest is at the heart of it all,\" says Annie, the activist.\n\nIn December, a prosecutor said a defendant inside a makeshift treehouse called for backup as police approached, and other activists appeared. She used a knife to cut a support rope for an arborist trying to dismantle her treehouse. Police used pepper spray balls to try to shake protesters out of the trees. They were met with thrown rocks and bottles.\n\n\"If you use violence to basically get a policy changed, that is domestic terrorism,\" the prosecutor said . \"This isn't just a bunch of kids playing in the woods.\"\n\nBen, one of the activists, sees corporate interests holding voters by the scruff of the neck. The new police center is being funded by the privately funded Atlanta Police Foundation, which has raised suspicions about the motivations behind the new center. \"None of these terrorism charges are going to stick,\" says Ben, who didn't give his last name out of concerns about arrests and harassment. \"This is about dividing us and suppressing us. They're trying to scare us. It's not going to work.\"\n\nThe Center for Strategic and International Studies found that far-right extremists waged the most attacks (49%) in 2021, but attacks by anarchists and other far-left extremists grew from 23% in 2020 to 40% in 2021. Right-wing extremists are far more likely to use heavier weapons and take actions that end in fatalities; anarchists, by and large, don't believe that destruction of property equals violence.\n\nBut, notes Mr. Ali, the former homeland security official: \"You don't have to kill anyone in order to conduct terrorism.\"\n\nThe most recent incident in Atlanta \"wasn't just a peaceful protest. They turned toward violent action; it was planned and organized and choreographed to go a certain way,\" says Mr. Ali, now a professor at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. \"Yes, far-left extremism looks different than far-right stuff, but it doesn't mean that the threat is zero in this country. You can't be biased from a law enforcement or a domestic security perspective. If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, it's probably a duck.\"\n\nYet others see a double standard. \"When we talk about political violence, we also leave out ... police violence,\" says Mike German, a former FBI agent who infiltrated right-wing extremist groups in the 1990s and is now a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nIn 2021, Mr. German testified to Congress that research shows how police actions incited riots during racial justice protests. He said law enforcement widely sees right-wing activists as \"more mainstream\" than left-wing ones. In his testimony, he pointed to instances of police declining to focus on white supremacist demonstrators while aggressively pursuing anti-fascists.\n\nIronically, the idea for the new police training center came about after the death of George Floyd, driven by the call for reform and better policing. But protesters worry that the facility will instead hone abusive crowd-control tactics. City officials have said few trees will have to be removed, and any that are will be replaced with plantings elsewhere.\n\nYet even as police brace for more conflict, lawmakers have begun to rethink the project. A firing range has already been pushed back from a residential area. Last week, the city announced a new citizen task force to further explore the idea.\n\nIn the meantime, both groups have only dug in deeper.\n\nAt the South River trailhead, a young female activist says she understands why activists are drawn to these woods - and why they vow to hold their ground.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Pink Houses in East New York, Brooklyn. In controversial \"vertical patrol,\" which are commonly used by the NYPD, officers descend from the roof of a building, walking through stairwells back to the basement.\n\n\"These are an essential part of policing,\" NYPD Commissioner William Bratton said soon after the shooting, \"every bit as essential in policing housing developments as the sector car is to policing the streets of a precinct.\"\n\nCritics contend that the cramped, poorly-lit stairwells create danger for police and residents , reducing their line of sight and creating the conditions for split-second decisions.\n\nAccording to Brooklyn District Attorney Ken Thompson, Liang had his finger on the gun's trigger as he opened a door to the stairwell and accidentally fired towards the landing below , where Gurley and his partner, Melissa Butler, were walking down the stairs. The single bullet ricocheted off of a wall and struck Gurley, who was pronounced dead at the hospital.\n\nGurley was a father to a daughter, now aged three.\n\n\"It was just a terrible tragedy,\" said Robert Brown, a former police captain and one of Liang's lawyers. He is also represented by Rae Koshetz, a former NYPD deputy commissioner. The defense team says that the shooting was accidental, and Liang has pleaded not guilty. If convicted, he could be sentenced to 15 years in prison.\n\nBut to many, Gurley's death represented the country's frequent failure to hold police officers accountable for the use of force, particularly toward black men. The shooting happened just days before a grand jury failed to indict former officer Darren Wilson for the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., a turning point in the Black Lives Matter movement that has protested similar cases of fatal police force in Baltimore, New York, and other cities around the country.\n\nLiang is \"one individual within a larger criminal justice system that permits police officers to kill with impunity and to harass our fathers, sons, daughters, and mothers,\" organizer Kerbie Joseph said last May outside a pretrial hearing .\n\nMore police officers have been charged with fatal shootings in 2015 than any year in a decade, as The Christian Science Monitor has previously reported, but experts caution against assuming that number will continue to rise. As of October, 12 officers had been charged, and police across the country had fatally shot more than 800 people. None of those 12, however, had been convicted.\n\nThe jury trial will likely examine whether Liang hesitated to report the shooting to superiors . In December 2014, the New York Daily News reported that Liang and his partner, Mr. Landau, were out of contact for several minutes after the shooting, although superiors and medical personnel were trying to reach them.\n\nLandau is expected to testify for the prosecution under an immunity agreement, and Liang may testify in his own defense.\n\n\"People like to hear from the person who's charged,\" said Mr. Brown, one of his lawyers.\n\nThis report includes material from Reuters.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

But by one measure - deportations - the federal government is doing more than it has ever done.\n\nIn 2009, the United States deported a record 387,790 people - a 5 percent increase over 2008. Nearly two months before the end of the 2010 federal fiscal year, the deportation rate is down slightly from 2009, but the number of removals is still likely to be more than triple what it was in 2001.\n\nThe numbers come from a recently released study by Syracuse University in New York . Among the other significant findings: An increasing share of deportees are immigrants who have been convicted of a crime, reflecting President Obama 's desire to reorient the deportation process toward targeting criminals.\n\nCritics of Mr. Obama worry that the focus on criminals could mean a pass for most noncriminal illegal immigrants. They also note that deportation alone does not represent a comprehensive immigration policy . But the deportation trend does run counter to many perceptions in border states and beyond about federal anti-illegal immigration efforts.\n\n\"We have never, ever deported so many people from the country as we are doing now,\" says Douglas Massey , an immigration expert at Princeton University in New Jersey .\n\nThe only other time deportations came close to existing levels was in the early 1930s, during quasi-official deportation campaigns against Mexicans. Expulsions peaked at 136,000 in 1931 and \"were done primarily by local officials and don't show up in federal statistics on deportations,\" Professor Massey says.\n\nThe current deportation boom began in the mid-1990s and accelerated after the 9/11 attacks. Since coming into office, Obama has begun to recast this trend.\n\nIn 2008 and 2009, for instance, the majority of removals were people who had not been convicted of any crime, according to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) data. Through Aug. 2, 51 percent of the 294,230 people deported or forced out this fiscal year were convicted criminals.\n\nThe report by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse is based on ICE data. It comes as the Obama administration endures strong criticism from state lawmakers and conservative pundits who say the federal government has done little to clamp down on illegal immigration and to secure the border.\n\nIn April, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer signed a law that required local police, during the course of their normal duties, to determine the immigration status of potential illegal immigrants. Last month, a federal judge put this and other controversial parts of the law on hold , although some portions became effective July 29.\n\nThe Syracuse report is a rebuke to those backing Arizona-style laws, says Gregory Chen , director of advocacy for the American Immigration Lawyers Association : \"It's a perfect example of how those allegations are based really only in politics.\"\n\nBut others say the Syracuse report doesn't tell the full story. Removals may be on the rise, but they are not enough to rein in illegal immigration, says Ira Mehlman , a spokesman with the Federation for American Immigration Reform .\n\n\"The problem isn't just criminal aliens, it is a general lack of respect for our laws, and even noncriminal aliens do have a significant impact on state budgets, on unemployment, on all sorts of things.\"\n\nMr. Mehlman says the efforts to remove criminals is a tactic designed to promote an eventual amnesty for illegal immigrants who don't commit crimes.\n\nThe report, however, suggests that a focus on criminals does not necessarily lead to a criminals-only policy. The report singles out the Secure Communities program - which relies on fingerprints from arrests - as one way the federal government can cast a wider net. The program targets not just suspects in serious crimes such as homicide, kidnapping, and sexual assault but also those arrested for traffic violations and a variety of other minor offenses.\n\nThe database-driven program is \"a very large contributor to the increase in criminal aliens ICE has identified,\" says Vincent Picard, an agency spokesman.\n\nSecure Communities was launched in October 2008 and plans are to implement it in every jail by 2013.\n\nSome say the continued rise in deportations may be Obama's way of trying to win over critics and make his version of comprehensive immigration reform more palatable to opponents.\n\n\"The administration is trying to gain credibility - with enhanced enforcement, troops to the border, and by other measures - to make clear it is taking action on immigration,\" says Jack Chin , a University of Arizona law professor.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

City spokeswoman Laura Shepard said officials would not discuss the case because their policy is to not talk about pending litigation.\n\nServo, 43, was arrested in January 2011 after he crashed into a ditch while off-duty. The lawsuit said that Servo, a detective who was the department's lead firearms instructor, had taken the police vehicle to a firearms training session in the nearby city of Troutdale . He later joined fellow officers for dinner and drinks.\n\n\"This was a common practice among (Gresham) officers and had become an inherent part of the culture,\" according to the lawsuit filed late Thursday.\n\nServo was alone when his vehicle veered into a ditch and he was not hurt. Though Servo refused to take breath or field sobriety tests, the Clackamas County sheriff's deputy who arrested him later testified before the state Department of Public Safety Standards and Training that Servo was probably one of the top 10 most intoxicated people he had arrested in almost 15 years of drunken-driving investigations.\n\nTwo months after the accident, Servo pleaded guilty to drunken driving and entered a diversion program. He fulfilled the program's requirements and the DUI was dismissed.\n\nServo also voluntarily entered an in-patient program at a Serenity Lane drug-and-alcohol treatment center, where he was diagnosed as an alcoholic.\n\n\"There were times where I went home and I couldn't get crime scenes out of my head; I went to drinking for that and there are other officers that do the same thing,\" Servo said Friday, adding that he has now been sober for 818 days.\n\nThe lawsuit alleged the chief fired Servo to save money, ignoring the known disability of alcoholism.\n\n\"I know it sounds kind of like a conspiracy theorist's claim,\" Kollie said, \"but we do believe there was a funding issue in the Gresham police department at the time.\"\n\nIt could not immediately be determined how common it is for alcoholics to claim their rights have been violated under the Americans with Disabilities Act. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , in a fact sheet, provides an example of how an alcoholic can justly be fired, and it's similar to the Servo case.\n\nIn its example, a federal police officer is involved in an accident for which he is charged with drunken driving. About a month later, he gets a termination notice stating that his conduct makes it inappropriate for him to continue. The officer says the arrest made him realize he is an alcoholic and that he is obtaining treatment. According to the EEOC, the employer may proceed with the firing.\n\nThe example, of course, is not precise because Servo's crash happened while he was off-duty.\n\n\"The ADA has provisions in it, across the board, to not require employers to subject other people to unreasonable risk to accommodate a disability,\" said Bob Joondeph, executive director with Disability Rights Oregon .\n\nJoondeph said he couldn't comment on any specifics in the Servo case, but generally accommodations for an alcoholic might include letting the worker attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings - not allowing them to drink on the job or drive drunk.\n\nSeparate from the lawsuit, Servo is appealing the standards-and-training agency's decision to strip him of his police certification.\n\nServo is currently working as a private investigator.\n\n___\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Top 3 Things To Know And Why It Matters\n\nBy Dianne Plummer\n\nBy Dianne Plummer ,\n\nContributor.\n\nA woman cleans the floor in front of the logotype at the venue for the 2024 United Nations Climate ... More Change Conference (COP29) in Baku on November 11, 2024. (Photo by ALEXANDER NEMENOV/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nAs global temperatures continue to rise and extreme weather events increase in frequency, the annual United Nations Climate Change Conference, known as the Conference of the Parties, has never been more significant. COP is an essential gathering where representatives from almost every country meet to negotiate climate agreements, addresses global warming, and discuss strategies to combat climate change. But what exactly is COP, and why should it matter to everyone?\n\nCOP stands for the Conference of the Parties, which refers to the countries that have signed onto the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which is an international treaty established in 1992. The overall goal of this treaty is to reduce greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere and to slow the warming of our planet. COP started as a recurring platform for countries to come together and assess progress and renew or strengthen their climate commitments.\n\nThe first COP meeting was in 1995, and since then, it has become the world's largest forum for climate negotiations. It has essentially evolved into a global movement that includes not only governments but also corporations, environmental organizations, scientists, and activists. COP has been pivotal in establishing significant climate agreements, the most notable being the 2015 Paris Agreement, in which countries pledged to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, with an aspirational target of 1.5 degrees. As an annual event, it is essential because it provided countries with the ability to update their commitments based on the latest climate science. As a result of COP, the world has a structured framework for discussing urgent and evolving climate issues and enacting policies to address them.\n\nBAKU, AZERBAIJAN - NOVEMBER 11: Participants from Kenya photograph one another in front of a ...

(Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images)\n\nOne of the main reasons COP is essential is that it holds countries accountable for their climate commitments. COP is where nations present their Nationally Determined Contributions. NDCs are individual targets that each country sets to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. These contributions are updated every five years, focuses on driving countries toward more ambitious climate goals over time.\n\nMoreover, COP provides a platform for discussing the financial mechanisms needed to support climate action. Developing countries, which are often most affected by climate change but have contributed the least to its causes, rely on financial support from wealthier nations to build resilience and adopt cleaner energy sources. For example, Small Island Developing States contribute 1% of global emissions, however they are the ones experiencing the detrimental effects such as sea level rise and harsher and more frequent storms.\n\nAt COP21 in 2015, wealthier nations committed to mobilizing $100 billion annually by 2020 to help vulnerable countries with mitigation and adaptation efforts. This target was met two years later in 2022 and as we are now in 2024, the Loss and Damages Fund pledge stands at over $700 million according to United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\n\nTeenagers taking action against climate change.

Multicultural young people joining the global climate strike.\n\nSea level rise is one of the most pressing issues on the COP agenda, especially for vulnerable coastal and island nations. As global temperatures increase, melting ice caps and expanding warm water are causing sea levels to rise at an alarming rate. This threatens to displace millions of people, erode coastlines, and damage critical infrastructure worldwide.\n\nAt recent COP conferences, rising sea levels have underscored the need for a Loss and Damage Fund, a financial mechanism that compensates countries experiencing irreversible climate impacts. The establishment of this fund at COP28 marked a significant milestone, providing hope for countries already facing devastating consequences from climate change. COP29, which is currently being held in Baku, Azerbaijan, aims to further operationalize this fund and build a new climate finance target to ensure that both mitigation and adaptation needs are met.\n\nAs climate change impacts become more pronounced, COP is aimed at providing a platform not only for negotiations but also for building partnerships, securing financial commitments, and enacting policies to address this global crisis. Ultimately, its outcomes has the ability to shape the future of climate policy and, ultimately, the quality of life on our planet and those who are significantly at risk."

Eddie Murphy as Axel Foley in Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F.\n\nWarning: Spoilers ahead for Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F on Netflix.\n\nEddie Murphy and the Beverly Hills Cop crew is back. The actor reprised his iconic role as Axel Foley for Netflix 's Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F. As you watch the film, you might have questions about what happens, including the action-packed ending that threatens the detective's life .\n\nBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F marks the fourth installment in the beloved franchise and the first movie in 30 years after Beverly Hills Cop (1984), Beverly Hills Cop II (1987), and Beverly Hills Cop III (1994). The story follows the detective as he teams up with his daughter and her ex-boyfriend to uncover a conspiracy at the BHPD.\n\n\"After his daughter's life is threatened, wisecracking Detective Axel Foley teams up with a new partner and some old pals to turn up the heat on a conspiracy,\" the official synopsis reads. Newcomers to the franchise include Taylour Paige as Axel's daughter Jane, Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Detective Bobby Abbott, Jane's ex-boyfriend, and Kevin Bacon as the corrupt BHPD Captain.\n\nBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F.  (L to R) Eddie Murphy as Axel Foley and Paul Reiser as Jeffrey in ... More Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F.  Cr.\n\nLike the previous films in the franchise, Axel F opens up with Axel driving down the streets of Detroit. He attends the Detroit Red Wings game with his colleague Mike Woody (Kyle S. More). They are there to track down thieves involved in a string of burglaries.\n\nAxel and Woody confront the robbers, who manage to get away with the help of corrupt security guards. Soon, they're chasing the criminals down the streets of Motown in a snowplow that's destroying everything in its path. Although they manage to stop the robbers, Alex is called to his boss' office - which happens to be his former friend and partner Jeffrey Friedman (Paul Reiser).\n\nFriedman tells Axel that he turned in his papers to protect Axel's job and to spend more time with his family. When Axel questions the latter, Jeffrey asks Axel when was the last time he spoke to his estranged daughter, Jane.\n\nBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F (L to R)  Taylour Paige as Jane Saunders in Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F.\n\nAlex goes to Beverly Hills after his old friend, Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) - now a private investigator - calls him to say that his daughter is in danger. Jane is working as a public defender and is representing an innocent man accused of murdering a police officer. She was inside her car when mask-wearing thugs dangled her vehicle out of a parking garage.\n\nRosewood tells Axel his daughter's fine, but these guys are serious and want her off the case. Axel sent his daughter to Beverly Hills as a child to protect her, so the concerned father books the next flight to see her and figure out what was going on.\n\nWhen Axel arrives, Billy mysteriously isn't there to pick him up. He goes to Billy's office to find two men ransacking the place. \"Billy has uncovered something that is pretty far-reaching and dangerous for the central characters, as well as a lot of people,\" Reinhold told Netflix's Tudum . \"He has to be very careful with the knowledge that he has. He's really on the hunt this time.\"\n\nAxel initially pretends to be one of them, but his identity is uncovered. He runs away and escapes in a parking enforcement vehicle (not before being sprayed with a massive amount of pepper spray by the officer). The bad guys chase him, and because he can't see very well, this causes mayhem in the streets as he almost hits a few pedestrians.\n\nBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F. (L to R) Kevin Bacon as Captain Cade Grant and Eddie Murphy as Axel F in ... More Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F.\n\nAxel is arrested and questioned by Detective Bobby Abbott (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). Bobby asks Axel why he was in Billy's office, but Axel only wants to speak with his old buddy John Taggart (John Ashton). Axel repeatedly calls his daughter, who finally agrees to help him get out of jail after he mentions Bobby's name.\n\nIt turns out that Taggart is now the chief of the Beverly Hills Police Department. In Taggart's office, Axel is introduced to Cade Grant, the interdepartmental narcotics task force leader. Taggart and the BHPD are prosecuting Jane's client Enrique, who allegedly killed an uncovered cop named Copeland. They tell Axel that Jane claims that Copeland was a dirty cop, but Taggart defends the officer and says he was one of his own.\n\nBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F.  (L to R) Taylour Paige as Jane, Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Detective Bobby ... More Abbott and Eddie Murphy as Axel Foley in Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F.\n\nAxel quickly suspects that Grant of the interdepartmental narcotics task force is involved in the scheme. Jane gave up on the case once she had enough evidence to provide reasonable doubt for her client. But Axel keeps going, and her father teams up with her ex-boyfriend, Bobby, to take down Grant, who is secretly running a drug smuggling operation.\n\nAxel and Bobby are arrested by cops and framed for cocaine possession. Thankfully, Axel outsmarts Grant to escape custody, and they bust out by stealing a police helicopter. The two rescue Rosewood shortly afterward, but they discover the worst news of all: Grant kidnapped Jane, and he's holding her hostage at his mansion, which also serves as the headquarters of his illegal operation.\n\nBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F. (L to R) Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Detective Bobby Abbott and Eddie Murphy ... More as Axel Foley in Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F.\n\nAt the end of Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F, Axel, Bobby, and Billy go to Grand's headquarters to rescue Jane. There's a shootout, and even Taggart is there to help defeat the corrupt cops.\n\nAxel confronts Grant and tells him to put his weapon down. When another corrupt cop sneaks up behind them, Jane shoots him, and Axel turns around to see what happened. With Axel off guard, Grant takes the opportunity to shoot Jane. Axel dives in front of her, taking the bullet and ultimately saving her life.\n\nAfter Axel is shot in his upper body, Jane kneels and tells him that everything is going to be okay. Axel is taken by paramedics and is put into an ambulance. A paramedic tells Jane that she will have to meet them at the hospital. \"He's gonna be alright,\" Bobby says while comforting her.\n\nBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F (L to R) Mark Pellegrino as Beck, Kevin Bacon as Captain Cade Grant and ... More James Preston Rogers as Kurtz in Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F.\n\nThankfully, Axel survives after being shot at the end of Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F. In the next scene, viewers see Axel alive at the hospital. In true Axel fashion, he manages to escape yet again to eat lunch at a diner nearby with his daughter.\n\nJane informs him that Billy's SD cart, with all the evidence from the case, was handed over to authorities, resulting in the District Attorney dropping all charges against her client. Axel apologizes to Jane, and they reconcile. Meanwhile, Axel gets ready to leave California, but before he does that, he orchestrates a heartfelt reunion with his friends.\n\nBilly and John are waiting outside Axel's hospital (at Jane's request) to ensure he doesn't cause any more trouble. Axel decides to surprise them and slides into the back seat. He tells his pals that he wants to get a steak. This nostalgic nighttime stakeout with Axel, Billy, and John is one of the many nods to the original film woven into Axel F. The scene closes out the sequel, leaving the door open for the franchise to continue.\n\n\"When we shot the scene where the three of us were in an unmarked car together, it was magical - not just for us, but there was an electricity with the crew, too, everybody,\" Reinhold told Netflix. \"It was like time travel. The first thing that Eddie said when he got in the back of the car - I hadn't seen him in at least 10 years - was, 'Well, we still resemble our characters.'\"\n\nBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F is streaming on Netflix.

      "text": "Cops And Donuts Go Together More Than You Thought: The Corporations Funding Cop City In Atlanta\n\nBy Morgan Simon\n\nBy Morgan Simon ,\n\nSenior Contributor.\n\nA demonstrator holds her hands up while she kneels in front of the Police at the Anaheim City Hall ... More on June 1, 2020 in Anaheim, California, during a peaceful protest over the death of George Floyd. - Major US cities - convulsed by protests, clashes with police and looting since the death in Minneapolis police custody of George Floyd a week ago - braced Monday for another night of unrest. More than 40 cities have imposed curfews after consecutive nights of tension that included looting and the trashing of parked cars. (Photo by Apu GOMES / AFP) (Photo by APU GOMES/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nCorporations loudly made billions of dollars in commitments to racial justice in the wake of the murder of George Floyd by police officers, often seeking the associated \"halo effect\" with an increasingly diverse consumer population in the US. What is less well-known, ironically, is their equal support of the expansion and increased militarization of police departments this past decade through organizations called police foundations in cities such as Atlanta, New York, Louisville and Los Angeles.\n\nWhile government funds deployed to police departments have public oversight and accountability mechanisms, police foundations do not - they are controlled by boards of directors, largely made up of officials from the corporations that fund them. A 2021 report by ColorofChange and LittleSis documented 1,200 corporations (including the parent corp of Dunkin Donuts , Atlanta-based Inspire Brands) funding 23 police foundations nationally for almost $60 million in 2019, the most recent year cited by the report.\n\nThis is why on June 18th of 2020, the same week of Rayshard Brook's funeral, the Atlanta Police Foundation was able to announce a $500 bonus for each police officer: they have funding independent from any government authority or accountability. As Fox News reported, it was a \"difficult time\" for police officers: \"Fulton County prosecutors brought felony murder and other charges against the now ex-officer who shot Rayshard Brooks, saying that Brooks was not a deadly threat and that the officer kicked the wounded black man and offered no medical treatment for over two minutes as he lay dying on the ground. Another officer is being charged with aggravated assault.\"\n\nThese payments collectively totaled over $2M. And yet, just a few months later, the city council voted unanimously to provide Mr. Brook's family with $1M as an attempt at compensation for the harm caused by police conduct. This might sound contradictory, except that the funding sources, decision-making structures and objectives are completely different between the City of Atlanta, which is responsible for its police force and accountable to the public, and the Atlanta Police Foundation, which aims to serve the police force and is only accountable to its board (and to some degree, the IRS for its charitable status).\n\nIt's worth taking a moment to consider how highly unusual a practice this is in American society more broadly. Can you imagine if politicians, like the Mayor of Atlanta or the Governor of Georgia, were allowed to accept bonuses from private foundations or corporate donors? Or if teachers at public schools could accept lavish gifts from parents or their employers? So why can police? And why can corporations?\n\nThe public has been learning more about these foundations: for instance, earlier this year, the LA Times covered the relatively hidden multi-million dollar fundraising arm of the LAPD. Is it any wonder, then, that with corporations and their executives bankrolling police foundations, problems like wage theft (where corporations illegally underpay already low-wage workers ) still vastly exceed all other types of property crime in the US ?\n\nCertainly, public servants like teachers and frontline healthcare workers barely making a living wage could perhaps benefit from some private support, but you don't hear news stories about corporations giving teachers millions too often. Corporations are generally assumed to donate where they expect to receive something in return, and perhaps a good relationship with a local police department has a better IRR.\n\nCop City and Corporate Funding\n\nDENVER, CO - MAY 30: Police officers pepper spray a woman next to the Colorado State Capitol as ... More protests against the death of George Floyd continue for a third night on May 30, 2020 in Denver, Colorado. The city of Denver enacted a curfew for Saturday and Sunday nights and Governor Jared Polis activated the Colorado National Guard in hopes of stopping protests that have wreaked havoc across the city. (Photo by Michael Ciaglo/Getty Images)\n\nIt's thanks to such corporations that the Atlanta Police Department, despite having only a $ 236M budget in 2022, was able to get approval for a $90M project dubbed \"Cop City.\" The proposal includes a plan to build an 85-acre facility in an unincorporated, forested area of DeKalb County that would serve as a training facility for Atlanta police.\n\nThe Atlanta Police Foundation agreed to fundraise $60M alongside the city's $30M . If the one who has (or donates) the gold makes the rules, this would structurally provide the corporate voices that govern the Atlanta Police Foundation an outsized voice in this project's future. As 11Alive (Atlanta's local NBC affiliate) noted : \"The Atlanta Police Foundation's Board is filled with executives from nearly all of Atlanta's big-name companies like Delta, Waffle House, the Home Depot, Georgia Pacific, Equifax EFX , Carter, Accenture ACN , Wells Fargo WFC and UPS, among others. It reads like a 'who's-who' of corporate Atlanta.\" And perhaps given its strong corporate support, the Atlanta Police Foundation is unusually well-funded, with more employees and the highest-paid executive of any police foundation earning over $476,000 a year.\n\nThere has been pitched opposition to the project for two reasons. First, people are concerned about the training tactics the facility would employ, which activists have called a \"police militarization facility.\" In what seems like unusually sensible NIMBY-ism, a fourth-generation resident noted at a local council meeting, \"I don't want my children to grow up hearing explosions\" as part of potential bomb training. Republican Governor Brian Kemp and Democratic Mayor of Atlanta, Andre Dickens, have dismissed opposition to the project as being from outsiders, but locals packed zoning board appeal meetings. The second, perhaps most critical objection to the project is its location. If built, the facility would require the destruction of up to 400 acres of the South River Forest, a vital headwater for and ecological keystone for the region. This adds insult to historic injury, given the land was already stolen from the Muscogee-Creek people , forced out during the US genocidal effort to relocate Native peoples to present-day Oklahoma - better known as the Trail of Tears.

The document states on page 20 that $46.3M had been raised so far.\n\nGiven that it has been extensively , publicly noted that the Cop City project, which the Atlanta Police Foundation refers to as the \"Public Safety Training Center,\" (or PSTC) has a $90M price tag, $30M to be contributed by the city of Atlanta, $60M by the foundation - the same arrangement laid out for the overall campaign - this report seemed to imply that $46.3M had raised been raised towards Cop City. The following are the corporate contributors (and more publicly-aligned foundations, full list here ) to the Public Safety First Campaign:\n\nBank of America BAC /Merrill Lynch - $360K\n\nChick-fil-A - $1M\n\nThe Coca-Cola KO Company - $1M\n\nJay Davis (National Distributing Company) - $100K\n\nGas South - $155K\n\nGeorgia Pacific - $250K\n\nBrent Scarborough Co. Inc. - $100K\n\nNorfolk Southern NSC - $100K\n\nTony Ressler (majority owner of the Atlanta Hawks NBA team) - $1M\n\nRollins - $5M\n\nAustin Stephens - $250K\n\nUPS - $1M\n\nIn response to a request for comment, however, two corporations, Bank of America and Gas South, explicitly clarified that their donations were earmarked for the At-Promise youth initiative and that neither corporation was funding the training center. (The other corporations and individuals on this list did not respond to a request for comment). So is this $60M going to the training facility or elsewhere? Atlanta Police Foundation did not respond to a request for comment. Finally, yet another document presented a pie chart noting that $30M of the campaign was destined for the training facility, but then that would imply that another $30M needed to be raised as well.\n\nClear as mud? Typically, major fundraising campaigns feature large public announcements and celebrations of progress made. But perhaps the controversy has led to less direct communication about which corporations and individuals are actually involved.\n\nCommunity members with the \"Stop Cop City\" movement, have filed an open records request with the Atlanta Police Foundation to gain more insight into exactly how much money has been confirmed for the training ground specifically (as opposed to ancillary projects). As a non-profit organization with IRS-mandated transparency requirements one would hope for greater clarity in such reporting, and for the corporations who do not want to be implicated in the controversy over cop city, clearer communication to the public to ensure they are not falsely implicated.\n\nPublic Safety or Corporate Safety?\n\nTraders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during the opening bell on March 10, 2020 ...

The index lost more than 2,000 points on Monday in its worst session since 2008. (Photo by TIMOTHY A. CLARY / AFP) (Photo by TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nCharitable giving is typically designed to address market failures (like the devaluing of nature) or to fill in where governments have proven ineffective (like solving hunger and homelessness). Charitable organizations receive tax-preferential status because they have a positive social mission approved by the IRS, for instance, protecting forests.\n\nIdeally, these missions are relatively uncontroversial-that is much trickier with police foundations. As research organization Little Sis noted, \"In 2011, JPMorgan gave the New York City Police Foundation $4.6 million, turning the NYPD into a militarized presence during Occupy Wall Street. Heidi Boghosian of the National Lawyers Guild said it created an appearance of 'the police protecting corporate interests rather than protecting the First Amendment rights of the people.'\" And while certainly the public is aligned on the need for public safety, this is often better achieved through more mental health and addiction services rather than more training in heavy-handed tactics .\n\nEven the best of nonprofits are fundamentally undemocratic, as they allow people with money (across the political spectrum) to prioritize their perspective of how a problem should be solved instead of letting leadership come from the communities that are most affected by any particular decision or social policy. And that's why democratically elected governments are, ideally, well-suited to collectively make decisions about resources (aka, our tax dollars) and try to address the public good. There's a reason why they call it \"public\" safety, not private safety.\n\nIf corporations want to do good, fantastic. Like all of us, they will never be perfect in figuring out the best path toward social change. But at the very least, they can honor their word, and most recently, their strongest words have been about racial justice.\n\nAnd that's perhaps why the apparent corporate funding of Cop City comes as such a surprise, given that Tony Ressler, Chick-fil-A, UPS, Coca-Cola, and Norfolk Southern have all made prior racial equity commitments in the wake of George Floyd's murder . For example, UPS talks about \"creating social impact, advancing diversity, equity and inclusion,\" and \"building stronger communities.\" Tony Ressler, owner of the Atlanta Hawks and founder of Apollo Global Management APO , has previously committed tens of millions to racial equity . Atlanta (and southern ) staple Coca-Cola promised to take a deep look at what it could do to \"end the cycle of systemic racism.\"Racial injustice and environmental racism are not easy problems to solve. But if these are problems, corporations are truly interested in addressing, it's understandable why people would question whether cutting down 85 acres of forest to likely encourage more aggressive police tactics is not the best place to start. There is broadly observed consensus that these kinds of projects take money away from programs like education, community support, and healthcare that do actually improve communities.\n\nInvestors have been taking note: a coalition of investors and advocates led by Justice Capital has reached out to several corporations such as UPS, Chick-fil-A and Coca Cola questioning their overall relationships with the Atlanta Police Foundation and potential involvement in the Cop City Project. Eric Glass of Justice Capital said, \"Corporations need to be consistent in word and deed. And we, the public, should hold them accountable for those words and deeds! Someone in the C-Suite needs to ask the question, 'Does contributing to a police foundation and/or a 'militarized' training facility' align with our proclamations and declarations around racial justice, as well as diversity, equity and inclusion?'\n\n\"Corporations need to answer to their customers and to the public writ large when they fail to walk the walk and talk the talk.\""

      "text": "Atlanta organizers unveil plan to stop 'Cop City' at the ballot box\n\nby R.J. RICO, Associated Press 06/07/23 12:55 PM ET\n\nHundreds of people gather in Atlanta's City Hall on Monday, June 5, 2023, to speak ahead of a council vote over whether to approve tens of millions in public funding for the construction of a proposed police and firefighter training center that activists decry as \"Cop City.\" More than 350 had signed up to speak during the meeting, with hundreds more unable to sign up in time, including a large crowd prevented from entering City Hall due to capacity concerns. (AP Photo/R.J. Rico)\n\nATLANTA (AP) - Activists announced an effort Wednesday to force a referendum that would allow Atlanta voters to decide whether the construction of a proposed police and firefighter training center should proceed, in a potential last-ditch effort to halt the project that its opponents refer to as \"Cop City.\"\n\nA day after the City Council rejected protesters' pleas to refuse to fund the training facility, the activists returned to City Hall to file a referendum petition, hoping to take the fight to the ballot box. Under the proposed referendum, voters would choose whether they want to repeal the ordinance that authorized the lease of the city-owned land upon which the project is set to be built.\n\nIn order for the language to get on the ballot, though, organizers must first gather the signatures of more than 70,000 Atlanta voters over 60 days once the city clerk approves the petition. They would also have to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars to pay canvassers to help them do that.\n\n\"The people need to have a voice in whether or not there is a Cop City,\" community organizer Kamau Franklin said during a news conference. \"The City Council has failed over and over again to listen to the masses of people in Atlanta. ... What (the council members) want is what the Atlanta Police Foundation wants, which is to continue to militarize police and to attack our movements and criminalize our people. We don't want that.\"\n\nAlex Joseph, a local attorney who is helping to lead the legal effort, said the referendum campaign is modeled after a successful effort in coastal Georgia, where Camden County residents voted overwhelmingly last year to block county officials from building a launchpad for blasting commercial rockets into space.\n\nThe Georgia Supreme Court in February unanimously upheld the legality of the Camden County referendum, though it remains an open question whether citizens can veto decisions of city governments. Joseph said she expects city officials to file legal challenges to try to halt the effort, but that she and other attorneys are working to ensure that the referendum passes legal muster.\n\nOpponents of the proposed training center say they need to gather the signatures of 15% of the approximately 469,000 city residents who were registered to vote in the last election, which would be 70,330 signatures. About 97,000 people voted in the first round of the city's 2021 mayoral race. Among the groups backing the effort are the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and the Working Families Party.\n\nConstruction crews have already begun clearing wide swaths of the overgrown, urban forest in unincorporated DeKalb County ahead of the planned construction of the 85-acre (34-hectare) campus. Project opponents said they plan to seek a court order to halt the work pending the outcome of their proposed referendum.\n\nCity officials say the $90 million facility would replace inadequate training facilities and would help address difficulties in hiring and retaining police officers that worsened after nationwide protests against police brutality and racial injustice three years ago.\n\nBut opponents, who have been joined by activists from around the country, say they fear it will lead to greater militarization of the police and that its construction will exacerbate environmental damage in a poor, majority-Black area.\n\nThe \"Stop Cop City\" effort has gone on for more than two years and at times has veered into vandalism and violence, with protesters having been accused of throwing rocks and Molotov cocktails at law enforcement officers.\n\nMore than 350 people signed up Monday afternoon to deliver impassioned speeches against the facility, with testimony inside the City Council chamber lasting so long - more than 14 hours - that the 11-4 vote in favor of funding the facility did not take place until around 5:30 a.m. the next morning.\n\nHaving been unable to convince the council to halt the project, activists said it's time for activists to make the case to the larger public.\n\n\"The exciting thing about the referendum is that it's a silver bullet,\" Joseph said. \"If we win, it shuts down the project.\"\n\nAs approved by the City Council in September 2021, the land is being leased to the private Atlanta Police Foundation for $10 a year. The proposed referendum would seek to cancel that agreement.\n\nAtlanta native and local organizer Clara Totenberg Green said gathering enough signatures in time will be difficult, but she thinks it's doable.\n\n\"There are hundreds, thousands of folks that are mobilized and ready to act,\" Green said. \"We can absolutely get the signatures. The challenge is the fast turnaround, but we can do it. People are ready.\""

For Ice-T, it led to a heated showdown with a New Jersey cop.\n\nThe 66-year-old rapper was stopped last May for driving his Porsche with tags that hadn't been updated in over three years.\n\nIn newly released bodycam footage, which was shared on Thursday, January 2 via YouTube , the officer is heard informing Ice-T, whose real name is Tracy Marrow, \"You know your registration [has been] expired since 2021?\"\n\nThe Law & Order: SVU star replied, \"That's where I'm going,\" adding, \"Yesterday I went to the DMV, and they said their system's down. So, that's where I'm headed.\"\n\nThe officer then stated, \"You need to have an appointment to go to the DMV.\" Without skipping a beat, Ice-T declared, \"I don't need one. They know me.\"\n\nBut the cop wasn't buying it and threatened to tow the car. \"You're not finna tow my f***ing vehicle,\" the actor said before stepping out of his vehicle. \"If I'm not under arrest, I'm getting out of the car.\" That's when things got tense.\n\n\"Give me my paperwork, you f***ing a**hole,\" Ice-T demanded. \"Give me my f***ing paperwork. Get this on camera. I'm a foot away from the DMV.

I'm telling you to keep your distance!\"\n\nThings eventually calmed down when another cop from the Judson County Sheriff's Office arrived and worked to de-escalate the situation. The sergeant even tried to convince the patrol officer to write fewer tickets, but the cop stuck to his guns, issuing Ice-T four citations: expired registration, driving with a suspended license, no inspection sticker, and missing front plates.\n\nThe officer handed over Ice-T's keys and ended the interaction with, \"Just next time show some respect.\" Staying true to his unfiltered style, the hip-hop artist responded, \"I don't have to.\"\n\nMaggie Ekberg is a Newsweek writer based in Tampa, FL.

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nThe family of a man killed by a police officer in April has released new graphic footage of the shooting.\n\nThe shooting, which took place on April 11 in San Marcos, Texas, resulted in the death of 22-year-old Malachi Williams at the hands of an officer from the San Marcos Police Department (SMPD), as reported by KTBC in Austin.\n\nPublic trust in police officers has been steadily declining in recent years, driven by high-profile incidents of police misconduct, racial profiling and use of excessive force. These cases have sparked nationwide protests and prompted calls for reform, as communities across the country demand greater transparency and accountability from law enforcement agencies. Surveys indicate that confidence in the police varies significantly by demographic, with Black and Hispanic Americans expressing lower levels of trust compared to white Americans.\n\nFour months after the shooting, a Hays County grand jury found the officer, Alcides \"Alex\" Ventura, to be justified in his use of force.\n\nHowever, despite the grand jury's decision, Williams' family has been steadfast in their search for justice, starting the justice for Malachi group and airing never-before-seen footage of his death which the family says casts doubt on the narrative shown on initial footage from police body cameras.\n\nInitial bodycam footage released in August from the shooting shows Williams running from the police, and Ventura attempting to stop him with a taser before deploying his gun.\n\nPer a press release from Hays County following the grand jury ruling, Ventura was attempting to apprehend Williams after he was thought to be involved in an incident earlier that night where he allegedly threatened two people with knives.\n\nThe initial bodycam footage aired on KTBC shows Williams failing to comply with police orders to put his hands behind his back.\n\nThe footage from August then shows Williams running toward an open grocery store. According to Ventura, he was carrying two knives, although that is unclear from the footage.\n\nPer the Hays County press release, and the corresponding bodycam footage, Officer Ventura attempted to deploy his taser twice, before shooting and killing Williams.\n\nHays County Attorney General Kelly Higgins said in August: \"We are saddened by the loss of life, but the actions of Mr. Williams posed a threat to public safety. This officer was forced to make a difficult decision in order to protect the public.\"\n\nThe new footage which was released by Malachi William's family and aired on KTBC is made up of witness video and video from outside the Snax Max convenience store where Williams was initially apprehended.\n\nThe family says these videos show a different chain of events than the body camera and what was previously stated by the grand jury.\n\nWhile the originally released footage shows Ventura outside of the Snax Max attempting to talk down Williams, and then Williams running away from him (from the point of view of the officer's body camera), CCTV from outside of the Snax Max shows Ventura clearly pulling out his gun while talking to Williams, an act the family says likely contributed to Williams' decision to run away from the officer.\n\nWilliams' grandfather, Wayne Miller, told KTBC: \"The narrative so far is, prior to seeing this, was that...they had to take him outside of the store because he was too dangerous to apprehend him in the store.\n\n\"But it shows us they only wanted to take him outside of the store to intimidate him.\"\n\nThe Hays County communications manager told Newsweek : \"The county has no comment on the matter.\"\n\nThe SMPD responded to Newsweek's request for comment with a link to its August press conference and original body cam footage from August, as well as with pictures of Williams carrying an object it said could be one of the knives that Ventura said he was carrying.\n\nWilliams' family also released a second video of the scene after he was shot. This video shows officers around Williams who is blurred out in the footage but is said to be lying on the ground. In this footage, one of the officers appears to kick Williams while another officer kneels nearby and two additional officers stand and walk around in the area. It is unclear from the video what the kneeling officer is doing because of the blurred section.\n\nMiller told KTBC: \"There was basically no rendering of medical aid. There was no compassion. No empathy. \"\n\nThis is counter to the narrative put out by Hays County review, conducted by the SMPD and the Texas Rangers, which reported: \"Despite attempts at life saving measures, [Williams] did not survive.\"\n\nSMPD Chief Stan Standridge said in a press conference earlier in the year: \"Multiple officers arrived and a fire marshal. Thankfully, the fire marshal is also a certified paramedic, so the paramedic was on scene literally within a minute or less and began providing aid.\"\n\nThis new footage has been released in the wake of several high-profile police shooting cases in Texas.\n\nOfficer Christopher Taylor of the Austin Police Department was just found guilty of deadly conduct in a shooting that was deemed to be \"completely avoidable.\"\n\nAdditionally, the case of Texas Constable Roberto Felix Jr., who was cleared of charges regarding the shooting of an unarmed man in 2016, is headed to the Supreme Court for a review under a civil rights claim.\n\nIt is unclear whether this new footage will reopen Williams' case, as it was declared closed after the grand jury decision in August.\n\nDo you have a story we should be covering?

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nThe Miami-Dade Police officer placed on administrative leave for his involvement in the viral Tyreek Hill traffic stop incident has a long history of use of force, suspensions, and written reprimands throughout his nearly 28-year tenure.\n\nAccording to Officer Danny Torres' personnel file reviewed by Newsweek , Torres, who forcefully pulled the Miami Dolphins wide receiver from his car on September 8, has been suspended from the police department six times since his October 7, 1996 hire date.\n\nWhile specific details on each of these suspensions are not included in the personnel file, Torres' suspensions have ranged from five to 20 days.\n\nHis first use of force incident occurred on February 12, 2002, in the Miami Hammocks District.\n\nTorres has received written reprimands on four occasions, though one was later rescinded. He received his latest written reprimand on September 30, 2020.\n\nTorres' file, however, also boasts more than 30 commendations throughout his career. His awarded recognitions include professionalism and dedication to duty (May 2023), as well as safe driving (2017, 2019, 2020, and 2022).\n\nNewsweek has contacted the Miami-Dade PD for more information.\n\nIn a press conference last week, Hill admitted he should've followed police commands and kept his car window rolled down as instructed before the traffic stop quickly escalated.\n\n\"I will say I could have been better,\" Hill said. \"I could have let down my window in that instant. But the thing about me is, I don't want attention. I don't want to be cameras-out, phones-on-you in that moment. But at the end of the day, I'm human. I've got to follow rules. I've got to do what everyone else would do.\"\n\nHill added, \"Now, does that give them the right to literally beat the dog out of me? Absolutely not,\" Hill said. \"But at the end of the day, I wish I could go back and do things a bit differently.\"\n\nHill also repeated his call for Torres to be fired .\n\n\"Gone. Gone. Gone. Gone. Gone. He's gotta go, man,\" Hill said of Torres. \"In that instant right there, not only did he treat me bad, but he also treated my teammates with disrespect. He had some crazy words towards them and they didn't even do nothing. Like, what did they do to you? They're just walking on the sidewalk. He's got to go, man.\"\n\nLast week, the office of Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava told Newsweek that \"the body-worn camera footage from the incident involving Tyreek Hill makes it clear that the detaining officer acted in deeply troubling ways that warrant a full internal review.\"\n\n\"Miami-Dade County is committed to upholding trust between law enforcement and the community we serve, and to do that it's critical we ensure there is accountability for any officer who is found to use unnecessary force.\"\n\nNewsweek spoke with two police experts about Torres' personnel file.\n\nBoth Thaddeus Johnson and Andrew J. Scott agreed that officers could be suspended for \"anything\" ranging from putting on handcuffs too tight or falling asleep on the job to driving that resulted in a serious crash, or the inappropriate use of force.\n\nThey both agreed Torres' personnel file does not provide specific information explaining what Torres did to be suspended.\n\n\"One could say that perhaps he's a little handsy at the very least in his career,\" Johnson, a former law enforcement official in Memphis and Senior Fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice, reacted about the multiple \"push/pull\" acts of force listed in the provided documents. \"But it's really hard to tell just based on that personnel file.\"\n\nScott, a former Boca Raton Police Chief , noted that Torres' two September 2016 suspensions being within two weeks of each other, if printed correctly, are \"concerning.\" He also said the amount of time Torres has been suspended is \"above average\" for officers with a nearly 30-year career.\n\n\"I know hundreds, thousands of police officers over the course of my career. I have never come across an officer that has had that many suspensions in that period of time,\" Scott told Newsweek .\n\n\"I've had officers and friends that are officers that have been suspended, but maybe that occurs once or twice in their career.\"\n\nScott maintains that the force Torres used to get Hill out of his McLaren \"was not inappropriate\" but can understand the department's decision to place Torres on leave \"due to his history.\"\n\nJohnson, on the other hand, did not think Hill's traffic stop warranted such a rough reaction from Torres.\n\n\"That was a level of aggression that was quite surprising to me,\" he said. \"I have been part of things where people need to get the vehicles because I'm gonna make an arrest or that we have probable cause that something is going on, but I'm not just doing it for traffic tickets.\"\n\n\"Things can be lawful and still be awful, and I feel like this is one of those things,\" Johnson added.\n\n\"Did he do anything that I deem unlawful? Eh,\" Johnson pondered. \"Does his record and now seeing this behavior make you wonder what he does when the cameras are not on? It's natural to have those questions.\"\n\nBoth experts agree that Torres should receive remedial training for the Hill incident and said it wouldn't be a bad idea for the department to evaluate whether he'd be better suited for a different unit.\n\nJohnson said, \"It might be difficult for him even with some of his fellow officers who may not quite agree with his behavior to come back into the field like nothing ever happened.\"\n\n\"I don't think people are going to try to hurt him, I just think that his legitimacy has taken a hit. I think that if he interacts with citizens, they're going to remember that camera image and might be more nervous if he pulls them over. I would be afraid,\" he added.\n\nScott said he doesn't think he needs to lose his job.\n\n\"If we're seeing a pattern of overreaction to certain things of which he winds up being remanded, then there may be a necessity to remediate into significant training or transferring him away from his position as a motorman and relocate him maybe back into patrol or to some other type of duties that would take him away from dealing with traffic violators of that nature.\n\n\"I don't think suspensions would be appropriate here, but do I think he should lose his job? No,\" Scott said.\n\nDo you have a story Newsweek should be covering? Do you have any questions about this story?

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nA former police officer and ex-investigator for the U.S. Center for SafeSport has been arrested on charges of rape and sex trafficking . The charges are tied to his time as an officer in Allentown, Pennsylvania .\n\nJason Krasley left policing and started work for the department, founded to deal with sexual abuse cases in Olympic and Paralympic sports, in 2021, later being fired after it transpired he had allegedly stolen $5,500 from a drug bust he helped conduct while on the force.\n\nNewsweek has contacted James Burke, Krasley's attorney by email for comment.\n\nIf the allegations prove to be true, Krasley's time at SafeSport will raise severe questions about their hiring practices. The Denver -based organization has emphasized its rigorous vetting process, including third-party background checks and annual criminal history screenings. Despite these claims, Krasley, 47, was hired while under investigation for allegedly stealing $5,500 from a drug bust in 2019 during his tenure as a police officer. He was dismissed from SafeSport last year when those charges surfaced publicly.\n\nThe organization receives approximately 155 reports of misconduct weekly. Krasley is also named in a whistleblower lawsuit filed last year by two Allentown officers who alleged widespread misconduct in the department.\n\nBoth Krasley and current Allentown officer Kevin Weaver, 45, who was also arrested, are accused felony rape and involuntary sexual servitude to the same victim between 2011 and 2015. If convicted, they could face life in prison.\n\nKrasley served as a detective in Allentown for nearly two decades before joining SafeSport. Public records show that in 2019, he was accused of stealing seized cash during a drug raid. Despite this, Krasley managed to secure a position at SafeSport investigating sensitive cases of abuse and misconduct.\n\nThe investigation that led to Krasley's most recent arrest revealed that he and Weaver reportedly sexually assaulted the same victim multiple times. SafeSport, which did not disclose the exact number of cases Krasley handled, has acknowledged that some victims have expressed concerns about his conduct.\n\nClaimant Kirsten Hawkes , said that her case was mishandled by Krasley, who she said became dismissive of her allegations of child abuse by a coach \"They have the resources to call a police department and say 'Hey we're hiring him for a semi-government job handling sensitive information, anything we should know?'\" Hawkes added \"It might not show up on a background check, but they should at least do the due diligence on digging a little bit further.\"\n\nSafeSport CEO Ju'Riese Colon said in a statement \"I am appalled that a former staff member has been accused of such heinous acts in his previous role as a police officer.\" She added \"We hold all staff to the highest standard because safeguarding athletes is our utmost priority.\"\n\n\"We are working with subject matter experts to determine what additional actions should be taken in light of the new allegations,\" she said.\n\nA spokesperson for SafeSport said in reply to Newsweek's request for a comment \"The U.S. Center for SafeSport requires a thorough background check of all prospective employees by an independent third-party known nationally for its work in vetting candidates, which includes multiple levels of screening related to criminal and sex offender registry history-this check is repeated annually for all active employees.\" They added \"We take this matter seriously and are assessing the situation to determine what, if any, additional vetting could have prevented this individual from being eligible for hire.\"\n\nJames Burke, Krasley's attorney , told l ehighvalleylive his client \"absolutely denies the allegations.\"\n\nA preliminary hearing for Krasley is scheduled for Jan. 29. Krasley faces additional counts of felony kidnapping, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and intimidation of a witness, in addition to misdemeanor criminal coercion. Allentown officer Weaver has been placed on administrative leave. SafeSport is expected to release findings from its audit of Krasley's cases in the coming months.\n\nThis article includes reporting from The Associated Press\n\nShannon McDonagh is a Newsweek content reporter based in London.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nThe Kentucky police officer that arrested No. 1 golfer Scottie Scheffler finally broke his silence on Thursday, calling it a \"chaotic situation for everyone involved\" and discussing his \"freaking $80 pants.\"\n\nScheffler, 27, was attempting to enter the Valhalla Golf Club in the early morning of May 17 in Louisville, Kentucky, to compete in Round 2 of the PGA Championship. He was detained around 6 a.m. for allegedly driving through a police cordon at the site of a fatal car accident outside of the golf club.\n\nThe accident was not related to Scheffler. A man, who worked at Valhalla, died.\n\nDetective Bryan Gillis stands by the fact that he was \"drug by the car\" and \"went to the ground.\"\n\n\"I received visible injuries to my knees and wrist,\" Gillis wrote in a statement. \"I'm going to recover from it, and it will be ok.\"\n\nSocial media is poking fun at Gillis mentioning his pants that \"were indeed ruined.\"\n\n\"Yes, the department has us buying freaking $80 pants,\" Gillis wrote in a postscript. \"But Scottie, it's all good. I never would've guessed I'd have the most famous pair of pants in the country for a few weeks because of this.\"\n\nGillis, who has worked at the police department for about 20 years, said that is the \"extent\" of his commentary on the incident.\n\nThe Louisville Metro Police Department released two videos last week , including one from a dash camera from a police car that showed a long line of cars passing the officers and their vehicles throughout the morning.\n\nOfficers stopped traffic momentarily, moving some of their cars and the bus that was involved in the crash. A van goes around the bus and through where the police are at 6 a.m. One officer was waving on the van. The situation after is not seen in the dash camera's view.\n\nAnother car had gone the same direction prior to the bus moving just a minute prior. An officer motioned with his arms for where that car should go.\n\nIn the second released video, from the road, the car is seen making its way through the police. One officer runs up to the vehicle and seems to throw himself onto the front door. The officer continuously reaches into the window of the driver's seat, even putting his head and shoulders through the window. After the officer emerges, other officers surround the car as well.\n\nThe car did not move again once the officer was interacting with it.\n\nGillis grabbed a hold of the car and Scheffler allegedly dragged him for several yards.\n\nGillis was injured when Scheffler \"refused to comply\" with instructions and \"accelerated forward,\" according to the incident report. Gillis, however, did not activate his body camera .\n\n\"Due to the confusion in the area at the time, his sense of urgency in responding to the fatal MVA and expediting traffic for the PGA championship, he failed to comply with powering it on,\" according to comments from Gillis's supervisor, Jeremy Allen.\n\nLouisville Metro Police Department policy requires officers to \"maintain their [body cameras] in a constant state of operational readiness\" and for them to \"immediately activate their [cameras] in recording mode prior to engaging in all law enforcement activities or encounters.\"\n\nAt a press conference last week, Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel and Mayor Craig Greenberg announced how they \"want to move forward\" especially now that Gillis has gone through \"corrective action for\" the body camera policy.\n\nProsecutors dropped the charges against Scheffler Wednesday. Jefferson County Attorney Mike O'Connell pointed to laws in Kentucky that require prosecutors to \"refrain from prosecuting charge the prosecutor knows is not probable.\" He said Scheffler's claim that the incident was a \"big misunderstanding\" is corroborated with the evidence.\n\nScheffler said in a statement Wednesday that he holds \"no ill will toward Officer Gillis\" and wishes to put this \"incident behind me and move on.\"\n\n\"The reality is that there are more important things in the world right now than a back-and-forth over this,\" his statement said. \"At the end of the day, I take pride in working for the people in the community to preserve their safety.\"\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nMonica is a Newsweek reporter based in Boston.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nA fugitive featured on America's Most Wanted was found working as a police officer in Mexico.\n\nAntonio Riano, 72, had been on Ohio's most wanted fugitive list for nearly 20 years. He was being sought for the shooting death of Benjamin Becarra, 25, in Butler County, Ohio, in 2004.\n\nU.S. Marshals arrested Riano on August 1 in his hometown of Zapotitlan Palmas, Oaxaca, Mexico, where he was working as a police officer. A photo released after the capture shows Riano in his blue police cap and jacket.\n\nA U.S. Marshals Service press release stated that they were working on the case with the Butler County Prosecutor's Office. Riano made his first court appearance in Ohio on Monday, and a judge ordered that he be held in jail without bond. He faces two charges of murder and one count of felony assault.\n\nThe release said that Riano was wanted for \"the shooting death of Benjamin Becarra, age 25, that occurred in December of 2004. After the shooting, Riano allegedly fled the United States to avoid prosecution.\"\n\n\"Riano was listed as one of the Butler County Sheriff's Office 'Most Wanted' and was profiled on the America's Most Wanted television series in 2005.\"\n\nRiano allegedly shot Becarra in the face following an argument inside and then outside of the Round House bar in Hamilton, Ohio, on the afternoon of December 19, 2004, Fox 19 Cincinnati reported this week.\n\nBecarra was allegedly in a fight at the bar a few weeks earlier, so when he reappeared on December 19, the bartender asked Becarra to leave, Paul Newton, the prosecutor's chief investigator, told the news station.\n\nRiano came to the assistance of the bartender and had a heated argument with Becarra, Newton said. The bartender asked the two to take it outside and Riano allegedly shot Becarra moments later. CCTV footage from the bar showed Riano fleeing in his van.\n\nPolice found the gun 10 days later \"hidden in a secret compartment under the kitchen floor of his Hamilton apartment that was on East Avenue near the bar,\" Fox 19 reported.\n\nThe Marshals Service said it received help from Mexican authorities in capturing Riano.\n\n\"Over 20 years after the shooting the Butler County Prosecutor's Office teamed up with the U.S. Marshals Service and the U.S. Department of Justice 's Office of International Affairs who worked with law enforcement partners in Mexico to secure the arrest and extradition of Riano.\"\n\nThe statement continued: \"On August 1, 2024, Deputy U.S. Marshals took custody of Riano from Mexican authorities in Mexico City. He was flown to Cincinnati and then transported to the Butler County Jail where he remains pending court proceedings.\"\n\nAccording to a 2019 article in Police Magazine , officers in Oaxaca \"often retire in their 80s or even 90s because they cannot afford to live off the minuscule pensions the government provides,\" which may explain Riano's continued presence in the force.\n\nSean O'Driscoll is a Newsweek Senior Crime and Courts Reporter based in Ireland.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nThe name of the Miami-Dade Police officer placed on administrative leave after Miami Dolphins player Tyreek Hill was detained Sunday has been released.\n\n\"Officer Danny Torres, 27-year tenure, remains on administrative duties, as the Internal Affairs investigation is still ongoing,\" a Miami-Dade PD spokesperson told Newsweek on Tuesday. \"We will provide further information once it becomes available pending the outcome of the investigation.\"\n\nHill, 30, received two citations on Sunday: One for careless driving and another for not wearing his seatbelt. Copies of the citations provided to Newsweek state Hill was traveling at a \"high rate of speed\" with a \"visual estimation of 60 mph\" in a \"high traffic of pedestrians and vehicles\" area.\n\nHill was penalized $179 for the careless driving citation and $129 for the seatbelt violation. Officer Manuel Batista signed both citations.\n\nThese new details come after Hill was stopped while driving to the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens where the Dolphins played their season opener against the Jacksonville Jaguars . During the stop, he was roughly handcuffed and placed on the ground with several officers around him.\n\nAlthough briefly detained, Hill was released in time to continue to the Dolphins' win where he even poked fun at the incident during a touchdown celebration.\n\nAfter reviewing the police body camera footage of Hill's detainment, former Boca Raton Police Chief Andrew J. Scott told Newsweek on Tuesday, \"I don't think any of the officers did anything wrong .\"\n\nBody cam footage shows officers repeatedly asking the NFLer to roll down his tinted car window, but Hill does not comply and rolls the window up.\n\n\"Had Mr. Hill complied with the officer's request initially, and kept his window down, and listened to what the officer said, he would have been on his way in a matter of 10 minutes, gotten his citations, and moved on. That did not happen,\" said Scott, who testifies across the country on police practices and procedures, including the use of force.\n\nScott continued, \"As a well-trained police officer, this is now a potentially dangerous situation for me. I can't see the driver. He's not following commands. He's in a 5000-pound vehicle that he could speed away. Maybe he's going to grab a weapon. I'm concerned. Let me pull him out and get him onto the ground, and let's find out what's going on.\"\n\nAnother segment of the body cam footage shows officers commanding a handcuffed Hill to sit down on the sidewalk. One officer holds Hill's shoulder while another comes up behind him, grabs him around the back to the front of his chest, and seats him on the pavement.\n\n\"Hold on, brah. I just had surgery on my knee! I just had surgery on my knee,\" Hill exclaims.\n\nScott says of the scene, \"He [the officer] doesn't push him down. He doesn't throw him down. He places him on the sidewalk to make sure that Mr. Hill is complying with what is being requested.\"\n\n\"Having said all of that, I'm not seeing anything in the body-worn cameras that would cause me to say my officers overreacted or my officers didn't do what their training suggested that they should do,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Neill Franklin , the former Baltimore City Police Department Commissioner and Maryland State Police Department veteran appeared on CNN on Tuesday, claiming Miami-Dade police actually \"escalated\" the incident.\n\n\"When they were trying to get him to sit down and he says he just had surgery on his knee, one officer responds, saying something to the effect of 'What a coincidence. Did you just have surgery on your ears?' You know, talking about him not listening to them right away.\"\n\n\"This is appalling, and this is one of the main problems we have in policing today - that police officers are not following their training,\" he continued. \"They're not using de-escalation techniques that they're trained in, and in this particular case, as I said before, they actually escalated the situation.\"\n\nFranklin went on, \"They had his driver's license. They knew who he was and where he was going. There was absolutely no reasonable suspicion whatsoever to believe that their safety was at risk, so for them to even have him step out of the car ... what they did was completely against training. It did not follow case law for the reasoning they used to get him out of the car. Their safety was not at risk.\"\n\nDo you have a story Newsweek should be covering?

Devon's video of the mock confrontation has been viewed 1.7 million times online. He summarized the clip in text overlay: \"Ticketed a cop for his janky parking!\"\n\nIt started with the student carrying a handwritten \"parking ticket\" on a lined piece of notebook paper. The page, which was riddled with misspellings, indicated that the date was \"Today\" and the infraction was \"Illigeal Parking Vialation.\" The fee owed for this offense was marked \"69.69$.\"\n\nArmed with this note, Devon marched up to a police car that was parked on the sidewalk.\n\n\"Evening, officer. Know why I've stopped you today?\" he asked, knocking on the car window. \"Illegal parking.\"\n\nThe officer rolled down his window and took the piece of paper from the young man.\n\n\"Citizen's arrest,\" Devon added, as the officer slowly looked over the document. \"Oh, how the turntables have turned!\"\n\nFinally, the inscrutable cop broke his silence. \"Bro, this is a disaster,\" he said, attempting to sound out the misspelled words. \"Ill-i-geal? Via-la-tion? 69.69 dollar sign?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I mean, you owe me $69 now,\" the student said, starting to chuckle.\n\n\"Who's your English teacher?\" the cop asked.\n\n\"Ms. Rodriguez,\" Devon replied.\n\n\"I'm gonna go pay her a visit,\" the officer said dryly, as Devon's act broke and he gave in to laughter.\n\nViewers were tickled by the encounter, with several appreciating the officer's good-humored response.\n\n\"He's already preparing the warrant for Ms. Rodriguez,\" one commenter said.\n\n\"I like how he wasn't an a**hole about it,\" another added.\n\n\"How can this not make a cop's day though,\" said another viewer. \"A harmless joke interacting with [the] community, love it.\"\n\nOthers noted that with a different police officer, the interaction could have turned out much worse.\n\n\"It's funny until he pulls the Uno reverse card and tickets you for impersonating a cop,\" one viewer noted.\n\nDevon revealed in the comments section that he was a student in Brentwood, California. A few commenters said they went to the same school and recognized the cop as a youth liaison officer.\n\nThe history of School-Police partnerships in the United States goes back to 1948, when the Los Angeles School Police Department was formed to patrol and protect schools in newly desegregated areas. In 1958, law enforcement officers were permanently assigned to schools in Flint, Michigan, as part of a strategy to improve relationships between police and youth-a program that became a model for school-based officer programs throughout the country.\n\nIn recent years, schools and advocacy groups have pushed for better documentation and clearer definitions of the partnership between officers and schools, according to the National Policing Institute . A 2021 analysis of data from the U.S. Department of Education by The Center for Public Integrity found that school policing disproportionately affected Black students and students with disabilities during the 2017-18 school year.\n\nNewsweek reached out to Devon for comment.\n\nShira Li Bartov is a Newsweek reporter based in New York.

Kapitanski was on duty as a sergeant with the Shelburne Police Department at the time of the incident.\n\nState police reviewed Kapitanski's tablet and found multiple YouTube addresses accessed in the 11 minutes leading up to the crash, according to a charging document obtained by VTDigger. The last video the officer allegedly accessed was entitled, \"Trans woman CONFRONTING Matt Walsh takes UNEXPECTED turn.\"\n\nKapitanski is accused of striking 38-year-old Sean Hayes with a police cruiser in November of last year. Hayes was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nIn the charging document, Vermont State Police Detective Sergeant Steven Gelder said Kapitanski was driving his cruiser south on Shelburne Road in South Burlington at around 2:40 a.m. Kapitanski called dispatch to report that he had hit something, \"possibly a person.\"\n\nThe crash was not captured on Kapitanski's body camera or the police cruiser's camera, but the body camera did capture some \"post-collision\" activity.\n\nThe camera showed the in-car mounted tablet, which allegedly had a web browser for a YouTube video on it.\n\n\"Kapitanski's hand can be seen changing the tablet's display screen, after the collision, from the YouTube web site to Valcour which is a computer-aided dispatch (CAD) screen,\" Gelder wrote in the charging document.\n\nZachary Nebeker of the state police's technology investigation unit confirmed that YouTube videos were visible on the tablet from 2:29 a.m. to 2:40 a.m. Kapitanski struck Hayes at around 2:40 a.m.\n\nNebeker said that there was \"no evidence of user interaction\" with the tablet during those 11 minutes.\n\nKapitanski was traveling 5 mph over the speed limit at the time of the crash, according to the charging document.\n\n\"The crash reconstruction report states the crash likely could have been avoided if Kapitanski was traveling at the speed limit,\" Gelder said in the charging document.\n\nDavid Sleigh, Kapitanski's attorney, in a statement to VTDigger: \"The affidavit, as near as I can see it, says that Kyle was going maybe 5 miles over the speed limit, that his computer was playing some sort of video, but the officer says that their IT guy says there doesn't appear to be any interaction with the computer in the 11 minutes that matter.\"\n\nChittenden County State's Attorney Sarah George, in a statement to VTDigger: \"The Court has found probable cause for the charge and we stand by our decision to file that charge.\"\n\nKapitanski is expected to be arraigned in Chittenden County criminal court on Thursday.\n\nDo you have a story Newsweek should be covering?

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nNew York's finest are leaving the force in record numbers, and it's not hard to understand why. They make enormous sacrifices and put their lives on the line every day for this city, and in return they get hung out to dry by self-interested politicians and denigrated by corporate executives seeking to prove how \"woke\" they are.\n\nI know all about the sacrifices police officers make for their community. My husband, Jason Rivera, was killed in the line of duty earlier this year, along with his partner, Wilbert Mora. Jason was a rookie cop. We had been married for a little over three months when I got the call that every police officer's family dreads.\n\nThe loved ones of police officers are acutely aware of the risk of loss. We accept that our husbands, wives, fathers, mothers, brothers, and sisters are answering a higher calling, and because they are willing to risk injury and death to help make their communities better places to live, we find a way to accept that risk, too.\n\nBut I can never just accept what happened to Jason, because it never should have happened.\n\nOn January 21, 2022, Jason and his partner responded to a domestic violence call in Harlem. The perpetrator, Lashawn McNeil, had a long rap sheet and was on probation for a felony drug conviction. He should not have been out of prison.\n\nInstead of being confined to a prison cell, however, McNeil was lying in wait, heavily armed, in a back bedroom at the end of a 30-foot hallway. When Jason and Wilbert approached the room, McNeil swung open the door and opened fire, shooting both of them in the head. Jason died that day, and Wilbert succumbed to his injuries four days later.\n\nMy husband and his partner died at the hands of a hardened criminal, but blame also rests with the craven politicians and \"woke\" corporate executives who are enabling and encouraging a culture of violent hostility toward police officers.\n\nProsecutors like New York District Attorney Alvin Bragg openly side with criminals, refusing to prosecute certain crimes and letting criminals off easy on others. Bragg and other soft-on-crime prosecutors are currying favor with radicals who see criminals as the real victims. But they're not. My husband and his partner were the real victims. The men and women of New York, who are facing a resurgence of violent crime after decades of relative safety, are the real victims.\n\nDA Bragg isn't solely to blame, of course. The radicals who put him in office-particularly the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation (BLMGNF)-bear at least as much responsibility.\n\nAnd it's impossible to separate groups like the BLMGNF from the corporate sponsors that bankroll their efforts to coddle criminals and stir up violent hatred against police officers.\n\nCoca-Cola, Comcast/NBC, Gatorade, Levi's, Microsoft , Nike, PayPal, Peloton, and Target-all have given financial or rhetorical support to the BLMGNF and other radical cop-hating groups. Their support of these groups makes them complicit in the attacks being carried out against police officers in New York and all over the country.\n\nThese brands are cultural icons. Their support for anti-cop radicals makes it seem as if society itself is turning against the police who risk their lives to keep us safe. It's no wonder that police officers in New York City and elsewhere are leaving the force in record numbers . Why would anyone put their life on the line for people who don't want their help-or for people who despise them just for the job they do?\n\nThat's why I'm proud to stand with Concerned Communities for America, a nonprofit established by Black clergy, community, and business leaders to fight for public safety and prosperity in urban areas harmed by decades of crime and neglect. We are demanding that the CEOs of these woke corporations acknowledge and apologize for what they've done, and pledge their support for our men and women in blue and the families of fallen officers.\n\nThere are better ways for companies to virtue signal. We should not be promoting violence against anyone. We should be working to heal our divisions, not inflame them. Everyone has a role to play, including the leaders of wealthy, influential corporations.\n\nDominique Luzuriaga Rivera is the widow of fallen NYPD Detective Jason Rivera.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the writer's own.\n\nNewsletters in your inbox See all\n\nCompany\n\nEditions:\n\nContact\n\nTerms of Use\n\n© 2025 NEWSWEEK DIGITAL LLC"

      "text": "Maryland Cop Who Recklessly Shot a 5-Year-Old Boy Got Qualified Immunity\n\nQualified Immunity\n\nJacob Sullum | 1.13.2025 4:40 PM\n\nDuring an August 2016 standoff with an armed woman at an apartment in Baltimore County, Maryland, a police officer fired his rifle through an interior wall into the kitchen. The bullet struck the woman, Korryn Gaines, in the upper back, then ricocheted off the refrigerator, striking her 5-year-old son, Kodi, in the cheek.\n\nThe officer, Baltimore County Cpl. Royce Ruby, later testified that he fired the \"head shot\" without a clear view of Gaines, saying he could see only her braids and the barrel of the shotgun through his rifle scope. He also said he could not see Kodi but knew that he was in the kitchen and that \"there's a possibility\" the boy would be hit by the bullet. A witness testified that Gaines, explaining his decision to take the shot, described himself as \"hot\" and \"frustrated.\"\n\nIt was understandable that Ruby was hot. The police had cut off power to the apartment building, which was sweltering without air conditioning. It was also understandable that he was frustrated. At that point, the standoff, during which more than 30 officers surrounded the building, had dragged on for more than six hours. Police had been told that Gaines \"had a history of mental illness and that she had been off her medication,\" as the Maryland Supreme Court later noted . \"Officers testified that Ms. Gaines acted erratically, sometimes negotiating with officers, at other times threatening them and cutting off contact.\"\n\nIt is harder to fathom why Ruby decided to fire his rifle even though he recognized that he was endangering a little boy and even though he was not facing an \"imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury.\" The Maryland Supreme Court accepted that Gaines \"may have raised her shotgun\" but \"was not aiming it directly toward officers.\" It nevertheless ruled that Ruby was entitled to qualified immunity, which shields police officers from federal civil rights claims unless their alleged misconduct violated \"clearly established\" rights.\n\nBased on that conclusion, the court overturned $32 million in damages that a jury had awarded Kodi. The boy's father, Corey Cunningham, is now asking the U.S. Supreme Court to review the Maryland Supreme Court's decision. \"Obviously unlawful conduct alone clearly establishes the law such that qualified immunity does not apply,\" his petition argues, citing Supreme Court precedents to that effect. \"Conduct that is so egregious and obviously unlawful as to shock the conscience necessarily forecloses qualified immunity.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court, the Cato Institute notes in a brief supporting Cunningham's petition, \"has held that some rights violations are sufficiently obvious to violate clearly established law even without factually similar precedent.\" It urges the justices to clarify that a court should not grant qualified immunity to \"a police officer who committed a conscience-shocking rights violation simply because it could find no prior decision involving nearly identical facts.\" In this case, Cato says, \"it is self-evident that the officer's conscience-shocking conduct violated the right of Kodi, an innocent bystander, to be free from arbitrary state action.\"\n\nThe deadly encounter with Gaines began after she failed to appear in court for alleged traffic violations. Trying to serve a warrant for her arrest, two Baltimore County police officers knocked on the door of her apartment and announced themselves. Getting no response, they kicked in the door and saw Gaines sitting on the floor with a shotgun in her lap. She remained armed but contained throughout the standoff.\n\nBefore he fired his rifle, Ruby claimed, he saw Gaines \"raise her shotgun into a firing position and aim toward the hinge side of the front door, from which she could have hit officers stationed on the other side.\" But that account, the Maryland Supreme Court noted, was inconsistent with Ruby's testimony that \"all he could see through his scope were Ms. Gaines's braids and the barrel of the gun.\" Other witnesses \"testified that more of her body would have been visible had she been aiming the gun as Corporal Ruby contended.\"\n\nAfter Ruby fired his rifle, thereby injuring Kodi as well as his mother, he entered the apartment. Hearing \"the shotgun go off and being reloaded,\" he shot Gaines three more times, killing her. One of his rounds again struck Kodi, who this time was hit in his elbow. Kodi \"underwent multiple surgeries to remove bullet fragments from his face\" and \"required multiple reconstructive surgeries on his elbow.\"\n\nWhen Ruby first opened fire, Cato's brief notes, he did so \"without any imminent threat to life or limb.\" Because \"he was 'hot and frustrated,'\" he \"fired his rifle through the wall of a kitchen where he knew a five-year-old child...was present but not visible.\" Ruby \"admitted to knowing that his first shot could hit Kodi.\"\n\nDespite those facts, the Maryland Supreme Court concluded \"it was not clearly established that Corporal Ruby would violate Kodi's right to substantive due process under the Fourteenth Amendment\" by firing his rifle in these circumstances. The court conceded that \"'clearly established' does not mean that there must be a case with precisely matching facts or that found a violation in the same specific context.\" But its subsequent analysis seemed to require just that.\n\n\"Although it is 'possible' that sufficiently 'reckless and irresponsible' actions like 'shooting into a crowd at close range' could rise to the level of a Fourteenth Amendment violation,\" the court said, \"the parties have cited no case decided by the time of the shooting here that had reached such a conclusion....At the time of the shooting, no decision from any appellate court in the country-much less a controlling decision or 'a robust consensus of persuasive authority,' had held that an officer who took action similar to that of Corporal Ruby violated the Fourteenth Amendment.\"\n\nDissenting Justice Michele Hotten saw things differently. \"This case is a catastrophic example of poor decision-making and the overzealous exercise of state-sanctioned force,\" she wrote . \"The decision by an officer to shoot through a wall, at a target he could not see, when he knew a child was on the other side of that wall and could be injured or killed, is patently offensive to a 'universal sense of justice.'...As made clear by the facts, the shooting of Ms. Gaines and the injury to Kodi were unnecessary, avoidable, and legally unjustifiable. At best, this decision joins an ever-increasing line of cases in which few, if any, abusive exercises of state power are deemed violative of a person's Substantive Due Process rights. At worst, this case serves to justify future shootings by police, taken in frustration and in disregard to the risk posed to known bystanders.\"\n\nThe majority's position on qualified immunity illustrates a baffling situation that 5th Circuit Judge Don Willett has decried . \"To some observers,\" he wrote in a 2019 case, \"qualified immunity smacks of unqualified impunity, letting public officials duck consequences for bad behavior-no matter how palpably unreasonable-as long as they were the first to behave badly.\"\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch noted the same danger as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit. \"Some things are so obviously unlawful that they don't require detailed explanation,\" Gorsuch wrote in a 2015 case, \"and sometimes the most obviously unlawful things happen so rarely that a case on point is itself an unusual thing. Indeed, it would be remarkable if the most obviously unconstitutional conduct should be the most immune from liability only because it is so flagrantly unlawful that few dare its attempt.\"\n\nBased on similar concerns, the Supreme Court has said that alleging a violation of \"clearly established\" law does not necessarily require locating a precedent with closely similar facts. The issue, it explained in the 2002 case Hope v. Pelzer , is not whether the \"very action in question has previously been held unlawful\" but whether officials had \"fair warning that their alleged [misconduct] was unconstitutional.\" In Hope , the Court deemed it \"obvious\" that handcuffing a shirtless prisoner to a hitching post for seven hours in the hot sun violated the Eighth Amendment's ban on \"cruel and unusual\" punishment.\n\nThe Court reiterated that qualified immunity does not apply to \"obvious\" constitutional violations in the 2020 case Taylor v. Riojas , which involved a Texas prisoner who was confined in \"a pair of shockingly unsanitary cells.\" One \"was covered, nearly floor to ceiling, in 'massive amounts' of feces\"; the other was \"frigidly cold\" and \"equipped with only a clogged drain in the floor to dispose of bodily wastes.\"\n\nAlthough Hope and Taylor \"both involved Eighth Amendment claims, their holdings are general,\" Cato notes. Yet \"persistent confusion about the obviousness exception in qualified immunity doctrine has engendered analytical inconsistency and avoidable injustices, like the one that occurred in this case.\"\n\nThe Maryland Supreme Court's \"erroneous approach-granting qualified immunity simply because there is no case exactly on point, no matter how manifestly unlawful the rights violation-is regrettably common in the lower courts,\" Cato says. It cites cases where cops or jailers received qualified immunity after shooting a 10-year-old boy in the leg \"while attempting to shoot an unthreatening family dog\"; after stealing $225,000 in cash and rare coins while executing a search warrant; and after putting a prisoner in solitary confinement for five months \"because he asked why he could not visit the commissary.\" To prevent such outrageous outcomes, Cato says, the Supreme Court \"should reaffirm that Hope and Taylor apply to any case involving obvious rights violations.\"\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Cop Who Fired Blindly Into Breonna Taylor's Home Is Convicted of Violating Her Constitutional Rights\n\nBreonna Taylor\n\nJacob Sullum | 11.4.2024 2:45 PM\n\nLouisville, Kentucky, police did a lot of questionable things before, during, and after the March 2020 drug raid that killed Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old EMT and aspiring nurse. Their lapses included a misleading, legally deficient search warrant affidavit ; a reckless, middle-of-the-night home invasion that led to a lethal confrontation; and a conspiracy to cover up the misrepresentations that preceded the raid. But the most baffling aspect of the incident was Detective Brett Hankison's decision to blindly fire 10 rounds from outside Taylor's apartment through a bedroom window and a sliding glass door that were covered by blinds and curtains.\n\nOn Friday, after deliberating for more than 20 hours over three days, a federal jury in Louisville convicted Hankison of willfully violating Taylor's Fourth Amendment rights under color of law by firing five rounds through the bedroom window. Although none of the bullets struck Taylor, federal prosecutors argued that Hankison endangered her life by unlawfully using deadly force.\n\nBecause the charge \"involved the use of a dangerous weapon and an attempt to kill,\" Hankison faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. The jury acquitted him of a second count under the same statute, which alleged that he violated the constitutional rights of Taylor's neighbors, who were endangered by bullets that penetrated their apartment.\n\nHankison, who was fired from his job with the Louisville Metro Police Department in June 2020, is the only officer directly involved in the raid to be convicted of a crime. In March 2022, a state jury acquitted him of wanton endangerment, a charge based on the same use of force. Hankison was indicted on federal civil rights charges five months later. Last year, his first prosecution on those charges ended with a mistrial after jurors failed to reach a verdict.\n\nDuring his second federal trial, Hankison again testified that he was trying to help two fellow officers inside Taylor's apartment, Sgt. Jonathan Mattingly and Detective Myles Cosgrove, thinking they were under sustained fire. Here is what was actually happening, as described in a Justice Department press release about Hankison's conviction:\n\nDuring the execution of the warrant at Taylor's home, officers knocked on Taylor's door and announced themselves as police at approximately 12:45 a.m. No one answered the door, and the officers saw no indication that anyone in the home was awake or had heard their announcement. The police then rammed the door open and Taylor's boyfriend, believing that intruders were breaking in, fired his handgun one time at officers, two of whom fired back, hitting and killing Taylor.\n\nTaylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, has consistently said he heard no announcement and had no idea the intruders who had broken into the apartment were police officers. He was initially charged with attempted murder of a police officer, but prosecutors dropped that charge two months later, implicitly conceding that Walker had a strong self-defense claim. The bullet he fired struck Mattingly in the leg. In response, Mattingly and Cosgrove fired a total of 22 rounds down a dark hallway, where Taylor, who was unarmed, was standing near Walker.\n\nHankison, who could not see what was happening because he had moved from the doorway to the side of the apartment, testified that he mistook his colleagues' hail of bullets for gunfire from a semi-automatic rifle. \"I saw those windows and doors lighting up,\" he said . \"It looked like there was a strobe light in there....In my mind, an AR-15 is being shot, and it sounds like it's getting closer and louder.\" He added that it \"sounded like a semiautomatic rifle making its way down the hallway and executing everybody.\"\n\nEven so, Hankison's response is hard to fathom, since he had no way of knowing who might be hit by his rounds. The Associated Press notes that \"several witnesses, including Louisville's police chief,\" testified that Hankison \"violated Louisville police policy that requires officers to identify a target before firing.\"\n\nDefense attorney Don Malarcik nevertheless insisted that Hankison had done nothing wrong. \"He did exactly what he was supposed to do,\" Malarcik told the jurors during his closing argument. \"He was acting to save lives.\"\n\nNot so, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Songer. Hankison \"violated one of the most fundamental rules of deadly force,\" Songer told the jury. \"If they cannot see the person they're shooting at, they cannot pull the trigger.\"\n\nAccording to Yvette Gentry, Louisville's former interim police chief, Cosgrove-who fired 16 rounds into the apartment, including the one that killed Taylor-did something similar. Gentry canned Cosgrove in December 2020, saying he had fired \"in three distinctly different directions,\" which indicated he \"did not identify a target\" and instead \"fired in a manner consistent with suppressive fire, which is in direct contradiction to our training, values and policy.\"\n\nLike Hankison, Cosgrove said he mistook police gunfire (Mattingly's) for incoming rounds. He told investigators he was \"overwhelmed with bright flashes and darkness,\" which led him to believe \"there's still these gunshots happening due to those bright lights.\" Cosgrove, who later found work as a sheriff's deputy in Carroll County, Kentucky, suggested that he fired his gun without thinking. \"I just sensed that I've fired,\" he said. \"It's like a surreal thing. If you told me I didn't do something at that time, I'd believe you. If you told me I did do something, I'd probably believe you, too.\"\n\nAn investigation by Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron nevertheless concluded that both Cosgrove and Mattingly had fired in self-defense, meaning that criminal charges were not justified. The fact that Walker also seems to have fired in self-defense underlines the recklessness of the \"dynamic entry\" tactics that police reflexively used in this case.\n\nTaylor's death inspired extensive local protests and became a leading exhibit for the Black Lives Matter movement, along with George Floyd's death in Minneapolis two months later. In September 2020, the city of Louisville agreed to a $12 million settlement of a lawsuit filed by Taylor's family. But except for Hankison's unsuccessful prosecution, the raid did not result in any state charges.\n\nThe Justice Department, by contrast, obtained indictments against Hankison and three other current or former Louisville officers connected to the raid: former Detective Joshua Jaynes, who filed the search warrant affidavit; Sgt. Kyle Meany, who signed off on it; and Detective Kelly Goodlett, who allegedly \"conspir[ed] with Jaynes to falsify the search warrant for Taylor's home and to cover up their actions afterward.\"\n\nJaynes' affidavit , which linked Taylor to a former boyfriend's drug dealing based on little more than guilt by association, \"contained false and misleading statements, omitted material facts, relied on stale information, and was not supported by probable cause,\" the Justice Department says . Jaynes, like Hankison, is charged with willfully violating Taylor's Fourth Amendment rights. The former detective, who was fired in December 2020 for lying in his affidavit, is also charged with falsifying records in a federal investigation and with conspiracy for \"agreeing with another detective to cover up the false warrant affidavit after Taylor's death by drafting a false investigative letter and making false statements to criminal investigators.\"\n\nMeany faces the same civil rights charge. He is also charged with making a false statement to federal investigators by claiming that police sought a no-knock search warrant for Taylor's apartment because the police department's SWAT unit had requested it.\n\nGoodlett, the detective who allegedly conspired with Jaynes, pleaded guilty in August 2022, a few weeks after her indictment. Jaynes and Meany have not been tried yet.

The incident, which occurred in October, gave the elderly man severe injuries, including a broken neck, a broken eye socket, and a brain bleed.\n\nOn October 27, Officer Joseph Gibson responded to a minor accident involving 71-year-old Lich Vu. In body camera footage of the incident, the pair began arguing after Gibson told Vu that he was going to \"have to write you a ticket for improper U-turn.\"\n\n\"I didn't U-turn,\" Vu replied.\n\nWhen Gibson directed Vu to sign a document agreeing to \"take care\" of the citation, Vu appeared confused and refused to sign.\n\n\"We are not arguing about this, OK?\" said Gibson. \"We argue in court....If you don't sign this, you go to jail, OK? I don't want to take you to jail.\"\n\nVu continued to dispute the ticket. Eventually, video shows him growing frustrated, lightly slapping Gibson's chest, and saying \"Shut up.\" Immediately, Gibson grabbed Vu's wrists and slammed him to the ground. Video shows Vu's face striking the pavement and the elderly man lying motionless as Gibson handcuffs him.\n\nThe Associated Press reports that Vu was taken to a local hospital , where he is still receiving treatment.\n\nOn Thursday, Gibson was charged with one count of aggravated assault and battery. \"The Oklahoma County District Attorney's Office takes all use-of-force incidents very seriously,\" District Attorney Vicki Behenna commented in a statement . \"We evaluate the law and the facts in each individual case, and in this particular case determined the Officer's actions were an unreasonable use-of-force.\n\nThe Oklahoma City Fraternal Order of Police is backing Gibson, stating that the officer \" handled this call for service with professionalism.\" The group added: \"It is very disappointing to see a police officer face felony charges for actions taken in good faith while serving in the line of duty.

      "text": "Supreme Court Won't Hear a Qualified Immunity Case Where a Cop Disclosed an Abuse Report to a Woman's Abuser\n\nPolice Abuse\n\nC.J. Ciaramella | 11.14.2024 2:00 PM\n\nA California woman won't be allowed to sue the police officer who allegedly leaked a confidential abuse report to her violent boyfriend after the Supreme Court declined to review her case, ending her nearly decade-long legal battle to hold police officers responsible for abetting her abuse.\n\nThe Supreme Court declined this week to take up a petition for writ of certiorar i filed in August by Desiree Martinez. Martinez filed a federal civil rights lawsuit in 2015 against several police officers in Clovis, California, who she accused of ignoring multiple attempts to report her abusive boyfriend. She says that's because her boyfriend, Kyle Pennington, was also a Clovis police officer.\n\nBut the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled that those officers, including one who tipped off her boyfriend, are immune from Martinez's lawsuit under qualified immunity-a legal doctrine that shields state and local government officials from federal civil suits if their alleged misconduct was not \"clearly established\" by existing case law.\n\nQualified immunity allows government officials to avoid liability even in cases where courts find that they violated the plaintiffs' constitutional rights. Defenders of qualified immunity say it protects police from frivolous lawsuits, but in practice it also short-circuits credible allegations of civil rights violations before they ever reach a jury.\n\nMartinez was represented by the Institute for Justice, a libertarian-leaning public interest law firm.\n\n\"This is obviously hugely disappointing,\" Anya Bidwell, an Institute for Justice senior attorney, said in a press release. \"Qualified immunity should not be a one-size-fits-all doctrine that protects on-the-beat cops and desk-bound bureaucrats alike. My heart breaks for Desiree. But one day, when we defeat qualified immunity, it will be because she and other heroes like her had the courage to stand up.\"\n\nAccording to Martinez's Supreme Court petition, in one instance she filed a confidential abuse report against Pennington to the Clovis police. Later, during a late-night argument, Pennington called another Clovis officer, Channon High. Pennington put her on speakerphone and asked Martinez, \"So you're telling the cops what I did to you?\"\n\nMartinez denied it, but High interjected, \"Yes, she did. I see a report right here.\"\n\nMartinez claims Pennington hung up the phone and sexually and physically abused her. Pennington was later convicted of violating a restraining order, and prosecutors dropped more serious charges against him in exchange for a guilty plea to a single misdemeanor domestic abuse charge.\n\nMartinez's 2015 lawsuit alleged High violated her substantive due process rights under the 14th Amendment by disclosing her confidential report to Pennington.\n\nThe long legal saga that followed shows how qualified immunity shuts the courthouse door on alleged victims of government abuse before their claims can ever be judged on the merits.\n\nA U.S. district court initially ruled that High wasn't entitled to qualified immunity from Martinez's suit, writing that \"it was clearly established that an officer sharing a domestic violence victim's confidential information to the alleged abuser would be a violation of the victim's substantive due process rights.\"\n\nHigh appealed to the 9th Circuit, which likewise concluded that \"Officer High violated Ms. Martinez's due process rights by knowingly placing her in greater danger of Mr. Pennington's assaults.\" (When considering a motion to dismiss a civil lawsuit, courts are obligated to assume the plaintiff's factual allegations are true.)\n\nFrom that sentence, a reader might assume that the 9th Circuit likewise found that High wasn't entitled to qualified immunity-but not so!\n\nAlthough the 9th Circuit previously ruled in 2006 that police officers violated due process by disclosing complaints to their subjects, it decided that the facts of that case were not sufficiently similar to Martinez's. Therefore Martinez's right to file a domestic abuse complaint without having it disclosed to her abuser was not clearly established, and High couldn't have had fair notice that her conduct violated Martinez's rights.\n\nWhether or not an alleged victim of government abuse can sue the officials responsible often depends on whether they can find a case with a nearly identical background. The practical effect of this is that qualified immunity drags out lawsuits by years and permits constitutional violations as long as they are novel.\n\nWhile the Supreme Court has overturned some individual qualified immunity cases that were particularly outrageous -like one where correctional officers locked a psychiatric inmate in a cell filled with feces and raw sewage-it has continually declined to reconsider the doctrine as a whole.\n\nUntil it does, or until Congress gets its act together, plaintiffs like Martinez will have no recourse.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "A State Cop Lionized for Nabbing Drunk Drivers Is Suspected of Taking Bribes To Let Them Off the Hook\n\nPolice Abuse\n\nJacob Sullum | 2.19.2025 3:05 PM\n\n\"Thank you for helping ENDWI,\" says a poster that the New Mexico Department of Transportation produced as part of its long-running campaign against drunk driving. The poster features a photograph of New Mexico State Police (NMSP) Sgt. Toby LaFave, an award-winning, record-setting officer who was \"the face of DWI enforcement\" for the NMSP, appearing in anti-DWI billboards and videos because he was celebrated for his dogged efforts to protect public safety by nabbing intoxicated drivers.\n\nLast Friday, NMSP Chief Troy Weisler revealed that LaFave had been placed on paid leave pending the outcome of an internal investigation triggered by a huge corruption scandal involving cops who took bribes in exchange for making DWI cases disappear. According to federal prosecutors and Thomas Clear, the Albuquerque defense attorney at the center of the scandal, the corruption goes back decades and involved \"many officers.\" While most of the crooked cops served in the Albuquerque Police Department (APD) unit charged with apprehending drunk drivers, where corruption was pervasive, Clear says he also bribed employees of the NMSP and the Bernalillo County Sheriff's Office.\n\nLaFave's alleged participation in what prosecutors call the \"DWI Enterprise\" underlines the question of how the conspiracy, which was uncovered by an FBI investigation that became public in January 2024, went undetected for so long. For at least two dozen years, Clear says, he routinely paid cops to help his clients avoid prosecution and keep their driver's licenses. His collaborators did that either by refraining from filing DWI charges or by deliberately missing pretrial interviews, hearings, or trials, allowing Clear to move for dismissal.\n\nThat arrangement endangered public safety by letting drunk drivers off the hook. It also gave cops a financial incentive to arrest innocent drivers on bogus DWI charges and refer them to Clear, who typically collected cash fees ranging from $6,000 to $10,000 and gave the arresting officer a cut. Meanwhile, those cops not only avoided exposure as criminals; they were lionized as dedicated public servants who were making the roads safer.\n\nWhen he pleaded guilty to federal bribery, extortion, and racketeering charges last week, Clear said he had been bribing cops, including \"almost the entire APD DWI unit,\" since \"at least the late 1990s.\" The APD officers who took payoffs included Honorio Alba Jr., who pleaded guilty to similar charges on February 7. As late as last December, the APD was still bragging that Alba had been selected as \"Officer of the Year\" by the New Mexico chapter of Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD). But Alba's celebrity paled beside LaFave's.\n\nLaFave, who joined the state police in 2012, received that MADD honor twice and was named \"State Police Officer of the Year\" in 2012. The \"DWI King\" bragged that he had arrested more drunk drivers than any other officer in the NMSP's history, and his work repeatedly attracted laudatory news coverage.\n\nIn September 2017, KRQE, the CBS affiliate in Albuquerque, reported that LaFave had \"reached a milestone when it comes to putting drunk drivers behind bars\" by making \"his 100th DWI arrest.\" The station noted that \"you might recognize him from the ENDWI billboards\" that presented him as the epitome of the state's anti-DWI efforts. Pete Kassetas, then the NMSP chief, said \"LaFave should be applauded for his commitment to keeping the roads safe from drunk drivers.\"\n\nLaFave was back in the news the following month, when KRQE reported , under the headline \"State Police Officer Moved to Tears After DWI Stop,\" that he had \"spotted a driver in a gold Cadilac going 96 mph down Interstate 40, weaving through traffic.\" When LaFave pulled the car over, \"he immediately noticed a little girl unbuckled in the front seat and asked the driver what she was thinking driving like that.\" After the driver failed \"multiple\" roadside sobriety tests, LaFave arrested her for DWI, but he could not get over the endangered child. He \"got choked up\" while \"speaking with someone on the phone about picking up the little girl.\" Walking back to his patrol car, he told a fellow officer, \"That makes my heart hurt.\" It was \"a normal night for State Police Officer Toby Lafave,\" KRQE said.\n\nThe station's praise continued. \"You've seen him in the DWI ads and you've seen him out on the streets,\" a November 2018 story began. \"But in person, State Police Officer Toby Lafave will tell you, he does this job for people like you and me.\" The station noted that LaFave had already made 130 DWI arrests that year, nabbing \"more drunk drivers than any other cop.\" Here is how he described his motivation: \"It's very disheartening knowing that people continue to drink and drive, seeing all the commercials, seeing all the ads, seeing all the fatals, children in vehicles, and they still continue to do it....I believe that DWI is a very serious thing.\" For LaFave, KRQE said, \"it's a never-ending job-one that drives him to save lives.\"\n\nLast June, six months after news of the FBI corruption investigation broke, KRQE highlighted LaFave's arrest of an intoxicated APD officer who was speeding to work in his SUV when LaFave pulled him over. The station noted that LaFave \"is well known in the state for his career putting drunk drivers behind bars.\"\n\nKRQE is not celebrating LaFave anymore. \"Since Lafave was put on leave,\" it reported last Friday, \"the Bernalillo County District Attorney has added him to the Giglio List, meaning he is not considered a credible witness in court. To date, the DA has dropped 230 cases involving officers implicated in the DWI enterprise. A spokesperson for the DA said they are currently reviewing Lafave's cases to see what may need to be dropped.\"\n\nLaFave \"filed at least 1,300 felony and misdemeanor DWI cases from 2009 to this month,\" the Albuquerque Journal reports . \"Of the 31 DWI cases where LaFave was the arresting officer and Clear was the defense attorney, 17, or 57%, were dismissed.\"\n\nLike KRQE, Chief Weisler seems to be having second thoughts about LaFave's performance. \"Any misconduct or criminal behavior within our ranks will not be tolerated,\" he said in a press release. \"The New Mexico State Police holds its officers to the highest ethical and professional standards. If it is found Sergeant Lafave's actions have violated the law or our policies, he will be dealt with swiftly and decisively. I also want to assure the public that our internal investigation is a top priority. I will do everything in my power to ensure any State Police officer who engaged in corrupt behavior is prosecuted to the full extent of the law. We will not allow the actions of any individual to tarnish the reputation and sacrifice of the men and women in this department who uphold their oath with pride and honor every day.\"\n\nWeisler's stance is refreshing compared to Bernalillo County Sheriff John Allen's attitude. In a recent interview with KRQE, Allen sounded more upset about the FBI's investigation than he was about the corruption it uncovered. Although he placed Deputy Jeff Hammerel on administrative leave after learning that he was a target of that probe, Allen said he was not conducting an internal investigation and did not plan to do so.\n\n\"I know that there's nothing to worry about right now,\" Allen said. \"It's an investigation. I was not naive to the fact that this could possibly pop up. If it's happening at Albuquerque Police Department, and we all work so closely together, this could affect my agency.\" When KRQE asked \"if he believed that Hammerel was the only [deputy] who was involved in the DWI scheme,\" Allen replied, \"I don't believe anything at this point.\"\n\nAlbuquerque Police Chief Harold Medina, for his part, has repeatedly promised to \"make sure that we get to the bottom of this.\" But by his account, Medina, who joined the APD in 1995 and has run or helped run the department since 2017, had no idea what was going on in the DWI unit until he was briefed on the FBI investigation in October 2023. He was so oblivious, in fact, that he put former DWI officers in charge of the APD's internal affairs division, where they were well-positioned to protect Clear's racket.\n\nGiven the pervasiveness of corruption in the APD's DWI unit, the turnover of cops assigned to it, and the length of time that the \"DWI Enterprise\" operated, it probably involved dozens of officers. According to a lawsuit by drivers arrested for DWI, Medina \"ratified the conduct\" of those corrupt officers by \"failing to intervene after receiving multiple notices\" that they were \"violating the law.\" In December 2022, for example, the APD got a tip that DWI officers, including Alba, were getting paid to make sure that cases were dismissed. The investigation of that tip went nowhere.\n\nThat was not Medina's only chance to clean his own house instead of waiting for the FBI to discover the mess. \"Systems that struggle, systems that have loopholes, are really open to corruption,\" he said a year ago, alluding to DWI dismissals prompted by officers' failure to show up at crucial proceedings. He made it sound as if he had nothing to do with the \"systems\" that are \"really open to corruption.\" But the lawsuit notes that the APD failed to keep track of DWI officers' appearances, let alone ask why they were conveniently absent so often in cases involving Clear's clients.\n\nThe connivance of senior APD officers who had participated in the \"DWI Enterprise\" and did their best to protect it helps explain why it lasted so long. But that explanation goes only so far.\n\nThe FBI received multiple reports from people who said APD officers had referred them to Clear after arresting them, recommending him as a lawyer who could get their charges dismissed. As an added incentive to hire Clear, the cops often retained the arrestees' licenses or other personal effects and handed them over to Clear's investigator, Ricardo Mendez, who admitted his role in the scheme when he pleaded guilty last month.\n\nThis thinly veiled extortion affected many people, and it persisted for more than two decades. It is hard to believe such manifestly suspicious conduct never came to the attention of local authorities with the power to do something about it. Such systematic corruption would have been possible only if local officials who were not directly involved in it looked the other way.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "SCOTUS Revives Lawsuit Against Missouri Cop Who Jailed a Man 'for Being an Asshole'\n\nPolice Abuse\n\nJacob Sullum | 10.11.2024 5:20 PM\n\nOn a Saturday night in May 2021, Mason Murphy was walking on the shoulder of a rural road in Sunrise Beach, a small Missouri town, when he was accosted by a local police officer, Michael Schmitt, who asked him to identify himself. Since Murphy was minding his own business and was not, as far as he knew, doing anything illegal, he did not think he should have to comply with that request. Murphy's objection resulted in a nine-minute argument with Schmitt, who ultimately handcuffed Murphy and took him to jail, where he was detained for two hours.\n\nWhy? Schmitt had trouble answering that question. \"I didn't want him walking down my highway,\" he told another officer at the jail. Schmitt also suggested that Murphy was being held \"for being an asshole\" and that he would stay in jail \"until he decides to play nice.\" Even after consulting with a senior officer and a local prosecutor, Schmitt could not come up with a valid reason to arrest Murphy, who was released without being charged.\n\nFive months later, Murphy sued Schmitt for violating his First Amendment rights by arresting him in retaliation for constitutionally protected speech. A federal judge dismissed Murphy's claim, and last year the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit upheld that decision. But this week the U.S. Supreme Court revived Murphy's lawsuit, remanding the case for further consideration in light of Gonzalez v. Trevino , a June 2024 decision that made it easier for victims of retaliatory arrests to make a case for compensation.\n\n\"This decision is a huge step forward, not just for Mason Murphy, but for all Americans who have been retaliated against by government officials for their speech,\" said Marie Miller, an attorney at the Institute for Justice, which filed Murphy's Supreme Court petition. \"Our work is building lasting precedent, making it easier for people to hold officials accountable when their rights are violated. We will continue fighting until all Americans are protected against government retaliation.\"\n\nAlthough Schmitt evidently did not realize it at the time, Murphy had broken the law: He had violated Section 300.405.2 of Missouri's statutes, which says: \"Where sidewalks are not provided any pedestrian walking along and upon a highway shall when practicable walk only on the left side of the roadway or its shoulder facing traffic which may approach from the opposite direction.\" Murphy was walking on the right side of the road when Schmitt approached him-a fact to which the officer alluded during the initial encounter, most of which was recorded by Schmitt's body camera.\n\n\"Have I committed a crime?\" Murphy asked. \"You're walking down my highway in the dark,\" Schmitt replied. \"You're walking on the wrong side of the road. You're about to get hit. I have a feeling you're drinking.\" In a radio call, Schmitt likewise described Murphy as an \"intoxicated subject\" who was \"refusing to identify.\" Because \"I have a feeling that you are drinking,\" Schmitt told Murphy, \"I wanna make sure you're safe.\"\n\nMurphy, who was 20 at the time, said he did not drink. Contrary to Schmitt's repeated claims, Murphy was completely sober, and there is nothing inherently illegal about walking along a highway in the dark. \"Walking on the wrong side of the road,\" by contrast, is illegal in Missouri. But it seems clear Schmitt did not know that, because otherwise he would not have struggled to come up with a charge he could file against Murphy after arresting him. Schmitt's apparent ignorance of the law reinforces Murphy's argument that his real offense was challenging a cop's authority.\n\nSchmitt's comments before and after the arrest reinforce that impression. \"I'm not trying to charge you,\" he told Murphy. \"I'm just trying to figure out who you are.\" But if Murphy persisted in refusing to give Schmitt his name, the officer said, \"I'll take you on down to jail and run your fingerprints. We can do it the hard way or the easy way.\"\n\nMurphy, who was dismayed and frustrated but remained calm, thought that threat was legally unjustified. \"I haven't done a thing wrong,\" he said. \"I don't know why police think they can do this.\" Schmitt's response: \"Because we can.\"\n\nMurphy did not think that explanation was adequate. \"I'm gonna take you to jail,\" Schmitt warned. \"You're the one making it hard on yourself.\"\n\nWhen Murphy said \"that's not lawful,\" Schmitt insisted that it was, because \"you are walking down the highway in the dark.\" Murphy was unpersuaded, saying Schmitt had the authority to demand identification only \"if I have committed a crime or if you suspect me to have committed a crime.\" Schmitt said he was \"tired of arguing with you.\"\n\nThis continued for a while. Schmitt kept insisting that Murphy was drunk, which Murphy kept (accurately) denying. Schmitt kept insisting that Murphy was legally obligated to give his name, an assertion that Murphy continued to question.\n\n\"I don't appreciate you giving me grief,\" Schmitt said. \"I'm just trying to do my job.\" Murphy disagreed: \"I'm not giving you grief. You're giving me grief.\"\n\nEventually, Schmitt delivered on his threat. But even as he was handcuffing Murphy, he still had not answered the question that Murphy had repeatedly asked: \"What crime have I committed?\"\n\nAfter the arrest, the argument became more heated. \"You both are fucking idiots,\" Murphy told Schmitt and a Laurie, Missouri, officer who had responded to his request for assistance. \"Dumb as shit.\" Schmitt told him to \"shut the fuck up.\"\n\nSchmitt was still trying to figure out exactly why he was arresting Murphy. \"What's my charges?\" he asked the other officer. \"Refusal to identify?\" Maybe, the other cop said, assuming Schmitt could \"articulate that you had a reason to deal with him.\" Or the charge \"could be disobeying a lawful order,\" he suggested. \"You can figure it out.\" But Schmitt never did.\n\nDuring the ride to the county jail, Murphy's Supreme Court petition notes, he \"continued to orally contest the lawfulness of Schmitt's actions. He called Schmitt names and criticized and insulted him, including for not wearing a seat belt. But Murphy was not violent. Schmitt argued with Murphy and called him degrading names, too. In short, both men were rude and abrasive in their comments to each other.\"\n\nAfter 25 minutes, Schmitt and Murphy arrived at the county jail. Schmitt called Scott Craig, a senior officer who is now Sunrise Beach's police chief, and explained that Murphy had been walking along the highway and was \"refusing to identify himself.\" He asked what he could charge Murphy with. \"I don't know,\" Craig replied, suggesting that Schmitt consult the on-call prosecutor, because unless Murphy was drunk \"there's really not anything\" and \"that's gonna be a tricky one.\"\n\nAfter that conversation, the petition says, Craig \"took Murphy into a room at the jail, where they joined at least three other officers, including the jail supervisor, Officer Jerry Pedigo. Murphy again asked what crime he had committed. The officers did not tell him. Murphy argued with the officers about Schmitt's demand that he identify himself and continued to question why he was at the jail. Pedigo told Murphy, 'In here you're not going to run your mouth to me, 'cuz I'll just as soon punch you in the face and put you in that chair.' Murphy asked Pedigo if he would really punch him in the face. Pedigo confirmed, 'Absolutely. If you keep running your mouth to me.'\"\n\nAfter Murphy was locked in a cell, according to the petition, \"Schmitt told Pedigo, 'I'm going to talk to the PA [Prosecuting Attorney], see what I can get on him.' Officers called Murphy more degrading names and learned his name from a credit card in his wallet. Rather than release Murphy upon learning his identity, Schmitt said, 'He can still sit here for being an asshole.'\"\n\nSchmitt \"later made a phone call for a record check on Murphy and said, 'Please let there be a warrant.' When the record came back clean, Schmitt said, 'Damn.' He said that Murphy would be on a 12-hour hold 'until he decides to play nice,' that Murphy 'was just all full of insults and rude things to say all the way down here,' and that 'I didn't want him walking down my highway.'\"\n\nPedigo was later fired for threatening Murphy. After reviewing video of the interactions at the jail, Camden County Sheriff Tony Helms said he was outraged by what he saw. \"It was wrong,\" Helms told a local newspaper the month after the incident. \"I was furious. We strive so hard and all it takes is one person-one person not following policies and procedures, one person threatening to do something like this to make all of us look bad. Just like any profession, there are good cops and there are bad cops. I can't make any excuses for the type of behavior seen in the video. It was unacceptable, and I apologize to the victim and to the people of Camden County.\"\n\nWhether Murphy will get more than that apology depends on what happens now that the Supreme Court has sent his case back to the 8th Circuit. Five years ago in Nieves v. Bartlett , the Court held that an arrest can violate the First Amendment even if it was based on probable cause, provided the claimant can present \"objective evidence that he was arrested when otherwise similarly situated individuals not engaged in the same sort of protected speech had not been.\" Last June in Gonzalez v. Trevino , the Court said that showing does not require \"very specific comparator evidence\" indicating that \"identifiable people\" engaged in similar conduct but were not arrested.\n\nMurphy conceded that Schmitt had probable cause to arrest him for walking on the wrong side of the highway, although Schmitt never filed that charge. But Murphy argued that \"walking on the wrong side of the road occurs all the time on the highways with wide shoulders, and the police rarely, if ever, arrest a person for walking on the wrong side of the road.\" His lawyers said the fact that the police nevertheless arrested Murphy, \"who just ha[d] been protesting police conduct,\" suggested that decision was retaliatory. They added that \"reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery will show that no one else in recent memory has been detained or arrested...in either Sunrise Beach or Camden County for walking on the wrong side of the road.\"\n\nWhat happened to Murphy is strikingly similar to a scenario that Chief Justice John Roberts described in Nieves . \"At many intersections,\" Roberts wrote, \"jaywalking is endemic but rarely results in arrest. If an individual who has been vocally complaining about police conduct is arrested for jaywalking at such an intersection, it would seem insufficiently protective of First Amendment rights to dismiss the individual's retaliatory arrest claim on the ground that there was undoubted probable cause for the arrest.\"\n\nAn 8th Circuit panel nevertheless concluded that Murphy had not supplied sufficient evidence that he was treated differently from other pedestrians who walk on the wrong side of the road. Although \"jaywalking and walking on the wrong side of the road are similar,\" the majority said, \"the present allegations do not show violations of §300.405 are so common as to be 'endemic' or are so frequently observed as to give rise to a 'reasonable inference' that officers 'typically exercise their discretion' not to arrest.\" The majority disregarded Schmitt's recorded statements at the jail, because the Supreme Court \"has been clear\" that \"[ a] particular officer's state of min d is simply 'irrelevant'\" and \"provides 'no basis for invalidating an arrest.'\"\n\nWriting in dissent, Judge L. Steven Grasz said Murphy \"plausibly asserted that the Sunrise Beach Police Department does not regularly enforce this law.\" He noted that \"most, if not all, of the 'objective evidence' about whether Sunrise Beach police officers commonly see people walking on the wrong side of the road, but typically exercise their discretion not to arrest, would not be in Murphy's possession before discovery.\"\n\nUnlike the majority, Grasz thought what happened at the jail was relevant to Murphy's claim. \"If the Sunrise Beach Police Department regularly enforces the Missouri statute prohibiting a person from walking on the wrong side of the road, one would suspect Officer Schmitt and the other officers he spoke with would have had little trouble identifying that law as the basis for the arrest,\" he wrote. \"Instead, viewing the factual allegations in the complaint in a light most favorable to Murphy, Officer Schmitt arrested Murphy for challenging and criticizing him before later exploring various legal justifications for the arrest. Indeed, the allegations of post hoc decision-making indicate pretext, which supports application of the Nieves exception.\"\n\nUnder Gonzalez , Murphy has a shot at proving his claim even if he can't identify specific individuals who were not handcuffed and taken to jail for walking on the wrong side of the road. If discovery is allowed, he should be able to demonstrate that such arrests \"rarely, if ever,\" happen, which would support his argument that he was singled out for punishment because Schmitt did not like his attitude.\n\nMurphy could have avoided arrest if he had simply complied with Schmitt's demand that he identify himself. Instead, he asserted his rights as he understood them, insisting that Schmitt legally justify his inquiry. That clearly annoyed Schmitt, who expected meek compliance instead of an argument. But arguing with a police officer is not a crime, and now Murphy has a chance to vindicate the right to question authority.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

The ACLU of Vermont and the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), which both represented Bombard in his suit, will receive the remaining $75,000.\n\nAll told, Bombard spent \"about a year fighting the criminal charges and more than three years seeking declaratory relief,\" a spokesperson for FIRE tells Reason .\n\nJay Riggen, the officer who arrested Bombard, \"retired from VSP effective May 31, 2024,\" a spokesperson for the Vermont State Police tells Reason . \"We have no additional comment on this case.\"\n\nIn February 2018, Bombard was stopped by Vermont State Trooper Riggen, who believed Bombard had given him the finger while driving-an allegation Bombard denies . However, after Riggen walked away from the car, Bombard flipped Riggen off and swore at the officer in frustration for having been pulled over.\n\nIn response, Riggen pulled Bombard over again and arrested him for disorderly conduct. \"The first one may have been an error,\" said Riggen during the arrest, referring to the reason for the initial stop, but \"the second one certainly was not.\"\n\nBombard's suit claimed that, error or not, the action is constitutionally protected. \"Giving the 'middle finger' and using curse words to protest a police officer's actions constitute expression that is protected by the First Amendment,\" wrote Bombard's counsel in his complaint.\n\n\"The state settled in all likelihood because it was highly likely that a court would rule that Mr. Bombard's First Amendment rights were violated,\" Peter Teachout, a professor at Vermont Law School, says. \"The First Amendment protects not only verbal communications but also 'expressive conduct,'\" which could include gestures.\n\n\"There is, in fact, a significant body of First Amendment and Fourth Amendment case law generated by police retaliating against people who hurt their feelings-most of it firmly upholding the right to hurl choice words or gestures at public officials,\" wrote Reason 's C.J. Ciaramella last year. That includes a 2013 decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit, which sided with a New York man who was arrested for giving a cop the middle finger, and a 2021 decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit, which ruled in favor of a Minnesota man whom a police officer pulled over and arrested because he flipped her the bird.\n\nIn this case, Bombard's gesture expressed a very simple idea: distaste at Riggen for pulling him over. And, whether or not the officer knew it in the moment, expressions of such distaste are generally safeguarded by the First Amendment.\n\n\"Police officers can't (in theory) arrest you for annoying them or even angering them,\" Rebecca Tushnet, a professor at Harvard Law School, tells Reason via email. \"You have the right to be vituperative as long as you are not threatening.\"\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "He Allegedly Killed a Cop During a No-Knock Raid. Will the Jury Agree It Was Self-Defense?\n\nCriminal Justice\n\nBilly Binion | 11.7.2023 5:22 PM\n\nBELTON, TEXAS-A man in small-town Texas is facing life in prison for allegedly killing a police officer. But the trial-which commenced Monday after a nearly decade-long wait-is a confluence of police use of force, the war on drugs, and the right to self-defense. Its outcome will in part answer the following question: How far does a self-defense claim go when it's exercised against the state?\n\nAt around 5:45 a.m. on May 9, 2014, a SWAT team in Killeen, Texas-consisting of about two dozen officers-descended on Marvin Guy's modest apartment on Circle M Drive. They were there to execute a no-knock drug raid, a controversial approach that allows law enforcement to forcibly enter a residence, usually with a fabulous display of force, without first announcing themselves. An informant had reportedly told police that Guy was dealing cocaine.\n\nThe raid did not go as planned.\n\nOfficers smashed Guy's bedroom window and attempted to breach the door with a battering ram. But something appeared to be lodged behind the door, preventing police from immediately gaining entry and leaving them clogged outside the residence. In the rapidly unfolding mayhem, Guy fired several shots outside of his broken window, allegedly hitting four officers. Police quickly fired over 40 rounds in return. One officer, Detective Charles Dinwiddie, died.\n\nGuy was arrested and ultimately charged with one count of capital murder and three counts of attempted capital murder. But he says he believed the police to be intruders when he was awoken and disoriented early that morning. Witnesses for the prosecution yesterday described the neighborhood as one that was known for its high crime rate. Less than a week before the raid, someone broke into Guy's neighbor's residence across the street in similar fashion, forcing entry via a first-floor window and choking a female resident nearly to death.\n\nA series of protracted delays-stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, Guy's declining health, disputes over the district attorney's office releasing all the evidence, and a slew of defense attorneys either quitting or being fired-have lengthened Guy's stay at the county jail, where he has been held for almost a decade on $4 million bond. For years, the state sought the death penalty , which also slowed trial preparations, as proceedings with the ultimate punishment on the table take more time. Prosecutors withdrew that last year, instead opting to pursue life in prison, to speed the process.\n\nThe case is not the first to pit self-defense against no-knock raids. The tactic has come under intense scrutiny in recent years. In 2020, Breonna Taylor was killed by police during a similar raid after her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, grabbed a firearm he legally owned and fired one shot at police, believing them to be intruders. (Police claim they announced themselves before breaking down Walker's door; Walker says he didn't hear them.) Charges against him were ultimately dismissed . In 2021, a Florida man went to trial facing three counts of first-degree attempted murder of a law enforcement officer after he shot at deputies during a 2017 drug raid targeting his father. The government also charged the defendant, Andrew Coffee IV, with murdering his girlfriend, Alteria Woods, who was shot and killed by police, as prosecutors posited that Woods died as a result of Coffee's actions. A jury acquitted him of those charges.\n\nThe topic is particularly relevant in Guy's case, as Texas has the Castle Doctrine, a legal principle grounded in the eponymous idea that someone's home is their castle. As such, they have no duty to retreat when they believe they're facing a deadly threat. An exception: It does not apply when the person in question is engaged in illegal activity. The Killeen Police Department (KPD) allegedly found traces of white powder in Guy's car, on the floor of his apartment, and in the trash, amounting to 1 gram of \"suspected cocaine.\" He was not charged with a drug crime.\n\nBut even if the jury decides Guy is not entitled to protection via the Castle Doctrine, they could still find he acted in self-defense. The state, however, has a radically different theory: At trial yesterday, Bell County Assistant District Attorney Fred Burns laid the groundwork for the notion that the problems cascading from the raid weren't a result of Guy not having enough information. On the contrary-it's because he knew too much, Burns said.\n\nThat theory began to take shape during the testimony of David Daniels, a retired SWAT officer with KPD who was hit by a bullet during the raid. In this telling, Guy had barricaded the door to his apartment not because he was afraid of intruders but because he knew SWAT was coming and plotted to kill the police when they arrived. \"We were ambushed,\" Daniels said. It was not yet clear how the state would prove Guy's clairvoyance about the department's plans.\n\nThe subject of no-knock raids has been a fraught one for KPD. The city recently reached a settlement with the family of a man who was killed during a 2019 raid. In 2021, the local council voted to ban the tactic. Unfortunately, that came too late here.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "The NYPD Took 7 Years To Fire This Cop. Then the Union Hired Him.\n\nPolice\n\nJoe Lancaster | 5.28.2024 3:20 PM\n\nOne of the reasons that it can be so difficult to hold police officers accountable is due to the incredible power wielded by police unions . Even when departments are willing and able to fire bad cops, unions can often get them reinstated, usually at great expense to taxpayers.\n\nAs it turns out, even if it can't save a bad cop's job, the union itself may just hire him.\n\nThe New York Post reported that Hugh Barry, a former sergeant with the New York City Police Department (NYPD), is now employed with the Sergeants Benevolent Association (SBA), the police union that specifically represents NYPD sergeants.\n\nBarry was fired from the NYPD after shooting and killing 66-year-old Deborah Danner in October 2016. Barry was among multiple officers responding to a noise complaint against Danner, a black woman who had struggled with schizophrenia for three decades. According to The New York Times , after Barry persuaded her to put down a pair of scissors she was holding, Danner allegedly \"picked up a baseball bat and tried to swing\" it at him, at which point he shot her twice. (An EMT would later testify that Danner had already put down the scissors by the time Barry arrived, and she only picked up the bat after he tried unsuccessfully to grab her.)\n\nBoth then-Mayor Bill de Blasio and then-Police Commissioner James O'Neill quickly condemned the shooting, with de Blasio calling it \"tragic and unacceptable\" and O'Neill stating, \"We failed.\" They faulted Barry for deploying his firearm instead of a less lethal alternative like a Taser. De Blasio and O'Neill promised a thorough investigation, and Barry was suspended within hours of the shooting.\n\nIn May 2017, Barry was charged with second-degree murder, first- and second-degree manslaughter, and criminally negligent homicide. In February 2018, Barry was acquitted of all charges in a bench trial.\n\nBut while the department moved to fire Barry after the shooting, he would not face any administrative proceedings until January 2022 -after which NYPD officials waited over 18 months before deciding his fate. In September 2023, the department finally forced him out, nearly seven years after he killed Danner.\n\nBarry shot and killed a woman under questionable circumstances, and both the police commissioner and the mayor immediately criticized his conduct. While he would be acquitted by a judge on criminal charges, the city would later pay $2 million to settle a lawsuit brought by Danner's sister, who was present at the shooting.\n\nAnd yet it took nearly seven years for the NYPD to fire Barry, who was placed on \"modified\" duty after the trial, which entails nonenforcement tasks; he earned $152,000 in 2020 alone, as his employer was actively pursuing his termination.\n\nEvery step of the way, the SBA-Barry's union, as an NYPD sergeant-supported him and pushed for his reinstatement. In June 2017, just two weeks after Barry's indictment, the SBA ran a full-page ad in the New York Post and the New York Daily News , in which SBA President Ed Mullins charged that Barry was \"being used as a pawn in political gamesmanship.\" In the following years, the union tweeted numerous times from its official account, invoking Barry positively when commenting on unrelated stories. After his acquittal, Mullins said Barry \"was wronged all along\" and added that he \"should be restored to full duty.\"\n\n(In August 2023, just weeks before Barry was officially terminated from the NYPD, a federal judge sentenced Mullins to two years in federal prison after he pleaded guilty to embezzling $600,000 from the SBA.)\n\nGiven its consistent support, it's perhaps unsurprising that the SBA would then choose to hire Barry, who as of this writing is listed on the union's website as a \"reimbursement coordinator.\"\n\nIn practice, police unions' primary purpose seems to be shielding bad cops from accountability and defending their conduct no matter what. In 2020, two officers with the Buffalo Police Department shoved an unarmed 75-year-old man , whose head hit the pavement and started bleeding. An arbitrator hired by the police union later sided with the officers, determining that the man's fall \"might well have had as much to do with the fact that he was holding objects in each hand or his advanced age\" as the fact that he was forcibly pushed.\n\nBetween October 2015 and March 2021, the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Department reinstated 37 terminated officers-17 of whom had been deemed a \"threat to safety\"-after arbitrators overruled the department, costing district taxpayers $14.3 million.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Journalist Sues Cops Who Handcuffed Him for Photographing 'Cop City' Arrests\n\nPolice\n\nEmma Camp | 7.9.2024 4:27 PM\n\nIn 2022, photojournalist Benjamin Hendren photographed some police officers arresting a group of protesters. Even though Hendren didn't interfere with police activity-he even offered to let the officers speak with his editor-the officers arrested him. What's more, they even encouraged employees at the construction site being protested to fabricate statements about Hendren.\n\nHendren has now filed a lawsuit against the officers who arrested him, arguing he was punished for exercising his First Amendment rights.\n\nOn July 29, 2022, Hendren, a freelance reporter for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution , heard over police radio that there was law enforcement activity at a protest opposing the construction of the Atlanta Public Safety Training Center, also called \" Cop City .\" When Hendren arrived near the site,* he began taking pictures from a public sidewalk across the street from where Georgia State University police officers had arrested a group of protesters who had allegedly trespassed on a construction site.\n\n\"At no point did Hendren commit any crime, and at no point did he do anything that any officer could have mistaken as a crime,\" the lawsuit states. \"Further, Hendren did not interfere in any way with the traffic stop that was being conducted.\"\n\nHowever, police still stopped Hendren and handcuffed him. They \"forcibly took photographs of Hendren while he was handcuffed and sat on the curb,\" according to the suit. Officers even \"grabbed his hair and yanked his head up so he could be photographed against his will.\"\n\nBut the officers didn't just unlawfully detain Hendren. The suit alleges that they encouraged two employees from Brasfield & Gorrie, a construction firm working on Cop City, to make false statements about Hendren, with the pair eventually claiming he \"had committed criminal offenses at the construction site.\" Hendren's suit also names the Brasfield & Gorrie employees as defendants.\n\nAfter this, one of the officers went so far as to write a report stating that Hendren was handcuffed because the employees \"identified him as a protestor inside the construction site.\" But Hendren had been detained before the employees ever saw him, according to the suit. Hendren was eventually released after being detained for over seven hours.\n\nHendren's suit claims that the officers obviously and grossly violated his First Amendment rights. Courts have consistently found that individuals have a right to photograph police activity as long as they don't directly interfere.\n\n\"Plaintiff had a First Amendment right to photograph and film police officers carrying out their official duties in public, without police interference,\" the suit states. \"The interference with Plaintiff's photographing and his arrest were triggered by, and in retaliation for, his protected activity of taking pictures of public police activity, and therefore violated the First Amendment.\"\n\n*CORRECTION: A previous version of this piece misstated the location of the protest and Hendren's location in relation to the protest.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

The 2020 case was heard by U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan in Brooklyn.\n\nFurther details are left out as well. The two BLM rioters threw the Molotov cocktail into an empty police car in New York City, and cut a deal with prosecutors to plead guilty in exchange for reduced charges. The defendants were charged with conspiracy to commit arson and possess an explosive device, with a maximum possible sentencing of five years. As a part of the deal, the defendants paid the city of New York $30,137 each and the prosecutors recommended a sentence of 18 to 24 months.\n\nThe January 6 rioter, Thomas Webster, swung a metal flagpole at a police officer, tackled the officer, and choked him while he attempted to remove the officer's gas mask and helmet. Webster did not plead guilty, instead arguing that he acted in self-defense. The jury did not find his argument convincing and found Webster guilty of five felonies : assaulting, resisting, or impeding officers with a dangerous weapon; obstructing officers during a civil disorder; entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds, while carrying a dangerous weapon; engaging in disorderly or disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds, while carrying a dangerous weapon, and engaging in physical violence in a restricted building or grounds, while carrying a dangerous weapon.\n\nWebster was also found guilty of the misdemeanor of engaging in an act of physical violence in the Capitol building or grounds. In addition to 10 years in prison, Webster received three years of supervised release post-release and a fine of $2,060.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com .

      "text": "There's Never Been a Better Time to Abolish Qualified Immunity\n\nOne of the justice system's most pernicious legal provisions acts as a de facto liability shield for bad cops and other reckless government officials.\n\nGeorge Floyd's death has outraged the public and received near-universal condemnation across the political spectrum. The riots and looting that have broken out in the aftermath have commanded much of our immediate attention, but right-of-center criminal justice reform activists and sympathetic policymakers are hoping the time is finally right to abolish \"qualified immunity,\" one of the justice system's most pernicious legal provisions that acts as a de facto liability shield for bad cops and other reckless government officials.\n\nIn perhaps a high-water mark for the movement against qualified immunity, Rep. Justin Amash, will formally introduce a bill co-sponsored with Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley to abolish the practice. The Supreme Court may also soon take up cases to reconsider the doctrine.\n\nAmash called on his colleagues to co-sponsor the \"Ending Qualified Immunity Act,\" which the congressman says will \"eliminate qualified immunity and restore Americans' ability to obtain relief when police officers violate their constitutionally secured rights.\"\n\n\"The brutal killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police is merely the latest in a long line of incidents of egregious police misconduct,\" Amash and Pressley write . \"This pattern continues because police are legally, politically, and culturally insulated from consequences for violating the rights of the people they have sworn to serve.\"\n\nOf course, \"qualified immunity\" is a term that many are not familiar with.\n\nCornell Law defines qualified immunity as \"a type of legal immunity ... [that] protects a government official from lawsuits alleging that the official violated a plaintiff 's rights, only allowing suits where officials violated a 'clearly established' statutory or constitutional right.\" In practice, this requirement for exact prior cases makes it impossible in most cases to sue a government official who violates your rights in civil court.\n\nThis provision is a creation of the judicial branch and is not in line with what Congress intended to set up. As Amash notes , the Civil Rights Act of 1871 specifically permitted Americans to sue officials who violated their rights, and qualified immunity later emerged through judicial invention. The Supreme Court created the doctrine of qualified immunity in the landmark 1982 decision Harlow v. Fitzgerald , citing \"the need to protect officials who are required to exercise discretion and the related public interest in encouraging the vigorous exercise of official authority.\"\n\nIt has resulted in too many such horror stories and unjust anecdotes to count.\n\nCriminal justice reform analyst Molly Davis tells the story of former inmate Larry Hope, who was \"forced to spend seven hours chained in burning hot metal to a hitching post outside [under the Alabama sun]\" and \"had no bathroom breaks... guards taunted him about his thirst, only offering him water twice throughout the day.\"\n\nWhen Hope tried to sue his jailers after his release, qualified immunity shielded the guards from what seems to be a clearcut violation of Hope's Eighth Amendment rights. Qualified immunity could also make it difficult for George Floyd's family in any civil proceeding.\n\n\"As things currently stand, George Floyd's family may be denied justice in a civil suit unless they can show a substantially similar case where the courts have already agreed that a person's rights were violated,\" Libertas Institute President Connor Boyack told me. \"Justice shouldn't be denied merely because it wasn't granted to someone else first; the current precedent is extremely problematic and closes the door to the courts for people with legitimate claims of wrongdoing.\"\n\n\"It's hard to say for sure whether [officer] Derek Chauvin would be protected by qualified immunity if George Floyd's family brought a civil suit,\" the Cato Institute's Jay Schweikert said. \"But either way, this incident absolutely reinforces the need to abolish qualified immunity.\"\n\nCriminal justice reformers like Boyack and Schweikert argue that the pernicious effects of qualified immunity extend far beyond the denial of justice in specific cases. The experts both agreed that the general existence of a liability shield gives government officials, specifically police officers, a sense of impunity that increases recklessness and abuse.\n\n\"Whether or not Chauvin himself would be covered by it, the senseless violence we saw here is a product of our culture of near-zero accountability for law enforcement - and qualified immunity is one of the biggest drivers of that culture,\" Schweikert said.\n\n\"People naturally respond to incentives, so if officers know that they might be accountable should they use excessive force, they'll be incentivized to restrain themselves more than they are under the status quo,\" said Boyack.\n\nBoth experts support allowing liability-driven market forces to, in absence of qualified immunity, help drive bad actors out of the police force.\n\n\"Consider the interesting idea of requiring officers to obtain liability insurance to financially cover cases where they have [been found] responsible for misconduct. If a certain officer has repeated offenses, they may be uninsurable to a point where they could no longer be employed, thus helping weed out the 'bad cops' everyone agrees do exist.\"\n\n\"Abolishing qualified immunity does raise the question of policies we should put into place to actually fund judgments against police officers,\" Schweikert concurred. \"One proposal that we think is especially promising is requiring police to carry liability insurance, the same way we do with other professionals, like doctors and lawyers. That would mean that, over time, police who routinely commit misconduct would simply be priced out of the market, because their premiums would get too high.\"\n\nIt's, of course, true that no single reform can eliminate racism or repair the structural flaws in our justice system. But within the right-leaning criminal justice reform community, a consensus has formed that eliminating qualified immunity is a great place to start.\n\nBrad Polumbo ( @Brad_Polumbo ) is a libertarian-conservative journalist and former fellow at the Washington Examiner.\n\nPhotograph by Jessica Rinaldi/Boston Globe/Getty Images.\n\nYour membership includes the ability to share articles\n                with friends.

      "text": "Liberals Want 'Defund the Police' to Mean 'Reform.' It Doesn't.\n\nThis isn't a failure to communicate. It's a difference of opinion, and people should say what they mean.\n\nIn these trying times, it's difficult to find something to smile about. But I've found some modicum of mirth watching very sympathetic liberals go the extra mile to help hone the message of activists calling to \"defund the police.\" For instance, Katy Tur, an MSNBC anchor, had Isaac Bryan, the executive director of the Black Policy Project at UCLA on Meet the Press Daily to explain what \"Defund the Police\" really means.\n\n\"Isaac, thank you so much for joining us. Let's talk about what this means because I think there are a lot of people out there who hear 'defund the police' and [think] it means abolishing a police department. It doesn't. So can you explain it to me?\"\n\nBryan very politely replied that he disagreed with the premise of the question. Defund the police doesn't in fact preclude abolishing the police. Bryan says the term means taking that idea \"as far as the political imagination and the political will of our leaders across the country is willing to push this idea.\"\n\nMost Democratic politicians understand that actually abolishing police departments root and branch would be close to political suicide (and terrible policy). Even Sen. Bernie Sanders is against it. They also understand that nobody in America wants the Democrats to embrace this idea more than Donald Trump.\n\nThat's why many liberals want \"Defund the Police\" to mean \"reform the police\" or even \"reinvent the police.\" The problem is the activists who hold the emotional and psychological high ground won't play along. When the mayor of Minneapolis, Jacob Frey, spoke with protesters last week, he said almost everything the crowd wanted about fundamental reform, systemic racism, etc. But when a leader of the protests asked him, \"yes or no\" do you favor outright abolition of the police, he said no. The crowd booed. The leader told him to get the [expletive deleted] out of here. And he wandered off to chants of \"shame\" and a sea of extended middle fingers.\n\nWhat we have here isn't a failure to communicate but a legitimate difference of opinion. Some people favor serious reform. Some favor actual abolition. It doesn't seem unreasonable to me that the people who truly favor abolition should continue to say so and the people who don't should probably stop trying to prove their solidarity by using a slogan they disagree with. And, so far, most prominent Democrats, including presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden have done exactly that.\n\nSo much for the politics. What about the actual ideas?\n\nLet's start with reform. Banning choke holds, redirecting some responsibilities to mental health professionals, EMTs, and social workers has been tried with some success. Moving further on that front is sensible.\n\nRepealing \" qualified immunity \" laws so that police officers can be held more responsible for their actions is more complicated but certainly worth exploring. As a matter of principle, I'm opposed to all public sector unions, even if some do worthwhile things, so I'm certainly open to fresh thinking about police unions.\n\nMany people have focused on the example of Camden, New Jersey, as a model for defunding the police. Except it isn't. In 2012, the cash strapped city decided to disband the existing force, which was rife with corruption and union-fueled dysfunction, and started over. They rehired some 100 officers and committed to retraining. It appears to have been modestly successful. But no one driving through Camden today would mistake it for some cop-free utopia where yeoman citizens police themselves.\n\nBut abolishing the police? That's insane. No really, it's insane. Who will respond to school shootings? Social workers? What about bank robberies? Who will investigate murders? If you just want to rename the police, fine. But the police function is essential to a civilized society. And there are times when that function can only be performed by agents of the government willing and able to use force.\n\nSome defunders propose community patrols, which sound a bit like local militias to me. But whatever name you give them, how does that not create more problems? Do you really want untrained groups of cop wannabes confronting \"suspicious\" characters in a neighborhood? That's how Trayvon Martin got killed by George Zimmerman. All of the problems with race, but also class, would be exacerbated if local communities took it upon themselves to do police work. Affluent, mostly white, communities would have more resources and poorer, mostly black, communities would have fewer.\n\nAnger over George Floyd's killing is justified. But what is true of individuals is also true of mass movements: You don't do your best thinking when you're really angry.\n\nJonah Goldberg is editor-in-chief and co-founder of The Dispatch, based in Washington, D.C.

      "text": "SNAFU-er Than Fiction\n\nThe conspiracy theories on Hunter Biden's conviction are too bizarre even for Hollywood.\n\nDear Reader (including those of you who might be looking for a last-minute Father's Day gift ),\n\nA very long time ago, I read somewhere that, prior to the debut of Hill Street Blues , when cops were asked what the most realistic cop show on TV was, large numbers of them said Barney Miller . Some people still do.\n\nNow, kids, I realize I am aging myself here.\n\nSo just to explain: Hill Street Blues was a gritty, sometimes bleak cop show with lots of cops busting down doors in dingey tenements in dangerous neighborhoods, while Barney Miller was a sitcom, set pretty much entirely in the 12th precinct's detective squad room. Hill Street Blues (and all the imitators it would later inspire) was dramatic, even tragic, albeit with some bits of dark comedy (I particularly miss Vic Hitler the narcoleptic comic). Barney Miller , on the other hand, was pure comedy, while also being one of the most sophisticated sitcoms ever made. It didn't \"tackle\" issues in the heavy-handed way TV producer Norman Lear did. It was an actual sitcom that just assumed the audience was sufficiently well-read to get some of the jokes. My brother would imitate the episode where the Hasidic Jew who was mugged quotes Shakespeare, \"He who steals my purse, steals trash.\" But the Jewish guy says it in the singsong of a rabbinical prayer.\n\nThen there's the episode where Detective Harris is interviewing an Amish farmer who'd been robbed.\n\nDetective Harris : So what do you do for fun? Watch TV?\n\nAmish Farmer : It's not in the Bible.\n\nHarris : Movies?\n\nAmish Farmer : Not in the Bible.\n\nHarris : Play cards? Gamble?\n\nAmish Farmer : It's not in the Bible.\n\nHarris : What DO you DO for fun?\n\nAmish Farmer : Got 14 kids. That's in the Bible.\n\nAnyway, I bring this up because I have a similar attitude about Washington, D.C. With some important caveats that I'll get to in a minute, if I had to pick one show that captures Washington best, I think I'd have to say Veep . I'm hardly alone in this assessment.\n\nNow, in many important ways, Veep isn't that realistic (something I'm sure Kamala Harris has said into the bathroom mirror and shouted at people in the rope line at fundraisers). For starters, the characters are wildly more profane than (most) of the people you meet in Washington.\n\nMore importantly, the show is too cynical. An enormous number of people in Washington-politicians and journalists included-are very smart, sincere, and moral. In my experience, a lot of these people think the most realistic TV shows about Washington are The West Wing or the insufferably smug and self-important show The Newsroom . This is mostly because these are the worlds such people want to live in. A few folks (mostly in Trumpworld these days but there were more than a few in Clintonland) want to live in the world of House of Cards . I suspect that only a small number of the House of Cards -types see themselves as the villainous deformities at the center of that show. They just think their enemies are like that, so they give themselves permission to behave the same way. The thing that all the do-gooders and the do-evilers have in common is they take themselves incredibly seriously. And one of the great things about Veep is it makes fun of all of them.\n\nBut the real reason I think Veep is the most realistic-or to put it more accurately, captures the most reality-is that it grasps the fact that nobody is really in control. The smartest plans get foiled by dumb people or by smart people looking after their own interests. Random events bedevil the best-laid plans. Great things often happen by accident and intentionally terrible things often backfire. The cats in Congress or the press won't be herded. And the dogs of the electorate won't eat the dog food. It's all exaggerated for comedic effect, but that's a big part of what comedy is: reducing reality to a recognizable, absurd truth.\n\nThis is one of the things I often find myself trying to explain to people, mostly from outside Washington, but often to people who live and work here. No one is in charge. There's no cabal controlling things. Cui bono -who benefits?-is a shorthand for a whole way of thinking about politics and life. It's not always wrong, but it usually is.\n\nIn Washington, events that help one group are often the result of mistakes made by another group. As often as not, calamities are the result not of carefully orchestrated plots by enemies, but the unintended results of players screwing things up themselves. Every day in Washington, activists, donors, lobbyists, politicians, and consultants gather in rooms and restaurants and plot new initiatives, schemes, awareness campaigns, whatever. Earnest young people scribble notes and managers write things on grease boards. Ten-point plans are hammered out. Media campaigns are designed. Stakeholders are co-opted or coerced to get with the program. These projects are rolled out with great fanfare, then proceed to roll into a ditch, or collide smack-dab into another boulder rolling in the opposite direction, or get knocked off-course by a third one from another direction.\n\nWhen Barack Obama launched the website for Obamacare-the most discussed, planned, touted, denounced, and celebrated program of the last 20 years-the website didn't work . As I used to joke, it was like these economic planners hired the best web techies the Amish community ever produced. His stimulus plan was sold on the premise that millions of \"shovel-ready jobs\" were simply awaiting funding. But once funded, no one grabbed their shovels because it would take years to get the paperwork sorted out. Obama had to pivot to the claim that he \"saved or created\" millions of jobs, a conveniently unfalsifiable argument. And since I'm recycling old jokes, let me boast for a moment that I do or save 1,000 push-ups every morning. I harp on Obama because no president in my lifetime was more committed to the idea that if you just hand the reins to experts with spreadsheets and checklists, anything is possible.\n\nBut he was hardly alone. Jimmy Carter, a nuclear engineer by training and personality, thought you could run everything from the White House. And he was consistent on this point. He actually got so annoyed with the Veep -like chaos of his staff, he reportedly took over the job of managing the sign-up schedule of the White House tennis court.\n\nAnyway, I bring this up for two reasons. First, a bunch of people have complained about my last couple of G-Files taking too long to get their point, and I'm in a you-ain't-seen-nothin'-yet kind of mood.\n\nSecond, because I think the response to Hunter Biden's conviction from the MAGA right is bonkers.\n\nNick Catoggio wrote a great piece on all the swirling issues involved, and it's full of examples of what I'm talking about. \"Hunter Biden guilty. Yawn,\" tweeted Charlie Kirk. \"The true crimes of the Biden Crime Family remain untouched. This is a fake trial trying to make the Justice system appear 'balanced.' Don't fall for it.\"\n\n\"The Hunter Biden prosecution is a fake distraction, designed to deflect attention from the real crimes of using Joe Biden to make $$ for his family in Ukraine & to create the artifice of 'nonpartisanship' in the DOJ after the Trump conviction. Don't fall for the trick,\" proclaimed Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nThis is very stupid.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong. I think it is entirely possible that Hunter Biden committed many other crimes. He's going on trial for some of them- three felony tax charges and six misdemeanors-in September, but I think many of his other schemes are super sketchy and quite possibly illegal as well. I don't rule out that his uncle-or even his dad-broke some laws. I don't think that's been proven, but I also don't think it's been remotely disproven.\n\nWhat's ever so stupid is the idea that the supposedly utterly corrupt-\"weaponized!\"-Department of Justice that is doing Joe Biden's bidding brought Hunter to trial, won a conviction, and is bringing him to trial again, right before the election , because that's exactly what Joe Biden wants. The Democrats want to run against Donald Trump's corruption. They want to hammer home that he's a felon. And, according to galaxy brains like Kirk and Ramaswamy, the famously sentimental Joe Biden fiendishly manipulated events so that his sole surviving son would get convicted and possibly face jail time? Everything we know about Joe Biden's relationship with Hunter is that he loves him and cares about him. Indeed, most of the theories about the \"Biden Crime Family\" hinge on the idea that the president has a blind spot for Hunter's criminality. I've seen no reason to doubt that he's rightly worried that the stress of prosecution-and conviction-could cause Hunter to relapse.\n\nBut as you can say almost anytime Kirk opens his mouth, \"Wait, it gets dumber.\" The MAGA right, and Republicans generally, are enormously invested in the claim that Joe Biden is a senile dotard who barely knows where he is. But they also want us to believe that he's maneuvering events like some four-dimensional chess master? The guy who reads \"pause\" from the teleprompter and insists his son did nothing wrong is brilliantly orchestrating his son's criminal prosecution? Pick a lane, people.\n\nNow, in fairness, this sort of stupidity has a long bipartisan lineage. Many on the left loved to say that George W. Bush was simultaneously a complete idiot and a criminal super genius, leading the country into war for the benefit of oil companies, or the Joooos . Some fringy types insisted that he was a moron and that he pulled off the most spectacular \"inside job\" on 9/11. Spike Lee, among others, floated the idea that Bush ordered the bombing of the levee in New Orleans in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Bush was such a great administrator he managed to pull off these sorts of things without a single whistle-blower.\n\nThe thing I always find so baffling about these kinds of arguments is that they never account for the fact that, if presidents were so good at executing incredibly complex criminal conspiracies, why couldn't they actually do the normal government stuff better? Joe Biden can't get his infrastructure stuff to work, but he can get the DOJ to pull off incredibly complex schemes without a hitch? Maybe he should order some of the top folks at the DOJ to build a pier off Gaza that doesn't float away or to build some electric car charging stations . If Bush could pull off 9/11, surely he could have gotten Social Security reform through Congress.\n\nNow, I can't say for certain whether the Ramaswamy and Kirk types actually believe what they're saying. That's always impossible to know, because people like them don't think belief-let alone truth-is a prerequisite for any of their opinions. But lots of normal people believe this kind of thing.\n\nI think there are lots of reasons for this, but the relevant one brings us back to TV (and movies and novels). Fiction requires boiling reality down to a story. You can have distractions, red herrings, and Russian-in-the-Pine-Barrens non-sequiturs, but ultimately you have to land at your desired destination. The old line- attributed to countless people-goes, \"How do you sculpt an elephant? Take a block of stone and remove everything that doesn't look like an elephant.\"\n\nThat's how fiction works. Take everything out that doesn't fit your story (this is a great rule for proper writing and one that I studiously avoid in this \"news\"letter). I've made this point about the Chekhov's gun rule many times. It's why you can be certain that, in any normal sitcom, a character who gets pregnant is going to keep the baby. Unless you're deliberately being political, you don't want a character to have a miscarriage or an abortion. Scriptwriters often reduce the motives of villains to simple greed or revenge because complex motivations are hard to convey. This laziness is one reason businessmen are so often cast as villains: It's just easier.\n\nBut motivations in real life are often messier. Deliberate, intentional villainy is much rarer than you'd think from movies and TV shows (though obviously it exists). Competence at pulling off incredibly complex capers and conspiracies is even more rare. But when you watch the news like it's exposition in a movie or a TV show-editing out the parts of life that don't fit the plot that's in your head-it becomes easy to think that Washington is full of masterminds and that every inconvenient fact and event is really just a red herring.\n\nWhatever line of work you're in, I am sure you have stories about how things went haywire, mistakes were made, miscommunications and mishaps led to something that made onlookers not just angry but convinced that the screw-up was intentional. And then it falls to you to explain how it was just a normal snafu and nobody intended it. There's a reason why SNAFU stands for \"situation normal: all [fouled] up.\" Because that sort of thing is normal-in life, and in Washington. And that's what Veep gets right.\n\nCanine Update: There's not too much to report and I am extremely pressed for time. Everyone is good, though no one is happy about the end of the cool weather, but it's still cool enough in the morning for Pippa to get some work in. The girls were scheduled to get a bath today, so I may get an earful from them about the injustice and from the missus for not being there to help.\n\nSpeaking of the missus, we went to a Dispatch cookout at Steve Hayes' place last night. As you might have read in The Morning Dispatch , Declan Garvey's birthday cake was dropped on my foot by accident. I told Declan that he should be happy about this, because there's an old Irish saying: \"May your birthday cake be dropped on old Jew's foot.\" It sounds better in the original Gaelic. The girls were very happy to see us when we got home, and to help clean the remaining residue off my foot.\n\nPeople often respond to these \"welcoming committee\" videos by noting the contrast between Gracie's seemingly indifferent response and the dogs' speaks volumes about the differences between cats and dogs. Dogs: \"We missed you so much! It's fantastic you're home! We thought you'd never come back!\" versus \"Oh, hi. Whatever.\" There's obviously some truth to this. But it overlooks the fact that Gracie almost always gets out of a comfortable spot (unlike Pippa , she occupies no other kind of spot) and comes to the door, too. That she's more restrained is a testament to her catness. But that she gets up in the first place is a testament to her awesomeness. She likes to keep an eye on me in particular.\n\nIn other news, Kirsten tries valiantly to get pictures of Zoë smiling.
