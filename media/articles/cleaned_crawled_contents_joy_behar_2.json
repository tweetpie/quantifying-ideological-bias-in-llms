      "text": "The View's Joy Behar threatens to quit over 'entitled b*tch' Meghan McCain  -  who staffers call the 'ice princess'\n\nJoy Behar and Meghan McCain, daughter of the late Sen. John McCain, have butted heads more than a few times on ABC's \"The View.\" But their exchanges were especially heated on December 4, when Behar and McCain during a segment on the passing of former president George H. W. Bush. And, according to the Daily Mail, the tension between Behar and McCain has reached the point where Behar is threatening to leave the popular daytime talk show.\n\nBush, the United States' 41st president, died on Friday, November 30 at the age of 94, and a recurring theme in the mainstream media-even among some liberals like veteran New York Times journalist Maureen Dowd-is that Bush 41 was capable of being polite to Democrats despite policy differences with them. That theme was very much at work on \"The View\" on December 4, with host Whoopi Goldberg pointing to Bush as an example of \"how you can not agree with somebody but be respectful of somebody. That's the thing I think I dug the most: him rolling with Bill Clinton.\"\n\nThe 76-year-old Behar, an outspoken liberal and frequent critic of President Donald Trump, spoke favorably of Bush 41's environmental record and noted that he signed into law an amendment to the Clean Air Act in 1990. Behar quickly added that Trump, in comparison, has a terrible environmental record-and McCain interrupted, curtly saying, \"Can we focus on the president, please? I don't want to talk about Trump.\"\n\nBehar shot back that she didn't care what McCain wanted to talk about-she was making a point. That's when \"The View\" cut to a commercial, and according to The Daily Mail, the tension escalated off-air.\n\nThe Daily Mail alleges that off the air, Behar said of McCain, \"Get this bi*ch under control.... I've tolerated a lot of shit on this show, but I'm at my wits' end with this entitled b*tch. Enough already! Enough already! I'm not playing nice any longer.\"\n\nThe Daily Mail also quoted Behar as saying, \"If this sh*t doesn't stop, I'm quitting this damn show. I can't take this much more.\"\n\nThe report also claimed staffers mock McCain as an \"ice princess\" for her cold demeanor.\n\nThe 34-year-old McCain, a conservative Republican who has often been critical of Trump-not unlike her father-was one of the hosts of Fox News' \"Outnumbered\" but left that program and joined \"The View\" in October 2017. Behar, meanwhile, has been with \"The View\" since its inception in 1997."

      "text": "How we view the women of 'The View': Our awareness of gender bias in political coverage should also apply to how we interpret ABC's daytime talk series\n\nIn case you missed it, on Wednesday morning Meghan McCain called her co-host and colleague Joy Behar a bitch. And she did it on air, on morning television, on ABC's \"The View.\"\n\nMcCain, who usually sits quietly during discussions of hot topics statements and opts to weigh in at the end, referred to herself as the show's \"sacrificial Republican.\" In response Behar cooed a sarcastic, \"awwww.\"\n\nThat's when the sacrificial lamb growled. \"Oh, don't feel bad for me, bitch. I'm paid to do this, OK? Don't feel bad for me.\"\n\nFollowing a well-timed commercial break, Behar and McCain explained to viewers that they use the term affectionately and frequently backstage, reassuring everyone that they enjoy each other's company - they just like to box sometimes, that's all. McCain also used that moment to remind the audience that she wrote a book called \"America, You Sexy Bitch: A Love Letter to Freedom.\"\n\nBehar and McCain's exchange made headlines mainly because of, I mean, that word . Uttered in the gentle climes of daytime television no less. What may have gotten lost in the brouhaha is the hot topic that instigated it: McCain and Behar were talking about whether Donald Trump's official campaign kick-off in Florida was an accurate indicator of whether his base is still passionate about him. McCain attempted to make the case that it is, and explain why.\n\n\"Democrats still have a lot to overcome. A lot of people are still enthusiastic,\" she said, going on to add, \"Sometimes it's not just they love Trump so much. It's they hate the same things Trump hates. That's what's going on.\"\n\nThen Behar responded by asking what, exactly, is the object of the shared hatred. \"Black people? Do you mean immigrants? Who do they hate?\" This is what set off McCain.\n\n\"The View\" has been a ratings champ and a reliable online traffic driver for many years, owing to a tendency among those who regularly cover the series to write up the fireworks as opposed to examining what the performers are doing at the fair. This is a mixed blessing, I suppose.\n\nFew other daytime series have a panel as varied, outspoken and eager to debate as Barbara Walters' creation, a group that easily connects to its stay-at-home audience by discussing politics with the same lightness as, say, fashion trends or the action on an episode of \"The Real Housewives of New York.\" They're the neighborhood coffee crew people would invite into their homes, if only their neighbors lived closer, or if they spoke to them at all.\n\nAt the same time, \"The View\" is also about as close to a modern, friendlier version of \"Crossfire,\" the CNN debate series that evolved from a friendly if heated exchange of ideas to a viper pit, as Jon Stewart famously accused it of being, a den of \"partisan hackery\" that was \"hurting America.\" Granted \"The View\" rarely if ever veers into the acid bog of screaming and nonsense where \"Crossfire\" finds itself. But to evaluate the tenor of some post-episode coverage of the series, one might be right to fear it could be headed in that direction.\n\nSome interpretations of \"The View\" debates are gendered, however, in much the same way political coverage tends to be during election years. The road to 2020 already is shaping up to repeat the past, as witnessed in the coverage of Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and her alleged mood swings . In some quarters there's a heightened awareness of language concerning likability or electability , that writers are more likely to require women and candidates of color to meet those expectations than white male candidates. And that same filter, whether intentionally or not, tends to be applied to \"The View.\"\n\nAnd as we approach the Democratic primary season in earnest, it'll be a fascinating to see how this bias manifests in post-episode coverage of ABC's daytime hit.\n\n\"The View\" is as essential a stop for 2020 candidates as late-night variety shows are, all of which are hosted by men. And yet at times pop culture coverage seems to slump it into an adjacent category to Bravo's \"Real Housewives\" series, as if its panelists are bickering as opposed to debating.\n\nBut even people who don't watch the series are aware of rumors of behind-the-scenes tension between McCain and Behar and, to a certain degree, moderator Whoopi Goldberg.\n\nThe show's been around since 1997, but 2019 seems the year the New York Times Magazine sat up and took notice of the group's role in political kingmaking, likely due at least in part to the popularity of journalist Ramin Setoodeh 's \"Ladies Who Punch: The Explosive Inside Story of 'The View.'\"\n\nMcCain in particular produces more of the show's viral moments than her other co-hosts, although Behar and Goldberg contribute their share of jaw-droppers on a regular basis as well.\n\nThis week, in fact, Goldberg ignited a couple of debates on Twitter when she defended Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's comments about working with segregationists, and when she reacted to Bella Thorne's decision to thwart a blackmailer by making nude photos of herself public by saying that famous people should not take nude photos. \"Once you take that picture, it goes into the cloud, and it's available to any hacker who wants it,\" Goldberg told viewers. \"If you don't know that in 2019, this is an issue, I'm sorry, but you don't get to do that.\"\n\nAs candidates such as Beto O'Rourke and Marianne Williamson found out, \"The View\" is not an easy appearance compared to sitting down with the likes of Jimmy Kimmel or Jimmy Fallon.\n\nMcCain and Behar are particularly tough; this week, in response to Williamson's position that being a political outsider with no experience in government makes her a better option in 2020 than her fellow candidates, both women pointedly shut her down by remarking that this was Trump's position in 2016.\n\nOn that note my condolences to Washington governor Jay Inslee, who the panel declared on Friday to be such an also-ran that McCain forgot he visited the show -\"Way to make an impression, bro!\" she crowed - and Williamson, to whom McCain quipped, \"you're wasting our collective time.\"\n\nConflict and controversy are essential spices to the show's \"team of rivals\" formula.  Adding newest co-host Abby Huntsman, with Republican strategist and political commentator Ana Navarro stepping in weekly, tempers the bite, but only somewhat.\n\nHowever, \"The View\" is also a prime platform to explore issues that matter most to women who are making up their minds about who they're voting for - and not just the issues about which specific candidates are banging their drums.  Hopefully people will appreciate this more than the sniping.\n\nEvery candidate will have something to say about the economy and health care, but not everyone will have a plan to close the gender pay gap, ease the burden of child care costs and move toward a solution to improve the precarious rises in living costs in major cities - all issues important to female voters, the demographic predicted to be one of the key groups of swing voters .\n\nAnd this is all on top of discussions concerning reproductive rights and abortion - issues Goldberg and McCain have been vocal about on \"The View\" and, in the case of the anti-choice McCain, in newspaper editorials.\n\nPanelists on \"The View\" have discussed all of these subjects. In the case of abortion rights, Goldberg has vowed to keep an eye on developments as the battles rage through the courts. Going forward, whether the essential information the series provides its viewers will cut through the fog of sniping is hard to say. Hostin, an analyst for ABC, often shares context with viewers by way of reading definitions of legal terms or explaining what certain political developments mean. Unfortunately for her and viewers in general, we don't often see her featured in conversations regarding that day's dish.\n\nMedia analysts generally tend to laud comedians for their edginess while the action of \"The View,\" circulated largely via viral bites, receives write-arounds focusing on their mockery. Even its hosts acknowledge this; in one of the past week's lighter discussion segments, the ladies discussed clips from a recent episode of \"The Real Housewives of New York\" featuring Bethenny Frankel caught in a frantic meltdown.\n\nInadvertently, perhaps, that segment exemplified the contrast between heightened reality and \"Hot Topic\" debate. \"All I know is they make us look civilized,\" Behar jokes. Let's remember that."

Adam Schiff\n\nThe Ukraine scandal and House Democrats' decision to move forward with an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump has been a prominent topic on ABC's \"The View,\" and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow jumped into the debate with co-hosts Meghan McCain, Abby Huntsman, Joy Behar and Whoopi Goldberg during a guest appearance on Wednesday.\n\nAlthough the conservative McCain shares the disdain that her late father, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, had for Trump, the Republican activist is often quick to attack Democrats on the ABC talk show. And on Wednesday, McCain and Huntsman were critical of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff's role in the impeachment inquiry - insisting that Schiff lacks credibility because he is a partisan Democrat.\n\nEchoing GOP talking points, McCain asserted, \"I keep saying that Adam Schiff is the wrong person to do this because if we are going to go forward with impeachment, it needs to be as clean and look as nonpartisan as possible.\" And McCain went on to ask Maddow if Schiff's actions, \"muddy the case.\"\n\nMaddow, in response, explained, \"Whistleblowers come forward all the time to the House Intelligence Committee, which is run by Democrats - also to the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is run by Republicans. And both of those committees have now said, 'Yeah, this happens all the time, and we always do the same thing - which is that we have them speak with a staffer, and then, the staffer tells them to get a lawyer and file a whistleblower complaint.'\"\n\nMaddow added, \"On the House side, they say this happens two or three times a month. This is just a normal thing.\"\n\nMcCain pressed on, however, asking Maddow if she thinks Schiff's involvement \"muddies the waters\" - to which the MSNBC host responded, \"No, I don't. I also feel like this focus on who the whistleblower is and how the whistleblower's complaint was handled - both by the Republicans and Democrats - is a side story.\"\n\nWatch the video below:\n\n﻿"

      "text": "'Get your freaking job done': Meghan McCain mocks 'wannabe TV star' Republican Matt Gaetz for his absurd stunt\n\nMeghan McCain was not impressed by the band of House Republicans who stormed a closed-door impeachment hearing of President Donald Trump on Wednesday in opposition of an alleged lack of transparency in the investigation - and even ordered pizza to fuel their protest.\n\n\"Let us in! Let us in!\" cried the pro-Trump lawmakers, led by Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla.\n\nVoting members of Congress are being denied access from being able to see what's happening behind these closed doors where they're trying to impeach the president of the United States with a one-sided set of rules. They call the witnesses,\" declared Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La. \"This is a Soviet-style process. It should not be allowed in the United States of America. Every member of Congress ought to be allowed in that room. The press ought to be allowed in that room.\"\n\nThe move, widely condemned as a political stunt, came under intense scrutiny of \"The View\" co-hosts Thursday on ABC.\n\nCo-host Abby Huntsman noted that Gaetz was reportedly filming a documentary series for HBO titled \"The Swamp\" - and allegedly broke House rules to get the show's crew members into the Capitol building in order to film the spectacle. She pointed out that House Republicans were \"asking to be arrested just to make it a bigger deal,\" citing reporting by Fox News reporter Chad Pergram .\n\n\"Everything is political. But, at the end of the day, if you are one of their constituents, doesn't this frustrate you?\" Huntsman continued. \"There is no substance here.\"\n\nHuntsman's remarks appeared to resonate with McCain, who then declared, \"I hate political stunts across the board, in general. I think we elect people in order to serve in Congress.\"\n\nComparing what Republicans did this week to the Democratic sit-in for gun control in 2016, she said, \"It was party politics - optics just simply for protests and sake of the camera. Democrats shouldn't be doing it. Republicans shouldn't be doing it.\"\n\n\"We elect you to get your freaking job done one way or the other,\" she continued. \"And when you are sitting on a sit-in for 26 hours, or you're doing what Republicans did yesterday, it's the reason why Congress has a 13 percent approval rating.\"\n\n\"By the way, Matt Gaetz, when did you become a TV star or wannabe TV star?\" she asked. \"You want to do that? Get the hell out of Congress! Get a TV job! But you're probably not interesting enough to do it.\"\n\n\"No one's going to hire him,\" co-host Joy Behar chimed in. \"He's boring.\"\n\nIt was a rare moment of agreement between McCain and Behar, who said earlier of Republicans, \"I think they're scared because - you know, because Trump said that any never-Trumpers are considered 'scum.'\"\n\n\"So they don't want to be labeled as 'scum' in his eyes, and they're afraid of getting thrown out of their job,\" Behar continued. \"And it's just based on pure - you know, fear. Just fear and cowardice in my opinion.\"\n\nCo-host Sunny Hostin, a former federal prosecutor, said the political gambit revealed that the president was \"afraid\" as House Democrats press forward with their impeachment inquiry .\n\n\"He's running scared, and he's trying to gin up support,\" she added. \"In the law, we often say if you can't attack the law, you attack the process. That's what you're hearing . . . This is nothing but political theater . . . but it felt a lot like witness intimidation to me.\"\n\nIn recent days, Trump has been calling on congressional Republicans to \"get tougher and fight,\" signaling he may be growing concerned about the possibility that members of his own party will break with him and join the Democrats' impeachment effort.\n\nIn a post shared to Twitter and pinned to his profile Wednesday, Trump wrote, \"The Never Trumper Republicans, though on respirators with not many left, are in certain ways worse and more dangerous for our Country than the Do Nothing Democrats. Watch out for them, they are human scum!\""

      "text": "GOP's 'bizarre and dangerous' rhetoric masks these 'quieter, more dangerous plans': analysis\n\nLiberal and progressive media outlets are full of articles attacking former President Donald Trump , Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) and other far-right MAGA Republicans for offensive remarks. But a recent analysis warns Americans to not let themselves get distracted.\n\nTrump's \"the enemy within\" and Vance's \"childless cat ladies\" comments have received a lot of scathing analysis on MSNBC and Salon, and Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders' attack on Vice President Kamala Harris for not having biological children was slammed as hateful and mean-spirited by everyone from MSNBC host Joe Scarborough (a Never Trump conservative and former GOP congressman) to Joy Behar on \"The View.\"\n\nBut in an article published on October 22 , The New Republic's Kate Aronoff argues that the most \"dangerous\" thing about Republicans isn't the \"outlandish things\" they say - it's what they are quietly planning behind the scenes.\n\n\"From JD Vance falsely claiming that Haitian immigrants in Ohio are eating pets to Trump railing against domestic 'enemies,'\" Aronoff explains , \"Republicans' more unhinged talking points have gotten a lot of airtime this election season. That's understandable: that rhetoric is dangerous in its own right, fueling very real threats to the people Republicans are targeting.\"\n\nAronoff goes on to say , however, that it is a \"mistake to see the candidates who say the most outlandish things as the ones who pose the biggest threat.\"\n\nThe journalist emphasizes , \"Arguably more dangerous are the kind of well-considered plans being put forward by the likes of the American Exploration & Production Council (AXPC), a lobby group whose internal strategy documents were recently leaked by the climate nonprofit Fieldnotes.... There's nothing especially outlandish about a trade association advocating for policies that will pad their members' bottom lines; that's the reason these groups exist. Unsurprisingly, as AXPC's leaked policy roadmap shows, those policies are easier to come by if Republicans control more parts of the federal government.\"\n\nAronoff, however, isn't saying that offensive comments by Republicans should be ignored - only that it's important to look behind the scenes as well.\n\n\"Republicans say a lot of bizarre and dangerous things these days that deserve attention,\" Aronoff writes . \"But at the same time, fixating on whatever wild thing MAGA World says about wind turbines creating bird graveyards might well be helping to pull attention away from the GOP and its donors' quieter, more dangerous plans for how to govern - and their similarly quiet efforts to build bipartisan consensus for implementing them.\"\n\nRead Kate Aronoff's full article for The New Republic at this link ."

The conservative pundit will be working on the 2020 campaign of her father, former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman - who is running for that position again.

It's no secret that McCain (a Never Trump conservative and daughter of the late Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain) has had a testy relationship with co-host Joy Behar, but while Behar is an outspoken liberal, Huntsman shares many of McCain's right-wing views.\n\nAccording to Stelter and Darcy, Huntsman and McCain \"were allies behind the scenes until recently,\" but their relationship \"soured\" over a \"recent dispute\" involving \"child-centric chats\" on the show. McCain, who suffered a miscarriage, \"confronted Huntsman for bringing up her kids on the show,\" Stelter and Darcy report.\n\n\"Abby was sick of being berated by Meghan for perceived slights,\" a source told CNN Business. \"She ultimately decided she didn't need this job, and it wasn't worth it.\"\n\nAnother source told CNN Business, \"Meghan has been miserable there for quite some time, and not because of Abby.

Mike Lee (R-UT) went on \"The View\" to defend President Donald Trump's actions described in the Mueller report, and it went so badly that he trotted out a fake definition of the word \"politics.\"\n\nThe Utah Republican told panelists that he was relieved special counsel Robert Mueller hadn't uncovered evidence of a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, and family friend Abby Huntsman asked if saw anything in the 448-page report that gave him pause.\n\n\"There are lots of things in there that people don't find comforting,\" Lee said. \"There were lots of things in there that were not flattering.\"\n\nCo-host Joy Behar asked if he saw any evidence of illegal activity.\n\n\"I was relieved to see there was nothing establishing collusion,\" Lee said. \"There's been a lot of talk about collusion over the last two years.\n\nSunny Hostin, a former federal prosecutor, scolded Lee for making that claim.\n\n\"Collusion isn't even a federal crime, counselor,\" Hostin said. \"You're a former prosecutor, you know that.\"\n\nLee agreed collusion wasn't listed as a crime, but went right back to talking about it.\n\n\"People were worried about collusion,\" he said. \"It was collusion that gave rise to concerns that there might have been some type of obstruction. I didn't see any evidence of a crime or a plan to bring forth charges against the president. So after two years of searching, the fact that they came out and don't have anything there, it indicates to me it's time to move on. I suspect many of my colleagues will disagree. They won't be ready to move on, I am.\"\n\nBehar asked the senator if had been concerned by apparent attempts to obstruct justice, which the president's aides and attorneys told Mueller they refused to carry out.\n\n\"Look, the fact he thought about doing certain things and was later walked off the ledge from that by some very capable staff members who pointed out it wasn't a good idea, is itself comforting,\" Lee said.\n\nBehar pushed back harder.\n\n\"They kept telling him it wasn't a good idea, and he tried somebody else, and then somebody else and then somebody else,\" she said.\n\nHostin then jumped in to correct Lee's account of Trump's actions.\n\n\"Not only that, but he asked people to do things and they didn't do it,\" Hostin said. \"It's not that he walked them off the ledge - they didn't do it. That's attempt, that's a crime.\"\n\nLee responded by quoting a folksy joke about politics that's credited to the late Robin Williams that's frequently shared on social media.\n\n\"They say that the word politics can best be understood when you break it down to its Greek roots,\" Lee said. \"'Poly,' meaning many, and ticks, which are blood-sucking parasites. You put them together, and it doesn't end well.\"\n\nHostin glared at Lee and sucked her teeth, and he moseyed back toward the topic.\n\n\"There are things in politics that happen that are not pleasant, that are not flattering, and we certainly saw some in this report,\" Lee said. \"Nonetheless, I don't look at that and see criminal activity or see a basis for impeachment.\"\n\nCo-host Meghan McCain asked Lee what the GOP reaction would have been if a Democratic president had done what Trump is accused of doing, and the senator insisted nothing would change.\n\n\"They would find features of it unflattering,\" Lee said. \"Some would be calling for impeachment. If some were calling for impeachment, I would be trying to walk them off that ledge, because it doesn't end well.\"\n\nBehar called him out, saying Republicans impeached Bill Clinton over an extramarital affair.\n\n\"How did that work out for them?\" Lee smirked. \"That didn't work out well for the Republican Party.\""

      "text": "Joy Behar of 'The View' apologizes for Christianity comment\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - Joy Behar of \"The View\" apologized Tuesday for suggesting mental illness was behind claims by people that Jesus Christ talks to them, in remarks made on her show last month about Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nHer comments launched a protest that made it all the way to a shareholder's meeting of ABC parent Walt Disney Corp. Pence said on Monday that when Behar called him personally to say she was sorry, he urged her to apologize publicly.\n\nSo she did at the top of Tuesday's show.\n\n\"I was raised to respect everyone's religious faith and I fell short of that,\" the comedian said. \"I sincerely apologize for what I said.\"\n\nShow moderator Whoopi Goldberg quickly moved on.\n\nBehar's original comments came on a Feb. 13 show during a discussion that touched upon Pence's Christianity. \"It's one thing to talk to Jesus,\" Behar said. \"It's another thing when Jesus talks to you. That's called mental illness, if I'm not correct - hearing voices.\"\n\n\"My question is, can he talk to Mary Magdalene without his wife in the room?\" she said.\n\nOn the same show, Behar said she did not believe Pence was mentally ill and that he would make a better president than Donald Trump. But the damage had been done. Pence spoke out against the remarks, and \"The View\" returned to the topic two days later. Behar mentioned being a Christian herself who gives money to her church.\n\nShe called it a joke gone awry. \"I don't mean to offend people,\" she said, \"but apparently I keep doing it.\"\n\nThe conservative Media Research Center launched a campaign that its president, Brent Bozell, said Tuesday resulted in some 40,000 protest phone calls being placed to ABC and 9,000 to advertisers on \"The View.\"\n\nIn response to a question at a shareholder's meeting last week, Disney Corp. chief executive Robert Iger said that Behar had called Pence to apologize. The vice president confirmed that in his interview Monday with Sean Hannity of Fox News Channel.\n\n\"I felt it was important that I defend the faith of tens of millions of Americans against that kind of slander,\" Pence said. \"And I did so. And you know, I give Joy Behar a lot of credit. She picked up the phone. She called me. She was very sincere, and she apologized and one of the things my faith teaches me is grace; forgive as you've been forgiven.\"\n\nHe said he told her that it was also important to apologize to all that were upset by what she said.\n\n\"The apology is appropriate,\" said the MRC's Bozell. \"One wishes she never said it, and one wishes she had apologized the moment she realized how many people she offended. But she did and it should be accepted.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(Photo by Dario Cantatore/Invision/AP, File)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - Joy Behar and ABC were silent Thursday after an old photo resurfaced of \"The View\" co-host using makeup to darken her skin for a Halloween costume, the latest flashpoint in a series of blackface scandals making national headlines.\n\nThe 76-year-old didn't mention the clip on Thursday's show, one day after an editor for the entertainment website The Wrap tweeted the three-year-old segment of Behar discussing a resurgence of curly hair.\n\nDuring the 2016 segment, Behar displayed a 1970s-era photo of herself at a Halloween party when she was 29. She says that the hair was her own and that she had dressed as a \"beautiful African woman.\"\n\nCo-host Raven-Symone asked whether she had on tanning lotion. Behar, an outspoken liberal, said she wore makeup \"that was a little bit darker than my skin.\"\n\nMessages seeking comment were not returned from Behar's agent and the ABC program.\n\nCritics were quick to point out that NBC cut ties with host Megyn Kelly last year after she created a furor by suggesting that it was OK for white people to wear blackface on Halloween.\n\nThis week, Virginia's governor and attorney general are being criticized for their use of blackface. Florida Secretary of State Michael Ertel resigned last month after a photo surfaced showing him wearing blackface and dressing as a \"Hurricane Katrina victim.\"\n\nOther white celebrities who have been called out for using blackface include Julianne Hough, who in 2012 dressed as characters from Netflix's \"Orange Is the New Black,\" and \"Real Housewives of New York\" star LuAnn De Lesseps, who dressed as Diana Ross for Halloween in 2017.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Rittenhouse has not filed a lawsuit against any individual or organization, his spokesperson told The Associated Press.\n\nTHE FACTS: Social media posts circulating over the weekend falsely claimed that Rittenhouse, the 18-year-old who was recently acquitted of homicide charges after shooting three people during a protest in Wisconsin, had filed the defamation suits.\n\n\"Kyle Rittenhouse has filed a $60 million defamation lawsuit against the View's Joy Behar and Whoopi Goldberg. Let the games begin,\" reads one Facebook post that was shared thousands of times and garnered over 540,000 views.\n\nThe claim about the suit against the two \"The View\" co-hosts also appeared widely on Twitter. Other users on Twitter separately claimed that Rittenhouse had sued CNN.\n\nBut both claims are false, according to David Hancock, a spokesperson for the Rittenhouse family.\n\n\"None of them are true,\" Hancock told the AP. \"The Rittenhouse team, Kyle and the rest of his lawyers, have not filed any legal actions against any organizations or any person in particular.\"\n\nA Twitter account for the Free Kyle defense fund, which Hancock confirmed is tied to a fundraising effort launched by Rittenhouse's mother, Wendy Rittenhouse, specifically rebutted the CNN claim.\n\n\"As of now, the Rittenhouse team has NOT filed any legal actions against media organizations...,\" a tweet issued from the account on Saturday states.\n\nAsked if Rittenhouse had any plans to file defamation lawsuits in the future, Hancock said it is \"not a bridge that has been crossed yet.\"\n\n\"It could be possible in the future, but I would say that nobody is sitting around planning anything,\" he added.\n\nRittenhouse fatally shot two men and injured a third during a night of protests against police brutality in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in August 2020. He was tried on charges including first-degree reckless homicide. Rittenhouse argued that he fired in self-defense after being attacked, and a jury acquitted him on all charges on Nov. 19.\n\n___\n\nThis is part of AP's effort to address widely shared misinformation, including work with outside companies and organizations to add factual context to misleading content that is circulating online.

McCain says she decided to leave \"The View\" following her second day back from maternity leave in January after a comment was made by fellow panelist Behar during a political argument. The incident is one of several backstage stories in McCain's new book, \"Bad Republican.\" (AP Photo)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - Meghan McCain says she decided to leave \"The View\" following her second day back from maternity leave in January when frequent foil Joy Behar said \"I did not miss you\" during a political argument.\n\nMcCain, who left this summer after four years as the daytime talk show's conservative voice, told that and other backstage stories in a new book, \"Bad Republican,\" and a subsequent interview with Variety.\n\nMcCain had announced on July 1 that she was leaving \"The View\" because she did not want to be uprooted from her Washington life with her husband, commentator Ben Domenech, and daughter Liberty when the show returned to its New York studio.\n\nShe was more forthcoming in her book.\n\n\"I had been unhappy at 'The View' for a long time,\" she wrote. \"My unhappiness was like this giant wave that had been building and building and finally crested after I returned from leave.\"\n\nThe outspoken McCain had been the show's lightning rod since joining, and also helped \"The View\" reach a new level of popularity and influence. It is currently trying out potential successors.\n\nDuring the Jan. 5 show, McCain interrupted Behar to say \"are you kidding me?\" when her colleague said the Republican Party is in more trouble than the Democrats. Behar was clearly angered, saying, \"excuse me, am I done? I'm not done.\"\n\nMcCain pressed on with her response, and Behar referenced the interruption again when she was finished.\n\n\"You missed me so much, Joy,\" McCain replied. \"You missed me so much when I was on maternity leave ... You missed fighting with me.\"\n\nBehar replied: \"I did not. I did not miss you. Zero.\"\n\nHost Whoopi Goldberg quickly moved in to shut things down, but McCain was heard saying, \"that's so nasty. I was teasing because you said something rude. That was so rude.\"\n\nIn her book, McCain said she burst into tears during a commercial break. At the end of the show, she began crying again and vomited, she wrote.\n\n\"It is one of the most singular feelings of loneliness and anguish I have felt in my entire life,\" McCain wrote. \"It was a perfect storm of hormones, postpartum anxiety and a lot of demons on 'The View' coming out to bite me.\"\n\nMcCain said she had asked the show's producers for an apology from Behar but was told none would be forthcoming.\n\nA spokeswoman for \"The View\" said Tuesday that Behar had no plans to comment.\n\nThe show issued this statement on McCain's book: \"For 25 years, The View has been a platform on air and behind the scenes for strong women. Live television and different perspectives can often lead to surprising moments, but the team is collaborative and supportive - focused on delivering an informative daily talk show to our loyal viewers.\"\n\nMcCain said that despite their political battles, she felt she and Behar had a mutual understanding and respect. But she wrote that they didn't speak again offstage after that incident.\n\nWhen McCain announced on the air July 1 that she would soon be leaving, Behar said, \"I have really, really appreciated the fact that you were a formidable opponent in many ways and that you spoke your mind. You're no snowflake, missy.\"\n\n\"The View\" has been filled with backstage drama ever since its invention by Barbara Walters in the mid-1990s. In her book, McCain talks about how wearing it was when stories about what happened off-air were leaked to the press.\n\nShe wrote that the show had a \"toxic\" atmosphere and that \"working at 'The View' brings out the worst in people.\"\n\nMcCain is the daughter of the late U.S. Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

Yes, like Rosie or Debbie before her - well, actually, no, they got fired, so like Meredith before her, Joy is choosing to walk away from Barbara and the gang, because almost two decades of doing that mess is about almost two decades too many. Behar says she'd like to get back to stand-up and that she's written a play, and maybe she'll host her own talk show somewhere. (Yeah, she's got that thing on Current, but that does not count, and Al Jazeera's taking that over anyway.) Really, though, I suspect she's just going to be watching this on repeat, wondering where the years went. That's what I'd be doing if I was Joy Behar, anyway. [ Deadline ]\n\nMaybe Joy could go on vacation with some girlfriends, just like Cameron, Drew, and Reese. It seems that the actresses Diaz, Barrymore, and Witherspoon have taken to Mexico together, enjoying the beaches of Tulum and probably drinking some margaritas on the sly. Witherspoon and Barrymore have both given birth in the last year, so they were enjoying some free time away from the screaming babies, while Diaz was just like, \"Whatever, I don't know, Justin's married to some girl now, so I'm free.\" Meanwhile Lucy Liu saw the photos on Instagram and wondered why she wasn't invited. Then she looked up from her phone and gazed out at the set of Elementary and remembered why. [ Us Weekly ]\n\nSo there's this kid named Lil Twist, he makes music of a sort, and he is friends with one Justinius Drewus Bieberus, the biggest kid star there is today. While Bieber is away risking his precious life to give English girls the shivers, Lil Twist is driving around Los Angeles in Justin's car. And crashing it. Yes, TMZ is telling us that Lil Twist crashed Justin's Fisker automobile - that's an expensive kind of electric car that sort of looks like a shiny prophylactic - into some poles outside a liquor store. Oh, for heaven's sake, Lil Twist. What's worse is that he LEFT THE CAR THERE. Yes, a BMW zoomed up shortly after the incident, someone said \"Get all the pieces from the car [that fell] and put it in the car,\" and they drove off. Oh, and get this! A source tells TMZ that one of the BMW passengers was Chris Brown!! Hahaha, what is this, It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World ?? And the hits don't stop coming: This is the third time Lil Twist has had an incident with one of Bieber's cars. He bottomed out a Ferrari in a parking lot a little while back, and then got pulled over while driving one of Justin's cars. That was the traffic incident where a photographer was killed while taking photos of the pull-over. That's not Lil Twist's fault of course, but good grief, Justin Bieber! I think it's maybe time you told your friend Lil Twist that he is not allowed to drive your cars. Or like give him the '03 Accord or something. There's gotta be a junker lying around. Let him drive the old Mercury Topaz and keep the expensive cars locked up. Because this Lil Twist? I'm just not sure he's a very good driver. For heaven's sake. [ TMZ ]\n\nDuchess Kate of Cambridge, future Queen of England and ruler of the Elvish Realm (I mean, I'm assuming; if anyone's going to rule the elves it's going to be the British, right?), was spotted in London recently shopping for maternity clothes. Yes, because Katherine is with child; growing in her womb right now is a future King or Queen of New Britain, the colony on the remote and cold Faroe Islands that the survivors of old Britain will be forced to found after all the floods and wars come. The kid is being born into an uncertain future, is what I'm saying. Anyway, Kate was at a department store looking at maternity dresses, one of which was modestly priced at about $55. Seriously! That's all. Of course most of Kate's clothing is woven by mystical druids on top of Ben Nevis and is therefore priceless, but sometimes she can buy a $55 dress and the world doesn't spin off its axis. Good for her. She really is one of the people. [ People ]\n\nDemi Moore is asking for alimony in her divorce from Ashton Kutcher, even though she most definitely won't get it. Apparently she has more money than him! Look at her, saving that Striptease paycheck while Ashton blew all his camera money on jOBS . But she's asking for alimony anyway because it's some sort of power play that might get her a better settlement in the end. After all, he's the one who filed for divorce, so he's gonna have to pay. And really didn't they kind of make their money together, as a power couple, while they were married? Like, they made each other more famous together and thus everyone is owed monies earned. So give Demi some of that Valentine's Day / New Year's Eve money, Kutch. She's earned it. [ TMZ ]"

This is why every afternoon The Atlantic Wire highlights the day's video clips that truly earn your five minutes (or less) of attention.

As Google Doodle subjects go, Clokey is as worthy of the honor as anyone, and it's a sign of how much respect Google's animators have for him that they included not just Gumby, but also Prickle, Goo, and Pokey in the design.  [ YouTube via WebSonic.nl ]\n\nWill Arnett's appearance on Conan last night eschewed the requisite vague talk about the Arrested Development movie for good-natured joshing about redheads, including a joke with the punchline \"taking people to the desert and shooting them.\" Also there was a deliberately terrible ad for O'Brien's show produced by Arnett and Jason Bateman's advertising agency. On the whole, it was a nice change of pace.[ TBS ]\n\nLast year, Sarah Palin and Barack Obama appeared in two issues of the Archie comics series.

      "text": "The 'View' Walk Off: Was Whoopi Goldberg Right?\n\nMusing on O'Reilly and Goldberg's fiery exchange\n\nPolitical blogs and morning TV shows are having a field day with Bill O'Reilly's explosive appearance on \"The View\" Thursday. As Wire readers know, co-hosts Whoopi Goldberg and Joy Behar stormed off the set after a heated debate about the proposed Islamic cultural center in lower Manhattan. O'Reilly said most Americans oppose the center because \"Muslims killed us on 9/11.\" To which Goldberg replied \"Oh my God! That is such bullshit!\" incensed that O'Reilly didn't distinguish between a small number of extremists and an entire religion. She and Behar walked off the set.\n\nIt was vintage \"The View.\" Heavy on the emotional theatrics, light on constructive dialogue. In other words: great television. Later Thursday night, O'Reilly clarified his remarks on his show, saying that he didn't mean to conflate Islam with terrorism but that \"after ten years\" Americans understand the difference between \"peace-abiding Muslims and people who make war under the banner of Islam.\" In essence, Goldberg's point that he say \"Muslim extremists\" instead of \"Muslims\" was moot. Nobody says \"Japanese extremists attacked us\" during World War II, O'Reilly noted:\n\nGlenn Davis at Mediate is less supportive. \"Remembering that our treatment of Japanese people during World War II involved this , this might not be the best analogy,\" she says, linking to information on Japanese interment camps. \"We still say, however, that even though Behar and Goldberg returned later, walking off the set during a debate made O'Reilly look like the winner...and the segment on his own show a victory lap.\" Meanwhile, MSNBC's Dylan Ratigan gave a stirring rebuttal to O'Reilly on \"Morning Joe\" Friday. He contends that the distinction between Muslims and Muslim extremists is crucial because the American people, by and large, haven't gotten the message:\n\nWhat do you think?"

      "text": "Chris Christie Is a Bully, Now and Forever\n\nChris Christie's long and deliberate effort to be seen as a moderate, bring-'em-together politician is gone. He is now and will forever be known as a bully, and if he wants to run in 2016, he might as well start working it into campaign ads.\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's long and deliberate effort to be seen as a moderate, bring-'em-together politician is one hundred percent gone. He is now and will forever be known as a bully, and if he wants to run in 2016, he might as well start working it into campaign ads.\n\nEarlier this month, New Jersey political types gathered for a roast of former Gov. Brendan Byrne. But it was the man that currently holds the seat that ended up taking much of the heat from the evening's presenters, as The New Yorker 's Ryan Lizza indicates in a lengthy new report on Christie's path to the governorship. Lizza describes an interaction between comedian Joy Behar and Christie, video of which he posted on Tuesday.\n\nWhat's interesting in that anecdote isn't Behar's accusation of bullying. It's Lizza's portrayal of the audience's laughter. Lizza was in the room, so he has a better sense of the audience's reaction. But in the video clip, the laughter doesn't appear to be awkward - it seems authentic. If it was authentic, then Lizza is seeing bullying even where none exists. And that's the future Christie faces.\n\nAfter Christie traveled to Las Vegas two weekends ago in an effort to earn the support of the Republican Jewish Coalition, a little-noticed story emerged from his now-famous apology for referring to the West Bank and Gaza Strip as \"occupied territories.\" Fortune contributor Richard Miniter describes an encounter between Morton Klein, president of Zionist Organization of America, and Christie after the comments. Klein confronted Christie after the speech, asking him not to use the term in the future. Christie responded dismissively, with a tone that \"radiated anger and impatience,\" Klein told Miniter. \"Christie 'didn't want to listen,' Klein said. 'He was really unpleasant, condescending, rude, dismissive. He was bullying me. I've never had a politician speak to me that way.'\"\n\nLizza's article has other examples of how readily people now critique Christie's persona. According to former governor and one-time Christie ally Thomas Kean, Christie has \"a way of distancing allies,\" Lizza writes, \"and he and Kean have had a falling out\" since Kean introduced him on election night last year. Now, Kean readily presents a different Christie than the one that accepted that impressive victory. \"He makes you feel that your life's going to be very unhappy if you don't do what he says,\" Kean now says about Christie.\n\nEven last year, calling Christie a bully didn't have as much resonance. Christie's opponent in his reelection, Barbara Buono, created - but never ran - the ad below, in which she explicitly calls him a bully. The campaign pulled the ad in part because the public perception of Christie as a tough guy was seen at the time as a positive.\n\nIf Christie decides to run for office in 2016, that persona will be unavoidable. Christie's Republican opponents will not hesitate in the way that Buono did, because the label has stuck. No matter what he does, he will be seen as being aggressive and challenging, regardless of how aggressive or challenging he's actually being.\n\nLizza posted another bit of ephemera from his reporting on the Christie story, a note sent to Christie by the granddaughter of a state senator. In one of his many public intemperate moments, Christie demanded that the New Jersey press for once \"take the bat out\" on Loretta Weinberg, a 79-old politician. The note, below, asks Christie to \"stop [bullying] [everybody].\"\n\nHere's the note Sen. Loretta Weinberg's granddaughter wrote after Christie asked press to \"take the bat out on\" LW. pic.twitter.com/rkeIuk2UVe\n\nAt this point, he might. But it won't change the public perception one bit."

      "text": "The Stimulus Worked.  So What? Who Cares?\n\nNot to get all Joy Behar on everyone, but the way the media covers the \"battle\" over whether the economic stimulus package worked is unsound. The stimulus packaged did what it was originally intended to do: it injected hundreds of billions of dollars worth of demand into an economy that was teetering on the brink of collapse. It did so slowly by our modern newscycle standards but incredibly rapidly by the standards of Washington. Moving so quickly, it acquired an inevitable trail of flotsam and jetsam; some waste here, some seeming boondoggles there.\n\nBy and large, though, and to a remarkable degree, the money went where it was intended to go. Unlike TARP, it didn't go to Wall Street. No bailouts here. Main Street got funding.\n\nIt is also absolutely the case that the stimulus is not terribly popular, and I don't particularly sympathize with Democrats who think this is unfair. Democrats oversold the stimulus as a panacea -- some did, anyway -- and they underestimated how precarious the economy was, which means that the base point for expectations should have been set much lower than it was. People are focused on the debt and the deficit because no Democrat is willing to make the case that deficit spending would lift the country out of an economic recession. In the space created by the lack of an intellectually honest affirmative case, the overselling of the original point and the party's general, perpetual message confusion, the stimulus became .. not so popular. Granted, if you asked people whether they like their particular project -- be it a roadway or a community center -- and you asked Republican politicians to disown projects whose ribbons they cut -- you'll get different and confusing answers.\n\nConsider the analogy: Republicans give President Bush and Vice President Cheney for preventing major post 9/11 terror attacks but don't give Democrats credit for preventing a prolonged recession.  There are some problems with this analogy -- one being that the recession Democrats inherited was unusually harmful and pre-recession employment will take its time returning.\n\nReporters shouldn't cover this question as if the effectiveness of the stimulus is the issue. It's just not."

Just not yet.\n\nElisabeth Hasselbeck was leaving The View , but then she wasn't, and now she's leaving again. We don't really know who to believe, but word is out - again - that the ice queen of daytime talk TV is getting the boot from Barbara Walters' daily gabfest. Just not yet.\n\nOver the weekend, the New York Post 's Page Six reported Hasselbeck will still leave The View before her \"long term contract\" is up - despite the very public denial from Walters early last week. According to the Post report, ABC is \"desperate to freshen\" The View , and getting rid of Joy Behar and Hasselbeck was seen as the best way to do it. Behar got to announce her exit on her own, but \"some enemies\" of Hasselbeck's leaked her departure to the press. Walters was up in arms and called the whole thing off. \"Barbara was spitting mad that it got mishandled, and called off the firing over [last] weekend,\" an anonymous source told the Post . The door is still open for an early exit, the source said, and that appears to be true.\n\nUs Weekly is now reporting ABC and Walters were trying to \"save face\" by calling off Hasselbeck's departure. Hasselbeck will still \"announce she is leaving on her own when she is ready,\" according to their source. So, really, ABC was trying to avoid Elisabeth Hasselbeck becoming their version of Ann Curry . No one wins there. It should be noted that Us wasn't the only outlet reporting Hasselbeck's firing, but they were the first. So maybe we should take their latest report with a grain of salt, if we're dealing with \"enemies\" leaking reports. Hasselbeck was getting canned because viewers found her \"too extreme and right wing,\" they reported .\n\nIn the meantime, Behar's chair still needs to be filled. ShowBiz 411 reported Brooke Shields was the favorite, while the Post says Christie Brinkley and Ali Wentworth are jockeying for position. The second seat just won't be open until Elisabeth Hasselbeck is ready."

      "text": "Joy Behar Blames 'The View' Technical Difficulties on Trump\n\nEntertainment Reporter\n\nJoy Behar is seeing Trump everywhere, including in connection with The View 's wonky teleprompter on Wednesday.\n\nThe co-hosts had just closed out its first Hot Topics segment, which ended with a heated exchange between Sunny Hostin and Alyssa Farah Griffin . The argument-over the benefits of school choice for low-income children-had gotten so contentious that \"no one can hear anything that's being said,\" moderator Whoopi Goldberg , shouted, before forcing herself in between the two hosts to call for a commercial break.\n\nTo make matters worse, at the top of the show, Goldberg turned to the camera to do her opening remarks, but there were no words on the teleprompter. When the show returned after the break, Goldberg tried to address the \"messy\" first segment.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"We're all here at the table and we're having a conversation ,\" she said sarcastically, \"and we're gonna go back to it-but before we do, I just wanna say, this is the beauty of people who have different opinions. Sometimes it's messy. Sometimes we're messy.\"\n\nShe continued, \"And I don't know if you noticed that when I came out this morning, I had trouble trying to figure out-'cause there was nothing in the [teleprompter]. There's something in the air.\"\n\nThat's when Behar jumped in with an explanation: \"You know what's in the air, Whoopi? Trumpism!\"\n\n\"We lost the election,\" Behar explained, as co-host Sarah Haines covered her face with her hands the way one might do when an older relative goes off on an embarrassing rant at Thanksgiving dinner.\n\nA few members of the audience laughed, though it was mostly awkward silence as Behar took the conversation in Trump's direction. \"Wait a minute,\" she said as the room reacted and Goldberg stared at the camera, mouth agape at the random topic change. \"Half of this country is miserable. And let's just tell the truth. We hate that he won. We hate it.\"\n\nAs for why the cast couldn't seem to get through a segment without an argument, Behar offered, \"Everybody's uptight and crazy right now.\"\n\nEntertainment Reporter\n\neboni.boykin-patterson@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin made his first public statements on the situation at the Ukraine-Russia border in over a month Tuesday, accusing the U.S. and its allies of ratcheting up tensions and ignoring Russian security demands, including halting NATO's expansion to Ukraine and other former Soviet countries.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin : \"I believe that the U.S., for example, does not care much about Ukraine's safety, though they probably give it a thought in the background. But their main task is to contain Russia's development. That is the problem. In this context, Ukraine is just a tool to reach this goal.\"\n\nPutin also accused the U.S. of withdrawing from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and deploying military equipment to Eastern European nations. He said, however, he is open to more talks to ease the ongoing tensions. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov spoke by phone again Tuesday. Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson traveled to Kyiv, where he held a news conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Johnson vowed to increase military aid and help defend Ukraine against any potential Russian aggression.\n\nBoris Johnson's visit to Ukraine came as he faced increasing pressure back home. On Monday, a highly anticipated report was published which found Downing Street parties for government officials during the U.K.'s pandemic lockdown represented a \"serious failure\" as millions of Britons canceled plans and stayed home to help limit the spread of COVID -19.\n\nTonga went into lockdown today after recording its first locally transmitted COVID cases since the start of the pandemic. The first cases were identified among port workers who were helping unload international aid shipments in the aftermath of last month's devastating volcanic eruption and tsunami. Other small Pacific nations have also recently reported their first outbreaks, including Samoa, Solomon Islands, Kiribati and Palau.\n\nSouth Africa has announced it will no longer require asymptomatic COVID cases to self-isolate and reduced the isolation period for symptomatic COVID cases to one week. Officials also loosened restrictions on in-person schooling. South African lawmakers say the recent changes were made as the nation exits its fourth wave of the pandemic, spurred by the Omicron variant, and thanks to the high level of immunity in the population.\n\nA number of European countries are also relaxing COVID curbs, with Denmark becoming the first EU country to lift all restrictions, despite a rise in cases. The World Health Organization, meanwhile, is warning countries against a hasty end to public health measures aimed at curbing transmission.\n\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus : \"We are concerned that a narrative has taken hold in some countries that because of vaccines and because of Omicron's high transmissibility and lower severity, preventing transmission is no longer possible and no longer necessary. Nothing could be further from the truth. More transmission means more deaths.\"\n\nSeparately, the WHO warned Tuesday that massive amounts of medical waste linked to the pandemic pose a threat to human health and the environment. The U.N. agency called for more biodegradable and sustainable materials and packaging for essential medical and personal protective equipment.\n\nThe president of Guinea-Bissau said he survived an attempted coup but that \"many\" members of his security forces died as gunmen tried to kill him and Cabinet members at the government palace. Local media reported at least six deaths linked to the attack. President Umaro Cissoko Embaló, a former army general, said the attack was linked to drug trafficking, though details remain unclear for now. Embaló took office in February 2020 after a contested election. Guinea-Bissau has endured a series of military coups and attempted military takeovers since gaining independence from Portugal in 1974. Tuesday's attack was the latest in a string of coups or attempted coups in West Africa. The U.N. secretary-general decried mounting instability in the region Tuesday.\n\nSecretary-General António Guterres : \"We are seeing a terrible multiplication of coups. And our strong appeal is for soldiers to go back to the barracks and for the constitutional order to be fully in place in the democratic context of today's Guinea-Bissau.\"\n\nMeanwhile, on Monday, the African Union suspended Burkina Faso following last week's military coup which deposed President Roch Kaboré.\n\nIn Syria, two babies died in the freezing cold at a camp for displaced people in Idlib province. Aid groups report at least one other baby and child died in the past few weeks as a result of the harsh winter weather. Some 2.8 million people are living in temporary shelters amid the decade-long war. The U.N. says the tragic humanitarian situation in Syria is being further exacerbated by a worsening economy, that has seen food prices double in a year, and a shortage in aid funding.\n\nAttorneys general from a dozen states and the District of Columbia have joined with over 25 district attorneys across the country, as well as gun violence prevention groups, in support of the Mexican government's historic lawsuit against U.S. gun manufacturers. The suit was first filed last August, seeking to hold 10 U.S.-based firearms companies accountable for Mexico's epidemic of gun violence. This is the first time U.S. gunmakers have been sued by a foreign government. In response to the growing support, Alejandro Celorio Alcántara, principal legal adviser for Mexico's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said in a statement, \"We are confirming that the missing link in this whole equation of illicit trafficking is the gun companies. And I think that's recognized on both sides of the border.\"\n\nHundreds of Native American tribes have reached a tentative $590 million settlement with Johnson & Johnson and the three largest U.S. drug distributors over their role in fueling an opioid epidemic that has devastated Indigenous communities. Most of that money would be used for substance use treatment and prevention efforts overseen by tribal health experts. J&J did not admit wrongdoing as part of the settlement. Native Americans have endured the highest per capita rate of opioid overdose.\n\nABC has suspended Whoopi Goldberg from \"The View\" for two weeks after facing widespread backlash over remarks she made on the show Monday claiming the Holocaust was \"not about race.\" The comments came during a discussion about a Tennessee school district's decision to ban the book \"Maus\" by acclaimed author Art Spiegelman, whose parents survived the Holocaust.\n\nWhoopi Goldberg : \"The Holocaust isn't about race.\"\n\nSara Haines : \"No.\"\n\nWhoopi Goldberg : \"No, it's not about race.\"\n\n[crosstalk]\n\nJoy Behar : \"They considered Jews a different race.\"\n\nWhoopi Goldberg : \"But it's not about race. It's not about race.\"\n\nJoy Behar : \"What is it about?\"\n\nWhoopi Goldberg : \"Because you - it's about man's inhumanity to man.\"\n\nGoldberg apologized on social media Monday. She also addressed her comments during Tuesday's airing of \"The View,\" where she said, \"my words upset so many people, which was never my intention. I understand why now, and for that I am deeply, deeply grateful because the information I got ... helped me understand some different things.\"\n\nAt least 14 historically Black colleges and universities reported bomb threats Tuesday - the first day of Black History Month - forcing them to lock down or cancel classes. At least half a dozen schools, including Howard University, also received threats on Monday and in previous weeks. No explosive devices were found on the affected campuses. Professor and award-winning author Ibram X. Kendi tweeted, \"I am a product of a HBCU , where I learned how to think and write and be me. ... Our HBCU family is resilient. But we shouldn't have to be.\"\n\nTwo fatal school shootings took place Tuesday. In Virginia, two campus police officers were shot dead at Bridgewater College, near Harrisonburg. A 27-year-old suspect was taken into custody. In Minnesota, a shooting outside the South Education Center in Richfield killed one student and left another in critical condition. Two suspects have been arrested.\n\nIn California, students at an Oakland middle school led a walkout Tuesday, protesting the Oakland Unified School District's proposal to close and merge over a dozen schools. Parents, teachers and school staff also joined the action. And at least two teachers have gone on hunger strike in response. The Oakland school district has cited low enrollment at the schools and budget deficits.\n\nIn the nation's capital, the D.C. City Council voted unanimously to redirect tax revenue from the area's wealthiest residents to daycare workers. Thousands of caregivers are expected to receive checks for at least $10,000. Councilmembers hope to establish a program to subsidize daycare workers' paychecks in future years in order to compensate for their chronic underpayment.\n\nIn New York, immigrant rights groups and progressive lawmakers are pushing forward a bill that would expand state-funded healthcare coverage for low-income New Yorkers regardless of immigration status. The bill, known as #Coverage4All, has advanced through two key health committees over the past week. The New York Immigration Coalition and other advocates are calling on Governor Hochul and the New York Legislature to include the bill in the state budget.\n\nNew York Immigration Coalition ad : \"Immigrant workers have been on the frontlines fighting COVID . Without essential workers harvesting crops, delivering food, keeping grocery stores open and caring for our seniors, we couldn't have gotten through it. But instead of fairly rewarding their sacrifices, thousands of immigrants died due to lack of health coverage. Our COVID comeback can't be complete if essential New Yorkers are left behind just because of their immigration status. We need coverage for all.\""

William Barber talks about the Poor People's Campaign, the Republican Party's embrace of President Trump's racist policies, threats to voting rights and the GOP's remaking of the federal courts. Rev. William Barber is president of Repairers of the Breach and the author of \"Third Reconstruction: Moral Mondays, Fusion Politics, and the Rise of a New Justice Movement.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I'm Amy Goodman. As the nation prepares to honor Martin Luther King on Dr. Martin Luther King Day, on Monday, modern day civil rights leaders have launched a new Poor People's Campaign, inspired by King's historic 1968 action, led by King and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. We're speaking to the Reverend Dr. William Barber of Repairers of the Breach and evangelical minister Jonathan Wilson-Hartgrove, who once was a page for Strom Thurmond. Now, the man who replaced Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina is Republican Senator Lindsey Graham. This is what Lindsey Graham had to say when he appeared on ABC's The View on Monday.\n\nSEN . LINDSEY GRAHAM : He beat me like a drum. He ran against 17 Republicans and crushed us all. He ran against the Clinton machine and won.\n\nJOY BEHAR : Yeah.\n\nSEN . LINDSEY GRAHAM : So, all I can say is, you can say anything you want to say about the guy. I said he was a xenophobic, race-baiting, religious bigot. I ran out of things to say. He won. Guess what. He's our president.\n\nJOY BEHAR : You're calling him xenophobic, religious bigot?\n\nMEGHAN McCAIN: He did.\n\nSEN . LINDSEY GRAHAM : I did that during the campaign.\n\nJOY BEHAR : Yeah, you did.\n\nANA NAVARRO : Has he done anything to change?\n\nMEGHAN McCAIN: By the way, I think-\n\nSEN . LINDSEY GRAHAM : Yeah.\n\nANA NAVARRO : Is he still all those things?\n\nSEN . LINDSEY GRAHAM : In my view, he is my president, and he's doing a really good job.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Ah, very interesting, what Senator Lindsey Graham had to say. We're joined again by Dr. William Barber and minister Jonathan Wilson-Hartgrove. Your thoughts?\n\nBISHOP WILLIAM BARBER II: Yeah. And I'm sitting here thinking-I want to just mention first, Reverend Dr. Liz Theoharis, who's the co-chair of the Poor People's Campaign, she's probably looking at that and, like me, saying, \"What in the world?\" So, you say that's during the campaign, and you laugh about it. And now the person is in office, and you say they're doing a good job. And they've neither repented in word or in deed. And, in fact, their policies are fine, and you're supporting the policies.\n\nSo here's the question: If you're supporting the policies of a racist xenophobe, what does that make you? And that's why we have to have a policy focus. Remember, it was Lindsey Graham, I believe, and others who came out quickly-Tim Scott-against what happened in Charlottesville. And most politicians will be shrewd enough to do that. That doesn't mean they aren't white supremacists and white nationalists. The question is: Mr. Graham, Mr. Scott, who is black-because you can be black and be a white supremacist. At least you can be one who encourages it. And I think you can be, in politics. Where do you stand on restoring the Voting Rights Act? You've had four years to do that. You do know that undermining the Voting Rights Act is white nationalism, white supremacy. Where do you stand on healthcare? Because you do know that when you cut healthcare, you hurt a large percentage of African Americans, particularly in your state. Where do you stand on living wages, since 52 percent of African Americans make less than a living wage, and there's 64 million people that make less than a living wage in this country, less than $15 an hour? Where do you stand on immigration reform? Because, you know, Richard Spencer declares that immigration is the first battle of white supremacists and white nationalists in the modern era. That's what he has actually said.\n\nSo, the question becomes not are you loud like Trump, and are you-do you carry on the antics of Trump. It's the policies. It's the policies of white nationalism and white supremacy. And with Mr. Graham, where do you stand on appointing Jeff Sessions, who has a history of standing against voting rights and trying to prosecute people fighting for voting rights? Where do you stand? Your committee, Mr. Graham, the committee you're on, allowed Thomas Farr to come through, out of North Carolina, to be-to almost make it to the federal bench, who is a known Nazi sympathizer and also a white supremacist, who carried the work of Jesse Helms and who has been behind every voter suppression act in North Carolina.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, talk about Thomas Alvin Farr.\n\nBISHOP WILLIAM BARBER II: Yeah, well, sure.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You also wrote about him in your New York Times op-ed piece , one of Trump's, what you called, worrisome nominees to the judiciary.\n\nBISHOP WILLIAM BARBER II: Well, and I want to step back from Trump, because I'm trying to work on that-I think we're too Trumpy. So, yes, in the article, I did say Trump, but I also pointed out-and some people missed this-Thomas Farr would have never gotten to the judiciary if it wasn't for Senator Richard Burr and Senator Tillis from our state-by the way, Senator Tillis was the architect of the voter suppression when he was speaker of the House-who denied two black women, a former Supreme Court justice in North Carolina and a federal prosecutor in North Carolina-they denied them even getting a hearing. They didn't even allow them to get a hearing. And then, once Trump gets in, they push forward Farr's name.\n\nSo we can't just lay this reality of what we're seeing at the feet of Trump. Trump is a symptom of a deeper moral malady. And if he was gone tomorrow or impeached tomorrow, the senators and the House of Representatives and Ryan and McConnell and Graham and all them would still be there. And what we have found, Amy, when we look at them, no matter how crazy they call him or names they call him or anger they get with him, it's all a front, because at the end of the day, they might disagree with his antics, but they support his agenda.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I wanted to turn to something that happened that might have surprised a number of people last week, and that was President Trump abruptly shutting down the Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, after it failed to prove any-after it failed to provide any evidence of voter fraud. The commission's chair, Kris Kobach, blamed a, quote, \"barrage of meritless lawsuits\" for the investigation's closure, after most U.S. states and the District of Columbia refused to share data with the commission. Can you talk about the-I mean, is this a victory?\n\nBISHOP WILLIAM BARBER II: No, no. Well, no. It is, and it isn't. And it shouldn't-the claim of fraud is fraudulent in itself. I mean, the first thing that the Trump administration did, with Jeff Sessions, is pull out supporting a case out of North Carolina that the Supreme Court unanimously said was surgical racism. Now think about that. The first thing his AG appointee does is say, \"I'm no longer going to protect voting rights.\" So he's turned the attorney general's office away from protecting voting rights. Then we have this fraudulent-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We have 60 seconds.\n\nBISHOP WILLIAM BARBER II: OK. We have this fraudulent committee, and they now shut it down, but it's done its job. They are playing to a certain base. They have sown the theory of voter fraud, and now they're saying they couldn't prove it because the lawsuits blocked them. It's all a game, and we have to unpack it. And we need a movement to do that.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And so, how are you moving that movement forward, Minister Hartgrove?\n\nJONATHAN WILSON - HARTGROVE : I think what's really important with this Poor People's Campaign is that it's local groups all over the country who are coming together, people who are impacted by these issues realizing that the folks in Washington are not serving them. And so, what we can learn from Dr. King and from that whole movement 50 years ago is that a diverse fusion coalition of people coming together and insisting on changing the priorities is what changes the country. We can't look for moral leadership from Washington. We've got to get it from the ground.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And the first action? Ten seconds.\n\nBISHOP WILLIAM BARBER II: First action will be on the Monday after Mother's Day. We're going after 25,000 people engaging in civil disobedience over six weeks, to launch a movement. I want to say that: to launch the movement, not end the movement. We'll come back and talk more about it in days to come.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Reverend Dr. William Barber of Repairers of the Breach and evangelical minister Jonathan Wilson-Hartgrove, School for Conversion in North Carolina, organizing a new Poor People's campaign.\n\nAnd that does it for our show.

But Klobuchar is also facing mounting scrutiny over her record as a district attorney in Minnesota. The Minneapolis NAACP , Black Lives Matter Twin Cities and other racial justice groups recently called on Klobuchar to suspend her presidential campaign following a shocking investigation by the Associated Press. The AP report centered on the case of Myon Burrell, an African-American teenager who was sentenced to life in prison over the 2002 murder of 11-year-old Tyesha Edwards. Klobuchar led the case against Myon Burrell when she was Hennepin County's district attorney, but the AP report says she may have mishandled the case and that Burrell could be innocent. The Associated Press report shows how prosecutors had no DNA or fingerprints tying Burrell to the murder and that they relied on jailhouse informants, some of whom have since recanted their testimonies. Burrell has always maintained his innocence. On the campaign trail, Klobuchar has cited the jailing of Burrell as one of her achievements and brought up the conviction during a debate in September. We speak with Nekima Levy Armstrong, civil rights attorney, activist, head of the Racial Justice Network and former president of the Minneapolis chapter of the NAACP . \"It's shocking at this point that Amy Klobuchar is still in the race for president of the United States, given the significance of Myon Burrell's case,\" she says.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now!

She brought up the case during a debate in September.\n\nSEN . AMY KLOBUCHAR : We found the shooter, and we put him in jail. We did the same for the killer of a little girl named Tyesha Edwards, who was doing her homework at her kitchen table and was shot through the window.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : On Tuesday, Senator Klobuchar was grilled about the case by Sunny Hostin, co-host of The View .\n\nSUNNY HOSTIN : I've reviewed the facts of that case, and it is one of the most flawed investigations and prosecutions that I think I have ever seen. When you look at it, you have your homicide detective on tape offering informants 500 bucks apiece for names. When I looked at it, I also saw that Mr. Burrell's alibis were - alibi witnesses were not looked at. His surveillance tapes were not looked at. I mean, how do you defend something like that to someone like me, who is the mother of a black boy, a black teenager? This case would be my worst nightmare.\n\nSEN . AMY KLOBUCHAR : Well, Sunny, I'll start with this: I've been very clear, all of the evidence needs to be immediately reviewed in that case, the past evidence and also any new evidence that has come forward. I've called for that. ...\n\nSUNNY HOSTIN : Well, you're a U.S. senator now. You're a powerful woman.\n\nSEN . AMY KLOBUCHAR : Yes, yes.\n\nSUNNY HOSTIN : What do you intend to do to right this wrong?\n\nSEN . AMY KLOBUCHAR : Well, I've called for the office and the courts to review the evidence. That is what we must do in the justice system. I've also worked extensively with the Innocence Project in my previous job, and we reviewed all the serious cases we had that involved DNA evidence. This one didn't. But we involved - reviewed those cases. I pioneered a new -\n\nSUNNY HOSTIN : It had no gun, it had no DNA evidence, and it had no fingerprints.\n\nJOY BEHAR : Are we prosecuting Amy Klobuchar today?\n\nSEN . AMY KLOBUCHAR : Exactly. So, this is a case that must - It must be reviewed.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Sunny Hostin of The View questioning Democratic presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar on Tuesday.\n\nWe go now to Minneapolis, where we're joined by Nekima Levy Armstrong, civil rights attorney, activist, head of the Racial Justice Network, former president of the Minneapolis chapter of the NAACP .\n\nSo, if you can talk more about the significance of this case? Now, very clearly, Senator Klobuchar brought it up herself to show how, you know, her competence is putting people in jail who killed an 11-year-old child. Explain what you feel is wrong, and the significance of this AP investigation.\n\nNEKIMA LEVY ARMSTRONG : It's shocking at this point that Amy Klobuchar is still in the race for president of the United States, given the significance of Myon Burrell's case, the fact that he was merely a child himself at the time that he was brought into the criminal justice system. When he was first interrogated by police - eight hours, no attorney, his mother in the next room - he asked for his mother 13 times. And he was denied that opportunity to even consult with his mother. He has maintained his innocence from the beginning.\n\nAnd in spite of that information, Amy Klobuchar has exploited this case. She has exploited the tragic death of Tyesha Edwards, the 11-year-old child who was killed in this situation through an accidental shooting outside of her home. And she exploited Myon Burrell, using his name or using this case repeatedly throughout her career and to bolster her career. As a matter fact, when she ran for the Senate in 2006, she put forward a commercial that included Tyesha's mother and other victims of crime, demonstrating that she was tough on crime. I do not feel that she has any remorse for what she did to Myon and the impact upon his family and the community. And she is continuing to deflect away questions about her role in the unjust and wrongful conviction of Myon Burrell.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, you talk about Myon inside being interrogated as a 16-year-old. He repeatedly asked for his mother. His mother was just outside that room, demanding of the police that she be inside with her son, and they told her no. The day before he was indicted, and she was visiting him in jail, she was driving home, and her car went off the road. She hit a tree, it exploded, and she was killed?\n\nNEKIMA LEVY ARMSTRONG : Yes. Knowing that Myon did not get to even pay his mother respects at her funeral is something that still shocks me to this day -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : She did not allow -\n\nNEKIMA LEVY ARMSTRONG : - just the level of callousness and cruelty.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : She did not allow him?\n\nNEKIMA LEVY ARMSTRONG : No, Amy Klobuchar did not allow Myon Burrell to attend his mother's funeral, claiming that he was a threat to public safety. I have seen people who are incarcerated in prison be allowed to leave prison and go and pay their last respects to their family members at funerals, but Amy Klobuchar denied a child this opportunity.\n\nAgain, Myon Burrell has continued to maintain his innocence. The co-defendants in this case have come forward - in particular, the person who pulled the trigger, back several years ago, saying that Myon Burrell was innocent and taking responsibility for the crime. But his words have fallen upon deaf ears. And so Myon continues to pay the price, having been locked up for roughly 18 years for a crime that he did not commit.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Now, to be clear -\n\nNEKIMA LEVY ARMSTRONG : And -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : To be clear, he has been offered plea deals that would get him out now, and he has said, \"No, I won't plead guilty to a crime I didn't commit\"?\n\nNEKIMA LEVY ARMSTRONG : Absolutely. He is a strong man of faith, and he does not believe that he should have to plead guilty to a crime for which he did not commit. And he said that he's not only doing this for himself, he's also doing this for Tyesha.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, you are calling for - the NAACP , Black Lives Matter Twin Cities are calling for Amy Klobuchar to suspend her presidential campaign. Can you explain why?\n\nNEKIMA LEVY ARMSTRONG : Absolutely. I believe that Myon Burrell's case, coupled with Amy Klobuchar's predatory behavior as a prosecutor, should be disqualifying. We know that with the current president in office, there have been a lot of concerns surrounding his questionable conduct, his ethics, his rhetoric. We are seeing similarities in terms of the way that Amy Klobuchar conducted herself as a prosecutor and the way that she is responding to this case. Instead of accepting responsibility, acknowledging her mistakes and rolling up her sleeves to help set Myon free, she is continuing to sidestep these questions, absolve herself of responsibility and minimize the significance of sending an innocent black teenage boy to prison for life. That is simply unconscionable, and it is unacceptable. And those are not the qualities that we need to see in our next president of the United States.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Let me ask you about this BuzzFeed report . \"Klobuchar has also been criticized for failing to bring charges against a single police officer who killed a citizen in her eight-year run as the top prosecutor in Minnesota's most populous county. There were more than two dozen police-involved killings in that period.\" Nekima Levy Armstrong, can you weigh in here?\n\nNEKIMA LEVY ARMSTRONG : Absolutely. Amy Klobuchar received the endorsement of police unions when she ran her various campaigns. And as a result, she did not hold police officers accountable. She worked very closely with the Minneapolis Police Department, that has had a long history of corruption. As a matter of fact, about $4.8 million in lawsuits were settled against the Minneapolis Police Department in 122 police misconduct cases during the time period in which Amy Klobuchar was the Hennepin County attorney. And so she had a very close relationship with police.\n\nThe black community called her out consistently for not holding police officers accountable. As a matter fact, a shooting of a teenager happened in 2004, and that teenager's mother sent Amy Klobuchar a letter asking her to not use a grand jury and to charge the officers who killed her son. Amy Klobuchar did not even respond to that mother's letter. And this was an African-American woman simply demanding justice on behalf of her child.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Nekima Levy Armstrong, I want to thank you for being with us, civil rights attorney, activist, head of the Racial Justice Network, former president of the Minneapolis chapter of the NAACP .\n\nThat does it for our show.

Pelosi appeared on ABC's The View and suggested impeachment is off the table because there is no evidence President Bush has committed any criminal acts. We ask Rep. Dennis Kucinich for a response. Kucinich recently introduced a single article of impeachment against President Bush. The article accuses Bush of deceiving Congress to authorize the invasion of Iraq. [includes rush transcript]\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : We're talking about the use of public subsidies for sports stadiums. We're joined from Washington, D.C. by Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich. And here in New York, we have Bettina Damiani, the project director of Good Jobs New York, and Neil deMause, author of Field of Schemes: How the Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money into Private Profit . But, Congressman Kucinich, you've been leading the fight for impeachment, and I know you have to go very soon, so I wanted to ask you about an interview with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that aired on The View earlier this week. She was asked about impeachment. JOY BEHAR : You've ruled against impeaching George Bush and Dick Cheney, and now Kucinich is trying to pass that. Why do you insist on not impeaching these people, so that the world and America can really see the crimes that they've committed? REP . NANCY PELOSI : Well, I think that it - I think it was important, when I became Speaker - and it's, by the way, a very important position - President, Vice President, Speaker of the House - I saw it as my responsibility to try to bring a much divided country together to the extent that we could. I thought that impeachment would be divisive for the country. In terms of what we wanted - set out to do, we wanted to raise the minimum wage, give the biggest increase in veterans benefits to veterans in the seventy-seven-year history, then pass research for stem cell research, all of that. This week, we're going to pass equal pay for equal work. It has been a long time in coming - pay equity. We're going to pass legislations for product safety, for toys that children put in their - there's an agenda that you have to get done. You have to try to do it in a bipartisan way. The President has to sign it. If somebody had a crime that the President had committed, that would be a different story. JOY BEHAR : Can they still do it after he's out? BARBARA WALTERS : When we - when I interviewed you last year, you had just begun, and you were going to clean up the mess, remember? REP . NANCY PELOSI : And we did. BARBARA WALTERS : You look around this country, 75 percent of the country - forget George Bush - thinks that Congress is doing a lousy job. ELISABETH HASSELBECK : I think it's 91 percent now. REP . NANCY PELOSI : Well, I don't disagree with that, because largely it's predicated on ending the war in Iraq. That's the main question, and we were not successful. In our House of Representatives, I'm very proud of our members, because they voted overwhelmingly over and over again to bring the war to an end, bring the troops home safely and soon, sent it to the Senate, and it hits a dead end. But in terms of that particular standard, I would say I disapprove, as well. But we do - we passed some of the things I just mentioned, the energy bill. We worked in a bipartisan way, Innovation Agenda. We have to create jobs, expand healthcare, protect the American people and educate our children. And you can't do that if you're trying to impeach the President at the same time, unless you have the goods that this president committed crimes. JUAN GONZALEZ : That was House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Congressman Kucinich, your response to her take on the situation with impeachment? REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, now that I've heard that the Speaker is looking for evidence that crimes may have been committed, I certainly want to direct her attention to the thirty-five articles of impeachment that I presented, which assert quite directly that crimes have been committed, including taking this nation into a war, an illegal war, based on lies; including the deaths of over a million innocent Iraqis, which constitute a war crime; including wiretapping, rendition, torture, illegal detention. There are many examples of laws that have been broken. And the reason why the Judiciary Committee should hold a hearing on the impeachment itself is because there needs to be a public airing of this. So, I have a great deal of respect for Speaker Pelosi, and I think that since she made that statement on The View , there's an opportunity now for us to come forward and to lay all the facts out so that she can reconsider her decision not to permit the Judiciary Committee to proceed with a full impeachment hearing. I just want to state this, that I appreciate that she consented to a hearing on Friday. It was a six-hour hearing, over a dozen witnesses. Twenty-four members of Congress attended. It's being taken seriously. I think the idea that nothing can be done right now because we're on the eve of an election raises questions about our constitutional responsibility to be a check and balance to administration abuse of power. If in fact we're in a war that's based on lies, and we have thousands of troops whose lives are on the line every day, we owe it to them and we owe it to the American people to set straight the public record. And then, whether or not it results in the President being removed from office before the end of his term is another matter. I want to further say that with the possibility of a war in Iran in the offing, a war against Iran, a war that would be a result of a pre-emptive attack, much like the one that the United States launched against Iraq, it becomes very important that we hold this administration to the highest standard of having to verify the statements they make to take us into one war and to try to take us into another.

JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, Congressman Dennis Kucinich of Ohio, thank you, once again, for joining us.\n\nREP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, now that I've heard that the Speaker is looking for evidence that crimes may have been committed, I certainly want to direct her attention to the thirty-five articles of impeachment that I presented, which assert quite directly that crimes have been committed, including taking this nation into a war, an illegal war, based on lies; including the deaths of over a million innocent Iraqis, which constitute a war crime; including wiretapping, rendition, torture, illegal detention. There are many examples of laws that have been broken. And the reason why the Judiciary Committee should hold a hearing on the impeachment itself is because there needs to be a public airing of this. So, I have a great deal of respect for Speaker Pelosi, and I think that since she made that statement on The View , there's an opportunity now for us to come forward and to lay all the facts out so that she can reconsider her decision not to permit the Judiciary Committee to proceed with a full impeachment hearing. I just want to state this, that I appreciate that she consented to a hearing on Friday. It was a six-hour hearing, over a dozen witnesses. Twenty-four members of Congress attended. It's being taken seriously. I think the idea that nothing can be done right now because we're on the eve of an election raises questions about our constitutional responsibility to be a check and balance to administration abuse of power. If in fact we're in a war that's based on lies, and we have thousands of troops whose lives are on the line every day, we owe it to them and we owe it to the American people to set straight the public record. And then, whether or not it results in the President being removed from office before the end of his term is another matter. I want to further say that with the possibility of a war in Iran in the offing, a war against Iran, a war that would be a result of a pre-emptive attack, much like the one that the United States launched against Iraq, it becomes very important that we hold this administration to the highest standard of having to verify the statements they make to take us into one war and to try to take us into another.

[includes rush transcript]\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : A congressional subcommittee has launched a probe into the use of public financing to build sports complexes like the new Yankee Stadium. The Domestic Policy Subcommittee of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, chaired by Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich, will hold hearings this September on whether land for the new stadium in the Bronx was wildly inflated to justify nearly a billion dollars in tax-free bonds. Congressman Kucinich is looking into whether city officials overvalued the stadium site by several times its actual price. The Yankees would have avoided - or the bond-holders would have avoided millions in taxes, because they would be exempt from paying taxes on interest they earn. Meanwhile, the Yankees have requested an additional $336 million in tax-free bonds to help complete the stadium. In a letter sent earlier this month to Yankees president Randy Levine, New York Assemblyman Richard Brodsky noted that the tax-free interest earned on the stadium bonds \"normally would go into the city's coffers to pay for schools, police and health care.\" Today, we host a discussion on public subsidies for sports stadiums. Congressman Dennis Kucinich joins us from the Capitol Rotunda in Washington, D.C. I'm also joined here in the firehouse studio by two guests: Bettina Damiani is the project director of Good Jobs New York, and Neil deMause is a writer and the author of Field of Schemes: How the Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money into Private Profit . I'd like to begin with Congressman Kucinich. You have, as of last week, made a request to the City of New York and to the New York Yankees for a variety of documents as part of your continuing investigation into possible abuses of federal laws and IRS regulations relating to these kind of stadium projects. Could you tell us what you're trying to do with that investigation and why you decided to focus in on New York and the Yankees? REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, this is a project that's imminent, and we have - the thing that I think, you know, caught my attention is when you have an independent appraisal of the land that the Yankees want to get for their new stadium of $45 per square foot, and yet the city had an appraisal that appraised the same land at $275 a square foot. Now, what our committee is trying to find out is, does the city's assessment represent a deliberate inflation of the value of the land so that there would be a greater number of tax-free bonds issued, thereby raising questions of, you know, an inappropriate increased diversion of federal tax monies for this kind of private project. JUAN GONZALEZ : Now, you have been, for now several months, actually, questioning the IRS about the original waiver, in essence, that they gave the Yankees a few years ago and the New York Mets for the building of their hugely expensive stadiums. Could you tell our viewers and listeners what is the crux of the concern that you have with how the IRS is functioning? REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, in 1986, there was a change in the tax law which made it very clear that stadiums could not be using these tax-exempt bonds to construct these professional sports stadiums. The IRS had a ruling in a private letter that essentially gave the sports teams the ability to make payments in lieu of taxes, which was kind of a loophole that enabled them to get to the point of being able to participate in these tax-free financing schemes. And so, I've had a hearing where we talked to the IRS , asked them for an explanation. And from what I understand, as a result of our hearing, they're reviewing their policies to see whether or not the 1986 Tax Reform Act has actually been compromised by the decision that they made. I think that it's important to understand that we're not alleging, at this point, that there's been any kind of criminal activity. We're simply reviewing all the information that's been presented to us, so that we can determine, first of all, the discrepancies in the appraisals, secondly, the public policy issue of using tax-exempt bonds for these stadiums, and third, if there is an inflated value of this project, the implication that it has for security laws with respect to the issuance of the tremendous amount of bond financing. JUAN GONZALEZ : I'd like ask Bettina Damiani from Good Jobs New York, this whole issue of this thing called \"PILOTs,\" or payments in lieu of taxes, for use of repaying these tax-exempt bonds, is a very complicated issue that most the general public doesn't understand. Your organization has been in the forefront of questioning these kinds of development deals by New York, but also, by extension, by many municipalities around the country. Could you break down how these PILOTs work generally? BETTINA DAMIANI : Certainly. And it's not just the average New Yorker, as we learned through the Yankee Stadium project. Most New York City and New York State elected officials don't quite understand the issue of PILOTs, which is part of the crux of this issue. Essentially, PILOTs are payments in lieu of taxes. Instead of paying taxes, the Yankees are paying back their tax-free bonds. So, there's money that should be going into, as Assembly member Brodsky mentioned, the pot of money that would help pay for roads and schools and other services that New York City needs. Instead, it's just going - it's being completely diverted. And this, unfortunately, is a policy that is not done just with the Yankees but with a variety of other very large financial firms that have managed to make a special deal with New York City. JUAN GONZALEZ : And in this particular case, it was actually in the interest of the New York Yankees to have a very high assessment of their land, because that would allow them to be able to float more bonds and pay more PILOTs, which is their main goal here, is to raise as much money as possible to build their stadium, right? BETTINA DAMIANI : Exactly, and that's the irony. And that's one of the things that you mentioned in your article yesterday, is that in the South Bronx, the city was trying desperately to inflate the value of property, but not to benefit the larger community or the people that live in the neighborhood, but really for the sole benefit of the New York Yankees. JUAN GONZALEZ : And, Neil deMause, you've been writing now for quite a while about these stadium boondoggles. Virtually every major city in America is building a new arena or a new stadium of one kind, and most of them are using some degree or other of public financing. Could you give us a sense of the overall national picture? NEIL DEMAUSE : Sure. I mean, I think it's absolutely correct that every major and minor city is either building a stadium or arena or being asked to estimate somewhere around $2 billion a year of public money going into these buildings, a very, very small percentage of which comes back in terms of, you know, tax benefits or actually benefits to the cities. You know, when the Yankees and the Mets first announced their deals, Mayor Bloomberg said, \"Oh, you know, we don't make subsidies; we make investments, and we get our money back.\" At the time, it was announced, well, the Yankees and Mets are going to be paying for, you know, all the construction costs of the stadium. As you look at it and break down where they're getting tax breaks and where they're getting sort of hidden subsidies, the taxpayers wind up paying most of the cost. JUAN GONZALEZ : And, Congressman Kucinich, you originally had scheduled your hearing for this week but then decided to postpone it until September. Have you been in conversations with the City of New York and with the Yankees about them also testifying at your hearing? And what documents, specifically, are you trying to get from them now? REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, I could say that my subcommittee staff - and again, I'm the chair of the Domestic Policy Subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over this matter - and our subcommittee staff is in contact with officials of both the City of New York and the New York Yankees to discuss their potential appearance in front of our congressional subcommittee. I think that it's very important to understand that we're looking at a public policy matter here that relates not only to New York and not only to the Nets and the Atlantic Yard project, but it also relates to the whole country, as your other guests have said, because it's quite possible that there are billions of dollars in tax benefits that should be going to municipalities for the purposes of repairing their infrastructure and for schools and other things and that are instead being diverted for these private sports complexes. And the question is one of public policy, one of the IRS , and in the case of the New York Yankees, questions of securities law, because of the various amounts of the appraisal, $45 a square foot versus $275 a square foot, which have a bearing on the overall cost of the project. And if the cost of the project is inflated, that's going to be of interest to the SEC , as well as the IRS . JUAN GONZALEZ : And in terms of the - you're not, at this point, contemplating subpoenaing any records. You're figuring that they are going to be - they will provide you the documents and the information that you requested to avoid that potential. REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, you know, we generally assume that we'll get cooperation. I mean, certainly, as an investigative subcommittee, if we need to enforce that request with a subpoena, we have the ability to apply for that. But we're not at that point yet. And, you know, we're hopeful for cooperation on the part of all the parties involved. And I think that, again, this is a matter of serious public policy. When you have New York City, a great American city, which has all these capital infrastructure needs, and when payments get diverted, essentially - payments are not going into areas where the city expects the tax revenues will be coming from, and instead they're diverted in these payments in lieu of taxes, they're intensely serious matters that need to be discussed. And so, that's why the work that Mr. Brodsky is doing and your other guests are involved in is very significant. We're going to continue with our work on the Domestic Policy Subcommittee, and we'll be sure to keep you posted. JUAN GONZALEZ : OK. We're talking with Congressman Dennis Kucinich in Washington, and here also, Bettina Damiani of Good Jobs New York and Neil deMause, the author of Field of Schemes . We're going to return in a minute and to continue the conversation. And before Congressman Kucinich leaves, we also want to ask him about the hearings in Congress, the potential impeachment hearings. We'll be back in a minute. [break] JUAN GONZALEZ : We're talking about the use of public subsidies for sports stadiums. We're joined from Washington, D.C. by Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich. And here in New York, we have Bettina Damiani, the project director of Good Jobs New York, and Neil deMause, author of Field of Schemes: How the Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money into Private Profit . But, Congressman Kucinich, you've been leading the fight for impeachment, and I know you have to go very soon, so I wanted to ask you about an interview with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that aired on The View earlier this week. She was asked about impeachment. JOY BEHAR : You've ruled against impeaching George Bush and Dick Cheney, and now Kucinich is trying to pass that. Why do you insist on not impeaching these people, so that the world and America can really see the crimes that they've committed? REP . NANCY PELOSI : Well, I think that it - I think it was important, when I became Speaker - and it's, by the way, a very important position - President, Vice President, Speaker of the House - I saw it as my responsibility to try to bring a much divided country together to the extent that we could. I thought that impeachment would be divisive for the country. In terms of what we wanted - set out to do, we wanted to raise the minimum wage, give the biggest increase in veterans benefits to veterans in the seventy-seven-year history, then pass research for stem cell research, all of that. This week, we're going to pass equal pay for equal work. It has been a long time in coming - pay equity. We're going to pass legislations for product safety, for toys that children put in their - there's an agenda that you have to get done. You have to try to do it in a bipartisan way. The President has to sign it. If somebody had a crime that the President had committed, that would be a different story. JOY BEHAR : Can they still do it after he's out? BARBARA WALTERS : When we - when I interviewed you last year, you had just begun, and you were going to clean up the mess, remember? REP . NANCY PELOSI : And we did. BARBARA WALTERS : You look around this country, 75 percent of the country - forget George Bush - thinks that Congress is doing a lousy job. ELISABETH HASSELBECK : I think it's 91 percent now. REP . NANCY PELOSI : Well, I don't disagree with that, because largely it's predicated on ending the war in Iraq. That's the main question, and we were not successful. In our House of Representatives, I'm very proud of our members, because they voted overwhelmingly over and over again to bring the war to an end, bring the troops home safely and soon, sent it to the Senate, and it hits a dead end. But in terms of that particular standard, I would say I disapprove, as well. But we do - we passed some of the things I just mentioned, the energy bill. We worked in a bipartisan way, Innovation Agenda. We have to create jobs, expand healthcare, protect the American people and educate our children. And you can't do that if you're trying to impeach the President at the same time, unless you have the goods that this president committed crimes. JUAN GONZALEZ : That was House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Congressman Kucinich, your response to her take on the situation with impeachment? REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, now that I've heard that the Speaker is looking for evidence that crimes may have been committed, I certainly want to direct her attention to the thirty-five articles of impeachment that I presented, which assert quite directly that crimes have been committed, including taking this nation into a war, an illegal war, based on lies; including the deaths of over a million innocent Iraqis, which constitute a war crime; including wiretapping, rendition, torture, illegal detention. There are many examples of laws that have been broken. And the reason why the Judiciary Committee should hold a hearing on the impeachment itself is because there needs to be a public airing of this. So, I have a great deal of respect for Speaker Pelosi, and I think that since she made that statement on The View , there's an opportunity now for us to come forward and to lay all the facts out so that she can reconsider her decision not to permit the Judiciary Committee to proceed with a full impeachment hearing. I just want to state this, that I appreciate that she consented to a hearing on Friday. It was a six-hour hearing, over a dozen witnesses. Twenty-four members of Congress attended. It's being taken seriously. I think the idea that nothing can be done right now because we're on the eve of an election raises questions about our constitutional responsibility to be a check and balance to administration abuse of power. If in fact we're in a war that's based on lies, and we have thousands of troops whose lives are on the line every day, we owe it to them and we owe it to the American people to set straight the public record. And then, whether or not it results in the President being removed from office before the end of his term is another matter. I want to further say that with the possibility of a war in Iran in the offing, a war against Iran, a war that would be a result of a pre-emptive attack, much like the one that the United States launched against Iraq, it becomes very important that we hold this administration to the highest standard of having to verify the statements they make to take us into one war and to try to take us into another. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, Congressman Dennis Kucinich of Ohio, thank you, once again, for joining us. And we're going to continue the conversation here on the stadium issues with Bettina Damiani of Good Jobs New York and Neil deMause, author of Field of Schemes . I'd like to - again, getting back to the stadium deal, this Yankee Stadium is the most expensive stadium in the history of the United States. The actual cost is very hard to get your hands around, because there are some public infrastructure subsidies. But we're talking about a stadium that is going to be somewhere between one and two billion dollars, when you add up all of the actual costs, probably closer to two. And, Neil, could you talk about this - how the public expenditures are being used, even though we're being told that they're not being - public money is not being used directly for the stadium? NEIL DEMAUSE : Sure. I mean, it's something I've been trying to track ever since this was first announced three years ago. There is, as you mentioned, this infrastructure cost, where the public is paying for building new parks to replace the ones that were torn down to make way for the new stadium, paying for moving a water main and other things like that. JUAN GONZALEZ : And when you say parks that were torn down, because that was, itself, a big issue -- NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah, this -- JUAN GONZALEZ : - this is public park land, about a - what was it? Twenty acres or at least -- NEIL DEMAUSE : It was like twenty-two acres that was actually demolished. It was park that had been there even longer than Yankee Stadium that was demolished to make way for the new stadium. To make up for this, the city and state had to make sure that there was an equal amount of park land that was created. So they're knocking down the old stadium completely. Originally, the team was talking, \"Oh, we're going to save it as a museum.\" It's going to be gone starting next year, and they're going to put some ball fields there. And they've found some space down by the Harlem River where they're going to squeeze in some tennis courts, and sort of little patchwork of parks around different places. The public is paying for all that. The public is paying for the actual demolition of Yankee Stadium, is all going to be public. The public is paying a good chunk for building new parking garages for the Yankees, including one that will be used by the players and VIPs and various folks like that. And the team is getting all sorts of different tax breaks. As Bettina mentioned, they're not going to be paying property taxes. They're going to be getting mortgage-recording taxes. They're going to be getting these tax-exempt bonds that we've been talking about, which is actually a tremendous amount of money, if they get the new $300 million in bonds they're looking for. They're going to be talking about getting more than $300 million worth of tax breaks just on the bonds themselves. So when you add it all up, you get somewhere around $900 million worth of public money that's being spent just on Yankee Stadium. JUAN GONZALEZ : Bettina, those who advocate these stadiums say, \"Why not? This is economic development. It's creating jobs. It's keeping a sort of a -- the psychology of the city by having a professional sports team that the residents can root for.\" What's wrong with it? BETTINA DAMIANI : All the subsidies that Neil just listed. You would like to assume that the city and the state made a clear path to making sure that there were going to be jobs, good-paying jobs for New Yorkers, on the other end. That was going to be the investment, right? We see nothing. There's nothing that says a certain number of jobs has to be set aside for either local New York residents or local Bronx residents, or the number of jobs at all. The city has really washed their hands of making sure there's any accountability on jobs and clear benefits for New Yorkers on the other side of this project, which is very unfortunate. I mean, we're grateful for Congressman Kucinich and Assembly member Brodsky to get involved in this issue. Neither represent New York City, by the way. New York City elected officials - they're filling a void, because local elected officials in New York City have refused to get involved in this project. And we need them. We need them to make sure that the promises in the press releases actually turn out to be something that we can hold them accountable for. JUAN GONZALEZ : And you have, generally speaking, on this issue of tax-exempt financing for economic development, raised numerous questions over the years. It's been one of my favorite topics, how cities are siphoning off their tax bases to create special deals for developers, whether it's sports teams or private companies, where they're, in essence, siphoning off the existing tax base from the municipal government and using it to fund special projects. How rampant is this, not only in New York, but throughout the country? BETTINA DAMIANI : It's a terrible issue regarding not only the issue of financing, but making sure that there are quality jobs for Americans and, in our case, New Yorkers. There's a thing called the economic war among the states, where it seems that so many municipalities and states are worried about fighting one another for the headquarters of a particular agency that they're willing to set aside basic fiscal commonsense and not making sure that there are real quality jobs on the ends of these big deals. Site consultants are prevalent throughout the country that have really manufactured this process, and they make it seem like if the Yankees didn't get their subsidy or if the New York Stock Exchange didn't get a subsidy, they were going to flee somewhere else, without taking into consideration or doing some real due diligence. Where were the Yankees going to go? The Yankees are famous because they're in the Bronx. We have a large media here. We have an incredible fan base here. And it seems none of that was taken in consideration before this huge giveaway was done. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, that's one of the things I think Assembly member Brodsky is trying to investigate, because the city agency that engineered this deal, the Industrial Development Authority, apparently said that the Yankees were threatening to leave New York, of course, the most expensive media market in the country, the most desirable media market in the country. Neil, your sense of whether that was real or not? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah, I mean, and I think everyone knows that the Yankees were not going to move out of New York City, and it's kind of been an open secret for decades now, as long as George Steinbrenner has been demanding a stadium. Where is he going to go? The Yankees are not worth the, whatever, billion dollars that they're worth if they move to Charlotte, North Carolina. But that was the pretense. And the Yankees actually told the judge in a case trying to stop the demolition of the parks, \"Well, if you try and hold up this case, the Yankees could move.\" And, you know, they've been allowed to get away with this. And as Bettina was saying, elected officials never challenged them on this, until, you know, recently Brodsky is trying - been trying to track it down. JUAN GONZALEZ : And, of course, the final irony of all of this is, in the new stadium, once it gets built, as with all these stadiums, the ticket prices for the average baseball fan go through the roof. The prices in Yankee Stadium for box seats now are astronomical -- they're astronomical now, but what they will cost in the new stadium is unbelievable. Could you talk about some of the prices that they've released so far? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah. I mean, they're talking over, you know, $1,000, $2,000 a seat for some of the really premium seats. And I think what you're going to see is -- JUAN GONZALEZ : For one game? NEIL DEMAUSE : For one game, yes. For one game, yes, absolutely. For a whole season, you know, all bets are off. But I think, you know, what you're going to see the Yankees do, they've promised to keep bleacher tickets low. They've promised to keep a certain number of, you know, $25-or-less seats. I think what you're going to see them do is, especially with Brodsky and everyone else paying attention to the soaring costs, I think you're going to see the Yankees keep ticket prices low for the first season or two and, you know, try to say, \"OK, we're holding the line.\" And then, as everybody's clamoring to get tickets, two, three years down the road, you'll see those start to creep up. So, what I'm worried about isn't, next year, is it going to be affordable, but three years from now, is anybody going to be able to get a ticket? JUAN GONZALEZ : Right. And then, of course, the final irony with - because most of these stadiums have luxury boxes that are for corporations that go from $500,000 to $800,000, in the case of the Yankees, per year to rent these boxes, and of course, my newspaper, the Daily News , reported yesterday that in this deal, the City of New York arranged to have its own luxury box at Yankee Stadium available, presumably to city officials, as part of the deal for the financing. Bettina, your response to that? BETTINA DAMIANI : It's aptly coined the landlord suite. And it's just another example of how local elected officials almost seem to be void of feeling that they have responsibility to the public, because they're going to get nice seats, in the long run. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, I want to thank both of you for being with us, Bettina Damiani, the project director of Good Jobs New York, and Neil deMause, who's a writer and the author of Field of Schemes: How the Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money into Private Profit .\n\nCongressman Kucinich is looking into whether city officials overvalued the stadium site by several times its actual price. The Yankees would have avoided - or the bond-holders would have avoided millions in taxes, because they would be exempt from paying taxes on interest they earn. Meanwhile, the Yankees have requested an additional $336 million in tax-free bonds to help complete the stadium. In a letter sent earlier this month to Yankees president Randy Levine, New York Assemblyman Richard Brodsky noted that the tax-free interest earned on the stadium bonds \"normally would go into the city's coffers to pay for schools, police and health care.\" Today, we host a discussion on public subsidies for sports stadiums.

I'd like to begin with Congressman Kucinich. You have, as of last week, made a request to the City of New York and to the New York Yankees for a variety of documents as part of your continuing investigation into possible abuses of federal laws and IRS regulations relating to these kind of stadium projects. Could you tell us what you're trying to do with that investigation and why you decided to focus in on New York and the Yankees? REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, this is a project that's imminent, and we have - the thing that I think, you know, caught my attention is when you have an independent appraisal of the land that the Yankees want to get for their new stadium of $45 per square foot, and yet the city had an appraisal that appraised the same land at $275 a square foot. Now, what our committee is trying to find out is, does the city's assessment represent a deliberate inflation of the value of the land so that there would be a greater number of tax-free bonds issued, thereby raising questions of, you know, an inappropriate increased diversion of federal tax monies for this kind of private project. JUAN GONZALEZ : Now, you have been, for now several months, actually, questioning the IRS about the original waiver, in essence, that they gave the Yankees a few years ago and the New York Mets for the building of their hugely expensive stadiums. Could you tell our viewers and listeners what is the crux of the concern that you have with how the IRS is functioning? REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, in 1986, there was a change in the tax law which made it very clear that stadiums could not be using these tax-exempt bonds to construct these professional sports stadiums. The IRS had a ruling in a private letter that essentially gave the sports teams the ability to make payments in lieu of taxes, which was kind of a loophole that enabled them to get to the point of being able to participate in these tax-free financing schemes. And so, I've had a hearing where we talked to the IRS , asked them for an explanation. And from what I understand, as a result of our hearing, they're reviewing their policies to see whether or not the 1986 Tax Reform Act has actually been compromised by the decision that they made. I think that it's important to understand that we're not alleging, at this point, that there's been any kind of criminal activity. We're simply reviewing all the information that's been presented to us, so that we can determine, first of all, the discrepancies in the appraisals, secondly, the public policy issue of using tax-exempt bonds for these stadiums, and third, if there is an inflated value of this project, the implication that it has for security laws with respect to the issuance of the tremendous amount of bond financing. JUAN GONZALEZ : I'd like ask Bettina Damiani from Good Jobs New York, this whole issue of this thing called \"PILOTs,\" or payments in lieu of taxes, for use of repaying these tax-exempt bonds, is a very complicated issue that most the general public doesn't understand. Your organization has been in the forefront of questioning these kinds of development deals by New York, but also, by extension, by many municipalities around the country. Could you break down how these PILOTs work generally? BETTINA DAMIANI : Certainly. And it's not just the average New Yorker, as we learned through the Yankee Stadium project. Most New York City and New York State elected officials don't quite understand the issue of PILOTs, which is part of the crux of this issue. Essentially, PILOTs are payments in lieu of taxes. Instead of paying taxes, the Yankees are paying back their tax-free bonds. So, there's money that should be going into, as Assembly member Brodsky mentioned, the pot of money that would help pay for roads and schools and other services that New York City needs. Instead, it's just going - it's being completely diverted. And this, unfortunately, is a policy that is not done just with the Yankees but with a variety of other very large financial firms that have managed to make a special deal with New York City. JUAN GONZALEZ : And in this particular case, it was actually in the interest of the New York Yankees to have a very high assessment of their land, because that would allow them to be able to float more bonds and pay more PILOTs, which is their main goal here, is to raise as much money as possible to build their stadium, right? BETTINA DAMIANI : Exactly, and that's the irony. And that's one of the things that you mentioned in your article yesterday, is that in the South Bronx, the city was trying desperately to inflate the value of property, but not to benefit the larger community or the people that live in the neighborhood, but really for the sole benefit of the New York Yankees. JUAN GONZALEZ : And, Neil deMause, you've been writing now for quite a while about these stadium boondoggles. Virtually every major city in America is building a new arena or a new stadium of one kind, and most of them are using some degree or other of public financing. Could you give us a sense of the overall national picture? NEIL DEMAUSE : Sure. I mean, I think it's absolutely correct that every major and minor city is either building a stadium or arena or being asked to estimate somewhere around $2 billion a year of public money going into these buildings, a very, very small percentage of which comes back in terms of, you know, tax benefits or actually benefits to the cities. You know, when the Yankees and the Mets first announced their deals, Mayor Bloomberg said, \"Oh, you know, we don't make subsidies; we make investments, and we get our money back.\" At the time, it was announced, well, the Yankees and Mets are going to be paying for, you know, all the construction costs of the stadium. As you look at it and break down where they're getting tax breaks and where they're getting sort of hidden subsidies, the taxpayers wind up paying most of the cost. JUAN GONZALEZ : And, Congressman Kucinich, you originally had scheduled your hearing for this week but then decided to postpone it until September. Have you been in conversations with the City of New York and with the Yankees about them also testifying at your hearing? And what documents, specifically, are you trying to get from them now? REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, I could say that my subcommittee staff - and again, I'm the chair of the Domestic Policy Subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over this matter - and our subcommittee staff is in contact with officials of both the City of New York and the New York Yankees to discuss their potential appearance in front of our congressional subcommittee. I think that it's very important to understand that we're looking at a public policy matter here that relates not only to New York and not only to the Nets and the Atlantic Yard project, but it also relates to the whole country, as your other guests have said, because it's quite possible that there are billions of dollars in tax benefits that should be going to municipalities for the purposes of repairing their infrastructure and for schools and other things and that are instead being diverted for these private sports complexes. And the question is one of public policy, one of the IRS , and in the case of the New York Yankees, questions of securities law, because of the various amounts of the appraisal, $45 a square foot versus $275 a square foot, which have a bearing on the overall cost of the project. And if the cost of the project is inflated, that's going to be of interest to the SEC , as well as the IRS . JUAN GONZALEZ : And in terms of the - you're not, at this point, contemplating subpoenaing any records. You're figuring that they are going to be - they will provide you the documents and the information that you requested to avoid that potential. REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, you know, we generally assume that we'll get cooperation. I mean, certainly, as an investigative subcommittee, if we need to enforce that request with a subpoena, we have the ability to apply for that. But we're not at that point yet. And, you know, we're hopeful for cooperation on the part of all the parties involved. And I think that, again, this is a matter of serious public policy. When you have New York City, a great American city, which has all these capital infrastructure needs, and when payments get diverted, essentially - payments are not going into areas where the city expects the tax revenues will be coming from, and instead they're diverted in these payments in lieu of taxes, they're intensely serious matters that need to be discussed. And so, that's why the work that Mr. Brodsky is doing and your other guests are involved in is very significant. We're going to continue with our work on the Domestic Policy Subcommittee, and we'll be sure to keep you posted. JUAN GONZALEZ : OK. We're talking with Congressman Dennis Kucinich in Washington, and here also, Bettina Damiani of Good Jobs New York and Neil deMause, the author of Field of Schemes . We're going to return in a minute and to continue the conversation. And before Congressman Kucinich leaves, we also want to ask him about the hearings in Congress, the potential impeachment hearings. We'll be back in a minute. [break] JUAN GONZALEZ : We're talking about the use of public subsidies for sports stadiums. We're joined from Washington, D.C. by Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich. And here in New York, we have Bettina Damiani, the project director of Good Jobs New York, and Neil deMause, author of Field of Schemes: How the Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money into Private Profit . But, Congressman Kucinich, you've been leading the fight for impeachment, and I know you have to go very soon, so I wanted to ask you about an interview with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that aired on The View earlier this week. She was asked about impeachment. JOY BEHAR : You've ruled against impeaching George Bush and Dick Cheney, and now Kucinich is trying to pass that. Why do you insist on not impeaching these people, so that the world and America can really see the crimes that they've committed? REP . NANCY PELOSI : Well, I think that it - I think it was important, when I became Speaker - and it's, by the way, a very important position - President, Vice President, Speaker of the House - I saw it as my responsibility to try to bring a much divided country together to the extent that we could. I thought that impeachment would be divisive for the country. In terms of what we wanted - set out to do, we wanted to raise the minimum wage, give the biggest increase in veterans benefits to veterans in the seventy-seven-year history, then pass research for stem cell research, all of that. This week, we're going to pass equal pay for equal work. It has been a long time in coming - pay equity. We're going to pass legislations for product safety, for toys that children put in their - there's an agenda that you have to get done. You have to try to do it in a bipartisan way. The President has to sign it. If somebody had a crime that the President had committed, that would be a different story. JOY BEHAR : Can they still do it after he's out? BARBARA WALTERS : When we - when I interviewed you last year, you had just begun, and you were going to clean up the mess, remember? REP . NANCY PELOSI : And we did. BARBARA WALTERS : You look around this country, 75 percent of the country - forget George Bush - thinks that Congress is doing a lousy job. ELISABETH HASSELBECK : I think it's 91 percent now. REP . NANCY PELOSI : Well, I don't disagree with that, because largely it's predicated on ending the war in Iraq. That's the main question, and we were not successful. In our House of Representatives, I'm very proud of our members, because they voted overwhelmingly over and over again to bring the war to an end, bring the troops home safely and soon, sent it to the Senate, and it hits a dead end. But in terms of that particular standard, I would say I disapprove, as well. But we do - we passed some of the things I just mentioned, the energy bill. We worked in a bipartisan way, Innovation Agenda. We have to create jobs, expand healthcare, protect the American people and educate our children. And you can't do that if you're trying to impeach the President at the same time, unless you have the goods that this president committed crimes. JUAN GONZALEZ : That was House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Congressman Kucinich, your response to her take on the situation with impeachment? REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, now that I've heard that the Speaker is looking for evidence that crimes may have been committed, I certainly want to direct her attention to the thirty-five articles of impeachment that I presented, which assert quite directly that crimes have been committed, including taking this nation into a war, an illegal war, based on lies; including the deaths of over a million innocent Iraqis, which constitute a war crime; including wiretapping, rendition, torture, illegal detention. There are many examples of laws that have been broken. And the reason why the Judiciary Committee should hold a hearing on the impeachment itself is because there needs to be a public airing of this. So, I have a great deal of respect for Speaker Pelosi, and I think that since she made that statement on The View , there's an opportunity now for us to come forward and to lay all the facts out so that she can reconsider her decision not to permit the Judiciary Committee to proceed with a full impeachment hearing. I just want to state this, that I appreciate that she consented to a hearing on Friday. It was a six-hour hearing, over a dozen witnesses. Twenty-four members of Congress attended. It's being taken seriously. I think the idea that nothing can be done right now because we're on the eve of an election raises questions about our constitutional responsibility to be a check and balance to administration abuse of power. If in fact we're in a war that's based on lies, and we have thousands of troops whose lives are on the line every day, we owe it to them and we owe it to the American people to set straight the public record. And then, whether or not it results in the President being removed from office before the end of his term is another matter. I want to further say that with the possibility of a war in Iran in the offing, a war against Iran, a war that would be a result of a pre-emptive attack, much like the one that the United States launched against Iraq, it becomes very important that we hold this administration to the highest standard of having to verify the statements they make to take us into one war and to try to take us into another. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, Congressman Dennis Kucinich of Ohio, thank you, once again, for joining us. And we're going to continue the conversation here on the stadium issues with Bettina Damiani of Good Jobs New York and Neil deMause, author of Field of Schemes . I'd like to - again, getting back to the stadium deal, this Yankee Stadium is the most expensive stadium in the history of the United States. The actual cost is very hard to get your hands around, because there are some public infrastructure subsidies. But we're talking about a stadium that is going to be somewhere between one and two billion dollars, when you add up all of the actual costs, probably closer to two. And, Neil, could you talk about this - how the public expenditures are being used, even though we're being told that they're not being - public money is not being used directly for the stadium? NEIL DEMAUSE : Sure. I mean, it's something I've been trying to track ever since this was first announced three years ago. There is, as you mentioned, this infrastructure cost, where the public is paying for building new parks to replace the ones that were torn down to make way for the new stadium, paying for moving a water main and other things like that. JUAN GONZALEZ : And when you say parks that were torn down, because that was, itself, a big issue -- NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah, this -- JUAN GONZALEZ : - this is public park land, about a - what was it? Twenty acres or at least -- NEIL DEMAUSE : It was like twenty-two acres that was actually demolished. It was park that had been there even longer than Yankee Stadium that was demolished to make way for the new stadium. To make up for this, the city and state had to make sure that there was an equal amount of park land that was created. So they're knocking down the old stadium completely. Originally, the team was talking, \"Oh, we're going to save it as a museum.\" It's going to be gone starting next year, and they're going to put some ball fields there. And they've found some space down by the Harlem River where they're going to squeeze in some tennis courts, and sort of little patchwork of parks around different places. The public is paying for all that. The public is paying for the actual demolition of Yankee Stadium, is all going to be public. The public is paying a good chunk for building new parking garages for the Yankees, including one that will be used by the players and VIPs and various folks like that. And the team is getting all sorts of different tax breaks. As Bettina mentioned, they're not going to be paying property taxes. They're going to be getting mortgage-recording taxes. They're going to be getting these tax-exempt bonds that we've been talking about, which is actually a tremendous amount of money, if they get the new $300 million in bonds they're looking for. They're going to be talking about getting more than $300 million worth of tax breaks just on the bonds themselves. So when you add it all up, you get somewhere around $900 million worth of public money that's being spent just on Yankee Stadium. JUAN GONZALEZ : Bettina, those who advocate these stadiums say, \"Why not? This is economic development. It's creating jobs. It's keeping a sort of a -- the psychology of the city by having a professional sports team that the residents can root for.\" What's wrong with it? BETTINA DAMIANI : All the subsidies that Neil just listed. You would like to assume that the city and the state made a clear path to making sure that there were going to be jobs, good-paying jobs for New Yorkers, on the other end. That was going to be the investment, right? We see nothing. There's nothing that says a certain number of jobs has to be set aside for either local New York residents or local Bronx residents, or the number of jobs at all. The city has really washed their hands of making sure there's any accountability on jobs and clear benefits for New Yorkers on the other side of this project, which is very unfortunate. I mean, we're grateful for Congressman Kucinich and Assembly member Brodsky to get involved in this issue. Neither represent New York City, by the way. New York City elected officials - they're filling a void, because local elected officials in New York City have refused to get involved in this project. And we need them. We need them to make sure that the promises in the press releases actually turn out to be something that we can hold them accountable for. JUAN GONZALEZ : And you have, generally speaking, on this issue of tax-exempt financing for economic development, raised numerous questions over the years. It's been one of my favorite topics, how cities are siphoning off their tax bases to create special deals for developers, whether it's sports teams or private companies, where they're, in essence, siphoning off the existing tax base from the municipal government and using it to fund special projects. How rampant is this, not only in New York, but throughout the country? BETTINA DAMIANI : It's a terrible issue regarding not only the issue of financing, but making sure that there are quality jobs for Americans and, in our case, New Yorkers. There's a thing called the economic war among the states, where it seems that so many municipalities and states are worried about fighting one another for the headquarters of a particular agency that they're willing to set aside basic fiscal commonsense and not making sure that there are real quality jobs on the ends of these big deals. Site consultants are prevalent throughout the country that have really manufactured this process, and they make it seem like if the Yankees didn't get their subsidy or if the New York Stock Exchange didn't get a subsidy, they were going to flee somewhere else, without taking into consideration or doing some real due diligence. Where were the Yankees going to go? The Yankees are famous because they're in the Bronx. We have a large media here. We have an incredible fan base here. And it seems none of that was taken in consideration before this huge giveaway was done. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, that's one of the things I think Assembly member Brodsky is trying to investigate, because the city agency that engineered this deal, the Industrial Development Authority, apparently said that the Yankees were threatening to leave New York, of course, the most expensive media market in the country, the most desirable media market in the country. Neil, your sense of whether that was real or not? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah, I mean, and I think everyone knows that the Yankees were not going to move out of New York City, and it's kind of been an open secret for decades now, as long as George Steinbrenner has been demanding a stadium. Where is he going to go? The Yankees are not worth the, whatever, billion dollars that they're worth if they move to Charlotte, North Carolina. But that was the pretense. And the Yankees actually told the judge in a case trying to stop the demolition of the parks, \"Well, if you try and hold up this case, the Yankees could move.\" And, you know, they've been allowed to get away with this. And as Bettina was saying, elected officials never challenged them on this, until, you know, recently Brodsky is trying - been trying to track it down. JUAN GONZALEZ : And, of course, the final irony of all of this is, in the new stadium, once it gets built, as with all these stadiums, the ticket prices for the average baseball fan go through the roof. The prices in Yankee Stadium for box seats now are astronomical -- they're astronomical now, but what they will cost in the new stadium is unbelievable. Could you talk about some of the prices that they've released so far? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah. I mean, they're talking over, you know, $1,000, $2,000 a seat for some of the really premium seats. And I think what you're going to see is -- JUAN GONZALEZ : For one game? NEIL DEMAUSE : For one game, yes. For one game, yes, absolutely. For a whole season, you know, all bets are off. But I think, you know, what you're going to see the Yankees do, they've promised to keep bleacher tickets low. They've promised to keep a certain number of, you know, $25-or-less seats. I think what you're going to see them do is, especially with Brodsky and everyone else paying attention to the soaring costs, I think you're going to see the Yankees keep ticket prices low for the first season or two and, you know, try to say, \"OK, we're holding the line.\" And then, as everybody's clamoring to get tickets, two, three years down the road, you'll see those start to creep up. So, what I'm worried about isn't, next year, is it going to be affordable, but three years from now, is anybody going to be able to get a ticket? JUAN GONZALEZ : Right. And then, of course, the final irony with - because most of these stadiums have luxury boxes that are for corporations that go from $500,000 to $800,000, in the case of the Yankees, per year to rent these boxes, and of course, my newspaper, the Daily News , reported yesterday that in this deal, the City of New York arranged to have its own luxury box at Yankee Stadium available, presumably to city officials, as part of the deal for the financing. Bettina, your response to that? BETTINA DAMIANI : It's aptly coined the landlord suite. And it's just another example of how local elected officials almost seem to be void of feeling that they have responsibility to the public, because they're going to get nice seats, in the long run. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, I want to thank both of you for being with us, Bettina Damiani, the project director of Good Jobs New York, and Neil deMause, who's a writer and the author of Field of Schemes: How the Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money into Private Profit .\n\nIn a letter sent earlier this month to Yankees president Randy Levine, New York Assemblyman Richard Brodsky noted that the tax-free interest earned on the stadium bonds \"normally would go into the city's coffers to pay for schools, police and health care.\" Today, we host a discussion on public subsidies for sports stadiums. Congressman Dennis Kucinich joins us from the Capitol Rotunda in Washington, D.C. I'm also joined here in the firehouse studio by two guests: Bettina Damiani is the project director of Good Jobs New York, and Neil deMause is a writer and the author of Field of Schemes: How the Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money into Private Profit . I'd like to begin with Congressman Kucinich.

NANCY PELOSI : Well, I think that it - I think it was important, when I became Speaker - and it's, by the way, a very important position - President, Vice President, Speaker of the House - I saw it as my responsibility to try to bring a much divided country together to the extent that we could. I thought that impeachment would be divisive for the country. In terms of what we wanted - set out to do, we wanted to raise the minimum wage, give the biggest increase in veterans benefits to veterans in the seventy-seven-year history, then pass research for stem cell research, all of that. This week, we're going to pass equal pay for equal work. It has been a long time in coming - pay equity. We're going to pass legislations for product safety, for toys that children put in their - there's an agenda that you have to get done. You have to try to do it in a bipartisan way. The President has to sign it. If somebody had a crime that the President had committed, that would be a different story. JOY BEHAR : Can they still do it after he's out? BARBARA WALTERS : When we - when I interviewed you last year, you had just begun, and you were going to clean up the mess, remember? REP . NANCY PELOSI : And we did. BARBARA WALTERS : You look around this country, 75 percent of the country - forget George Bush - thinks that Congress is doing a lousy job. ELISABETH HASSELBECK : I think it's 91 percent now. REP . NANCY PELOSI : Well, I don't disagree with that, because largely it's predicated on ending the war in Iraq. That's the main question, and we were not successful. In our House of Representatives, I'm very proud of our members, because they voted overwhelmingly over and over again to bring the war to an end, bring the troops home safely and soon, sent it to the Senate, and it hits a dead end. But in terms of that particular standard, I would say I disapprove, as well. But we do - we passed some of the things I just mentioned, the energy bill. We worked in a bipartisan way, Innovation Agenda. We have to create jobs, expand healthcare, protect the American people and educate our children. And you can't do that if you're trying to impeach the President at the same time, unless you have the goods that this president committed crimes. JUAN GONZALEZ : That was House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Congressman Kucinich, your response to her take on the situation with impeachment? REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, now that I've heard that the Speaker is looking for evidence that crimes may have been committed, I certainly want to direct her attention to the thirty-five articles of impeachment that I presented, which assert quite directly that crimes have been committed, including taking this nation into a war, an illegal war, based on lies; including the deaths of over a million innocent Iraqis, which constitute a war crime; including wiretapping, rendition, torture, illegal detention. There are many examples of laws that have been broken. And the reason why the Judiciary Committee should hold a hearing on the impeachment itself is because there needs to be a public airing of this. So, I have a great deal of respect for Speaker Pelosi, and I think that since she made that statement on The View , there's an opportunity now for us to come forward and to lay all the facts out so that she can reconsider her decision not to permit the Judiciary Committee to proceed with a full impeachment hearing. I just want to state this, that I appreciate that she consented to a hearing on Friday. It was a six-hour hearing, over a dozen witnesses. Twenty-four members of Congress attended. It's being taken seriously. I think the idea that nothing can be done right now because we're on the eve of an election raises questions about our constitutional responsibility to be a check and balance to administration abuse of power. If in fact we're in a war that's based on lies, and we have thousands of troops whose lives are on the line every day, we owe it to them and we owe it to the American people to set straight the public record. And then, whether or not it results in the President being removed from office before the end of his term is another matter. I want to further say that with the possibility of a war in Iran in the offing, a war against Iran, a war that would be a result of a pre-emptive attack, much like the one that the United States launched against Iraq, it becomes very important that we hold this administration to the highest standard of having to verify the statements they make to take us into one war and to try to take us into another. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, Congressman Dennis Kucinich of Ohio, thank you, once again, for joining us. And we're going to continue the conversation here on the stadium issues with Bettina Damiani of Good Jobs New York and Neil deMause, author of Field of Schemes . I'd like to - again, getting back to the stadium deal, this Yankee Stadium is the most expensive stadium in the history of the United States. The actual cost is very hard to get your hands around, because there are some public infrastructure subsidies. But we're talking about a stadium that is going to be somewhere between one and two billion dollars, when you add up all of the actual costs, probably closer to two. And, Neil, could you talk about this - how the public expenditures are being used, even though we're being told that they're not being - public money is not being used directly for the stadium? NEIL DEMAUSE : Sure. I mean, it's something I've been trying to track ever since this was first announced three years ago. There is, as you mentioned, this infrastructure cost, where the public is paying for building new parks to replace the ones that were torn down to make way for the new stadium, paying for moving a water main and other things like that. JUAN GONZALEZ : And when you say parks that were torn down, because that was, itself, a big issue -- NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah, this -- JUAN GONZALEZ : - this is public park land, about a - what was it? Twenty acres or at least -- NEIL DEMAUSE : It was like twenty-two acres that was actually demolished. It was park that had been there even longer than Yankee Stadium that was demolished to make way for the new stadium. To make up for this, the city and state had to make sure that there was an equal amount of park land that was created. So they're knocking down the old stadium completely. Originally, the team was talking, \"Oh, we're going to save it as a museum.\" It's going to be gone starting next year, and they're going to put some ball fields there. And they've found some space down by the Harlem River where they're going to squeeze in some tennis courts, and sort of little patchwork of parks around different places. The public is paying for all that. The public is paying for the actual demolition of Yankee Stadium, is all going to be public. The public is paying a good chunk for building new parking garages for the Yankees, including one that will be used by the players and VIPs and various folks like that. And the team is getting all sorts of different tax breaks. As Bettina mentioned, they're not going to be paying property taxes. They're going to be getting mortgage-recording taxes. They're going to be getting these tax-exempt bonds that we've been talking about, which is actually a tremendous amount of money, if they get the new $300 million in bonds they're looking for. They're going to be talking about getting more than $300 million worth of tax breaks just on the bonds themselves. So when you add it all up, you get somewhere around $900 million worth of public money that's being spent just on Yankee Stadium. JUAN GONZALEZ : Bettina, those who advocate these stadiums say, \"Why not? This is economic development. It's creating jobs. It's keeping a sort of a -- the psychology of the city by having a professional sports team that the residents can root for.\" What's wrong with it? BETTINA DAMIANI : All the subsidies that Neil just listed. You would like to assume that the city and the state made a clear path to making sure that there were going to be jobs, good-paying jobs for New Yorkers, on the other end. That was going to be the investment, right? We see nothing. There's nothing that says a certain number of jobs has to be set aside for either local New York residents or local Bronx residents, or the number of jobs at all. The city has really washed their hands of making sure there's any accountability on jobs and clear benefits for New Yorkers on the other side of this project, which is very unfortunate. I mean, we're grateful for Congressman Kucinich and Assembly member Brodsky to get involved in this issue. Neither represent New York City, by the way. New York City elected officials - they're filling a void, because local elected officials in New York City have refused to get involved in this project. And we need them. We need them to make sure that the promises in the press releases actually turn out to be something that we can hold them accountable for. JUAN GONZALEZ : And you have, generally speaking, on this issue of tax-exempt financing for economic development, raised numerous questions over the years. It's been one of my favorite topics, how cities are siphoning off their tax bases to create special deals for developers, whether it's sports teams or private companies, where they're, in essence, siphoning off the existing tax base from the municipal government and using it to fund special projects. How rampant is this, not only in New York, but throughout the country? BETTINA DAMIANI : It's a terrible issue regarding not only the issue of financing, but making sure that there are quality jobs for Americans and, in our case, New Yorkers. There's a thing called the economic war among the states, where it seems that so many municipalities and states are worried about fighting one another for the headquarters of a particular agency that they're willing to set aside basic fiscal commonsense and not making sure that there are real quality jobs on the ends of these big deals. Site consultants are prevalent throughout the country that have really manufactured this process, and they make it seem like if the Yankees didn't get their subsidy or if the New York Stock Exchange didn't get a subsidy, they were going to flee somewhere else, without taking into consideration or doing some real due diligence. Where were the Yankees going to go? The Yankees are famous because they're in the Bronx. We have a large media here. We have an incredible fan base here. And it seems none of that was taken in consideration before this huge giveaway was done. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, that's one of the things I think Assembly member Brodsky is trying to investigate, because the city agency that engineered this deal, the Industrial Development Authority, apparently said that the Yankees were threatening to leave New York, of course, the most expensive media market in the country, the most desirable media market in the country. Neil, your sense of whether that was real or not? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah, I mean, and I think everyone knows that the Yankees were not going to move out of New York City, and it's kind of been an open secret for decades now, as long as George Steinbrenner has been demanding a stadium. Where is he going to go? The Yankees are not worth the, whatever, billion dollars that they're worth if they move to Charlotte, North Carolina. But that was the pretense. And the Yankees actually told the judge in a case trying to stop the demolition of the parks, \"Well, if you try and hold up this case, the Yankees could move.\" And, you know, they've been allowed to get away with this. And as Bettina was saying, elected officials never challenged them on this, until, you know, recently Brodsky is trying - been trying to track it down. JUAN GONZALEZ : And, of course, the final irony of all of this is, in the new stadium, once it gets built, as with all these stadiums, the ticket prices for the average baseball fan go through the roof. The prices in Yankee Stadium for box seats now are astronomical -- they're astronomical now, but what they will cost in the new stadium is unbelievable. Could you talk about some of the prices that they've released so far? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah. I mean, they're talking over, you know, $1,000, $2,000 a seat for some of the really premium seats. And I think what you're going to see is -- JUAN GONZALEZ : For one game? NEIL DEMAUSE : For one game, yes. For one game, yes, absolutely. For a whole season, you know, all bets are off. But I think, you know, what you're going to see the Yankees do, they've promised to keep bleacher tickets low. They've promised to keep a certain number of, you know, $25-or-less seats. I think what you're going to see them do is, especially with Brodsky and everyone else paying attention to the soaring costs, I think you're going to see the Yankees keep ticket prices low for the first season or two and, you know, try to say, \"OK, we're holding the line.\" And then, as everybody's clamoring to get tickets, two, three years down the road, you'll see those start to creep up. So, what I'm worried about isn't, next year, is it going to be affordable, but three years from now, is anybody going to be able to get a ticket? JUAN GONZALEZ : Right. And then, of course, the final irony with - because most of these stadiums have luxury boxes that are for corporations that go from $500,000 to $800,000, in the case of the Yankees, per year to rent these boxes, and of course, my newspaper, the Daily News , reported yesterday that in this deal, the City of New York arranged to have its own luxury box at Yankee Stadium available, presumably to city officials, as part of the deal for the financing. Bettina, your response to that? BETTINA DAMIANI : It's aptly coined the landlord suite. And it's just another example of how local elected officials almost seem to be void of feeling that they have responsibility to the public, because they're going to get nice seats, in the long run. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, I want to thank both of you for being with us, Bettina Damiani, the project director of Good Jobs New York, and Neil deMause, who's a writer and the author of Field of Schemes: How the Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money into Private Profit .\n\nToday, we host a discussion on public subsidies for sports stadiums. Congressman Dennis Kucinich joins us from the Capitol Rotunda in Washington, D.C. I'm also joined here in the firehouse studio by two guests: Bettina Damiani is the project director of Good Jobs New York, and Neil deMause is a writer and the author of Field of Schemes: How the Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money into Private Profit . I'd like to begin with Congressman Kucinich. You have, as of last week, made a request to the City of New York and to the New York Yankees for a variety of documents as part of your continuing investigation into possible abuses of federal laws and IRS regulations relating to these kind of stadium projects. Could you tell us what you're trying to do with that investigation and why you decided to focus in on New York and the Yankees? REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, this is a project that's imminent, and we have - the thing that I think, you know, caught my attention is when you have an independent appraisal of the land that the Yankees want to get for their new stadium of $45 per square foot, and yet the city had an appraisal that appraised the same land at $275 a square foot. Now, what our committee is trying to find out is, does the city's assessment represent a deliberate inflation of the value of the land so that there would be a greater number of tax-free bonds issued, thereby raising questions of, you know, an inappropriate increased diversion of federal tax monies for this kind of private project. JUAN GONZALEZ : Now, you have been, for now several months, actually, questioning the IRS about the original waiver, in essence, that they gave the Yankees a few years ago and the New York Mets for the building of their hugely expensive stadiums. Could you tell our viewers and listeners what is the crux of the concern that you have with how the IRS is functioning? REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, in 1986, there was a change in the tax law which made it very clear that stadiums could not be using these tax-exempt bonds to construct these professional sports stadiums. The IRS had a ruling in a private letter that essentially gave the sports teams the ability to make payments in lieu of taxes, which was kind of a loophole that enabled them to get to the point of being able to participate in these tax-free financing schemes. And so, I've had a hearing where we talked to the IRS , asked them for an explanation. And from what I understand, as a result of our hearing, they're reviewing their policies to see whether or not the 1986 Tax Reform Act has actually been compromised by the decision that they made. I think that it's important to understand that we're not alleging, at this point, that there's been any kind of criminal activity. We're simply reviewing all the information that's been presented to us, so that we can determine, first of all, the discrepancies in the appraisals, secondly, the public policy issue of using tax-exempt bonds for these stadiums, and third, if there is an inflated value of this project, the implication that it has for security laws with respect to the issuance of the tremendous amount of bond financing. JUAN GONZALEZ : I'd like ask Bettina Damiani from Good Jobs New York, this whole issue of this thing called \"PILOTs,\" or payments in lieu of taxes, for use of repaying these tax-exempt bonds, is a very complicated issue that most the general public doesn't understand. Your organization has been in the forefront of questioning these kinds of development deals by New York, but also, by extension, by many municipalities around the country. Could you break down how these PILOTs work generally? BETTINA DAMIANI : Certainly. And it's not just the average New Yorker, as we learned through the Yankee Stadium project. Most New York City and New York State elected officials don't quite understand the issue of PILOTs, which is part of the crux of this issue. Essentially, PILOTs are payments in lieu of taxes. Instead of paying taxes, the Yankees are paying back their tax-free bonds. So, there's money that should be going into, as Assembly member Brodsky mentioned, the pot of money that would help pay for roads and schools and other services that New York City needs. Instead, it's just going - it's being completely diverted. And this, unfortunately, is a policy that is not done just with the Yankees but with a variety of other very large financial firms that have managed to make a special deal with New York City. JUAN GONZALEZ : And in this particular case, it was actually in the interest of the New York Yankees to have a very high assessment of their land, because that would allow them to be able to float more bonds and pay more PILOTs, which is their main goal here, is to raise as much money as possible to build their stadium, right? BETTINA DAMIANI : Exactly, and that's the irony. And that's one of the things that you mentioned in your article yesterday, is that in the South Bronx, the city was trying desperately to inflate the value of property, but not to benefit the larger community or the people that live in the neighborhood, but really for the sole benefit of the New York Yankees. JUAN GONZALEZ : And, Neil deMause, you've been writing now for quite a while about these stadium boondoggles. Virtually every major city in America is building a new arena or a new stadium of one kind, and most of them are using some degree or other of public financing. Could you give us a sense of the overall national picture? NEIL DEMAUSE : Sure. I mean, I think it's absolutely correct that every major and minor city is either building a stadium or arena or being asked to estimate somewhere around $2 billion a year of public money going into these buildings, a very, very small percentage of which comes back in terms of, you know, tax benefits or actually benefits to the cities. You know, when the Yankees and the Mets first announced their deals, Mayor Bloomberg said, \"Oh, you know, we don't make subsidies; we make investments, and we get our money back.\" At the time, it was announced, well, the Yankees and Mets are going to be paying for, you know, all the construction costs of the stadium. As you look at it and break down where they're getting tax breaks and where they're getting sort of hidden subsidies, the taxpayers wind up paying most of the cost. JUAN GONZALEZ : And, Congressman Kucinich, you originally had scheduled your hearing for this week but then decided to postpone it until September. Have you been in conversations with the City of New York and with the Yankees about them also testifying at your hearing? And what documents, specifically, are you trying to get from them now? REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, I could say that my subcommittee staff - and again, I'm the chair of the Domestic Policy Subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over this matter - and our subcommittee staff is in contact with officials of both the City of New York and the New York Yankees to discuss their potential appearance in front of our congressional subcommittee. I think that it's very important to understand that we're looking at a public policy matter here that relates not only to New York and not only to the Nets and the Atlantic Yard project, but it also relates to the whole country, as your other guests have said, because it's quite possible that there are billions of dollars in tax benefits that should be going to municipalities for the purposes of repairing their infrastructure and for schools and other things and that are instead being diverted for these private sports complexes. And the question is one of public policy, one of the IRS , and in the case of the New York Yankees, questions of securities law, because of the various amounts of the appraisal, $45 a square foot versus $275 a square foot, which have a bearing on the overall cost of the project. And if the cost of the project is inflated, that's going to be of interest to the SEC , as well as the IRS . JUAN GONZALEZ : And in terms of the - you're not, at this point, contemplating subpoenaing any records. You're figuring that they are going to be - they will provide you the documents and the information that you requested to avoid that potential. REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, you know, we generally assume that we'll get cooperation. I mean, certainly, as an investigative subcommittee, if we need to enforce that request with a subpoena, we have the ability to apply for that. But we're not at that point yet. And, you know, we're hopeful for cooperation on the part of all the parties involved. And I think that, again, this is a matter of serious public policy. When you have New York City, a great American city, which has all these capital infrastructure needs, and when payments get diverted, essentially - payments are not going into areas where the city expects the tax revenues will be coming from, and instead they're diverted in these payments in lieu of taxes, they're intensely serious matters that need to be discussed. And so, that's why the work that Mr. Brodsky is doing and your other guests are involved in is very significant. We're going to continue with our work on the Domestic Policy Subcommittee, and we'll be sure to keep you posted. JUAN GONZALEZ : OK. We're talking with Congressman Dennis Kucinich in Washington, and here also, Bettina Damiani of Good Jobs New York and Neil deMause, the author of Field of Schemes . We're going to return in a minute and to continue the conversation. And before Congressman Kucinich leaves, we also want to ask him about the hearings in Congress, the potential impeachment hearings. We'll be back in a minute. [break] JUAN GONZALEZ : We're talking about the use of public subsidies for sports stadiums. We're joined from Washington, D.C. by Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich. And here in New York, we have Bettina Damiani, the project director of Good Jobs New York, and Neil deMause, author of Field of Schemes: How the Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money into Private Profit . But, Congressman Kucinich, you've been leading the fight for impeachment, and I know you have to go very soon, so I wanted to ask you about an interview with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that aired on The View earlier this week. She was asked about impeachment. JOY BEHAR : You've ruled against impeaching George Bush and Dick Cheney, and now Kucinich is trying to pass that. Why do you insist on not impeaching these people, so that the world and America can really see the crimes that they've committed? REP . NANCY PELOSI : Well, I think that it - I think it was important, when I became Speaker - and it's, by the way, a very important position - President, Vice President, Speaker of the House - I saw it as my responsibility to try to bring a much divided country together to the extent that we could. I thought that impeachment would be divisive for the country. In terms of what we wanted - set out to do, we wanted to raise the minimum wage, give the biggest increase in veterans benefits to veterans in the seventy-seven-year history, then pass research for stem cell research, all of that. This week, we're going to pass equal pay for equal work. It has been a long time in coming - pay equity. We're going to pass legislations for product safety, for toys that children put in their - there's an agenda that you have to get done. You have to try to do it in a bipartisan way. The President has to sign it. If somebody had a crime that the President had committed, that would be a different story. JOY BEHAR : Can they still do it after he's out? BARBARA WALTERS : When we - when I interviewed you last year, you had just begun, and you were going to clean up the mess, remember? REP . NANCY PELOSI : And we did. BARBARA WALTERS : You look around this country, 75 percent of the country - forget George Bush - thinks that Congress is doing a lousy job. ELISABETH HASSELBECK : I think it's 91 percent now. REP . NANCY PELOSI : Well, I don't disagree with that, because largely it's predicated on ending the war in Iraq. That's the main question, and we were not successful. In our House of Representatives, I'm very proud of our members, because they voted overwhelmingly over and over again to bring the war to an end, bring the troops home safely and soon, sent it to the Senate, and it hits a dead end. But in terms of that particular standard, I would say I disapprove, as well. But we do - we passed some of the things I just mentioned, the energy bill. We worked in a bipartisan way, Innovation Agenda. We have to create jobs, expand healthcare, protect the American people and educate our children. And you can't do that if you're trying to impeach the President at the same time, unless you have the goods that this president committed crimes. JUAN GONZALEZ : That was House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Congressman Kucinich, your response to her take on the situation with impeachment? REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, now that I've heard that the Speaker is looking for evidence that crimes may have been committed, I certainly want to direct her attention to the thirty-five articles of impeachment that I presented, which assert quite directly that crimes have been committed, including taking this nation into a war, an illegal war, based on lies; including the deaths of over a million innocent Iraqis, which constitute a war crime; including wiretapping, rendition, torture, illegal detention. There are many examples of laws that have been broken. And the reason why the Judiciary Committee should hold a hearing on the impeachment itself is because there needs to be a public airing of this. So, I have a great deal of respect for Speaker Pelosi, and I think that since she made that statement on The View , there's an opportunity now for us to come forward and to lay all the facts out so that she can reconsider her decision not to permit the Judiciary Committee to proceed with a full impeachment hearing.

It's being taken seriously.

And then, whether or not it results in the President being removed from office before the end of his term is another matter. I want to further say that with the possibility of a war in Iran in the offing, a war against Iran, a war that would be a result of a pre-emptive attack, much like the one that the United States launched against Iraq, it becomes very important that we hold this administration to the highest standard of having to verify the statements they make to take us into one war and to try to take us into another.

Site consultants are prevalent throughout the country that have really manufactured this process, and they make it seem like if the Yankees didn't get their subsidy or if the New York Stock Exchange didn't get a subsidy, they were going to flee somewhere else, without taking into consideration or doing some real due diligence. Where were the Yankees going to go? The Yankees are famous because they're in the Bronx. We have a large media here. We have an incredible fan base here. And it seems none of that was taken in consideration before this huge giveaway was done. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, that's one of the things I think Assembly member Brodsky is trying to investigate, because the city agency that engineered this deal, the Industrial Development Authority, apparently said that the Yankees were threatening to leave New York, of course, the most expensive media market in the country, the most desirable media market in the country. Neil, your sense of whether that was real or not? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah, I mean, and I think everyone knows that the Yankees were not going to move out of New York City, and it's kind of been an open secret for decades now, as long as George Steinbrenner has been demanding a stadium. Where is he going to go? The Yankees are not worth the, whatever, billion dollars that they're worth if they move to Charlotte, North Carolina. But that was the pretense. And the Yankees actually told the judge in a case trying to stop the demolition of the parks, \"Well, if you try and hold up this case, the Yankees could move.\" And, you know, they've been allowed to get away with this. And as Bettina was saying, elected officials never challenged them on this, until, you know, recently Brodsky is trying - been trying to track it down. JUAN GONZALEZ : And, of course, the final irony of all of this is, in the new stadium, once it gets built, as with all these stadiums, the ticket prices for the average baseball fan go through the roof. The prices in Yankee Stadium for box seats now are astronomical -- they're astronomical now, but what they will cost in the new stadium is unbelievable. Could you talk about some of the prices that they've released so far? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah. I mean, they're talking over, you know, $1,000, $2,000 a seat for some of the really premium seats. And I think what you're going to see is -- JUAN GONZALEZ : For one game? NEIL DEMAUSE : For one game, yes. For one game, yes, absolutely. For a whole season, you know, all bets are off. But I think, you know, what you're going to see the Yankees do, they've promised to keep bleacher tickets low. They've promised to keep a certain number of, you know, $25-or-less seats. I think what you're going to see them do is, especially with Brodsky and everyone else paying attention to the soaring costs, I think you're going to see the Yankees keep ticket prices low for the first season or two and, you know, try to say, \"OK, we're holding the line.\" And then, as everybody's clamoring to get tickets, two, three years down the road, you'll see those start to creep up. So, what I'm worried about isn't, next year, is it going to be affordable, but three years from now, is anybody going to be able to get a ticket? JUAN GONZALEZ : Right. And then, of course, the final irony with - because most of these stadiums have luxury boxes that are for corporations that go from $500,000 to $800,000, in the case of the Yankees, per year to rent these boxes, and of course, my newspaper, the Daily News , reported yesterday that in this deal, the City of New York arranged to have its own luxury box at Yankee Stadium available, presumably to city officials, as part of the deal for the financing. Bettina, your response to that? BETTINA DAMIANI : It's aptly coined the landlord suite. And it's just another example of how local elected officials almost seem to be void of feeling that they have responsibility to the public, because they're going to get nice seats, in the long run. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, I want to thank both of you for being with us, Bettina Damiani, the project director of Good Jobs New York, and Neil deMause, who's a writer and the author of Field of Schemes: How the Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money into Private Profit .\n\nI'd like to begin with Congressman Kucinich. You have, as of last week, made a request to the City of New York and to the New York Yankees for a variety of documents as part of your continuing investigation into possible abuses of federal laws and IRS regulations relating to these kind of stadium projects. Could you tell us what you're trying to do with that investigation and why you decided to focus in on New York and the Yankees? REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, this is a project that's imminent, and we have - the thing that I think, you know, caught my attention is when you have an independent appraisal of the land that the Yankees want to get for their new stadium of $45 per square foot, and yet the city had an appraisal that appraised the same land at $275 a square foot. Now, what our committee is trying to find out is, does the city's assessment represent a deliberate inflation of the value of the land so that there would be a greater number of tax-free bonds issued, thereby raising questions of, you know, an inappropriate increased diversion of federal tax monies for this kind of private project. JUAN GONZALEZ : Now, you have been, for now several months, actually, questioning the IRS about the original waiver, in essence, that they gave the Yankees a few years ago and the New York Mets for the building of their hugely expensive stadiums. Could you tell our viewers and listeners what is the crux of the concern that you have with how the IRS is functioning? REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, in 1986, there was a change in the tax law which made it very clear that stadiums could not be using these tax-exempt bonds to construct these professional sports stadiums. The IRS had a ruling in a private letter that essentially gave the sports teams the ability to make payments in lieu of taxes, which was kind of a loophole that enabled them to get to the point of being able to participate in these tax-free financing schemes. And so, I've had a hearing where we talked to the IRS , asked them for an explanation. And from what I understand, as a result of our hearing, they're reviewing their policies to see whether or not the 1986 Tax Reform Act has actually been compromised by the decision that they made. I think that it's important to understand that we're not alleging, at this point, that there's been any kind of criminal activity. We're simply reviewing all the information that's been presented to us, so that we can determine, first of all, the discrepancies in the appraisals, secondly, the public policy issue of using tax-exempt bonds for these stadiums, and third, if there is an inflated value of this project, the implication that it has for security laws with respect to the issuance of the tremendous amount of bond financing. JUAN GONZALEZ : I'd like ask Bettina Damiani from Good Jobs New York, this whole issue of this thing called \"PILOTs,\" or payments in lieu of taxes, for use of repaying these tax-exempt bonds, is a very complicated issue that most the general public doesn't understand. Your organization has been in the forefront of questioning these kinds of development deals by New York, but also, by extension, by many municipalities around the country. Could you break down how these PILOTs work generally? BETTINA DAMIANI : Certainly. And it's not just the average New Yorker, as we learned through the Yankee Stadium project. Most New York City and New York State elected officials don't quite understand the issue of PILOTs, which is part of the crux of this issue. Essentially, PILOTs are payments in lieu of taxes. Instead of paying taxes, the Yankees are paying back their tax-free bonds. So, there's money that should be going into, as Assembly member Brodsky mentioned, the pot of money that would help pay for roads and schools and other services that New York City needs. Instead, it's just going - it's being completely diverted. And this, unfortunately, is a policy that is not done just with the Yankees but with a variety of other very large financial firms that have managed to make a special deal with New York City. JUAN GONZALEZ : And in this particular case, it was actually in the interest of the New York Yankees to have a very high assessment of their land, because that would allow them to be able to float more bonds and pay more PILOTs, which is their main goal here, is to raise as much money as possible to build their stadium, right? BETTINA DAMIANI : Exactly, and that's the irony. And that's one of the things that you mentioned in your article yesterday, is that in the South Bronx, the city was trying desperately to inflate the value of property, but not to benefit the larger community or the people that live in the neighborhood, but really for the sole benefit of the New York Yankees. JUAN GONZALEZ : And, Neil deMause, you've been writing now for quite a while about these stadium boondoggles. Virtually every major city in America is building a new arena or a new stadium of one kind, and most of them are using some degree or other of public financing. Could you give us a sense of the overall national picture? NEIL DEMAUSE : Sure. I mean, I think it's absolutely correct that every major and minor city is either building a stadium or arena or being asked to estimate somewhere around $2 billion a year of public money going into these buildings, a very, very small percentage of which comes back in terms of, you know, tax benefits or actually benefits to the cities. You know, when the Yankees and the Mets first announced their deals, Mayor Bloomberg said, \"Oh, you know, we don't make subsidies; we make investments, and we get our money back.\" At the time, it was announced, well, the Yankees and Mets are going to be paying for, you know, all the construction costs of the stadium. As you look at it and break down where they're getting tax breaks and where they're getting sort of hidden subsidies, the taxpayers wind up paying most of the cost. JUAN GONZALEZ : And, Congressman Kucinich, you originally had scheduled your hearing for this week but then decided to postpone it until September. Have you been in conversations with the City of New York and with the Yankees about them also testifying at your hearing? And what documents, specifically, are you trying to get from them now? REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, I could say that my subcommittee staff - and again, I'm the chair of the Domestic Policy Subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over this matter - and our subcommittee staff is in contact with officials of both the City of New York and the New York Yankees to discuss their potential appearance in front of our congressional subcommittee. I think that it's very important to understand that we're looking at a public policy matter here that relates not only to New York and not only to the Nets and the Atlantic Yard project, but it also relates to the whole country, as your other guests have said, because it's quite possible that there are billions of dollars in tax benefits that should be going to municipalities for the purposes of repairing their infrastructure and for schools and other things and that are instead being diverted for these private sports complexes. And the question is one of public policy, one of the IRS , and in the case of the New York Yankees, questions of securities law, because of the various amounts of the appraisal, $45 a square foot versus $275 a square foot, which have a bearing on the overall cost of the project. And if the cost of the project is inflated, that's going to be of interest to the SEC , as well as the IRS . JUAN GONZALEZ : And in terms of the - you're not, at this point, contemplating subpoenaing any records. You're figuring that they are going to be - they will provide you the documents and the information that you requested to avoid that potential. REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, you know, we generally assume that we'll get cooperation. I mean, certainly, as an investigative subcommittee, if we need to enforce that request with a subpoena, we have the ability to apply for that. But we're not at that point yet. And, you know, we're hopeful for cooperation on the part of all the parties involved. And I think that, again, this is a matter of serious public policy. When you have New York City, a great American city, which has all these capital infrastructure needs, and when payments get diverted, essentially - payments are not going into areas where the city expects the tax revenues will be coming from, and instead they're diverted in these payments in lieu of taxes, they're intensely serious matters that need to be discussed. And so, that's why the work that Mr. Brodsky is doing and your other guests are involved in is very significant. We're going to continue with our work on the Domestic Policy Subcommittee, and we'll be sure to keep you posted. JUAN GONZALEZ : OK. We're talking with Congressman Dennis Kucinich in Washington, and here also, Bettina Damiani of Good Jobs New York and Neil deMause, the author of Field of Schemes . We're going to return in a minute and to continue the conversation. And before Congressman Kucinich leaves, we also want to ask him about the hearings in Congress, the potential impeachment hearings. We'll be back in a minute. [break] JUAN GONZALEZ : We're talking about the use of public subsidies for sports stadiums. We're joined from Washington, D.C. by Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich. And here in New York, we have Bettina Damiani, the project director of Good Jobs New York, and Neil deMause, author of Field of Schemes: How the Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money into Private Profit . But, Congressman Kucinich, you've been leading the fight for impeachment, and I know you have to go very soon, so I wanted to ask you about an interview with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that aired on The View earlier this week. She was asked about impeachment. JOY BEHAR : You've ruled against impeaching George Bush and Dick Cheney, and now Kucinich is trying to pass that. Why do you insist on not impeaching these people, so that the world and America can really see the crimes that they've committed? REP . NANCY PELOSI : Well, I think that it - I think it was important, when I became Speaker - and it's, by the way, a very important position - President, Vice President, Speaker of the House - I saw it as my responsibility to try to bring a much divided country together to the extent that we could. I thought that impeachment would be divisive for the country. In terms of what we wanted - set out to do, we wanted to raise the minimum wage, give the biggest increase in veterans benefits to veterans in the seventy-seven-year history, then pass research for stem cell research, all of that. This week, we're going to pass equal pay for equal work. It has been a long time in coming - pay equity. We're going to pass legislations for product safety, for toys that children put in their - there's an agenda that you have to get done. You have to try to do it in a bipartisan way. The President has to sign it. If somebody had a crime that the President had committed, that would be a different story. JOY BEHAR : Can they still do it after he's out? BARBARA WALTERS : When we - when I interviewed you last year, you had just begun, and you were going to clean up the mess, remember? REP . NANCY PELOSI : And we did. BARBARA WALTERS : You look around this country, 75 percent of the country - forget George Bush - thinks that Congress is doing a lousy job. ELISABETH HASSELBECK : I think it's 91 percent now. REP . NANCY PELOSI : Well, I don't disagree with that, because largely it's predicated on ending the war in Iraq. That's the main question, and we were not successful. In our House of Representatives, I'm very proud of our members, because they voted overwhelmingly over and over again to bring the war to an end, bring the troops home safely and soon, sent it to the Senate, and it hits a dead end. But in terms of that particular standard, I would say I disapprove, as well. But we do - we passed some of the things I just mentioned, the energy bill. We worked in a bipartisan way, Innovation Agenda. We have to create jobs, expand healthcare, protect the American people and educate our children. And you can't do that if you're trying to impeach the President at the same time, unless you have the goods that this president committed crimes. JUAN GONZALEZ : That was House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Congressman Kucinich, your response to her take on the situation with impeachment? REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, now that I've heard that the Speaker is looking for evidence that crimes may have been committed, I certainly want to direct her attention to the thirty-five articles of impeachment that I presented, which assert quite directly that crimes have been committed, including taking this nation into a war, an illegal war, based on lies; including the deaths of over a million innocent Iraqis, which constitute a war crime; including wiretapping, rendition, torture, illegal detention. There are many examples of laws that have been broken. And the reason why the Judiciary Committee should hold a hearing on the impeachment itself is because there needs to be a public airing of this. So, I have a great deal of respect for Speaker Pelosi, and I think that since she made that statement on The View , there's an opportunity now for us to come forward and to lay all the facts out so that she can reconsider her decision not to permit the Judiciary Committee to proceed with a full impeachment hearing. I just want to state this, that I appreciate that she consented to a hearing on Friday. It was a six-hour hearing, over a dozen witnesses. Twenty-four members of Congress attended. It's being taken seriously. I think the idea that nothing can be done right now because we're on the eve of an election raises questions about our constitutional responsibility to be a check and balance to administration abuse of power. If in fact we're in a war that's based on lies, and we have thousands of troops whose lives are on the line every day, we owe it to them and we owe it to the American people to set straight the public record. And then, whether or not it results in the President being removed from office before the end of his term is another matter. I want to further say that with the possibility of a war in Iran in the offing, a war against Iran, a war that would be a result of a pre-emptive attack, much like the one that the United States launched against Iraq, it becomes very important that we hold this administration to the highest standard of having to verify the statements they make to take us into one war and to try to take us into another. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, Congressman Dennis Kucinich of Ohio, thank you, once again, for joining us. And we're going to continue the conversation here on the stadium issues with Bettina Damiani of Good Jobs New York and Neil deMause, author of Field of Schemes . I'd like to - again, getting back to the stadium deal, this Yankee Stadium is the most expensive stadium in the history of the United States. The actual cost is very hard to get your hands around, because there are some public infrastructure subsidies. But we're talking about a stadium that is going to be somewhere between one and two billion dollars, when you add up all of the actual costs, probably closer to two. And, Neil, could you talk about this - how the public expenditures are being used, even though we're being told that they're not being - public money is not being used directly for the stadium? NEIL DEMAUSE : Sure. I mean, it's something I've been trying to track ever since this was first announced three years ago. There is, as you mentioned, this infrastructure cost, where the public is paying for building new parks to replace the ones that were torn down to make way for the new stadium, paying for moving a water main and other things like that. JUAN GONZALEZ : And when you say parks that were torn down, because that was, itself, a big issue -- NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah, this -- JUAN GONZALEZ : - this is public park land, about a - what was it? Twenty acres or at least -- NEIL DEMAUSE : It was like twenty-two acres that was actually demolished. It was park that had been there even longer than Yankee Stadium that was demolished to make way for the new stadium. To make up for this, the city and state had to make sure that there was an equal amount of park land that was created. So they're knocking down the old stadium completely. Originally, the team was talking, \"Oh, we're going to save it as a museum.\" It's going to be gone starting next year, and they're going to put some ball fields there. And they've found some space down by the Harlem River where they're going to squeeze in some tennis courts, and sort of little patchwork of parks around different places. The public is paying for all that. The public is paying for the actual demolition of Yankee Stadium, is all going to be public. The public is paying a good chunk for building new parking garages for the Yankees, including one that will be used by the players and VIPs and various folks like that. And the team is getting all sorts of different tax breaks. As Bettina mentioned, they're not going to be paying property taxes. They're going to be getting mortgage-recording taxes. They're going to be getting these tax-exempt bonds that we've been talking about, which is actually a tremendous amount of money, if they get the new $300 million in bonds they're looking for. They're going to be talking about getting more than $300 million worth of tax breaks just on the bonds themselves. So when you add it all up, you get somewhere around $900 million worth of public money that's being spent just on Yankee Stadium. JUAN GONZALEZ : Bettina, those who advocate these stadiums say, \"Why not? This is economic development. It's creating jobs. It's keeping a sort of a -- the psychology of the city by having a professional sports team that the residents can root for.\" What's wrong with it? BETTINA DAMIANI : All the subsidies that Neil just listed. You would like to assume that the city and the state made a clear path to making sure that there were going to be jobs, good-paying jobs for New Yorkers, on the other end. That was going to be the investment, right? We see nothing. There's nothing that says a certain number of jobs has to be set aside for either local New York residents or local Bronx residents, or the number of jobs at all. The city has really washed their hands of making sure there's any accountability on jobs and clear benefits for New Yorkers on the other side of this project, which is very unfortunate. I mean, we're grateful for Congressman Kucinich and Assembly member Brodsky to get involved in this issue. Neither represent New York City, by the way. New York City elected officials - they're filling a void, because local elected officials in New York City have refused to get involved in this project. And we need them. We need them to make sure that the promises in the press releases actually turn out to be something that we can hold them accountable for. JUAN GONZALEZ : And you have, generally speaking, on this issue of tax-exempt financing for economic development, raised numerous questions over the years. It's been one of my favorite topics, how cities are siphoning off their tax bases to create special deals for developers, whether it's sports teams or private companies, where they're, in essence, siphoning off the existing tax base from the municipal government and using it to fund special projects. How rampant is this, not only in New York, but throughout the country? BETTINA DAMIANI : It's a terrible issue regarding not only the issue of financing, but making sure that there are quality jobs for Americans and, in our case, New Yorkers. There's a thing called the economic war among the states, where it seems that so many municipalities and states are worried about fighting one another for the headquarters of a particular agency that they're willing to set aside basic fiscal commonsense and not making sure that there are real quality jobs on the ends of these big deals. Site consultants are prevalent throughout the country that have really manufactured this process, and they make it seem like if the Yankees didn't get their subsidy or if the New York Stock Exchange didn't get a subsidy, they were going to flee somewhere else, without taking into consideration or doing some real due diligence. Where were the Yankees going to go? The Yankees are famous because they're in the Bronx. We have a large media here. We have an incredible fan base here. And it seems none of that was taken in consideration before this huge giveaway was done. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, that's one of the things I think Assembly member Brodsky is trying to investigate, because the city agency that engineered this deal, the Industrial Development Authority, apparently said that the Yankees were threatening to leave New York, of course, the most expensive media market in the country, the most desirable media market in the country. Neil, your sense of whether that was real or not? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah, I mean, and I think everyone knows that the Yankees were not going to move out of New York City, and it's kind of been an open secret for decades now, as long as George Steinbrenner has been demanding a stadium. Where is he going to go? The Yankees are not worth the, whatever, billion dollars that they're worth if they move to Charlotte, North Carolina. But that was the pretense. And the Yankees actually told the judge in a case trying to stop the demolition of the parks, \"Well, if you try and hold up this case, the Yankees could move.\" And, you know, they've been allowed to get away with this. And as Bettina was saying, elected officials never challenged them on this, until, you know, recently Brodsky is trying - been trying to track it down.

Could you talk about some of the prices that they've released so far? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah. I mean, they're talking over, you know, $1,000, $2,000 a seat for some of the really premium seats. And I think what you're going to see is -- JUAN GONZALEZ : For one game? NEIL DEMAUSE : For one game, yes. For one game, yes, absolutely. For a whole season, you know, all bets are off. But I think, you know, what you're going to see the Yankees do, they've promised to keep bleacher tickets low. They've promised to keep a certain number of, you know, $25-or-less seats. I think what you're going to see them do is, especially with Brodsky and everyone else paying attention to the soaring costs, I think you're going to see the Yankees keep ticket prices low for the first season or two and, you know, try to say, \"OK, we're holding the line.\" And then, as everybody's clamoring to get tickets, two, three years down the road, you'll see those start to creep up. So, what I'm worried about isn't, next year, is it going to be affordable, but three years from now, is anybody going to be able to get a ticket? JUAN GONZALEZ : Right. And then, of course, the final irony with - because most of these stadiums have luxury boxes that are for corporations that go from $500,000 to $800,000, in the case of the Yankees, per year to rent these boxes, and of course, my newspaper, the Daily News , reported yesterday that in this deal, the City of New York arranged to have its own luxury box at Yankee Stadium available, presumably to city officials, as part of the deal for the financing.

DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, I could say that my subcommittee staff - and again, I'm the chair of the Domestic Policy Subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over this matter - and our subcommittee staff is in contact with officials of both the City of New York and the New York Yankees to discuss their potential appearance in front of our congressional subcommittee. I think that it's very important to understand that we're looking at a public policy matter here that relates not only to New York and not only to the Nets and the Atlantic Yard project, but it also relates to the whole country, as your other guests have said, because it's quite possible that there are billions of dollars in tax benefits that should be going to municipalities for the purposes of repairing their infrastructure and for schools and other things and that are instead being diverted for these private sports complexes. And the question is one of public policy, one of the IRS , and in the case of the New York Yankees, questions of securities law, because of the various amounts of the appraisal, $45 a square foot versus $275 a square foot, which have a bearing on the overall cost of the project. And if the cost of the project is inflated, that's going to be of interest to the SEC , as well as the IRS . JUAN GONZALEZ : And in terms of the - you're not, at this point, contemplating subpoenaing any records. You're figuring that they are going to be - they will provide you the documents and the information that you requested to avoid that potential. REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, you know, we generally assume that we'll get cooperation. I mean, certainly, as an investigative subcommittee, if we need to enforce that request with a subpoena, we have the ability to apply for that. But we're not at that point yet. And, you know, we're hopeful for cooperation on the part of all the parties involved. And I think that, again, this is a matter of serious public policy. When you have New York City, a great American city, which has all these capital infrastructure needs, and when payments get diverted, essentially - payments are not going into areas where the city expects the tax revenues will be coming from, and instead they're diverted in these payments in lieu of taxes, they're intensely serious matters that need to be discussed. And so, that's why the work that Mr. Brodsky is doing and your other guests are involved in is very significant. We're going to continue with our work on the Domestic Policy Subcommittee, and we'll be sure to keep you posted. JUAN GONZALEZ : OK. We're talking with Congressman Dennis Kucinich in Washington, and here also, Bettina Damiani of Good Jobs New York and Neil deMause, the author of Field of Schemes . We're going to return in a minute and to continue the conversation. And before Congressman Kucinich leaves, we also want to ask him about the hearings in Congress, the potential impeachment hearings. We'll be back in a minute. [break] JUAN GONZALEZ : We're talking about the use of public subsidies for sports stadiums. We're joined from Washington, D.C. by Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich. And here in New York, we have Bettina Damiani, the project director of Good Jobs New York, and Neil deMause, author of Field of Schemes: How the Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money into Private Profit . But, Congressman Kucinich, you've been leading the fight for impeachment, and I know you have to go very soon, so I wanted to ask you about an interview with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that aired on The View earlier this week. She was asked about impeachment. JOY BEHAR : You've ruled against impeaching George Bush and Dick Cheney, and now Kucinich is trying to pass that. Why do you insist on not impeaching these people, so that the world and America can really see the crimes that they've committed? REP . NANCY PELOSI : Well, I think that it - I think it was important, when I became Speaker - and it's, by the way, a very important position - President, Vice President, Speaker of the House - I saw it as my responsibility to try to bring a much divided country together to the extent that we could. I thought that impeachment would be divisive for the country. In terms of what we wanted - set out to do, we wanted to raise the minimum wage, give the biggest increase in veterans benefits to veterans in the seventy-seven-year history, then pass research for stem cell research, all of that. This week, we're going to pass equal pay for equal work. It has been a long time in coming - pay equity. We're going to pass legislations for product safety, for toys that children put in their - there's an agenda that you have to get done. You have to try to do it in a bipartisan way. The President has to sign it. If somebody had a crime that the President had committed, that would be a different story. JOY BEHAR : Can they still do it after he's out? BARBARA WALTERS : When we - when I interviewed you last year, you had just begun, and you were going to clean up the mess, remember? REP . NANCY PELOSI : And we did. BARBARA WALTERS : You look around this country, 75 percent of the country - forget George Bush - thinks that Congress is doing a lousy job. ELISABETH HASSELBECK : I think it's 91 percent now. REP . NANCY PELOSI : Well, I don't disagree with that, because largely it's predicated on ending the war in Iraq. That's the main question, and we were not successful. In our House of Representatives, I'm very proud of our members, because they voted overwhelmingly over and over again to bring the war to an end, bring the troops home safely and soon, sent it to the Senate, and it hits a dead end. But in terms of that particular standard, I would say I disapprove, as well. But we do - we passed some of the things I just mentioned, the energy bill. We worked in a bipartisan way, Innovation Agenda. We have to create jobs, expand healthcare, protect the American people and educate our children. And you can't do that if you're trying to impeach the President at the same time, unless you have the goods that this president committed crimes. JUAN GONZALEZ : That was House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Congressman Kucinich, your response to her take on the situation with impeachment? REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, now that I've heard that the Speaker is looking for evidence that crimes may have been committed, I certainly want to direct her attention to the thirty-five articles of impeachment that I presented, which assert quite directly that crimes have been committed, including taking this nation into a war, an illegal war, based on lies; including the deaths of over a million innocent Iraqis, which constitute a war crime; including wiretapping, rendition, torture, illegal detention. There are many examples of laws that have been broken. And the reason why the Judiciary Committee should hold a hearing on the impeachment itself is because there needs to be a public airing of this. So, I have a great deal of respect for Speaker Pelosi, and I think that since she made that statement on The View , there's an opportunity now for us to come forward and to lay all the facts out so that she can reconsider her decision not to permit the Judiciary Committee to proceed with a full impeachment hearing. I just want to state this, that I appreciate that she consented to a hearing on Friday. It was a six-hour hearing, over a dozen witnesses. Twenty-four members of Congress attended. It's being taken seriously. I think the idea that nothing can be done right now because we're on the eve of an election raises questions about our constitutional responsibility to be a check and balance to administration abuse of power. If in fact we're in a war that's based on lies, and we have thousands of troops whose lives are on the line every day, we owe it to them and we owe it to the American people to set straight the public record. And then, whether or not it results in the President being removed from office before the end of his term is another matter. I want to further say that with the possibility of a war in Iran in the offing, a war against Iran, a war that would be a result of a pre-emptive attack, much like the one that the United States launched against Iraq, it becomes very important that we hold this administration to the highest standard of having to verify the statements they make to take us into one war and to try to take us into another. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, Congressman Dennis Kucinich of Ohio, thank you, once again, for joining us. And we're going to continue the conversation here on the stadium issues with Bettina Damiani of Good Jobs New York and Neil deMause, author of Field of Schemes . I'd like to - again, getting back to the stadium deal, this Yankee Stadium is the most expensive stadium in the history of the United States. The actual cost is very hard to get your hands around, because there are some public infrastructure subsidies. But we're talking about a stadium that is going to be somewhere between one and two billion dollars, when you add up all of the actual costs, probably closer to two. And, Neil, could you talk about this - how the public expenditures are being used, even though we're being told that they're not being - public money is not being used directly for the stadium? NEIL DEMAUSE : Sure. I mean, it's something I've been trying to track ever since this was first announced three years ago. There is, as you mentioned, this infrastructure cost, where the public is paying for building new parks to replace the ones that were torn down to make way for the new stadium, paying for moving a water main and other things like that. JUAN GONZALEZ : And when you say parks that were torn down, because that was, itself, a big issue -- NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah, this -- JUAN GONZALEZ : - this is public park land, about a - what was it? Twenty acres or at least -- NEIL DEMAUSE : It was like twenty-two acres that was actually demolished. It was park that had been there even longer than Yankee Stadium that was demolished to make way for the new stadium. To make up for this, the city and state had to make sure that there was an equal amount of park land that was created. So they're knocking down the old stadium completely. Originally, the team was talking, \"Oh, we're going to save it as a museum.\" It's going to be gone starting next year, and they're going to put some ball fields there. And they've found some space down by the Harlem River where they're going to squeeze in some tennis courts, and sort of little patchwork of parks around different places. The public is paying for all that. The public is paying for the actual demolition of Yankee Stadium, is all going to be public. The public is paying a good chunk for building new parking garages for the Yankees, including one that will be used by the players and VIPs and various folks like that. And the team is getting all sorts of different tax breaks. As Bettina mentioned, they're not going to be paying property taxes. They're going to be getting mortgage-recording taxes. They're going to be getting these tax-exempt bonds that we've been talking about, which is actually a tremendous amount of money, if they get the new $300 million in bonds they're looking for. They're going to be talking about getting more than $300 million worth of tax breaks just on the bonds themselves. So when you add it all up, you get somewhere around $900 million worth of public money that's being spent just on Yankee Stadium. JUAN GONZALEZ : Bettina, those who advocate these stadiums say, \"Why not? This is economic development. It's creating jobs. It's keeping a sort of a -- the psychology of the city by having a professional sports team that the residents can root for.\" What's wrong with it? BETTINA DAMIANI : All the subsidies that Neil just listed. You would like to assume that the city and the state made a clear path to making sure that there were going to be jobs, good-paying jobs for New Yorkers, on the other end. That was going to be the investment, right? We see nothing. There's nothing that says a certain number of jobs has to be set aside for either local New York residents or local Bronx residents, or the number of jobs at all. The city has really washed their hands of making sure there's any accountability on jobs and clear benefits for New Yorkers on the other side of this project, which is very unfortunate. I mean, we're grateful for Congressman Kucinich and Assembly member Brodsky to get involved in this issue. Neither represent New York City, by the way. New York City elected officials - they're filling a void, because local elected officials in New York City have refused to get involved in this project. And we need them. We need them to make sure that the promises in the press releases actually turn out to be something that we can hold them accountable for. JUAN GONZALEZ : And you have, generally speaking, on this issue of tax-exempt financing for economic development, raised numerous questions over the years. It's been one of my favorite topics, how cities are siphoning off their tax bases to create special deals for developers, whether it's sports teams or private companies, where they're, in essence, siphoning off the existing tax base from the municipal government and using it to fund special projects. How rampant is this, not only in New York, but throughout the country? BETTINA DAMIANI : It's a terrible issue regarding not only the issue of financing, but making sure that there are quality jobs for Americans and, in our case, New Yorkers. There's a thing called the economic war among the states, where it seems that so many municipalities and states are worried about fighting one another for the headquarters of a particular agency that they're willing to set aside basic fiscal commonsense and not making sure that there are real quality jobs on the ends of these big deals. Site consultants are prevalent throughout the country that have really manufactured this process, and they make it seem like if the Yankees didn't get their subsidy or if the New York Stock Exchange didn't get a subsidy, they were going to flee somewhere else, without taking into consideration or doing some real due diligence. Where were the Yankees going to go? The Yankees are famous because they're in the Bronx. We have a large media here. We have an incredible fan base here. And it seems none of that was taken in consideration before this huge giveaway was done. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, that's one of the things I think Assembly member Brodsky is trying to investigate, because the city agency that engineered this deal, the Industrial Development Authority, apparently said that the Yankees were threatening to leave New York, of course, the most expensive media market in the country, the most desirable media market in the country. Neil, your sense of whether that was real or not? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah, I mean, and I think everyone knows that the Yankees were not going to move out of New York City, and it's kind of been an open secret for decades now, as long as George Steinbrenner has been demanding a stadium. Where is he going to go? The Yankees are not worth the, whatever, billion dollars that they're worth if they move to Charlotte, North Carolina. But that was the pretense. And the Yankees actually told the judge in a case trying to stop the demolition of the parks, \"Well, if you try and hold up this case, the Yankees could move.\" And, you know, they've been allowed to get away with this. And as Bettina was saying, elected officials never challenged them on this, until, you know, recently Brodsky is trying - been trying to track it down. JUAN GONZALEZ : And, of course, the final irony of all of this is, in the new stadium, once it gets built, as with all these stadiums, the ticket prices for the average baseball fan go through the roof. The prices in Yankee Stadium for box seats now are astronomical -- they're astronomical now, but what they will cost in the new stadium is unbelievable. Could you talk about some of the prices that they've released so far? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah. I mean, they're talking over, you know, $1,000, $2,000 a seat for some of the really premium seats. And I think what you're going to see is -- JUAN GONZALEZ : For one game? NEIL DEMAUSE : For one game, yes. For one game, yes, absolutely. For a whole season, you know, all bets are off. But I think, you know, what you're going to see the Yankees do, they've promised to keep bleacher tickets low. They've promised to keep a certain number of, you know, $25-or-less seats. I think what you're going to see them do is, especially with Brodsky and everyone else paying attention to the soaring costs, I think you're going to see the Yankees keep ticket prices low for the first season or two and, you know, try to say, \"OK, we're holding the line.\" And then, as everybody's clamoring to get tickets, two, three years down the road, you'll see those start to creep up. So, what I'm worried about isn't, next year, is it going to be affordable, but three years from now, is anybody going to be able to get a ticket? JUAN GONZALEZ : Right. And then, of course, the final irony with - because most of these stadiums have luxury boxes that are for corporations that go from $500,000 to $800,000, in the case of the Yankees, per year to rent these boxes, and of course, my newspaper, the Daily News , reported yesterday that in this deal, the City of New York arranged to have its own luxury box at Yankee Stadium available, presumably to city officials, as part of the deal for the financing. Bettina, your response to that? BETTINA DAMIANI : It's aptly coined the landlord suite. And it's just another example of how local elected officials almost seem to be void of feeling that they have responsibility to the public, because they're going to get nice seats, in the long run. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, I want to thank both of you for being with us, Bettina Damiani, the project director of Good Jobs New York, and Neil deMause, who's a writer and the author of Field of Schemes: How the Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money into Private Profit .\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : Now, you have been, for now several months, actually, questioning the IRS about the original waiver, in essence, that they gave the Yankees a few years ago and the New York Mets for the building of their hugely expensive stadiums. Could you tell our viewers and listeners what is the crux of the concern that you have with how the IRS is functioning? REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, in 1986, there was a change in the tax law which made it very clear that stadiums could not be using these tax-exempt bonds to construct these professional sports stadiums. The IRS had a ruling in a private letter that essentially gave the sports teams the ability to make payments in lieu of taxes, which was kind of a loophole that enabled them to get to the point of being able to participate in these tax-free financing schemes. And so, I've had a hearing where we talked to the IRS , asked them for an explanation. And from what I understand, as a result of our hearing, they're reviewing their policies to see whether or not the 1986 Tax Reform Act has actually been compromised by the decision that they made. I think that it's important to understand that we're not alleging, at this point, that there's been any kind of criminal activity. We're simply reviewing all the information that's been presented to us, so that we can determine, first of all, the discrepancies in the appraisals, secondly, the public policy issue of using tax-exempt bonds for these stadiums, and third, if there is an inflated value of this project, the implication that it has for security laws with respect to the issuance of the tremendous amount of bond financing. JUAN GONZALEZ : I'd like ask Bettina Damiani from Good Jobs New York, this whole issue of this thing called \"PILOTs,\" or payments in lieu of taxes, for use of repaying these tax-exempt bonds, is a very complicated issue that most the general public doesn't understand. Your organization has been in the forefront of questioning these kinds of development deals by New York, but also, by extension, by many municipalities around the country. Could you break down how these PILOTs work generally? BETTINA DAMIANI : Certainly. And it's not just the average New Yorker, as we learned through the Yankee Stadium project. Most New York City and New York State elected officials don't quite understand the issue of PILOTs, which is part of the crux of this issue. Essentially, PILOTs are payments in lieu of taxes. Instead of paying taxes, the Yankees are paying back their tax-free bonds. So, there's money that should be going into, as Assembly member Brodsky mentioned, the pot of money that would help pay for roads and schools and other services that New York City needs. Instead, it's just going - it's being completely diverted. And this, unfortunately, is a policy that is not done just with the Yankees but with a variety of other very large financial firms that have managed to make a special deal with New York City. JUAN GONZALEZ : And in this particular case, it was actually in the interest of the New York Yankees to have a very high assessment of their land, because that would allow them to be able to float more bonds and pay more PILOTs, which is their main goal here, is to raise as much money as possible to build their stadium, right? BETTINA DAMIANI : Exactly, and that's the irony. And that's one of the things that you mentioned in your article yesterday, is that in the South Bronx, the city was trying desperately to inflate the value of property, but not to benefit the larger community or the people that live in the neighborhood, but really for the sole benefit of the New York Yankees. JUAN GONZALEZ : And, Neil deMause, you've been writing now for quite a while about these stadium boondoggles. Virtually every major city in America is building a new arena or a new stadium of one kind, and most of them are using some degree or other of public financing. Could you give us a sense of the overall national picture? NEIL DEMAUSE : Sure. I mean, I think it's absolutely correct that every major and minor city is either building a stadium or arena or being asked to estimate somewhere around $2 billion a year of public money going into these buildings, a very, very small percentage of which comes back in terms of, you know, tax benefits or actually benefits to the cities. You know, when the Yankees and the Mets first announced their deals, Mayor Bloomberg said, \"Oh, you know, we don't make subsidies; we make investments, and we get our money back.\" At the time, it was announced, well, the Yankees and Mets are going to be paying for, you know, all the construction costs of the stadium. As you look at it and break down where they're getting tax breaks and where they're getting sort of hidden subsidies, the taxpayers wind up paying most of the cost. JUAN GONZALEZ : And, Congressman Kucinich, you originally had scheduled your hearing for this week but then decided to postpone it until September. Have you been in conversations with the City of New York and with the Yankees about them also testifying at your hearing? And what documents, specifically, are you trying to get from them now? REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, I could say that my subcommittee staff - and again, I'm the chair of the Domestic Policy Subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over this matter - and our subcommittee staff is in contact with officials of both the City of New York and the New York Yankees to discuss their potential appearance in front of our congressional subcommittee.

We're going to return in a minute and to continue the conversation. And before Congressman Kucinich leaves, we also want to ask him about the hearings in Congress, the potential impeachment hearings. We'll be back in a minute. [break] JUAN GONZALEZ : We're talking about the use of public subsidies for sports stadiums. We're joined from Washington, D.C. by Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich.

JUAN GONZALEZ : Bettina, those who advocate these stadiums say, \"Why not? This is economic development. It's creating jobs. It's keeping a sort of a -- the psychology of the city by having a professional sports team that the residents can root for.\" What's wrong with it? BETTINA DAMIANI : All the subsidies that Neil just listed. You would like to assume that the city and the state made a clear path to making sure that there were going to be jobs, good-paying jobs for New Yorkers, on the other end. That was going to be the investment, right? We see nothing. There's nothing that says a certain number of jobs has to be set aside for either local New York residents or local Bronx residents, or the number of jobs at all. The city has really washed their hands of making sure there's any accountability on jobs and clear benefits for New Yorkers on the other side of this project, which is very unfortunate. I mean, we're grateful for Congressman Kucinich and Assembly member Brodsky to get involved in this issue. Neither represent New York City, by the way. New York City elected officials - they're filling a void, because local elected officials in New York City have refused to get involved in this project. And we need them. We need them to make sure that the promises in the press releases actually turn out to be something that we can hold them accountable for. JUAN GONZALEZ : And you have, generally speaking, on this issue of tax-exempt financing for economic development, raised numerous questions over the years. It's been one of my favorite topics, how cities are siphoning off their tax bases to create special deals for developers, whether it's sports teams or private companies, where they're, in essence, siphoning off the existing tax base from the municipal government and using it to fund special projects. How rampant is this, not only in New York, but throughout the country? BETTINA DAMIANI : It's a terrible issue regarding not only the issue of financing, but making sure that there are quality jobs for Americans and, in our case, New Yorkers. There's a thing called the economic war among the states, where it seems that so many municipalities and states are worried about fighting one another for the headquarters of a particular agency that they're willing to set aside basic fiscal commonsense and not making sure that there are real quality jobs on the ends of these big deals. Site consultants are prevalent throughout the country that have really manufactured this process, and they make it seem like if the Yankees didn't get their subsidy or if the New York Stock Exchange didn't get a subsidy, they were going to flee somewhere else, without taking into consideration or doing some real due diligence. Where were the Yankees going to go? The Yankees are famous because they're in the Bronx. We have a large media here. We have an incredible fan base here. And it seems none of that was taken in consideration before this huge giveaway was done. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, that's one of the things I think Assembly member Brodsky is trying to investigate, because the city agency that engineered this deal, the Industrial Development Authority, apparently said that the Yankees were threatening to leave New York, of course, the most expensive media market in the country, the most desirable media market in the country. Neil, your sense of whether that was real or not? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah, I mean, and I think everyone knows that the Yankees were not going to move out of New York City, and it's kind of been an open secret for decades now, as long as George Steinbrenner has been demanding a stadium. Where is he going to go? The Yankees are not worth the, whatever, billion dollars that they're worth if they move to Charlotte, North Carolina. But that was the pretense. And the Yankees actually told the judge in a case trying to stop the demolition of the parks, \"Well, if you try and hold up this case, the Yankees could move.\" And, you know, they've been allowed to get away with this. And as Bettina was saying, elected officials never challenged them on this, until, you know, recently Brodsky is trying - been trying to track it down. JUAN GONZALEZ : And, of course, the final irony of all of this is, in the new stadium, once it gets built, as with all these stadiums, the ticket prices for the average baseball fan go through the roof. The prices in Yankee Stadium for box seats now are astronomical -- they're astronomical now, but what they will cost in the new stadium is unbelievable. Could you talk about some of the prices that they've released so far? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah. I mean, they're talking over, you know, $1,000, $2,000 a seat for some of the really premium seats. And I think what you're going to see is -- JUAN GONZALEZ : For one game? NEIL DEMAUSE : For one game, yes. For one game, yes, absolutely. For a whole season, you know, all bets are off. But I think, you know, what you're going to see the Yankees do, they've promised to keep bleacher tickets low. They've promised to keep a certain number of, you know, $25-or-less seats. I think what you're going to see them do is, especially with Brodsky and everyone else paying attention to the soaring costs, I think you're going to see the Yankees keep ticket prices low for the first season or two and, you know, try to say, \"OK, we're holding the line.\" And then, as everybody's clamoring to get tickets, two, three years down the road, you'll see those start to creep up. So, what I'm worried about isn't, next year, is it going to be affordable, but three years from now, is anybody going to be able to get a ticket? JUAN GONZALEZ : Right. And then, of course, the final irony with - because most of these stadiums have luxury boxes that are for corporations that go from $500,000 to $800,000, in the case of the Yankees, per year to rent these boxes, and of course, my newspaper, the Daily News , reported yesterday that in this deal, the City of New York arranged to have its own luxury box at Yankee Stadium available, presumably to city officials, as part of the deal for the financing. Bettina, your response to that? BETTINA DAMIANI : It's aptly coined the landlord suite. And it's just another example of how local elected officials almost seem to be void of feeling that they have responsibility to the public, because they're going to get nice seats, in the long run. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, I want to thank both of you for being with us, Bettina Damiani, the project director of Good Jobs New York, and Neil deMause, who's a writer and the author of Field of Schemes: How the Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money into Private Profit .\n\nREP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, in 1986, there was a change in the tax law which made it very clear that stadiums could not be using these tax-exempt bonds to construct these professional sports stadiums. The IRS had a ruling in a private letter that essentially gave the sports teams the ability to make payments in lieu of taxes, which was kind of a loophole that enabled them to get to the point of being able to participate in these tax-free financing schemes. And so, I've had a hearing where we talked to the IRS , asked them for an explanation. And from what I understand, as a result of our hearing, they're reviewing their policies to see whether or not the 1986 Tax Reform Act has actually been compromised by the decision that they made. I think that it's important to understand that we're not alleging, at this point, that there's been any kind of criminal activity. We're simply reviewing all the information that's been presented to us, so that we can determine, first of all, the discrepancies in the appraisals, secondly, the public policy issue of using tax-exempt bonds for these stadiums, and third, if there is an inflated value of this project, the implication that it has for security laws with respect to the issuance of the tremendous amount of bond financing. JUAN GONZALEZ : I'd like ask Bettina Damiani from Good Jobs New York, this whole issue of this thing called \"PILOTs,\" or payments in lieu of taxes, for use of repaying these tax-exempt bonds, is a very complicated issue that most the general public doesn't understand. Your organization has been in the forefront of questioning these kinds of development deals by New York, but also, by extension, by many municipalities around the country. Could you break down how these PILOTs work generally? BETTINA DAMIANI : Certainly. And it's not just the average New Yorker, as we learned through the Yankee Stadium project. Most New York City and New York State elected officials don't quite understand the issue of PILOTs, which is part of the crux of this issue. Essentially, PILOTs are payments in lieu of taxes. Instead of paying taxes, the Yankees are paying back their tax-free bonds. So, there's money that should be going into, as Assembly member Brodsky mentioned, the pot of money that would help pay for roads and schools and other services that New York City needs. Instead, it's just going - it's being completely diverted. And this, unfortunately, is a policy that is not done just with the Yankees but with a variety of other very large financial firms that have managed to make a special deal with New York City. JUAN GONZALEZ : And in this particular case, it was actually in the interest of the New York Yankees to have a very high assessment of their land, because that would allow them to be able to float more bonds and pay more PILOTs, which is their main goal here, is to raise as much money as possible to build their stadium, right? BETTINA DAMIANI : Exactly, and that's the irony. And that's one of the things that you mentioned in your article yesterday, is that in the South Bronx, the city was trying desperately to inflate the value of property, but not to benefit the larger community or the people that live in the neighborhood, but really for the sole benefit of the New York Yankees. JUAN GONZALEZ : And, Neil deMause, you've been writing now for quite a while about these stadium boondoggles. Virtually every major city in America is building a new arena or a new stadium of one kind, and most of them are using some degree or other of public financing. Could you give us a sense of the overall national picture? NEIL DEMAUSE : Sure. I mean, I think it's absolutely correct that every major and minor city is either building a stadium or arena or being asked to estimate somewhere around $2 billion a year of public money going into these buildings, a very, very small percentage of which comes back in terms of, you know, tax benefits or actually benefits to the cities. You know, when the Yankees and the Mets first announced their deals, Mayor Bloomberg said, \"Oh, you know, we don't make subsidies; we make investments, and we get our money back.\" At the time, it was announced, well, the Yankees and Mets are going to be paying for, you know, all the construction costs of the stadium. As you look at it and break down where they're getting tax breaks and where they're getting sort of hidden subsidies, the taxpayers wind up paying most of the cost. JUAN GONZALEZ : And, Congressman Kucinich, you originally had scheduled your hearing for this week but then decided to postpone it until September. Have you been in conversations with the City of New York and with the Yankees about them also testifying at your hearing? And what documents, specifically, are you trying to get from them now? REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, I could say that my subcommittee staff - and again, I'm the chair of the Domestic Policy Subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over this matter - and our subcommittee staff is in contact with officials of both the City of New York and the New York Yankees to discuss their potential appearance in front of our congressional subcommittee. I think that it's very important to understand that we're looking at a public policy matter here that relates not only to New York and not only to the Nets and the Atlantic Yard project, but it also relates to the whole country, as your other guests have said, because it's quite possible that there are billions of dollars in tax benefits that should be going to municipalities for the purposes of repairing their infrastructure and for schools and other things and that are instead being diverted for these private sports complexes. And the question is one of public policy, one of the IRS , and in the case of the New York Yankees, questions of securities law, because of the various amounts of the appraisal, $45 a square foot versus $275 a square foot, which have a bearing on the overall cost of the project. And if the cost of the project is inflated, that's going to be of interest to the SEC , as well as the IRS . JUAN GONZALEZ : And in terms of the - you're not, at this point, contemplating subpoenaing any records. You're figuring that they are going to be - they will provide you the documents and the information that you requested to avoid that potential. REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, you know, we generally assume that we'll get cooperation. I mean, certainly, as an investigative subcommittee, if we need to enforce that request with a subpoena, we have the ability to apply for that. But we're not at that point yet. And, you know, we're hopeful for cooperation on the part of all the parties involved. And I think that, again, this is a matter of serious public policy. When you have New York City, a great American city, which has all these capital infrastructure needs, and when payments get diverted, essentially - payments are not going into areas where the city expects the tax revenues will be coming from, and instead they're diverted in these payments in lieu of taxes, they're intensely serious matters that need to be discussed. And so, that's why the work that Mr. Brodsky is doing and your other guests are involved in is very significant. We're going to continue with our work on the Domestic Policy Subcommittee, and we'll be sure to keep you posted. JUAN GONZALEZ : OK. We're talking with Congressman Dennis Kucinich in Washington, and here also, Bettina Damiani of Good Jobs New York and Neil deMause, the author of Field of Schemes . We're going to return in a minute and to continue the conversation. And before Congressman Kucinich leaves, we also want to ask him about the hearings in Congress, the potential impeachment hearings. We'll be back in a minute. [break] JUAN GONZALEZ : We're talking about the use of public subsidies for sports stadiums. We're joined from Washington, D.C. by Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich. And here in New York, we have Bettina Damiani, the project director of Good Jobs New York, and Neil deMause, author of Field of Schemes: How the Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money into Private Profit . But, Congressman Kucinich, you've been leading the fight for impeachment, and I know you have to go very soon, so I wanted to ask you about an interview with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that aired on The View earlier this week. She was asked about impeachment. JOY BEHAR : You've ruled against impeaching George Bush and Dick Cheney, and now Kucinich is trying to pass that. Why do you insist on not impeaching these people, so that the world and America can really see the crimes that they've committed? REP . NANCY PELOSI : Well, I think that it - I think it was important, when I became Speaker - and it's, by the way, a very important position - President, Vice President, Speaker of the House - I saw it as my responsibility to try to bring a much divided country together to the extent that we could. I thought that impeachment would be divisive for the country. In terms of what we wanted - set out to do, we wanted to raise the minimum wage, give the biggest increase in veterans benefits to veterans in the seventy-seven-year history, then pass research for stem cell research, all of that. This week, we're going to pass equal pay for equal work. It has been a long time in coming - pay equity. We're going to pass legislations for product safety, for toys that children put in their - there's an agenda that you have to get done. You have to try to do it in a bipartisan way. The President has to sign it. If somebody had a crime that the President had committed, that would be a different story. JOY BEHAR : Can they still do it after he's out? BARBARA WALTERS : When we - when I interviewed you last year, you had just begun, and you were going to clean up the mess, remember? REP . NANCY PELOSI : And we did. BARBARA WALTERS : You look around this country, 75 percent of the country - forget George Bush - thinks that Congress is doing a lousy job. ELISABETH HASSELBECK : I think it's 91 percent now. REP . NANCY PELOSI : Well, I don't disagree with that, because largely it's predicated on ending the war in Iraq. That's the main question, and we were not successful. In our House of Representatives, I'm very proud of our members, because they voted overwhelmingly over and over again to bring the war to an end, bring the troops home safely and soon, sent it to the Senate, and it hits a dead end. But in terms of that particular standard, I would say I disapprove, as well. But we do - we passed some of the things I just mentioned, the energy bill. We worked in a bipartisan way, Innovation Agenda. We have to create jobs, expand healthcare, protect the American people and educate our children. And you can't do that if you're trying to impeach the President at the same time, unless you have the goods that this president committed crimes. JUAN GONZALEZ : That was House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Congressman Kucinich, your response to her take on the situation with impeachment? REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, now that I've heard that the Speaker is looking for evidence that crimes may have been committed, I certainly want to direct her attention to the thirty-five articles of impeachment that I presented, which assert quite directly that crimes have been committed, including taking this nation into a war, an illegal war, based on lies; including the deaths of over a million innocent Iraqis, which constitute a war crime; including wiretapping, rendition, torture, illegal detention. There are many examples of laws that have been broken. And the reason why the Judiciary Committee should hold a hearing on the impeachment itself is because there needs to be a public airing of this. So, I have a great deal of respect for Speaker Pelosi, and I think that since she made that statement on The View , there's an opportunity now for us to come forward and to lay all the facts out so that she can reconsider her decision not to permit the Judiciary Committee to proceed with a full impeachment hearing. I just want to state this, that I appreciate that she consented to a hearing on Friday. It was a six-hour hearing, over a dozen witnesses. Twenty-four members of Congress attended. It's being taken seriously. I think the idea that nothing can be done right now because we're on the eve of an election raises questions about our constitutional responsibility to be a check and balance to administration abuse of power. If in fact we're in a war that's based on lies, and we have thousands of troops whose lives are on the line every day, we owe it to them and we owe it to the American people to set straight the public record. And then, whether or not it results in the President being removed from office before the end of his term is another matter. I want to further say that with the possibility of a war in Iran in the offing, a war against Iran, a war that would be a result of a pre-emptive attack, much like the one that the United States launched against Iraq, it becomes very important that we hold this administration to the highest standard of having to verify the statements they make to take us into one war and to try to take us into another. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, Congressman Dennis Kucinich of Ohio, thank you, once again, for joining us. And we're going to continue the conversation here on the stadium issues with Bettina Damiani of Good Jobs New York and Neil deMause, author of Field of Schemes . I'd like to - again, getting back to the stadium deal, this Yankee Stadium is the most expensive stadium in the history of the United States. The actual cost is very hard to get your hands around, because there are some public infrastructure subsidies. But we're talking about a stadium that is going to be somewhere between one and two billion dollars, when you add up all of the actual costs, probably closer to two. And, Neil, could you talk about this - how the public expenditures are being used, even though we're being told that they're not being - public money is not being used directly for the stadium? NEIL DEMAUSE : Sure. I mean, it's something I've been trying to track ever since this was first announced three years ago. There is, as you mentioned, this infrastructure cost, where the public is paying for building new parks to replace the ones that were torn down to make way for the new stadium, paying for moving a water main and other things like that. JUAN GONZALEZ : And when you say parks that were torn down, because that was, itself, a big issue -- NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah, this -- JUAN GONZALEZ : - this is public park land, about a - what was it? Twenty acres or at least -- NEIL DEMAUSE : It was like twenty-two acres that was actually demolished. It was park that had been there even longer than Yankee Stadium that was demolished to make way for the new stadium. To make up for this, the city and state had to make sure that there was an equal amount of park land that was created. So they're knocking down the old stadium completely. Originally, the team was talking, \"Oh, we're going to save it as a museum.\" It's going to be gone starting next year, and they're going to put some ball fields there. And they've found some space down by the Harlem River where they're going to squeeze in some tennis courts, and sort of little patchwork of parks around different places. The public is paying for all that. The public is paying for the actual demolition of Yankee Stadium, is all going to be public. The public is paying a good chunk for building new parking garages for the Yankees, including one that will be used by the players and VIPs and various folks like that. And the team is getting all sorts of different tax breaks. As Bettina mentioned, they're not going to be paying property taxes. They're going to be getting mortgage-recording taxes. They're going to be getting these tax-exempt bonds that we've been talking about, which is actually a tremendous amount of money, if they get the new $300 million in bonds they're looking for. They're going to be talking about getting more than $300 million worth of tax breaks just on the bonds themselves. So when you add it all up, you get somewhere around $900 million worth of public money that's being spent just on Yankee Stadium. JUAN GONZALEZ : Bettina, those who advocate these stadiums say, \"Why not? This is economic development. It's creating jobs. It's keeping a sort of a -- the psychology of the city by having a professional sports team that the residents can root for.\" What's wrong with it? BETTINA DAMIANI : All the subsidies that Neil just listed. You would like to assume that the city and the state made a clear path to making sure that there were going to be jobs, good-paying jobs for New Yorkers, on the other end. That was going to be the investment, right? We see nothing. There's nothing that says a certain number of jobs has to be set aside for either local New York residents or local Bronx residents, or the number of jobs at all. The city has really washed their hands of making sure there's any accountability on jobs and clear benefits for New Yorkers on the other side of this project, which is very unfortunate. I mean, we're grateful for Congressman Kucinich and Assembly member Brodsky to get involved in this issue. Neither represent New York City, by the way.

JUAN GONZALEZ : And in terms of the - you're not, at this point, contemplating subpoenaing any records. You're figuring that they are going to be - they will provide you the documents and the information that you requested to avoid that potential. REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, you know, we generally assume that we'll get cooperation. I mean, certainly, as an investigative subcommittee, if we need to enforce that request with a subpoena, we have the ability to apply for that. But we're not at that point yet. And, you know, we're hopeful for cooperation on the part of all the parties involved. And I think that, again, this is a matter of serious public policy. When you have New York City, a great American city, which has all these capital infrastructure needs, and when payments get diverted, essentially - payments are not going into areas where the city expects the tax revenues will be coming from, and instead they're diverted in these payments in lieu of taxes, they're intensely serious matters that need to be discussed. And so, that's why the work that Mr. Brodsky is doing and your other guests are involved in is very significant. We're going to continue with our work on the Domestic Policy Subcommittee, and we'll be sure to keep you posted. JUAN GONZALEZ : OK. We're talking with Congressman Dennis Kucinich in Washington, and here also, Bettina Damiani of Good Jobs New York and Neil deMause, the author of Field of Schemes . We're going to return in a minute and to continue the conversation. And before Congressman Kucinich leaves, we also want to ask him about the hearings in Congress, the potential impeachment hearings. We'll be back in a minute. [break] JUAN GONZALEZ : We're talking about the use of public subsidies for sports stadiums. We're joined from Washington, D.C. by Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich. And here in New York, we have Bettina Damiani, the project director of Good Jobs New York, and Neil deMause, author of Field of Schemes: How the Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money into Private Profit . But, Congressman Kucinich, you've been leading the fight for impeachment, and I know you have to go very soon, so I wanted to ask you about an interview with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that aired on The View earlier this week. She was asked about impeachment. JOY BEHAR : You've ruled against impeaching George Bush and Dick Cheney, and now Kucinich is trying to pass that. Why do you insist on not impeaching these people, so that the world and America can really see the crimes that they've committed? REP . NANCY PELOSI : Well, I think that it - I think it was important, when I became Speaker - and it's, by the way, a very important position - President, Vice President, Speaker of the House - I saw it as my responsibility to try to bring a much divided country together to the extent that we could. I thought that impeachment would be divisive for the country. In terms of what we wanted - set out to do, we wanted to raise the minimum wage, give the biggest increase in veterans benefits to veterans in the seventy-seven-year history, then pass research for stem cell research, all of that. This week, we're going to pass equal pay for equal work. It has been a long time in coming - pay equity. We're going to pass legislations for product safety, for toys that children put in their - there's an agenda that you have to get done. You have to try to do it in a bipartisan way. The President has to sign it. If somebody had a crime that the President had committed, that would be a different story. JOY BEHAR : Can they still do it after he's out? BARBARA WALTERS : When we - when I interviewed you last year, you had just begun, and you were going to clean up the mess, remember? REP . NANCY PELOSI : And we did. BARBARA WALTERS : You look around this country, 75 percent of the country - forget George Bush - thinks that Congress is doing a lousy job. ELISABETH HASSELBECK : I think it's 91 percent now. REP . NANCY PELOSI : Well, I don't disagree with that, because largely it's predicated on ending the war in Iraq. That's the main question, and we were not successful. In our House of Representatives, I'm very proud of our members, because they voted overwhelmingly over and over again to bring the war to an end, bring the troops home safely and soon, sent it to the Senate, and it hits a dead end. But in terms of that particular standard, I would say I disapprove, as well. But we do - we passed some of the things I just mentioned, the energy bill. We worked in a bipartisan way, Innovation Agenda. We have to create jobs, expand healthcare, protect the American people and educate our children. And you can't do that if you're trying to impeach the President at the same time, unless you have the goods that this president committed crimes. JUAN GONZALEZ : That was House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Congressman Kucinich, your response to her take on the situation with impeachment? REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, now that I've heard that the Speaker is looking for evidence that crimes may have been committed, I certainly want to direct her attention to the thirty-five articles of impeachment that I presented, which assert quite directly that crimes have been committed, including taking this nation into a war, an illegal war, based on lies; including the deaths of over a million innocent Iraqis, which constitute a war crime; including wiretapping, rendition, torture, illegal detention. There are many examples of laws that have been broken. And the reason why the Judiciary Committee should hold a hearing on the impeachment itself is because there needs to be a public airing of this. So, I have a great deal of respect for Speaker Pelosi, and I think that since she made that statement on The View , there's an opportunity now for us to come forward and to lay all the facts out so that she can reconsider her decision not to permit the Judiciary Committee to proceed with a full impeachment hearing. I just want to state this, that I appreciate that she consented to a hearing on Friday. It was a six-hour hearing, over a dozen witnesses. Twenty-four members of Congress attended. It's being taken seriously. I think the idea that nothing can be done right now because we're on the eve of an election raises questions about our constitutional responsibility to be a check and balance to administration abuse of power. If in fact we're in a war that's based on lies, and we have thousands of troops whose lives are on the line every day, we owe it to them and we owe it to the American people to set straight the public record. And then, whether or not it results in the President being removed from office before the end of his term is another matter. I want to further say that with the possibility of a war in Iran in the offing, a war against Iran, a war that would be a result of a pre-emptive attack, much like the one that the United States launched against Iraq, it becomes very important that we hold this administration to the highest standard of having to verify the statements they make to take us into one war and to try to take us into another. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, Congressman Dennis Kucinich of Ohio, thank you, once again, for joining us. And we're going to continue the conversation here on the stadium issues with Bettina Damiani of Good Jobs New York and Neil deMause, author of Field of Schemes . I'd like to - again, getting back to the stadium deal, this Yankee Stadium is the most expensive stadium in the history of the United States. The actual cost is very hard to get your hands around, because there are some public infrastructure subsidies. But we're talking about a stadium that is going to be somewhere between one and two billion dollars, when you add up all of the actual costs, probably closer to two. And, Neil, could you talk about this - how the public expenditures are being used, even though we're being told that they're not being - public money is not being used directly for the stadium? NEIL DEMAUSE : Sure. I mean, it's something I've been trying to track ever since this was first announced three years ago. There is, as you mentioned, this infrastructure cost, where the public is paying for building new parks to replace the ones that were torn down to make way for the new stadium, paying for moving a water main and other things like that. JUAN GONZALEZ : And when you say parks that were torn down, because that was, itself, a big issue -- NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah, this -- JUAN GONZALEZ : - this is public park land, about a - what was it? Twenty acres or at least -- NEIL DEMAUSE : It was like twenty-two acres that was actually demolished. It was park that had been there even longer than Yankee Stadium that was demolished to make way for the new stadium. To make up for this, the city and state had to make sure that there was an equal amount of park land that was created. So they're knocking down the old stadium completely. Originally, the team was talking, \"Oh, we're going to save it as a museum.\" It's going to be gone starting next year, and they're going to put some ball fields there. And they've found some space down by the Harlem River where they're going to squeeze in some tennis courts, and sort of little patchwork of parks around different places. The public is paying for all that. The public is paying for the actual demolition of Yankee Stadium, is all going to be public. The public is paying a good chunk for building new parking garages for the Yankees, including one that will be used by the players and VIPs and various folks like that. And the team is getting all sorts of different tax breaks. As Bettina mentioned, they're not going to be paying property taxes. They're going to be getting mortgage-recording taxes. They're going to be getting these tax-exempt bonds that we've been talking about, which is actually a tremendous amount of money, if they get the new $300 million in bonds they're looking for. They're going to be talking about getting more than $300 million worth of tax breaks just on the bonds themselves. So when you add it all up, you get somewhere around $900 million worth of public money that's being spent just on Yankee Stadium. JUAN GONZALEZ : Bettina, those who advocate these stadiums say, \"Why not? This is economic development. It's creating jobs. It's keeping a sort of a -- the psychology of the city by having a professional sports team that the residents can root for.\" What's wrong with it? BETTINA DAMIANI : All the subsidies that Neil just listed. You would like to assume that the city and the state made a clear path to making sure that there were going to be jobs, good-paying jobs for New Yorkers, on the other end. That was going to be the investment, right? We see nothing. There's nothing that says a certain number of jobs has to be set aside for either local New York residents or local Bronx residents, or the number of jobs at all. The city has really washed their hands of making sure there's any accountability on jobs and clear benefits for New Yorkers on the other side of this project, which is very unfortunate. I mean, we're grateful for Congressman Kucinich and Assembly member Brodsky to get involved in this issue. Neither represent New York City, by the way. New York City elected officials - they're filling a void, because local elected officials in New York City have refused to get involved in this project. And we need them. We need them to make sure that the promises in the press releases actually turn out to be something that we can hold them accountable for. JUAN GONZALEZ : And you have, generally speaking, on this issue of tax-exempt financing for economic development, raised numerous questions over the years. It's been one of my favorite topics, how cities are siphoning off their tax bases to create special deals for developers, whether it's sports teams or private companies, where they're, in essence, siphoning off the existing tax base from the municipal government and using it to fund special projects. How rampant is this, not only in New York, but throughout the country? BETTINA DAMIANI : It's a terrible issue regarding not only the issue of financing, but making sure that there are quality jobs for Americans and, in our case, New Yorkers. There's a thing called the economic war among the states, where it seems that so many municipalities and states are worried about fighting one another for the headquarters of a particular agency that they're willing to set aside basic fiscal commonsense and not making sure that there are real quality jobs on the ends of these big deals. Site consultants are prevalent throughout the country that have really manufactured this process, and they make it seem like if the Yankees didn't get their subsidy or if the New York Stock Exchange didn't get a subsidy, they were going to flee somewhere else, without taking into consideration or doing some real due diligence. Where were the Yankees going to go? The Yankees are famous because they're in the Bronx. We have a large media here. We have an incredible fan base here. And it seems none of that was taken in consideration before this huge giveaway was done. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, that's one of the things I think Assembly member Brodsky is trying to investigate, because the city agency that engineered this deal, the Industrial Development Authority, apparently said that the Yankees were threatening to leave New York, of course, the most expensive media market in the country, the most desirable media market in the country. Neil, your sense of whether that was real or not? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah, I mean, and I think everyone knows that the Yankees were not going to move out of New York City, and it's kind of been an open secret for decades now, as long as George Steinbrenner has been demanding a stadium. Where is he going to go? The Yankees are not worth the, whatever, billion dollars that they're worth if they move to Charlotte, North Carolina. But that was the pretense. And the Yankees actually told the judge in a case trying to stop the demolition of the parks, \"Well, if you try and hold up this case, the Yankees could move.\" And, you know, they've been allowed to get away with this. And as Bettina was saying, elected officials never challenged them on this, until, you know, recently Brodsky is trying - been trying to track it down. JUAN GONZALEZ : And, of course, the final irony of all of this is, in the new stadium, once it gets built, as with all these stadiums, the ticket prices for the average baseball fan go through the roof. The prices in Yankee Stadium for box seats now are astronomical -- they're astronomical now, but what they will cost in the new stadium is unbelievable. Could you talk about some of the prices that they've released so far? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah. I mean, they're talking over, you know, $1,000, $2,000 a seat for some of the really premium seats. And I think what you're going to see is -- JUAN GONZALEZ : For one game? NEIL DEMAUSE : For one game, yes. For one game, yes, absolutely. For a whole season, you know, all bets are off. But I think, you know, what you're going to see the Yankees do, they've promised to keep bleacher tickets low. They've promised to keep a certain number of, you know, $25-or-less seats. I think what you're going to see them do is, especially with Brodsky and everyone else paying attention to the soaring costs, I think you're going to see the Yankees keep ticket prices low for the first season or two and, you know, try to say, \"OK, we're holding the line.\" And then, as everybody's clamoring to get tickets, two, three years down the road, you'll see those start to creep up. So, what I'm worried about isn't, next year, is it going to be affordable, but three years from now, is anybody going to be able to get a ticket? JUAN GONZALEZ : Right. And then, of course, the final irony with - because most of these stadiums have luxury boxes that are for corporations that go from $500,000 to $800,000, in the case of the Yankees, per year to rent these boxes, and of course, my newspaper, the Daily News , reported yesterday that in this deal, the City of New York arranged to have its own luxury box at Yankee Stadium available, presumably to city officials, as part of the deal for the financing. Bettina, your response to that? BETTINA DAMIANI : It's aptly coined the landlord suite. And it's just another example of how local elected officials almost seem to be void of feeling that they have responsibility to the public, because they're going to get nice seats, in the long run. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, I want to thank both of you for being with us, Bettina Damiani, the project director of Good Jobs New York, and Neil deMause, who's a writer and the author of Field of Schemes: How the Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money into Private Profit .\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : I'd like ask Bettina Damiani from Good Jobs New York, this whole issue of this thing called \"PILOTs,\" or payments in lieu of taxes, for use of repaying these tax-exempt bonds, is a very complicated issue that most the general public doesn't understand. Your organization has been in the forefront of questioning these kinds of development deals by New York, but also, by extension, by many municipalities around the country. Could you break down how these PILOTs work generally? BETTINA DAMIANI : Certainly. And it's not just the average New Yorker, as we learned through the Yankee Stadium project. Most New York City and New York State elected officials don't quite understand the issue of PILOTs, which is part of the crux of this issue. Essentially, PILOTs are payments in lieu of taxes. Instead of paying taxes, the Yankees are paying back their tax-free bonds. So, there's money that should be going into, as Assembly member Brodsky mentioned, the pot of money that would help pay for roads and schools and other services that New York City needs. Instead, it's just going - it's being completely diverted. And this, unfortunately, is a policy that is not done just with the Yankees but with a variety of other very large financial firms that have managed to make a special deal with New York City. JUAN GONZALEZ : And in this particular case, it was actually in the interest of the New York Yankees to have a very high assessment of their land, because that would allow them to be able to float more bonds and pay more PILOTs, which is their main goal here, is to raise as much money as possible to build their stadium, right? BETTINA DAMIANI : Exactly, and that's the irony. And that's one of the things that you mentioned in your article yesterday, is that in the South Bronx, the city was trying desperately to inflate the value of property, but not to benefit the larger community or the people that live in the neighborhood, but really for the sole benefit of the New York Yankees. JUAN GONZALEZ : And, Neil deMause, you've been writing now for quite a while about these stadium boondoggles. Virtually every major city in America is building a new arena or a new stadium of one kind, and most of them are using some degree or other of public financing. Could you give us a sense of the overall national picture? NEIL DEMAUSE : Sure. I mean, I think it's absolutely correct that every major and minor city is either building a stadium or arena or being asked to estimate somewhere around $2 billion a year of public money going into these buildings, a very, very small percentage of which comes back in terms of, you know, tax benefits or actually benefits to the cities. You know, when the Yankees and the Mets first announced their deals, Mayor Bloomberg said, \"Oh, you know, we don't make subsidies; we make investments, and we get our money back.\" At the time, it was announced, well, the Yankees and Mets are going to be paying for, you know, all the construction costs of the stadium. As you look at it and break down where they're getting tax breaks and where they're getting sort of hidden subsidies, the taxpayers wind up paying most of the cost. JUAN GONZALEZ : And, Congressman Kucinich, you originally had scheduled your hearing for this week but then decided to postpone it until September. Have you been in conversations with the City of New York and with the Yankees about them also testifying at your hearing? And what documents, specifically, are you trying to get from them now? REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, I could say that my subcommittee staff - and again, I'm the chair of the Domestic Policy Subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over this matter - and our subcommittee staff is in contact with officials of both the City of New York and the New York Yankees to discuss their potential appearance in front of our congressional subcommittee. I think that it's very important to understand that we're looking at a public policy matter here that relates not only to New York and not only to the Nets and the Atlantic Yard project, but it also relates to the whole country, as your other guests have said, because it's quite possible that there are billions of dollars in tax benefits that should be going to municipalities for the purposes of repairing their infrastructure and for schools and other things and that are instead being diverted for these private sports complexes. And the question is one of public policy, one of the IRS , and in the case of the New York Yankees, questions of securities law, because of the various amounts of the appraisal, $45 a square foot versus $275 a square foot, which have a bearing on the overall cost of the project. And if the cost of the project is inflated, that's going to be of interest to the SEC , as well as the IRS . JUAN GONZALEZ : And in terms of the - you're not, at this point, contemplating subpoenaing any records. You're figuring that they are going to be - they will provide you the documents and the information that you requested to avoid that potential. REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, you know, we generally assume that we'll get cooperation. I mean, certainly, as an investigative subcommittee, if we need to enforce that request with a subpoena, we have the ability to apply for that. But we're not at that point yet. And, you know, we're hopeful for cooperation on the part of all the parties involved. And I think that, again, this is a matter of serious public policy. When you have New York City, a great American city, which has all these capital infrastructure needs, and when payments get diverted, essentially - payments are not going into areas where the city expects the tax revenues will be coming from, and instead they're diverted in these payments in lieu of taxes, they're intensely serious matters that need to be discussed. And so, that's why the work that Mr. Brodsky is doing and your other guests are involved in is very significant. We're going to continue with our work on the Domestic Policy Subcommittee, and we'll be sure to keep you posted. JUAN GONZALEZ : OK. We're talking with Congressman Dennis Kucinich in Washington, and here also, Bettina Damiani of Good Jobs New York and Neil deMause, the author of Field of Schemes . We're going to return in a minute and to continue the conversation. And before Congressman Kucinich leaves, we also want to ask him about the hearings in Congress, the potential impeachment hearings. We'll be back in a minute. [break] JUAN GONZALEZ : We're talking about the use of public subsidies for sports stadiums. We're joined from Washington, D.C. by Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich. And here in New York, we have Bettina Damiani, the project director of Good Jobs New York, and Neil deMause, author of Field of Schemes: How the Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money into Private Profit . But, Congressman Kucinich, you've been leading the fight for impeachment, and I know you have to go very soon, so I wanted to ask you about an interview with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that aired on The View earlier this week. She was asked about impeachment. JOY BEHAR : You've ruled against impeaching George Bush and Dick Cheney, and now Kucinich is trying to pass that. Why do you insist on not impeaching these people, so that the world and America can really see the crimes that they've committed? REP . NANCY PELOSI : Well, I think that it - I think it was important, when I became Speaker - and it's, by the way, a very important position - President, Vice President, Speaker of the House - I saw it as my responsibility to try to bring a much divided country together to the extent that we could. I thought that impeachment would be divisive for the country. In terms of what we wanted - set out to do, we wanted to raise the minimum wage, give the biggest increase in veterans benefits to veterans in the seventy-seven-year history, then pass research for stem cell research, all of that. This week, we're going to pass equal pay for equal work. It has been a long time in coming - pay equity. We're going to pass legislations for product safety, for toys that children put in their - there's an agenda that you have to get done. You have to try to do it in a bipartisan way. The President has to sign it. If somebody had a crime that the President had committed, that would be a different story. JOY BEHAR : Can they still do it after he's out? BARBARA WALTERS : When we - when I interviewed you last year, you had just begun, and you were going to clean up the mess, remember? REP . NANCY PELOSI : And we did. BARBARA WALTERS : You look around this country, 75 percent of the country - forget George Bush - thinks that Congress is doing a lousy job. ELISABETH HASSELBECK : I think it's 91 percent now. REP . NANCY PELOSI : Well, I don't disagree with that, because largely it's predicated on ending the war in Iraq. That's the main question, and we were not successful. In our House of Representatives, I'm very proud of our members, because they voted overwhelmingly over and over again to bring the war to an end, bring the troops home safely and soon, sent it to the Senate, and it hits a dead end. But in terms of that particular standard, I would say I disapprove, as well. But we do - we passed some of the things I just mentioned, the energy bill. We worked in a bipartisan way, Innovation Agenda. We have to create jobs, expand healthcare, protect the American people and educate our children. And you can't do that if you're trying to impeach the President at the same time, unless you have the goods that this president committed crimes. JUAN GONZALEZ : That was House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Congressman Kucinich, your response to her take on the situation with impeachment? REP .

JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, Congressman Dennis Kucinich of Ohio, thank you, once again, for joining us. And we're going to continue the conversation here on the stadium issues with Bettina Damiani of Good Jobs New York and Neil deMause, author of Field of Schemes . I'd like to - again, getting back to the stadium deal, this Yankee Stadium is the most expensive stadium in the history of the United States. The actual cost is very hard to get your hands around, because there are some public infrastructure subsidies. But we're talking about a stadium that is going to be somewhere between one and two billion dollars, when you add up all of the actual costs, probably closer to two. And, Neil, could you talk about this - how the public expenditures are being used, even though we're being told that they're not being - public money is not being used directly for the stadium?

They're going to be talking about getting more than $300 million worth of tax breaks just on the bonds themselves. So when you add it all up, you get somewhere around $900 million worth of public money that's being spent just on Yankee Stadium. JUAN GONZALEZ : Bettina, those who advocate these stadiums say, \"Why not? This is economic development. It's creating jobs. It's keeping a sort of a -- the psychology of the city by having a professional sports team that the residents can root for.\" What's wrong with it? BETTINA DAMIANI : All the subsidies that Neil just listed. You would like to assume that the city and the state made a clear path to making sure that there were going to be jobs, good-paying jobs for New Yorkers, on the other end. That was going to be the investment, right? We see nothing. There's nothing that says a certain number of jobs has to be set aside for either local New York residents or local Bronx residents, or the number of jobs at all.

We need them to make sure that the promises in the press releases actually turn out to be something that we can hold them accountable for. JUAN GONZALEZ : And you have, generally speaking, on this issue of tax-exempt financing for economic development, raised numerous questions over the years. It's been one of my favorite topics, how cities are siphoning off their tax bases to create special deals for developers, whether it's sports teams or private companies, where they're, in essence, siphoning off the existing tax base from the municipal government and using it to fund special projects. How rampant is this, not only in New York, but throughout the country? BETTINA DAMIANI : It's a terrible issue regarding not only the issue of financing, but making sure that there are quality jobs for Americans and, in our case, New Yorkers.

And it seems none of that was taken in consideration before this huge giveaway was done. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, that's one of the things I think Assembly member Brodsky is trying to investigate, because the city agency that engineered this deal, the Industrial Development Authority, apparently said that the Yankees were threatening to leave New York, of course, the most expensive media market in the country, the most desirable media market in the country. Neil, your sense of whether that was real or not? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah, I mean, and I think everyone knows that the Yankees were not going to move out of New York City, and it's kind of been an open secret for decades now, as long as George Steinbrenner has been demanding a stadium. Where is he going to go? The Yankees are not worth the, whatever, billion dollars that they're worth if they move to Charlotte, North Carolina. But that was the pretense. And the Yankees actually told the judge in a case trying to stop the demolition of the parks, \"Well, if you try and hold up this case, the Yankees could move.\" And, you know, they've been allowed to get away with this. And as Bettina was saying, elected officials never challenged them on this, until, you know, recently Brodsky is trying - been trying to track it down. JUAN GONZALEZ : And, of course, the final irony of all of this is, in the new stadium, once it gets built, as with all these stadiums, the ticket prices for the average baseball fan go through the roof. The prices in Yankee Stadium for box seats now are astronomical -- they're astronomical now, but what they will cost in the new stadium is unbelievable. Could you talk about some of the prices that they've released so far? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah. I mean, they're talking over, you know, $1,000, $2,000 a seat for some of the really premium seats. And I think what you're going to see is -- JUAN GONZALEZ : For one game? NEIL DEMAUSE : For one game, yes. For one game, yes, absolutely. For a whole season, you know, all bets are off. But I think, you know, what you're going to see the Yankees do, they've promised to keep bleacher tickets low. They've promised to keep a certain number of, you know, $25-or-less seats. I think what you're going to see them do is, especially with Brodsky and everyone else paying attention to the soaring costs, I think you're going to see the Yankees keep ticket prices low for the first season or two and, you know, try to say, \"OK, we're holding the line.\" And then, as everybody's clamoring to get tickets, two, three years down the road, you'll see those start to creep up. So, what I'm worried about isn't, next year, is it going to be affordable, but three years from now, is anybody going to be able to get a ticket? JUAN GONZALEZ : Right. And then, of course, the final irony with - because most of these stadiums have luxury boxes that are for corporations that go from $500,000 to $800,000, in the case of the Yankees, per year to rent these boxes, and of course, my newspaper, the Daily News , reported yesterday that in this deal, the City of New York arranged to have its own luxury box at Yankee Stadium available, presumably to city officials, as part of the deal for the financing. Bettina, your response to that? BETTINA DAMIANI : It's aptly coined the landlord suite. And it's just another example of how local elected officials almost seem to be void of feeling that they have responsibility to the public, because they're going to get nice seats, in the long run. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, I want to thank both of you for being with us, Bettina Damiani, the project director of Good Jobs New York, and Neil deMause, who's a writer and the author of Field of Schemes: How the Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money into Private Profit .\n\nBETTINA DAMIANI : Certainly. And it's not just the average New Yorker, as we learned through the Yankee Stadium project. Most New York City and New York State elected officials don't quite understand the issue of PILOTs, which is part of the crux of this issue. Essentially, PILOTs are payments in lieu of taxes. Instead of paying taxes, the Yankees are paying back their tax-free bonds. So, there's money that should be going into, as Assembly member Brodsky mentioned, the pot of money that would help pay for roads and schools and other services that New York City needs. Instead, it's just going - it's being completely diverted. And this, unfortunately, is a policy that is not done just with the Yankees but with a variety of other very large financial firms that have managed to make a special deal with New York City. JUAN GONZALEZ : And in this particular case, it was actually in the interest of the New York Yankees to have a very high assessment of their land, because that would allow them to be able to float more bonds and pay more PILOTs, which is their main goal here, is to raise as much money as possible to build their stadium, right? BETTINA DAMIANI : Exactly, and that's the irony. And that's one of the things that you mentioned in your article yesterday, is that in the South Bronx, the city was trying desperately to inflate the value of property, but not to benefit the larger community or the people that live in the neighborhood, but really for the sole benefit of the New York Yankees. JUAN GONZALEZ : And, Neil deMause, you've been writing now for quite a while about these stadium boondoggles. Virtually every major city in America is building a new arena or a new stadium of one kind, and most of them are using some degree or other of public financing. Could you give us a sense of the overall national picture? NEIL DEMAUSE : Sure. I mean, I think it's absolutely correct that every major and minor city is either building a stadium or arena or being asked to estimate somewhere around $2 billion a year of public money going into these buildings, a very, very small percentage of which comes back in terms of, you know, tax benefits or actually benefits to the cities. You know, when the Yankees and the Mets first announced their deals, Mayor Bloomberg said, \"Oh, you know, we don't make subsidies; we make investments, and we get our money back.\" At the time, it was announced, well, the Yankees and Mets are going to be paying for, you know, all the construction costs of the stadium. As you look at it and break down where they're getting tax breaks and where they're getting sort of hidden subsidies, the taxpayers wind up paying most of the cost. JUAN GONZALEZ : And, Congressman Kucinich, you originally had scheduled your hearing for this week but then decided to postpone it until September. Have you been in conversations with the City of New York and with the Yankees about them also testifying at your hearing? And what documents, specifically, are you trying to get from them now? REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, I could say that my subcommittee staff - and again, I'm the chair of the Domestic Policy Subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over this matter - and our subcommittee staff is in contact with officials of both the City of New York and the New York Yankees to discuss their potential appearance in front of our congressional subcommittee. I think that it's very important to understand that we're looking at a public policy matter here that relates not only to New York and not only to the Nets and the Atlantic Yard project, but it also relates to the whole country, as your other guests have said, because it's quite possible that there are billions of dollars in tax benefits that should be going to municipalities for the purposes of repairing their infrastructure and for schools and other things and that are instead being diverted for these private sports complexes. And the question is one of public policy, one of the IRS , and in the case of the New York Yankees, questions of securities law, because of the various amounts of the appraisal, $45 a square foot versus $275 a square foot, which have a bearing on the overall cost of the project. And if the cost of the project is inflated, that's going to be of interest to the SEC , as well as the IRS . JUAN GONZALEZ : And in terms of the - you're not, at this point, contemplating subpoenaing any records. You're figuring that they are going to be - they will provide you the documents and the information that you requested to avoid that potential. REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, you know, we generally assume that we'll get cooperation. I mean, certainly, as an investigative subcommittee, if we need to enforce that request with a subpoena, we have the ability to apply for that. But we're not at that point yet. And, you know, we're hopeful for cooperation on the part of all the parties involved. And I think that, again, this is a matter of serious public policy. When you have New York City, a great American city, which has all these capital infrastructure needs, and when payments get diverted, essentially - payments are not going into areas where the city expects the tax revenues will be coming from, and instead they're diverted in these payments in lieu of taxes, they're intensely serious matters that need to be discussed. And so, that's why the work that Mr. Brodsky is doing and your other guests are involved in is very significant. We're going to continue with our work on the Domestic Policy Subcommittee, and we'll be sure to keep you posted. JUAN GONZALEZ : OK. We're talking with Congressman Dennis Kucinich in Washington, and here also, Bettina Damiani of Good Jobs New York and Neil deMause, the author of Field of Schemes . We're going to return in a minute and to continue the conversation. And before Congressman Kucinich leaves, we also want to ask him about the hearings in Congress, the potential impeachment hearings. We'll be back in a minute. [break] JUAN GONZALEZ : We're talking about the use of public subsidies for sports stadiums. We're joined from Washington, D.C. by Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich. And here in New York, we have Bettina Damiani, the project director of Good Jobs New York, and Neil deMause, author of Field of Schemes: How the Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money into Private Profit . But, Congressman Kucinich, you've been leading the fight for impeachment, and I know you have to go very soon, so I wanted to ask you about an interview with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that aired on The View earlier this week. She was asked about impeachment. JOY BEHAR : You've ruled against impeaching George Bush and Dick Cheney, and now Kucinich is trying to pass that. Why do you insist on not impeaching these people, so that the world and America can really see the crimes that they've committed? REP . NANCY PELOSI : Well, I think that it - I think it was important, when I became Speaker - and it's, by the way, a very important position - President, Vice President, Speaker of the House - I saw it as my responsibility to try to bring a much divided country together to the extent that we could. I thought that impeachment would be divisive for the country. In terms of what we wanted - set out to do, we wanted to raise the minimum wage, give the biggest increase in veterans benefits to veterans in the seventy-seven-year history, then pass research for stem cell research, all of that. This week, we're going to pass equal pay for equal work. It has been a long time in coming - pay equity. We're going to pass legislations for product safety, for toys that children put in their - there's an agenda that you have to get done. You have to try to do it in a bipartisan way. The President has to sign it. If somebody had a crime that the President had committed, that would be a different story. JOY BEHAR : Can they still do it after he's out? BARBARA WALTERS : When we - when I interviewed you last year, you had just begun, and you were going to clean up the mess, remember? REP . NANCY PELOSI : And we did. BARBARA WALTERS : You look around this country, 75 percent of the country - forget George Bush - thinks that Congress is doing a lousy job. ELISABETH HASSELBECK : I think it's 91 percent now. REP . NANCY PELOSI : Well, I don't disagree with that, because largely it's predicated on ending the war in Iraq. That's the main question, and we were not successful. In our House of Representatives, I'm very proud of our members, because they voted overwhelmingly over and over again to bring the war to an end, bring the troops home safely and soon, sent it to the Senate, and it hits a dead end. But in terms of that particular standard, I would say I disapprove, as well. But we do - we passed some of the things I just mentioned, the energy bill. We worked in a bipartisan way, Innovation Agenda. We have to create jobs, expand healthcare, protect the American people and educate our children. And you can't do that if you're trying to impeach the President at the same time, unless you have the goods that this president committed crimes. JUAN GONZALEZ : That was House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Congressman Kucinich, your response to her take on the situation with impeachment? REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, now that I've heard that the Speaker is looking for evidence that crimes may have been committed, I certainly want to direct her attention to the thirty-five articles of impeachment that I presented, which assert quite directly that crimes have been committed, including taking this nation into a war, an illegal war, based on lies; including the deaths of over a million innocent Iraqis, which constitute a war crime; including wiretapping, rendition, torture, illegal detention. There are many examples of laws that have been broken. And the reason why the Judiciary Committee should hold a hearing on the impeachment itself is because there needs to be a public airing of this. So, I have a great deal of respect for Speaker Pelosi, and I think that since she made that statement on The View , there's an opportunity now for us to come forward and to lay all the facts out so that she can reconsider her decision not to permit the Judiciary Committee to proceed with a full impeachment hearing. I just want to state this, that I appreciate that she consented to a hearing on Friday. It was a six-hour hearing, over a dozen witnesses. Twenty-four members of Congress attended. It's being taken seriously. I think the idea that nothing can be done right now because we're on the eve of an election raises questions about our constitutional responsibility to be a check and balance to administration abuse of power. If in fact we're in a war that's based on lies, and we have thousands of troops whose lives are on the line every day, we owe it to them and we owe it to the American people to set straight the public record. And then, whether or not it results in the President being removed from office before the end of his term is another matter. I want to further say that with the possibility of a war in Iran in the offing, a war against Iran, a war that would be a result of a pre-emptive attack, much like the one that the United States launched against Iraq, it becomes very important that we hold this administration to the highest standard of having to verify the statements they make to take us into one war and to try to take us into another. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, Congressman Dennis Kucinich of Ohio, thank you, once again, for joining us. And we're going to continue the conversation here on the stadium issues with Bettina Damiani of Good Jobs New York and Neil deMause, author of Field of Schemes . I'd like to - again, getting back to the stadium deal, this Yankee Stadium is the most expensive stadium in the history of the United States. The actual cost is very hard to get your hands around, because there are some public infrastructure subsidies. But we're talking about a stadium that is going to be somewhere between one and two billion dollars, when you add up all of the actual costs, probably closer to two. And, Neil, could you talk about this - how the public expenditures are being used, even though we're being told that they're not being - public money is not being used directly for the stadium? NEIL DEMAUSE : Sure. I mean, it's something I've been trying to track ever since this was first announced three years ago. There is, as you mentioned, this infrastructure cost, where the public is paying for building new parks to replace the ones that were torn down to make way for the new stadium, paying for moving a water main and other things like that. JUAN GONZALEZ : And when you say parks that were torn down, because that was, itself, a big issue -- NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah, this -- JUAN GONZALEZ : - this is public park land, about a - what was it? Twenty acres or at least -- NEIL DEMAUSE : It was like twenty-two acres that was actually demolished. It was park that had been there even longer than Yankee Stadium that was demolished to make way for the new stadium. To make up for this, the city and state had to make sure that there was an equal amount of park land that was created. So they're knocking down the old stadium completely. Originally, the team was talking, \"Oh, we're going to save it as a museum.\" It's going to be gone starting next year, and they're going to put some ball fields there. And they've found some space down by the Harlem River where they're going to squeeze in some tennis courts, and sort of little patchwork of parks around different places. The public is paying for all that. The public is paying for the actual demolition of Yankee Stadium, is all going to be public. The public is paying a good chunk for building new parking garages for the Yankees, including one that will be used by the players and VIPs and various folks like that. And the team is getting all sorts of different tax breaks. As Bettina mentioned, they're not going to be paying property taxes. They're going to be getting mortgage-recording taxes. They're going to be getting these tax-exempt bonds that we've been talking about, which is actually a tremendous amount of money, if they get the new $300 million in bonds they're looking for. They're going to be talking about getting more than $300 million worth of tax breaks just on the bonds themselves. So when you add it all up, you get somewhere around $900 million worth of public money that's being spent just on Yankee Stadium. JUAN GONZALEZ : Bettina, those who advocate these stadiums say, \"Why not? This is economic development. It's creating jobs. It's keeping a sort of a -- the psychology of the city by having a professional sports team that the residents can root for.\" What's wrong with it? BETTINA DAMIANI : All the subsidies that Neil just listed. You would like to assume that the city and the state made a clear path to making sure that there were going to be jobs, good-paying jobs for New Yorkers, on the other end. That was going to be the investment, right? We see nothing. There's nothing that says a certain number of jobs has to be set aside for either local New York residents or local Bronx residents, or the number of jobs at all. The city has really washed their hands of making sure there's any accountability on jobs and clear benefits for New Yorkers on the other side of this project, which is very unfortunate. I mean, we're grateful for Congressman Kucinich and Assembly member Brodsky to get involved in this issue. Neither represent New York City, by the way. New York City elected officials - they're filling a void, because local elected officials in New York City have refused to get involved in this project. And we need them. We need them to make sure that the promises in the press releases actually turn out to be something that we can hold them accountable for. JUAN GONZALEZ : And you have, generally speaking, on this issue of tax-exempt financing for economic development, raised numerous questions over the years. It's been one of my favorite topics, how cities are siphoning off their tax bases to create special deals for developers, whether it's sports teams or private companies, where they're, in essence, siphoning off the existing tax base from the municipal government and using it to fund special projects. How rampant is this, not only in New York, but throughout the country? BETTINA DAMIANI : It's a terrible issue regarding not only the issue of financing, but making sure that there are quality jobs for Americans and, in our case, New Yorkers. There's a thing called the economic war among the states, where it seems that so many municipalities and states are worried about fighting one another for the headquarters of a particular agency that they're willing to set aside basic fiscal commonsense and not making sure that there are real quality jobs on the ends of these big deals. Site consultants are prevalent throughout the country that have really manufactured this process, and they make it seem like if the Yankees didn't get their subsidy or if the New York Stock Exchange didn't get a subsidy, they were going to flee somewhere else, without taking into consideration or doing some real due diligence. Where were the Yankees going to go? The Yankees are famous because they're in the Bronx. We have a large media here. We have an incredible fan base here. And it seems none of that was taken in consideration before this huge giveaway was done. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, that's one of the things I think Assembly member Brodsky is trying to investigate, because the city agency that engineered this deal, the Industrial Development Authority, apparently said that the Yankees were threatening to leave New York, of course, the most expensive media market in the country, the most desirable media market in the country. Neil, your sense of whether that was real or not? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah, I mean, and I think everyone knows that the Yankees were not going to move out of New York City, and it's kind of been an open secret for decades now, as long as George Steinbrenner has been demanding a stadium. Where is he going to go? The Yankees are not worth the, whatever, billion dollars that they're worth if they move to Charlotte, North Carolina. But that was the pretense.

There are many examples of laws that have been broken. And the reason why the Judiciary Committee should hold a hearing on the impeachment itself is because there needs to be a public airing of this. So, I have a great deal of respect for Speaker Pelosi, and I think that since she made that statement on The View , there's an opportunity now for us to come forward and to lay all the facts out so that she can reconsider her decision not to permit the Judiciary Committee to proceed with a full impeachment hearing. I just want to state this, that I appreciate that she consented to a hearing on Friday. It was a six-hour hearing, over a dozen witnesses. Twenty-four members of Congress attended. It's being taken seriously. I think the idea that nothing can be done right now because we're on the eve of an election raises questions about our constitutional responsibility to be a check and balance to administration abuse of power. If in fact we're in a war that's based on lies, and we have thousands of troops whose lives are on the line every day, we owe it to them and we owe it to the American people to set straight the public record. And then, whether or not it results in the President being removed from office before the end of his term is another matter. I want to further say that with the possibility of a war in Iran in the offing, a war against Iran, a war that would be a result of a pre-emptive attack, much like the one that the United States launched against Iraq, it becomes very important that we hold this administration to the highest standard of having to verify the statements they make to take us into one war and to try to take us into another. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, Congressman Dennis Kucinich of Ohio, thank you, once again, for joining us. And we're going to continue the conversation here on the stadium issues with Bettina Damiani of Good Jobs New York and Neil deMause, author of Field of Schemes . I'd like to - again, getting back to the stadium deal, this Yankee Stadium is the most expensive stadium in the history of the United States. The actual cost is very hard to get your hands around, because there are some public infrastructure subsidies. But we're talking about a stadium that is going to be somewhere between one and two billion dollars, when you add up all of the actual costs, probably closer to two. And, Neil, could you talk about this - how the public expenditures are being used, even though we're being told that they're not being - public money is not being used directly for the stadium? NEIL DEMAUSE : Sure. I mean, it's something I've been trying to track ever since this was first announced three years ago. There is, as you mentioned, this infrastructure cost, where the public is paying for building new parks to replace the ones that were torn down to make way for the new stadium, paying for moving a water main and other things like that. JUAN GONZALEZ : And when you say parks that were torn down, because that was, itself, a big issue -- NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah, this -- JUAN GONZALEZ : - this is public park land, about a - what was it? Twenty acres or at least -- NEIL DEMAUSE : It was like twenty-two acres that was actually demolished. It was park that had been there even longer than Yankee Stadium that was demolished to make way for the new stadium. To make up for this, the city and state had to make sure that there was an equal amount of park land that was created. So they're knocking down the old stadium completely. Originally, the team was talking, \"Oh, we're going to save it as a museum.\" It's going to be gone starting next year, and they're going to put some ball fields there. And they've found some space down by the Harlem River where they're going to squeeze in some tennis courts, and sort of little patchwork of parks around different places. The public is paying for all that. The public is paying for the actual demolition of Yankee Stadium, is all going to be public. The public is paying a good chunk for building new parking garages for the Yankees, including one that will be used by the players and VIPs and various folks like that. And the team is getting all sorts of different tax breaks. As Bettina mentioned, they're not going to be paying property taxes. They're going to be getting mortgage-recording taxes. They're going to be getting these tax-exempt bonds that we've been talking about, which is actually a tremendous amount of money, if they get the new $300 million in bonds they're looking for. They're going to be talking about getting more than $300 million worth of tax breaks just on the bonds themselves. So when you add it all up, you get somewhere around $900 million worth of public money that's being spent just on Yankee Stadium. JUAN GONZALEZ : Bettina, those who advocate these stadiums say, \"Why not? This is economic development. It's creating jobs. It's keeping a sort of a -- the psychology of the city by having a professional sports team that the residents can root for.\" What's wrong with it? BETTINA DAMIANI : All the subsidies that Neil just listed. You would like to assume that the city and the state made a clear path to making sure that there were going to be jobs, good-paying jobs for New Yorkers, on the other end. That was going to be the investment, right? We see nothing. There's nothing that says a certain number of jobs has to be set aside for either local New York residents or local Bronx residents, or the number of jobs at all. The city has really washed their hands of making sure there's any accountability on jobs and clear benefits for New Yorkers on the other side of this project, which is very unfortunate. I mean, we're grateful for Congressman Kucinich and Assembly member Brodsky to get involved in this issue. Neither represent New York City, by the way. New York City elected officials - they're filling a void, because local elected officials in New York City have refused to get involved in this project. And we need them. We need them to make sure that the promises in the press releases actually turn out to be something that we can hold them accountable for. JUAN GONZALEZ : And you have, generally speaking, on this issue of tax-exempt financing for economic development, raised numerous questions over the years. It's been one of my favorite topics, how cities are siphoning off their tax bases to create special deals for developers, whether it's sports teams or private companies, where they're, in essence, siphoning off the existing tax base from the municipal government and using it to fund special projects. How rampant is this, not only in New York, but throughout the country? BETTINA DAMIANI : It's a terrible issue regarding not only the issue of financing, but making sure that there are quality jobs for Americans and, in our case, New Yorkers. There's a thing called the economic war among the states, where it seems that so many municipalities and states are worried about fighting one another for the headquarters of a particular agency that they're willing to set aside basic fiscal commonsense and not making sure that there are real quality jobs on the ends of these big deals. Site consultants are prevalent throughout the country that have really manufactured this process, and they make it seem like if the Yankees didn't get their subsidy or if the New York Stock Exchange didn't get a subsidy, they were going to flee somewhere else, without taking into consideration or doing some real due diligence. Where were the Yankees going to go? The Yankees are famous because they're in the Bronx. We have a large media here. We have an incredible fan base here. And it seems none of that was taken in consideration before this huge giveaway was done. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, that's one of the things I think Assembly member Brodsky is trying to investigate, because the city agency that engineered this deal, the Industrial Development Authority, apparently said that the Yankees were threatening to leave New York, of course, the most expensive media market in the country, the most desirable media market in the country. Neil, your sense of whether that was real or not? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah, I mean, and I think everyone knows that the Yankees were not going to move out of New York City, and it's kind of been an open secret for decades now, as long as George Steinbrenner has been demanding a stadium. Where is he going to go? The Yankees are not worth the, whatever, billion dollars that they're worth if they move to Charlotte, North Carolina. But that was the pretense. And the Yankees actually told the judge in a case trying to stop the demolition of the parks, \"Well, if you try and hold up this case, the Yankees could move.\" And, you know, they've been allowed to get away with this. And as Bettina was saying, elected officials never challenged them on this, until, you know, recently Brodsky is trying - been trying to track it down. JUAN GONZALEZ : And, of course, the final irony of all of this is, in the new stadium, once it gets built, as with all these stadiums, the ticket prices for the average baseball fan go through the roof. The prices in Yankee Stadium for box seats now are astronomical -- they're astronomical now, but what they will cost in the new stadium is unbelievable. Could you talk about some of the prices that they've released so far? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah. I mean, they're talking over, you know, $1,000, $2,000 a seat for some of the really premium seats. And I think what you're going to see is -- JUAN GONZALEZ : For one game? NEIL DEMAUSE : For one game, yes. For one game, yes, absolutely. For a whole season, you know, all bets are off. But I think, you know, what you're going to see the Yankees do, they've promised to keep bleacher tickets low. They've promised to keep a certain number of, you know, $25-or-less seats. I think what you're going to see them do is, especially with Brodsky and everyone else paying attention to the soaring costs, I think you're going to see the Yankees keep ticket prices low for the first season or two and, you know, try to say, \"OK, we're holding the line.\" And then, as everybody's clamoring to get tickets, two, three years down the road, you'll see those start to creep up. So, what I'm worried about isn't, next year, is it going to be affordable, but three years from now, is anybody going to be able to get a ticket? JUAN GONZALEZ : Right. And then, of course, the final irony with - because most of these stadiums have luxury boxes that are for corporations that go from $500,000 to $800,000, in the case of the Yankees, per year to rent these boxes, and of course, my newspaper, the Daily News , reported yesterday that in this deal, the City of New York arranged to have its own luxury box at Yankee Stadium available, presumably to city officials, as part of the deal for the financing. Bettina, your response to that? BETTINA DAMIANI : It's aptly coined the landlord suite. And it's just another example of how local elected officials almost seem to be void of feeling that they have responsibility to the public, because they're going to get nice seats, in the long run. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, I want to thank both of you for being with us, Bettina Damiani, the project director of Good Jobs New York, and Neil deMause, who's a writer and the author of Field of Schemes: How the Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money into Private Profit .\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : And in this particular case, it was actually in the interest of the New York Yankees to have a very high assessment of their land, because that would allow them to be able to float more bonds and pay more PILOTs, which is their main goal here, is to raise as much money as possible to build their stadium, right? BETTINA DAMIANI : Exactly, and that's the irony. And that's one of the things that you mentioned in your article yesterday, is that in the South Bronx, the city was trying desperately to inflate the value of property, but not to benefit the larger community or the people that live in the neighborhood, but really for the sole benefit of the New York Yankees. JUAN GONZALEZ : And, Neil deMause, you've been writing now for quite a while about these stadium boondoggles. Virtually every major city in America is building a new arena or a new stadium of one kind, and most of them are using some degree or other of public financing. Could you give us a sense of the overall national picture? NEIL DEMAUSE : Sure. I mean, I think it's absolutely correct that every major and minor city is either building a stadium or arena or being asked to estimate somewhere around $2 billion a year of public money going into these buildings, a very, very small percentage of which comes back in terms of, you know, tax benefits or actually benefits to the cities. You know, when the Yankees and the Mets first announced their deals, Mayor Bloomberg said, \"Oh, you know, we don't make subsidies; we make investments, and we get our money back.\" At the time, it was announced, well, the Yankees and Mets are going to be paying for, you know, all the construction costs of the stadium. As you look at it and break down where they're getting tax breaks and where they're getting sort of hidden subsidies, the taxpayers wind up paying most of the cost. JUAN GONZALEZ : And, Congressman Kucinich, you originally had scheduled your hearing for this week but then decided to postpone it until September. Have you been in conversations with the City of New York and with the Yankees about them also testifying at your hearing? And what documents, specifically, are you trying to get from them now? REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, I could say that my subcommittee staff - and again, I'm the chair of the Domestic Policy Subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over this matter - and our subcommittee staff is in contact with officials of both the City of New York and the New York Yankees to discuss their potential appearance in front of our congressional subcommittee. I think that it's very important to understand that we're looking at a public policy matter here that relates not only to New York and not only to the Nets and the Atlantic Yard project, but it also relates to the whole country, as your other guests have said, because it's quite possible that there are billions of dollars in tax benefits that should be going to municipalities for the purposes of repairing their infrastructure and for schools and other things and that are instead being diverted for these private sports complexes. And the question is one of public policy, one of the IRS , and in the case of the New York Yankees, questions of securities law, because of the various amounts of the appraisal, $45 a square foot versus $275 a square foot, which have a bearing on the overall cost of the project. And if the cost of the project is inflated, that's going to be of interest to the SEC , as well as the IRS . JUAN GONZALEZ : And in terms of the - you're not, at this point, contemplating subpoenaing any records. You're figuring that they are going to be - they will provide you the documents and the information that you requested to avoid that potential. REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, you know, we generally assume that we'll get cooperation. I mean, certainly, as an investigative subcommittee, if we need to enforce that request with a subpoena, we have the ability to apply for that. But we're not at that point yet. And, you know, we're hopeful for cooperation on the part of all the parties involved. And I think that, again, this is a matter of serious public policy. When you have New York City, a great American city, which has all these capital infrastructure needs, and when payments get diverted, essentially - payments are not going into areas where the city expects the tax revenues will be coming from, and instead they're diverted in these payments in lieu of taxes, they're intensely serious matters that need to be discussed. And so, that's why the work that Mr. Brodsky is doing and your other guests are involved in is very significant. We're going to continue with our work on the Domestic Policy Subcommittee, and we'll be sure to keep you posted. JUAN GONZALEZ : OK. We're talking with Congressman Dennis Kucinich in Washington, and here also, Bettina Damiani of Good Jobs New York and Neil deMause, the author of Field of Schemes . We're going to return in a minute and to continue the conversation. And before Congressman Kucinich leaves, we also want to ask him about the hearings in Congress, the potential impeachment hearings. We'll be back in a minute. [break] JUAN GONZALEZ : We're talking about the use of public subsidies for sports stadiums. We're joined from Washington, D.C. by Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich. And here in New York, we have Bettina Damiani, the project director of Good Jobs New York, and Neil deMause, author of Field of Schemes: How the Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money into Private Profit . But, Congressman Kucinich, you've been leading the fight for impeachment, and I know you have to go very soon, so I wanted to ask you about an interview with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that aired on The View earlier this week. She was asked about impeachment. JOY BEHAR : You've ruled against impeaching George Bush and Dick Cheney, and now Kucinich is trying to pass that. Why do you insist on not impeaching these people, so that the world and America can really see the crimes that they've committed? REP . NANCY PELOSI : Well, I think that it - I think it was important, when I became Speaker - and it's, by the way, a very important position - President, Vice President, Speaker of the House - I saw it as my responsibility to try to bring a much divided country together to the extent that we could. I thought that impeachment would be divisive for the country. In terms of what we wanted - set out to do, we wanted to raise the minimum wage, give the biggest increase in veterans benefits to veterans in the seventy-seven-year history, then pass research for stem cell research, all of that. This week, we're going to pass equal pay for equal work. It has been a long time in coming - pay equity. We're going to pass legislations for product safety, for toys that children put in their - there's an agenda that you have to get done. You have to try to do it in a bipartisan way. The President has to sign it. If somebody had a crime that the President had committed, that would be a different story. JOY BEHAR : Can they still do it after he's out? BARBARA WALTERS : When we - when I interviewed you last year, you had just begun, and you were going to clean up the mess, remember? REP . NANCY PELOSI : And we did. BARBARA WALTERS : You look around this country, 75 percent of the country - forget George Bush - thinks that Congress is doing a lousy job. ELISABETH HASSELBECK : I think it's 91 percent now. REP . NANCY PELOSI : Well, I don't disagree with that, because largely it's predicated on ending the war in Iraq. That's the main question, and we were not successful. In our House of Representatives, I'm very proud of our members, because they voted overwhelmingly over and over again to bring the war to an end, bring the troops home safely and soon, sent it to the Senate, and it hits a dead end. But in terms of that particular standard, I would say I disapprove, as well. But we do - we passed some of the things I just mentioned, the energy bill. We worked in a bipartisan way, Innovation Agenda. We have to create jobs, expand healthcare, protect the American people and educate our children. And you can't do that if you're trying to impeach the President at the same time, unless you have the goods that this president committed crimes. JUAN GONZALEZ : That was House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Congressman Kucinich, your response to her take on the situation with impeachment? REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, now that I've heard that the Speaker is looking for evidence that crimes may have been committed, I certainly want to direct her attention to the thirty-five articles of impeachment that I presented, which assert quite directly that crimes have been committed, including taking this nation into a war, an illegal war, based on lies; including the deaths of over a million innocent Iraqis, which constitute a war crime; including wiretapping, rendition, torture, illegal detention. There are many examples of laws that have been broken. And the reason why the Judiciary Committee should hold a hearing on the impeachment itself is because there needs to be a public airing of this. So, I have a great deal of respect for Speaker Pelosi, and I think that since she made that statement on The View , there's an opportunity now for us to come forward and to lay all the facts out so that she can reconsider her decision not to permit the Judiciary Committee to proceed with a full impeachment hearing. I just want to state this, that I appreciate that she consented to a hearing on Friday. It was a six-hour hearing, over a dozen witnesses. Twenty-four members of Congress attended. It's being taken seriously. I think the idea that nothing can be done right now because we're on the eve of an election raises questions about our constitutional responsibility to be a check and balance to administration abuse of power. If in fact we're in a war that's based on lies, and we have thousands of troops whose lives are on the line every day, we owe it to them and we owe it to the American people to set straight the public record. And then, whether or not it results in the President being removed from office before the end of his term is another matter. I want to further say that with the possibility of a war in Iran in the offing, a war against Iran, a war that would be a result of a pre-emptive attack, much like the one that the United States launched against Iraq, it becomes very important that we hold this administration to the highest standard of having to verify the statements they make to take us into one war and to try to take us into another. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, Congressman Dennis Kucinich of Ohio, thank you, once again, for joining us. And we're going to continue the conversation here on the stadium issues with Bettina Damiani of Good Jobs New York and Neil deMause, author of Field of Schemes . I'd like to - again, getting back to the stadium deal, this Yankee Stadium is the most expensive stadium in the history of the United States. The actual cost is very hard to get your hands around, because there are some public infrastructure subsidies. But we're talking about a stadium that is going to be somewhere between one and two billion dollars, when you add up all of the actual costs, probably closer to two.

And the question is one of public policy, one of the IRS , and in the case of the New York Yankees, questions of securities law, because of the various amounts of the appraisal, $45 a square foot versus $275 a square foot, which have a bearing on the overall cost of the project. And if the cost of the project is inflated, that's going to be of interest to the SEC , as well as the IRS . JUAN GONZALEZ : And in terms of the - you're not, at this point, contemplating subpoenaing any records. You're figuring that they are going to be - they will provide you the documents and the information that you requested to avoid that potential. REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, you know, we generally assume that we'll get cooperation. I mean, certainly, as an investigative subcommittee, if we need to enforce that request with a subpoena, we have the ability to apply for that. But we're not at that point yet. And, you know, we're hopeful for cooperation on the part of all the parties involved. And I think that, again, this is a matter of serious public policy. When you have New York City, a great American city, which has all these capital infrastructure needs, and when payments get diverted, essentially - payments are not going into areas where the city expects the tax revenues will be coming from, and instead they're diverted in these payments in lieu of taxes, they're intensely serious matters that need to be discussed. And so, that's why the work that Mr. Brodsky is doing and your other guests are involved in is very significant. We're going to continue with our work on the Domestic Policy Subcommittee, and we'll be sure to keep you posted. JUAN GONZALEZ : OK. We're talking with Congressman Dennis Kucinich in Washington, and here also, Bettina Damiani of Good Jobs New York and Neil deMause, the author of Field of Schemes . We're going to return in a minute and to continue the conversation. And before Congressman Kucinich leaves, we also want to ask him about the hearings in Congress, the potential impeachment hearings. We'll be back in a minute. [break] JUAN GONZALEZ : We're talking about the use of public subsidies for sports stadiums. We're joined from Washington, D.C. by Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich. And here in New York, we have Bettina Damiani, the project director of Good Jobs New York, and Neil deMause, author of Field of Schemes: How the Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money into Private Profit . But, Congressman Kucinich, you've been leading the fight for impeachment, and I know you have to go very soon, so I wanted to ask you about an interview with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that aired on The View earlier this week. She was asked about impeachment. JOY BEHAR : You've ruled against impeaching George Bush and Dick Cheney, and now Kucinich is trying to pass that. Why do you insist on not impeaching these people, so that the world and America can really see the crimes that they've committed? REP . NANCY PELOSI : Well, I think that it - I think it was important, when I became Speaker - and it's, by the way, a very important position - President, Vice President, Speaker of the House - I saw it as my responsibility to try to bring a much divided country together to the extent that we could. I thought that impeachment would be divisive for the country. In terms of what we wanted - set out to do, we wanted to raise the minimum wage, give the biggest increase in veterans benefits to veterans in the seventy-seven-year history, then pass research for stem cell research, all of that. This week, we're going to pass equal pay for equal work. It has been a long time in coming - pay equity. We're going to pass legislations for product safety, for toys that children put in their - there's an agenda that you have to get done. You have to try to do it in a bipartisan way. The President has to sign it. If somebody had a crime that the President had committed, that would be a different story. JOY BEHAR : Can they still do it after he's out? BARBARA WALTERS : When we - when I interviewed you last year, you had just begun, and you were going to clean up the mess, remember? REP . NANCY PELOSI : And we did. BARBARA WALTERS : You look around this country, 75 percent of the country - forget George Bush - thinks that Congress is doing a lousy job. ELISABETH HASSELBECK : I think it's 91 percent now. REP . NANCY PELOSI : Well, I don't disagree with that, because largely it's predicated on ending the war in Iraq. That's the main question, and we were not successful. In our House of Representatives, I'm very proud of our members, because they voted overwhelmingly over and over again to bring the war to an end, bring the troops home safely and soon, sent it to the Senate, and it hits a dead end. But in terms of that particular standard, I would say I disapprove, as well. But we do - we passed some of the things I just mentioned, the energy bill. We worked in a bipartisan way, Innovation Agenda. We have to create jobs, expand healthcare, protect the American people and educate our children. And you can't do that if you're trying to impeach the President at the same time, unless you have the goods that this president committed crimes. JUAN GONZALEZ : That was House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Congressman Kucinich, your response to her take on the situation with impeachment? REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, now that I've heard that the Speaker is looking for evidence that crimes may have been committed, I certainly want to direct her attention to the thirty-five articles of impeachment that I presented, which assert quite directly that crimes have been committed, including taking this nation into a war, an illegal war, based on lies; including the deaths of over a million innocent Iraqis, which constitute a war crime; including wiretapping, rendition, torture, illegal detention. There are many examples of laws that have been broken. And the reason why the Judiciary Committee should hold a hearing on the impeachment itself is because there needs to be a public airing of this. So, I have a great deal of respect for Speaker Pelosi, and I think that since she made that statement on The View , there's an opportunity now for us to come forward and to lay all the facts out so that she can reconsider her decision not to permit the Judiciary Committee to proceed with a full impeachment hearing. I just want to state this, that I appreciate that she consented to a hearing on Friday. It was a six-hour hearing, over a dozen witnesses. Twenty-four members of Congress attended. It's being taken seriously. I think the idea that nothing can be done right now because we're on the eve of an election raises questions about our constitutional responsibility to be a check and balance to administration abuse of power. If in fact we're in a war that's based on lies, and we have thousands of troops whose lives are on the line every day, we owe it to them and we owe it to the American people to set straight the public record. And then, whether or not it results in the President being removed from office before the end of his term is another matter. I want to further say that with the possibility of a war in Iran in the offing, a war against Iran, a war that would be a result of a pre-emptive attack, much like the one that the United States launched against Iraq, it becomes very important that we hold this administration to the highest standard of having to verify the statements they make to take us into one war and to try to take us into another. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, Congressman Dennis Kucinich of Ohio, thank you, once again, for joining us. And we're going to continue the conversation here on the stadium issues with Bettina Damiani of Good Jobs New York and Neil deMause, author of Field of Schemes . I'd like to - again, getting back to the stadium deal, this Yankee Stadium is the most expensive stadium in the history of the United States. The actual cost is very hard to get your hands around, because there are some public infrastructure subsidies. But we're talking about a stadium that is going to be somewhere between one and two billion dollars, when you add up all of the actual costs, probably closer to two. And, Neil, could you talk about this - how the public expenditures are being used, even though we're being told that they're not being - public money is not being used directly for the stadium? NEIL DEMAUSE : Sure. I mean, it's something I've been trying to track ever since this was first announced three years ago. There is, as you mentioned, this infrastructure cost, where the public is paying for building new parks to replace the ones that were torn down to make way for the new stadium, paying for moving a water main and other things like that. JUAN GONZALEZ : And when you say parks that were torn down, because that was, itself, a big issue -- NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah, this -- JUAN GONZALEZ : - this is public park land, about a - what was it? Twenty acres or at least -- NEIL DEMAUSE : It was like twenty-two acres that was actually demolished. It was park that had been there even longer than Yankee Stadium that was demolished to make way for the new stadium. To make up for this, the city and state had to make sure that there was an equal amount of park land that was created. So they're knocking down the old stadium completely. Originally, the team was talking, \"Oh, we're going to save it as a museum.\" It's going to be gone starting next year, and they're going to put some ball fields there. And they've found some space down by the Harlem River where they're going to squeeze in some tennis courts, and sort of little patchwork of parks around different places. The public is paying for all that. The public is paying for the actual demolition of Yankee Stadium, is all going to be public. The public is paying a good chunk for building new parking garages for the Yankees, including one that will be used by the players and VIPs and various folks like that. And the team is getting all sorts of different tax breaks. As Bettina mentioned, they're not going to be paying property taxes. They're going to be getting mortgage-recording taxes. They're going to be getting these tax-exempt bonds that we've been talking about, which is actually a tremendous amount of money, if they get the new $300 million in bonds they're looking for. They're going to be talking about getting more than $300 million worth of tax breaks just on the bonds themselves. So when you add it all up, you get somewhere around $900 million worth of public money that's being spent just on Yankee Stadium. JUAN GONZALEZ : Bettina, those who advocate these stadiums say, \"Why not? This is economic development. It's creating jobs. It's keeping a sort of a -- the psychology of the city by having a professional sports team that the residents can root for.\" What's wrong with it? BETTINA DAMIANI : All the subsidies that Neil just listed. You would like to assume that the city and the state made a clear path to making sure that there were going to be jobs, good-paying jobs for New Yorkers, on the other end. That was going to be the investment, right? We see nothing. There's nothing that says a certain number of jobs has to be set aside for either local New York residents or local Bronx residents, or the number of jobs at all. The city has really washed their hands of making sure there's any accountability on jobs and clear benefits for New Yorkers on the other side of this project, which is very unfortunate. I mean, we're grateful for Congressman Kucinich and Assembly member Brodsky to get involved in this issue. Neither represent New York City, by the way. New York City elected officials - they're filling a void, because local elected officials in New York City have refused to get involved in this project. And we need them. We need them to make sure that the promises in the press releases actually turn out to be something that we can hold them accountable for. JUAN GONZALEZ : And you have, generally speaking, on this issue of tax-exempt financing for economic development, raised numerous questions over the years. It's been one of my favorite topics, how cities are siphoning off their tax bases to create special deals for developers, whether it's sports teams or private companies, where they're, in essence, siphoning off the existing tax base from the municipal government and using it to fund special projects. How rampant is this, not only in New York, but throughout the country? BETTINA DAMIANI : It's a terrible issue regarding not only the issue of financing, but making sure that there are quality jobs for Americans and, in our case, New Yorkers. There's a thing called the economic war among the states, where it seems that so many municipalities and states are worried about fighting one another for the headquarters of a particular agency that they're willing to set aside basic fiscal commonsense and not making sure that there are real quality jobs on the ends of these big deals. Site consultants are prevalent throughout the country that have really manufactured this process, and they make it seem like if the Yankees didn't get their subsidy or if the New York Stock Exchange didn't get a subsidy, they were going to flee somewhere else, without taking into consideration or doing some real due diligence. Where were the Yankees going to go? The Yankees are famous because they're in the Bronx. We have a large media here. We have an incredible fan base here. And it seems none of that was taken in consideration before this huge giveaway was done. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, that's one of the things I think Assembly member Brodsky is trying to investigate, because the city agency that engineered this deal, the Industrial Development Authority, apparently said that the Yankees were threatening to leave New York, of course, the most expensive media market in the country, the most desirable media market in the country. Neil, your sense of whether that was real or not? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah, I mean, and I think everyone knows that the Yankees were not going to move out of New York City, and it's kind of been an open secret for decades now, as long as George Steinbrenner has been demanding a stadium. Where is he going to go? The Yankees are not worth the, whatever, billion dollars that they're worth if they move to Charlotte, North Carolina. But that was the pretense. And the Yankees actually told the judge in a case trying to stop the demolition of the parks, \"Well, if you try and hold up this case, the Yankees could move.\" And, you know, they've been allowed to get away with this. And as Bettina was saying, elected officials never challenged them on this, until, you know, recently Brodsky is trying - been trying to track it down. JUAN GONZALEZ : And, of course, the final irony of all of this is, in the new stadium, once it gets built, as with all these stadiums, the ticket prices for the average baseball fan go through the roof. The prices in Yankee Stadium for box seats now are astronomical -- they're astronomical now, but what they will cost in the new stadium is unbelievable. Could you talk about some of the prices that they've released so far? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah. I mean, they're talking over, you know, $1,000, $2,000 a seat for some of the really premium seats. And I think what you're going to see is -- JUAN GONZALEZ : For one game? NEIL DEMAUSE : For one game, yes. For one game, yes, absolutely. For a whole season, you know, all bets are off. But I think, you know, what you're going to see the Yankees do, they've promised to keep bleacher tickets low. They've promised to keep a certain number of, you know, $25-or-less seats. I think what you're going to see them do is, especially with Brodsky and everyone else paying attention to the soaring costs, I think you're going to see the Yankees keep ticket prices low for the first season or two and, you know, try to say, \"OK, we're holding the line.\" And then, as everybody's clamoring to get tickets, two, three years down the road, you'll see those start to creep up. So, what I'm worried about isn't, next year, is it going to be affordable, but three years from now, is anybody going to be able to get a ticket? JUAN GONZALEZ : Right. And then, of course, the final irony with - because most of these stadiums have luxury boxes that are for corporations that go from $500,000 to $800,000, in the case of the Yankees, per year to rent these boxes, and of course, my newspaper, the Daily News , reported yesterday that in this deal, the City of New York arranged to have its own luxury box at Yankee Stadium available, presumably to city officials, as part of the deal for the financing. Bettina, your response to that? BETTINA DAMIANI : It's aptly coined the landlord suite. And it's just another example of how local elected officials almost seem to be void of feeling that they have responsibility to the public, because they're going to get nice seats, in the long run. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, I want to thank both of you for being with us, Bettina Damiani, the project director of Good Jobs New York, and Neil deMause, who's a writer and the author of Field of Schemes: How the Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money into Private Profit .\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : And, Neil deMause, you've been writing now for quite a while about these stadium boondoggles. Virtually every major city in America is building a new arena or a new stadium of one kind, and most of them are using some degree or other of public financing. Could you give us a sense of the overall national picture? NEIL DEMAUSE : Sure. I mean, I think it's absolutely correct that every major and minor city is either building a stadium or arena or being asked to estimate somewhere around $2 billion a year of public money going into these buildings, a very, very small percentage of which comes back in terms of, you know, tax benefits or actually benefits to the cities. You know, when the Yankees and the Mets first announced their deals, Mayor Bloomberg said, \"Oh, you know, we don't make subsidies; we make investments, and we get our money back.\" At the time, it was announced, well, the Yankees and Mets are going to be paying for, you know, all the construction costs of the stadium. As you look at it and break down where they're getting tax breaks and where they're getting sort of hidden subsidies, the taxpayers wind up paying most of the cost. JUAN GONZALEZ : And, Congressman Kucinich, you originally had scheduled your hearing for this week but then decided to postpone it until September. Have you been in conversations with the City of New York and with the Yankees about them also testifying at your hearing? And what documents, specifically, are you trying to get from them now? REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, I could say that my subcommittee staff - and again, I'm the chair of the Domestic Policy Subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over this matter - and our subcommittee staff is in contact with officials of both the City of New York and the New York Yankees to discuss their potential appearance in front of our congressional subcommittee. I think that it's very important to understand that we're looking at a public policy matter here that relates not only to New York and not only to the Nets and the Atlantic Yard project, but it also relates to the whole country, as your other guests have said, because it's quite possible that there are billions of dollars in tax benefits that should be going to municipalities for the purposes of repairing their infrastructure and for schools and other things and that are instead being diverted for these private sports complexes. And the question is one of public policy, one of the IRS , and in the case of the New York Yankees, questions of securities law, because of the various amounts of the appraisal, $45 a square foot versus $275 a square foot, which have a bearing on the overall cost of the project. And if the cost of the project is inflated, that's going to be of interest to the SEC , as well as the IRS . JUAN GONZALEZ : And in terms of the - you're not, at this point, contemplating subpoenaing any records. You're figuring that they are going to be - they will provide you the documents and the information that you requested to avoid that potential. REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, you know, we generally assume that we'll get cooperation. I mean, certainly, as an investigative subcommittee, if we need to enforce that request with a subpoena, we have the ability to apply for that. But we're not at that point yet. And, you know, we're hopeful for cooperation on the part of all the parties involved. And I think that, again, this is a matter of serious public policy.

And as Bettina was saying, elected officials never challenged them on this, until, you know, recently Brodsky is trying - been trying to track it down. JUAN GONZALEZ : And, of course, the final irony of all of this is, in the new stadium, once it gets built, as with all these stadiums, the ticket prices for the average baseball fan go through the roof. The prices in Yankee Stadium for box seats now are astronomical -- they're astronomical now, but what they will cost in the new stadium is unbelievable. Could you talk about some of the prices that they've released so far? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah. I mean, they're talking over, you know, $1,000, $2,000 a seat for some of the really premium seats. And I think what you're going to see is -- JUAN GONZALEZ : For one game? NEIL DEMAUSE : For one game, yes. For one game, yes, absolutely. For a whole season, you know, all bets are off. But I think, you know, what you're going to see the Yankees do, they've promised to keep bleacher tickets low. They've promised to keep a certain number of, you know, $25-or-less seats. I think what you're going to see them do is, especially with Brodsky and everyone else paying attention to the soaring costs, I think you're going to see the Yankees keep ticket prices low for the first season or two and, you know, try to say, \"OK, we're holding the line.\" And then, as everybody's clamoring to get tickets, two, three years down the road, you'll see those start to creep up. So, what I'm worried about isn't, next year, is it going to be affordable, but three years from now, is anybody going to be able to get a ticket? JUAN GONZALEZ : Right. And then, of course, the final irony with - because most of these stadiums have luxury boxes that are for corporations that go from $500,000 to $800,000, in the case of the Yankees, per year to rent these boxes, and of course, my newspaper, the Daily News , reported yesterday that in this deal, the City of New York arranged to have its own luxury box at Yankee Stadium available, presumably to city officials, as part of the deal for the financing. Bettina, your response to that? BETTINA DAMIANI : It's aptly coined the landlord suite. And it's just another example of how local elected officials almost seem to be void of feeling that they have responsibility to the public, because they're going to get nice seats, in the long run. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, I want to thank both of you for being with us, Bettina Damiani, the project director of Good Jobs New York, and Neil deMause, who's a writer and the author of Field of Schemes: How the Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money into Private Profit .\n\nNEIL DEMAUSE : Sure. I mean, I think it's absolutely correct that every major and minor city is either building a stadium or arena or being asked to estimate somewhere around $2 billion a year of public money going into these buildings, a very, very small percentage of which comes back in terms of, you know, tax benefits or actually benefits to the cities. You know, when the Yankees and the Mets first announced their deals, Mayor Bloomberg said, \"Oh, you know, we don't make subsidies; we make investments, and we get our money back.\" At the time, it was announced, well, the Yankees and Mets are going to be paying for, you know, all the construction costs of the stadium. As you look at it and break down where they're getting tax breaks and where they're getting sort of hidden subsidies, the taxpayers wind up paying most of the cost. JUAN GONZALEZ : And, Congressman Kucinich, you originally had scheduled your hearing for this week but then decided to postpone it until September. Have you been in conversations with the City of New York and with the Yankees about them also testifying at your hearing? And what documents, specifically, are you trying to get from them now? REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, I could say that my subcommittee staff - and again, I'm the chair of the Domestic Policy Subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over this matter - and our subcommittee staff is in contact with officials of both the City of New York and the New York Yankees to discuss their potential appearance in front of our congressional subcommittee. I think that it's very important to understand that we're looking at a public policy matter here that relates not only to New York and not only to the Nets and the Atlantic Yard project, but it also relates to the whole country, as your other guests have said, because it's quite possible that there are billions of dollars in tax benefits that should be going to municipalities for the purposes of repairing their infrastructure and for schools and other things and that are instead being diverted for these private sports complexes. And the question is one of public policy, one of the IRS , and in the case of the New York Yankees, questions of securities law, because of the various amounts of the appraisal, $45 a square foot versus $275 a square foot, which have a bearing on the overall cost of the project. And if the cost of the project is inflated, that's going to be of interest to the SEC , as well as the IRS . JUAN GONZALEZ : And in terms of the - you're not, at this point, contemplating subpoenaing any records. You're figuring that they are going to be - they will provide you the documents and the information that you requested to avoid that potential. REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, you know, we generally assume that we'll get cooperation. I mean, certainly, as an investigative subcommittee, if we need to enforce that request with a subpoena, we have the ability to apply for that. But we're not at that point yet. And, you know, we're hopeful for cooperation on the part of all the parties involved. And I think that, again, this is a matter of serious public policy. When you have New York City, a great American city, which has all these capital infrastructure needs, and when payments get diverted, essentially - payments are not going into areas where the city expects the tax revenues will be coming from, and instead they're diverted in these payments in lieu of taxes, they're intensely serious matters that need to be discussed. And so, that's why the work that Mr. Brodsky is doing and your other guests are involved in is very significant. We're going to continue with our work on the Domestic Policy Subcommittee, and we'll be sure to keep you posted. JUAN GONZALEZ : OK. We're talking with Congressman Dennis Kucinich in Washington, and here also, Bettina Damiani of Good Jobs New York and Neil deMause, the author of Field of Schemes . We're going to return in a minute and to continue the conversation. And before Congressman Kucinich leaves, we also want to ask him about the hearings in Congress, the potential impeachment hearings. We'll be back in a minute. [break] JUAN GONZALEZ : We're talking about the use of public subsidies for sports stadiums. We're joined from Washington, D.C. by Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich. And here in New York, we have Bettina Damiani, the project director of Good Jobs New York, and Neil deMause, author of Field of Schemes: How the Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money into Private Profit . But, Congressman Kucinich, you've been leading the fight for impeachment, and I know you have to go very soon, so I wanted to ask you about an interview with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that aired on The View earlier this week. She was asked about impeachment. JOY BEHAR : You've ruled against impeaching George Bush and Dick Cheney, and now Kucinich is trying to pass that. Why do you insist on not impeaching these people, so that the world and America can really see the crimes that they've committed? REP . NANCY PELOSI : Well, I think that it - I think it was important, when I became Speaker - and it's, by the way, a very important position - President, Vice President, Speaker of the House - I saw it as my responsibility to try to bring a much divided country together to the extent that we could. I thought that impeachment would be divisive for the country. In terms of what we wanted - set out to do, we wanted to raise the minimum wage, give the biggest increase in veterans benefits to veterans in the seventy-seven-year history, then pass research for stem cell research, all of that. This week, we're going to pass equal pay for equal work. It has been a long time in coming - pay equity. We're going to pass legislations for product safety, for toys that children put in their - there's an agenda that you have to get done. You have to try to do it in a bipartisan way. The President has to sign it. If somebody had a crime that the President had committed, that would be a different story. JOY BEHAR : Can they still do it after he's out? BARBARA WALTERS : When we - when I interviewed you last year, you had just begun, and you were going to clean up the mess, remember? REP . NANCY PELOSI : And we did. BARBARA WALTERS : You look around this country, 75 percent of the country - forget George Bush - thinks that Congress is doing a lousy job. ELISABETH HASSELBECK : I think it's 91 percent now. REP . NANCY PELOSI : Well, I don't disagree with that, because largely it's predicated on ending the war in Iraq. That's the main question, and we were not successful. In our House of Representatives, I'm very proud of our members, because they voted overwhelmingly over and over again to bring the war to an end, bring the troops home safely and soon, sent it to the Senate, and it hits a dead end. But in terms of that particular standard, I would say I disapprove, as well. But we do - we passed some of the things I just mentioned, the energy bill. We worked in a bipartisan way, Innovation Agenda. We have to create jobs, expand healthcare, protect the American people and educate our children. And you can't do that if you're trying to impeach the President at the same time, unless you have the goods that this president committed crimes. JUAN GONZALEZ : That was House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Congressman Kucinich, your response to her take on the situation with impeachment? REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, now that I've heard that the Speaker is looking for evidence that crimes may have been committed, I certainly want to direct her attention to the thirty-five articles of impeachment that I presented, which assert quite directly that crimes have been committed, including taking this nation into a war, an illegal war, based on lies; including the deaths of over a million innocent Iraqis, which constitute a war crime; including wiretapping, rendition, torture, illegal detention. There are many examples of laws that have been broken. And the reason why the Judiciary Committee should hold a hearing on the impeachment itself is because there needs to be a public airing of this. So, I have a great deal of respect for Speaker Pelosi, and I think that since she made that statement on The View , there's an opportunity now for us to come forward and to lay all the facts out so that she can reconsider her decision not to permit the Judiciary Committee to proceed with a full impeachment hearing. I just want to state this, that I appreciate that she consented to a hearing on Friday. It was a six-hour hearing, over a dozen witnesses. Twenty-four members of Congress attended. It's being taken seriously. I think the idea that nothing can be done right now because we're on the eve of an election raises questions about our constitutional responsibility to be a check and balance to administration abuse of power. If in fact we're in a war that's based on lies, and we have thousands of troops whose lives are on the line every day, we owe it to them and we owe it to the American people to set straight the public record. And then, whether or not it results in the President being removed from office before the end of his term is another matter. I want to further say that with the possibility of a war in Iran in the offing, a war against Iran, a war that would be a result of a pre-emptive attack, much like the one that the United States launched against Iraq, it becomes very important that we hold this administration to the highest standard of having to verify the statements they make to take us into one war and to try to take us into another. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, Congressman Dennis Kucinich of Ohio, thank you, once again, for joining us. And we're going to continue the conversation here on the stadium issues with Bettina Damiani of Good Jobs New York and Neil deMause, author of Field of Schemes . I'd like to - again, getting back to the stadium deal, this Yankee Stadium is the most expensive stadium in the history of the United States. The actual cost is very hard to get your hands around, because there are some public infrastructure subsidies. But we're talking about a stadium that is going to be somewhere between one and two billion dollars, when you add up all of the actual costs, probably closer to two. And, Neil, could you talk about this - how the public expenditures are being used, even though we're being told that they're not being - public money is not being used directly for the stadium? NEIL DEMAUSE : Sure. I mean, it's something I've been trying to track ever since this was first announced three years ago. There is, as you mentioned, this infrastructure cost, where the public is paying for building new parks to replace the ones that were torn down to make way for the new stadium, paying for moving a water main and other things like that. JUAN GONZALEZ : And when you say parks that were torn down, because that was, itself, a big issue -- NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah, this -- JUAN GONZALEZ : - this is public park land, about a - what was it? Twenty acres or at least -- NEIL DEMAUSE : It was like twenty-two acres that was actually demolished. It was park that had been there even longer than Yankee Stadium that was demolished to make way for the new stadium. To make up for this, the city and state had to make sure that there was an equal amount of park land that was created. So they're knocking down the old stadium completely. Originally, the team was talking, \"Oh, we're going to save it as a museum.\" It's going to be gone starting next year, and they're going to put some ball fields there. And they've found some space down by the Harlem River where they're going to squeeze in some tennis courts, and sort of little patchwork of parks around different places. The public is paying for all that. The public is paying for the actual demolition of Yankee Stadium, is all going to be public. The public is paying a good chunk for building new parking garages for the Yankees, including one that will be used by the players and VIPs and various folks like that. And the team is getting all sorts of different tax breaks. As Bettina mentioned, they're not going to be paying property taxes. They're going to be getting mortgage-recording taxes. They're going to be getting these tax-exempt bonds that we've been talking about, which is actually a tremendous amount of money, if they get the new $300 million in bonds they're looking for. They're going to be talking about getting more than $300 million worth of tax breaks just on the bonds themselves. So when you add it all up, you get somewhere around $900 million worth of public money that's being spent just on Yankee Stadium. JUAN GONZALEZ : Bettina, those who advocate these stadiums say, \"Why not? This is economic development. It's creating jobs. It's keeping a sort of a -- the psychology of the city by having a professional sports team that the residents can root for.\" What's wrong with it? BETTINA DAMIANI : All the subsidies that Neil just listed. You would like to assume that the city and the state made a clear path to making sure that there were going to be jobs, good-paying jobs for New Yorkers, on the other end. That was going to be the investment, right? We see nothing. There's nothing that says a certain number of jobs has to be set aside for either local New York residents or local Bronx residents, or the number of jobs at all. The city has really washed their hands of making sure there's any accountability on jobs and clear benefits for New Yorkers on the other side of this project, which is very unfortunate. I mean, we're grateful for Congressman Kucinich and Assembly member Brodsky to get involved in this issue. Neither represent New York City, by the way. New York City elected officials - they're filling a void, because local elected officials in New York City have refused to get involved in this project. And we need them. We need them to make sure that the promises in the press releases actually turn out to be something that we can hold them accountable for. JUAN GONZALEZ : And you have, generally speaking, on this issue of tax-exempt financing for economic development, raised numerous questions over the years. It's been one of my favorite topics, how cities are siphoning off their tax bases to create special deals for developers, whether it's sports teams or private companies, where they're, in essence, siphoning off the existing tax base from the municipal government and using it to fund special projects. How rampant is this, not only in New York, but throughout the country? BETTINA DAMIANI : It's a terrible issue regarding not only the issue of financing, but making sure that there are quality jobs for Americans and, in our case, New Yorkers. There's a thing called the economic war among the states, where it seems that so many municipalities and states are worried about fighting one another for the headquarters of a particular agency that they're willing to set aside basic fiscal commonsense and not making sure that there are real quality jobs on the ends of these big deals. Site consultants are prevalent throughout the country that have really manufactured this process, and they make it seem like if the Yankees didn't get their subsidy or if the New York Stock Exchange didn't get a subsidy, they were going to flee somewhere else, without taking into consideration or doing some real due diligence. Where were the Yankees going to go? The Yankees are famous because they're in the Bronx. We have a large media here. We have an incredible fan base here. And it seems none of that was taken in consideration before this huge giveaway was done. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, that's one of the things I think Assembly member Brodsky is trying to investigate, because the city agency that engineered this deal, the Industrial Development Authority, apparently said that the Yankees were threatening to leave New York, of course, the most expensive media market in the country, the most desirable media market in the country. Neil, your sense of whether that was real or not? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah, I mean, and I think everyone knows that the Yankees were not going to move out of New York City, and it's kind of been an open secret for decades now, as long as George Steinbrenner has been demanding a stadium. Where is he going to go? The Yankees are not worth the, whatever, billion dollars that they're worth if they move to Charlotte, North Carolina. But that was the pretense. And the Yankees actually told the judge in a case trying to stop the demolition of the parks, \"Well, if you try and hold up this case, the Yankees could move.\" And, you know, they've been allowed to get away with this. And as Bettina was saying, elected officials never challenged them on this, until, you know, recently Brodsky is trying - been trying to track it down. JUAN GONZALEZ : And, of course, the final irony of all of this is, in the new stadium, once it gets built, as with all these stadiums, the ticket prices for the average baseball fan go through the roof.

And I think what you're going to see is -- JUAN GONZALEZ : For one game? NEIL DEMAUSE : For one game, yes. For one game, yes, absolutely. For a whole season, you know, all bets are off. But I think, you know, what you're going to see the Yankees do, they've promised to keep bleacher tickets low. They've promised to keep a certain number of, you know, $25-or-less seats.

The public is paying for all that. The public is paying for the actual demolition of Yankee Stadium, is all going to be public. The public is paying a good chunk for building new parking garages for the Yankees, including one that will be used by the players and VIPs and various folks like that. And the team is getting all sorts of different tax breaks. As Bettina mentioned, they're not going to be paying property taxes. They're going to be getting mortgage-recording taxes.

It's keeping a sort of a -- the psychology of the city by having a professional sports team that the residents can root for.\" What's wrong with it? BETTINA DAMIANI : All the subsidies that Neil just listed. You would like to assume that the city and the state made a clear path to making sure that there were going to be jobs, good-paying jobs for New Yorkers, on the other end. That was going to be the investment, right? We see nothing. There's nothing that says a certain number of jobs has to be set aside for either local New York residents or local Bronx residents, or the number of jobs at all. The city has really washed their hands of making sure there's any accountability on jobs and clear benefits for New Yorkers on the other side of this project, which is very unfortunate. I mean, we're grateful for Congressman Kucinich and Assembly member Brodsky to get involved in this issue. Neither represent New York City, by the way. New York City elected officials - they're filling a void, because local elected officials in New York City have refused to get involved in this project. And we need them. We need them to make sure that the promises in the press releases actually turn out to be something that we can hold them accountable for. JUAN GONZALEZ : And you have, generally speaking, on this issue of tax-exempt financing for economic development, raised numerous questions over the years. It's been one of my favorite topics, how cities are siphoning off their tax bases to create special deals for developers, whether it's sports teams or private companies, where they're, in essence, siphoning off the existing tax base from the municipal government and using it to fund special projects. How rampant is this, not only in New York, but throughout the country? BETTINA DAMIANI : It's a terrible issue regarding not only the issue of financing, but making sure that there are quality jobs for Americans and, in our case, New Yorkers. There's a thing called the economic war among the states, where it seems that so many municipalities and states are worried about fighting one another for the headquarters of a particular agency that they're willing to set aside basic fiscal commonsense and not making sure that there are real quality jobs on the ends of these big deals. Site consultants are prevalent throughout the country that have really manufactured this process, and they make it seem like if the Yankees didn't get their subsidy or if the New York Stock Exchange didn't get a subsidy, they were going to flee somewhere else, without taking into consideration or doing some real due diligence. Where were the Yankees going to go? The Yankees are famous because they're in the Bronx. We have a large media here. We have an incredible fan base here. And it seems none of that was taken in consideration before this huge giveaway was done. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, that's one of the things I think Assembly member Brodsky is trying to investigate, because the city agency that engineered this deal, the Industrial Development Authority, apparently said that the Yankees were threatening to leave New York, of course, the most expensive media market in the country, the most desirable media market in the country. Neil, your sense of whether that was real or not? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah, I mean, and I think everyone knows that the Yankees were not going to move out of New York City, and it's kind of been an open secret for decades now, as long as George Steinbrenner has been demanding a stadium. Where is he going to go? The Yankees are not worth the, whatever, billion dollars that they're worth if they move to Charlotte, North Carolina. But that was the pretense. And the Yankees actually told the judge in a case trying to stop the demolition of the parks, \"Well, if you try and hold up this case, the Yankees could move.\" And, you know, they've been allowed to get away with this. And as Bettina was saying, elected officials never challenged them on this, until, you know, recently Brodsky is trying - been trying to track it down. JUAN GONZALEZ : And, of course, the final irony of all of this is, in the new stadium, once it gets built, as with all these stadiums, the ticket prices for the average baseball fan go through the roof. The prices in Yankee Stadium for box seats now are astronomical -- they're astronomical now, but what they will cost in the new stadium is unbelievable. Could you talk about some of the prices that they've released so far? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah. I mean, they're talking over, you know, $1,000, $2,000 a seat for some of the really premium seats. And I think what you're going to see is -- JUAN GONZALEZ : For one game? NEIL DEMAUSE : For one game, yes. For one game, yes, absolutely. For a whole season, you know, all bets are off. But I think, you know, what you're going to see the Yankees do, they've promised to keep bleacher tickets low. They've promised to keep a certain number of, you know, $25-or-less seats. I think what you're going to see them do is, especially with Brodsky and everyone else paying attention to the soaring costs, I think you're going to see the Yankees keep ticket prices low for the first season or two and, you know, try to say, \"OK, we're holding the line.\" And then, as everybody's clamoring to get tickets, two, three years down the road, you'll see those start to creep up. So, what I'm worried about isn't, next year, is it going to be affordable, but three years from now, is anybody going to be able to get a ticket? JUAN GONZALEZ : Right. And then, of course, the final irony with - because most of these stadiums have luxury boxes that are for corporations that go from $500,000 to $800,000, in the case of the Yankees, per year to rent these boxes, and of course, my newspaper, the Daily News , reported yesterday that in this deal, the City of New York arranged to have its own luxury box at Yankee Stadium available, presumably to city officials, as part of the deal for the financing. Bettina, your response to that? BETTINA DAMIANI : It's aptly coined the landlord suite. And it's just another example of how local elected officials almost seem to be void of feeling that they have responsibility to the public, because they're going to get nice seats, in the long run. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, I want to thank both of you for being with us, Bettina Damiani, the project director of Good Jobs New York, and Neil deMause, who's a writer and the author of Field of Schemes: How the Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money into Private Profit .\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : And, Congressman Kucinich, you originally had scheduled your hearing for this week but then decided to postpone it until September. Have you been in conversations with the City of New York and with the Yankees about them also testifying at your hearing? And what documents, specifically, are you trying to get from them now? REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, I could say that my subcommittee staff - and again, I'm the chair of the Domestic Policy Subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over this matter - and our subcommittee staff is in contact with officials of both the City of New York and the New York Yankees to discuss their potential appearance in front of our congressional subcommittee. I think that it's very important to understand that we're looking at a public policy matter here that relates not only to New York and not only to the Nets and the Atlantic Yard project, but it also relates to the whole country, as your other guests have said, because it's quite possible that there are billions of dollars in tax benefits that should be going to municipalities for the purposes of repairing their infrastructure and for schools and other things and that are instead being diverted for these private sports complexes. And the question is one of public policy, one of the IRS , and in the case of the New York Yankees, questions of securities law, because of the various amounts of the appraisal, $45 a square foot versus $275 a square foot, which have a bearing on the overall cost of the project. And if the cost of the project is inflated, that's going to be of interest to the SEC , as well as the IRS . JUAN GONZALEZ : And in terms of the - you're not, at this point, contemplating subpoenaing any records. You're figuring that they are going to be - they will provide you the documents and the information that you requested to avoid that potential. REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, you know, we generally assume that we'll get cooperation. I mean, certainly, as an investigative subcommittee, if we need to enforce that request with a subpoena, we have the ability to apply for that. But we're not at that point yet. And, you know, we're hopeful for cooperation on the part of all the parties involved. And I think that, again, this is a matter of serious public policy. When you have New York City, a great American city, which has all these capital infrastructure needs, and when payments get diverted, essentially - payments are not going into areas where the city expects the tax revenues will be coming from, and instead they're diverted in these payments in lieu of taxes, they're intensely serious matters that need to be discussed. And so, that's why the work that Mr. Brodsky is doing and your other guests are involved in is very significant. We're going to continue with our work on the Domestic Policy Subcommittee, and we'll be sure to keep you posted. JUAN GONZALEZ : OK. We're talking with Congressman Dennis Kucinich in Washington, and here also, Bettina Damiani of Good Jobs New York and Neil deMause, the author of Field of Schemes . We're going to return in a minute and to continue the conversation. And before Congressman Kucinich leaves, we also want to ask him about the hearings in Congress, the potential impeachment hearings. We'll be back in a minute. [break] JUAN GONZALEZ : We're talking about the use of public subsidies for sports stadiums. We're joined from Washington, D.C. by Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich. And here in New York, we have Bettina Damiani, the project director of Good Jobs New York, and Neil deMause, author of Field of Schemes: How the Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money into Private Profit . But, Congressman Kucinich, you've been leading the fight for impeachment, and I know you have to go very soon, so I wanted to ask you about an interview with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that aired on The View earlier this week. She was asked about impeachment. JOY BEHAR : You've ruled against impeaching George Bush and Dick Cheney, and now Kucinich is trying to pass that. Why do you insist on not impeaching these people, so that the world and America can really see the crimes that they've committed? REP . NANCY PELOSI : Well, I think that it - I think it was important, when I became Speaker - and it's, by the way, a very important position - President, Vice President, Speaker of the House - I saw it as my responsibility to try to bring a much divided country together to the extent that we could. I thought that impeachment would be divisive for the country. In terms of what we wanted - set out to do, we wanted to raise the minimum wage, give the biggest increase in veterans benefits to veterans in the seventy-seven-year history, then pass research for stem cell research, all of that. This week, we're going to pass equal pay for equal work. It has been a long time in coming - pay equity. We're going to pass legislations for product safety, for toys that children put in their - there's an agenda that you have to get done. You have to try to do it in a bipartisan way. The President has to sign it. If somebody had a crime that the President had committed, that would be a different story. JOY BEHAR : Can they still do it after he's out? BARBARA WALTERS : When we - when I interviewed you last year, you had just begun, and you were going to clean up the mess, remember? REP . NANCY PELOSI : And we did. BARBARA WALTERS : You look around this country, 75 percent of the country - forget George Bush - thinks that Congress is doing a lousy job. ELISABETH HASSELBECK : I think it's 91 percent now. REP . NANCY PELOSI : Well, I don't disagree with that, because largely it's predicated on ending the war in Iraq. That's the main question, and we were not successful. In our House of Representatives, I'm very proud of our members, because they voted overwhelmingly over and over again to bring the war to an end, bring the troops home safely and soon, sent it to the Senate, and it hits a dead end. But in terms of that particular standard, I would say I disapprove, as well. But we do - we passed some of the things I just mentioned, the energy bill. We worked in a bipartisan way, Innovation Agenda. We have to create jobs, expand healthcare, protect the American people and educate our children. And you can't do that if you're trying to impeach the President at the same time, unless you have the goods that this president committed crimes. JUAN GONZALEZ : That was House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Congressman Kucinich, your response to her take on the situation with impeachment? REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, now that I've heard that the Speaker is looking for evidence that crimes may have been committed, I certainly want to direct her attention to the thirty-five articles of impeachment that I presented, which assert quite directly that crimes have been committed, including taking this nation into a war, an illegal war, based on lies; including the deaths of over a million innocent Iraqis, which constitute a war crime; including wiretapping, rendition, torture, illegal detention. There are many examples of laws that have been broken. And the reason why the Judiciary Committee should hold a hearing on the impeachment itself is because there needs to be a public airing of this. So, I have a great deal of respect for Speaker Pelosi, and I think that since she made that statement on The View , there's an opportunity now for us to come forward and to lay all the facts out so that she can reconsider her decision not to permit the Judiciary Committee to proceed with a full impeachment hearing. I just want to state this, that I appreciate that she consented to a hearing on Friday. It was a six-hour hearing, over a dozen witnesses. Twenty-four members of Congress attended. It's being taken seriously. I think the idea that nothing can be done right now because we're on the eve of an election raises questions about our constitutional responsibility to be a check and balance to administration abuse of power. If in fact we're in a war that's based on lies, and we have thousands of troops whose lives are on the line every day, we owe it to them and we owe it to the American people to set straight the public record. And then, whether or not it results in the President being removed from office before the end of his term is another matter. I want to further say that with the possibility of a war in Iran in the offing, a war against Iran, a war that would be a result of a pre-emptive attack, much like the one that the United States launched against Iraq, it becomes very important that we hold this administration to the highest standard of having to verify the statements they make to take us into one war and to try to take us into another. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, Congressman Dennis Kucinich of Ohio, thank you, once again, for joining us. And we're going to continue the conversation here on the stadium issues with Bettina Damiani of Good Jobs New York and Neil deMause, author of Field of Schemes . I'd like to - again, getting back to the stadium deal, this Yankee Stadium is the most expensive stadium in the history of the United States. The actual cost is very hard to get your hands around, because there are some public infrastructure subsidies. But we're talking about a stadium that is going to be somewhere between one and two billion dollars, when you add up all of the actual costs, probably closer to two. And, Neil, could you talk about this - how the public expenditures are being used, even though we're being told that they're not being - public money is not being used directly for the stadium? NEIL DEMAUSE : Sure. I mean, it's something I've been trying to track ever since this was first announced three years ago. There is, as you mentioned, this infrastructure cost, where the public is paying for building new parks to replace the ones that were torn down to make way for the new stadium, paying for moving a water main and other things like that. JUAN GONZALEZ : And when you say parks that were torn down, because that was, itself, a big issue -- NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah, this -- JUAN GONZALEZ : - this is public park land, about a - what was it? Twenty acres or at least -- NEIL DEMAUSE : It was like twenty-two acres that was actually demolished. It was park that had been there even longer than Yankee Stadium that was demolished to make way for the new stadium. To make up for this, the city and state had to make sure that there was an equal amount of park land that was created. So they're knocking down the old stadium completely. Originally, the team was talking, \"Oh, we're going to save it as a museum.\" It's going to be gone starting next year, and they're going to put some ball fields there. And they've found some space down by the Harlem River where they're going to squeeze in some tennis courts, and sort of little patchwork of parks around different places. The public is paying for all that. The public is paying for the actual demolition of Yankee Stadium, is all going to be public. The public is paying a good chunk for building new parking garages for the Yankees, including one that will be used by the players and VIPs and various folks like that. And the team is getting all sorts of different tax breaks. As Bettina mentioned, they're not going to be paying property taxes. They're going to be getting mortgage-recording taxes. They're going to be getting these tax-exempt bonds that we've been talking about, which is actually a tremendous amount of money, if they get the new $300 million in bonds they're looking for. They're going to be talking about getting more than $300 million worth of tax breaks just on the bonds themselves. So when you add it all up, you get somewhere around $900 million worth of public money that's being spent just on Yankee Stadium. JUAN GONZALEZ : Bettina, those who advocate these stadiums say, \"Why not? This is economic development. It's creating jobs. It's keeping a sort of a -- the psychology of the city by having a professional sports team that the residents can root for.\" What's wrong with it? BETTINA DAMIANI : All the subsidies that Neil just listed. You would like to assume that the city and the state made a clear path to making sure that there were going to be jobs, good-paying jobs for New Yorkers, on the other end. That was going to be the investment, right? We see nothing. There's nothing that says a certain number of jobs has to be set aside for either local New York residents or local Bronx residents, or the number of jobs at all. The city has really washed their hands of making sure there's any accountability on jobs and clear benefits for New Yorkers on the other side of this project, which is very unfortunate. I mean, we're grateful for Congressman Kucinich and Assembly member Brodsky to get involved in this issue. Neither represent New York City, by the way. New York City elected officials - they're filling a void, because local elected officials in New York City have refused to get involved in this project. And we need them. We need them to make sure that the promises in the press releases actually turn out to be something that we can hold them accountable for. JUAN GONZALEZ : And you have, generally speaking, on this issue of tax-exempt financing for economic development, raised numerous questions over the years.

There's a thing called the economic war among the states, where it seems that so many municipalities and states are worried about fighting one another for the headquarters of a particular agency that they're willing to set aside basic fiscal commonsense and not making sure that there are real quality jobs on the ends of these big deals. Site consultants are prevalent throughout the country that have really manufactured this process, and they make it seem like if the Yankees didn't get their subsidy or if the New York Stock Exchange didn't get a subsidy, they were going to flee somewhere else, without taking into consideration or doing some real due diligence.

NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah, I mean, and I think everyone knows that the Yankees were not going to move out of New York City, and it's kind of been an open secret for decades now, as long as George Steinbrenner has been demanding a stadium.

JUAN GONZALEZ : And when you say parks that were torn down, because that was, itself, a big issue -- NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah, this -- JUAN GONZALEZ : - this is public park land, about a - what was it? Twenty acres or at least -- NEIL DEMAUSE : It was like twenty-two acres that was actually demolished. It was park that had been there even longer than Yankee Stadium that was demolished to make way for the new stadium. To make up for this, the city and state had to make sure that there was an equal amount of park land that was created. So they're knocking down the old stadium completely. Originally, the team was talking, \"Oh, we're going to save it as a museum.\" It's going to be gone starting next year, and they're going to put some ball fields there. And they've found some space down by the Harlem River where they're going to squeeze in some tennis courts, and sort of little patchwork of parks around different places. The public is paying for all that. The public is paying for the actual demolition of Yankee Stadium, is all going to be public. The public is paying a good chunk for building new parking garages for the Yankees, including one that will be used by the players and VIPs and various folks like that. And the team is getting all sorts of different tax breaks. As Bettina mentioned, they're not going to be paying property taxes. They're going to be getting mortgage-recording taxes. They're going to be getting these tax-exempt bonds that we've been talking about, which is actually a tremendous amount of money, if they get the new $300 million in bonds they're looking for. They're going to be talking about getting more than $300 million worth of tax breaks just on the bonds themselves. So when you add it all up, you get somewhere around $900 million worth of public money that's being spent just on Yankee Stadium. JUAN GONZALEZ : Bettina, those who advocate these stadiums say, \"Why not? This is economic development. It's creating jobs. It's keeping a sort of a -- the psychology of the city by having a professional sports team that the residents can root for.\" What's wrong with it? BETTINA DAMIANI : All the subsidies that Neil just listed. You would like to assume that the city and the state made a clear path to making sure that there were going to be jobs, good-paying jobs for New Yorkers, on the other end. That was going to be the investment, right? We see nothing. There's nothing that says a certain number of jobs has to be set aside for either local New York residents or local Bronx residents, or the number of jobs at all. The city has really washed their hands of making sure there's any accountability on jobs and clear benefits for New Yorkers on the other side of this project, which is very unfortunate. I mean, we're grateful for Congressman Kucinich and Assembly member Brodsky to get involved in this issue. Neither represent New York City, by the way. New York City elected officials - they're filling a void, because local elected officials in New York City have refused to get involved in this project. And we need them. We need them to make sure that the promises in the press releases actually turn out to be something that we can hold them accountable for. JUAN GONZALEZ : And you have, generally speaking, on this issue of tax-exempt financing for economic development, raised numerous questions over the years. It's been one of my favorite topics, how cities are siphoning off their tax bases to create special deals for developers, whether it's sports teams or private companies, where they're, in essence, siphoning off the existing tax base from the municipal government and using it to fund special projects. How rampant is this, not only in New York, but throughout the country? BETTINA DAMIANI : It's a terrible issue regarding not only the issue of financing, but making sure that there are quality jobs for Americans and, in our case, New Yorkers. There's a thing called the economic war among the states, where it seems that so many municipalities and states are worried about fighting one another for the headquarters of a particular agency that they're willing to set aside basic fiscal commonsense and not making sure that there are real quality jobs on the ends of these big deals. Site consultants are prevalent throughout the country that have really manufactured this process, and they make it seem like if the Yankees didn't get their subsidy or if the New York Stock Exchange didn't get a subsidy, they were going to flee somewhere else, without taking into consideration or doing some real due diligence. Where were the Yankees going to go? The Yankees are famous because they're in the Bronx. We have a large media here. We have an incredible fan base here. And it seems none of that was taken in consideration before this huge giveaway was done. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, that's one of the things I think Assembly member Brodsky is trying to investigate, because the city agency that engineered this deal, the Industrial Development Authority, apparently said that the Yankees were threatening to leave New York, of course, the most expensive media market in the country, the most desirable media market in the country. Neil, your sense of whether that was real or not? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah, I mean, and I think everyone knows that the Yankees were not going to move out of New York City, and it's kind of been an open secret for decades now, as long as George Steinbrenner has been demanding a stadium. Where is he going to go? The Yankees are not worth the, whatever, billion dollars that they're worth if they move to Charlotte, North Carolina. But that was the pretense. And the Yankees actually told the judge in a case trying to stop the demolition of the parks, \"Well, if you try and hold up this case, the Yankees could move.\" And, you know, they've been allowed to get away with this. And as Bettina was saying, elected officials never challenged them on this, until, you know, recently Brodsky is trying - been trying to track it down. JUAN GONZALEZ : And, of course, the final irony of all of this is, in the new stadium, once it gets built, as with all these stadiums, the ticket prices for the average baseball fan go through the roof. The prices in Yankee Stadium for box seats now are astronomical -- they're astronomical now, but what they will cost in the new stadium is unbelievable. Could you talk about some of the prices that they've released so far? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah. I mean, they're talking over, you know, $1,000, $2,000 a seat for some of the really premium seats. And I think what you're going to see is -- JUAN GONZALEZ : For one game? NEIL DEMAUSE : For one game, yes. For one game, yes, absolutely. For a whole season, you know, all bets are off. But I think, you know, what you're going to see the Yankees do, they've promised to keep bleacher tickets low. They've promised to keep a certain number of, you know, $25-or-less seats. I think what you're going to see them do is, especially with Brodsky and everyone else paying attention to the soaring costs, I think you're going to see the Yankees keep ticket prices low for the first season or two and, you know, try to say, \"OK, we're holding the line.\" And then, as everybody's clamoring to get tickets, two, three years down the road, you'll see those start to creep up. So, what I'm worried about isn't, next year, is it going to be affordable, but three years from now, is anybody going to be able to get a ticket? JUAN GONZALEZ : Right. And then, of course, the final irony with - because most of these stadiums have luxury boxes that are for corporations that go from $500,000 to $800,000, in the case of the Yankees, per year to rent these boxes, and of course, my newspaper, the Daily News , reported yesterday that in this deal, the City of New York arranged to have its own luxury box at Yankee Stadium available, presumably to city officials, as part of the deal for the financing. Bettina, your response to that? BETTINA DAMIANI : It's aptly coined the landlord suite. And it's just another example of how local elected officials almost seem to be void of feeling that they have responsibility to the public, because they're going to get nice seats, in the long run. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, I want to thank both of you for being with us, Bettina Damiani, the project director of Good Jobs New York, and Neil deMause, who's a writer and the author of Field of Schemes: How the Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money into Private Profit .\n\nI think that it's very important to understand that we're looking at a public policy matter here that relates not only to New York and not only to the Nets and the Atlantic Yard project, but it also relates to the whole country, as your other guests have said, because it's quite possible that there are billions of dollars in tax benefits that should be going to municipalities for the purposes of repairing their infrastructure and for schools and other things and that are instead being diverted for these private sports complexes. And the question is one of public policy, one of the IRS , and in the case of the New York Yankees, questions of securities law, because of the various amounts of the appraisal, $45 a square foot versus $275 a square foot, which have a bearing on the overall cost of the project. And if the cost of the project is inflated, that's going to be of interest to the SEC , as well as the IRS . JUAN GONZALEZ : And in terms of the - you're not, at this point, contemplating subpoenaing any records. You're figuring that they are going to be - they will provide you the documents and the information that you requested to avoid that potential. REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, you know, we generally assume that we'll get cooperation. I mean, certainly, as an investigative subcommittee, if we need to enforce that request with a subpoena, we have the ability to apply for that. But we're not at that point yet. And, you know, we're hopeful for cooperation on the part of all the parties involved. And I think that, again, this is a matter of serious public policy. When you have New York City, a great American city, which has all these capital infrastructure needs, and when payments get diverted, essentially - payments are not going into areas where the city expects the tax revenues will be coming from, and instead they're diverted in these payments in lieu of taxes, they're intensely serious matters that need to be discussed. And so, that's why the work that Mr. Brodsky is doing and your other guests are involved in is very significant. We're going to continue with our work on the Domestic Policy Subcommittee, and we'll be sure to keep you posted. JUAN GONZALEZ : OK. We're talking with Congressman Dennis Kucinich in Washington, and here also, Bettina Damiani of Good Jobs New York and Neil deMause, the author of Field of Schemes . We're going to return in a minute and to continue the conversation. And before Congressman Kucinich leaves, we also want to ask him about the hearings in Congress, the potential impeachment hearings. We'll be back in a minute. [break] JUAN GONZALEZ : We're talking about the use of public subsidies for sports stadiums. We're joined from Washington, D.C. by Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich. And here in New York, we have Bettina Damiani, the project director of Good Jobs New York, and Neil deMause, author of Field of Schemes: How the Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money into Private Profit . But, Congressman Kucinich, you've been leading the fight for impeachment, and I know you have to go very soon, so I wanted to ask you about an interview with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that aired on The View earlier this week. She was asked about impeachment. JOY BEHAR : You've ruled against impeaching George Bush and Dick Cheney, and now Kucinich is trying to pass that. Why do you insist on not impeaching these people, so that the world and America can really see the crimes that they've committed? REP . NANCY PELOSI : Well, I think that it - I think it was important, when I became Speaker - and it's, by the way, a very important position - President, Vice President, Speaker of the House - I saw it as my responsibility to try to bring a much divided country together to the extent that we could. I thought that impeachment would be divisive for the country. In terms of what we wanted - set out to do, we wanted to raise the minimum wage, give the biggest increase in veterans benefits to veterans in the seventy-seven-year history, then pass research for stem cell research, all of that. This week, we're going to pass equal pay for equal work. It has been a long time in coming - pay equity. We're going to pass legislations for product safety, for toys that children put in their - there's an agenda that you have to get done. You have to try to do it in a bipartisan way. The President has to sign it. If somebody had a crime that the President had committed, that would be a different story. JOY BEHAR : Can they still do it after he's out? BARBARA WALTERS : When we - when I interviewed you last year, you had just begun, and you were going to clean up the mess, remember? REP . NANCY PELOSI : And we did. BARBARA WALTERS : You look around this country, 75 percent of the country - forget George Bush - thinks that Congress is doing a lousy job. ELISABETH HASSELBECK : I think it's 91 percent now. REP . NANCY PELOSI : Well, I don't disagree with that, because largely it's predicated on ending the war in Iraq. That's the main question, and we were not successful. In our House of Representatives, I'm very proud of our members, because they voted overwhelmingly over and over again to bring the war to an end, bring the troops home safely and soon, sent it to the Senate, and it hits a dead end. But in terms of that particular standard, I would say I disapprove, as well. But we do - we passed some of the things I just mentioned, the energy bill. We worked in a bipartisan way, Innovation Agenda. We have to create jobs, expand healthcare, protect the American people and educate our children. And you can't do that if you're trying to impeach the President at the same time, unless you have the goods that this president committed crimes. JUAN GONZALEZ : That was House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Congressman Kucinich, your response to her take on the situation with impeachment? REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, now that I've heard that the Speaker is looking for evidence that crimes may have been committed, I certainly want to direct her attention to the thirty-five articles of impeachment that I presented, which assert quite directly that crimes have been committed, including taking this nation into a war, an illegal war, based on lies; including the deaths of over a million innocent Iraqis, which constitute a war crime; including wiretapping, rendition, torture, illegal detention. There are many examples of laws that have been broken. And the reason why the Judiciary Committee should hold a hearing on the impeachment itself is because there needs to be a public airing of this. So, I have a great deal of respect for Speaker Pelosi, and I think that since she made that statement on The View , there's an opportunity now for us to come forward and to lay all the facts out so that she can reconsider her decision not to permit the Judiciary Committee to proceed with a full impeachment hearing. I just want to state this, that I appreciate that she consented to a hearing on Friday. It was a six-hour hearing, over a dozen witnesses. Twenty-four members of Congress attended. It's being taken seriously. I think the idea that nothing can be done right now because we're on the eve of an election raises questions about our constitutional responsibility to be a check and balance to administration abuse of power. If in fact we're in a war that's based on lies, and we have thousands of troops whose lives are on the line every day, we owe it to them and we owe it to the American people to set straight the public record. And then, whether or not it results in the President being removed from office before the end of his term is another matter. I want to further say that with the possibility of a war in Iran in the offing, a war against Iran, a war that would be a result of a pre-emptive attack, much like the one that the United States launched against Iraq, it becomes very important that we hold this administration to the highest standard of having to verify the statements they make to take us into one war and to try to take us into another. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, Congressman Dennis Kucinich of Ohio, thank you, once again, for joining us. And we're going to continue the conversation here on the stadium issues with Bettina Damiani of Good Jobs New York and Neil deMause, author of Field of Schemes . I'd like to - again, getting back to the stadium deal, this Yankee Stadium is the most expensive stadium in the history of the United States. The actual cost is very hard to get your hands around, because there are some public infrastructure subsidies. But we're talking about a stadium that is going to be somewhere between one and two billion dollars, when you add up all of the actual costs, probably closer to two. And, Neil, could you talk about this - how the public expenditures are being used, even though we're being told that they're not being - public money is not being used directly for the stadium? NEIL DEMAUSE : Sure. I mean, it's something I've been trying to track ever since this was first announced three years ago. There is, as you mentioned, this infrastructure cost, where the public is paying for building new parks to replace the ones that were torn down to make way for the new stadium, paying for moving a water main and other things like that.

The public is paying for all that. The public is paying for the actual demolition of Yankee Stadium, is all going to be public. The public is paying a good chunk for building new parking garages for the Yankees, including one that will be used by the players and VIPs and various folks like that.

But we're talking about a stadium that is going to be somewhere between one and two billion dollars, when you add up all of the actual costs, probably closer to two. And, Neil, could you talk about this - how the public expenditures are being used, even though we're being told that they're not being - public money is not being used directly for the stadium? NEIL DEMAUSE : Sure. I mean, it's something I've been trying to track ever since this was first announced three years ago. There is, as you mentioned, this infrastructure cost, where the public is paying for building new parks to replace the ones that were torn down to make way for the new stadium, paying for moving a water main and other things like that. JUAN GONZALEZ : And when you say parks that were torn down, because that was, itself, a big issue -- NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah, this -- JUAN GONZALEZ : - this is public park land, about a - what was it? Twenty acres or at least -- NEIL DEMAUSE : It was like twenty-two acres that was actually demolished. It was park that had been there even longer than Yankee Stadium that was demolished to make way for the new stadium. To make up for this, the city and state had to make sure that there was an equal amount of park land that was created. So they're knocking down the old stadium completely. Originally, the team was talking, \"Oh, we're going to save it as a museum.\" It's going to be gone starting next year, and they're going to put some ball fields there. And they've found some space down by the Harlem River where they're going to squeeze in some tennis courts, and sort of little patchwork of parks around different places. The public is paying for all that. The public is paying for the actual demolition of Yankee Stadium, is all going to be public. The public is paying a good chunk for building new parking garages for the Yankees, including one that will be used by the players and VIPs and various folks like that. And the team is getting all sorts of different tax breaks. As Bettina mentioned, they're not going to be paying property taxes. They're going to be getting mortgage-recording taxes. They're going to be getting these tax-exempt bonds that we've been talking about, which is actually a tremendous amount of money, if they get the new $300 million in bonds they're looking for. They're going to be talking about getting more than $300 million worth of tax breaks just on the bonds themselves. So when you add it all up, you get somewhere around $900 million worth of public money that's being spent just on Yankee Stadium. JUAN GONZALEZ : Bettina, those who advocate these stadiums say, \"Why not? This is economic development. It's creating jobs. It's keeping a sort of a -- the psychology of the city by having a professional sports team that the residents can root for.\" What's wrong with it? BETTINA DAMIANI : All the subsidies that Neil just listed. You would like to assume that the city and the state made a clear path to making sure that there were going to be jobs, good-paying jobs for New Yorkers, on the other end. That was going to be the investment, right? We see nothing. There's nothing that says a certain number of jobs has to be set aside for either local New York residents or local Bronx residents, or the number of jobs at all. The city has really washed their hands of making sure there's any accountability on jobs and clear benefits for New Yorkers on the other side of this project, which is very unfortunate. I mean, we're grateful for Congressman Kucinich and Assembly member Brodsky to get involved in this issue. Neither represent New York City, by the way. New York City elected officials - they're filling a void, because local elected officials in New York City have refused to get involved in this project. And we need them. We need them to make sure that the promises in the press releases actually turn out to be something that we can hold them accountable for. JUAN GONZALEZ : And you have, generally speaking, on this issue of tax-exempt financing for economic development, raised numerous questions over the years. It's been one of my favorite topics, how cities are siphoning off their tax bases to create special deals for developers, whether it's sports teams or private companies, where they're, in essence, siphoning off the existing tax base from the municipal government and using it to fund special projects. How rampant is this, not only in New York, but throughout the country? BETTINA DAMIANI : It's a terrible issue regarding not only the issue of financing, but making sure that there are quality jobs for Americans and, in our case, New Yorkers. There's a thing called the economic war among the states, where it seems that so many municipalities and states are worried about fighting one another for the headquarters of a particular agency that they're willing to set aside basic fiscal commonsense and not making sure that there are real quality jobs on the ends of these big deals. Site consultants are prevalent throughout the country that have really manufactured this process, and they make it seem like if the Yankees didn't get their subsidy or if the New York Stock Exchange didn't get a subsidy, they were going to flee somewhere else, without taking into consideration or doing some real due diligence. Where were the Yankees going to go? The Yankees are famous because they're in the Bronx. We have a large media here. We have an incredible fan base here. And it seems none of that was taken in consideration before this huge giveaway was done. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, that's one of the things I think Assembly member Brodsky is trying to investigate, because the city agency that engineered this deal, the Industrial Development Authority, apparently said that the Yankees were threatening to leave New York, of course, the most expensive media market in the country, the most desirable media market in the country. Neil, your sense of whether that was real or not? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah, I mean, and I think everyone knows that the Yankees were not going to move out of New York City, and it's kind of been an open secret for decades now, as long as George Steinbrenner has been demanding a stadium. Where is he going to go? The Yankees are not worth the, whatever, billion dollars that they're worth if they move to Charlotte, North Carolina. But that was the pretense. And the Yankees actually told the judge in a case trying to stop the demolition of the parks, \"Well, if you try and hold up this case, the Yankees could move.\" And, you know, they've been allowed to get away with this. And as Bettina was saying, elected officials never challenged them on this, until, you know, recently Brodsky is trying - been trying to track it down. JUAN GONZALEZ : And, of course, the final irony of all of this is, in the new stadium, once it gets built, as with all these stadiums, the ticket prices for the average baseball fan go through the roof. The prices in Yankee Stadium for box seats now are astronomical -- they're astronomical now, but what they will cost in the new stadium is unbelievable. Could you talk about some of the prices that they've released so far? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah. I mean, they're talking over, you know, $1,000, $2,000 a seat for some of the really premium seats. And I think what you're going to see is -- JUAN GONZALEZ : For one game? NEIL DEMAUSE : For one game, yes. For one game, yes, absolutely. For a whole season, you know, all bets are off. But I think, you know, what you're going to see the Yankees do, they've promised to keep bleacher tickets low. They've promised to keep a certain number of, you know, $25-or-less seats. I think what you're going to see them do is, especially with Brodsky and everyone else paying attention to the soaring costs, I think you're going to see the Yankees keep ticket prices low for the first season or two and, you know, try to say, \"OK, we're holding the line.\" And then, as everybody's clamoring to get tickets, two, three years down the road, you'll see those start to creep up. So, what I'm worried about isn't, next year, is it going to be affordable, but three years from now, is anybody going to be able to get a ticket? JUAN GONZALEZ : Right. And then, of course, the final irony with - because most of these stadiums have luxury boxes that are for corporations that go from $500,000 to $800,000, in the case of the Yankees, per year to rent these boxes, and of course, my newspaper, the Daily News , reported yesterday that in this deal, the City of New York arranged to have its own luxury box at Yankee Stadium available, presumably to city officials, as part of the deal for the financing. Bettina, your response to that? BETTINA DAMIANI : It's aptly coined the landlord suite. And it's just another example of how local elected officials almost seem to be void of feeling that they have responsibility to the public, because they're going to get nice seats, in the long run. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, I want to thank both of you for being with us, Bettina Damiani, the project director of Good Jobs New York, and Neil deMause, who's a writer and the author of Field of Schemes: How the Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money into Private Profit .\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : And in terms of the - you're not, at this point, contemplating subpoenaing any records. You're figuring that they are going to be - they will provide you the documents and the information that you requested to avoid that potential. REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, you know, we generally assume that we'll get cooperation. I mean, certainly, as an investigative subcommittee, if we need to enforce that request with a subpoena, we have the ability to apply for that. But we're not at that point yet. And, you know, we're hopeful for cooperation on the part of all the parties involved. And I think that, again, this is a matter of serious public policy. When you have New York City, a great American city, which has all these capital infrastructure needs, and when payments get diverted, essentially - payments are not going into areas where the city expects the tax revenues will be coming from, and instead they're diverted in these payments in lieu of taxes, they're intensely serious matters that need to be discussed. And so, that's why the work that Mr. Brodsky is doing and your other guests are involved in is very significant. We're going to continue with our work on the Domestic Policy Subcommittee, and we'll be sure to keep you posted. JUAN GONZALEZ : OK. We're talking with Congressman Dennis Kucinich in Washington, and here also, Bettina Damiani of Good Jobs New York and Neil deMause, the author of Field of Schemes . We're going to return in a minute and to continue the conversation. And before Congressman Kucinich leaves, we also want to ask him about the hearings in Congress, the potential impeachment hearings. We'll be back in a minute. [break] JUAN GONZALEZ : We're talking about the use of public subsidies for sports stadiums. We're joined from Washington, D.C. by Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich. And here in New York, we have Bettina Damiani, the project director of Good Jobs New York, and Neil deMause, author of Field of Schemes: How the Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money into Private Profit . But, Congressman Kucinich, you've been leading the fight for impeachment, and I know you have to go very soon, so I wanted to ask you about an interview with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that aired on The View earlier this week. She was asked about impeachment. JOY BEHAR : You've ruled against impeaching George Bush and Dick Cheney, and now Kucinich is trying to pass that. Why do you insist on not impeaching these people, so that the world and America can really see the crimes that they've committed? REP . NANCY PELOSI : Well, I think that it - I think it was important, when I became Speaker - and it's, by the way, a very important position - President, Vice President, Speaker of the House - I saw it as my responsibility to try to bring a much divided country together to the extent that we could. I thought that impeachment would be divisive for the country. In terms of what we wanted - set out to do, we wanted to raise the minimum wage, give the biggest increase in veterans benefits to veterans in the seventy-seven-year history, then pass research for stem cell research, all of that. This week, we're going to pass equal pay for equal work. It has been a long time in coming - pay equity. We're going to pass legislations for product safety, for toys that children put in their - there's an agenda that you have to get done. You have to try to do it in a bipartisan way. The President has to sign it. If somebody had a crime that the President had committed, that would be a different story. JOY BEHAR : Can they still do it after he's out? BARBARA WALTERS : When we - when I interviewed you last year, you had just begun, and you were going to clean up the mess, remember? REP . NANCY PELOSI : And we did. BARBARA WALTERS : You look around this country, 75 percent of the country - forget George Bush - thinks that Congress is doing a lousy job. ELISABETH HASSELBECK : I think it's 91 percent now. REP . NANCY PELOSI : Well, I don't disagree with that, because largely it's predicated on ending the war in Iraq. That's the main question, and we were not successful. In our House of Representatives, I'm very proud of our members, because they voted overwhelmingly over and over again to bring the war to an end, bring the troops home safely and soon, sent it to the Senate, and it hits a dead end. But in terms of that particular standard, I would say I disapprove, as well. But we do - we passed some of the things I just mentioned, the energy bill. We worked in a bipartisan way, Innovation Agenda. We have to create jobs, expand healthcare, protect the American people and educate our children. And you can't do that if you're trying to impeach the President at the same time, unless you have the goods that this president committed crimes. JUAN GONZALEZ : That was House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Congressman Kucinich, your response to her take on the situation with impeachment? REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, now that I've heard that the Speaker is looking for evidence that crimes may have been committed, I certainly want to direct her attention to the thirty-five articles of impeachment that I presented, which assert quite directly that crimes have been committed, including taking this nation into a war, an illegal war, based on lies; including the deaths of over a million innocent Iraqis, which constitute a war crime; including wiretapping, rendition, torture, illegal detention. There are many examples of laws that have been broken. And the reason why the Judiciary Committee should hold a hearing on the impeachment itself is because there needs to be a public airing of this. So, I have a great deal of respect for Speaker Pelosi, and I think that since she made that statement on The View , there's an opportunity now for us to come forward and to lay all the facts out so that she can reconsider her decision not to permit the Judiciary Committee to proceed with a full impeachment hearing. I just want to state this, that I appreciate that she consented to a hearing on Friday. It was a six-hour hearing, over a dozen witnesses. Twenty-four members of Congress attended. It's being taken seriously. I think the idea that nothing can be done right now because we're on the eve of an election raises questions about our constitutional responsibility to be a check and balance to administration abuse of power. If in fact we're in a war that's based on lies, and we have thousands of troops whose lives are on the line every day, we owe it to them and we owe it to the American people to set straight the public record. And then, whether or not it results in the President being removed from office before the end of his term is another matter. I want to further say that with the possibility of a war in Iran in the offing, a war against Iran, a war that would be a result of a pre-emptive attack, much like the one that the United States launched against Iraq, it becomes very important that we hold this administration to the highest standard of having to verify the statements they make to take us into one war and to try to take us into another. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, Congressman Dennis Kucinich of Ohio, thank you, once again, for joining us. And we're going to continue the conversation here on the stadium issues with Bettina Damiani of Good Jobs New York and Neil deMause, author of Field of Schemes .

It was park that had been there even longer than Yankee Stadium that was demolished to make way for the new stadium. To make up for this, the city and state had to make sure that there was an equal amount of park land that was created. So they're knocking down the old stadium completely. Originally, the team was talking, \"Oh, we're going to save it as a museum.\" It's going to be gone starting next year, and they're going to put some ball fields there. And they've found some space down by the Harlem River where they're going to squeeze in some tennis courts, and sort of little patchwork of parks around different places. The public is paying for all that. The public is paying for the actual demolition of Yankee Stadium, is all going to be public. The public is paying a good chunk for building new parking garages for the Yankees, including one that will be used by the players and VIPs and various folks like that. And the team is getting all sorts of different tax breaks. As Bettina mentioned, they're not going to be paying property taxes. They're going to be getting mortgage-recording taxes. They're going to be getting these tax-exempt bonds that we've been talking about, which is actually a tremendous amount of money, if they get the new $300 million in bonds they're looking for. They're going to be talking about getting more than $300 million worth of tax breaks just on the bonds themselves. So when you add it all up, you get somewhere around $900 million worth of public money that's being spent just on Yankee Stadium. JUAN GONZALEZ : Bettina, those who advocate these stadiums say, \"Why not? This is economic development. It's creating jobs. It's keeping a sort of a -- the psychology of the city by having a professional sports team that the residents can root for.\" What's wrong with it? BETTINA DAMIANI : All the subsidies that Neil just listed. You would like to assume that the city and the state made a clear path to making sure that there were going to be jobs, good-paying jobs for New Yorkers, on the other end. That was going to be the investment, right? We see nothing. There's nothing that says a certain number of jobs has to be set aside for either local New York residents or local Bronx residents, or the number of jobs at all. The city has really washed their hands of making sure there's any accountability on jobs and clear benefits for New Yorkers on the other side of this project, which is very unfortunate. I mean, we're grateful for Congressman Kucinich and Assembly member Brodsky to get involved in this issue. Neither represent New York City, by the way. New York City elected officials - they're filling a void, because local elected officials in New York City have refused to get involved in this project. And we need them. We need them to make sure that the promises in the press releases actually turn out to be something that we can hold them accountable for. JUAN GONZALEZ : And you have, generally speaking, on this issue of tax-exempt financing for economic development, raised numerous questions over the years. It's been one of my favorite topics, how cities are siphoning off their tax bases to create special deals for developers, whether it's sports teams or private companies, where they're, in essence, siphoning off the existing tax base from the municipal government and using it to fund special projects. How rampant is this, not only in New York, but throughout the country? BETTINA DAMIANI : It's a terrible issue regarding not only the issue of financing, but making sure that there are quality jobs for Americans and, in our case, New Yorkers. There's a thing called the economic war among the states, where it seems that so many municipalities and states are worried about fighting one another for the headquarters of a particular agency that they're willing to set aside basic fiscal commonsense and not making sure that there are real quality jobs on the ends of these big deals. Site consultants are prevalent throughout the country that have really manufactured this process, and they make it seem like if the Yankees didn't get their subsidy or if the New York Stock Exchange didn't get a subsidy, they were going to flee somewhere else, without taking into consideration or doing some real due diligence. Where were the Yankees going to go? The Yankees are famous because they're in the Bronx. We have a large media here. We have an incredible fan base here. And it seems none of that was taken in consideration before this huge giveaway was done. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, that's one of the things I think Assembly member Brodsky is trying to investigate, because the city agency that engineered this deal, the Industrial Development Authority, apparently said that the Yankees were threatening to leave New York, of course, the most expensive media market in the country, the most desirable media market in the country. Neil, your sense of whether that was real or not? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah, I mean, and I think everyone knows that the Yankees were not going to move out of New York City, and it's kind of been an open secret for decades now, as long as George Steinbrenner has been demanding a stadium. Where is he going to go? The Yankees are not worth the, whatever, billion dollars that they're worth if they move to Charlotte, North Carolina. But that was the pretense. And the Yankees actually told the judge in a case trying to stop the demolition of the parks, \"Well, if you try and hold up this case, the Yankees could move.\" And, you know, they've been allowed to get away with this. And as Bettina was saying, elected officials never challenged them on this, until, you know, recently Brodsky is trying - been trying to track it down. JUAN GONZALEZ : And, of course, the final irony of all of this is, in the new stadium, once it gets built, as with all these stadiums, the ticket prices for the average baseball fan go through the roof. The prices in Yankee Stadium for box seats now are astronomical -- they're astronomical now, but what they will cost in the new stadium is unbelievable. Could you talk about some of the prices that they've released so far? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah. I mean, they're talking over, you know, $1,000, $2,000 a seat for some of the really premium seats. And I think what you're going to see is -- JUAN GONZALEZ : For one game? NEIL DEMAUSE : For one game, yes. For one game, yes, absolutely. For a whole season, you know, all bets are off. But I think, you know, what you're going to see the Yankees do, they've promised to keep bleacher tickets low. They've promised to keep a certain number of, you know, $25-or-less seats. I think what you're going to see them do is, especially with Brodsky and everyone else paying attention to the soaring costs, I think you're going to see the Yankees keep ticket prices low for the first season or two and, you know, try to say, \"OK, we're holding the line.\" And then, as everybody's clamoring to get tickets, two, three years down the road, you'll see those start to creep up. So, what I'm worried about isn't, next year, is it going to be affordable, but three years from now, is anybody going to be able to get a ticket? JUAN GONZALEZ : Right. And then, of course, the final irony with - because most of these stadiums have luxury boxes that are for corporations that go from $500,000 to $800,000, in the case of the Yankees, per year to rent these boxes, and of course, my newspaper, the Daily News , reported yesterday that in this deal, the City of New York arranged to have its own luxury box at Yankee Stadium available, presumably to city officials, as part of the deal for the financing. Bettina, your response to that? BETTINA DAMIANI : It's aptly coined the landlord suite. And it's just another example of how local elected officials almost seem to be void of feeling that they have responsibility to the public, because they're going to get nice seats, in the long run. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, I want to thank both of you for being with us, Bettina Damiani, the project director of Good Jobs New York, and Neil deMause, who's a writer and the author of Field of Schemes: How the Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money into Private Profit .\n\nAnd I think that, again, this is a matter of serious public policy. When you have New York City, a great American city, which has all these capital infrastructure needs, and when payments get diverted, essentially - payments are not going into areas where the city expects the tax revenues will be coming from, and instead they're diverted in these payments in lieu of taxes, they're intensely serious matters that need to be discussed. And so, that's why the work that Mr. Brodsky is doing and your other guests are involved in is very significant. We're going to continue with our work on the Domestic Policy Subcommittee, and we'll be sure to keep you posted. JUAN GONZALEZ : OK. We're talking with Congressman Dennis Kucinich in Washington, and here also, Bettina Damiani of Good Jobs New York and Neil deMause, the author of Field of Schemes . We're going to return in a minute and to continue the conversation. And before Congressman Kucinich leaves, we also want to ask him about the hearings in Congress, the potential impeachment hearings. We'll be back in a minute. [break] JUAN GONZALEZ : We're talking about the use of public subsidies for sports stadiums. We're joined from Washington, D.C. by Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich. And here in New York, we have Bettina Damiani, the project director of Good Jobs New York, and Neil deMause, author of Field of Schemes: How the Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money into Private Profit . But, Congressman Kucinich, you've been leading the fight for impeachment, and I know you have to go very soon, so I wanted to ask you about an interview with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that aired on The View earlier this week. She was asked about impeachment. JOY BEHAR : You've ruled against impeaching George Bush and Dick Cheney, and now Kucinich is trying to pass that. Why do you insist on not impeaching these people, so that the world and America can really see the crimes that they've committed? REP . NANCY PELOSI : Well, I think that it - I think it was important, when I became Speaker - and it's, by the way, a very important position - President, Vice President, Speaker of the House - I saw it as my responsibility to try to bring a much divided country together to the extent that we could. I thought that impeachment would be divisive for the country. In terms of what we wanted - set out to do, we wanted to raise the minimum wage, give the biggest increase in veterans benefits to veterans in the seventy-seven-year history, then pass research for stem cell research, all of that. This week, we're going to pass equal pay for equal work. It has been a long time in coming - pay equity. We're going to pass legislations for product safety, for toys that children put in their - there's an agenda that you have to get done. You have to try to do it in a bipartisan way. The President has to sign it. If somebody had a crime that the President had committed, that would be a different story. JOY BEHAR : Can they still do it after he's out? BARBARA WALTERS : When we - when I interviewed you last year, you had just begun, and you were going to clean up the mess, remember? REP . NANCY PELOSI : And we did. BARBARA WALTERS : You look around this country, 75 percent of the country - forget George Bush - thinks that Congress is doing a lousy job. ELISABETH HASSELBECK : I think it's 91 percent now. REP . NANCY PELOSI : Well, I don't disagree with that, because largely it's predicated on ending the war in Iraq. That's the main question, and we were not successful. In our House of Representatives, I'm very proud of our members, because they voted overwhelmingly over and over again to bring the war to an end, bring the troops home safely and soon, sent it to the Senate, and it hits a dead end. But in terms of that particular standard, I would say I disapprove, as well. But we do - we passed some of the things I just mentioned, the energy bill. We worked in a bipartisan way, Innovation Agenda. We have to create jobs, expand healthcare, protect the American people and educate our children. And you can't do that if you're trying to impeach the President at the same time, unless you have the goods that this president committed crimes. JUAN GONZALEZ : That was House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Congressman Kucinich, your response to her take on the situation with impeachment? REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, now that I've heard that the Speaker is looking for evidence that crimes may have been committed, I certainly want to direct her attention to the thirty-five articles of impeachment that I presented, which assert quite directly that crimes have been committed, including taking this nation into a war, an illegal war, based on lies; including the deaths of over a million innocent Iraqis, which constitute a war crime; including wiretapping, rendition, torture, illegal detention. There are many examples of laws that have been broken. And the reason why the Judiciary Committee should hold a hearing on the impeachment itself is because there needs to be a public airing of this. So, I have a great deal of respect for Speaker Pelosi, and I think that since she made that statement on The View , there's an opportunity now for us to come forward and to lay all the facts out so that she can reconsider her decision not to permit the Judiciary Committee to proceed with a full impeachment hearing. I just want to state this, that I appreciate that she consented to a hearing on Friday. It was a six-hour hearing, over a dozen witnesses. Twenty-four members of Congress attended. It's being taken seriously. I think the idea that nothing can be done right now because we're on the eve of an election raises questions about our constitutional responsibility to be a check and balance to administration abuse of power. If in fact we're in a war that's based on lies, and we have thousands of troops whose lives are on the line every day, we owe it to them and we owe it to the American people to set straight the public record. And then, whether or not it results in the President being removed from office before the end of his term is another matter. I want to further say that with the possibility of a war in Iran in the offing, a war against Iran, a war that would be a result of a pre-emptive attack, much like the one that the United States launched against Iraq, it becomes very important that we hold this administration to the highest standard of having to verify the statements they make to take us into one war and to try to take us into another. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, Congressman Dennis Kucinich of Ohio, thank you, once again, for joining us. And we're going to continue the conversation here on the stadium issues with Bettina Damiani of Good Jobs New York and Neil deMause, author of Field of Schemes . I'd like to - again, getting back to the stadium deal, this Yankee Stadium is the most expensive stadium in the history of the United States. The actual cost is very hard to get your hands around, because there are some public infrastructure subsidies. But we're talking about a stadium that is going to be somewhere between one and two billion dollars, when you add up all of the actual costs, probably closer to two. And, Neil, could you talk about this - how the public expenditures are being used, even though we're being told that they're not being - public money is not being used directly for the stadium? NEIL DEMAUSE : Sure. I mean, it's something I've been trying to track ever since this was first announced three years ago. There is, as you mentioned, this infrastructure cost, where the public is paying for building new parks to replace the ones that were torn down to make way for the new stadium, paying for moving a water main and other things like that. JUAN GONZALEZ : And when you say parks that were torn down, because that was, itself, a big issue -- NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah, this -- JUAN GONZALEZ : - this is public park land, about a - what was it? Twenty acres or at least -- NEIL DEMAUSE : It was like twenty-two acres that was actually demolished.

I mean, we're grateful for Congressman Kucinich and Assembly member Brodsky to get involved in this issue. Neither represent New York City, by the way. New York City elected officials - they're filling a void, because local elected officials in New York City have refused to get involved in this project. And we need them. We need them to make sure that the promises in the press releases actually turn out to be something that we can hold them accountable for. JUAN GONZALEZ : And you have, generally speaking, on this issue of tax-exempt financing for economic development, raised numerous questions over the years. It's been one of my favorite topics, how cities are siphoning off their tax bases to create special deals for developers, whether it's sports teams or private companies, where they're, in essence, siphoning off the existing tax base from the municipal government and using it to fund special projects. How rampant is this, not only in New York, but throughout the country? BETTINA DAMIANI : It's a terrible issue regarding not only the issue of financing, but making sure that there are quality jobs for Americans and, in our case, New Yorkers. There's a thing called the economic war among the states, where it seems that so many municipalities and states are worried about fighting one another for the headquarters of a particular agency that they're willing to set aside basic fiscal commonsense and not making sure that there are real quality jobs on the ends of these big deals. Site consultants are prevalent throughout the country that have really manufactured this process, and they make it seem like if the Yankees didn't get their subsidy or if the New York Stock Exchange didn't get a subsidy, they were going to flee somewhere else, without taking into consideration or doing some real due diligence. Where were the Yankees going to go? The Yankees are famous because they're in the Bronx. We have a large media here. We have an incredible fan base here. And it seems none of that was taken in consideration before this huge giveaway was done. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, that's one of the things I think Assembly member Brodsky is trying to investigate, because the city agency that engineered this deal, the Industrial Development Authority, apparently said that the Yankees were threatening to leave New York, of course, the most expensive media market in the country, the most desirable media market in the country. Neil, your sense of whether that was real or not? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah, I mean, and I think everyone knows that the Yankees were not going to move out of New York City, and it's kind of been an open secret for decades now, as long as George Steinbrenner has been demanding a stadium. Where is he going to go? The Yankees are not worth the, whatever, billion dollars that they're worth if they move to Charlotte, North Carolina. But that was the pretense. And the Yankees actually told the judge in a case trying to stop the demolition of the parks, \"Well, if you try and hold up this case, the Yankees could move.\" And, you know, they've been allowed to get away with this. And as Bettina was saying, elected officials never challenged them on this, until, you know, recently Brodsky is trying - been trying to track it down. JUAN GONZALEZ : And, of course, the final irony of all of this is, in the new stadium, once it gets built, as with all these stadiums, the ticket prices for the average baseball fan go through the roof. The prices in Yankee Stadium for box seats now are astronomical -- they're astronomical now, but what they will cost in the new stadium is unbelievable. Could you talk about some of the prices that they've released so far? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah. I mean, they're talking over, you know, $1,000, $2,000 a seat for some of the really premium seats. And I think what you're going to see is -- JUAN GONZALEZ : For one game? NEIL DEMAUSE : For one game, yes. For one game, yes, absolutely. For a whole season, you know, all bets are off. But I think, you know, what you're going to see the Yankees do, they've promised to keep bleacher tickets low. They've promised to keep a certain number of, you know, $25-or-less seats. I think what you're going to see them do is, especially with Brodsky and everyone else paying attention to the soaring costs, I think you're going to see the Yankees keep ticket prices low for the first season or two and, you know, try to say, \"OK, we're holding the line.\" And then, as everybody's clamoring to get tickets, two, three years down the road, you'll see those start to creep up. So, what I'm worried about isn't, next year, is it going to be affordable, but three years from now, is anybody going to be able to get a ticket? JUAN GONZALEZ : Right. And then, of course, the final irony with - because most of these stadiums have luxury boxes that are for corporations that go from $500,000 to $800,000, in the case of the Yankees, per year to rent these boxes, and of course, my newspaper, the Daily News , reported yesterday that in this deal, the City of New York arranged to have its own luxury box at Yankee Stadium available, presumably to city officials, as part of the deal for the financing. Bettina, your response to that? BETTINA DAMIANI : It's aptly coined the landlord suite. And it's just another example of how local elected officials almost seem to be void of feeling that they have responsibility to the public, because they're going to get nice seats, in the long run. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, I want to thank both of you for being with us, Bettina Damiani, the project director of Good Jobs New York, and Neil deMause, who's a writer and the author of Field of Schemes: How the Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money into Private Profit .\n\n[break] JUAN GONZALEZ : We're talking about the use of public subsidies for sports stadiums. We're joined from Washington, D.C. by Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich. And here in New York, we have Bettina Damiani, the project director of Good Jobs New York, and Neil deMause, author of Field of Schemes: How the Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money into Private Profit . But, Congressman Kucinich, you've been leading the fight for impeachment, and I know you have to go very soon, so I wanted to ask you about an interview with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that aired on The View earlier this week. She was asked about impeachment. JOY BEHAR : You've ruled against impeaching George Bush and Dick Cheney, and now Kucinich is trying to pass that. Why do you insist on not impeaching these people, so that the world and America can really see the crimes that they've committed? REP . NANCY PELOSI : Well, I think that it - I think it was important, when I became Speaker - and it's, by the way, a very important position - President, Vice President, Speaker of the House - I saw it as my responsibility to try to bring a much divided country together to the extent that we could. I thought that impeachment would be divisive for the country. In terms of what we wanted - set out to do, we wanted to raise the minimum wage, give the biggest increase in veterans benefits to veterans in the seventy-seven-year history, then pass research for stem cell research, all of that. This week, we're going to pass equal pay for equal work. It has been a long time in coming - pay equity. We're going to pass legislations for product safety, for toys that children put in their - there's an agenda that you have to get done. You have to try to do it in a bipartisan way. The President has to sign it. If somebody had a crime that the President had committed, that would be a different story. JOY BEHAR : Can they still do it after he's out? BARBARA WALTERS : When we - when I interviewed you last year, you had just begun, and you were going to clean up the mess, remember? REP . NANCY PELOSI : And we did. BARBARA WALTERS : You look around this country, 75 percent of the country - forget George Bush - thinks that Congress is doing a lousy job. ELISABETH HASSELBECK : I think it's 91 percent now. REP . NANCY PELOSI : Well, I don't disagree with that, because largely it's predicated on ending the war in Iraq. That's the main question, and we were not successful. In our House of Representatives, I'm very proud of our members, because they voted overwhelmingly over and over again to bring the war to an end, bring the troops home safely and soon, sent it to the Senate, and it hits a dead end. But in terms of that particular standard, I would say I disapprove, as well. But we do - we passed some of the things I just mentioned, the energy bill. We worked in a bipartisan way, Innovation Agenda. We have to create jobs, expand healthcare, protect the American people and educate our children. And you can't do that if you're trying to impeach the President at the same time, unless you have the goods that this president committed crimes. JUAN GONZALEZ : That was House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Congressman Kucinich, your response to her take on the situation with impeachment? REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, now that I've heard that the Speaker is looking for evidence that crimes may have been committed, I certainly want to direct her attention to the thirty-five articles of impeachment that I presented, which assert quite directly that crimes have been committed, including taking this nation into a war, an illegal war, based on lies; including the deaths of over a million innocent Iraqis, which constitute a war crime; including wiretapping, rendition, torture, illegal detention. There are many examples of laws that have been broken. And the reason why the Judiciary Committee should hold a hearing on the impeachment itself is because there needs to be a public airing of this. So, I have a great deal of respect for Speaker Pelosi, and I think that since she made that statement on The View , there's an opportunity now for us to come forward and to lay all the facts out so that she can reconsider her decision not to permit the Judiciary Committee to proceed with a full impeachment hearing. I just want to state this, that I appreciate that she consented to a hearing on Friday. It was a six-hour hearing, over a dozen witnesses. Twenty-four members of Congress attended. It's being taken seriously. I think the idea that nothing can be done right now because we're on the eve of an election raises questions about our constitutional responsibility to be a check and balance to administration abuse of power. If in fact we're in a war that's based on lies, and we have thousands of troops whose lives are on the line every day, we owe it to them and we owe it to the American people to set straight the public record. And then, whether or not it results in the President being removed from office before the end of his term is another matter. I want to further say that with the possibility of a war in Iran in the offing, a war against Iran, a war that would be a result of a pre-emptive attack, much like the one that the United States launched against Iraq, it becomes very important that we hold this administration to the highest standard of having to verify the statements they make to take us into one war and to try to take us into another. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, Congressman Dennis Kucinich of Ohio, thank you, once again, for joining us. And we're going to continue the conversation here on the stadium issues with Bettina Damiani of Good Jobs New York and Neil deMause, author of Field of Schemes . I'd like to - again, getting back to the stadium deal, this Yankee Stadium is the most expensive stadium in the history of the United States. The actual cost is very hard to get your hands around, because there are some public infrastructure subsidies. But we're talking about a stadium that is going to be somewhere between one and two billion dollars, when you add up all of the actual costs, probably closer to two. And, Neil, could you talk about this - how the public expenditures are being used, even though we're being told that they're not being - public money is not being used directly for the stadium? NEIL DEMAUSE : Sure. I mean, it's something I've been trying to track ever since this was first announced three years ago. There is, as you mentioned, this infrastructure cost, where the public is paying for building new parks to replace the ones that were torn down to make way for the new stadium, paying for moving a water main and other things like that. JUAN GONZALEZ : And when you say parks that were torn down, because that was, itself, a big issue -- NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah, this -- JUAN GONZALEZ : - this is public park land, about a - what was it? Twenty acres or at least -- NEIL DEMAUSE : It was like twenty-two acres that was actually demolished. It was park that had been there even longer than Yankee Stadium that was demolished to make way for the new stadium. To make up for this, the city and state had to make sure that there was an equal amount of park land that was created. So they're knocking down the old stadium completely. Originally, the team was talking, \"Oh, we're going to save it as a museum.\" It's going to be gone starting next year, and they're going to put some ball fields there. And they've found some space down by the Harlem River where they're going to squeeze in some tennis courts, and sort of little patchwork of parks around different places. The public is paying for all that. The public is paying for the actual demolition of Yankee Stadium, is all going to be public. The public is paying a good chunk for building new parking garages for the Yankees, including one that will be used by the players and VIPs and various folks like that. And the team is getting all sorts of different tax breaks. As Bettina mentioned, they're not going to be paying property taxes. They're going to be getting mortgage-recording taxes. They're going to be getting these tax-exempt bonds that we've been talking about, which is actually a tremendous amount of money, if they get the new $300 million in bonds they're looking for. They're going to be talking about getting more than $300 million worth of tax breaks just on the bonds themselves. So when you add it all up, you get somewhere around $900 million worth of public money that's being spent just on Yankee Stadium. JUAN GONZALEZ : Bettina, those who advocate these stadiums say, \"Why not? This is economic development. It's creating jobs. It's keeping a sort of a -- the psychology of the city by having a professional sports team that the residents can root for.\" What's wrong with it? BETTINA DAMIANI : All the subsidies that Neil just listed. You would like to assume that the city and the state made a clear path to making sure that there were going to be jobs, good-paying jobs for New Yorkers, on the other end. That was going to be the investment, right? We see nothing. There's nothing that says a certain number of jobs has to be set aside for either local New York residents or local Bronx residents, or the number of jobs at all. The city has really washed their hands of making sure there's any accountability on jobs and clear benefits for New Yorkers on the other side of this project, which is very unfortunate.

But I think, you know, what you're going to see the Yankees do, they've promised to keep bleacher tickets low. They've promised to keep a certain number of, you know, $25-or-less seats. I think what you're going to see them do is, especially with Brodsky and everyone else paying attention to the soaring costs, I think you're going to see the Yankees keep ticket prices low for the first season or two and, you know, try to say, \"OK, we're holding the line.\" And then, as everybody's clamoring to get tickets, two, three years down the road, you'll see those start to creep up. So, what I'm worried about isn't, next year, is it going to be affordable, but three years from now, is anybody going to be able to get a ticket? JUAN GONZALEZ : Right. And then, of course, the final irony with - because most of these stadiums have luxury boxes that are for corporations that go from $500,000 to $800,000, in the case of the Yankees, per year to rent these boxes, and of course, my newspaper, the Daily News , reported yesterday that in this deal, the City of New York arranged to have its own luxury box at Yankee Stadium available, presumably to city officials, as part of the deal for the financing. Bettina, your response to that? BETTINA DAMIANI : It's aptly coined the landlord suite. And it's just another example of how local elected officials almost seem to be void of feeling that they have responsibility to the public, because they're going to get nice seats, in the long run. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, I want to thank both of you for being with us, Bettina Damiani, the project director of Good Jobs New York, and Neil deMause, who's a writer and the author of Field of Schemes: How the Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money into Private Profit .\n\nBut, Congressman Kucinich, you've been leading the fight for impeachment, and I know you have to go very soon, so I wanted to ask you about an interview with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that aired on The View earlier this week. She was asked about impeachment. JOY BEHAR : You've ruled against impeaching George Bush and Dick Cheney, and now Kucinich is trying to pass that. Why do you insist on not impeaching these people, so that the world and America can really see the crimes that they've committed? REP . NANCY PELOSI : Well, I think that it - I think it was important, when I became Speaker - and it's, by the way, a very important position - President, Vice President, Speaker of the House - I saw it as my responsibility to try to bring a much divided country together to the extent that we could. I thought that impeachment would be divisive for the country. In terms of what we wanted - set out to do, we wanted to raise the minimum wage, give the biggest increase in veterans benefits to veterans in the seventy-seven-year history, then pass research for stem cell research, all of that. This week, we're going to pass equal pay for equal work. It has been a long time in coming - pay equity. We're going to pass legislations for product safety, for toys that children put in their - there's an agenda that you have to get done. You have to try to do it in a bipartisan way. The President has to sign it. If somebody had a crime that the President had committed, that would be a different story. JOY BEHAR : Can they still do it after he's out? BARBARA WALTERS : When we - when I interviewed you last year, you had just begun, and you were going to clean up the mess, remember? REP . NANCY PELOSI : And we did. BARBARA WALTERS : You look around this country, 75 percent of the country - forget George Bush - thinks that Congress is doing a lousy job. ELISABETH HASSELBECK : I think it's 91 percent now. REP . NANCY PELOSI : Well, I don't disagree with that, because largely it's predicated on ending the war in Iraq. That's the main question, and we were not successful. In our House of Representatives, I'm very proud of our members, because they voted overwhelmingly over and over again to bring the war to an end, bring the troops home safely and soon, sent it to the Senate, and it hits a dead end. But in terms of that particular standard, I would say I disapprove, as well. But we do - we passed some of the things I just mentioned, the energy bill. We worked in a bipartisan way, Innovation Agenda. We have to create jobs, expand healthcare, protect the American people and educate our children. And you can't do that if you're trying to impeach the President at the same time, unless you have the goods that this president committed crimes. JUAN GONZALEZ : That was House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Congressman Kucinich, your response to her take on the situation with impeachment? REP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, now that I've heard that the Speaker is looking for evidence that crimes may have been committed, I certainly want to direct her attention to the thirty-five articles of impeachment that I presented, which assert quite directly that crimes have been committed, including taking this nation into a war, an illegal war, based on lies; including the deaths of over a million innocent Iraqis, which constitute a war crime; including wiretapping, rendition, torture, illegal detention. There are many examples of laws that have been broken. And the reason why the Judiciary Committee should hold a hearing on the impeachment itself is because there needs to be a public airing of this. So, I have a great deal of respect for Speaker Pelosi, and I think that since she made that statement on The View , there's an opportunity now for us to come forward and to lay all the facts out so that she can reconsider her decision not to permit the Judiciary Committee to proceed with a full impeachment hearing. I just want to state this, that I appreciate that she consented to a hearing on Friday. It was a six-hour hearing, over a dozen witnesses. Twenty-four members of Congress attended. It's being taken seriously. I think the idea that nothing can be done right now because we're on the eve of an election raises questions about our constitutional responsibility to be a check and balance to administration abuse of power. If in fact we're in a war that's based on lies, and we have thousands of troops whose lives are on the line every day, we owe it to them and we owe it to the American people to set straight the public record. And then, whether or not it results in the President being removed from office before the end of his term is another matter. I want to further say that with the possibility of a war in Iran in the offing, a war against Iran, a war that would be a result of a pre-emptive attack, much like the one that the United States launched against Iraq, it becomes very important that we hold this administration to the highest standard of having to verify the statements they make to take us into one war and to try to take us into another. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, Congressman Dennis Kucinich of Ohio, thank you, once again, for joining us. And we're going to continue the conversation here on the stadium issues with Bettina Damiani of Good Jobs New York and Neil deMause, author of Field of Schemes . I'd like to - again, getting back to the stadium deal, this Yankee Stadium is the most expensive stadium in the history of the United States. The actual cost is very hard to get your hands around, because there are some public infrastructure subsidies. But we're talking about a stadium that is going to be somewhere between one and two billion dollars, when you add up all of the actual costs, probably closer to two. And, Neil, could you talk about this - how the public expenditures are being used, even though we're being told that they're not being - public money is not being used directly for the stadium? NEIL DEMAUSE : Sure. I mean, it's something I've been trying to track ever since this was first announced three years ago. There is, as you mentioned, this infrastructure cost, where the public is paying for building new parks to replace the ones that were torn down to make way for the new stadium, paying for moving a water main and other things like that. JUAN GONZALEZ : And when you say parks that were torn down, because that was, itself, a big issue -- NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah, this -- JUAN GONZALEZ : - this is public park land, about a - what was it? Twenty acres or at least -- NEIL DEMAUSE : It was like twenty-two acres that was actually demolished. It was park that had been there even longer than Yankee Stadium that was demolished to make way for the new stadium. To make up for this, the city and state had to make sure that there was an equal amount of park land that was created. So they're knocking down the old stadium completely. Originally, the team was talking, \"Oh, we're going to save it as a museum.\" It's going to be gone starting next year, and they're going to put some ball fields there. And they've found some space down by the Harlem River where they're going to squeeze in some tennis courts, and sort of little patchwork of parks around different places. The public is paying for all that. The public is paying for the actual demolition of Yankee Stadium, is all going to be public. The public is paying a good chunk for building new parking garages for the Yankees, including one that will be used by the players and VIPs and various folks like that. And the team is getting all sorts of different tax breaks. As Bettina mentioned, they're not going to be paying property taxes. They're going to be getting mortgage-recording taxes. They're going to be getting these tax-exempt bonds that we've been talking about, which is actually a tremendous amount of money, if they get the new $300 million in bonds they're looking for. They're going to be talking about getting more than $300 million worth of tax breaks just on the bonds themselves. So when you add it all up, you get somewhere around $900 million worth of public money that's being spent just on Yankee Stadium. JUAN GONZALEZ : Bettina, those who advocate these stadiums say, \"Why not? This is economic development. It's creating jobs. It's keeping a sort of a -- the psychology of the city by having a professional sports team that the residents can root for.\" What's wrong with it? BETTINA DAMIANI : All the subsidies that Neil just listed. You would like to assume that the city and the state made a clear path to making sure that there were going to be jobs, good-paying jobs for New Yorkers, on the other end. That was going to be the investment, right? We see nothing. There's nothing that says a certain number of jobs has to be set aside for either local New York residents or local Bronx residents, or the number of jobs at all. The city has really washed their hands of making sure there's any accountability on jobs and clear benefits for New Yorkers on the other side of this project, which is very unfortunate. I mean, we're grateful for Congressman Kucinich and Assembly member Brodsky to get involved in this issue. Neither represent New York City, by the way. New York City elected officials - they're filling a void, because local elected officials in New York City have refused to get involved in this project. And we need them. We need them to make sure that the promises in the press releases actually turn out to be something that we can hold them accountable for. JUAN GONZALEZ : And you have, generally speaking, on this issue of tax-exempt financing for economic development, raised numerous questions over the years. It's been one of my favorite topics, how cities are siphoning off their tax bases to create special deals for developers, whether it's sports teams or private companies, where they're, in essence, siphoning off the existing tax base from the municipal government and using it to fund special projects. How rampant is this, not only in New York, but throughout the country? BETTINA DAMIANI : It's a terrible issue regarding not only the issue of financing, but making sure that there are quality jobs for Americans and, in our case, New Yorkers. There's a thing called the economic war among the states, where it seems that so many municipalities and states are worried about fighting one another for the headquarters of a particular agency that they're willing to set aside basic fiscal commonsense and not making sure that there are real quality jobs on the ends of these big deals. Site consultants are prevalent throughout the country that have really manufactured this process, and they make it seem like if the Yankees didn't get their subsidy or if the New York Stock Exchange didn't get a subsidy, they were going to flee somewhere else, without taking into consideration or doing some real due diligence. Where were the Yankees going to go? The Yankees are famous because they're in the Bronx. We have a large media here. We have an incredible fan base here. And it seems none of that was taken in consideration before this huge giveaway was done. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, that's one of the things I think Assembly member Brodsky is trying to investigate, because the city agency that engineered this deal, the Industrial Development Authority, apparently said that the Yankees were threatening to leave New York, of course, the most expensive media market in the country, the most desirable media market in the country. Neil, your sense of whether that was real or not? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah, I mean, and I think everyone knows that the Yankees were not going to move out of New York City, and it's kind of been an open secret for decades now, as long as George Steinbrenner has been demanding a stadium. Where is he going to go? The Yankees are not worth the, whatever, billion dollars that they're worth if they move to Charlotte, North Carolina. But that was the pretense. And the Yankees actually told the judge in a case trying to stop the demolition of the parks, \"Well, if you try and hold up this case, the Yankees could move.\" And, you know, they've been allowed to get away with this. And as Bettina was saying, elected officials never challenged them on this, until, you know, recently Brodsky is trying - been trying to track it down. JUAN GONZALEZ : And, of course, the final irony of all of this is, in the new stadium, once it gets built, as with all these stadiums, the ticket prices for the average baseball fan go through the roof. The prices in Yankee Stadium for box seats now are astronomical -- they're astronomical now, but what they will cost in the new stadium is unbelievable. Could you talk about some of the prices that they've released so far? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah. I mean, they're talking over, you know, $1,000, $2,000 a seat for some of the really premium seats. And I think what you're going to see is -- JUAN GONZALEZ : For one game? NEIL DEMAUSE : For one game, yes. For one game, yes, absolutely. For a whole season, you know, all bets are off. But I think, you know, what you're going to see the Yankees do, they've promised to keep bleacher tickets low. They've promised to keep a certain number of, you know, $25-or-less seats. I think what you're going to see them do is, especially with Brodsky and everyone else paying attention to the soaring costs, I think you're going to see the Yankees keep ticket prices low for the first season or two and, you know, try to say, \"OK, we're holding the line.\" And then, as everybody's clamoring to get tickets, two, three years down the road, you'll see those start to creep up. So, what I'm worried about isn't, next year, is it going to be affordable, but three years from now, is anybody going to be able to get a ticket? JUAN GONZALEZ : Right. And then, of course, the final irony with - because most of these stadiums have luxury boxes that are for corporations that go from $500,000 to $800,000, in the case of the Yankees, per year to rent these boxes, and of course, my newspaper, the Daily News , reported yesterday that in this deal, the City of New York arranged to have its own luxury box at Yankee Stadium available, presumably to city officials, as part of the deal for the financing.

I want to further say that with the possibility of a war in Iran in the offing, a war against Iran, a war that would be a result of a pre-emptive attack, much like the one that the United States launched against Iraq, it becomes very important that we hold this administration to the highest standard of having to verify the statements they make to take us into one war and to try to take us into another. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, Congressman Dennis Kucinich of Ohio, thank you, once again, for joining us. And we're going to continue the conversation here on the stadium issues with Bettina Damiani of Good Jobs New York and Neil deMause, author of Field of Schemes . I'd like to - again, getting back to the stadium deal, this Yankee Stadium is the most expensive stadium in the history of the United States. The actual cost is very hard to get your hands around, because there are some public infrastructure subsidies. But we're talking about a stadium that is going to be somewhere between one and two billion dollars, when you add up all of the actual costs, probably closer to two. And, Neil, could you talk about this - how the public expenditures are being used, even though we're being told that they're not being - public money is not being used directly for the stadium? NEIL DEMAUSE : Sure. I mean, it's something I've been trying to track ever since this was first announced three years ago. There is, as you mentioned, this infrastructure cost, where the public is paying for building new parks to replace the ones that were torn down to make way for the new stadium, paying for moving a water main and other things like that. JUAN GONZALEZ : And when you say parks that were torn down, because that was, itself, a big issue -- NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah, this -- JUAN GONZALEZ : - this is public park land, about a - what was it? Twenty acres or at least -- NEIL DEMAUSE : It was like twenty-two acres that was actually demolished. It was park that had been there even longer than Yankee Stadium that was demolished to make way for the new stadium. To make up for this, the city and state had to make sure that there was an equal amount of park land that was created. So they're knocking down the old stadium completely. Originally, the team was talking, \"Oh, we're going to save it as a museum.\" It's going to be gone starting next year, and they're going to put some ball fields there. And they've found some space down by the Harlem River where they're going to squeeze in some tennis courts, and sort of little patchwork of parks around different places. The public is paying for all that. The public is paying for the actual demolition of Yankee Stadium, is all going to be public. The public is paying a good chunk for building new parking garages for the Yankees, including one that will be used by the players and VIPs and various folks like that. And the team is getting all sorts of different tax breaks. As Bettina mentioned, they're not going to be paying property taxes. They're going to be getting mortgage-recording taxes. They're going to be getting these tax-exempt bonds that we've been talking about, which is actually a tremendous amount of money, if they get the new $300 million in bonds they're looking for. They're going to be talking about getting more than $300 million worth of tax breaks just on the bonds themselves. So when you add it all up, you get somewhere around $900 million worth of public money that's being spent just on Yankee Stadium. JUAN GONZALEZ : Bettina, those who advocate these stadiums say, \"Why not? This is economic development. It's creating jobs. It's keeping a sort of a -- the psychology of the city by having a professional sports team that the residents can root for.\" What's wrong with it? BETTINA DAMIANI : All the subsidies that Neil just listed. You would like to assume that the city and the state made a clear path to making sure that there were going to be jobs, good-paying jobs for New Yorkers, on the other end. That was going to be the investment, right? We see nothing. There's nothing that says a certain number of jobs has to be set aside for either local New York residents or local Bronx residents, or the number of jobs at all. The city has really washed their hands of making sure there's any accountability on jobs and clear benefits for New Yorkers on the other side of this project, which is very unfortunate. I mean, we're grateful for Congressman Kucinich and Assembly member Brodsky to get involved in this issue. Neither represent New York City, by the way. New York City elected officials - they're filling a void, because local elected officials in New York City have refused to get involved in this project. And we need them. We need them to make sure that the promises in the press releases actually turn out to be something that we can hold them accountable for. JUAN GONZALEZ : And you have, generally speaking, on this issue of tax-exempt financing for economic development, raised numerous questions over the years. It's been one of my favorite topics, how cities are siphoning off their tax bases to create special deals for developers, whether it's sports teams or private companies, where they're, in essence, siphoning off the existing tax base from the municipal government and using it to fund special projects. How rampant is this, not only in New York, but throughout the country? BETTINA DAMIANI : It's a terrible issue regarding not only the issue of financing, but making sure that there are quality jobs for Americans and, in our case, New Yorkers. There's a thing called the economic war among the states, where it seems that so many municipalities and states are worried about fighting one another for the headquarters of a particular agency that they're willing to set aside basic fiscal commonsense and not making sure that there are real quality jobs on the ends of these big deals. Site consultants are prevalent throughout the country that have really manufactured this process, and they make it seem like if the Yankees didn't get their subsidy or if the New York Stock Exchange didn't get a subsidy, they were going to flee somewhere else, without taking into consideration or doing some real due diligence. Where were the Yankees going to go? The Yankees are famous because they're in the Bronx. We have a large media here. We have an incredible fan base here. And it seems none of that was taken in consideration before this huge giveaway was done. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, that's one of the things I think Assembly member Brodsky is trying to investigate, because the city agency that engineered this deal, the Industrial Development Authority, apparently said that the Yankees were threatening to leave New York, of course, the most expensive media market in the country, the most desirable media market in the country. Neil, your sense of whether that was real or not? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah, I mean, and I think everyone knows that the Yankees were not going to move out of New York City, and it's kind of been an open secret for decades now, as long as George Steinbrenner has been demanding a stadium. Where is he going to go? The Yankees are not worth the, whatever, billion dollars that they're worth if they move to Charlotte, North Carolina. But that was the pretense. And the Yankees actually told the judge in a case trying to stop the demolition of the parks, \"Well, if you try and hold up this case, the Yankees could move.\" And, you know, they've been allowed to get away with this. And as Bettina was saying, elected officials never challenged them on this, until, you know, recently Brodsky is trying - been trying to track it down. JUAN GONZALEZ : And, of course, the final irony of all of this is, in the new stadium, once it gets built, as with all these stadiums, the ticket prices for the average baseball fan go through the roof. The prices in Yankee Stadium for box seats now are astronomical -- they're astronomical now, but what they will cost in the new stadium is unbelievable. Could you talk about some of the prices that they've released so far? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah. I mean, they're talking over, you know, $1,000, $2,000 a seat for some of the really premium seats. And I think what you're going to see is -- JUAN GONZALEZ : For one game? NEIL DEMAUSE : For one game, yes. For one game, yes, absolutely. For a whole season, you know, all bets are off. But I think, you know, what you're going to see the Yankees do, they've promised to keep bleacher tickets low. They've promised to keep a certain number of, you know, $25-or-less seats. I think what you're going to see them do is, especially with Brodsky and everyone else paying attention to the soaring costs, I think you're going to see the Yankees keep ticket prices low for the first season or two and, you know, try to say, \"OK, we're holding the line.\" And then, as everybody's clamoring to get tickets, two, three years down the road, you'll see those start to creep up. So, what I'm worried about isn't, next year, is it going to be affordable, but three years from now, is anybody going to be able to get a ticket? JUAN GONZALEZ : Right. And then, of course, the final irony with - because most of these stadiums have luxury boxes that are for corporations that go from $500,000 to $800,000, in the case of the Yankees, per year to rent these boxes, and of course, my newspaper, the Daily News , reported yesterday that in this deal, the City of New York arranged to have its own luxury box at Yankee Stadium available, presumably to city officials, as part of the deal for the financing. Bettina, your response to that? BETTINA DAMIANI : It's aptly coined the landlord suite. And it's just another example of how local elected officials almost seem to be void of feeling that they have responsibility to the public, because they're going to get nice seats, in the long run. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, I want to thank both of you for being with us, Bettina Damiani, the project director of Good Jobs New York, and Neil deMause, who's a writer and the author of Field of Schemes: How the Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money into Private Profit .\n\nREP . DENNIS KUCINICH : Well, now that I've heard that the Speaker is looking for evidence that crimes may have been committed, I certainly want to direct her attention to the thirty-five articles of impeachment that I presented, which assert quite directly that crimes have been committed, including taking this nation into a war, an illegal war, based on lies; including the deaths of over a million innocent Iraqis, which constitute a war crime; including wiretapping, rendition, torture, illegal detention. There are many examples of laws that have been broken. And the reason why the Judiciary Committee should hold a hearing on the impeachment itself is because there needs to be a public airing of this. So, I have a great deal of respect for Speaker Pelosi, and I think that since she made that statement on The View , there's an opportunity now for us to come forward and to lay all the facts out so that she can reconsider her decision not to permit the Judiciary Committee to proceed with a full impeachment hearing. I just want to state this, that I appreciate that she consented to a hearing on Friday. It was a six-hour hearing, over a dozen witnesses. Twenty-four members of Congress attended. It's being taken seriously. I think the idea that nothing can be done right now because we're on the eve of an election raises questions about our constitutional responsibility to be a check and balance to administration abuse of power. If in fact we're in a war that's based on lies, and we have thousands of troops whose lives are on the line every day, we owe it to them and we owe it to the American people to set straight the public record. And then, whether or not it results in the President being removed from office before the end of his term is another matter. I want to further say that with the possibility of a war in Iran in the offing, a war against Iran, a war that would be a result of a pre-emptive attack, much like the one that the United States launched against Iraq, it becomes very important that we hold this administration to the highest standard of having to verify the statements they make to take us into one war and to try to take us into another.

I want to further say that with the possibility of a war in Iran in the offing, a war against Iran, a war that would be a result of a pre-emptive attack, much like the one that the United States launched against Iraq, it becomes very important that we hold this administration to the highest standard of having to verify the statements they make to take us into one war and to try to take us into another. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, Congressman Dennis Kucinich of Ohio, thank you, once again, for joining us. And we're going to continue the conversation here on the stadium issues with Bettina Damiani of Good Jobs New York and Neil deMause, author of Field of Schemes . I'd like to - again, getting back to the stadium deal, this Yankee Stadium is the most expensive stadium in the history of the United States. The actual cost is very hard to get your hands around, because there are some public infrastructure subsidies. But we're talking about a stadium that is going to be somewhere between one and two billion dollars, when you add up all of the actual costs, probably closer to two. And, Neil, could you talk about this - how the public expenditures are being used, even though we're being told that they're not being - public money is not being used directly for the stadium? NEIL DEMAUSE : Sure. I mean, it's something I've been trying to track ever since this was first announced three years ago. There is, as you mentioned, this infrastructure cost, where the public is paying for building new parks to replace the ones that were torn down to make way for the new stadium, paying for moving a water main and other things like that. JUAN GONZALEZ : And when you say parks that were torn down, because that was, itself, a big issue -- NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah, this -- JUAN GONZALEZ : - this is public park land, about a - what was it? Twenty acres or at least -- NEIL DEMAUSE : It was like twenty-two acres that was actually demolished. It was park that had been there even longer than Yankee Stadium that was demolished to make way for the new stadium. To make up for this, the city and state had to make sure that there was an equal amount of park land that was created. So they're knocking down the old stadium completely. Originally, the team was talking, \"Oh, we're going to save it as a museum.\" It's going to be gone starting next year, and they're going to put some ball fields there. And they've found some space down by the Harlem River where they're going to squeeze in some tennis courts, and sort of little patchwork of parks around different places. The public is paying for all that. The public is paying for the actual demolition of Yankee Stadium, is all going to be public. The public is paying a good chunk for building new parking garages for the Yankees, including one that will be used by the players and VIPs and various folks like that. And the team is getting all sorts of different tax breaks. As Bettina mentioned, they're not going to be paying property taxes. They're going to be getting mortgage-recording taxes. They're going to be getting these tax-exempt bonds that we've been talking about, which is actually a tremendous amount of money, if they get the new $300 million in bonds they're looking for. They're going to be talking about getting more than $300 million worth of tax breaks just on the bonds themselves. So when you add it all up, you get somewhere around $900 million worth of public money that's being spent just on Yankee Stadium. JUAN GONZALEZ : Bettina, those who advocate these stadiums say, \"Why not? This is economic development. It's creating jobs. It's keeping a sort of a -- the psychology of the city by having a professional sports team that the residents can root for.\" What's wrong with it? BETTINA DAMIANI : All the subsidies that Neil just listed. You would like to assume that the city and the state made a clear path to making sure that there were going to be jobs, good-paying jobs for New Yorkers, on the other end. That was going to be the investment, right? We see nothing. There's nothing that says a certain number of jobs has to be set aside for either local New York residents or local Bronx residents, or the number of jobs at all. The city has really washed their hands of making sure there's any accountability on jobs and clear benefits for New Yorkers on the other side of this project, which is very unfortunate. I mean, we're grateful for Congressman Kucinich and Assembly member Brodsky to get involved in this issue. Neither represent New York City, by the way. New York City elected officials - they're filling a void, because local elected officials in New York City have refused to get involved in this project. And we need them. We need them to make sure that the promises in the press releases actually turn out to be something that we can hold them accountable for. JUAN GONZALEZ : And you have, generally speaking, on this issue of tax-exempt financing for economic development, raised numerous questions over the years. It's been one of my favorite topics, how cities are siphoning off their tax bases to create special deals for developers, whether it's sports teams or private companies, where they're, in essence, siphoning off the existing tax base from the municipal government and using it to fund special projects. How rampant is this, not only in New York, but throughout the country? BETTINA DAMIANI : It's a terrible issue regarding not only the issue of financing, but making sure that there are quality jobs for Americans and, in our case, New Yorkers. There's a thing called the economic war among the states, where it seems that so many municipalities and states are worried about fighting one another for the headquarters of a particular agency that they're willing to set aside basic fiscal commonsense and not making sure that there are real quality jobs on the ends of these big deals. Site consultants are prevalent throughout the country that have really manufactured this process, and they make it seem like if the Yankees didn't get their subsidy or if the New York Stock Exchange didn't get a subsidy, they were going to flee somewhere else, without taking into consideration or doing some real due diligence. Where were the Yankees going to go? The Yankees are famous because they're in the Bronx. We have a large media here. We have an incredible fan base here. And it seems none of that was taken in consideration before this huge giveaway was done. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, that's one of the things I think Assembly member Brodsky is trying to investigate, because the city agency that engineered this deal, the Industrial Development Authority, apparently said that the Yankees were threatening to leave New York, of course, the most expensive media market in the country, the most desirable media market in the country. Neil, your sense of whether that was real or not? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah, I mean, and I think everyone knows that the Yankees were not going to move out of New York City, and it's kind of been an open secret for decades now, as long as George Steinbrenner has been demanding a stadium. Where is he going to go? The Yankees are not worth the, whatever, billion dollars that they're worth if they move to Charlotte, North Carolina. But that was the pretense. And the Yankees actually told the judge in a case trying to stop the demolition of the parks, \"Well, if you try and hold up this case, the Yankees could move.\" And, you know, they've been allowed to get away with this. And as Bettina was saying, elected officials never challenged them on this, until, you know, recently Brodsky is trying - been trying to track it down. JUAN GONZALEZ : And, of course, the final irony of all of this is, in the new stadium, once it gets built, as with all these stadiums, the ticket prices for the average baseball fan go through the roof. The prices in Yankee Stadium for box seats now are astronomical -- they're astronomical now, but what they will cost in the new stadium is unbelievable. Could you talk about some of the prices that they've released so far? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah. I mean, they're talking over, you know, $1,000, $2,000 a seat for some of the really premium seats. And I think what you're going to see is -- JUAN GONZALEZ : For one game? NEIL DEMAUSE : For one game, yes. For one game, yes, absolutely. For a whole season, you know, all bets are off. But I think, you know, what you're going to see the Yankees do, they've promised to keep bleacher tickets low. They've promised to keep a certain number of, you know, $25-or-less seats. I think what you're going to see them do is, especially with Brodsky and everyone else paying attention to the soaring costs, I think you're going to see the Yankees keep ticket prices low for the first season or two and, you know, try to say, \"OK, we're holding the line.\" And then, as everybody's clamoring to get tickets, two, three years down the road, you'll see those start to creep up. So, what I'm worried about isn't, next year, is it going to be affordable, but three years from now, is anybody going to be able to get a ticket? JUAN GONZALEZ : Right. And then, of course, the final irony with - because most of these stadiums have luxury boxes that are for corporations that go from $500,000 to $800,000, in the case of the Yankees, per year to rent these boxes, and of course, my newspaper, the Daily News , reported yesterday that in this deal, the City of New York arranged to have its own luxury box at Yankee Stadium available, presumably to city officials, as part of the deal for the financing. Bettina, your response to that? BETTINA DAMIANI : It's aptly coined the landlord suite. And it's just another example of how local elected officials almost seem to be void of feeling that they have responsibility to the public, because they're going to get nice seats, in the long run. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, I want to thank both of you for being with us, Bettina Damiani, the project director of Good Jobs New York, and Neil deMause, who's a writer and the author of Field of Schemes: How the Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money into Private Profit .\n\nI think the idea that nothing can be done right now because we're on the eve of an election raises questions about our constitutional responsibility to be a check and balance to administration abuse of power. If in fact we're in a war that's based on lies, and we have thousands of troops whose lives are on the line every day, we owe it to them and we owe it to the American people to set straight the public record. And then, whether or not it results in the President being removed from office before the end of his term is another matter. I want to further say that with the possibility of a war in Iran in the offing, a war against Iran, a war that would be a result of a pre-emptive attack, much like the one that the United States launched against Iraq, it becomes very important that we hold this administration to the highest standard of having to verify the statements they make to take us into one war and to try to take us into another.

The public is paying for all that. The public is paying for the actual demolition of Yankee Stadium, is all going to be public. The public is paying a good chunk for building new parking garages for the Yankees, including one that will be used by the players and VIPs and various folks like that.

It's keeping a sort of a -- the psychology of the city by having a professional sports team that the residents can root for.\" What's wrong with it? BETTINA DAMIANI : All the subsidies that Neil just listed. You would like to assume that the city and the state made a clear path to making sure that there were going to be jobs, good-paying jobs for New Yorkers, on the other end. That was going to be the investment, right? We see nothing. There's nothing that says a certain number of jobs has to be set aside for either local New York residents or local Bronx residents, or the number of jobs at all. The city has really washed their hands of making sure there's any accountability on jobs and clear benefits for New Yorkers on the other side of this project, which is very unfortunate. I mean, we're grateful for Congressman Kucinich and Assembly member Brodsky to get involved in this issue. Neither represent New York City, by the way. New York City elected officials - they're filling a void, because local elected officials in New York City have refused to get involved in this project. And we need them. We need them to make sure that the promises in the press releases actually turn out to be something that we can hold them accountable for. JUAN GONZALEZ : And you have, generally speaking, on this issue of tax-exempt financing for economic development, raised numerous questions over the years. It's been one of my favorite topics, how cities are siphoning off their tax bases to create special deals for developers, whether it's sports teams or private companies, where they're, in essence, siphoning off the existing tax base from the municipal government and using it to fund special projects. How rampant is this, not only in New York, but throughout the country? BETTINA DAMIANI : It's a terrible issue regarding not only the issue of financing, but making sure that there are quality jobs for Americans and, in our case, New Yorkers. There's a thing called the economic war among the states, where it seems that so many municipalities and states are worried about fighting one another for the headquarters of a particular agency that they're willing to set aside basic fiscal commonsense and not making sure that there are real quality jobs on the ends of these big deals. Site consultants are prevalent throughout the country that have really manufactured this process, and they make it seem like if the Yankees didn't get their subsidy or if the New York Stock Exchange didn't get a subsidy, they were going to flee somewhere else, without taking into consideration or doing some real due diligence. Where were the Yankees going to go? The Yankees are famous because they're in the Bronx. We have a large media here. We have an incredible fan base here. And it seems none of that was taken in consideration before this huge giveaway was done. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, that's one of the things I think Assembly member Brodsky is trying to investigate, because the city agency that engineered this deal, the Industrial Development Authority, apparently said that the Yankees were threatening to leave New York, of course, the most expensive media market in the country, the most desirable media market in the country. Neil, your sense of whether that was real or not? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah, I mean, and I think everyone knows that the Yankees were not going to move out of New York City, and it's kind of been an open secret for decades now, as long as George Steinbrenner has been demanding a stadium. Where is he going to go? The Yankees are not worth the, whatever, billion dollars that they're worth if they move to Charlotte, North Carolina. But that was the pretense. And the Yankees actually told the judge in a case trying to stop the demolition of the parks, \"Well, if you try and hold up this case, the Yankees could move.\" And, you know, they've been allowed to get away with this. And as Bettina was saying, elected officials never challenged them on this, until, you know, recently Brodsky is trying - been trying to track it down. JUAN GONZALEZ : And, of course, the final irony of all of this is, in the new stadium, once it gets built, as with all these stadiums, the ticket prices for the average baseball fan go through the roof. The prices in Yankee Stadium for box seats now are astronomical -- they're astronomical now, but what they will cost in the new stadium is unbelievable. Could you talk about some of the prices that they've released so far? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah. I mean, they're talking over, you know, $1,000, $2,000 a seat for some of the really premium seats. And I think what you're going to see is -- JUAN GONZALEZ : For one game? NEIL DEMAUSE : For one game, yes. For one game, yes, absolutely. For a whole season, you know, all bets are off. But I think, you know, what you're going to see the Yankees do, they've promised to keep bleacher tickets low. They've promised to keep a certain number of, you know, $25-or-less seats. I think what you're going to see them do is, especially with Brodsky and everyone else paying attention to the soaring costs, I think you're going to see the Yankees keep ticket prices low for the first season or two and, you know, try to say, \"OK, we're holding the line.\" And then, as everybody's clamoring to get tickets, two, three years down the road, you'll see those start to creep up. So, what I'm worried about isn't, next year, is it going to be affordable, but three years from now, is anybody going to be able to get a ticket? JUAN GONZALEZ : Right. And then, of course, the final irony with - because most of these stadiums have luxury boxes that are for corporations that go from $500,000 to $800,000, in the case of the Yankees, per year to rent these boxes, and of course, my newspaper, the Daily News , reported yesterday that in this deal, the City of New York arranged to have its own luxury box at Yankee Stadium available, presumably to city officials, as part of the deal for the financing. Bettina, your response to that? BETTINA DAMIANI : It's aptly coined the landlord suite. And it's just another example of how local elected officials almost seem to be void of feeling that they have responsibility to the public, because they're going to get nice seats, in the long run. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, I want to thank both of you for being with us, Bettina Damiani, the project director of Good Jobs New York, and Neil deMause, who's a writer and the author of Field of Schemes: How the Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money into Private Profit .\n\nAnd we're going to continue the conversation here on the stadium issues with Bettina Damiani of Good Jobs New York and Neil deMause, author of Field of Schemes . I'd like to - again, getting back to the stadium deal, this Yankee Stadium is the most expensive stadium in the history of the United States. The actual cost is very hard to get your hands around, because there are some public infrastructure subsidies. But we're talking about a stadium that is going to be somewhere between one and two billion dollars, when you add up all of the actual costs, probably closer to two. And, Neil, could you talk about this - how the public expenditures are being used, even though we're being told that they're not being - public money is not being used directly for the stadium? NEIL DEMAUSE : Sure. I mean, it's something I've been trying to track ever since this was first announced three years ago. There is, as you mentioned, this infrastructure cost, where the public is paying for building new parks to replace the ones that were torn down to make way for the new stadium, paying for moving a water main and other things like that. JUAN GONZALEZ : And when you say parks that were torn down, because that was, itself, a big issue -- NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah, this -- JUAN GONZALEZ : - this is public park land, about a - what was it? Twenty acres or at least -- NEIL DEMAUSE : It was like twenty-two acres that was actually demolished. It was park that had been there even longer than Yankee Stadium that was demolished to make way for the new stadium. To make up for this, the city and state had to make sure that there was an equal amount of park land that was created. So they're knocking down the old stadium completely. Originally, the team was talking, \"Oh, we're going to save it as a museum.\" It's going to be gone starting next year, and they're going to put some ball fields there. And they've found some space down by the Harlem River where they're going to squeeze in some tennis courts, and sort of little patchwork of parks around different places. The public is paying for all that. The public is paying for the actual demolition of Yankee Stadium, is all going to be public. The public is paying a good chunk for building new parking garages for the Yankees, including one that will be used by the players and VIPs and various folks like that. And the team is getting all sorts of different tax breaks. As Bettina mentioned, they're not going to be paying property taxes. They're going to be getting mortgage-recording taxes. They're going to be getting these tax-exempt bonds that we've been talking about, which is actually a tremendous amount of money, if they get the new $300 million in bonds they're looking for. They're going to be talking about getting more than $300 million worth of tax breaks just on the bonds themselves. So when you add it all up, you get somewhere around $900 million worth of public money that's being spent just on Yankee Stadium. JUAN GONZALEZ : Bettina, those who advocate these stadiums say, \"Why not? This is economic development. It's creating jobs. It's keeping a sort of a -- the psychology of the city by having a professional sports team that the residents can root for.\" What's wrong with it? BETTINA DAMIANI : All the subsidies that Neil just listed. You would like to assume that the city and the state made a clear path to making sure that there were going to be jobs, good-paying jobs for New Yorkers, on the other end.

JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, I want to thank both of you for being with us, Bettina Damiani, the project director of Good Jobs New York, and Neil deMause, who's a writer and the author of Field of Schemes: How the Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money into Private Profit .\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : And when you say parks that were torn down, because that was, itself, a big issue -- NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah, this -- JUAN GONZALEZ : - this is public park land, about a - what was it? Twenty acres or at least -- NEIL DEMAUSE : It was like twenty-two acres that was actually demolished. It was park that had been there even longer than Yankee Stadium that was demolished to make way for the new stadium. To make up for this, the city and state had to make sure that there was an equal amount of park land that was created. So they're knocking down the old stadium completely. Originally, the team was talking, \"Oh, we're going to save it as a museum.\" It's going to be gone starting next year, and they're going to put some ball fields there. And they've found some space down by the Harlem River where they're going to squeeze in some tennis courts, and sort of little patchwork of parks around different places. The public is paying for all that. The public is paying for the actual demolition of Yankee Stadium, is all going to be public. The public is paying a good chunk for building new parking garages for the Yankees, including one that will be used by the players and VIPs and various folks like that. And the team is getting all sorts of different tax breaks. As Bettina mentioned, they're not going to be paying property taxes. They're going to be getting mortgage-recording taxes. They're going to be getting these tax-exempt bonds that we've been talking about, which is actually a tremendous amount of money, if they get the new $300 million in bonds they're looking for. They're going to be talking about getting more than $300 million worth of tax breaks just on the bonds themselves. So when you add it all up, you get somewhere around $900 million worth of public money that's being spent just on Yankee Stadium. JUAN GONZALEZ : Bettina, those who advocate these stadiums say, \"Why not? This is economic development. It's creating jobs. It's keeping a sort of a -- the psychology of the city by having a professional sports team that the residents can root for.\" What's wrong with it? BETTINA DAMIANI : All the subsidies that Neil just listed. You would like to assume that the city and the state made a clear path to making sure that there were going to be jobs, good-paying jobs for New Yorkers, on the other end. That was going to be the investment, right? We see nothing. There's nothing that says a certain number of jobs has to be set aside for either local New York residents or local Bronx residents, or the number of jobs at all. The city has really washed their hands of making sure there's any accountability on jobs and clear benefits for New Yorkers on the other side of this project, which is very unfortunate. I mean, we're grateful for Congressman Kucinich and Assembly member Brodsky to get involved in this issue. Neither represent New York City, by the way. New York City elected officials - they're filling a void, because local elected officials in New York City have refused to get involved in this project. And we need them. We need them to make sure that the promises in the press releases actually turn out to be something that we can hold them accountable for. JUAN GONZALEZ : And you have, generally speaking, on this issue of tax-exempt financing for economic development, raised numerous questions over the years. It's been one of my favorite topics, how cities are siphoning off their tax bases to create special deals for developers, whether it's sports teams or private companies, where they're, in essence, siphoning off the existing tax base from the municipal government and using it to fund special projects. How rampant is this, not only in New York, but throughout the country? BETTINA DAMIANI : It's a terrible issue regarding not only the issue of financing, but making sure that there are quality jobs for Americans and, in our case, New Yorkers. There's a thing called the economic war among the states, where it seems that so many municipalities and states are worried about fighting one another for the headquarters of a particular agency that they're willing to set aside basic fiscal commonsense and not making sure that there are real quality jobs on the ends of these big deals. Site consultants are prevalent throughout the country that have really manufactured this process, and they make it seem like if the Yankees didn't get their subsidy or if the New York Stock Exchange didn't get a subsidy, they were going to flee somewhere else, without taking into consideration or doing some real due diligence. Where were the Yankees going to go? The Yankees are famous because they're in the Bronx. We have a large media here. We have an incredible fan base here. And it seems none of that was taken in consideration before this huge giveaway was done. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, that's one of the things I think Assembly member Brodsky is trying to investigate, because the city agency that engineered this deal, the Industrial Development Authority, apparently said that the Yankees were threatening to leave New York, of course, the most expensive media market in the country, the most desirable media market in the country. Neil, your sense of whether that was real or not? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah, I mean, and I think everyone knows that the Yankees were not going to move out of New York City, and it's kind of been an open secret for decades now, as long as George Steinbrenner has been demanding a stadium. Where is he going to go? The Yankees are not worth the, whatever, billion dollars that they're worth if they move to Charlotte, North Carolina. But that was the pretense. And the Yankees actually told the judge in a case trying to stop the demolition of the parks, \"Well, if you try and hold up this case, the Yankees could move.\" And, you know, they've been allowed to get away with this. And as Bettina was saying, elected officials never challenged them on this, until, you know, recently Brodsky is trying - been trying to track it down. JUAN GONZALEZ : And, of course, the final irony of all of this is, in the new stadium, once it gets built, as with all these stadiums, the ticket prices for the average baseball fan go through the roof. The prices in Yankee Stadium for box seats now are astronomical -- they're astronomical now, but what they will cost in the new stadium is unbelievable. Could you talk about some of the prices that they've released so far? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah. I mean, they're talking over, you know, $1,000, $2,000 a seat for some of the really premium seats. And I think what you're going to see is -- JUAN GONZALEZ : For one game? NEIL DEMAUSE : For one game, yes. For one game, yes, absolutely. For a whole season, you know, all bets are off. But I think, you know, what you're going to see the Yankees do, they've promised to keep bleacher tickets low. They've promised to keep a certain number of, you know, $25-or-less seats. I think what you're going to see them do is, especially with Brodsky and everyone else paying attention to the soaring costs, I think you're going to see the Yankees keep ticket prices low for the first season or two and, you know, try to say, \"OK, we're holding the line.\" And then, as everybody's clamoring to get tickets, two, three years down the road, you'll see those start to creep up. So, what I'm worried about isn't, next year, is it going to be affordable, but three years from now, is anybody going to be able to get a ticket? JUAN GONZALEZ : Right. And then, of course, the final irony with - because most of these stadiums have luxury boxes that are for corporations that go from $500,000 to $800,000, in the case of the Yankees, per year to rent these boxes, and of course, my newspaper, the Daily News , reported yesterday that in this deal, the City of New York arranged to have its own luxury box at Yankee Stadium available, presumably to city officials, as part of the deal for the financing. Bettina, your response to that? BETTINA DAMIANI : It's aptly coined the landlord suite. And it's just another example of how local elected officials almost seem to be void of feeling that they have responsibility to the public, because they're going to get nice seats, in the long run.

And the team is getting all sorts of different tax breaks. As Bettina mentioned, they're not going to be paying property taxes. They're going to be getting mortgage-recording taxes. They're going to be getting these tax-exempt bonds that we've been talking about, which is actually a tremendous amount of money, if they get the new $300 million in bonds they're looking for. They're going to be talking about getting more than $300 million worth of tax breaks just on the bonds themselves. So when you add it all up, you get somewhere around $900 million worth of public money that's being spent just on Yankee Stadium. JUAN GONZALEZ : Bettina, those who advocate these stadiums say, \"Why not? This is economic development. It's creating jobs. It's keeping a sort of a -- the psychology of the city by having a professional sports team that the residents can root for.\" What's wrong with it? BETTINA DAMIANI : All the subsidies that Neil just listed. You would like to assume that the city and the state made a clear path to making sure that there were going to be jobs, good-paying jobs for New Yorkers, on the other end. That was going to be the investment, right? We see nothing. There's nothing that says a certain number of jobs has to be set aside for either local New York residents or local Bronx residents, or the number of jobs at all. The city has really washed their hands of making sure there's any accountability on jobs and clear benefits for New Yorkers on the other side of this project, which is very unfortunate. I mean, we're grateful for Congressman Kucinich and Assembly member Brodsky to get involved in this issue. Neither represent New York City, by the way. New York City elected officials - they're filling a void, because local elected officials in New York City have refused to get involved in this project. And we need them. We need them to make sure that the promises in the press releases actually turn out to be something that we can hold them accountable for. JUAN GONZALEZ : And you have, generally speaking, on this issue of tax-exempt financing for economic development, raised numerous questions over the years. It's been one of my favorite topics, how cities are siphoning off their tax bases to create special deals for developers, whether it's sports teams or private companies, where they're, in essence, siphoning off the existing tax base from the municipal government and using it to fund special projects. How rampant is this, not only in New York, but throughout the country? BETTINA DAMIANI : It's a terrible issue regarding not only the issue of financing, but making sure that there are quality jobs for Americans and, in our case, New Yorkers. There's a thing called the economic war among the states, where it seems that so many municipalities and states are worried about fighting one another for the headquarters of a particular agency that they're willing to set aside basic fiscal commonsense and not making sure that there are real quality jobs on the ends of these big deals. Site consultants are prevalent throughout the country that have really manufactured this process, and they make it seem like if the Yankees didn't get their subsidy or if the New York Stock Exchange didn't get a subsidy, they were going to flee somewhere else, without taking into consideration or doing some real due diligence. Where were the Yankees going to go? The Yankees are famous because they're in the Bronx. We have a large media here. We have an incredible fan base here. And it seems none of that was taken in consideration before this huge giveaway was done. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, that's one of the things I think Assembly member Brodsky is trying to investigate, because the city agency that engineered this deal, the Industrial Development Authority, apparently said that the Yankees were threatening to leave New York, of course, the most expensive media market in the country, the most desirable media market in the country. Neil, your sense of whether that was real or not? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah, I mean, and I think everyone knows that the Yankees were not going to move out of New York City, and it's kind of been an open secret for decades now, as long as George Steinbrenner has been demanding a stadium. Where is he going to go? The Yankees are not worth the, whatever, billion dollars that they're worth if they move to Charlotte, North Carolina. But that was the pretense. And the Yankees actually told the judge in a case trying to stop the demolition of the parks, \"Well, if you try and hold up this case, the Yankees could move.\" And, you know, they've been allowed to get away with this. And as Bettina was saying, elected officials never challenged them on this, until, you know, recently Brodsky is trying - been trying to track it down. JUAN GONZALEZ : And, of course, the final irony of all of this is, in the new stadium, once it gets built, as with all these stadiums, the ticket prices for the average baseball fan go through the roof. The prices in Yankee Stadium for box seats now are astronomical -- they're astronomical now, but what they will cost in the new stadium is unbelievable. Could you talk about some of the prices that they've released so far? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah. I mean, they're talking over, you know, $1,000, $2,000 a seat for some of the really premium seats. And I think what you're going to see is -- JUAN GONZALEZ : For one game? NEIL DEMAUSE : For one game, yes. For one game, yes, absolutely. For a whole season, you know, all bets are off. But I think, you know, what you're going to see the Yankees do, they've promised to keep bleacher tickets low. They've promised to keep a certain number of, you know, $25-or-less seats. I think what you're going to see them do is, especially with Brodsky and everyone else paying attention to the soaring costs, I think you're going to see the Yankees keep ticket prices low for the first season or two and, you know, try to say, \"OK, we're holding the line.\" And then, as everybody's clamoring to get tickets, two, three years down the road, you'll see those start to creep up. So, what I'm worried about isn't, next year, is it going to be affordable, but three years from now, is anybody going to be able to get a ticket? JUAN GONZALEZ : Right. And then, of course, the final irony with - because most of these stadiums have luxury boxes that are for corporations that go from $500,000 to $800,000, in the case of the Yankees, per year to rent these boxes, and of course, my newspaper, the Daily News , reported yesterday that in this deal, the City of New York arranged to have its own luxury box at Yankee Stadium available, presumably to city officials, as part of the deal for the financing. Bettina, your response to that? BETTINA DAMIANI : It's aptly coined the landlord suite. And it's just another example of how local elected officials almost seem to be void of feeling that they have responsibility to the public, because they're going to get nice seats, in the long run. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, I want to thank both of you for being with us, Bettina Damiani, the project director of Good Jobs New York, and Neil deMause, who's a writer and the author of Field of Schemes: How the Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money into Private Profit .\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : Bettina, those who advocate these stadiums say, \"Why not?

Could you talk about some of the prices that they've released so far? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah. I mean, they're talking over, you know, $1,000, $2,000 a seat for some of the really premium seats. And I think what you're going to see is -- JUAN GONZALEZ : For one game? NEIL DEMAUSE : For one game, yes. For one game, yes, absolutely. For a whole season, you know, all bets are off. But I think, you know, what you're going to see the Yankees do, they've promised to keep bleacher tickets low. They've promised to keep a certain number of, you know, $25-or-less seats. I think what you're going to see them do is, especially with Brodsky and everyone else paying attention to the soaring costs, I think you're going to see the Yankees keep ticket prices low for the first season or two and, you know, try to say, \"OK, we're holding the line.\" And then, as everybody's clamoring to get tickets, two, three years down the road, you'll see those start to creep up. So, what I'm worried about isn't, next year, is it going to be affordable, but three years from now, is anybody going to be able to get a ticket? JUAN GONZALEZ : Right. And then, of course, the final irony with - because most of these stadiums have luxury boxes that are for corporations that go from $500,000 to $800,000, in the case of the Yankees, per year to rent these boxes, and of course, my newspaper, the Daily News , reported yesterday that in this deal, the City of New York arranged to have its own luxury box at Yankee Stadium available, presumably to city officials, as part of the deal for the financing. Bettina, your response to that? BETTINA DAMIANI : It's aptly coined the landlord suite. And it's just another example of how local elected officials almost seem to be void of feeling that they have responsibility to the public, because they're going to get nice seats, in the long run. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, I want to thank both of you for being with us, Bettina Damiani, the project director of Good Jobs New York, and Neil deMause, who's a writer and the author of Field of Schemes: How the Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money into Private Profit .\n\nSite consultants are prevalent throughout the country that have really manufactured this process, and they make it seem like if the Yankees didn't get their subsidy or if the New York Stock Exchange didn't get a subsidy, they were going to flee somewhere else, without taking into consideration or doing some real due diligence. Where were the Yankees going to go? The Yankees are famous because they're in the Bronx. We have a large media here. We have an incredible fan base here. And it seems none of that was taken in consideration before this huge giveaway was done. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, that's one of the things I think Assembly member Brodsky is trying to investigate, because the city agency that engineered this deal, the Industrial Development Authority, apparently said that the Yankees were threatening to leave New York, of course, the most expensive media market in the country, the most desirable media market in the country. Neil, your sense of whether that was real or not? NEIL DEMAUSE : Yeah, I mean, and I think everyone knows that the Yankees were not going to move out of New York City, and it's kind of been an open secret for decades now, as long as George Steinbrenner has been demanding a stadium. Where is he going to go? The Yankees are not worth the, whatever, billion dollars that they're worth if they move to Charlotte, North Carolina. But that was the pretense. And the Yankees actually told the judge in a case trying to stop the demolition of the parks, \"Well, if you try and hold up this case, the Yankees could move.\" And, you know, they've been allowed to get away with this. And as Bettina was saying, elected officials never challenged them on this, until, you know, recently Brodsky is trying - been trying to track it down. JUAN GONZALEZ : And, of course, the final irony of all of this is, in the new stadium, once it gets built, as with all these stadiums, the ticket prices for the average baseball fan go through the roof.

La presentadora afirmó que el Holocausto \"no tuvo que ver con la raza\". Los comentarios se produjeron durante un debate sobre la decisión de una junta escolar del estado de Tennessee de prohibir la obra \"Maus\", una novela gráfica del reconocido autor Art Spiegelman, cuyos padres sobrevivieron al Holocausto.\n\nWhoopi Goldberg : \"El Holocausto no tuvo que ver con la raza\".\n\nSara Haines : \"No\".\n\nWhoopi Goldberg : \"No, no tuvo que ver con la raza\".\n\nJoy Behar : \"Consideraban a los judíos una raza diferente...\".\n\nWhoopi Goldberg : \"Pero no tuvo que ver con la raza. No tuvo motivaciones raciales\".\n\nJoy Behar : \"¿De qué se trató?\"\n\nWhoopi Goldberg : \"Se trató de la inhumanidad de los seres humanos hacia otros seres humanos\".\n\nGoldberg se disculpó el lunes en las redes sociales por sus palabras. La presentadora también habló sobre el tema durante el programa del martes de \"The View\", donde dijo: \"Mis palabras molestaron a mucha gente; nunca tuve esa intención. Ahora entiendo el porqué y estoy profundamente agradecida porque la información que me dieron me ayudó a comprender algunas cosas de manera diferente\".\n\nDemocracy Now! es una organización sin ánimo de lucro 501(c)3 dedicada a la producción de noticias.

      "text": "After the Whoopi Goldberg controversy has America's daytime TV show lost its way?\n\nThe ABC daytime show The View suspended Whoopi Goldberg for comments about the Holocaust but not everyone thinks the incident was handled well\n\nWedged between Let's Make A Deal and General Hospital in the US daytime TV ratings is the The View, a venerable, sometimes contentious forum for gossip, banter and political debate. To some, it's an inspired cultural phenomenon; to others a blundering mess. Sometimes both.\n\nEither way, it has been on since 1997 after being created by expert guest tear-inducer and news legend Barbara Walters around the premise of women of different generations - 'the ladies\" - debating headlines of the day.\n\nLast week, it - again - veered into contentious turf when Academy Award winner Whoopi Goldberg - a Black cast member since 2007 when Rosie O'Donnell stormed out after an explosive confrontation with co-host Elizabeth Hasselbeck about the Iraq war - voiced her opinion that the Holocaust was \"not about race\".\n\n\"This is white people doing it to white people, so y'all going to fight amongst yourselves,\" she continued after being challenged that it was precisely about race and ethnicity. The show's producers faded to mood music and cut to a commercial break.\n\nThe conversation had its own controversial origins: a recent decision by a school district in Tennessee to remove Art Spiegelman's Maus, the graphic novel about the Holocaust, from its curriculum.\n\nGoldberg provoked outcry from Jewish groups and others, proceeded to repeat her thoughts on late-night TV, subsequently apologized twice and was then handed a two-week unpaid suspension and advised by the ABC News president, Kim Godwin, \"to take time and reflect on the impact of her comments\" .\n\nIn one sense, last week's spat was the kind of hot interaction in which The View excels and it generated a slew of headlines and talking points. On the other hand, no one in their right mind wants a host accused of antisemitism and the headlines were largely the sort that any network head would prefer to avoid.\n\nBut The View has long been a source of trouble - both good and bad - and a huge national platform. In its original format, The View counted Walters, broadcast journalist Meredith Viera, lawyer Star Jones, TV host Debbie Matenopoulos and comedian Joy Behar among its number.\n\n\"We started with them because we liked them the best,\" recalled producer Bill Geddie in Ramin Setoodah's account of the show, Ladies Who Punch. \"A comedian in her fifties, a journalist mom in her forties, a professional lawyer in her thirties, and someone in her twenties.\"\n\nThree weeks into the show's start, Princess Diana was killed in a car crash. Debbie wept. \"By going all in on feelings, The View embodied a moment,\" Setoodah wrote.\n\nFive months on from that, the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke with its hot-button characters: a philandering president who claimed to be a feminist, a young woman, a vindictive friend in the form of Linda Tripp who Behar christened \"Mrs Ronald Macdonald\", and a devastated wife. \"The Europeans are laughing at us,\" Behar continued. \"You cannot bring a country down to its knees because a girl is on her knees.\"\n\nThe show quickly became a political go-to for its direct access to stay-at-home moms. \"The politicians want to go on the view because it gives them a national audience and also gives them access to the individual groups that watch the particular panels,\" political strategist Hank Sheinkopf told the Guardian.\n\nIn 2010, Barack Obama became the first sitting president to appear on this or any daytime chatshow. His successor appeared 18 times before he took office, including one in which he said his daughter was so pretty he might date her.\n\nFormer secretary of state Hillary Clinton used the show as a warm-up act for her 2008 and 2106 presidential runs. Most recently, last October, she warned \"the ladies\" that Donald Trump continued to perpetuate a 'full constitutional crisis\"\n\nBut in recent years, The View has slipped in the ratings.\n\nBarbara Walters retired, and the show took on a more contentious political edge when it hired Meghan McCain, daughter of the late center-right senator John McCain. She left last year, saying she had enjoyed her four years in what she described as an \"anthropological experiment in left-wing media\".\n\nMcCain wrote in a subsequent memoir, Bad Republican , that The View was a \"toxic\" workplace environment. She quit the show, she wrote, because she felt her colleagues mistreated her for having conservative views. \"As the country got worse under Trump, the treatment from Whoopi, Joy and some of the staff grew meaner and less forgiving.\n\n\"It felt like the co-hosts and staff only knew one Republican - me - and took out all their anger on me, even though I didn't even vote for Trump,\" McCain added.\n\nThe latest blow-up with Goldberg could have been better handled, many commentators believe. Sheinkopf says ABC's parent, Disney, could have taken Goldberg in the corporate jet to Poland \"to show what actually happened\" and to \"look at the information instead of shaming her in public\". Instead, the exchange has been left \"controversial and unresolved\".\n\nAccording to Chanda Prescod-Weinstein, an African American Jew and professor of theoretical physics who studies the history of race in science, the comments reflected a contextual disagreement. \"I think Whoopi Goldberg is wrong and the Holocaust was a genocide rooted in racialization. But I think we have a framework disagreement, and there's nothing antisemitic about her words.\"\n\nTo Maiysha Kai, lifestyle editor at theGrio.com , the exchange reflects \"the weird sort of comparative dialogs that aren't always as helpful as we intend to be\".\n\n\"I don't think Whoopi's intention was to be offensive, but I think there was an error in how it was responded to. This is a forum created for these women to have free speech and often very lively dialogue about certain things.\"\n\nShutting the conversation down, Kai says, came off as abrupt, especially after what Black progressives had witnessed for years with Meghan McCain on the same panel.\n\n\"I feel like we were deprived of a necessary dialogue and probably a really long-overdue one. If there's an education that needs to happen, which clearly there is, I don't think it's an education that she needs alone.\"\n\nThe show's remit is all about keeping a public conversation going: The View's epic, 25-years-and-running TV innovation that has centered the views and opinions of outspoken women.\n\nIn an exchange reported in Ladies Who Punch, Hillary Clinton had gone on the show the day Rosie O'Donnell roasted Donald Trump for his infidelities and money issues, beginning a long feud that made it into two presidential debates.\n\nClinton told Behar she was laughing so hard backstage she was worried she wouldn't make it on to the set. \"Every day we're in trouble on this show,\" Behar responded. Clinton expressed curiosity, wondering why that might happen. \"I don't know,\" Behar responded. \"We're just women.\""

      "text": "The View from inside: talk show gets introspective to debunk rumours\n\nAs is custom, the presenters of The View began their Monday show with a discussion of the weekend's hottest topics. Except this time, the hottest topic was them.\n\nLast week, it was announced that Joy Behar would be leaving the US daytime show after a 16-year tenure. The day after, rumours began circulating that the show's token conservative Elisabeth Hasselbeck was being fired because her opinions were unpopular with the audience. These changes also inspired some to posit that Barbara Walters, the show's co-creator and co-executive producer, would also be leaving.\n\nThat sort of shakeup would be an immense change for the all-female show, which has had the same cast since 2007, and has spawned imitators in the US and the UK.\n\nWalters walked out arm and arm with Hasselbeck on Monday before clarifying that the only person leaving is Behar, as previously announced.\n\nWalters made a point of praising Hasselbeck. \"The truth is, we love Elisabeth. I like her personally, and she's just a wonderful person,\" Walters said. \"But beyond that, we value and appreciate her point of view.\"\n\nHasselbeck helps give the show \"perspective and balance\", Walters said and added: \"We have no plans for Elisabeth to leave the show.\"\n\nAnonymous sources told Us Weekly that Hasselbeck was being fired because she was driving people away from the show.\n\nHasselbeck, who began her television career on the reality show Survivor, has been a co-host since 2003. She has been the show's token conservative voice during her 10-year stint.\n\nBefore denying the Hasselbeck rumors, the women discussed Behar's impending departure, offering well wishes and thanks, punctuated by intermittent audience laughter. Behar will continue on the show until her contract expires in August.\n\nBehar said: \"I don't like my jobs to last longer than my marriage,\" then read off a list of the top 10 \"reasons\" she was leaving the show (sample: ABC won't let her drink on the air \"like Hoda and Kathie Lee\").\n\nBehar, like Walters, has been on the show since it began. Rumors that Walters would also be leaving began to surface when Walters said over the weekend that she would be clarifying The View gossip on the show.\n\nAfter saying each host is free to leave the show when they want, Walters addressed the rumors of her departure in a roundabout fashion. \"Right now, the only person who can't leave the show is me,\" she said.\n\nWalters returned from a month and a half long medical absence on 4 March after suffering a head injury at the British ambassador's Washington DC residence during a January party. Her absence was then prolonged by a case of the chickenpox.\n\nThe View started in 1997 and has had the same cast since 2007, when Whoopi Goldberg and Sherri Shepherd joined. Previous hosts have included Rosie O'Donnell, Star Jones, Lisa Ling and Debbie Matenopoulos.\n\nThe show has won Daytime Emmys, the NAACP image award and multiple nominations for a People's Choice award."

      "text": "Barbara Walters' The View sign-off: a complete guide to the returning hosts\n\nWalters' former co-hosts are making an appearance on Thursday's episode to wave her off. Here's a reminder of who they are and, most importantly, what they argued about\n\nAfter five decades in television and nearly two on The View, Barbara Walters will retire on Friday - but not before a reunion of View hosts past and present. This could get real.\n\nLet's be honest, The View hosts haven't exactly been renowned for their camaraderie. In fact, they're known for the opposite - particularly during the 2006 season, when former hosts Rosie O'Donnell and Elisabeth Hasselbeck went head-to-head on a regular basis (which gave SNL endless material). And while I'm sure they'll all be on their best behavior to wave Barbara Walters off, there's still some history we need to cover.\n\nMatenopoulos, who was just 22 when she was hired, suffered the wrath of the press almost immediately after her debut thanks to her youthful perspective and upbeat persona (which was negatively interpreted as \"ditzy\"). Two seasons later, she was abruptly let go and replaced by Lisa Ling. Now she's married, pregnant, and writing a Greek cookbook.\n\nOne of the first hosts enlisted for the '97 Walters project, the even-keeled Vieira used her moderator role on The View as a springboard for a lucrative career in broadcasting, going on to host Today, Who Wants to be a Millionaire, and her own daytime talk series , scheduled to launch later this year. This is what happens when you can weigh in calmly on Hot Topics.\n\nAdmitting that her 2006 departure from The View was \"ugly\" after a falling-out with Walters, the loud and outspoken Jones has since made peace with the host, and actually returned as a guest in 2012. That's when she pointed out to viewers that she and host Sherri Shepherd were, in fact, two different black women.\n\n\"So what? Who cares?\" With only a phrase, Fred Armisen's impression of comedian Joy Behar nailed her persona: a woman with a lot to say, but who still won't go to the mattresses without a well-delivered one-liner. Having left on her own terms in 2013, the host admitted to Leno last year that she got in trouble while on the series for her outspokenness, but seriously, so what? Who cares?\n\nNow an investigative journalist (and fixture on OWN), Ling left The View at 26 to pursue life in the field. Considering the thoughtful and reserved Ling wasn't exactly a wave-maker on the daytime series (which isn't a bad thing), the former host admitted to Larry King recently that as a young cast member it was sometimes \"hard to get a word in edgeways\" - especially since she'd been brought up to respect her elders.\n\nRight wing, loud, Republican, right wing, confrontational, right wing: the Elisabeth Hasselbeck story. The former Survivor contestant sprung to prominence on the series through her fundamentalist Republican views, which have now found a place on the Fox News network, courtesy of Fox & Friends - a series that is by no means as jovial as it sounds.\n\nIt lasted only a season, but Rosie O'Donnell's stay on The View was not without controversy. Having left before her contract was even up, the comedian was the nemesis of conservative Hasselbeck, and following a major spat between them, she walked for good (until her guest spot in 2012). Here's hoping they're separated by enough former hosts on Thursday.\n\nWho was your favourite host on The View? Sound off in the comments below."

She later claimed to have endured a \"toxic work environment\".\n\nOn Monday, Politico reported that Behar, Goldberg and Hostin were \"upping the pressure to pick a successor, and voicing their displeasure at having to introduce new guest hosts ... in a seemingly endless process that they find disruptive\".\n\nThe website also said that while executives would not \"consider a Republican who is a denier of the 2020 election results, embraced the 6 January riots, or is seen as flirting too heavily with fringe conspiracy theories or the Maga [pro-Trump] wing of the GOP\", they also wanted a host with \"credibility with mainstream Republicans, many of whom still support Donald Trump\".\n\nPolitico said Ana Navarro, a Republican operative and frequent guest host , was not favoured because she was too close to the other hosts - and worked for Biden in 2020.\n\n\"They are really looking for a unicorn,\" one \"former show staffer\" was quoted as saying. \"They want someone who is going to fight - but not too hard, because they don't want it to be ugly and bickering.\"\n\nAn anonymous guest host was quoted as saying: \"The problem is that they bring people on under the mantle that 'this woman is a conservative' when they're 'Never Trump', so they don't represent the country.\"\n\nThe report prompted anger online.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" wrote Tom Nichols, a \"Never Trump\" conservative, academic and author . \"Why is being a 'Never Trumper' somehow disqualifying?\"\n\nMax Burns, a Democratic operative, wrote : \"It's increasingly impossible to find a prominent Republican voice willing to say the 6 January insurrection was wrong. That's scary for a lot of reasons beyond leaving The View short-staffed.\"\n\nAnother writer, Daniel Kibblesmith, went further : \"Maybe that's a sign that if ... the average Republican viewer is a fascist , there's no obligation to make sure those views continue to be broadcast to millions like we're all just friends who disagree with each other meeting in the middle.\"\n\nA spokesperson for The View said: \"Our plans are on track as we continue to look for the right person to join our panel of smart, dynamic women. We look forward to welcoming guest co-hosts for return appearances and introducing new names into the mix in the new year.\""

      "text": "Simon Amstell: 'I want to find new types of suffering'\n\nT here is a brilliantly awkward moment on the US talkshow The View, clipped on YouTube , where Simon Amstell tries to charm Joy Behar, the unconvinced 70-something host, with a bit from his show Numb. Amstell is explaining how conversation with his mum is always secondary to the fact that \"I came out of her vagina\". And that because she came out of Grandma's vagina and so on, it makes that relationship harder, too. \"It's like a Russian doll of awkwardness,\" he tells her. Behar finally laughs and tells him he's funny. \"So,\" he touches her arm. \"Have I broken America yet?\"\n\nWhich, his staged eagerness aside, is what Amstell has been working on for much of the last year: London, New York, LA and back again, gigging at tiny venues, popping up on Letterman and playing up the English eccentric . In the second (and final) series of Grandma's House last year, the career of \"the character\" Simon Amstell couldn't even get a gig presenting his aunt's local charity quiz; his only chance of going to America was as his semi-boyfriend's lackey. The non-sitcom Simon has just released his second standup DVD and has popped his head through a door to announce: \"I'm just going to cleanse my face!\"\n\nWe're meeting in the House of Wolf, a Victorian-themed \"multi-sensory pleasure palace\" in Islington, opened specially for us. It's the steampunk-lite fantasy of a pub; nooks, crannies, an apothecary and antlers fixed on rococo papered walls. Pictures are being taken when I arrive. After 10 minutes, we're sitting at a table and a makeup artist is, in fact, cleansing his face.\n\n\"Is this going to be one of those interviews where you say: 'He came in, wearing trousers ...'\"\n\n\" ... and a man came over and wiped his face. And then he laughed,\" I suggest.\n\nSimon Amstell does laugh, a lot. Big squawks when he thinks I've asked something ridiculous, stuttering gulps when he's laughing - sometimes nervously - at his own jokes.\n\nSo ... is he breaking America?\n\n\"I don't know if I am. I'm just sort of going there and doing very small shows and quite enjoying being new I suppose.\" It seems a fairly relaxed plan for such a major endeavour. \"How do I phrase this ... The show Numb, the place that I come to after various stories involving bits of pain and trauma, is joy. I'm only interested in being in the moment containing joy. So it's difficult to know where ambition, where does that fit into that?\" He is near embarrassed by the craven nature of it, despite the fact that he quit two shows - Popworld (2001-2006) and Never Mind the Buzzcocks (2006-2009) - before we could get bored with him, going off to do bigger and more ambitious things each time.\n\n\"What I decided was, I sort of wanted this stuff since I was a weird 13-year-old child and I don't still want to be that. For 20 years to go by, and still be the same insanely driven, ambitious, peculiar child is too annoying a thing for me.\" He performs his next line. \"That kid's parents have just divorced, he had some issues to deal with and dealt with it by juggling, and having people look at him do things like that. I sort of feel now, being funny is my only real ambition. Everything else seems like vanity.\" He nods. \"I've finally done a soundbite for you at the end.\"\n\nIt's the first of several clumsy meta-breaks he takes to analyse how the interview is going. It must be catching - we out-awkward each other for some 30 minutes before we end up checklisting the three tropes of a Simon Amstell interview: mentions of his hair (usually wet, shower-fresh); his frequent, high-pitched laugh (a sort of reverse Nelson Muntz ); and the now obvious observation that his comedy acts as a form of personal therapy.\n\n\"I was very ethical about interviews, I never became friends with pop stars.\"\n\n\"Because you'd make them hate you?\"\n\n\"Ahaha! I thought it was very important never to have any sexual relationship with anyone so you couldn't fawn on them.\" Uncertain about how this all might play on the page, he then yelps: \"You can fawn if you want to, though! Feel free ... oh no. I shouldn't have said that.\"\n\nHe shouldn't have, because it makes it more difficult to suggest that his talent (considerable) and irregularly wired brain makes him the closest Britain has to Larry David. Or, as a New York Times review suggested over the summer , a young Woody Allen. Last Friday, Amstell landed a spectacularly uncomfortable - and funny - gag at the expense of Nick Grimshaw's breakfast show, claiming that \"Mandela would not approve\" of the apparent segregation between Radio 1 and 1Xtra staff. Horrified overreaction followed. But Amstell, of course, made his career in mining uncomfortable truths. As a pop presenter, he would gleefully roast his interviewees and tip audiences into face-clawing tension, making you wonder how close he ever came to being punched in the face. (His nerve was breathtaking, though; the Preston walk-off on Buzzcocks still holds up to repeated viewing.) But later, by the time he was selling out theatres for his live shows, that gawky guile and snotty cheek had morphed into relentless anxiety and slapstick self-consciousness. It's now as much his thing as his constant dissection of social norms and reflexively asking, well, \"is this a thing?\"\n\n\"I don't understand why anyone wonders whether [performing to US audiences] would be all right or not. I don't talk about things that are particularly English.\" There's the tiniest sigh. \"I talk about a universal despair, the pains of being a human being, I talk about a breakup. I talk about my father. I'm not talking about going to Sainsbury's and eating a pie.\"\n\nTrue, it's not anathema to see a self-conscious, neurotic, Jewish comedian on a US stage and, in a way, the delivery of lines like \"there is something in me that wants to fuck [Justin Bieber] until he cries\" beg for a HBO special. Plus, there's the very American self-help he sneaks in the show: from the journey he's made - not away from drink or drugs addiction as per Russell Brand (although, unrelated, Amstell is teetotal) - but his gauche, more anxious self.\n\n\"A lot of what it comes down to is drinking ayahuasca in Peru.\" There is a whole routine on this shamanistic healing experience in Numb, where he probes why sex, drugs, food, drink and religion are used to squash feelings rather than deal with them.\n\n\"Before I left, I felt broken. After I came back, I didn't feel broken any more. It's not the sort of thing I thought I'd be able to talk about in standup comedy. If a comedy character had done it, it would be a hippy caricature. But that thing that happened in a rainforest was the most real thing that has happened to me.\" He tells me about the routine of appointments he used to keep in substitute: therapy, osteopath, acupuncture, yoga. \"My root position used to be 'I'm broken. I need to do a lot of things to make sure I'm ok.' But say the word 'shaman' here and you will look like a maniac.\" An incredulous HA! follows. \"People will say, 'Please don't go talk to a shaman, stay here, with me, and have a drink and a lovely line of cocaine and you'll be fine. Please don't talk to a shaman.\"\n\nConsciously or not, Amstell's performed angst has helped usher in the most curious trend in contemporary British standup: the age of anxious young men. Where John Osborne had kitchen-sink grit and revolutionised drama, we now have a generation of young male comics celebrating being socially inept live on stage: Jon Richardson , Josh Widdicombe , Carl Donnelly , Seann Walsh , Liam Williams , Bo Burnham and so on. As different as they are from each other and Amstell's own sub-philosophical strand of standup, the running gag here seems to be that it's funnier to reveal a vulnerable inner monologue than it is to swagger on, cocksure, with a stockpile of one-liners. Amstell looks either suspicious or unsure, as if I've poked holes in his authenticity.\n\n\"I think, what tends to be happening is that I experience something, either painful or just curious and then sort of dig away at that thing or myself until I've resolved it through either writing about it, or performing it.\" There's a stock-taking pause. \"I read an interview with Mike Skinner years ago where he said, 'You can't just decide you're going to write a song about something, the song that comes up is the song that comes up.' Then, two things happen. One: you can go, 'Right. That's Who I Am. That will be profitable and make me famous and I will stick to that.' Or, you can say 'I'm Rejecting Any Of Those Ideas Of Who I Am. I didn't come to that material with those labels and those labels aren't going to tell me anything new about myself.'\"\n\nWhich is the long way of saying he isn't interested in where he fits. \"It's not my job to be the cultural historian of my own work, I don't see much standup on television and I don't watch much unless there are people I love and go and see.\"\n\nWe talk about his obsession with being in the joy of the moment (a difficult concept, he admits on stage, if you're vegan). \"It's probably easier to be in the moment on drink or drugs, it's a hazier moment. It's a different kind of being in the moment - there is a freedom and a joy to magic mushrooms that is difficult to achieve without them.\" At this point, an eavesdropping BBC PR comes in and tries to sit in on the rest of the interview. \"That is in the show,\" Amstell explains to her, about the mushrooms, when she is politely asked to leave. \"I'm a standup comedian,\" he says, deliberately earnest. \"I think it's fine.\"\n\nAnd he is. Pretty much. He saw Diane Keaton act, in real life, while visiting a film shoot in New York a few weeks ago (\"When someone is that funny, it looks like an accident\") and he's been watching Buddhist monks on YouTube. (\"How are they able to just sit and talk slowly? How are you talking so slowly, Monk?! HA.\") Recently, he found himself laughing out loud throughout the Mark Rylance production of Twelfth Night on Broadway. \"I'm an idiot from Essex ... and those jokes are old. But there's a profound feeling of connection for those moments when you're thinking: 'What is the point in carrying on?' There is joy in this.\" He's almost running the risk of being happy and comfortable in his skin, I suggest.\n\n\"Oh, there will also be suffering because we're alive. So that's that. That's done and fine. And I don't want the same problems as I had last week because I'll write the same jokes. I want new types of suffering.\" Which does make you wonder what shape Simon 3.0 might take."

      "text": "Donald Trump Jr wants to trigger and expose liberals, and they're letting him\n\nA war of words on The View showed the president's opponents falling straight into his son's trap\n\nL ast night, ABC's The View invited Donald Trump Jr on as a guest - because having just one child of a famous politician on the show is not enough (the co-host Meghan McCain is the daughter of the late senator John McCain). They also invited Trump Jr's girlfriend - because in today's political landscape, even the most tenuous link to fame or power seems as good a credential as any for being worthy of a platform.\n\nIt wasn't long before the chatshow descended into chaos. Soon, McCain and Trump Jr were in a very contentious battle over whose dad was bigger than whose - McCain pointing out that Trump said mean things about her dad; Trump Jr pointing out that his dad had Made America Great Again.\n\n\"My father.\" \"Yeah, well, my dad.\" \"Interesting, but my father.\" \"True, but also my dad.\" pic.twitter.com/d0Fk1ulTxq\n\nIt was low blows from then on, thrown from all sides. A discussion started about how President Trump has stooped to lower levels of moral decency than any other president, for example, by boasting about sexually assaulting women and calling Mexicans rapists .\n\nIf the title of Trump Jr's new book is anything to go by ( Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us) , to start a fight over political correctness was probably his aim. And that is exactly what happened.\n\nIf we're going to talk about bringing down the discourse, Trump Jr retorted, perhaps we should talk about the time that Joy Behar - another host on the show - wore blackface. (In 2016, Behar joked about her \"costume\" on TV, saying she was dressed as a \"beautiful African woman\" and admitted to darkening her skin). And what about the time that the co-host Whoopi Goldberg, he continued, invented the term \"not rape-rape\" to describe Roman Polanski's alleged drugging and rape of a 13-year-old child?\n\nThe ensuing pile-on must have been music to his ears: throughout the show, the hosts talked over him a number of times; at one point Behar chastised the audience for cheering him (\"this isn't a Maga rally!\" she said).\n\nThis all made for perfectly predictable viral content: people shared videos of Trump Jr calling the two out. \"Guess you could say I just #Triggered The View!!\" exclaimed Trump Jr online.\n\nI don't think I've enjoyed an interview this much in my life. Guess you could say that I just #Triggered The View!!! https://t.co/K0zMTij3Pw\n\nThe irony of a man justifying his father's alleged sexual assaults by talking about his accomplishments, then criticizing Goldberg for defending Polanski is not lost on me. But if the point of his book is to suggest that cancel culture and no-platforming are examples of the unforgiving, righteous nature of the left, then here it is.\n\nThe hosts found themselves in a double bind. If Behar and Goldberg were to defend themselves, what could they say? That it was a different time? That they have changed? Trump Jr would just ask for equal forgiveness for his father. If they don't have an answer to his attacks, the implicit question stands: shouldn't Behar and Goldberg be cancelled already?\n\nNeither Behar nor Goldberg have ever fully apologized, and Goldberg has used her platform to make excuses for her friend Mel Gibson, who was caught on tape spewing racist comments . Clearly, they are flawed. But no one - not even people on the left - is born with fully formed progressive views.\n\nPeople make mistakes. That doesn't mean we should shrug and say we therefore shouldn't aspire to any moral compass - which is what it seems Trump Jr is trying to do. Nor does it excuse Behar, Goldberg or Trump Jr - they clearly each need to reflect on their own positions, perhaps privately - before subjecting us to this on live TV. But it does mean that progressives are sometimes too eager to call for people's heads.\n\nAs for the rest of us? We should be triggered by a president who locks children in cages, and who equates leftwing protest with \"alt-right\" hate crimes. He is the president: we have a right to criticize harmful policy. Plus, we couldn't cancel him even if we tried. But we need to stop making it so easy for him to get to us. His fans will be brimming with glee at his son's performance."

      "text": "Barbara Walters' The View sign-off: a complete guide to the returning hosts\n\nWalters' former co-hosts are making an appearance on Thursday's episode to wave her off. Here's a reminder of who they are and, most importantly, what they argued about\n\nAfter five decades in television and nearly two on The View, Barbara Walters will retire on Friday - but not before a reunion of View hosts past and present. This could get real.\n\nLet's be honest, The View hosts haven't exactly been renowned for their camaraderie. In fact, they're known for the opposite - particularly during the 2006 season, when former hosts Rosie O'Donnell and Elisabeth Hasselbeck went head-to-head on a regular basis (which gave SNL endless material). And while I'm sure they'll all be on their best behavior to wave Barbara Walters off, there's still some history we need to cover.\n\nMatenopoulos, who was just 22 when she was hired, suffered the wrath of the press almost immediately after her debut thanks to her youthful perspective and upbeat persona (which was negatively interpreted as \"ditzy\"). Two seasons later, she was abruptly let go and replaced by Lisa Ling. Now she's married, pregnant, and writing a Greek cookbook.\n\nOne of the first hosts enlisted for the '97 Walters project, the even-keeled Vieira used her moderator role on The View as a springboard for a lucrative career in broadcasting, going on to host Today, Who Wants to be a Millionaire, and her own daytime talk series , scheduled to launch later this year. This is what happens when you can weigh in calmly on Hot Topics.\n\nAdmitting that her 2006 departure from The View was \"ugly\" after a falling-out with Walters, the loud and outspoken Jones has since made peace with the host, and actually returned as a guest in 2012. That's when she pointed out to viewers that she and host Sherri Shepherd were, in fact, two different black women.\n\n\"So what? Who cares?\" With only a phrase, Fred Armisen's impression of comedian Joy Behar nailed her persona: a woman with a lot to say, but who still won't go to the mattresses without a well-delivered one-liner. Having left on her own terms in 2013, the host admitted to Leno last year that she got in trouble while on the series for her outspokenness, but seriously, so what? Who cares?\n\nNow an investigative journalist (and fixture on OWN), Ling left The View at 26 to pursue life in the field. Considering the thoughtful and reserved Ling wasn't exactly a wave-maker on the daytime series (which isn't a bad thing), the former host admitted to Larry King recently that as a young cast member it was sometimes \"hard to get a word in edgeways\" - especially since she'd been brought up to respect her elders.\n\nRight wing, loud, Republican, right wing, confrontational, right wing: the Elisabeth Hasselbeck story. The former Survivor contestant sprung to prominence on the series through her fundamentalist Republican views, which have now found a place on the Fox News network, courtesy of Fox & Friends - a series that is by no means as jovial as it sounds.\n\nIt lasted only a season, but Rosie O'Donnell's stay on The View was not without controversy. Having left before her contract was even up, the comedian was the nemesis of conservative Hasselbeck, and following a major spat between them, she walked for good (until her guest spot in 2012). Here's hoping they're separated by enough former hosts on Thursday.\n\nWho was your favourite host on The View? Sound off in the comments below."

I asked Rosie, she wasn't available for some reason.\"\n\nBehar is referring to the show, which premieres tonight at 9PM, a \"variety talk show\" and while she's known for her liberal political perspective on \"The View,\" she does not plan for \"The Joy Behar Show\" to be an overtly political show.\n\n\"You can see a lot of politics on a lot of different channels,\" Behar said. \"I'm not interested, really, in talking in some wonky conversation about politics, though.

      "text": "Joy Behar's Salty 'Sidepiece' Quip During Marriage Debate On 'The View' Sparks A Big Question\n\nSenior Reporter, Life Trends\n\n\"The View\" co-hosts recently engaged in quite the lively discussion about marriage, with one particularly intriguing question: Is it ever OK to suddenly request a nonromantic partnership from your spouse? Co-host Joy Behar doesn't think so.\n\nDuring a segment of the daytime show on Wednesday, moderator Whoopi Goldberg kicked off the topic by sharing a story from an online forum in which a woman said her husband of six years had suddenly told her that he was no longer interested in a romantic relationship with her. The author of the post also noted that her husband wanted to remain married and still live with her.\n\nBehar quickly suspected that there was much more behind the story.\n\n\"I mean, the guy either has a sidepiece, or he's in the closet or something ... or he's acting out somehow,\" she said. \"What man turns down sex - very few.\"\n\n\"He's asking for a roommate,\" co-host Sunny Hostin chimed in, as the panel debated what might be behind the husband's request.\n\nBehar then called the husband a \"loser\" for potentially causing harm to his wife's self-esteem because he \"doesn't even want to kiss her,\" she said.\n\n\"Maybe he has ED [erectile dysfunction] and doesn't want to admit it,\" Behar later scoffed. (Check out a video clip of the segment below.)\n\nBut Monica Cwynar , a licensed clinical social worker with Thriveworks in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania - who specializes in relationship issues, stress and major life transitions - said that the idea of a nonromantic marriage is actually \"an emerging trend.\"\n\n\"I've encountered several nonromantic arrangements in my practice,\" she said. \"One partner may feel content with the emotional aspects of their relationship, while the other may yearn for more physical intimacy, leading to a disconnect.\"\n\nCwynar said that the discussion on \"The View\" is reflective of some of the experiences she's encountered in her practice, which often highlight \"the complexities of love, desire and fulfillment in relationships, where partners might struggle to balance emotional closeness with physical needs.\"\n\nRead on to hear more on what you should know about nonromantic marriages and things couples should consider about this approach.\n\nCwynar thinks that a transition to a nonromantic marriage can have its challenges.\n\n\"If both partners agree to it and acknowledge their emotional and physical needs, it can work,\" she said. \"However, it requires ongoing dialogue and compromise.\"\n\nAnd as for whether a nonromantic marriage is grounds for separation, Cwynar said it all depends on the couple's \"unique circumstances.\"\n\n\"For individuals who feel content in the marriage overall but are missing physical intimacy, it's important to consider how that might impact that contentment long term and if what seeking it elsewhere will do to the relationship,\" she said. \"If both partners can maintain emotional support while addressing their needs, staying together is certainly viable.\"\n\n\"However, if one partner feels neglected or dissatisfied, separation might be a healthier choice,\" she continued.\n\nCwynar said that daily stressors , such as work, parenting and other responsibilities, can often \"divert attention from nurturing romance,\" which can lead to emotional and physical distance.\n\nShe also added that complacency, communication gaps and changes in priorities can affect a couple's romantic connection.\n\n\"As individuals evolve, their desires may change, leading to mismatched expectations if partners do not adapt together,\" she said.\n\nFor couples looking for ways to improve the romance in their relationship, Cwynar recommends trying different methods, such as having intentional date nights, doing spontaneous surprises or gestures that can help \"reignite excitement,\" displaying physical affection and making efforts to engage in shared interests or hobbies, among other things.\n\n\"Some of the signs that the romantic element of a relationship is gone for good is when physical intimacy is completely absent and partners do not even engage in affectionate behaviors; when conversations become superficial and partners feel more like roommates and the manifestation of resentment,\" Cwynar said.\n\nShe explained that while a nonromantic marriage may work for some couples, she advises that couples approach that arrangement with thoughtful and clear communication.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Joy Behar -- Standing Up Laughing\n\nCelebrity/Entertainment Journalist, www.twitter.com/@pat_gallagher\n\nJoy Behar is leaving The View . Maybe you heard. One of two original co-hosts left standing, Behar has no second thoughts about parting ways with the couch she has occupied since 1997 with Barbara Walters and the various other co-hosts who have come and gone over the years. The talk show host/stand-up comedienne has had quite the run on the daytime talk show -- 16 years -- and now it's time for 'Joy.'\n\nBehar spent some time with The Huffington Post to talk about her first love: stand-up comedy; the lean years -- life before The View ; what she's doing next... and she told us who she had to apologize to on air that pissed her off.\n\nIf you're almost 40 and you want to pursue a career that is 180 degrees from your current job, if you need to overcome fear of failure or you want to be a stand-up comedian when you grow up, you'll love this interview.\n\nYou're leaving The View . Say it ain't so because you may just be my favorite host on the show. Please don't tell the others I said that! (Laughs) That's so sweet. You know people stop me and say they'll miss me, but I've been there for 16 years, and it's like 'enough already!'\n\nDid you wake up from a bad dream and just decide you wanted to leave the show?\n\nNo, I just wanted to change things around. I've been doing these talk shows forever and sitting with other women where I'm a member of a panel, but then I got my own show twice: my HLN show and my show on Current TV where I'm the host of my own show, and I really like that better. So if I get another one where I am the host, then I will probably take it. But if I don't, then I will pursue other avenues. You know I started out as a stand-up comic.\n\nYes, I remember seeing you years ago doing stand-up on TV. I thought you were hilarious, and then you kind of just disappeared until I saw you on The View . Did you stop doing stand-up?\n\nI'm not sure which shows you're thinking of. I was on Merv Griffin one time, and I also did The Steve Allen Comedy Hour back in the early, early 80s. I got those gigs and then you had to work your way into the industry more. Steve Allen was particularly good to me. He discovered me as a comedienne when I was working as a receptionist at Good Morning America .\n\nHow did he discover you when you were working as a receptionist? Now that's a stroke of luck!\n\n(Laughs) Well, first of all, I was a high school English teacher. But I wanted to get into television production, and the only way you get into a show is to start somewhere. So I started as a receptionist. And then they offered me a producer's job, and I wasn't interested. I really wanted to do my comedy. One day I was asked to substitute for one of the writers on the show. I called up Steve Allen to find out his New Year's resolution. And I called up Frank Zappa. Both of them were very interesting but Steve Allen was particularly lively and great on the phone, and I actually made him laugh. He said to me, 'You know what? You're too funny for that job.' And I said, 'Well, I'm a comedienne, and I want to start doing stand-up.' He said, 'Can you send me a tape?' It took me awhile to get the guts up to send him a tape but I finally did. When I spoke to him again, he said, 'I laughed out loud.'\n\nWhat tape did you send him?\n\nIt was an audio tape of me doing a character from my old neighborhood in Brooklyn of an Italian woman giving news in the neighborhood. It went like: 'Former bodyguard, Carmine Russo, has become a faith healer. There's not a cripple left in the neighborhood since Carmine has been pronouncing his miraculous words: 'Walk or I'll break both your legs.' And he said, 'If I had a show, I would put you on the show.' But I remained on GMA and moonlighted with my comedy. Then he had a show, and he put me on his show.\n\nHow did you get fired from GMA and were you upset? I was devastated, but I actually expected it. I wasn't really doing the job. I would take these long lunch hours and go see a shrink. (Laughs) I wasn't really paying attention. So they fired me.\n\nThen I was devastated by the fact that I was a single parent and had no money. My ex-husband was a professor and he didn't have any money, so none of us had money. And there I was almost 40 years old with a daughter so I just decided to throw my hat into the ring. I started to do standup as many places as I could. I really paid my dues. I was doing sets at $10, $20-a-set in the city to hone my act. I would go on jobs in New Jersey for 50 bucks that would take me into the depths of Jersey on the Turnpike. At that time, comedy was very popular so they were turning bowling alleys into comedy clubs. This is the kind of dues I was paying. It all worked out because I became good at what I was doing. I became a good stand-up. I made a very good living at it.\n\nAround 1987 I got a show on Lifetime called Way Off Broadway . I was the host. It was in the early stages of Lifetime, and they didn't keep me on the air even though we had incredible shows, and I had great guests. It was one of those experiences where you realize that TV is very difficult to stay on the air. I always say, 'You know what they say? The show must go off.' (Laughs)\n\nHow did Barbara Walters discover you for The View ? Barbara saw me at a benefit for Milton Berle at the Waldorf Astoria. I was doing stand-up. I had had a radio show already. I had a couple of TV things. I was getting popular. I had an HBO special in 1989. She didn't know who I was but she did see me there. She was curious about me. A few months later, she was casting for The View and my name came up. So that's how the whole thing kind of came together.\n\nDid you turn cartwheels when you got that gig?\n\nI was happy for the following reasons: It was in New York. I mean it wasn't like the most high-paying job. I would have done better in a sitcom, believe me. For the amount of time that you have to put into for these shows, it's relentless. It's every day. You really don't make the kind of money that you make on a sitcom. And I was sort of poised to get a sitcom at that point. I had been to L.A. a few times. I made a pilot in Los Angeles that didn't get picked up... stuff like that was happening. So this job I took because it was in New York City. It allowed me to be myself, which I enjoy -- be funny every day. Plus Barbara was an iconic figure so I thought this show would not be a dumb daytime show, so that's why I took it.\n\nYou recently said on the show 'I've had to apologize for things and I'm still pissed about it'. What were you talking about?\n\n(Laughs) I had to apologize when the Tiger Woods incident was going on and Rachel Uchitel was in the middle of it, and I made the joke: 'U-ka-tell she's a hooker.' Based on her name: U-chi-tel... get it? And I got a 'cease and desist' [letter] requesting an apology from Gloria Allred that Miss Uchitel was not a hooker. Well it was just a joke. I mean I didn't know what she really was so I apologized for that because otherwise I was going to be in the middle of some kind of a lawsuit I thought. And then, another time I called Sharron Angle a bitch. She was running these ads [in Nevada] against immigrants that were just horrifying to me. And I did say, 'Come to the Bronx, bitch, and we'll take care of you up there,' -- or something like that. And I had to apologize to her. My apology was so half-hearted that everybody could see through it. I was like: 'I apologize, my use of the word bitch distracted from the real issues of what she's doing in Nevada.' So that was the apology.\n\nAs a comedienne you say things that are funny about people because that's what you do. Do a lot of people take offense or not so many? No. You know what? I get away with a lot. I think people see that I don't have a mean streak except sometimes it gets right-winged politicians. I'm like Mother Teresa compared to, let's say, Bill Maher.\n\nOr Joan Rivers.\n\nI'm a little bit easier on people than they are maybe but I admire them for being that audacious. As I get older I get more audacious. And I will continue to be more and more because at this point, I always say: 'So what, who cares?'\n\nHow do you like it when Fred Armisen on SNL does his Joy Behar takeoff saying 'So what, who cares?' Funny?\n\nFred has been on The View a few times. I think it's quite funny. Armisen has captured my twitches and my attitude. Although I look forward to the day when I will be impersonated by a woman.\n\nAfter you leave The View , do you plan to do stand-up again?\n\nYes, I'm booked in May at the Morristown Playhouse in Jersey, and I'm booked in Tarrytown in the fall. I could be working as a stand-up quite a bit now but I want to take some time. I'm working on a couple of projects. I'm working on a play which I can't talk too much about. I'm also working on putting together a stand-up one-person type of show which has video and movies and a lot of pictures from what I've been through in the past 50 years.\n\nHow did you cope with bombing on stage in the beginning? It's traumatic. My theory about it is, when you're first starting it is very difficult. Let me break it into percentages. Let's say 33 1/3 percent of your act is material; another 33 1/3 is persona -- who you are on stage; and the other 33 1/3 percent is confidence. Those are the elements that are required of a stand-up. Now the one thing you may be really lacking in the beginning is confidence. When I got on stage for the first time, I had material and I had a persona, but I didn't have confidence. It was petrifying to be up there. I always say that people in the audience have clothes on and you're up there naked. So you have to have your jokes, your material clothe you in a way. You have to go out there with a helmet.\n\nHow do you build that confidence when you don't have it to begin with?\n\nThe only way that I was able to do it was because I was really on the balls of my ass. I had no money. I had no prospects. I had to put aside my fear and my ego and just plunge into this industry. As I said, I was at bowling alleys in New Jersey so even though they were awful, every time I got up -- and I was compelled to do it because I needed the money -- I learned something. And the more stage time I had, the better I got and the more confidence I got.\n\nAfter you made it big in the business, was there anyone from your past who you wanted to say to: 'How do you like me now?'\n\nOh, yes, of course. When I was in high school there was a teacher... in my senior year of high school, I wrote, produced, directed and emceed an entire senior frolic, and we made fun of the teachers, we made up songs, and this one teacher said to me: 'Well, anybody can make fun of the teachers! Big deal!' She destroyed me for about 10 years. There were many years I would think about her and how she slowed me down.\n\nPeople can mess with your mind. Yes, people can mess with your head so I was not confident at the time. When I was in my 20s there were very few women doing this. Joan Rivers was out there plugging away, and it looked very hard to do. And it is. It didn't occur to me that I could actually do it until I was older. I was always hilarious at parties.\n\nI enjoyed The Joy Behar Show on HLN. You had great guests and topics. What happened?\n\nThey changed it at some point. I had to start dealing with the Casey Anthony cases, all that bullshit. I hated it. I was like: I don't care about her. So that's what happened over there.\n\nHow are things different now with Joy Behar: Say Anything on Current TV in terms of creative control for you?\n\nOn Say Anything , I have total freedom to do whatever subject I want. I don't think I will ever have that again on television. Never mind who The View is thinking of replacing you with, who would be your top three candidates to fill your role?\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

The Saudi Regime Under Fire.\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nGlenn Greenwald hosts this week's episode, and is joined by Brazilian Worker's Party vice presidential candidate Manuela d'Ávila and journalist Sarah Aziza.\n\nA far-right government led by the authoritarian Congressman Jair Bolsanaro is highly likely to win the presidency in Brazil when the October 28 run-off is held. This week on Intercepted: Glenn Greenwald is host and he breaks down the rise of the most extreme right-wing candidate in the democratic world and explains why Brazil's young and fragile democracy leaves it far more susceptible to a return of military rule than the older and more established democracies of Europe and North America. Glenn is joined by the vice presidential candidate on the Worker's Party ticket running against Bolsonaro, Manuela d'Ávila, for a wide-ranging interview about Bolsonaro, the campaign she and the Worker's Party are running, and the severe dangers posed to Brazilian democracy. He asks d'Ávila whether the democratic institutions in place will be enough to guard against a president who advocates returning to military dictatorship, and they discuss the neoliberal economic crisis that is likely to come. Journalist Sarah Aziza gives an in-depth analysis of the alleged brutal murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi that has rocked the journalistic world and started a debate over the U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia. She breaks down the Saudi government's explanations of events in Khashoggi's disappearance, and gives the context of other disappeared and jailed Saudi critics at the hands of the government before, and after, Mohammad bin Salman seized and consolidated power in the Kingdom.\n\nRead our Complete Coverage\n\nTom Llamas : She's one of the most recognizable faces in the world.\n\nMelania Trump : No, I don't feel he insulted the Mexicans.

This is episode 70 of Intercepted.\n\nAnca Ulea : I'm in downtown Rio as thousands of people flooded the streets to protest Jair Bolsonaro - the far-right candidate for president. Bolsonaro's made comments belittling rape and calling the gender pay gap \"justified.\"\n\nLucia Newman : Others are more concerned about his overtly pro-military stance and his praise for Brazil's former military dictatorship. Bolsonaro has vowed to fight crime and violence with more violence which horrifies -\n\nGG : I'm speaking to you from Rio de Janeiro in Brazil where political events have left much of the world shocked, baffled, and even somewhat horrified by recent political events here in the country. And here in Brazil, a large segment of the population is all of those things in addition to being somewhat terrorized. And the reason for that is the remarkable political ascension of someone who has been on the fringes of Brazilian politics for three decades but now is about to take over the country with virtually unlimited power and his name is Jair Bolsonaro - who has been a far-right extremist serving in the Brazilian Congress, essentially without very many allies and without very many partners. In the 30 years of his being in Congress, he was able to pass virtually no bills. He was able to form almost no political alliances. He was essentially a cult-like figure who had a fanatical following in Rio de Janeiro that constantly sent him back every four years to Congress, but never had any impact on the national scene.\n\nTo the extent he was known during this time, it was for making highly inflammatory attention-grabbing comments - some of which have become now famous around the world. He once told a female colleague, for example, in Congress - a leftist member of the Congress - who accused him of supporting and defending the rapists of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil. He said to her, \"Don't worry. You're too ugly to deserve my rape.\" He said in a recent interview when asked how he would react if he learned that his son was gay in light of his numerous homophobic and virulently anti-gay comments over the year, he said, \"I would rather learn that my son died in a car accident than learned that he was gay.\" He's made all kinds of extraordinarily racist and misogynistic statements that have been substantive in nature, but so far outside of the mainstream of Brazilian politics that they never really had any kind of an impact.\n\nAnd what he was probably most known for - the views of his that have been most consistent - are his continuous comments praising, and heralding, and heaping all kinds of compliments on the military generals who in 1964 overthrew the democratically elected left-wing government of Brazil. And then proceeded to rule the country for twenty-one years, from 1964 until 1985, under a brutal, highly repressive military dictatorship that did things like round up dissidents and critics, torture its opponents, and even engage in summary execution of people who opposed them.\n\nAnd in 1985, when Brazil finally exited the military dictatorship - a military dictatorship incidentally which was supported centrally by the U.S. and the U.K. as part of the Cold War - it became virtually taboo in Brazil to speak well of the military dictatorship. Brazil sort of reached the consensus at the end of the 80s that democracy was the only viable course of politics. And in fact it became a crime to engage in apology or praise of the military dictatorship but that never stopped Jair Bolsonaro. For 30 years, he has continued to praise the dictatorship. He refuses to even recognize it as a coup. He instead has repeatedly described the 1964 coup as a noble attempt to save Brazil from communist dictatorship. He describes it, not as a coup, but as a defense of democracy. And has repeatedly said that Brazil was better off under military rule than it has been under the last 33 years of its democracy.\n\nAnd what's most remarkable is that the same Jair Bolsonaro is on the verge of taking over the entire political structure of Brazil. And that's important for a lot of different reasons beginning with the fact that Brazil is a huge country. It's the fifth most populous country on the planet with 210 million people, right behind the United States. It's the largest and most populous country in South America. It's the seventh biggest economy in the world and it has one of the hugest oil reserves of any nation on the planet. So the prospect of a country of this size, and this level of influence, and this importance on the global and economic scale being taken over by a figure this extreme is something that has captured the attention obviously not only of everybody who lives in Brazil but the international media, as well.\n\nJust to give a sense for how much power Bolsonaro has already acquired before even being elected president: The first round of Brazil's elections were held on October 7 th - so, about 12 days ago or 14 days ago - and Brazil has a similar system to France where all of the candidates running for president have a first vote and if nobody gets more than 50%, the top two candidates go on to a runoff. Which is how Emmanuel Macron, for example, became president of France defeating Marine Le Pen in the runoff.  In the first round, Jair Bolsonaro almost won the presidency without the need for a runoff. He ended up with just over 46.2%. His next nearest competitor was the former Mayor of San Paolo Fernando Haddad, who is a member of the Workers' Party - the same party that has won the last four presidential elections going back to 2002 when it elected and then re-elected Lula [da Silva] and then elected and re-elected Dilma Rousseff who ruled the country until 2014 when she was impeached. And Haddad finished with 29% so 17 points behind Bolsonaro. And polls since then have shown that if anything the margin between the two has increased. The last credible poll taken on Monday shows Bolsonaro with 59% of the likely vote and Haddad with 41%. So an 18% margin. It's almost certain that Bolsonaro will win the presidency when the election is held on October 28 th , something unimaginable a mere 1 year ago.\n\nBut not only that, in the first round of the voting, his party - which previously was so tiny that he was literally the only member of it in Congress - won 52 seats becoming the second largest party in the Federal Congress. The center of the Federal Congress basically got decimated and all of its support went to the far-right. So parties that are either members of either Bolsonaro's party or aligned with it or sympathetic to his ideology dominate the Federal Congress, which means that when he does win the presidency he's likely to have very little resistance within both the lower house of the Congress and the Senate.\n\nJust to give you a sense of how overwhelming this wave was, his son, Bolsonaro's son - Eduardo Bolsonaro who's been a longtime member of Congress from São Paulo - received well over a million votes and set a record for the most votes ever received by a candidate for Congress in Brazil. His other son Flávio, who was a state representative in Rio de Janeiro, was elected to the Federal Senate by an overwhelming margin. So he has a son in the lower house, a son in the Senate, and also a son who serves in Rio de Janeiro City Council, and an an ally of Bolsonaro's who nobody had ever heard of - who's even a little bit crazier and more extreme than he - out of nowhere is now the frontrunner to be the governor of Rio de Janeiro and this movement has taken over all levels of government from the north of Brazil to the south and everything in between.\n\nAnd the reason this is so alarming is because of who Bolsonaro is. He's often in the Western media described as Brazil's Trump, but this highly understates and even misleads for two really important reasons. He's really not comparable to Donald Trump. He's much more similar to Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte or even the Egyptian dictator General Sisi. For one unlike Trump, who occasionally says comments that are intended to troll and shock and that are racist misogynistic, but never really is able to translate them into action and doesn't really have a consistent ideology over the decades, Bolsonaro has spent 30 years developing a highly definable ideology that is far more extreme than anything Donald Trump has ever advocated, including a literal return of the military dictatorship. The only time he criticized the military dictatorship was to say that the mistake they made was to only torture people and not torture and then kill them all. He says they should have killed at least 30,000 more people including the right-wing president who was elected, Fernando Cardoso. So he's far more extreme than Trump in his ideology and much more important is the difference between the U.S. or countries in Europe that have far-right leaders on the one-hand and Brazil on the other.\n\nUnlike the U.S., Brazil is not a democracy that's 230 years old. It's only 33 years old and therefore it's institutions are highly weak and highly fragile to the extent that there is even a deep state - of the kind that we see in the U.S. posing limits on Donald Trump, and the CIA, and the military then in courts and the like - to the extent there's a deep state in Brazil, it's the Brazilian military from which Bolsonaro himself comes. He was an army captain during the military dictatorship - served in it. And the entire top level of the Brazilian military is supportive of Bolsonaro and won't provide any resistance. If anything they will help him in his most extreme vision.\n\nSo what has happened in Brazil? A country which over, in the last four elections, voted for a center-left party - the Workers' - and now suddenly is about to engage, in not a mild shift ideologically, but a radical shift: From the Workers' Party to one of the most extremist far-right candidates known in the democratic world if not the most extreme. Why has that happened?\n\nPart of the reason is that there are multiple crises. There's an economic crisis that has left millions of people unemployed. There's a crisis of public security where crime is rampant - 60,000 murders a year - the chances of a Rio de Janeiro City police officer dying is higher than the chances that a U.S. soldier would have been killed at the height of the Iraq war. And there's a political crisis as evidenced by the fight over impeachment and the corruption scandal that has engulfed the country and so the country has simply ceased to operate. And when that happens, when there is a failure on the part of the establishment this profound, people turn to whoever they perceive as being an enemy of that system, as someone who they perceive will burn it down regardless of what that person's ideology is and regardless of whether this outsider status is really accurate and in Bolsonaro's case, of course, it's not. He's been in Congress 30 years, but he's positioned himself and is perceived as an enemy of the system that people have come to hate and in this regard, there are a lot of lessons for what's happening in Brazil for the rest of the world.\n\nWe saw the same thing with Donald Trump's victory in the U.S., with the success of Brexit in the U.K., with the rise of right-wing parties in Eastern Europe, and now even in Western European countries where far-right movements were previously unthinkable - places like France and Germany and Sweden. And the lesson is: That when the establishment fails to serve the needs of a huge portion of the population eventually they will come to realize that - will direct all of their hatred toward that establishment, will decide they have nothing to lose, and will run into the arms of whoever is the most extreme demagogue, even if it's somebody with ideas as hateful, and ideologies as obviously dangerous and tyrannical as Jair Bolsonaro. And that's why I've been saying for a long time that until the Western establishment starts to reckon with their own failures, instead of blaming foreign villains, or blaming other people inside their own country, or calling people names, we're going to have a lot more Brexits, a lot more Donald Trumps,  a lot more Marine Le Pens, and a lot more Jair Bolsonaros - and probably worse ones to come.\n\n[Musical Interlude.]\n\nGG : My first guest to explore all of this - the real nature of Jair Bolsonaro, what's happening in Brazil and why - is Manuela d'Ávila, who is the vice presidential candidate running on the ticket with the Workers' Party Fernando Haddad against Bolsonaro. She's an extraordinarily interesting politician. She's only 37 years old, an outspoken feminist, a member of Brazil's Communist Party which has actually worked within the governing coalition of Brazil over the last 14 years that has not been communist, but center-left. She's had a remarkable trajectory: She was the youngest woman, or the youngest person, actually, ever elected to the City Council of Porto Alegre, a large city in southern Brazil. After that, she became a Federal Congresswoman and now serves in the State House of her state and she is definitely somebody that is widely regarded as a political star and someone who is highly informed obviously about events that are unfolding, so Congresswoman Manuela d'Ávila, welcome to Intercepted.\n\nManuela D'Ávila: [Translated from Portuguese.] It's a pleasure to speak to you, Glenn.\n\nGG : Many people around the world are asking what the true nature of the threat posed by Bolsonaro is. If he is like Donald Trump, somebody who says scary and outrageous things but is confined by democratic institutions from actually doing them,  or if he is more like the President of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, or even the Egyptian dictator general Sisi. If he were to win, do you believe Bolsonaro is capable of implementing the worse threats to democracy that he advocates?\n\nMd'Á : I believe it is a mixture of many bad things that have already happened in Brazil and all around the world, but it is also a sui generis thing. We have a research done during the election period about what he and his supporters are capable of when it comes to politics and in society in general. It is important to notice that we have in the second round of the elections candidates who use the verb 'slaughter' when talking about organizations of the left or even about people who should be arrested by our legislation, but in our country, there is no death penalty. Therefore, slaughter, which is a verb that we in Brazil use for animal sacrifice, is not a verb that could be used by of a judge.\n\nThis same magistrate has participated in an act of desecration of a plaque in honor of councilwoman Marielle Franco, who was brutally executed seven months ago. We had a set of scattered acts but all with the same ideological matrix, say, of persecution of women, especially very young women. One of them with a swastika drawn in the abdomen, and also with the persecution of some organizations, of young homosexuals.\n\nSo for me, I've known Jair Bolsonaro for eight years. I know that he is not someone who formulates his opinions intellectually, someone who means more than he is capable of expressing. And I think that it is absolutely feasible for us to imagine that his government would take many anti-democratic measures, and even more than that, that this government would be conniving with this kind of violence motivated mainly by hatred.\n\nGG : So this is exactly what I wanted to ask you about. I think there are a lot of people, especially outside of Brazil who aren't thinking enough about the fact that Brazilian democracy is only 33 years old. So I'd like to ask you whether you believe that its institutions are sufficiently strong to protect against a possible tyrant who explicitly advocates a return of military rule?\n\nMd'Á : I do not know if there is an accurate answer to that, Glenn. How could institutions be so strong to stand a president, in the event of his election by the popular vote, and who defines an undemocratic regime? It is a difficult thing to imagine. What I do know is that he flirts with all the worst practices of what has already happened in Brazil. He is a man who systematically challenges democracy, who exalts the military dictatorship that we had, who exalts the practice of torture and recently said in an interview that his bedside book are the memories of Brazil's greatest torturer. Therefore, it is hard to understand or even imagine that someone with these opinions could be democratically placed in the government of Brazil, but we are facing this scenario.\n\nHow would it be? I don't know.\n\nOur institutions have been solid since 89. Brazil is a country that has built an electoral justice that until the 2014 election had never been challenged. This is part of the possibility that we had of a democratic pact, this is even a singularity of Brazil when compared to other newly democratic nations in Latin America as a whole. But in 2014 we had the questioning of the result of the elections by the defeated candidate, Aécio Neves, and that set off a series of crisis.\n\nWell, our side even in the face of different interpretations of reality, even believing that the impeachment was a coup because there was no crime of responsibility, even if the imprisonment of President Lula was legally wrong, our effort was to value a democratic way out for the political and economic crisis that Brazil is experiencing. And it is not for nothing that even in the face of an impeachment with no crime of responsibility and an unjust imprisonment against the one who was the first in the polls, we are disputing the elections.\n\nOur effort, our belief, is in democracy and in these institutions that we have consecrated ourselves in the last 33 years, since 1980.\n\nGG : One really interesting aspect of this election is that Jair Bolsonaro, even after 30 years in Congress, admits that he knows very little about economic policy. And because of this tends to rely almost entirely on his economic guru, Paulo Guedes, who was trained in things like privatizations and neoliberalism at the notorious University of Chicago. What is your view of the significance of Bolsonaro's intention to use Guedes as this super powerful economic minister?\n\nMd'Á : I believe your question is revealing as we in this election in Brazil, we are not debating what really matters, because in choosing Paulo Guedes as his intellectual and economic guru, Bolsonaro reveals his project for the country. And it's a project that is uncompromising with national sovereignty and the riches of Brazil, something absolutely antagonistic to this idea that he sells of a nationalist and a patriot, because the life and school commitment of Paulo Guedes is just the opposite. It's the privatization of a set of elements that are strategic for the development of Brazil. It is the idea that it is possible to develop Brazil without valuing work.\n\nGG : I just wanted to ask about where we are with the election currently. As you obviously know, your ticket with Fernando Haddad of the Workers' Party lost in the first round to Bolsonaro by 17 points -- he finished with 46%, you finished with 29%. And current polls show that your ticket with Haddad is behind by a similar margin. The election is two weeks from today, so what does your ticket, Haddad and Manuela D'Ávila, what does it need to do to close this difference and defeat Bolsonaro?\n\nMd'Á : Firstly, we understand that in deciding to extend the election, that is, having a two-round system, the Brazilian people asked for more debate. We want Bolsonaro to participate in the debates and to present his projects to the Brazilian people in the second round. Because this is the election of lies. There is no discussion of projects. He did not participate in the debates. He is absent. He sends out a set of alarmist and fake news on social networks.\n\nWe have a very low response rate, not just in the High Court that removes profiles. For you to have an idea Glenn, in these last two days I was able to remove 73 false news about me that totaled almost 13 million views. And these 13 million people who visualized this will not have access to the truth because the existing legislation it does not include that the 292,000 people who shared these fake news have to share the repair of the lie and expose the truth to the public. So how can we overcome this?\n\nThe Brazilian people will not opt for someone who is against the rights of workers, for someone who defends the sale of Brazil and the sale of our assets that can guarantee a future of development for our country, or for someone who does not defend democracy and freedom.\n\nGG : So in the last four national elections Brazilians voted for a party of the center left which was PT. Lula was one of the most popular leaders in the world, he left office in 2010 with an 86% approval rating among Brazilians which is unheard of. But now, there is a large part of the population that is changing radically and moving to support not just the right-wing, but the extreme-right. How do you explain that? Is it just the fake news and the lies that are being spread by Bolsonaro or are there other causes?\n\nMd'Á : First, if Lula was a candidate and he was for a while, he might have won the election in the first round. This is what all the opinion polls show. He could be elected with ease because he represents a time in Brazil.\n\nSecond, I believe that lies are structured from a broad economic powerhouse. And my concern is not so much with the lies but with the ability they have to amplify them with technological tools that cost money, which cost a lot of money and then probably are not even declared money in the Brazilian electoral process, which represents something quite serious.\n\nThese lies that I'm referring to are not just rumors or gossip but a structured, organized and amplified network with an unimaginable speed that makes people decide based on these news. There is a lot of information, Glenn, some stories have already circulated in the Brazilian press and in The Intercept too,  reporting how this scheme functions -- the information technologies used by the candidacy of our opponent are a so-called hybrid war, that is, technologies that use war techniques even with the coordination of people who work in specific areas.\n\nAnd there is a third issue, which is certainly the background or the fertile ground for this terror, that is the serious economic crisis in Brazil and the deepening of this crisis by the Temer government. The parties related to Temer and those who are behind President Dilma's impeachment were swept away in the electoral process. They had a very irrelevant performance nationally. So what do the people want? The people seek alternatives to the 14 million unemployed, the 1 million and 200 thousand Brazilians who cook without cooking gas because they have no money to pay for it, and to the impoverishment population. In the state of Sao Paulo alone, we have 800,000 people living with 133 reais per month, that's almost a million people living with only this amount a month. So people see all this. They're bombarded with this hybrid war of false news and they make the decision of breaking away from all that. So they go for someone who will break with the system, when in reality he is the purest expression of it, that he will break with the old policy when in reality he is supported precisely by those who represent what's most backwards in Brazil.\n\nSo those are words of quick assimilation by a population that is truly in a state of rapid impoverishment in the last two years and that is bombarded by these false news. I expect that in the next few days, talking to people, showing them the cowardice and the incapacity of this man who is so brave when he has a gun in his hand but can't participate in the debates.\n\nIn addition to the differences we have when it comes to the economy, the role of the state, in national sovereignty, we also have a difference in what we dream of for Brazil. My Brazil is that of democracy and freedom, his Brazil is that of dictatorship and torture.\n\nGG : If you were to win, your ticket with Haddad, do you believe the Brazilian military will accept the results as valid or will they denounce it as fraud as Bolsonaro was encouraging them to do? On the other side, do you believe if Bolsonaro wins the Brazilian military will impose limits on him if he tries to attack the basic foundations of Brazilian democracy or will they be a voluntary and eager participant in that attack?\n\nMd'Á : Before formally becoming a candidate, when I was still in the status as precandidate for president and Haddad was also a pre-candidate, early in the year, we were both in separate meeting in which General Villas Bôas, the commander of the Armed Forces in Brazil talked to the presidential candidates, and I left with the conviction that the Armed Forces are committed to the democratic state of law and they know that they are subordinate to the president. So this is the interpretation I have of the conversation I had with General Villas Bôas, this is my impression.\n\nEven because all of us in Brazil know that Bolsonaro was expelled from the Armed Forces and therefore he does not represent them, although he wants to and he flirts with remnants of a period of military dictatorship. I am very much expecting that we will win the elections and that we will continue with this cycle that started in 1989. We will be following the federal constitution of 88 where the Armed Forces have an important role, I would say a strategic role for the sovereign and development of Brazil.\n\nThey work and they have the responsibility to protect our territory, to guarantee peace in Brazil and in our continent and I know that they can work with us on important projects related to the defense industry that is strategic so that Brazil can continue to grow. I know that in Brazil there is no tradition of intrigue and anti-nationalism in the Armed Forces, that's Bolsonaro's tradition. Bolsonaro does not stand for Brazil, so he contradicts the values of those he claims to represent because we -- I repeat, I do not know a military man who does not honor, who does not say, does not claim to honor the Brazilian flag and fight for the country's sovereignty.\n\nWhoever wants to hand over Brazil and give away our riches, he has no commitment with that flag.\n\nGG : Congresswoman d'Avila, I know that you're very immersed in this election, battling quite intensely and are very busy so I really appreciate once again you're taking the time out to speak with me today.\n\nMd'Á : Thank you, it was a pleasure to talk to you.\n\nGG : Manuela d'Avila is the candidate for vice president on the Workers' Party ticket. The voiceover in English was done by my colleague Bruna de Lara of The Intercept Brazil.\n\n[Musical Interlude.]\n\nGG : A major global controversy over the last 10 days has engulfed the Western media as well as the media in the Middle East relating to Saudi Arabia arising out of the October 2nd disappearance of Washington Post columnist and Saudi citizen Jamal Khashoggi, who entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey on that date in order to obtain documents he needed to marry his fiancée and never emerged again. Speculation immediately arose and has been sustained that his disappearance was either an attempted abduction or a murder by agents dispatched by the Saudi government. That was what the Turkish government has been saying since the event took place - insisting that they have audio and videotape proving that this occurred - though it has not yet been publicly released or heard.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, President Trump tweeted, \"Just spoke with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia who totally denied any knowledge of what took place in their Turkish Consulate. He was with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo...during the call, and told me that he has already started, and will rapidly expand, a full and complete investigation into this matter. Answers will be forthcoming shortly.\"\n\nOn Monday, it was reported by several media outlets that the Saudis, after first spending ten days denying any involvement in the disappearance of Khashoggi, are now prepared to say that in fact there were agents acting either at the behest of the central government or potentially rogue elements, who went there with the intention of interrogating him and somehow the interrogation went wrong and Khashoggi ended up being killed.\n\nTo discuss all of this with me including the potential repercussions, I am joined by Sarah Aziza. Sarah is a freelance journalist who covers foreign affairs, human rights, and gender. She wrote a recent feature for The Intercept titled \"Kingdom Crackdown: Saudi Women who Fought for the Right to Drive are Disappearing and Going into Exile.\" Sarah Aziza welcome to Intercepted.\n\nSarah Aziza : Thank you so much. I'm happy to be here.\n\nGG : So how would you assess - and obviously it's speculative since we don't know any details or even exactly what the Saudis intend to say - but how would you assess the likelihood that rogue agents acting independent of either Mohammed Bin Salman or the Saudi Security Services would carry out an operation of this magnitude against somebody so prominent.\n\nSA : Yeah, I find it incredibly hard to believe that rogue elements are to blame here. How unlikely it would be for them to get inside the Saudi consulate, to be aware of Jamal Khashoggi whereabouts, to have such a strong desire to see this man killed that they would attempt to do him harm on the Saudi consulate grounds. All of it seems very far-fetched. All of it seems even more unlikely considering such an excuse come so late in the game and was basically handed to the Saudis by Donald Trump.\n\nDonald J. Trump : The king firmly denied any knowledge of it. He didn't really know, maybe, I don't want to get into his mind but it sounded to me like maybe this could have been rogue killers. Who knows?\n\nSA : He is popularizing this phrase rogue actors so not only does it come a very late period in the investigation but it also seems like quite a stretch considering that Jamal Khashoggi also traveled and spoke widely in public in Turkey, in the U.S. that there would have been ample opportunity for someone who wished him ill to attack him outside of the confines of the Saudi consulate. The ignorance that the Saudi government has been pleading up until now doesn't really corroborate what they're saying.\n\nGG : Well, I'm going to explore with you a little bit potential motives of the Saudi government. You have somebody who is an extremely prominent and longtime journalists with ties to all kinds of prominent Western media and political figures. He was a columnist at the Washington Post. Whoever decided they were going to kill him had to anticipate what the repercussions would be. Why was he such a threat to factions inside of Saudi Arabia that it would be worth incurring this kind of a reaction?\n\nSA : Yeah, it seems extreme any way that you look at it honestly. If it turns out to be the case that the Saudi government intended to kill him this would be sort of one of the most bald-faced escapades undertaken as far as the Saudi government's reach beyond its borders. We've seen other activists and dissidents, or wayward princes, basically kidnapped while abroad, brought back to the kingdom, some of them not to be heard of from again. But nothing of this sort of grisly potentially violent, mysterious magnitude. So if the Saudi government did order his murder directly, I think what we'd have to look at is not only all of Jamal Khashoggi recent writings which have been openly critical of the of the Crown Prince but also the understanding that the Khashoggi had a lot of knowledge of the inner workings of the Saudi state and perhaps unflattering or incriminating information on powerful people and although he kept in his column strictly to arguing, sort of, on the more political line he didn't dip into blackmail or anything in any sort of public way. He might have made powerful people more nervous by virtue of the fact that he was a loyalist and insider in the kingdom for years and years. But at the same time, we have to consider that we're dealing with a Crown Prince, Mohammed Bin Salman or MbS who might be the most rogue as far as any of the characters we're discussing today.\n\nHe's been incredibly unpredictable volatile and at the same time consolidated power inside the kingdom to an unprecedented degree. So he's disrupted the former balance of power, which was more diffuse never diplomatic, but still diffuse and decided to take charge of the narrative surrounding his reign surrounding the new Saudi Arabia that he wants to present to the world.\n\nJamal Khashoggi was certainly one of the greatest threats to that narrative especially as someone from within the folds of the Saudi elite and that sort of criticism might simply have just been more than MbS felt able to bear. He's shown himself to be incredibly thin-skinned when it comes to criticism certainly when it comes from fellow Saudis. So perhaps we're seeing something totally new because we're dealing with a leader that is unlike any of his predecessors.\n\nGG : I guess part of what's leaving me a little bit baffled about all this is that even if you look at it from MbS' perspective and as you said he dislikes criticism particularly when coming from fellow Saudis, nonetheless you could write a thousand Washington Post columns critical of the Crown Prince by Khashoggi and it wouldn't be in the same universe in terms of the harm that it has caused to MbS' reputation that the belief that the Saudis are responsible for his grisly murder has generated. So the narrative in the West is a very simplistic one in terms of Khashoggi's relationship to the Saudis which is: He's a dissident; He's a critic of the crown. But you alluded to the fact that actually you know he's had insider status as well for a long time. Can you just describe a little bit what his trajectory has been in terms of his relationship to the ruling royal family?\n\nSA : He started off as an ambitious young journalist and really made a name for himself covering the war in Afghanistan. He was actually an acquaintance of Osama Bin Laden for a time. Interviewed him in Afghanistan during the war against the Soviets. Upon his return really established himself as a journalist in the kingdom and to do so required a sort of acquiescence, a sort of complicitness [sic] in the way things are done, which is that the media respected the boundaries and the reputations of the royal elite and the manner of doing things, which included balance of power between the business community, the religious community, and the royal family so -\n\nGG : So he operated as a Saudi journalist inside of Saudi Arabia, in a sense, with the approval of or at least without provoking the anger of Saudi rulers. He refrained from crossing lines if they had imposed in terms of the criticisms that you could voice he was somebody who was accepted and kind of interwoven into the Saudi political class. Is that pretty fair to say?\n\nSA : Exactly, yeah, he was very solidly in the mainstream for the most part. He made a few waves after 9/11 by calling out people who were circulating conspiracy theories who tried to shift the blame for 9/11 away from Islam and away from Saudi Arabia. He was a devout man who wanted to take responsibility for Islamic extremism which really concerned him. But he really started to receive some scrutiny from the Saudi government when he began publishing moderate columns and pieces in favor of the Arab Spring, when that was occurring in the region. He had a lot of hope and he started to promote this idea that Saudi Arabia was due for reform as well and always again within the language of reform. He was never a radical and never wanted to be called a dissident he saw himself as a journalist first and foremost. And he was comfortable making a certain number of compromises that were necessary to operate in the kingdom up until the emergence of MbS, during which time he told me in interviews the atmosphere really shifted. There was an increasing sense of censorship, a need for absolute loyalty and he eventually felt he could not practice journalism with integrity and really reluctantly and with a lot of regret decided it was no longer safe for him to be in the kingdom and he actually got out shortly before many of his colleagues were locked up by the Crown Prince.\n\nGG: So I want to ask you about a little bit of a theorizing that has been spread - some of which has been done so quite recklessly and with obviously ugly motives but others of which have been done a bit more responsibly and I think grounded in at least some reasonable knowledge of his history - which is that his view of democratization, or his tepid support as you alluded to of the Arab Spring, was a vision in which Muslim political factions, who would be tolerant and democratic  - whether it be the Muslim Brotherhood or other factions like - would become empowered through the democratic process. And that this as opposed to the columns he was writing for The Washington Post, namely his potential to be a kind of leader for a democratic uprising against the Saudi crown or otherwise reignite the some of the sentiments that animated the Arab Spring that obviously terrorized Gulf State dictators and the like, was really what the threat was that he posed to the Saudi ruling class. What is your view on all of those competing theories?\n\nSA : There have been some fairly credible reports that Khashoggi was planning on starting a few initiatives to promote democracy in the Middle East including an organization called Democracy in the Arab World Now. And those are the sort of perhaps more concrete initiatives or goals that would have certainly upset and angered the increasingly autocratic leadership in the entire region. We can't forget Saudi Arabia is not alone here in its move towards more dictatorial leadership styles or seeing similar things in the UAE and elsewhere. So I think that that's a plausible theory that it was these organizing efforts that really would have spurred the Saudi government to want to silence him. I know months and months ago speaking to dissidents and activists both in Saudi Arabia and abroad telling me that if there was ever going to be any kind of substantial move for change it was going to need to begin outside the borders of Saudi Arabia MbS had just so effectively shut out and frozen all the channels and even the will to resist by making it so dangerous by locking up so many people so widely and indiscriminately. So for someone to take a direct action, or a leadership, especially someone with the kind of influence - you know, Jamal Khashoggi was very well-connected beyond the kingdom's borders as well. So perhaps being able to garner political will from abroad and to zero in on some of Saudi Arabia's more egregious violations and practices would have really made him a target.\n\nGG : There has been a lot of people pointing out what seems to be the hypocrisy embedded in the anger of Western elites at Saudi Arabia as though they just suddenly discovered that the Saudis were repressive and autocratic and violent. And a lot of people are pointing out that in fact over the last several years the Saudis have been indiscriminately killing many civilians causing one of the world's worst, if not the worst, humanitarian catastrophes and for some reason that didn't trigger the anger of Western elites towards the Saudis or cause them to cancel events. At the same time, as obviously everybody knows, there's a huge amount of domestic repression inside of Saudi Arabia where Shiite religious leaders, or even people peacefully protesting, are imprisoned or killed and anyone critical of the Crown Prince is imprisoned as well. But what about targeting or even taking retaliatory steps against critics or dissidents outside of Saudi borders? Is this the first time that they've done something like this or are there other cases where they've shown that they will go after dissidents even if they're found in other countries?\n\nSA : Yeah, absolutely. Actually, I recently published a piece with The Intercept on this very topic. But there is, in short, a long legacy of Saudi Arabia reaching out beyond its borders and silencing, repatriating, arresting or kidnapping. You can choose your verb. The Saudis who displease, in some way, their government going back as far as the 70s when one activist - an early labor organizer who had been highly critical of the king - was disappeared from Lebanon. We've seen recently as the spring Loujain al-Hathloul - the prominent female rights activist who campaigned for the right to drive among other things - was kidnapped essentially. She was arrested and then forcibly brought back to Saudi Arabia from the UAE where she was studying and then placed under our travel ban, essentially house arrest only to be jailed a few months later and remains incognito today. So there's this decades-long span of Saudi Arabia not only forcing its nationals to return to the kingdom - I can't tell you how many times I've spoken to Saudis in Europe or the U.S. who tell me that at least they've gotten a call from the nearby consulate or embassy, at least they've had messages relayed to them via their families that the government was unhappy with something they'd posted or tweeted or were doing. And there's the sense that the eyes and the arms of their government were very very long and very far-reaching and it's very unnerving for them and has done a lot to silence and discourage activism.\n\nGG : You mentioned the case that you wrote about of a woman who was an activist for women's rights being essentially abducted or lured away from the United Arab Emirates and hasn't been heard from since. As you know the Saudis have long invested millions and millions of dollars on their image in western capitals certainly in Washington. MbS has been particularly fixated on that and the kind of crown jewel of his image as a reformer has been this theme that he has liberated women from the ban on driving.\n\nCNBC : So it's a historic time in Saudi Arabia. Women here are finally hitting the road from Riyadh and across the country. Over 120,000 women have already applied to get their licenses.\n\nCNN : Women in Saudi Arabia are finally getting behind the wheel. The journey has been long and fraught with challenges.\n\nCBS : A group of brave Saudi women protested for 28 years demanding the right to drive and risking arrest but they didn't get anywhere until Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman began shaking up this Islamic Kingdom with a series of reforms allowing cinemas --\n\nGG : How real is that given that activists who are working for that are simultaneously being imprisoned? How much of that is PR? How much of that is a real reform in the broader context of the trends within Saudi Arabia?\n\nSA : I was there in Saudi Arabia in June when women were given the right to drive. And I cannot tell you the weight that so many women sort of bore as they were forced to swallow that bitter irony of having finally had this breakthrough but having most of their champions at that point in jail. There was an incredible pomp and circumstance throughout the kingdom. Journalists were flown in, toured around, brought to curated events where they were ensured to see women celebrating, women excited, smiling women, women getting behind the wheels of cars. It was incredibly well photo opt.\n\nAnd I was really, along with so many of the women I interviewed, disheartened and sort of found it hard to believe that there was so much willful ignorance or so much ability to hold such cognitive dissonance. But the Western press went along with it largely. Most stories that ran the day that women first took to the road were glowing just bubbly accounts of how excited, unanimously how excited all of the Saudi women were to be driving with perhaps a note, a footnote or a sentence that added that there are a few women in jail right now and people are calling for their release.\n\nAnd even the women who were willing to speak to me about their activism were incredibly nervous about going on the record and most of them, if you look at what they were posting on social media at the time, were praising Mohammed Bin Salman with every other breath just as a form of protection in private. They may have other feelings, but there's this sense that you need to be ostentatiously a fan of the Crown Prince it's not enough to be neutral but it's necessary now to perform your loyalty to the royal family and to MbS in particular in order to stay safe. Even many of those women have since gone offline. Their twitter accounts have gone dark. There's just this incredible chill through, not just the activist community, but the Saudi community in general.\n\nGG : There's obviously a lot of pressure and PR costs to being associated with the Saudis right now which is why you see all kinds of people, obviously reluctantly, doing things like pulling out of the day of the Davos in the Desert event as it was called and otherwise expressing a kind of denunciation of the Saudi Crown Prince that previously was unthinkable. At the same time the U.S.-Saudi partnership goes back decades. It extends to every industry. When MbS came to the U.S. he met with, you know, had the red carpet rolled out for him by Silicon Valley executives, Hollywood celebrities, Wall Street. There's a lot of money at stake in terms of the Saudi-U.S. partnership, obviously, the defense industry is at the center of it. So how real do you think the possibility is that this could be some kind of a tipping point that makes it untenable for U.S. elites to continue to do business with Saudi Arabia or do you think it's more likely that everybody is just going to wait for the anger to kind of simmer down a little bit and then go back to business as normal?\n\nSA : Personally, I would anticipate something more of the latter. As you mentioned it's an incredibly entrenched relationship that we have an incredibly lucrative one. I don't anticipate a sea change, although one would be welcome from many quarters including by many Saudis. However, my cynical perspective is, it is likely that once this simmers down, as you say, people will prove largely willing to let this go as well. And I do think part of the reason that perhaps MbS would have undertaken something as audacious as kidnapping or torturing or killing Jamal Khashoggi is because he understands that there's a precedent of Saudi Arabia largely getting away with egregious human rights violations and I do fear that this may end up being another case of that. However it has captured the attention of so many of the media elite as well as the business community and even some celebrities. So that's not something that we're used to seeing too often and we're also in an era of social media that we've seen really leveraged against the perpetrators of Jamal Khashoggi disappearance. So there's been a very viable hashtag that's lasted close to two weeks and you know the awareness of this case has spread farther than most and it's so striking in its individuality. So let's hope that the story spurs some kind of real action, some sense of accountability or that at least the Saudi government feels chastened after this and maybe refrains from violating the norms of human rights and international law perhaps for some time to come.\n\nGG : Yeah or at least if there's a cost imposed on profiteering by doing business with a regime this tyrannical and this brutal.

He's sleepwalking into a catastrophe.\n\nUS president Joe Biden participates in a meeting in the Oval Office of the White House on June 17, 2024 in Washington, DC. (Kevin Dietsch / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIn 2015, Joe Biden was considering running for president. According to Biden himself, the man who convinced him not to do it was Mike Donilon, one of a tiny circle of advisers who have been with Biden for decades. The president listens to him. And, according to a new report in Axios , Mike Donilon isn't worried about his boss's reelection. A \"common Donilon refrain\" is that \"Joe Biden is a great president, and great presidents get re-elected.\"\n\nWhether Joe Biden is actually a great president, of course, is a matter of opinion. And Donilon's opinion doesn't seem to be widely shared. Most Democrats told pollsters they didn't even want Biden to run this year, and most polls show Trump beating him in crucial swing states.\n\nAccording to the New York Times , Biden's three-person \"brain trust\" is made up of Donilon, Delaware politician Ted Kaufman, and Biden's former chief of staff Ron Klain. And the strategy the three of them have crafted for Biden is to emphasize Trump's badness - the exact same strategy, in other words, that Democrats have been pursuing nonstop since Trump came down the escalator to announce his first run for president in 2015.\n\nYou might advise Biden to shore up his electoral prospects by listening to the Democratic Party's base about Palestine and delivering concrete improvements for working-class people. Some of those improvements could be delivered immediately by executive order . And he could at least campaign on enacting more ambitious reforms like his long-dormant proposal for a \"public option\" in a second term.\n\nBut that's not what Biden's team thinks. The president and his brain trust think they need to be doing the same thing they've been doing for years: focusing all their energy on reminding voters of the January 6 \"stop the steal\" riot and Trump's loathsome personal character.\n\nDemocrats haven't stopped talking about January 6 in the three and a half years since the riot, and we're entering the tenth straight year of Democratic attacks on Trump's character. None of it has worked yet - Trump narrowly lost in 2020, he's looking competitive in 2024, and Biden's poll numbers continue to be wretched.\n\nBut, the theory seems to go, it will work this time if Democrats keep doing exactly the same thing but do it harder .\n\nThe traditional winning move for presidents seeking reelection is reminding voters of how much better off they are than they were four years ago. But that isn't really available to Biden.\n\nAs Matt Breunig pointed out last year, \"The recovery from the COVID recession has increased employment and compressed the wage schedule,\" both of which are good things. But \"the rollback of the COVID welfare state has seen free school meals eliminated, cash benefits for the poorest kids eliminated, ten million people kicked off Medicaid, and the return of our completely dysfunctional unemployment benefit system,\" which is not so good. There was an increase in household wealth , but this was mostly due to the inflation of home and car value, and owning a more expensive home and a more expensive car isn't much use to anyone who can sell neither of those things because they need a house to sleep in and a car to get around. Oh, and real wages have gone down since Biden took office.\n\nBiden supporters argue that it's unfair to blame the president for these developments, many of which were partly or even wholly out of his hands. \"It's not the president's fault\" is true, to a point - although only to a point. In some cases, the rules of the Senate, unfriendly state governments, and larger macroeconomic trends would have severely limited what could be accomplished even by a president with far better instincts than Biden. In other cases, he's quite clearly at fault. No one forced him, for example, to invoke the antiquated and hideously anti-working class Railway Labor Act to stop a rail strike at the end of his second year in office.\n\nMoreover, whatever you make of all this, if your theory of the case is that Biden is a president whose \"greatness\" will lead to him sailing to reelection, how much of this dismal picture is Biden's fault is somewhat beside the point. \"It's not the president's fault things are so dismal\" is not the stuff of which presidential \"greatness\" is made.\n\nAnd that's not to even speak of foreign policy - the area over which the president has more control. About 70 percent of Americans, for example, support peace negotiations to end the US-supported war in Ukraine, and the way the war has dragged on has allowed Trump to ( misleadingly ) posture as an antiwar candidate. Whether or not he'd ultimately be able to deliver, nothing's stopping Biden from at least trying to use his considerable leverage to bring the war to a close. If he wanted to, Biden could give a speech tomorrow publicly inviting Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to sit down for such talks at Camp David. No one's forcing him to take a more hawkish position.\n\nAnd, far more egregiously, no one forced Biden to go all-in on providing money, diplomatic cover, and two-thousand-pound bombs for Israel's genocidal war in Gaza - a decision that's infuriated Democratic voters in states like Michigan that Biden might need to win this November.\n\nThe Axios story quotes Donilon saying that current polls \"aren't fully reflecting\" voters' concerns about January 6 and the state of American democracy. But, if not from polls, how is Donilon detecting the level of importance of this issue for average voters? Does he have a crystal ball in his office? Is he employing a staff of psychics to assess the things in voters' minds that aren't being conveyed to pollsters?\n\nSpeaking to the New Yorker earlier this year, Donilon insisted that just as 2004 was a \"9/11 election,\" 2024 would be a \"January 6th election.\" But voters' concerns about terrorism weren't a well-guarded secret inaccessible to pollsters in 2004.\n\nThe problem with all-January-6-and-Trump's-poor-character-all-the-time is that it's been three years since January 6, and Trump's outrageous character has dominated the national conversation for the last nine years. The idea that there's a large pool of voters who haven't already factored these things into their calculations is implausible.\n\nIf anything, exaggerated claims about the degree of the threat he poses to democracy might be counterproductive, increasing voters' cynicism. The View 's Joy Behar has publicly worried that her show will be taken off the air if Trump is returned to office, and Rachel Maddow has gone so far as to insinuate that she'll be thrown in a concentration camp. But it may be hard for swing voters not to remember that Trump was president for four years already. If he wanted to ban the View or imprison Rachel Maddow, wouldn't he have already tried it?\n\nNone of this is to deny that Trump's contempt for republican institutions has often been alarming and disturbing. It's a fact that he schemed to steal the 2020 election, and that he's never backed down from the lie that he \"really\" won. But whether and to what extent Trump is objectively a threat to democracy is simply a different question from whether this is a winning message.\n\nOne problem is that it's a bit too obvious that when Democrats say \"democracy\" they seem to mostly mean \"Democrats being allowed to win elections.\" Surely democracy should be about citizens being able to use the political process to get the things they want - like the redirection of resources from unpopular wars abroad to making working-class people's lives better at home.\n\nRight now, it looks like Biden is heading into a nail-biter this fall. This contrasts dramatically to the presidential election that just played out in Mexico. Claudia Sheinbaum , the political heir of outgoing president Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) as leader of the Morena party, won an overwhelming majority of the vote - more than any American president has won in a very long time.\n\nHow did AMLO and Sheinbaum do it? It probably helps that their foreign policy stances have been far better aligned with the feelings of their constituents than Biden's have been (Mexico, for example, has supported South Africa's case against Israel at the International Court of Justice). But the main story here is about Morena's ability to deliver the goods economically. Juan David Rojas explains :\n\nMorena's crowning achievement is the empowerment of the Mexican working class. The monthly minimum wage rose to 7,468 pesos ($440), from 2,650 pesos in December 2018. The governing coalition has also bolstered the ability of workers to form independent unions and outlawed labor outsourcing. As a result, real wages rose by around 35 percent across all labor categories between 2019 and 2023. As one voter who traveled all the way from the border state of Tamaulipas to see Sheinbaum's campaign close in Mexico City told me, AMLO \"was the first president in my lifetime who ever gave a damn about the people.\"\n\nBiden isn't in any position to deliver the American equivalent of these dramatic gains, especially not with only a few months left in his term and without control of Congress. But he could at least make a stab or two in that direction. For starters, a surprising amount can be done by executive order. In 2019, Jacobin editor Meagan Day pointed out that \"federal law already requires the US Postal Service to have a brick-and-mortar post office in every zip code, and 60 percent of them are in zip codes with only one or no bank branches.\" Any president who chose to, she pointed out, could put predatory payday lenders out of business and signal a robustly populist willingness to take on vested interests by simply issuing an executive order requiring post offices to offer public banking .\n\nMeanwhile, when it comes to reforms that could only be achieved with a congressional majority, Biden could at least campaign on promises about what he would do if such a majority were forthcoming in his second term. This wouldn't even need to involve going beyond the ideas he's adopted (if only rhetorically) in the past. When he was working to quash Bernie Sanders's left-populist insurgency in 2020, he said that while abolishing the private health insurance industry in favor of a single system of \"Medicare for All\" would be a bridge too far, he did at least want a \"public option\" to compete with the private insurers. Then he dropped the idea cold after the election. Why not resurrect it? Pretty much every poll since the dawn of time has shown that at least going that far would be popular, and it would force Trump to defend the United States' ugly health insurance status quo.\n\nAlternatively, Biden could just stay the course. He could spend the next few months talking about January 6 and Trump's character all day every day, and see how that goes for him. At least if he loses, he'll have the comfort of a chorus of liberal pundits reassuring him that it wasn't his fault.\n\nBen Burgis is a Jacobin columnist, an adjunct philosophy professor at Rutgers University, and the host of the YouTube show and podcast Give Them An Argument .

Kelly, Roger Ailes, and Donald Trump are not the only men who have allegedly abused women from positions of great power,\" the website's staff wrote. \"There are men out there who have sexually harassed and assaulted women and gotten away with it who are now looking over their shoulders, hoping no one will be brave enough to tell the truth about them.\"\n\nThey are right. Weinstein is just one case of an influential man using his clout to abuse vulnerable women, and the number of such cases is likely depressingly high. But there was one powerful figure missing from Jezebel 's list of abusers: former president Bill Clinton.\n\nThe elements of the Weinstein scandal sound familiar. It was an \"open secret\" in the film world - so open that seemingly everyone now finds it hard to believe it could have taken so long to come out. At least one of the accusations was well-documented long before these most recent revelations. And then there are Weinstein's years of involvement in the Democratic Party, which have now led numerous outraged and embarrassed Democrats to condemn the former Miramax executive and even give away his campaign donations.\n\nThe question is on everyone's lips: how could we have let Weinstein's crimes continue for so long? Yet there's little in the Weinstein story - the years of whispers of impropriety, the past allegations by women, the intimate connection with a party that advertises itself as a defender of women - that doesn't apply to Bill Clinton.\n\nWhile Weinstein's decades of abuse have cost him his company, turned him into something of a pariah, and led him to the tried and true PR strategy of claiming sex addiction, Bill Clinton is doing fine. He's still heading the Clinton Foundation, charging exorbitant prices for speeches, being applauded at public events , and gallivanting around the world , most recently at Northeastern University, where he nearly crossed a picket line .\n\nLet's be clear: the \"whispers\" around Clinton's abuse of women have been far more specific than anything that appears to have trailed Harvey Weinstein before 2015. The allegations against Clinton even briefly became a campaign issue in 2016, when Trump cynically tried to use them to distract from his own serial assault of women. But it's worth briefly going over them again.\n\nFirst there was Juanita Broaddrick , who in 1978 was a volunteer on then-Attorney General of Arkansas Bill Clinton's gubernatorial run. One day, she made the mistake of agreeing to have coffee alone with Clinton in a hotel room. According to her, after a few minutes, the thirty-one-year-old Clinton started kissing her, and when she resisted, he forced her down on the bed and raped her, biting her lip so hard it swelled. \"You better get some ice for that,\" he told her before putting on sunglasses and leaving. A friend says she found her with her clothes ripped and her lip cut, and corroborated the story.\n\nBroaddrick later swore an affidavit claiming it never happened, a fact used by Clinton supporters to throw cold water on her accusations. \"I don't want to relive it,\" she explained in 1997 , when lawyers for another Clinton accuser tried to get her to testify in their case; \"You can't get to him, and I'm not going to ruin my good name to do it.\"\n\nThat second accuser was Paula Jones. In 1991, Jones, a state government clerk, was escorted by a state trooper to meet then-Governor Clinton in a hotel room. Jones thought she might be receiving a job offer . Instead, Clinton put his hand up her skirt, tried to kiss her, exposed himself to her, and asked her for oral sex.\n\nUnlike Broaddrick, Jones acquiesced when Clinton's political enemies tried to use her against him, and she sued Clinton in 1994 under guidance from Clinton-hating conservatives like David Brock and Ann Coulter. (Coulter allegedly wrote her legal complaint , which Jones didn't read, a fact that contributed to her public discrediting). After a judge dismissed her original suit - not because it was proven untrue, but because Clinton's \"boorish and offensive\" behavior supposedly didn't constitute sexual harassment - Clinton settled with Jones for $850,000. An earlier deal fell through because Jones had insisted on an apology .\n\nThe whole gamut of smears has been thrown at Jones over the years to discredit her story: she's a conservative who now supports Trump; she later used her notoriety to campaign for a Republican ; she appeared three times in Penthouse (though only once of her own volition); the magazine published a piece (written by a serial fabulist) painting her as a \"small-town vamp.\"\n\nFor some, the most damning evidence against Jones came when she claimed Clinton had two different distinguishing characteristics on his penis, which later accusers denied. But, as today's experts remind us, such errors are common: as the American Prosecutors Research Institute put it , sexual assault victims \"often omit, exaggerate or fabricate parts of their account,\" or they simply misremember.\n\nMoreover, a combination of legal bills, divorce, and taxes had left Jones broke, leading her to pose in the same magazine she once sued to keep her photos out of its pages.\n\nMost recently, former Arkansas news reporter Leslie Millwee claimed that Clinton, then governor of Arkansas, assaulted her three times in her editing room, groping her and rubbing himself against her until he climaxed. The accusations , which first appeared in Breitbart in the midst of the uproar over Trump's behavior, were supported by three people who told Breitbart that Millwee had recounted the assaults to them in the late 1990s. The story made a brief blip on the public stage before being forgotten almost entirely.\n\nThese are the most high-profile cases, but far from the only ones. There was also the flight attendant who claimed Clinton groped her in 1991; White House volunteer Kathleen Willey who has been saying for decades that Clinton made a \"very forceful\" sexual advance toward her in the Oval Office when she came to ask him for a job; and Hillary Clinton's cousin's wife, who said Clinton groped her at a wedding, putting \"his hand up there where it shouldn't have been,\" as the cousin recounted to journalist Jerry Oppenheimer.\n\nIn 1999, the DC gossip rag Capitol Hill Blue claimed to have tracked down numerous women who described incidents similar to those of Jones, Broaddrick, and Willey, and a number of them - such as former fundraiser Sandra Allen James - let the publication use their names (the Washington Post took these allegations seriously enough that it included them in a run-down of Clinton's accusations last year).\n\nThen there's Clinton's friendship with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, whose plane - disturbingly nicknamed the \"Lolita Express\" - was used by Clinton on numerous occasions, including more than a dozen times when a woman whom prosecutors believe to have been tasked with wrangling underage girls for Epstein, was on the plane. Perhaps it's just coincidence. But would we say the same if we found out it had been Harvey Weinstein's name on those flight logs instead of Clinton's?\n\nIt's true that the details around many of these accusations are murky. Yet at one point the crimes of Weinstein, Bill Cosby, and Donald Trump were also just stories - uncorroborated accounts floating around that many knew about but few dared to utter on the record. As New York Magazine 's Ruth Spencer put it in the wake of the Weinstein scandal: \"reminder that if you've heard 'rumors' about a guy you know being 'handsy,' the truth is going to be worse.\"\n\nTrue, for some of Clinton's most high-profile accusers, certain details or allegations have been reported as casting doubt on their stories. But it's also true that of the many women who've come forward about other powerful abusers, few have been subjected to the kind of sustained public grilling and scrutiny that, say, Paula Jones and Kathleen Willey received; in fact, such cases likely served as a reminder to women of precisely why they should stay quiet, lest they open themselves up to such relentless hounding and attacks.\n\nAnd yet, despite becoming a major flashpoint in last year's campaign (and despite the emergence of a never-before-heard accuser coming forward), the allegations around Clinton have again faded into virtual nonexistence. In fact, many of the media commentators who, quite rightly, have spent the last few days tweeting and writing about Harvey Weinstein to condemn him - and have denounced Trump for the same kind of behavior - have either ignored the accusations about Clinton, or outright dismissed them.\n\nThere's a disparity in the way progressives treat the allegations against Clinton and those of other powerful men. Trump, Weinstein, O'Reilly and the rest are unequivocally denounced as sexual predators, and their alleged victims are believed. But when progressive pundits even bother to comment on Bill Clinton's wrongdoings, the former president is merely accused of crimes; he has alleged misdeeds on his record; his actions require us to uncomfortably re-evaluate his legacy; his accusers are untrustworthy, or they're simply promiscuous; and besides, it doesn't matter, because he's not running for president anymore.\n\nTake Vox 's Ezra Klein, for instance. Last Friday he tweeted that he was \"honestly shocked how open a secret Weinstein's behavior was. And nothing was done! No social shaming, no quiet censure from his board, nothing.\" This was one of a number of other tweets on the subject. Yet despite having promoted two pieces gushing over \"the genius of Bill's speech\" at last year's Democratic convention, Klein didn't say a word on Twitter to promote Vox 's explainer on Leslie Millwee, and his only tweets about Juanita Broaddrick were two perfunctory ones promoting Vox pieces about her allegations.\n\nVox has published scores of stories on Weinstein, Cosby, and other serial abusers (many of them entertainers) yet only three about the accusations against Bill Clinton, a former president of the United States. One described a \"sometimes uncomfortable reevaluation of Bill Clinton's legacy with women\" and focused largely on defending Hillary Clinton from criticism over her husband's actions; another was devoted to discrediting Willey and Jones' accusations.\n\nThis is a familiar pattern. Teen Vogue's Lauren Duca has been vigilant on the subject of sexual assault, writing or tweeting about Weinstein and the various other rape and harassment scandals . But when the Clinton allegations were in the news, she tweeted a gif with the caption \"Tfw people want to debate how bad Bill Clinton is in 2017\" under an image of a distressed Drew Barrymore saying \"Please leave me alone.\" In 2016, she minimized the importance of the charges by pointing out that \"Bill Clinton isn't running for president\"; the same can of course be said of Bill Cosby, Harvey Weinstein, and many others.\n\nTalking Points Memo's Josh Marshall has commented numerous times on Weinstein and other abusers , but tweeted out a piece that suggested Clinton had been framed as a \"sex predator.\" The View 's Joy Behar has criticized Weinstein and Trump , saying the latter's victory proved \"men can get away with anything.\" But she called Clinton's accusers \"tramps\" and said Clinton was merely a \"dog\" who was no different from the many other men who cheat on their wives. Jill Filipovic recently charged that \"right-wing media pushed a sexual predator for president\" (i.e., Trump); as for Clinton, he was merely \" accused of \" sexual harassment. (She also promoted Buzzfeed 's Juanita Broaddrick piece, calling it \"challenging.\") One of the more depressing sights in the media's coverage of the Clinton controversy was watching presumably feminist commenters on Jezebel tie themselves in knots to dismiss Juanita Broaddrick's story after Buzzfeed's profile of her dropped.\n\nAnd then there's the Clintons themselves. Hillary Clinton has said that she's \"appalled\" by the news about Weinstein. \"The behavior described by women coming forward cannot be tolerated,\" she declared, and pledged to return the mogul's donations. But during her campaign, her staff plotted to discredit Juanita Broaddrick's accusations; her spokesman called them \"fabrications that are unsubstantiated.\" When challenged about her husband's accusers, Hillary said \"everyone should be believed at first until they are disbelieved based on evidence\" - despite the fact that for many of the allegations, no evidence has ever surfaced to disprove them, particularly Broaddrick's. When a protester yelled at Bill that he was a rapist, he shot back: \"if you only listen to one television station, and nobody ever tells you the truth, you get like that\" - fake news, in other words.\n\nTo some extent, these statements have to be understood within the context of last year's election; after all, Trump's attempt to distract from his own crimes by pointing the finger at Bill Clinton was a cynical ploy that deserved to be called out. But they also betray an attitude toward the Clinton allegations that differs markedly from those against other alleged abusers. When progressive pundits who are otherwise good on this issue weren't outright dismissing the Clinton allegations, they were soft-pedaling or simply ignoring them.\n\nWhat accounts for the double standard? No doubt it's the same mindset that led Gloria Steinem (of all people) to pen a New York Times op-ed in March 1998 telling feminists to resist right-wing attacks on Bill Clinton. She claimed there was a difference between the actions of Clarence Thomas and what Clinton was accused of by Kathleen Willey: Clinton made a \"clumsy sexual pass,\" she wrote, but it wasn't sexual harassment. (Clinton's \"pass,\" for the record, involved allegedly groping Willey's breasts and genitals, then putting her hand on his genitals.)\n\nIt should go without saying that whether or not Bill Clinton is running for president at a given moment is beside the point. Neither were Harvey Weinstein or Bill Cosby, or almost all the other famous alleged serial abusers. Nor should it matter that accusers' claims were cynically used by the Right to damage Hillary Clinton; why do people think Trump's Access Hollywood tape suddenly emerged a month before the election? At the very least, such arguments can't justify ignoring the allegations now that the campaign season is over.\n\nIf we were to treat the case of Bill Clinton using a standard remotely resembling that applied to abusers like Weinstein, reporters would be tracking down women who wanted to finally open up about their encounters with the former president. Prominent commentators would be referring to Clinton in the same terms as we now refer to Roman Polanski, Woody Allen - and, yes, Weinstein, O'Reilly and others. Bill Clinton certainly wouldn't be a guest of honor at an event honoring the CEO of a leading children's book publisher.\n\nAccusations against figures like Bill Clinton are inconvenient for progressives because they require them to denounce their own political standard bearers, even as the latter are subjected to virulent and sometimes baseless right-wing assaults on their characters and records. Such conflicts of loyalty are exactly what lead decent people to look the other way when it comes to people like Harvey Weinstein - he had befriended them, helped them, or shown kindness to them, so the idea of denouncing him seems out of the question. Better to close ranks instead.\n\nBut if we want the crime of sexual assault to be taken seriously, it has to be seen as something more than a political football.\n\nBranko Marcetic is a Jacobin staff writer and the author of Yesterday's Man: The Case Against Joe Biden .

      "text": "Our Media Future\n\nI don't care much about whether Juan Williams deserved to be fired, but this part of the Bill O'Reilly segment that got him in trouble is actually pretty revealing. Here's the setup from O'Reilly's monologue:\n\nOREILLY: Today on \"The View,\" the ladies addressed the shootout I had with them last Thursday when I said that building a mosque near Ground Zero is inappropriate because Muslims killed us there. That caused Whoopi Goldberg and Joy Behar to walk off the set. Of course, what I said is absolutely true, but is insensitive to some. In a perfect world, you always say Muslim terrorists killed us, but at this point, I thought that was common knowledge. I guess I was wrong.\n\nAnd here's the subsequent discussion with Williams:\n\nWILLIAMS: Wait a second though, wait, hold on, because if you said Timothy McVeigh, the Atlanta bomber, these people who are protesting against homosexuality at military funerals, very obnoxious, you don't say first and foremost, we got a problem with Christians. That's crazy.\n\nO'REILLY: But it's not at that level. It doesn't rise near to that level.\n\nWILLIAMS: Correct. That's - and when you said in the talking points memo a moment ago that there are good Muslims, I think that's a point, you know?\n\nO'REILLY: But everybody knows that, Juan. I mean, what, are we in 3rd grade here or what?\n\nWILLIAMS: No, you don't - but you got to be - this is what Barbara Walters was saying -\n\nO'REILLY: I got to be careful, you just said it. I got to be careful. I have got to qualify everything 50 times. You know what, Juan? I'm not doing it anymore. I'm not doing that anymore.\n\nItalics mine. So O'Reilly has simply decided that he doesn't feel like referring to \"Muslim terrorists\" anymore when the subject is Muslim terrorism. Too much work, I guess. He's just going to say \"Muslims\" and have done with it.\n\nBy analogy, I guess I can now say that Bill O'Reilly has an \"immigrant problem\" and be done with it. Sure, he says his problem is really only with \"illegal immigrants,\" but whatever. Everybody knows that already, and I don't really feel like qualifying everything anymore. Hopefully O'Reilly doesn't mind.\n\nFeel free to come up with other examples in comments. There's a million of 'em, and they do wonders for keeping public conversation in a permanent state of roiling hatred. I can't wait until we're all doing this all the time.

      "text": "Lindsey Graham No Longer Thinks Donald Trump Is a \"Xenophobic\" Bigot\n\nOnce a fierce critic of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) appeared on national television on Monday to say he no longer believes Trump is a \"race-baiting, xenophobic bigot.\"\n\nThe South Carolina senator, who in August condemned the president for attracting the favor of white supremacists in the wake of a deadly nationalist rally in Charlottesville, stopped short of outlining exactly what factors may have contributed to the stark change in tune-other than the fact that his former primary opponent is now commander in chief.\n\n\"He ran against 17 Republicans and crushed us all,\" Graham said during the appearance on \"The View.\" \"He ran against the Clinton machine and won. So, all I can say is that you can say anything you want to say about the guy. I said he was a xenophobic, race-baiting religious bigot. I ran out of things to say. He won. Guess what? He's our president.\"\n\n\"You're calling him a xenophobic, religious bigot?\" co-host Joy Behar asked.\n\n\"I did that during the campaign,\" Graham said. \"I did.\"\n\nWhen pressed whether he still believes that his past characterizations of Trump hold, Graham answered: \"No, I don't think he's a xenophobic, race-baiting religious bigot-as president.\"\n\nIn recent months, Graham has slowly emerged as something of a Trump \" whisperer \" in the Oval Office, with the two known to play golf together and work collaboratively on legislation. \"Lindsey used to be a great enemy of mine, and now he's a great friend of mine,\" Trump said during a meeting on immigration Thursday . \"I really like Lindsey. Can you believe that? I never thought I'd say that, but I do like him a lot.\"\n\nThe next day, the president's admiration for his new friend likely grew when Graham, along with Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), called for a criminal investigation into Christophe Steele, the former British spy who authored the infamous Trump dossier. Democrats slammed the decision as politically motivated and an attempt to distract from Trump's potential times to the Kremlin. Graham on Monday defended the criminal recommendation, adding that he did not believe informants should \"take their work product and give it to the FBI and the media at the same time.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Donald Trump Sues New York AG Tish James for Asking Too Many Questions\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James speaks during a rally in support of living wages for home care workers in New York, Tuesday, Dec. 14, 2021. AP Photo/Seth Wenig\n\nDonald Trump on Monday filed a lawsuit against New York Attorney General Letitia James that essentially accuses of her of investigating him too vigorously. The lawsuit asks a judge to stop James' long-running civil investigation into the Trump Organization's finances and punish the AG for her \"callous acts\" that have supposedly deprived Trump, his company, and his family of their constitutional rights. But in reality, the lawsuit is mostly a laundry list of times that James has publicly said she would try to hold Trump accountable. It also notes she has filed a lot of subpoenas in the process of investigating Trump.\n\nJames' investigation, which stared in early 2019, appears to be focused on whether the Trump Organization committed tax, bank, and insurance fraud. Based on the subpoenas her office has filed-the contents of which are public because the Trump family has unsuccessfully challenged most of them-she has been scrutinizing whether the Trump Organization improperly valued conservation easements, whether the company paid its taxes in connection with certain deals , and whether the company improperly inflated the value of its properties when seeking bank loans.\n\nTrump claims in the lawsuit that James knew her investigation was \"unsupported, unjustified, and unfounded in fact or in law.\" Trump's attorneys say that other state attorneys general-citing Louisiana's Jeff Landry, a close Trump ally -think it's a politically-motivated \"fishing expedition.\" The entire investigation, Trump's suit contends, is \"motivated by malice, political animus, and a desire to harass, intimidate, threaten, oppress, coerce, injure and/or retaliate against Trump and his business, the Trump Organization.\"\n\nAmong the evidence Trump's lawyers cite is a clip from an appearance James made on The View in which host Joy Behar pressed James on her investigation into Trump.  \"There are reports that you are trying to depose Trump under oath next month, tell me that's true,\" Behar said to James, who laughed in response.\n\n\"Defendant put her personal disdain for Trump on full display by responding to Behar's comment with laughter,\" Trump's lawsuit contends.\n\nTrump's suit also argues that the investigation is politically driven because a motion to compel Eric Trump to sit for an interview with investigators was filed on the first day of the 2020 GOP national convention.\n\nBut Trump has already tried to make that argument, as well as the broader argument that James' investigation is a \"fishing expedition.\" Eric Trump was subpoenaed in May 2020 and had voluntarily agreed to speak with investigators, until he abruptly refused shortly before the GOP convention was set to begin. James' motion to compel him to speak came only after weeks of negotiating. He later agreed to testify, but only after the election was over, saying James was playing politics with the timing. The judge in the case disagreed :\n\n[Judge Arthur] Engoron rejected that argument on Wednesday, saying Trump's attorneys had failed to offer any support for that argument and ordering the Trump Organization to comply with the New York AG's requests.\n\n\"This court finds that application unpersuasive, Mr. Trump cites no authority in support of his request and in any event neither petitioner nor court is bound by timelines of the national election,\" he said.\n\nThe Trump Organization did not respond to a request for comment on Monday, but James' office said the lawsuit was another blatant attempt to delay her investigation.\n\n\"The Trump Organization has continually sought to delay our investigation into its business dealings and now Donald Trump and his namesake company have filed a lawsuit as an attempted collateral attack on that investigation,\" James said in a statement. \"To be clear, neither Mr. Trump nor the Trump Organization get to dictate if and where they will answer for their actions. Our investigation will continue undeterred because no one is above the law, not even someone with the name Trump.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

Hillary hit the couch on \"The View\" this morning as part of a PR blitz for the reissue of It Takes a Village. Her big revelation? That \"we are probably as fanatic about Christmas as anybody you'll meet.\" Really? Have you met Melody Howell , who decorates her home with 52 fresh-cut Christmas trees, including one in her bathtub? Now that is Christmas fighting back with the big guns.\n\nThe Viewsters did try to ask Hillary the big questions, with Joy Behar asking if she was sorry for voting for the Iraq War (and getting the usual \"if we had known then...\"), and guest host Crystal McCrary Anthony asking the world's most torturous version of \"are you running?\" Crystal's wind-up was so labored that she gave Hillary lots of lifelines to grab; Hillary went with some blather about the \"hyper-connectedness\" of today's world, which gave her ample opportunity to be worried \"for our kids,\" bringing us back safely to It Takes a Village territory. Responding to the question of whether we are ready for a female president, Hillary made the point that there's only one way to find out, but conceded: \"It's such a leap of faith, and I'm well aware of that-it's way out there.\"\n\nBut line of the day goes to Rosie, who capped a discussion of Hillary's love of crafts (hey, it was \"The View,\" not \"Meet the Press\") with \"you'd be surprised how crafty she is.\" Yep, the ability to take the innocuous and turn it into a backstabbing-now that is presidential.

      "text": "The Depressing Silence of the Actors Who Have Recently Worked With Woody Allen\n\nParker Posey, Woody Allen, and Emma Stone at the Cannes Film Festival in 2015. Joel Ryan/Invision/AP\n\nCould Woody Allen finally be having his #MeToo reckoning? Allegations of abuse have been swirling around the prolific actor and director for decades, but now, after a December Los Angeles Times op-ed from his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow questioned why Allen has been spared from the #MeToo revolution that has ousted other Hollywood moguls, he is seemingly, at long last, in the hot seat. She wrote that the #MeToo revolution has been \"selective,\" noting that numerous actors and actresses have readily dismissed Harvey Weinstein, but have said little about Allen. \"Although the culture seems to be shifting rapidly, my allegation is apparently still just too complicated, too difficult, too 'dangerous,' to use [Blake] Lively's term, to confront... It breaks my heart when women and men I admire work with Allen, then refuse to answer questions about it.\"\n\nFarrow also appeared in a CBS This Morning interview Thursday, publicly sharing her allegations on TV for the first time: \"With so much silence being broken by so many brave people against so many high profile people, I felt it was important to add my story to theirs because it's something I've struggled with for a long time. It was very momentous for me to see this conversation finally carried into a public setting.\"\n\nIn 1992, Farrow accused Allen of sexually assaulting her when she was seven years old, and has since spoken about the allegations in a 2013 interview with Vanity Fair , and wrote about the assault in 2014 in an open letter in the New York Times. Allen has long denied the allegations, and though Farrow's case has drawn intense public scrutiny over the years, it has not prevented Allen from continuing to profit from an award-winning career.\n\nActors who have worked with Allen, though, are now finally starting to speak out against him. Greta Gerwig and Mira Sorvino, for instance, have both recently since said they regretted working with Allen. But it's not yet clear if the director will finally fall out of favor, and Gerwig and Sorvino seem to be more the exception than the rule. There's a long history of actors who've starred in Allen's films, including some of Hollywood's biggest stars, side-stepping the issue, avoiding it entirely, or outright defending Allen. Notably, Alec Baldwin, who appeared in Allen's 2013 film Blue Jasmine, defended the director on Twitter earlier this week, calling others' renunciation of him \" unfair and sad .\"\n\nHere, we look back at the actors who've appeared in Allen's films (and his recent Amazon TV series) since Farrow's 2014 letter and what they have said or done in response to the allegations-or, in many cases, how they've stayed silent.\n\nTimothée Chalamet announced this week he's donating his salary from the film to Hollywood's Time's Up initiative, the LGBT Center in New York, and the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN), the largest anti-sexual violence organization in the US. Chalamet said in an Instagram post that due to \"contractual obligations\" he could not comment on his decision to work with Allen, but wrote: \"I don't want to profit from my work on the film. I want to be worthy of standing shoulder to shoulder with the brave artists who are fighting for all people to be treated with the respect and dignity they deserve.\"\n\nSelena Gomez reportedly donated more than her salary from the film to Time's Up Legal Defense Fund , an initiative housed at and administered by the National Women's Law Center, but has not disavowed Allen publicly. When asked late last year whether she considered Allen's past before deciding to work with him, Gomez told Billboard : \"To be honest, I'm not sure how to answer-not because I'm trying to back away from it. [The Harvey Weinstein allegations] actually happened right after I had started [on the movie]. They popped up in the midst of it. And that's something, yes, I had to face and discuss. I stepped back and thought, 'Wow, the universe works in interesting ways.'\"\n\nRebecca Hall donated her salary from the film to Time's Up earlier this month. \"After reading and re-reading Dylan Farrow's statements of a few days ago and going back and reading the older ones-I see, not only how complicated this matter is, but that my actions have made another woman feel silenced and dismissed,\" Hall, who also appeared in Allen's 2012 film Vicky Cristina Barcelona , wrote in an Instagram post . \"That is not something that sits easily with me in the current or indeed any moment, and I am profoundly sorry. I regret this decision and wouldn't make the same one today.\"\n\nGriffin Newman tweeted in October that he would donate his entire salary from the movie to RAINN, saying he \"deeply [regrets]\" his decision to work with Allen. Even though he only appears in one scene, he says, \"I can't keep professionally operating from a place of fear. It's time to show a courage in my actions mirroring my words without concession.\"\n\nElle Fanning , Jude Law , Diego Luna, and Liev Schreiber have not commented on the allegations.\n\nDavid Krumholtz tweeted in January that he \"deeply regret[s]\" working with Allen. \"It's one of my most heartbreaking mistakes. We can no longer let these men represent us in entertainment, politics, or any other realm.\"\n\nJustin Timberlake has not disavowed Allen, saying in November on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert that working with him was like \" a dream come true .\" Timberlake was blasted on social media for wearing a Time's Up pin at the Golden Globes after working with Allen.\n\nKate Winslet has yet to comment on Allen in connection to #MeToo, and side-stepped the issue in a December 2017 interview with Variety . \"It's just a difficult discussion,\" she said. \"I'd rather respectfully not enter it today.\"\n\nEarlier, in a September 2017 interview with the New York Times, Winslet defended Allen, calling him an \"incredible director.\" \"Of course one thinks about it,\" Winslet told the Times of the allegations against Allen. \"But at the same time, I didn't know Woody and I don't know anything about that family. As the actor in the film, you just have to step away and say, I don't know anything, really, and whether any of it is true or false. Having thought it all through, you put it to one side and just work with the person.\"\n\nJim Belushi has not commented on the allegations.\n\nRachel Brosnahan said in an interview on a Hollywood Reporter podcast this week that she regrets working with Allen. \"I had a great experience working on that project. But I do have to take this opportunity to say that, for me, I have really struggled with the decision to do that project for a long time,\" she said. \"Honestly, it's the decision that I have made in my life that is the most inconsistent with everything I stand for and believe in, both publicly and privately. And while I can't take it back, it's important to me, moving forward, to make decisions that better reflect the things that I value and my worldview.\"\n\nMiley Cyrus , when asked about Dylan Farrow's allegations in an October 2017 Q&A with Variety , said, \"I live a similar life to Woody-I live a public life. Until I know someone and I know their story, I never really judge anyone. That's kind of how I went into it. From the way I saw him with his family, I never saw him be anything but an incredible person and a really great dad. People might slam me for saying that. I'm sure it was a hard time for that family. My family has been through hard things, and I think everyone's suffering is different.\"\n\nJoy Behar has not commented on the allegations.\n\nJesse Eisenberg has defended Allen as recently as 2016, saying he had no problem working with the director. \"It didn't factor into my opinion,\" he said of Farrow's allegations in an interview that year with HuffPostUK . \"I don't think it's appropriate to try people in the press. I have been tried in the press for minor, minor things because I mis-spoke or had a sarcastic line or something, so I understand what that's like because I'm in the public eye, and it's very painful.\"\n\nBlake Lively , while promoting the film, said , \"It's very dangerous to factor in things you don't know anything about. I could [only] know my experience. And my experience with Woody is he's empowering to women.\"\n\nKristen Stewart said she was aware of the allegations in a May 2016 interview with Variety and had concerns about working with him, which she brought up with Eisenberg. \"I was like, 'What do you think? We don't know any of these people involved. I can personalize situations, which would be very wrong.' At the end of the day, Jesse and I talked about this,\" she said. \"If we were persecuted for the amount of shit that's been said about us that's not true, our lives would be over. The experience of making the movie was so outside of that, it was fruitful for the two of us to go on with it.\" (Eisenberg has said he does not recall the conversation, according to Variety .)\n\nSteve Carrell and Parker Posey have not commented on the allegations.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix and Emma Stone, who also starred in Allen's Magic in the Moonlight in 2014, have not commented on the allegations.\n\nColin Firth and Marcia Gay Harden have not commented on the allegations.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Another Phony Planned Parenthood Sting\n\n<a href=\"http://liveaction.org/blog/planned-parenthood-ceos-false-mammogram-claim-exposed/\">Live Action</a>\n\nIn February, Lila Rose, a 22-year-old anti-abortion activist, made headlines with a series of undercover videos that purportedly showed Planned Parenthood employees assisting pimps with getting abortions and contraception for their underage sex slaves. It came out that PP had reported Rose's phony sex traffickers to the feds, but no matter. The hoax gave new fodder to the family-planning organization's congressional opponents , and Rose still cites it as evidence that PP has \"conceal[ed] statutory rape and help[ed] child sex traffickers.\"\n\nYesterday, Rose, a protegé of video-sting provocateur James O'Keefe , released a new video that she claims catches the president of PP in a major lie. Here's what she says she uncovered: In an appearance on the Joy Behar Show , PP president Cecile Richards lied when she said the following about a proposal to cut federal funding to her group:\n\nIf this bill ever becomes law, millions of women in this country are  gonna lose their health care access-not to abortion services-to basic  family planning, you know, mammograms.\n\nThat statement, Rose asserts, is \"blatantly false\" because PP does not offer mammograms. To prove this, her \"investigative team\" called 30 PP clinics across the country and couldn't find one that provided breast cancer screenings. Based on those surreptitiously recorded calls, Rose concludes , \"This is only the latest in Planned Parenthood's abusive and deceptive activity.\" Andrew Breitbart , who publishes posts by Rose on his Big Government site, has dubbed PP's allegedly false claims a \"mammosham.\"\n\nYes, but... As we've learned time and time again , these stings usually prove too good to be true once you scratch their heavily polished surfaces. The video that Breitbart  claimed showed Shirley Sherrod to be an unrepentant racist showed just  the opposite . O'Keefe's recent NPR takedown relied upon out-of-context quotes and sketchy video editing. Unsurprisingly, Rose's new exposé rests on a pretty flimsy premise.\n\nLive Action, Rose's group, claims that PP \"cheats taxpayers with imaginary mammograms.\" That's a pretty bold accusation, suggesting that PP is bilking the federal government. It's not supported by any financial or documentary evidence but rather on that one brief clip of Cecile Richards. Rose's interpretation of the clip holds up only if you  overlook or ignore Richards' use of the word \"access.\" In reality, PP does  provide women with access to mammograms-not by doing them  itself, but by making referrals. (Though, as reported by  Media Matters -which has done yeoman's work dismantling this and other stunts by Rose, O'Keefe, and Breitbart-some PP clinics have done mammograms.) While Richards' statement may be fuzzy, you either have to be unaware of PP's referral policy (which is described on its site )  or make a special effort to deduce that Richards is trying to conceal a giant fraud-one so big that it should be the focus of an  undercover operation that will spawn tons of outrage and gin up a  controversy the mainstream media will feel obligated to cover.\n\nAs Rose herself concludes ,  \"Sadly, such deception and manipulation should not surprise us.\" Oh  wait-I probably should have provided some more context for that quote.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "The Fight Over the \"Ground Zero Mosque\" Was a Grim Preview of the Trump Era\n\nProtesters demonstrate against the planned Park51 Islamic Center on September 11, 2010. David Goldman/AP\n\nThere's no one moment that gave us Donald Trump, because his rise was the sum of many afflictions: a susceptibility to fraudsters, a broken media ecosystem, a failing ruling class, white grievance politics, the arbitrariness of state boundaries in the Midwest. The man himself may be extraordinarily shallow, but the forces that brought him to power are historically complex. Still, there's one incident I always circle back to when I think about not just the last few years of American politics, but the last two decades-the 2010 fight over the construction of an Islamic center in lower Manhattan.\n\nFirst things first: The Cordoba House, as the project was initially called (it later took on the more innocuous name of Park51), was never just a mosque, and it was never actually being built at Ground Zero. When Sharif El-Gamal, a New York City real-estate developer, went scouting for space in Lower Manhattan, he settled on a spot two long blocks away, in an old Burlington Coat Factory on Park Place. El-Gamal, the son of a Catholic mother and Muslim father, envisioned a community space-with a mosque, sure, but also a fitness center, a food court, a day care, and an auditorium, spread out over more than a dozen floors. It would even include a memorial to 9/11.\n\nBut in August 2010, the details of the project weren't the point. As the white rage of the tea party boiled over that summer, conservative activists and politicians simply saw an opportunity. And so \"the Ground Zero Mosque\" was born. Glenn Beck connected it to the specter of Shariah law. Other opponents, after perhaps a cursory amount of Googling, concluded that naming the project the Cordoba House was an homage to the Muslim conquest of Spain more than a millenium earlier-in other words, this that was a way of declaring 9/11 a great Islamic victory. (The organization El-Gamal was working with on the center, the Cordoba Initiative, considers the name an homage to the history of religious intermingling in that city.)\n\nThe usual suspects fanned the flames. Fox News host Greg Gutfeld said he was going to open a gay bar next door to the site to troll the Muslims who would come to worship. The New York Post , which covered the whole saga with glee, allowed at one point that it was \"possible-maybe even likely\" that the project was \"entirely peaceful.\"\n\nPossible-maybe even likely! And some of them, I'm sure, are good people.\n\nA reporter for Fox's New York affiliate chased El-Gamal through the street, asking, \"Sharif El-Gamal, why won't you talk to us, sir, why are you running?\" Local outlets reported on El-Gamal's previous arrests and delinquent property taxes-delinquent property taxes suddenly becoming a subject of national political importance.\n\nBut with Congress in recess and the ascendant tea party in the news, other mainstream outlets piled on, too, allowing-not for the first or last time-the anger of conservative activists to serve as a sort of assignment editor. For a time that August, in the heat of the congressional Midterms, the Cordoba House was the biggest story in America. Republicans used it as a bludgeon against everyone else. And plenty of Democrats found it easier to fall in line than to fight back. Harry Reid came out against the project. So did Howard Dean. So did Joe Lieberman. Several New York Democratic congressmen opposed it.\n\nPolls showed a majority of Manhattanites supported the project, but nationally, it faced overwhelming bipartisan opposition. Then, as ever, people in other parts of the country were eager to use New York as a prop for their political agendas but cared little for the people who actually lived there. Sarah Palin, at the time the most prominent Republican politician in America, tweeted out her own call to action: \"Peaceful Muslims, pls refudiate.\"\n\n\"Pls refudiate\" was an easy term to mock, but Palin's message was potent. In North Carolina, a tea party nurse named Renee Ellmers accused her opponent, seven-term Democratic incumbent Bob Etheridge, of refusing to take a stand against the \"victory mosque.\" After footage of Cordoba (the Spanish one) flashed across the screen, she addressed the camera: \"We should tell them in plain English: No, there will never be a mosque at Ground Zero.\" Ellmers would go on to win in November, as Republicans across the country channeled the tea party's rage (against this, against President Barack Obama, against everything) into a landslide the nation is still digging itself out from.\n\nBy the middle of August, the project had become an issue of national importance so profound that Obama himself felt compelled to weigh in. Speaking at the White House's Ramadan dinner, he defended the project. It was a simple matter of freedom of worship, he explained. And that was really the issue here. Because the Park51 controversy was not just the story of one development in Manhattan. Park51 got the biggest headlines, but there were efforts to block the opening of mosques and Islamic centers in Tennessee, in California, in Kentucky, in Wisconsin, and elsewhere. There were incidents of vandalism and arson. In cities and towns across the country, the freedom of Muslims to worship was treated not as something enshrined in the Constitution, but as a matter of legitimate political debate-the kind of thing citizens could simply decide to stop, if they were loud enough. And they were really fucking loud.\n\nYou shouldn't be surprised to learn that Trump managed to fit himself into the story that summer, leaking to the press a letter he'd written offering to buy the Park51 property from El-Gamal.\n\n\"I am making this offer as a resident of New York and citizen of the United States, not because I think the location is a spectacular one (because it is not), but because it will end a very serious, inflammatory, and highly divisive situation that is destined, in my opinion, to only get worse,\" he wrote .\n\nThe kind of hostility to religious liberty on display during the Park51 controversy was considered simply ordinary in Republican politics. Antagonism toward a major religion, or at least this major religion, wouldn't stop you from getting feted in the national press or booked on Sunday shows, and it certainly wouldn't cost you many votes in a primary. Trump, who in 2015 would propose blocking Muslims from entering the United States entirely, understood that the professions of support for people of faith that undergirded his party did not apply to everyone. Quite the opposite-the opposition to specific groups was a powerful unifying force.\n\nThe Ground Zero Mosque was the story we really didn't need in 2010, but a decade later, it provides essential context for where we are today, not just for what it said about where the Right was headed, but for what it said about other people and institutions, too. The development continued, but the Islamic center hasn't materialized-it's mostly just condos now. On Sunday, Jonathan Greenblatt, the national director of the Anti-Defamation League, formally apologized for his group's prior position that the proposed development should be relocated somewhere else.\n\n\"As the leading anti-hate organization in the US, with experts tracking extremism of all sorts, ADL is committed to help our Muslim allies counter Islamophobia,\" Greenblatt wrote on CNN's website . But \"as a dear Muslim friend told me recently, ADL's stance on the Cordoba House project was 'a punch in the gut to the Muslim community.' I hope that by righting this wrong, we can be better allies in the fight against the rise in anti-Muslim hate that is coming-and it is coming.\"\n\nIt was a notable statement, freely offered. But I couldn't help but notice the forum it was published in. CNN, after all, was also a driver of the controversy. Here's a CNN segment in which reporter Deborah Feyerick interviewed El-Gamal:\n\nFEYERICK: Plans include a performing arts center, swimming pool, child care facilities, and, yes, a Muslim prayer space two blocks from the worst terror attack in U.S. history. Why not have a prayer space for Buddhists or Jews or Christians or why must it be Muslim? It can't be just a business decision.\n\nEL-GAMAL: There are Jewish community centers all over the country.\n\nFEYERICK: But the Jews didn't take down two towers.\n\nEL-GAMAL: There are YMCAs all over the country.\n\nFEYERICK: But the Christians didn't take down the towers.\n\nEL-GAMAL: And this is a need that exists.\n\nFEYERICK: For those still sensitive and so raw to this, their question-their overriding question is, why here? Why so close? It's two blocks but it was close enough that landing gear ended up on the roof. Why?\n\nThis was emblematic of the way this real estate project played out in so many news segments. Feyerick was just asking the question, you know-for those still sensitive and so raw to this.\n\nIn an in-studio appearance on Joy Behar's HLN show, Pamela Geller, an anti-Islam activist, proposed turning the site instead into a center dedicated to the victims of \"hundreds of millions of years of Jihadi wars.\" Behar pushed back, but these were the kinds of voices mainstream outlets elevated.\n\nThere was some real trauma there in some of the reactions from victims' families, but that didn't explain the totality of what was happening, and why it ballooned like it did. The national debate was an assertion of who counted and who didn't, a show of strength and power, wrapped up not just in the physical opposition to one group's religious liberty, but in the actions of the people and institutions who, when asked to pick a side, joined in the mob. I'll always think of the summer of 2010, and the weaponization of a construction project in Manhattan, as a flickering glimpse of things to come-not just the political potency of foaming prejudice against Muslims, but also the readiness with which those pushing the story were accommodated.\n\nThere really was a victory symbol in all of this-there were proponents of a political ideology using a construction project to demonstrate their power.

      "text": "Kevin Drum\n\nKevin Drum October 22, 2010\n\nReihan Salam is unmoved by Michael Kinsley's argument that the country is broke and we need to modestly raise taxes on high earners to fix things:\n\nBefore asking taxpayers - any taxpayers - to dig deeper, I'd gently suggest that we look at public bureaucracies. If the Milwaukee Public Schools spend twice as much as choice schools to deliver the same results in terms of reading and math scores, I'd say MPS can dig deeper, ideally by restructuring compensation and giving workers more autonomy. If one-fifth of public dollars spent on infrastructure are essentially wasted, as Barry LePatner argues in his brilliant new book Too Big To Fall , which I'll discuss in greater detail soon, I'd say the bureaucracies we've placed in charge of public construction projects can dig deeper, ideally by doing a better job of sharing data and using life cycle assessments. If we could reduce Medicare expenditures by 8% per year by creating a competitive pricing system, I'd say the federal government can dig deeper by making a commonsense reform that will leave the quality of Medicare unchanged if not markedly improved.\n\nI'm fine with this as a general idea. But let's look at these three examples. (1) There's no magic to cutting school spending. We can do it by paying teachers a lot less and wiping out programs for disabled kids. That might not be as good an idea as it sounds like - and in any case has very little to do with the federal budget. (2) Focusing more on infrastructure maintenance is probably a good idea. But it's hardly a panacea. (3) Competitive pricing reduces Medicare expenditures 8%, not 8% a year. And that's only assuming that the AEI study that produced this number is right.\n\nMy point here isn't that Reihan is wrong about making government more efficient. Of course he's not. It's that whenever you dig into this stuff, there's always less than meets the eye. My guess, for example, is that our infrastructure spending ought to go up, not down. We probably need to spend more on maintenance and more on new projects. And reducing Medicare expenditures is a huge problem, not a quick efficiency fix. Efficiency is a legitimate issue, but Medicare's problem is mainly that we pay people too much and demand too much medicine. What's more, proposals like AEI's for increasing Medicare efficiency are all frankly speculative. We should give them a try, but we should also treat them with the same skepticism that we'd treat any untested new idea.\n\nThe plain fact is that budget numbers simply never add up without tax increases. Not even close. We took a nice holiday from history for eight years under George Bush, cutting taxes and increasing spending and figuring that everything would come out fine in the end. But it didn't, and the bill is coming due.\n\nHow should we pay it? Well, the income of the rich has doubled or more over the past 20 years and their tax rates have gone down. Restoring their old tax rates, which quite plainly didn't produce economic stagnation, is part of the answer. Making government more efficient is a good idea too, though actual ideas for doing this usually stumble pretty badly when anyone tries to put them into practice. And getting Medicare under control is Job 1. But that's sure not going to happen any time soon after the Republican demagoging of Medicare cuts that's marked the current election season.\n\nTax increases are coming eventually for both the rich and the middle class. It's the only way to make the sums work. And since the rich have seen their incomes rise so much and have benefited the most from tax cuts in the past, their taxes are going to go up more. Nothing else really makes sense.\n\nKevin Drum October 22, 2010\n\nI don't care much about whether Juan Williams deserved to be fired, but this part of the Bill O'Reilly segment that got him in trouble is actually pretty revealing. Here's the setup from O'Reilly's monologue:\n\nOREILLY: Today on \"The View,\" the ladies addressed the shootout I had with them last Thursday when I said that building a mosque near Ground Zero is inappropriate because Muslims killed us there. That caused Whoopi Goldberg and Joy Behar to walk off the set. Of course, what I said is absolutely true, but is insensitive to some. In a perfect world, you always say Muslim terrorists killed us, but at this point, I thought that was common knowledge. I guess I was wrong.\n\nAnd here's the subsequent discussion with Williams:\n\nWILLIAMS: Wait a second though, wait, hold on, because if you said Timothy McVeigh, the Atlanta bomber, these people who are protesting against homosexuality at military funerals, very obnoxious, you don't say first and foremost, we got a problem with Christians. That's crazy.\n\nO'REILLY: But it's not at that level. It doesn't rise near to that level.\n\nWILLIAMS: Correct. That's - and when you said in the talking points memo a moment ago that there are good Muslims, I think that's a point, you know?\n\nO'REILLY: But everybody knows that, Juan. I mean, what, are we in 3rd grade here or what?\n\nWILLIAMS: No, you don't - but you got to be - this is what Barbara Walters was saying -\n\nO'REILLY: I got to be careful, you just said it. I got to be careful. I have got to qualify everything 50 times. You know what, Juan? I'm not doing it anymore. I'm not doing that anymore.\n\nItalics mine. So O'Reilly has simply decided that he doesn't feel like referring to \"Muslim terrorists\" anymore when the subject is Muslim terrorism. Too much work, I guess. He's just going to say \"Muslims\" and have done with it.\n\nBy analogy, I guess I can now say that Bill O'Reilly has an \"immigrant problem\" and be done with it. Sure, he says his problem is really only with \"illegal immigrants,\" but whatever. Everybody knows that already, and I don't really feel like qualifying everything anymore. Hopefully O'Reilly doesn't mind.\n\nFeel free to come up with other examples in comments. There's a million of 'em, and they do wonders for keeping public conversation in a permanent state of roiling hatred. I can't wait until we're all doing this all the time. It should be awesome.\n\nKevin Drum October 22, 2010\n\nHere are a few recent data points for you: (1) The New York Times reports that \"skepticism and outright denial of global warming are among the articles of faith of the Tea Party movement.\" (2) In the National Journal , Ron Brownstein notes that \"The GOP is stampeding toward an absolutist rejection of climate science that appears unmatched among major political parties around the globe, even conservative ones....Of the 20 serious GOP Senate challengers who have taken a position, 19 have declared that the science of climate change is inconclusive or flat-out incorrect.\" (3) It's not just Senate candidates. ThinkProgress notes that an analysis by Wonk Room \"finds that 22 of the 37 Republican candidates for governor this November are deniers of the scientific consensus on global warming pollution.\" (4) The Wall Street Journal reports that \"extreme drought\" has taken hold in parts of nine states stretching from the Southeast to the lower Midwest.\n\nAs it happens, this southern U.S. drought is probably not caused by global warming - not mostly, anyway. Like most droughts until now, its primary cause is natural climate oscillations (this year's La Niña) and bad luck (no hurricanes so far this season). But don't count on that continuing. In a new paper that reviews the recent literature on drought, Aiguo Dai of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder concludes that we're headed for serious and sustained droughts in much of the world. And not in the far future, either. As the maps on the right show, vast swathes of the world are going to be far drier than they are today in a mere 20 years. \"A striking feature,\" Dai says of his analysis, \"is that aridity increases since the late 20th century and becomes severe drought [] by the 2060s over most of Africa, southern Europe and the Middle East, most of Americas [], Australia, and Southeast Asia.\"\n\nIn other words, virtually all of the world except for China and Russia will experience increased drought by 2030 and severe drought by 2060:\n\nThis is very alarming because if the drying is anything resembling Figure 11, a very large population will be severely affected in the coming decades over the whole United States, southern Europe, Southeast Asia, Brazil, Chile, Australia, and most of Africa....Given the dire predictions for drought, adaptation measures for future climate changes should consider the possibility of increased aridity and widespread drought in coming decades. Lessons learned from dealing with past severe droughts, such as the Sahel drought during the 1970s and 1980s, may be helpful in designing adaptation strategies for future droughts.\n\nThe Sahel drought killed upwards of a million people, and since then the steady increase in drought conditions in sub-Saharan Africa has probably contributed to ongoing crises in Darfur, Chad, and elsewhere. Now imagine what the world will be like when droughts are twice as bad, last twice as long, and cover not just sub-Saharan Africa but upwards of half the landmass of the planet. That's not really something you can adapt to.\n\nAnd here's some even worse news: these projections are based on midpoint global warming projections from the last IPCC report. But those projections are looking increasingly understated, and the next IPCC report is almost certain to raise its temperature forecasts. So as bad as Dai's drought news is, the reality is probably even worse.\n\nThis isn't something that's a century in the future. If we don't do anything about it, it's more like 20 years away. Tea partiers and their Republican enablers can play make believe all they want, but their kids and grandkids are going to pay the price for it. Global climate catastrophe is looking closer and closer all the time.\n\nKevin Drum October 22, 2010\n\nThe New York Times writes today about the vast tidal wave of secret cash that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is spending this year to support the Republican Party:\n\nDow Chemical delivered $1.7 million to the chamber last year....And Goldman Sachs, Chevron Texaco, and Aegon, a multinational insurance company based in the Netherlands, donated more than $8 million in recent years.\n\n....The chamber makes no apologies for its policy of not identifying its donors. It has vigorously opposed legislation in Congress that would require groups like it to identify their biggest contributors when they spend money on campaign ads....\"The major supporters of us in health care last year were confronted with protests at their corporate headquarters, protests and harassment at the C.E.O.'s homes,\" said R. Bruce Josten, the chief lobbyist at the chamber, whose office looks out on the White House. \"You are wondering why companies want some protection. It is pretty clear.\"\n\n....The chamber asserts in filings with the Federal Election Commission that it is simply running issue ads during this election season. But a review of the nearly 70 chamber-produced ads found that 93 percent of those that have run nationwide that focus on the midterm elections either support Republican candidates or criticize their opponents.\n\nAnd the pace of spending has been relentless. In just a single week this month, the chamber spent $10 million on Senate races in nine states and two dozen House races, a fraction of the $50 million to $75 million it said it intends to spend over all this season. In the 2008 election cycle, it spent $33.5 million.\n\nI don't know about the rest of you, but here in California I've been watching the Chamber's \"voter education and issue advocacy effort\" for the past several weeks, and it sure looks an awful lot like the only issue they care about is making sure that every last resident of the Golden State loathes Barbara Boxer. But I guess everyone needs a hobby. The rest of their secretly funded hobby is illustrated by the Times in handy chart form below:\n\nKevin Drum October 21, 2010\n\nAfter a district court judge ruled the military's Don't Ask Don't Tell policy unconstitutional last month, the Obama administration went to court to defend it. Why? Officially, they say it's because they feel obligated to defend all properly enacted federal laws as long as they're even arguably constitutional. If that tradition were to die away, and presidents simply declined to enforce laws they disagreed with, chaos would ensue.\n\nBut is that the real reason? Partly, yes. But I suspect it actually has more to do with past promises Obama has made to various DADT stakeholders, especially those in the military. Basically, the deal he made with Secretary Gates and the Joint Chiefs is this: I'll let you control the process, write the rules, and move things along at a deliberate pace. In return, you'll promise not to publicly oppose repeal. The tradeoff is simple: DADT repeal will take a little longer, but it will end up having the support of the military leadership and will therefore be less contentious and more permanent. This is a win for both Obama and the military.\n\nFor better or worse, deals like this are just the way politics works. If Obama chose to drop the court case and let DADT be abruptly repealed before the military had its ducks in a row, the Pentagon leadership would probably take it as a personal betrayal by a commander-in-chief who had given his word on how this would all play out. That's not something a president can afford.\n\nThis, by the way, is probably also the reason that the public option wasn't added to the healthcare reform bill during the reconciliation process. Aside from the fact that Nancy Pelosi might not have had the votes in the House for it, Harry Reid had (again, for better or worse) agreed to drop the public option months earlier in return for support of the main bill by centrist senators like Ben Nelson and Joe Lieberman. Having done that, and having gotten their votes based on that agreement, he couldn't turn around a few months later and put it back into the bill just because he didn't need their votes any longer. No party leader can pull a stunt like that and expect to retain the confidence of his caucus.\n\nSo Obama is stuck. He gave his word to the military leadership, and he has to stick to it whether it's politically beneficial or not. What's more, I suspect that he really does think that everyone will be better off if repeal happens via the political process and with the full support of the military brass. His decision to appeal the district court decision was, as they say, heavily overdetermined. He had what he considered three good reasons, and any one of them would have been enough.\n\nKevin Drum October 21, 2010\n\nPolitico reports that the EPA is about to propose modest greenhouse gas emission limits for heavy trucks and buses. Stephen Spruiell comments:\n\nIt's going to be very, very difficult for Congress or industry to get the EPA to stop doing this. I'm fairly sure that the president can veto or ignore any law or resolution aimed at curtailing the EPA's power on this front, and we know where the Court stands. My concern is that even if the GOP takes the White House in 2012, the EPA will have set so much of this process in motion that it will be difficult or possibly pointless to undo.\n\nObviously Spruiell is unhappy about this, though I'm pretty sure these regs are only superficially related to climate change anyway. Basically, they're just an extension of the usual CAFE mileage standards, but ever since the Supreme Court ruled that the EPA was required to regulate greenhouse gases CAFE has become a joint DOT/EPA effort. That's a pretty thin veneer, though. Improving mileage automatically reduces carbon emissions, so EPA's involvement really has very little practical effect.\n\nStill, Spruiell is right in general: EPA is going to start regulating greenhouse gases, and they're going to do it because congressional conservatives unanimously rejected a climate bill that would have preempted EPA action and set up a better, more predictable 1 framework for reducing carbon emissions. So now we're going to start getting piecemeal EPA regulations that even liberals don't really want. Conservative compromise could have produced a bill that, literally, would have been better than the status quo by everyone's yardstick. The business community would have liked it better than EPA regs, liberals would have liked it better, and conservatives would have liked it better. But compromise is death with the tea party breathing down your neck, so instead we end up with the worst of all possible worlds. Nice work.\n\n1 Yes, more predictable. Ironically, for all the yammering that conservatives are currently doing about businesses cowering in fear because of the jackboot of Barack Obama's regulatory dystopia, they rejected a bill that would have removed EPA uncertainty and replaced it with known, reasonably measurable rules.\n\nKevin Drum October 21, 2010\n\nA few weeks ago, after Ally Financial halted all its foreclosure proceedings because it had discovered \"important but technical defects\" in its paperwork, all hell broke loose. Home foreclosures, it turned out, were routinely based on documentation that was sloppy at best and fraudulent at worst, and the stories since then have just kept getting worse and worse.\n\nBut those stories all started with an expose of \"foreclosure mills\" that was written last August by our own Andy Kroll. His look at this shadowy industry begins with the case of Ariane and Tom Ice, who were investigating foreclosures by one of Florida's biggest mills, run by multimillionaire attorney David J. Stern:\n\nA Florida notary's stamp is valid for four years, and its expiration date is visible on the imprint. But here in front of Ice were dozens of assignments notarized with stamps that hadn't even existed until months-in some cases nearly a year - after the foreclosures were filed. Which meant Stern's people were foreclosing first and doing their legal paperwork later. In effect, it also meant they were lying to the court - an act that could get a lawyer disbarred or even prosecuted. \"There's no question that it's pervasive,\" says Tom Ice of the backdated documents - nearly two dozen of which were verified by Mother Jones . \"We've found tons of them.\"\n\n...The Ices had uncovered what looked like a pattern, so Tom booked a deposition with Stern's top deputy, Cheryl Samons, and confronted her with the backdated documents-including two from cases her firm had filed against Ice Legal's clients. Samons insisted that the filings were just a mistake, so the Ices moved to depose the notaries and other Stern employees. On the eve of those depositions, however, the firm dropped foreclosure proceedings against the Ices' clients.\n\nIt was a bittersweet victory: The Ices had won their cases, but Stern's practices remained under wraps. \"This was done to cover up fraud,\" Tom fumes. \"It was done precisely so they could try to hit a reset button and keep us from getting the real goods.\"\n\nIf you want to know where it all started, read the whole thing. When you're done, you'll no longer wonder how all of this could have happened. It was baked into the cake from the start.\n\nKevin Drum October 21, 2010\n\nI suppose I'm going to have to cave in and start blogging more about the midterm campaigns. If I don't, I'm just not going to have much of anything to write about. So here's the latest on \"Hurricane Sarah,\" who apparently is creating quite a reputation for leaving chaos in her wake wherever she goes. For example:\n\nLate last Friday afternoon, Palin's political aide, Andy Davis, contacted officials with a competitive House campaign. The former governor would be available Tuesday, Davis said. As with Grassley, the reaction of the House campaign was to have Palin do a fundraiser. \"What [the candidate] needs more than anything else is money,\" said a GOP source familiar with the situation.\n\nNo-go, replied Davis, indicating that not only did she not want to raise money, but she also didn't want to do a rally. The preference was for something \"low-key,\" so Davis suggested visiting a factory or going door to door. But in doing so, the candidate would have to limit the exposure of the event. They could bring only one \"trusted local reporter\" along, Davis said, according to a source familiar with the exchange.\n\nWithout much media attention, such a grass-roots event would have done next to nothing for the candidate, said the source close to the situation. But the campaign - a lean operation, like those of most House candidates - scrambled to put together another plan that would accommodate Palin. They sent it to Davis on Saturday.\n\nThe campaign didn't get word until Monday morning, the day before the event was to take place, that Palin's schedule had changed. She couldn't come. Palin offered no reason for the no-show. After the experience, the campaign, filled with conservatives who thought well of Palin, began referring to her as \"Princess Sarah,\" said the source close to the situation.\n\nThat's from Jonathan Martin, who reports that Palin is \"kind and courteous\" when she actually shows up, but is demanding and erratic when it comes to deciding when, where, and how she'll show up in the first place. Martin's conclusion from all this is that it's a bad sign for a potential presidential run, since she's pissing off important people and demonstrating an inability to do logistics that no presidential campaign can afford. Maybe so. But Sarah always writes her own rules, and maybe the lesson of 2012 is going to be that logistics don't matter anymore. Maybe star power is everything.\n\nKevin Drum October 21, 2010\n\nHow dangerous is it to live near areas of heavy traffic congestion? Janet Currie and Reed Walker of Columbia University have done a clever study to try to get a handle on this. They took a look at the incidence of low birthweight in babies born to mothers who lived near busy toll plazas before and after E-ZPass was introduced. Their idea was that E-ZPass reduced congestion, and therefore mothers living near toll plazas ought to benefit from it. And they did:\n\nWe find that reductions in traffic congestion generated by E-ZPass reduced the incidence of prematurity and low birth weight among mothers within 2km of a toll plaza by 6.7-9.1% and 8.5-11.3% respectively, with larger effects for African-Americans, smokers, and those very close to toll plazas....The results suggest that traffic congestion is a significant contributor to poor health in affected infants.\n\nAs you can see from the chart, E-ZPass reduced the incidence of low birthweights by half for mothers who lived within a couple hundred yards of a toll plaza. The effect decreased with distance, and at about a kilometer out the effect went away, presumably washed out by the ordinary background traffic congestion in the area. Results are similar for premature births. The public policy conclusions are a little unclear here, aside from the fact that E-ZPass is good and breathing auto fumes is bad, but it's useful to put a number to this stuff.\n\n(Via Austin Frakt, by email.)\n\nKevin Drum October 21, 2010\n\nI don't know how seriously to take this, but I could use some good news and I guess I'll take it wherever I can find it. So here it is: Carlotta Gall reports in the New York Times that our offensive in Kandahar is going pretty well:\n\nNATO commanders are careful not to overstate their successes - they acknowledge they made that mistake earlier in the year when they undertook a high-profile operation against Marja that did not produce lasting gains. But they say they are making \"deliberate progress\" and have seized the initiative from the insurgents.\n\nWestern and Afghan civilian officials are more outspoken, saying that heavy losses for the Taliban have sapped the momentum the insurgency had in the area. Unlike the Marja operation, they say, the one in Kandahar is a comprehensive civil and military effort that is changing the public mood as well as improving security.\n\n....Apparently surprised by the intensity of the strikes on their supply routes, bomb factories and command compounds, many Taliban commanders pulled out to Pakistan, and most of the fighters have also slipped away or hidden their weapons, NATO commanders, local residents and the Taliban themselves say.\n\nNow, \"slipping away\" is what insurgents always do when confronted with overwhelming force, and the question is whether we can stop them from slipping right back in. But like I said: for the moment, this sounds like good news. And who knows? Maybe Karzai can actually take advantage of it somehow. Here's hoping.\n\nInexpensive, too!

      "text": "Dan Crenshaw Called for Civility on SNL. Maybe That Was the Joke.\n\nTim Murphy January/February 2020 Issue\n\nDan Crenshaw started off as a joke. On the last episode of Saturday Night Live before the 2018 election, Pete Davidson was rifling through headshots of candidates when he got to the 35-year-old retired Navy SEAL from the Houston area. \"You may be surprised to hear he's a congressional candi­date from Texas and not a hitman in a porno movie,\" he said, as a photo of the Republican-short wavy brown hair, trim beard, eye patch-flashed across the screen. Davidson started to laugh. \"I'm sorry, I know he lost his eye in war or whatever.\"\n\nThe reaction was as instantaneous as it was predictable: Angry tweets. An angrier press release. An apologetic phone call from Lorne Michaels. But as Republicans called for Davidson's head, the butt of the joke appealed for peace. The next day, Crenshaw filmed a video in his car.\n\n\"I want us to get away from this culture where we demand apologies every time someone misspeaks,\" he said . \"I think that would be very healthy for our nation to go in that direction. We don't need to be outwardly outraged. I don't need to demand apologies from them.\" The real tragedy, he added, was that the joke wasn't funny.\n\nA week later, Crenshaw-now a represen­tative-elect-was live from New York to accept the apology he insisted he didn't want. (\"Maybe the most uplifting moment in American politics I'd seen in a decade,\" gushed the conservative pundit Ben Shapiro.) A few days later, Crenshaw wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post calling for civility in politics. As Republicans limped into the new year, Crenshaw entered Congress as the face of a cultural counterrevolution, a beacon in a fog of toxicity.\n\nA year into his Washington career, Crenshaw has emerged as the breakout star of the Republican Party's Class of 2018. He's one of the most sought-after fundraisers and speakers in town, and activists are already buzzing about a presidential run. Crenshaw has the kind of platform it takes many politicians years to build, in part because at first glance he's the type of conservative who seems to have gone extinct during the Trump years-young and quick-witted, with a record of personal heroism and an earnestness about following our better angels. In a March 2019 profile of Crenshaw, Politico offered him as a counter to sycophantic Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, arguing that the Texan supported \"the possibility that the future of the Republican Party could be more conservative than Trumpist.\"\n\nYet for all that promise, his brief tenure has shown how strong Trump's grip on the GOP is. Members of the Never Trump crowd of Republican exiles had high expectations for Crenshaw, only to see him fall in line and run interference for the president-­on everything from the Ukraine scandal to the administration's child-­separation policy-in a manner often indistinguishable from Trump's most obsequious Republican allies. \"The pressure every day has been, are you going to go with Trump and defend him, or are you going to stand on principle and make the argument for what's right?\" says Republican dissident Heath Mayo, the Texas-born founder of an online movement dubbed #PrinciplesFirst , aimed at reclaiming the party from Trump. \"I think he's made that decision incorrectly, and played it too cute by a half almost every time.\"\n\nCrenshaw's first appearance on Face the Nation , a couple weeks after getting elected, was telling. \"This broad-brush criticism that the president is somehow undermining our democracy-I always wonder what exactly we're talking about,\" he remarked . Like most of his Republican colleagues, Crenshaw appears to have made the calculation that his political fate depends on not trying too hard to find out.\n\nBorn in Aberdeen, Scotland, to American parents, Crenshaw spent his childhood bouncing between the Houston suburb of Katy and various oil industry hubs overseas-Colombia, Ecuador, Egypt. His father was a petroleum engineer; his mother, a nutritionist, died of cancer when Crenshaw was 10. He traces his professional awakening to a book he read as a kid called Rogue Warrior , by an ex-SEAL named Dick Marcinko. It was real Rambo shit: In one scene, Marcinko eats the brain of a live monkey to impress a group of Cambodians. Crenshaw was hooked. \"I planned every bit of my life, from that moment on, on becoming a seal,\" he later said. After high school in Colombia and four years at Tufts, he went straight to seal training. By 2008, he was in Fallujah.\n\nNearing the end of Crenshaw's third deployment, in June 2012, his unit was dispatched to a village in Afghanistan's Helmand province. As they cleared the area, his interpreter stepped on an IED a few feet in front of him. Getting blown up, Crenshaw tells people who ask-and people often ask-\"feels like a truck hit you, and there's a bunch of guys in the truck shooting you with a shotgun, and also pouring Tabasco sauce all over your body.\"\n\nThe blast dismembered the interpreter; Crenshaw was knocked over. According to his official Navy record , Crenshaw \"selflessly refused to be carried on a litter, thereby preventing his comrades from exposure to enemy fire.\" He walked to a medevac, where he was promptly put into a medically induced coma. Crenshaw lost his right eye but eventually regained vision in the left after multiple surgeries. He made two more noncombat deployments before higher-ups final­­ly pushed him into medical retirement.\n\nUnsure exactly what he wanted to do, but with a notion of working on national security policy, he enrolled at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government in 2016-as strange a time as any to begin studying politics. On election night 2016, Crenshaw's Harvard cohort crowded into a Cambridge bar and munched on red, white, and blue cupcakes as the results came in. Some students cried the next day; others poured out their frustrations on the few conservatives in their midst. Crenshaw now says he voted for Trump in 2016, but he kept it to himself back then-his friend and classmate Allyson Walther, a former Navy pilot and current reservist, told me he \"didn't really publicize his support for anybody\" that year.\n\nHarvard \"makes everybody think they can be in politics,\" Crenshaw later said, and in his free time, he took a special class for veterans on how to run for office. In the classroom, Walther recalled, Crenshaw was a lonely voice from the right. \"Oftentimes they've just never spoken to a conservative,\" he has said of his classmates, attempting to explain how the left could be so intolerant of people who share his politics. (According to Walther, classmates sometimes tag Crenshaw in the alumni WhatsApp group when Trump et al. do something they don't like; he occasionally responds.)\n\nCrenshaw took a job on Capitol Hill after graduation and was preparing for a career at the Department of Defense when longtime Houston-area Rep. Ted Poe announced his retirement in the fall of 2017. A friend on the Hill convinced Crenshaw to run.\n\nDan Crenshaw went straight into Navy SEAL training after college, followed by three combat tours.\n\nDepartment of Defense/Wikimedia\n\nOne of the reasons Crenshaw is so important to the GOP is that he offers a vision of its future at a moment when the future seems uncertain. Texas' jagged 2nd District hugs the outer loop of Houston like a dancing Baby Groot , starting in the master-­planned communities northeast of the city and pulling in historically Republican suburbs before curling down into LGBTQ-friendly Montrose. Mitt Romney won the district by 27 points. Donald Trump won it by nine. In 2018, Sen. Ted Cruz edged out Beto O'Rourke there by one-close to the Texas Republican's margin statewide. The 2nd District, right now, might be a tipping point for Texas.\n\nHouston has traditionally churned out a mellower sort of Republican (think George H.W. Bush), but over the past decade, suburban culture warriors have been ascendant, led by Dan Patrick, a onetime talk-radio host who got elected lieutenant governor in 2014 and made transgender bathroom laws a keystone issue . Conservative activists dominate GOP primaries in Harris County, but the increasingly diverse Houston electorate often has far different impulses than the party's immigrant-­hating and bathroom-­policing wing. Crenshaw, a newcomer, was able to move between both worlds.\n\n\"He's an interesting, young, attractive candidate in a party that is somewhat sclerotic,\" says Jay Aiyer, a Houston-based consultant and Texas politics expert. Crenshaw didn't come out of the party's ideological institutions, and he had no record of activism-he was a blank slate. \"If you were gonna try to give him a modern equivalent, his background is really, really similar to someone like John McCain.\"\n\n\"Like John McCain\" can be a mixed blessing in GOP politics these days. (Crenshaw has criticized Trump's persistent belittling of the late senator.) Where Crenshaw's background appealed to mainline Republicans, some right-wing activists viewed him with suspicion. The culture warriors dug up Facebook posts in which Crenshaw criticized Trump's anti-Muslim rhetoric and took issue with Christians focused on opposing same-sex marriage. They bashed him as a godless liberal. But their attacks only reinforced his message: He was not running to represent the suburbs of yesterday. \"You keep electing old, rich, white people to the seat,\" Crenshaw told the Weekly Standard , \"you can expect the Republican party to be gone in 50 years.\" He wanted to make conservatism \"cool and exciting again.\" He jogged 100 miles around the district in five days to drum up news coverage, campaigned at CrossFit, and gave away AR-15-style rifles emblazoned with the SEAL trident. Campaign materials featured his headshot with a Texas flag for an eye patch.\n\nCrenshaw was egged on into running by John Noonan, a longtime Republican national security hand and former nuclear launch officer who had pushed conservatives to reject Trump in 2016. But Crenshaw drew support from the red-meat crowd, too. He got a big boost from another friend, Michael Berry, a right-wing radio host based in Houston, who long peppered his commentary with jokes about African American victims of gun violence. Crenshaw made the primary runoff by 155 votes, then won the runoff by 40 points. In a state where the party was in turmoil, he was a unifier.\n\n\"Let's face it: When you have suburban Republican-club women describing a candidate as a sexy pirate, how do you fight that?\" says Ed Emmett, the longtime Harris County judge who was swept out in the 2018 Democratic wave, even as Crenshaw won a narrow victory. \"You just can't beat a sexy pirate.\"\n\nThere's an alternate universe in which you've still never heard of Dan Crenshaw. If Davidson had just made fun of, say, Georgia's Brian Kemp instead, Crenshaw might have quietly disappeared into the anonymity of Capitol Hill, made friends with the right people, and eventually, if he kept voters happy, worked his way up to a position to run for something bigger. But SNL gave Crenshaw the floor, and he hasn't yielded it since.\n\nLamentations about comity have always been a good way to get attention in Washing­ton, but Crenshaw has sharpened his pitch into an ideology in itself. By the time he took office he'd inked a quarter-­million-dollar book deal-\"sort of a self-help book,\" he told one interviewer, about surviving \"outrage culture.\"\n\nCrenshaw believes that the \"mental toughness\" and \"grit\" that got him where he is today are being eroded. Instead, people are driven by \"this idea that you have to be offended, that aggrieved victim status is the greatest thing you can accomplish,\" he told Ben Shapiro last spring. That sense of victimhood has changed the way young left-leaning voters approach politics. Because young people on the left are socialized to feel victimized by the slightest provocation, he contends, they embrace identity groups to reclaim a sense of power.\n\n\"When you divide people up into different groups and talk about intersectional hierarchies of victimhood,\" he told the comedian Joe Rogan, \"fundamentally what it is is you're dividing people up, and you're saying your group is oppressed by that group, and if you vote for me, I'll give you power over that group.\"\n\nOutrage politics isn't just ruining comedy, in other words. It's a threat to democratic society.\n\nWhen Captain America sees your Captain America glass eye. #merica pic.twitter.com/0xHb9GjSmV\n\n- Rep. Dan Crenshaw (@RepDanCrenshaw) March 8, 2019\n\nIf what Crenshaw is saying sounds familiar, that's because it is. In the Trump era, conservatives have embraced \"outrage culture\" as the culture war's new frontier, the scarier successor to decades of PC policing. Donald Trump Jr.'s first book, published in November, is titled Triggered . Glenn Beck's Addicted to Outrage came out in 2018. When Crenshaw dropped by Candace Owens' podcast to talk, in part, about his forthcoming book, the right-wing commentator replied that her book about outrage culture was also due out soon. It's enough to make you wonder who, in fact, is really outraged.\n\nIndeed, Crenshaw's desire for \"good-faith\" idea-driven debate seems to fade when there's an opportunity to score points against the opposition. Take what happened with Rep. Ilhan Omar. Last March, the Minnesota Democrat gave a speech to the Council on American-Islamic Relations in which she praised the group for defending a vulnerable community. \"CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties,\" she said. Crenshaw pounced. (CAIR, for the record, was founded in 1994.)\n\n\"First Member of Congress to ever describe terrorists who killed thousands of Americans on 9/11 as 'some people who did something,'\" he tweeted , with a link to the video. \"Unbelievable.\"\n\nCrenshaw's tweet started a chain reaction of outrage. The New York Post front page depicted the burning World Trade Center with the text \"Here's your something.\" Brian Kilmeade said , \"You have to wonder if she's an American first.\" The president eventually told Omar to go back to the country she fled as a child. She was besieged with death threats.\n\nOmar referred to 9/11 the way she did because that's just how people talk-her point was that one group of people doing anything shouldn't cost an entire religious minority its rights. Crenshaw didn't even have a problem with the substance of her argument, just her phrasing, he explained in an interview not long afterward. In fact, he agreed with it. When Omar's colleagues called him out, Crenshaw played the innocent. The outrage mob was going after him!\n\nAsked about the Omar controversy, Crenshaw's spokesperson, Kerry Rom, directed me in an email to Crenshaw's Washington Post op-ed about civility, saying his statement \"fell in line with the guidelines of debate he lays out...He attacked an idea/a statement, not the person behind it. That's the appropriate way to disagree in public discourse.\"\n\nIt was fitting that someone who was elevated to public life as the anti-­outrage candidate was feeding it so eagerly in practice, because when you get down to it, the backlash to outrage culture is no different from anything else in politics; it's a choice about what you get mad about and what you let slide. In this case, Crenshaw targeted the words of an immigrant from a community (Somali refugees) targeted by Trump for exclusion from the country, who belongs to a faith group also targeted by the president for exclusion, discussing a real period of discrimination against people like her. Crenshaw could have spoken out about those things; instead, he used his big platform to make the smallest possible point.\n\nA month later, when Crenshaw defended his criticism of Omar on The View -­because Crenshaw is already the kind of politician who appears on The View -co-host Joy Behar brought up Trump's famous defense of the violent white nationalist mob that descended on Charlottesville in 2017, in which the president said there were \"very fine people on both sides.\" Crenshaw tried to correct her.\n\n\"In that same sentence when he said that, he also said, 'I am definitely not referring to white nationalists,'\" Crenshaw said .\n\n\"Why do you apologize for him?\" Behar asked.\n\n\"I'm not apologizing,\" Crenshaw said. \"You have to read what he actually said.\"\n\nTrump did say, later in his remarks, that he wasn't referring to white nationalists-but who else would have been attending a white nationalist rally? It was the kind of quibble that begged the question of why it was being raised at all; it does not matter if a glass is half empty or half full if it contains arsenic. \"He's been angling, he's been trying to come out clean on the other side by not angering folks,\" says Mayo, the Never Trumper. \"And in this moment, if you're playing politics and angling, you're not being principled.\"\n\nThere's a lot that a principled young do-gooder could find to decry in Trump's Washington-massive corruption, the use of foreign policy for personal gain, the targeting of political enemies, a deliberate effort to block action on climate change (an issue Crenshaw says the country should be concerned about), routine flouting of laws and precedents, and a persistent targeting of communities of color. But talking about any of those things is a terrible way to get ahead as a Republican. Just ask Rep. Justin Amash .\n\nIf you set aside the outrage-outrage, Crenshaw isn't really selling anything new. He believes Republicans can win over young people by talking more about the national debt and how to rein in spending on Social Security and Medicare-­something Republicans have been talking about for decades. He wants a more hawkish presence in the Middle East (he opposed Trump's withdrawal of troops from Syria) and believes we should stay in Afghanistan. He thinks Trump uses the wrong language to talk about immigrants, but wants a wall built yester­day. Trump was right on the border, right on taxes, right on health care, and mostly right on guns.\n\nShortly after getting elected, Crenshaw visited Mar-a-Lago for a $2,500-a-plate fundraiser sponsored by Turning Point USA, the uber-Trumpy young conservatives group, at which Rush Limbaugh received a lifetime achievement award. Someone who quotes and repeatedly references viral Ben Shapiro videos (Crenshaw likes to cite one that's titled \" Ben Shapiro Destroys Socialism \" or variously \" FACTS NOT FEELINGS: Ben Shapiro destroys & humiliates little socialist comrade \") is not, as the Houston Chronicle suggested in October, building a \"GOP brand independent of Trump.\" What he's building, instead, is a bridge between Trump and the Republicans supplanted by Trump-it turns out the divide isn't so vast after all.\n\nIt is a delicate balance to strike, though, because while Crenshaw exudes a calmer, less conspiratorial politics than Trump, the president is endangering Republicans in suburban areas like the ones Crenshaw represents. Crenshaw's race is not one of the six Texas districts currently targeted by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, but that could change. \"He's definitely done a good job of putting himself in front of TV cameras and getting his name out, but he's clearly not interested in what the people of his district have to say,\" one of his Democratic oppo­nents, a Navy vet turned teacher named Elisa Cardnell, told me, after rattling off a list of legislation that Crenshaw had opposed. \"He voted against HR 8, which was the universal background checks bill,\" she said. \"He voted against the renewal of the Violence Against Women Act. He voted against the Equality Act,\" which would bar discrimination on the basis of sexual orien­tation and gender identity. (Efforts to expand such protections, Crenshaw told a group of pastors during his campaign, were an attempt \"to destroy the traditions we hold dear,\" Houston's OutSmart magazine reported.)\n\nIn late September, I caught the Crenshaw show for myself at a mostly full auditorium of College Republicans at George Washington University. It had been one of those afternoons in Trump-era Washington where the headlines read like Mad Libs . Earlier that day, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced an official impeachment inquiry into Trump's attempt to get Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. Trump accused his critics of a \"witch hunt scam.\" As his party careened toward crisis, Crenshaw seemed blissfully at ease.\n\nCrenshaw had prepared a presentation to go along with his remarks, filled with photos (puppies!), charts, and funny videos. His message was a familiar one-Crenshaw implored the audience to engage in good faith, to not settle for the temptations of emotion and identity, and to avoid socialism. A few minutes in, he paused to play a clip from the 2012 movie The Campaign , in which a debate between rival candidates-played by Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis-devolves into a comic brawl.\n\n\"Does that look familiar?\" he asked. \"Cancel culture, outrage culture. We are in full throttle,\" he went on. \"This is not parody anymore.\"\n\nTrump came up only once. \"He's definitely not my spiritual leader, but I like his policies, so that's, like, the simplest way I can put it,\" Crenshaw said, laughing awkwardly. \"His style is not my style, okay? To say the least.\" He laughed again. \"But the agenda is the right agenda and it's good for America-plus or minus a couple of things I might disagree with him on.\"\n\nThe next day, Crenshaw tweeted that Trump's impeachment-triggering phone call with the president of Ukraine was \"worse for Biden than it is for Trump.\" He subsequently joined a push by Trump loyalists to censure Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), chair of the House Intelligence Committee for paraphrasing (and dramatizing) the call at a committee hearing.\n\nTrump has alienated so many voters of Crenshaw's generation and younger, cost so many suburban Republican lawmakers their jobs, and surrounded himself with so many villains and hangers-on that someone with the nimbleness to be whatever people want to see looks like a unicorn. Crenshaw indulges in speculation about his future without a hint of coyness. \"There is no plans right now,\" he said recently about whether he'd seek the presidential nomination in 2024-but \"if the people want that, that's what would happen.\"\n\nBut for now, he's a lesson in how Trumpism ensnares almost everyone in Crenshaw's party. You can't escape it; you can only embrace it and hope the party doesn't come crashing down around you.\n\nTop image credits: Anna Moneymaker/Bloomberg/Getty; Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call/Getty\n\nThis article has been updated to correct a reference to President Trump's remarks following the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

You can read our Privacy Policy here.\n\nA couple days ago, a friend of mine witnessed this scene on West 65th Street in Manhattan: in a crowd lining up to get tickets for The View , two middle-aged women were talking excitedly about Joy Behar, though the comedian hasn't co-hosted the show for nearly two years. Suddenly, one of the women lunged at her friend, acting out that startling moment when New Jersey governor Chris Christie stole the podium from Behar during a ninetieth-birthday roast of former Governor Brendan Byrne on April Fool's Day. \"She's my heroine,\" the lunging lady said. \"She stood up to that fat man.\" The second woman replied, \"She's fearless. She got right up in front of him.\" Then she mimed the stern posture of what might be a mother reprimanding a son who towered over her. \"I've known women like her in my neighborhood all my life,\" she said. Other women in line were nodding in agreement, one saying to another, \"If Chris Christie thinks he's going to get somewhere by treating her this way, he's a fool.\" It's easy to overlook the effect Behar's run-in with Christie has had on public perception, especially on women. When the governor tried to intimidate the 71-year-old comedian, as he has so many women before her, she called him a bully and a coward. And when he physically got up in her face, she came back at him with more searing jokes. Christie attacks anyone who publicly disagrees with him, of course, but he's best known for bullying the female teachers who've protested his cuts to education, or the mother who politely asked, \"You send [your children] to private schools, so I was wondering why you think it's fair to be cutting funding to public schools?\" (\"Hey Gail,\" Christie responded , \"...it's none of your business. I don't ask you where you send your kids to school. Don't bother me where I send mine.\") His lawyer's report that \"exonerated\" him of Bridgegate tried to paint Bridget Anne Kelly as psychologically unstable after another Christie aide broke off a relationship with her. As if feminine emotion caused the five-day traffic nightmare on the world's busiest bridge. Five former governors and five comedians spoke at the Governor Byrne roast, and Behar wasn't the only one who detoured to roast Christie instead. But she was the only one he took on physically. We know all this thanks to Ryan Lizza, who led a long New Yorker piece, \" Crossing Christie ,\" with the roast incident and put his cellphone video of it (below) on YouTube.

Books & the Arts / Brett Christophers It went down like this: Like others at the event-including Governor Byrne himself-Behar cracked wise about Christie's weight. \"You have to have your eye on the White House,\" she said. \"It used to be the House of Pancakes.\" Sitting on the dais next to the lectern, Christie touched Behar's arm and reminded her, \"This is a Byrne roast.\" When that got big applause, he stood up and, amazingly, tried to grab Behar's notes. \"Stop bullying me,\" she told him. The audience laughed awkwardly: She called him the B-word to his face. Back in his seat, Christie said something that was inaudible and Behar responded, \"Why don't you get up here at the microphone instead of being such a coward?\" No doubt she provoked him, but, unable to control himself (you might say he was too emotional), he took the bait. He stood up again and, as she backed away in fear, he took over her space at the lectern, asking her, \"Really? Really, is that what you're thinking?\" Christie went beyond, say, Rick Lazio's infamous move into Hillary Clinton's space during a 2000 debate and into something more reminiscent of Ralph Kramden telling Alice \" to the moon! \" But Christie regained his composure, delivered a zinger (\"At least I don't get paid for this\"), and returned to his seat. Behar was noticeably rattled, as Lizza says, but she didn't back down. \"I really don't know about the presidency,\" she jibed. \"Let me put it to you this way, in a way that you'd appreciate: You're toast.\" In this brief encounter, you could find Christie's entire governorship: he intimidates, he threatens, he can't stand not to control the mic and he always gets the last word. But Behar was, for once, a female who got the last word-she signed off with a joke about feeling safe from Christie's wrath because she was \"taking mass transit home.\" Sure, she was scared of him, but she rebounded. Repeatedly. That's why she's a hero to the women waiting in line to get into The View.\n\n\"She's my heroine,\" the lunging lady said. \"She stood up to that fat man.\" The second woman replied, \"She's fearless. She got right up in front of him.\" Then she mimed the stern posture of what might be a mother reprimanding a son who towered over her. \"I've known women like her in my neighborhood all my life,\" she said. Other women in line were nodding in agreement, one saying to another, \"If Chris Christie thinks he's going to get somewhere by treating her this way, he's a fool.\" It's easy to overlook the effect Behar's run-in with Christie has had on public perception, especially on women. When the governor tried to intimidate the 71-year-old comedian, as he has so many women before her, she called him a bully and a coward. And when he physically got up in her face, she came back at him with more searing jokes. Christie attacks anyone who publicly disagrees with him, of course, but he's best known for bullying the female teachers who've protested his cuts to education, or the mother who politely asked, \"You send [your children] to private schools, so I was wondering why you think it's fair to be cutting funding to public schools?\" (\"Hey Gail,\" Christie responded , \"...it's none of your business. I don't ask you where you send your kids to school. Don't bother me where I send mine.\") His lawyer's report that \"exonerated\" him of Bridgegate tried to paint Bridget Anne Kelly as psychologically unstable after another Christie aide broke off a relationship with her. As if feminine emotion caused the five-day traffic nightmare on the world's busiest bridge. Five former governors and five comedians spoke at the Governor Byrne roast, and Behar wasn't the only one who detoured to roast Christie instead. But she was the only one he took on physically. We know all this thanks to Ryan Lizza, who led a long New Yorker piece, \" Crossing Christie ,\" with the roast incident and put his cellphone video of it (below) on YouTube.

Klein's assessment of Palin as something created in the basement of The Heritage Foundation seems to pin down the fact that Palin is overly engineered, and that we are witnessing her public malfunctioning. In addition, Klein draws a parallel to the familiar reality-TV narrative of \"country mouse goes to the big city\" as an explanation for why we follow the drama-a drama that might resemble a presidential campaign but will not, ultimately, be able to amount to one. - Fernanda Diaz Check out more great Nation videos on our YouTube channel .\n\n- Fernanda Diaz Check out more great Nation videos on our YouTube channel .\n\nCheck out more great Nation videos on our YouTube channel .\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home.

Behar points out Limbaugh's most paradoxical sound bite, and asks them: how can he say he hopes Obama fails and also say he loves America? Vanden Heuvel argues that even though this sentiment is old news, it is striking how it now represents the \"all-out war\" that Republicans have declared on Obama. She also calls out Fox \"News\" on their \"more than softball interview\"-why, if he already has a bully pulpit on his show, is his fringe conservatism being spotlighted as the mainstream Republican message? \"Moderate Republicans made sense [before],\" says vanden Heuvel, almost lamenting the way that Limbaugh's re-birth might lead to the death of the center-right ethos-one that is necessary for our country's two-part system to remain balanced - Fernanda Diaz Check out more great Nation videos on our YouTube channel .\n\n- Fernanda Diaz Check out more great Nation videos on our YouTube channel .\n\nCheck out more great Nation videos on our YouTube channel .\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home.

His campaign doubled down on that strategy Monday, launching a flashy ad touting Jay-Z, the rapper, business mogul and former drug dealer, as the embodiment of the American dream. \"The idea of America is that no matter who you are, what you look like, or where you come from, you can make it if you try,\" says Obama, adding, \"Jay-Z did.\" The ad shows Jay-Z, clad in a black suit and a tie, talking somberly about how many people's voices have been \"silenced\" in the political process, either because they were prevented from voting or because they \"didn't believe their voice mattered.\" \"Now people are exercising their right,\" Jay-Z continues, \"and you are starting to see the power of our vote.\" President Obama's lines in the ad were from a recording made for \"Jay-Z's Made in America Festival in Philadelphia on September 1st,\" an Obama aide told The Nation. While the video is not running as a TV ad, it could draw significant attention online, especially from young voters and African-Americans. In 2008, the Obama campaign distributed several Jay-Z videos that went viral, including footage of Jay-Z's poem about the legacy of Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King and Obama himself; a clip of then-Senator Obama using Jay's signature hand gesture to dismiss political attacks by figuratively brushing them off his shoulders; and a state-level briefing on voter-ID rules for Michigan residents. The Obama campaign has adeptly used YouTube and social networks as a relatively thrifty way to do targeted messaging. TV ads are great for broadcasting, but voter turnout is about narrow-casting. And not all messengers are created equal. \"Jay is an anomaly to an incredible degree,\" says Chuck Creekmur, CEO of AllHipHop.com . \"He's a great example of a possibility that is very difficult to attain for most kids from Marcy Projects,\" says Creekmur, who has covered Jay and Obama's outreach to the hip hop community. \"I'd like to see more messaging directly referencing the issues that affect the 90 percent of African-Americans who voted for Obama,\" he told The Nation . The Obama campaign is not limiting Jay-Z's voice to mobilizing the grassroots, of course. He and his wife Beyoncé recently headlined a $4 million fundraiser for Obama in Manhattan.\n\nPresident Barack Obama has touted hip hop endorsements more than any other candidate on the national stage.

      "text": "Candor, and Complaints, as Show Ends\n\nWhat to Watch\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nBy Brian Stelter\n\nWhen the cable channel HLN announced in November that it was going to end the comedian Joy Behar's 10 p.m. talk show, she played along, releasing a simple statement about how proud she was of the two-year-old program. No one at the channel dared to utter the dreaded word \"canceled.\"\n\nBut as the final episode approached - it was taped on Thursday afternoon - Ms. Behar started speaking with unusual candor about the circumstances of her show's end. And, even more unusually, so have her guests.\n\n\"Why are they canceling you?\" Denis Leary, one of her favorite guests, asked on Wednesday's episode.\n\n\"I don't know what HLN is thinking!\" exclaimed her friend Whoopi Goldberg a night earlier.\n\nJane Fonda, referring to her ex-husband Ted Turner, who founded HLN's sister channel, CNN, said last week, \"If Ted were still here, you'd still be on.\"\n\nMs. Behar will remain on the daytime show she hosts with Ms. Goldberg and others on ABC, \"The View.\" But she isn't pretending to be pleased about the end of her hour on HLN, called \"The Joy Behar Show.\"\n\nLike any comedian who knows how to harness self-deprecating jokes to best advantage, she has embraced the word \"canceled\"; nearly every night this month she has posted on her Twitter account , where she has 545,000 readers, some of the complaints she has received from fans. \"Please don't go, Joy,\" one wrote last week.\n\nCalling the reaction \"overwhelming,\" Ms. Behar said in a phone interview that she was actively pitching the lighthearted talk show to other networks. \"I'm hoping to be picked up by someone else,\" she said, adding that she would like to bring some of her staff members with her.\n\nMs. Behar said she had a meeting at one network on Wednesday and had two more meetings scheduled in January; she declined to identify the networks.\n\nThe Web, of course, has made it easy for all sorts of fans to mount save-our-show campaigns, but it's rare to see it happen on the actual program. On unscripted talk shows, at least, there are ample opportunities for critiques; Conan O'Brien taunted NBC in his final days on that network's \"Tonight\" last year. Ms. Behar said she had not prompted guests to talk about the cancellation - \"it is completely spontaneous\" - and she gave HLN credit for giving her plenty of time to conclude the show.\n\n\"I was fired from WABC Radio back in the day,\" she said, \"and they told me, 'Do not come back in this building tomorrow.' \"\n\nMs. Behar was hired by HLN in 2009 as part of an expansion of its prime-time lineup, but it became clear last spring that she was not entirely comfortable with the channel's shift toward crime and tabloid news, particularly the Casey Anthony murder trial. Her show was taken off the channel's schedule for a full week as that trial neared its end.\n\n\"I was sort of a fish out of water a little bit,\" Ms. Behar acknowledged, noting that \"they have a lot of crime on this network.\"\n\nShe told Mr. Leary during his appearance that the cancellation had \"something to do\" with the network's \"rebranding.\"\n\nHLN declined to comment Thursday, but executives there did not seem outwardly bothered by her candor. A spokeswoman confirmed that the channel would play reruns of Ms. Behar's program until January, when repeats of Nancy Grace's crime and justice show will take over the 10 p.m. time slot.\n\nFor the final episode, broadcast Thursday night, Ms. Behar enlisted the comedian Steve Martin to come on after he heard about the cancellation and wrote to her on Twitter, \"Too bad. Great show.\"\n\nShe said, \"The Twitter world is an easy way to book guests.\"\n\nAdvertisement"

Ms. Behar is appearing in public again, in \"Me, My Mouth & I,\" a one-woman show. But don't worry. This sometimes autobiographical, sometimes stand-up comedy concoction isn't looking to land you in the audience. True, it is aimed squarely at people who consider \"The View\" the height of sophistication, but only at the subset of \"View\" fans who admired Ms. Behar, often a polarizing figure during her 16-year run on the program.\n\nMs. Behar knows these people, they know her, and it all makes for a relaxing if nontaxing 90 minutes. After opening with some shameless name-dropping about famous people she encountered on \"The View,\" she transitions to her childhood in Brooklyn, one that sounds more or less like every other monologist's urban childhood, with odd, endearing relatives and religious and ethnic customs and quirks.\n\nShe tells of how she ended up married and living on Long Island, sprinkling the journey with anecdotes about her sex life and other jokes intended to seem cutting edge to people who watch \"The View.\" (\"I was a virgin. Let's face it: Who wants to be a virgin nowadays except terrorists and Mormons?\") Gradually, she works her way around to how she broke into show business, including a strange encounter with the early \"Saturday Night Live\" cast and crew and modest success as a stand-up comic.\n\nHard-core Behar fans might find a lot of this familiar: The show seems to include a fair amount of material from previous stops in her career. ( Ms. Behar is 72.) The bits about Long Island - Exit 60 of the expressway becomes a running gag in the show - echo parts of \"Joy Shtick,\" a book she wrote in 1999. As for its early jokes about Hasidic Jews and late ones about Lorena Bobbitt, here's what Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times in his 1994 review of \"Comedy Tonight,\" a short-lived Broadway show that featured four comedians, Ms. Behar among them:\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

The network, a unit of Turner Broadcasting, is expected to announce the hiring on Thursday.\n\nMs. Behar will work a TV double shift, as she will continue to co-host \"The View\" on ABC in the mornings. In a brief telephone interview, Ms. Behar said the new 9 p.m. show, tentatively titled \"The Joy Behar Show,\" will begin in the fall, most likely in September. She called it a \"topical and fun\" talk show.\n\n\"It's not going to be dry, I hope, because I'm crazy,\" she said. On \"The View,\" Ms. Behar is known for her sharply expressed liberal viewpoints. Ms. Behar's show will replace a repeat of \"Lou Dobbs Tonight.\"\n\nHLN, formerly Headline News, has had strong ratings gains in recent years with a lineup of opinionated hosts in the evenings. The network's signature show at 8 p.m., \"Nancy Grace,\" drew almost 900,000 viewers on an average day last month.\n\nBut the 9 p.m. hour has not performed as well. HLN started to replay Mr. Dobbs's CNN program in prime time last fall after Glenn Beck, a conservative commentator, moved to Fox News Channel from HLN. Last month, the repeat of Mr. Dobbs at 9 p.m. drew an average of about 400,000 viewers a day.\n\nMs. Behar has appeared on \"The View,\" the popular ABC daytime talk show, since its inception in 1997. She said she had recently signed a new contract with the program.\n\nMs. Behar has filled in for Larry King on CNN with some regularity in recent months, including on Monday night. Soon Ms. Behar will compete with Mr. King at 9 p.m.\n\nOn some days, HLN averages more young viewers in prime time than CNN does, but the company plays down any sense of competition because they both contribute to the revenue of Time Warner, which owns Turner.\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "'The View' Has Narrowed\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nGuest Essay\n\nBy Megan K. Stack\n\nContributing Opinion Writer\n\nThe ladies of \"The View\" were in high spirits. A piece of news they'd been hankering for had broken at last: President Biden, a revered figure around their talk show table, had kicked off his re-election campaign.\n\nThe show's hosts - known in \"View\" parlance as \"the ladies\" - had been hyping this moment for months. They'd lavished praise on President Biden for leading the country out of the pandemic and overseeing what they described as a thriving U.S. economy. They'd downplayed scandals and investigations involving Mr. Biden and his family members. They'd also taken extraordinary pains to disqualify as \"ageist\" questions of whether he is simply too old to run again. Mr. Biden would be 86 by the end of a second term, but when the Democratic strategist David Axelrod expressed mild concern , the comedian Joy Behar snapped that he \"should keep his mouth shut.\"\n\n\"I'd rather have Joe Biden, drooling, than any Republican,\" Ms. Behar said another day.\n\nNow the ladies agreed that Mr. Biden's campaign announcement made them feel hopeful. They were tired of what Sunny Hostin called Republican \"fearmongering,\" which, in a startlingly casual aside, she noted had \"led to the demise of our democracy.\" If any of the ladies was perturbed by the paradox of decrying scare tactics while calling U.S. democracy dead, she kept it to herself.\n\n\"You get behind him,\" the actress Whoopi Goldberg said of Mr. Biden, seemingly instructing the Democrats at large, \"and we won't have a problem.\"\n\nThis kind of unabashed cheerleading is reserved for Mr. Biden. The panel of \"View\" hosts has been annoyed and dismissive of other Democrats who might vie for the nomination. (\"You start making inroads - maybe this person , maybe this person - we're done for,\" Ms. Goldberg said.) When compelled to discuss the Twitter-hosted presidential campaign announcement of Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida - a man they'd decried as \"fascist,\" \"bigot\" and \"Death Santis\" - the ladies used the occasion to mock the platform and its new owner, Elon Musk, for the tech failures that disrupted the event. As for Mr. Trump, forget about it: Ms. Goldberg won't even utter his name, referring to him instead as \"you know who.\"\n\nThe day after Mr. Biden's announcement, the co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin, a Republican political operative who'd already been silenced by Ms. Goldberg, giggled from her end of the table. Ms. Farah Griffin has said she'd write in another candidate before voting for either Mr. Biden or Mr. Trump, but her counterpoints tend to get interrupted or dismissed by the rest of the panel.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "Joy Behar Roasts Chris Christie\n\nIn my recent piece about New Jersey Governor Chris Christie , I described an incident that occurred last week:\n\nOn April 1st, Chris Christie, the beleaguered Republican governor of New Jersey, attended a celebrity roast, in Newark, to celebrate the ninetieth birthday of Brendan Byrne, the state's governor from 1974 to 1982. \"He's an inspiration,\" Christie told the audience, referring to Byrne, who won reëlection against long odds, because he has \"shown that political comebacks can actually happen.\"\n\nChristie sat on a long dais with five former governors and five local comedians, listening to the guitarist John Pizzarelli sing an ode to the state: \"I may leave for a week or two, but I'm always coming back.\" Christie was seated next to former Governor Thomas Kean, a longtime supporter, but he did not say hello or shake his hand, and he glared at the comedians as they delivered their lines. \"You scare the shit out of me,\" Stewie Stone said to Christie during his routine....\n\nJoy Behar, the former co-host of \"The View,\" was even more pointed. \"When I first heard that he was accused of blocking off three lanes on the bridge, I said, 'What the hell is he doing, standing in the middle of the bridge?' \" After another barb, Christie interrupted her. \"This is a Byrne roast,\" he said. He stood up and tried to grab her notes. The audience laughed awkwardly. \"Stop bullying me,\" Behar said as he sat down. Christie said something out of earshot and Behar responded, \"Why don't you get up here at the microphone instead of being such a coward?\" Christie stood up again and moved in front of the lectern as Behar retreated. \"At least I don't get paid for this,\" he said.\n\nChristie sat down and Behar continued, though she was noticeably rattled. \"I really don't know about the Presidency,\" she said. \"Let me put it to you this way, in a way that you'd appreciate: You're toast.\"\n\nHere's a video of the Behar-Christie exchange that I took with an iPhone from the back of the room. After the show, Behar told me the confrontation was tense. \"He was not happy with my performance,\" she said. \"He's touchy.\" Her husband, Steve Janowitz, added, \"He lost it.\"\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "\"The View\" Mellows Out\n\n\"I've always wanted to do a show with women of different generations, backgrounds, and views,\" Barbara Walters said once upon a time. It was 1997, and Walters's voice-over accompanied the opening credits of \"The View,\" a new daytime talk show on ABC. The panelists convened that first season represented archetypes of the modern woman: there was Meredith Vieira, the genial working mom; Star Jones, the black urban professional; Joy Behar, the zany-aunt comic relief; and Debbie Matenopoulos, the blond twentysomething (since apparently eaten by wolves). Presiding over the table talk was Walters herself, in the role of doyenne, news veteran, and, occasionally, square.\n\nThat \"The View\" is now entering its eighteenth season attests to the strength of its format, which aims to reproduce the casual but spirited chitchat of its target audience: women who are home at 11 A.M. For a long time, the show walked a line between the pull of clashing viewpoints and the comfort of daytime kibitzing, but mostly it was about personalities, which got bigger and tenser over the years. This was mainly because of the exits and entrances of the co-hosts, and the related infusion of politics, both internal and national. The sudden departure of Star Jones caused a public rift between her and Walters. (She had been fired, but announced the news on air without warning.) Elisabeth Hasselbeck, who succeeded Matenopoulos and Lisa Ling, turned the token young person's slot into the token conservative's. But the biggest upheaval came with Rosie O'Donnell, who brought an aggressive tone, feuding with Donald Trump and sparring with Hasselbeck over the Iraq War. On a show that aspired to bring together women of all types, O'Donnell pushed the limits of what cheery daytime chatter could sustain, and \"The View\" became more heated and more interesting as a result. It seemed as if the country had grown too contentious for the civil kaffeeklatsch Walters had envisioned. The O'Donnell-Hasselbeck battles climaxed on May 23, 2007, with a riveting split-screen brawl in which O'Donnell accused Hasselbeck of cowardice and Hasselbeck accused O'Donnell of browbeating. (O'Donnell, who was already planning to leave, quit immediately.) By 2007, the show had enough drama under its belt to merit an \"E! True Hollywood Story.\" Some people began calling it a soap opera (a touch of misogyny there), but it was more like a workplace drama, with its conflicting personalities, barely suppressed friction, and revolving personnel.\n\nYesterday, the show began its next phase, with a new set and a newish cast, under a new executive producer, Bill Wolff (replacing Bill Geddie). Walters has handed the keys to her younger counterparts, while two of last year's co-hosts, Sherri Shepherd and Jenny McCarthy, have also left. (McCarthy, most notable for her opposition to childhood vaccination, was a one-season misstep; Shepherd may be best remembered for her uncertainty over whether the Earth is round.) A well-publicized casting search this past summer yielded a formidable lineup: Whoopi Goldberg, Rosie Perez, Nicolle Wallace (a former communications chief for George W. Bush and a senior adviser to the McCain-Palin campaign), and, not a moment too soon, Rosie O'Donnell, who began her first show back by explaining that she was sitting cross-legged and barefoot because of her sciatica. Nice to see you again, too!\n\nThe episode kicked off with a changing of the guard, as all four women kissed the ring of Barbara Walters, who sat on a throne. (\"I was told I'd have a crown,\" she said, eyes wide.) Then the cameras revealed the new set, which looks like blueberry yogurt: all pleasant whites and blues, accented with jazzy throw pillows. Goldberg complained that the table was too small, but otherwise struck a tone of measured optimism. \"Some of it will work and some of it won't, but the thing that never changes on 'The View' is it's great conversation with great women,\" she said.\n\nIt was watchable conversation with cannily selected women, who were on their best behavior. They quickly moved on to the \"hot topics,\" which included domestic violence in sports, the deaths of Robin Williams and Joan Rivers, Hillary Clinton's return to Iowa, and a viral video of a dad playing peekaboo. For a cast that had only been finalized ten days before, they gelled pretty well. Goldberg, who has moderated the show since O'Donnell's exit, seemed the most comfortable, saying that she was back \"like bad gas\" and sharing pictures of her great-granddaughter, who is named, astoundingly, Charlie Rose. Perez, who has the least broadcast experience of the four, seemed nervous, but her natural charisma was evident, and the show was overdue for a Latina voice (emphasis on voice ). Wallace, another smart casting choice, was a bit on the defensive, introducing herself by saying, \"I'm a Republican. We should get that out of the way.\" But she seems to have won the respect of her liberal co-hosts by virtue of hating Sarah Palin, whose name Goldberg couldn't even say without laughing. (Perez: \"When did you want to just pop her?\")\n\nO'Donnell, meanwhile, seemed determined to shake her rep as the loose cannon. \"I really like her, I swear to God!\" she said of Wallace. Since her last time on \"The View,\" she told us, she has a new marriage and a new baby, and has lost fifty pounds after surviving a heart attack. If \"The View\" were indeed a soap opera, she would be playing the part of the woman presumed dead who shows up unexpectedly at the doorstep-only she isn't out for revenge. During a trivia game called \"Ro or Ro?,\" she put Perez at ease, and there were echoes of the super-nice O'Donnell from her nineties talk show. In an era when female backbiting has overwhelmed reality television, a calmer, more substantial \"View\" may not be the worst thing. But what it needs, short of melodrama, is edge-the kind that makes O'Donnell, at her most unvarnished, so compelling to watch. Perhaps, as the new hosts settle in, they'll start poking holes in their prescribed roles. For now, the tone was like that of a tasteful luncheon. As the credits rolled, the cast went in for a group hug. Queen Barbara would approve.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Joy Behar Is Right: Chris Christie is \"Toast\"\n\nWhatever else you do this week, carve out half an hour to read my colleague Ryan Lizza's piece about Chris Christie and New Jersey politics. It's Robert Penn Warren meets Carl Hiaasen on the west bank of the Hudson. By the time you get to the end of it, I bet you'll find yourself asking the same question I did: How could we ever have taken this bully seriously as a Presidential candidate?\n\nIn an era when elected officials are about as popular as burglars and bank C.E.O.s, the answer is that Christie cleverly created a public persona as a plain-talking, non-ideological Honest Joe-an anti-politician, almost-and the media, or much of it, went along with the spin. Even President Obama, by embracing Christie on the Jersey Shore shortly after Hurricane Sandy struck, contributed to Christie's image as a decent man stuck in a bad profession and a nutty party. (Obama had his own motivations, of course; in the last stages of a Presidential race, he was eager to be seen reaching across partisan lines and dealing with the storm.)\n\nThanks to the Bridgegate scandal, and the torrent of e-mails, internal documents, and unvarnished interviews it unleashed, we have been able to see the real Christie, and it isn't an edifying sight. It's so ugly, in fact, that Christie will almost certainly not survive its public display. \"I really don't know about the Presidency,\" Joy Behar, the former co-host of \"The View,\" said to Christie at a recent political roast in Newark, which Ryan recounts in his piece. \"Let me put it to you this way, in a way that you'd appreciate: You're toast.\" Behar may have been joking: she is a comedienne. But, with a federal grand jury busy hauling in Christie's aides to explain what they know about the Bridgegate scandal, there can't be many people who disagree with her analysis.\n\nOn the basis of what we've seen over the past few weeks, what we have here is not some tribune of the common man with a sharp political brain. It's a dark, Nixonian character who plots and rages, who ruthlessly exploits his office for political ends, who intimidates opponents and colleagues alike, who publicly trashes his former aides when he deems it necessary, and who even double-crosses his oldest allies.\n\nWhen the bridge scandal broke, Christie's response was to stonewall. That strategy outlived its usefulness once a state assembly committee got hold of a batch of e-mails between the Governor's staff and officials at the Port Authority, one of which said, \"Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.\" Switching to Plan B, Christie turned against some of his closest aides and allies, including the author of the infamous e-mail, his former deputy chief of staff, Bridget Anne Kelly, and David Wildstein, the former Port Authority official and Christie's childhood friend, who received Kelly's e-mail and ordered the lane closures.\n\nFiring Kelly and fingering Wildstein, who had already resigned, were predictable moves, but Christie didn't stop there. First, the Governor trashed Wildstein's character, suggesting, among other things, that he was a nobody in high school. His office circulated a statement describing Wildstein as an unscrupulous person who was even accused of deceptive behavior by his social-studies teacher. A couple of weeks ago, it was Kelly's turn to receive the Christie treatment. A supposedly independent report-commissioned by the Governor at the taxpayers' expense-claimed that she and Wildstein acted alone , revealed embarrassing details about her personal life, and even raised questions about her mental state.\n\nThese were low, low moves, and it's not even clear they worked to Christie's advantage. The report that slimed Kelly and cleared Christie was so obviously a whitewash that it was subjected to widespread ridicule. An attorney acting for Kelly, Michael Critchley, aptly described it as venomous, gratuitous, and sexist, noting, \"Ms. Kelly's evidence could be critical to verifying either of the two competing versions of events. A pre-emptive strike to isolate Ms. Kelly and impugn her credibility is not surprising.\"\n\nThere have been reports that Kelly is seeking immunity from prosecution in order to coöperate with Paul Fishman, the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, whose staff is looking into the scandal. It looks like Wildstein is already singing to the Feds. An article on the Web site Main Justice says he spent much of last week \"camped\" at Fishman's office, talking to investigators. Wildstein has reportedly claimed that he told Christie about the lane closures way back in September, when traffic on the George Washington Bridge was still snarled. The Governor's aides have intimated that he doesn't recall any such conversation.\n\nOn Friday, one of Christie's longtime aides, Michael Drewniak, gave testimony to the grand jury. (He is not a target, his attorney told ABC News.) According to some reports, the criminal investigation could take up to eighteen months. With all this hanging over the Governor, it seems almost inconceivable that he would plunge into a Presidential campaign. If he did, he would be inviting attacks not just from Democrats but from some Republicans as well, and particularly from Thomas Kean, Sr., the former Republican Governor of the state, who for many years served as Christie's mentor and close adviser.\n\nLast year, for reasons that remain murky, Christie turned against Kean's son, Thomas Kean, Jr., who was running for reëlection as the minority leader in the New Jersey state senate. Despite the Governor's opposition, Kean, Jr., won the vote, but he and his father did not forgive and forget. In January, after Christie, in a two-hour press conference, denied knowing anything about the lane closures, the senior Kean went on MSNBC and said that, while he believed Christie, \"I think there are still unanswered questions\" about why his appointees did what they did. In an interview with Ryan, Kean went further, asking whether Christie had \"created an atmosphere in which some of those people thought they were doing his will because they were getting back at people.\" He added, \"If you cross Christie, he'll come back at you, even years later. So his people might have picked up that kind of thing.\"\n\nThis, remember, is Christie's former friend and sponsor-a man who has known him since he was a teen-ager, who gave him his start in politics, and who wrote to President George W. Bush to support his 2002 appointment as the United States Attorney for New Jersey, the post he used as a springboard to the governorship. If Christie can't get Kean and others who know him well to vouch for him, how is he going to get the support of his fellow Republicans, let alone independents and Democrats? He isn't. And that, I would guess, is what Behar was trying to explain to him.\n\nPhotograph: Julio Cortez/AP\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Ann Romney's View\n\n\"Explain that to me,\" Barbara Walters said to Ann Romney , who had just said something that has needed a bit of explaining, about her husband's changing position on abortion at the stage in his career when Massachusetts voters mattered-and also about why, in her view, people should stop asking. \"The good news is, I'm not running for office and I don't have to say what I feel! But I am pro-life. I'm happy to say that. Mitt has always been a pro-life person . He governed, when he ran, as, um, pro-choice.\" It was, she said, \"a tender, tender issue\"-but not that this was anything to vote about:\n\nWomen are going to have a choice. I mean, it's clear. If you really want to make a choice and if those choices are about reproductive rights, that's your choice. If they're about economic issues and making a better future for your children and making sure that we have this-and that's the beauty of what we have in this country, is being able to have those choices.\n\nIt is hard to say which is more glaring here, the evasiveness, or the dismissiveness. Ann Romney is saying that if you care-and vote-about reproductive rights, then you don't care about \"a better future for your children\" (and one might in fact think that Obama is better on the economy). Does that include daughters whose lives might be constrained, or whose health might be threatened? When Joy Behar asked Ann if reproductive health might also be an economic issue, she reverted to the stance of the wife who doesn't have to say: \"You know, again, I would love it if you'd get my husband on the couch, Joy.\" That might be useful. (He was supposed to be there, but had cancelled.) Mitt Romney's position is that abortion should not be allowed except in cases of rape or incest (and how would a woman or girl be asked to prove that?), or if the mother would actually die. More remarkably, he has been trying to present that as a non-extreme position because it includes a few exceptions.\n\nBut at another moment Ann Romney's restraint, it has to be said, served her well. There have been a lot of missed chances in this campaign, and one was for Americans to learn more about Mormonism, a faith whose history is wrapped up, in a way few others are, with that of this country. That hasn't happened-something Whoopi Goldberg made painfully clear, in an exchange in which she seemed to have mistaken Mormon for some sort of mountain-state version of Quakers:\n\nWHOOPI GOLDBERG: As First Lady, if you get the job, it's going to entail a lot of things, and one of those things is going to be talking to the mothers whose children are coming home in bags, you know, from wars. Now, I know-I believe that your religion doesn't allow you to go fight.\n\nANN ROMNEY: No, that's not correct. We have many, many members of our faith that are serving in armed services.\n\nGoldberg, need it be said, was flatly wrong, and probably owed Romney an apology. Couldn't someone have looked that up before the show? There are plenty of questions one can ask about Mormonism-and can do so reasonably, given how large a part the faith plays both in the Romneys' private life and in what they have offered as their community commitments-including hard questions about race. But at least check the basic facts first. The clumsiness also meant that the other question Goldberg wanted to ask-about the Vietnam deferrals Romney got thanks to his mission and student status-got scrambled:\n\nGOLDBERG: O.K., um, I say that because when I read about your husband, what I had read, and maybe you can correct this, is that the reason that he didn't serve in Vietnam was because it was against the religion. That's what I read.\n\nROMNEY: No, that's not correct. He was serving his mission and you know my five sons have also served missions. None served in the military. None served in the military, but I do have one son that feels that he's giving back to his country in a significant way where he is now a doctor and he is taking care of veterans.\n\nAnd so the issue switched from the reasons why her husband had served less than others in his generation-even as he criticized anti-war protesters-to the notion that her sons had done more than other members of theirs.\n\nOne of those sons, Josh, was in the audience. Earlier, his older brother Tagg had been asked on a radio program how it felt to hear the President \"call your dad a liar\": \"Well, jump out of your seat and you want to rush down to the stage and take a swing at him. But you know you can't do that because, well, first because there's a lot of Secret Service between you and him, but also because this is the nature of the process.\" (Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote about why this wasn't all that funny.) \"That brother has slugged me a couple of times,\" Josh said. \"I'm sure President Obama has nothing to worry about.\" Romney humor.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

A supposedly independent report-commissioned by the Governor at the taxpayers' expense-claimed that she and Wildstein acted alone , revealed embarrassing details about her personal life, and even raised questions about her mental state.\n\nThese were low, low moves, and it's not even clear they worked to Christie's advantage. The report that slimed Kelly and cleared Christie was so obviously a whitewash that it was subjected to widespread ridicule. An attorney acting for Kelly, Michael Critchley, aptly described it as venomous, gratuitous, and sexist, noting, \"Ms. Kelly's evidence could be critical to verifying either of the two competing versions of events. A pre-emptive strike to isolate Ms. Kelly and impugn her credibility is not surprising.\"\n\nThere have been reports that Kelly is seeking immunity from prosecution in order to coöperate with Paul Fishman, the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, whose staff is looking into the scandal. It looks like Wildstein is already singing to the Feds. An article on the Web site Main Justice says he spent much of last week \"camped\" at Fishman's office, talking to investigators. Wildstein has reportedly claimed that he told Christie about the lane closures way back in September, when traffic on the George Washington Bridge was still snarled. The Governor's aides have intimated that he doesn't recall any such conversation.\n\nOn Friday, one of Christie's longtime aides, Michael Drewniak, gave testimony to the grand jury. (He is not a target, his attorney told ABC News.) According to some reports, the criminal investigation could take up to eighteen months. With all this hanging over the Governor, it seems almost inconceivable that he would plunge into a Presidential campaign. If he did, he would be inviting attacks not just from Democrats but from some Republicans as well, and particularly from Thomas Kean, Sr., the former Republican Governor of the state, who for many years served as Christie's mentor and close adviser.\n\nLast year, for reasons that remain murky, Christie turned against Kean's son, Thomas Kean, Jr., who was running for reëlection as the minority leader in the New Jersey state senate. Despite the Governor's opposition, Kean, Jr., won the vote, but he and his father did not forgive and forget. In January, after Christie, in a two-hour press conference, denied knowing anything about the lane closures, the senior Kean went on MSNBC and said that, while he believed Christie, \"I think there are still unanswered questions\" about why his appointees did what they did. In an interview with Ryan, Kean went further, asking whether Christie had \"created an atmosphere in which some of those people thought they were doing his will because they were getting back at people.\" He added, \"If you cross Christie, he'll come back at you, even years later. So his people might have picked up that kind of thing.\"\n\nThis, remember, is Christie's former friend and sponsor-a man who has known him since he was a teen-ager, who gave him his start in politics, and who wrote to President George W. Bush to support his 2002 appointment as the United States Attorney for New Jersey, the post he used as a springboard to the governorship. If Christie can't get Kean and others who know him well to vouch for him, how is he going to get the support of his fellow Republicans, let alone independents and Democrats? He isn't. And that, I would guess, is what Behar was trying to explain to him.\n\nPhotograph: Julio Cortez/AP\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Julie Chen-Moonves and the Meaning of a Wife's Loyalty\n\nWhat's in a name? For Julie Chen, the CBS personality, who is married to Leslie Moonves, it is a code of fealty. Earlier this month, four days after Moonves resigned from his position as the chairman of CBS, following multiple allegations of workplace sexual abuse, Chen made known, in no uncertain terms, the degree of her marital commitment: \"I'm Julie Chen-Moonves. Good night,\" she said at the end of the September 14th episode of \"Big Brother,\" the reality-TV competition that she has hosted for CBS since 2000.\n\nThe sign-off, which Chen repeated on Wednesday, her second day back on the show, gave her return to television duties a defiant edge. Chen and Moonves first became involved in the early two-thousands, when Moonves was still married to his first wife. They wed in 2004, but Chen used only her maiden name at work, and casual viewers of her shows would not necessarily have known of her connection to the network's head. Her persona on \"Big Brother,\" and on CBS's \"The Talk,\" the women's daytime panel show that she anchored from 2010 until her departure, this month, has depended on an assertive froideur. Quasi-journalistic, Chen plays the glamorous moderator, analyzing cultural flash points but rarely entering the fray. Her new flare of passion suggests that she has now found a cause. A source close to her told CNN that Chen \"has decided that her main focus needs to be clearing her husband's name.\" (In a statement announcing his resignation from CBS, Moonves called the allegations \"untrue\" and \"not consistent with who I am.\")\n\nThe humiliations of a wife who \"stands by\" her husband are well known to Americans, but the momentum of #MeToo has made the role particularly vexed. A wife whose husband has behaved badly is presumed to be a conscious or unconscious accomplice, a delusional victim, or, most injuriously, a fool. How did she not know? The sexism of our culture still makes it beyond comprehension that we could hold a man accountable for his misdeeds without also doling out some blame to the caretakers around him, who we believe should be responsible for his moral maintenance. \"It feels very unjust,\" Rebecca Traister wrote in her excellent 2016 essay \" Why Should Wives Have to Answer for Their Husbands' Behavior ?\" \"But for wives, answering for a husband's misdeeds has long been part of the bargain.\" Yet it also seems too simple, in this moment, to unilaterally blame male influence for the maneuvers of women who choose to use their voices to invalidate those of other women. The public-facing loyalty of the abuser's wife destabilizes the #MeToo movement's core vision-that women should be able to speak and be believed.\n\nUnlike Georgina Chapman, who filed for divorce from Harvey Weinstein after last year's torrent of exposés , or Melania Trump, who barely seems to register the sexual-misconduct accusations against her husband, Chen has come out, unequivocally and proactively, in support of Moonves. \"Right now, I need to spend more time at home with my husband and son,\" she said, during a pretaped farewell message that aired on her final episode of \"The Talk,\" last week. On Twitter, she has called Moonves \"a good man and a loving father, devoted husband and inspiring corporate leader\" and a \"kind, decent, and moral human being.\" And it may seem this way, from her vantage point. One thornier aspect of #MeToo consciousness-raising involves convincing not just men but other women that they might not know everything about a man they know well-that nearness does not guarantee transparency, that a man who is evil during the day might be patient when he returns home at night, that the powerful can apply a vile and discriminating calculus to who will suffer abuse and who will not. (This is what is so useless about the statement signed by sixty-five female acquaintances of the embattled Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, calling him a \"good person.\")\n\n\"Patriarchy has no gender,\" bell hooks wrote. Traister, writing about Camille Cosby and Hillary Clinton defending their husbands, identified \"how the length of some public marriages means that they must comprise and account for dramatic shifts in cultural assumptions about gender, sex, and power.\" Chen, at forty-eight years old, is of a different, purportedly more progressive generation. She was born in Queens, and became enamored with evening news shows as a child. She first arrived at CBS, as an intern, in 1990, five years before Moonves joined. She returned in 1999, as an anchor for \"CBS Morning News.\" Unlike Camille Cosby, Chen has a robust public identity; unlike Hillary Clinton, she was not forced to assume her husband's last name in her professional life. Chen and Moonves enjoy a modern strain of union in which the wife is permitted to have loud charisma and ambition, and a measure of independence. And yet, almost overnight, the modern-seeming marriage shows us its archaic bones. It is Chen who has so far been the mouthpiece for defending Moonves's reputation, and it may be she who will broker a future rehabilitation campaign.\n\nChen can continue hosting \"Big Brother,\" because it is a show that shuts off the outside world. There, she can exist as a pretaped master of ceremonies, commiserating with evicted contestants, reviewing surveillance feeds with the tittering in-studio audience. \"The Talk,\" which films live, does not allow this sort of detachment. It trades on caffeine and opinions, on civil disagreement and innocuous gossip painlessly intertwined. Before Chen's departure, Joy Behar, a host of \"The View,\" observed that Chen's personal life might be interfering with \"The Talk\" 's vaguely feminist atmosphere. \"What topics can they do?\" Behar said. \"They can't talk about the #MeToo movement without her coming clean about her husband.\" During Chen's hiatus in September, her co-hosts extended good will toward her, but wondered aloud about the network's slowness to address the terror that Moonves allegedly inflicted on the workplace culture. \"The Talk,\" like other female-centric talk shows, is the product of the sentimental notion that all women can ultimately cast away their differences in the service of natural sorority. In the video announcing her exit, Chen's voice cracked as she spoke of the \"sisterhood\" between herself and her fellow-hosts. The panel had a palpable chemistry. Now Chen is choosing a prior engagement.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Joy Behar Roasts Chris Christie\n\nIn my recent piece about New Jersey Governor Chris Christie , I described an incident that occurred last week:\n\nOn April 1st, Chris Christie, the beleaguered Republican governor of New Jersey, attended a celebrity roast, in Newark, to celebrate the ninetieth birthday of Brendan Byrne, the state's governor from 1974 to 1982. \"He's an inspiration,\" Christie told the audience, referring to Byrne, who won reëlection against long odds, because he has \"shown that political comebacks can actually happen.\"\n\nChristie sat on a long dais with five former governors and five local comedians, listening to the guitarist John Pizzarelli sing an ode to the state: \"I may leave for a week or two, but I'm always coming back.\" Christie was seated next to former Governor Thomas Kean, a longtime supporter, but he did not say hello or shake his hand, and he glared at the comedians as they delivered their lines. \"You scare the shit out of me,\" Stewie Stone said to Christie during his routine....\n\nJoy Behar, the former co-host of \"The View,\" was even more pointed. \"When I first heard that he was accused of blocking off three lanes on the bridge, I said, 'What the hell is he doing, standing in the middle of the bridge?' \" After another barb, Christie interrupted her. \"This is a Byrne roast,\" he said. He stood up and tried to grab her notes. The audience laughed awkwardly. \"Stop bullying me,\" Behar said as he sat down. Christie said something out of earshot and Behar responded, \"Why don't you get up here at the microphone instead of being such a coward?\" Christie stood up again and moved in front of the lectern as Behar retreated. \"At least I don't get paid for this,\" he said.\n\nChristie sat down and Behar continued, though she was noticeably rattled. \"I really don't know about the Presidency,\" she said. \"Let me put it to you this way, in a way that you'd appreciate: You're toast.\"\n\nHere's a video of the Behar-Christie exchange that I took with an iPhone from the back of the room. After the show, Behar told me the confrontation was tense. \"He was not happy with my performance,\" she said. \"He's touchy.\" Her husband, Steve Janowitz, added, \"He lost it.\"\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "Announcing MyIlluminati\n\nWhen people think of the Illuminati, they tend to think big-picture-new world order, secret society, headquarters under the Denver International Airport, that kind of thing. It's totally understandable. We are everywhere. Our logo is on every dollar. Our spy planes leave chemtrails over both land and sea. We are currently grooming Blue Ivy to be the cutest shape-shifting reptilian World Monarch ever .\n\nOther organizations must wonder, \"How do the Illuminati find time to control all the sheeple?\" Well, here's the secret: day to day, we work at a granular scale. There is so much we do, and so much more we could do-and that's where you come in. We have enough eyes in the sky; we need boots on the ground.\n\nSo it is with great pleasure that we introduce MyIlluminati: a vast, lively splinter network that allows you-yes, even you!-to get involved with the Illuminati, at the local level. You may be wondering, \"Is MyIlluminati a pyramid scheme?\" Absolutely. We are very upfront about shamelessly stealing your energy, money, plasma, thick sweaters for outer space, and what have you. As the great Illuminati band the New Radicals once sang, \"You only get what you give.\"\n\nAnother frequent question is \"Will I gain access to global wealth and knowledge?\" No. That's for Queen Elizabeth and current World Monarch Joy Behar only. However, you will have access to a lot of like-minded people, most of whom want to worship Lucifer openly, without the guilt. Interested in joining?\n\nHere are some fun MyIlluminati activities:\n\nBUNKER MAINTENANCE: We have a lot of bunkers, and let's just say that they don't clean themselves. Bunker detail isn't all Windex and drudgery, though. Design-inclined members have tackled outdated décor. Social butterflies have lunched with Saddam Hussein and Michael Jackson, both very much alive and starved for human connection.\n\nTHE HAARP PROGRAM: Our machines, which manipulate the ionosphere, are pretty important-the big ones control weather patterns, earthquakes, and Internet think-piece trends. But one of our Q4 initiatives is HAARP localization. For a few nights each month, you'll gather with some MyIlluminati buddies and install smaller machines in cell-phone towers. These devices will control eye twitches, arousal, and Presidential-primary vote-casting.\n\nCUSTOM FRAMING: A nice chunk of Illuminati fund-raising comes from controlling the world's banks. But our most ingenious profit center is custom framing. Wood and glass are the cheapest materials on planet Earth. All we have to do is let the sheeple bring in their crappy art, charge them hundreds of dollars, and then make them wait not a day, not a week, but a month for pickup. It makes no sense, and yet it works. (Another scam of ours is dry cleaning.) Please clear your calendar for mandatory volunteer hours.\n\nSPREADING THE WORD: Distributing pamphlets is a great way to explore your town and blow some minds. Stacks of grainy photocopies depicting a flame-eyed Barack Obama whispering in Joy Behar's ear are just waiting to be slipped into laminate sleeves and waved about at Sbarros, bus stations, and twenty-four-hour Rite Aids.\n\nMEDIA CONTROL: MyIlluminati isn't just a social group; it can lead to an exciting new career. We live in a golden age of cable news. As our programming has proliferated-with shows like \"Fox & Friends,\" \"Mad Money,\" all of the History Channel, and the Teen Choice Awards-so has the importance of writers and producers to help broadcast misinformation at such an entertaining clip.\n\nSo join MyIlluminati, where having fun is an inside job!\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "Joy Behar Is Right: Chris Christie is \"Toast\"\n\nWhatever else you do this week, carve out half an hour to read my colleague Ryan Lizza's piece about Chris Christie and New Jersey politics. It's Robert Penn Warren meets Carl Hiaasen on the west bank of the Hudson. By the time you get to the end of it, I bet you'll find yourself asking the same question I did: How could we ever have taken this bully seriously as a Presidential candidate?\n\nIn an era when elected officials are about as popular as burglars and bank C.E.O.s, the answer is that Christie cleverly created a public persona as a plain-talking, non-ideological Honest Joe-an anti-politician, almost-and the media, or much of it, went along with the spin. Even President Obama, by embracing Christie on the Jersey Shore shortly after Hurricane Sandy struck, contributed to Christie's image as a decent man stuck in a bad profession and a nutty party. (Obama had his own motivations, of course; in the last stages of a Presidential race, he was eager to be seen reaching across partisan lines and dealing with the storm.)\n\nThanks to the Bridgegate scandal, and the torrent of e-mails, internal documents, and unvarnished interviews it unleashed, we have been able to see the real Christie, and it isn't an edifying sight. It's so ugly, in fact, that Christie will almost certainly not survive its public display. \"I really don't know about the Presidency,\" Joy Behar, the former co-host of \"The View,\" said to Christie at a recent political roast in Newark, which Ryan recounts in his piece. \"Let me put it to you this way, in a way that you'd appreciate: You're toast.\" Behar may have been joking: she is a comedienne. But, with a federal grand jury busy hauling in Christie's aides to explain what they know about the Bridgegate scandal, there can't be many people who disagree with her analysis.\n\nOn the basis of what we've seen over the past few weeks, what we have here is not some tribune of the common man with a sharp political brain. It's a dark, Nixonian character who plots and rages, who ruthlessly exploits his office for political ends, who intimidates opponents and colleagues alike, who publicly trashes his former aides when he deems it necessary, and who even double-crosses his oldest allies.\n\nWhen the bridge scandal broke, Christie's response was to stonewall. That strategy outlived its usefulness once a state assembly committee got hold of a batch of e-mails between the Governor's staff and officials at the Port Authority, one of which said, \"Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.\" Switching to Plan B, Christie turned against some of his closest aides and allies, including the author of the infamous e-mail, his former deputy chief of staff, Bridget Anne Kelly, and David Wildstein, the former Port Authority official and Christie's childhood friend, who received Kelly's e-mail and ordered the lane closures.\n\nFiring Kelly and fingering Wildstein, who had already resigned, were predictable moves, but Christie didn't stop there. First, the Governor trashed Wildstein's character, suggesting, among other things, that he was a nobody in high school. His office circulated a statement describing Wildstein as an unscrupulous person who was even accused of deceptive behavior by his social-studies teacher. A couple of weeks ago, it was Kelly's turn to receive the Christie treatment. A supposedly independent report-commissioned by the Governor at the taxpayers' expense-claimed that she and Wildstein acted alone , revealed embarrassing details about her personal life, and even raised questions about her mental state.\n\nThese were low, low moves, and it's not even clear they worked to Christie's advantage. The report that slimed Kelly and cleared Christie was so obviously a whitewash that it was subjected to widespread ridicule.

      "text": "Not \"Just a Nurse\"\n\nPhoto by Thinkstock\n\nThe View 's Joy Behar made a surprisingly ignorant comment about nurses this week during a discussion of the Miss America pageant. Miss Colorado (Kelley Johnson), dressed in scrubs and wearing a stethoscope around her neck, gave a heartfelt monologue about her work as a registered nurse. Behar was incredulous, asking why the nurse was \"wearing a doctor's stethoscope.\" Behar apologized the next day , but not before the #NursesUnite hashtag had caught fire on Twitter and the American Nurses Association had issued a sharp rebuke; advertisers Johnson & Johnson and Eggland's Best have also pulled advertising from The View.\n\nI'm a registered nurse, and I can confirm that RNs wear and use stethoscopes for the same reasons doctors do: to listen to patients' hearts, lungs, and bowels. The stethoscopes I buy for work are not divided into \"nurse\" brands and \"doctor\" brands. The problem with Behar's quip, though, isn't that it's dumb (although it is!), but that it's revealing of a persistent misapprehension of how health care actually works. We can't fix our broken health care system if we don't understand it.\n\nStrangely enough, Kelley Johnson's own monologue tapped into this misunderstanding. In the story she told she kept describing herself as \"just a nurse\"-as in, she couldn't order different medications for the patient because she isn't a physician. In her monologue, her patient calls her out for repeatedly diminishing the value of her job, telling Johnson that she would never be \"just a nurse.\"\n\nThe phrase \"just a nurse\" has a long history in nursing and grates on most of us. But the examples Kelley Johnson gave in her monologue highlight a true difference between doctors and nurses: Doctors prescribe and diagnose, and we don't. That means that in many people's minds, nurses' work is somehow always subsumed into doctors' work, to the point that the tools we use-such stethoscopes-end up being perceived as property of doctors.\n\nBut if the women of The View are going to mock nurse Kelley Johnson, it seems worthwhile to delineate key elements of nurses' work. First off, nurses are present . Doctors aren't the ones calming a frightened patient at 3 a.m. or holding a basin while a patient vomits at 3 p.m. Doctors usually aren't the ones sounding the alarm when a patient starts going downhill fast-that's what nurses do, because we're there on the ward and it's part of our job. It's almost always nurses medicating and comforting patients who are dying. It's almost always nurses soothing distraught family members.\n\nSecond, nurses and doctors actually have shared responsibility for patients. Doctors write the orders, but nurses are the ones who actually carry those orders out, and that process carries its own ethical burdens. I have sat in a patient's room, dressed head to toe in latex, slowly injecting a very toxic chemotherapy drug into a patient's IV line that goes straight into a major vein. The process requires 30 minutes of careful observation of the rate of injection and the patient's status. If the patient suffers ill effects from the drug, in a sense I am the agent of that suffering.\n\nFinally, part of any nurse's job is to keep doctors accountable. We learn in school that we are the \"final check\" on all physician orders; that's an obligation we take very seriously. I was a new nurse the day I was double-checking a chemotherapy order and realized that the ordering physician had written it based not on the intravenous dosing of the drug, but the intrathecal dosing-the lower dosing that goes into the brain. I took the order to the doc and noted the discrepancy. Before I could explain that I was new and might have misunderstood, he snatched the order away from me and said, \"I'll fix it.\"\n\nThis is all in a day's work, and in general nurses are not looking for undue recognition-they just want credit where credit is due. There's a kind of humility built into the nursing profession, but our essentialness is quite real, and needs to be recognized if we really want our health care system to be the best it can be, Scott Walker's views of nurses notwithstanding . Discussions about nurses' work environment, nurse staffing, the ubiquity of bullying (doctors against nurses, nurses against each other) in hospitals-they're all seen as peripheral to real discussions of what plagues health care. That needs to change. Whether you call nurses the backbone of our health care system or the spokes in the hospital wheel, strength only comes from strength, and our policy makers-and our cultural commentators-need to understand that and take nurses' professional needs seriously.\n\nOne day, I would love to see an inversion of Kelley Johnson's story: A patient asks a physician a question, and the doctor responds, \"Oh, I'm just a doctor. You'll want to ask the person who takes care of you 24/7-your nurse.\"\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "\"Elisabeth, Calm Down, Dear\"\n\nIn August 2006, the Food and Drug Administration was considering whether emergency contraception should be sold over the counter, and The View was ready to be a part of the debate . The show's creator, Barbara Walters, set up the segment that morning from the head of the drop-leaf table at the center of her imitation living-room set. Elisabeth Hasselbeck, the table's token conservative, was first to respond. \"My heart is, like, almost out of my chest right now,\" she began. \"To me, it's the same as birthing a baby and leaving it out in the street.\" Guest panelist Lisa Loeb tsked: \"Oh, I think that is so extreme. I'm sorry.\" Joy Behar walked through the process of fertilization and implantation, and then Walters jumped back in: \"Let's say it was someone who was raped by a sex pervert.\" The conversation spiraled off into a discussion of exceptions for rape and incest, with Hasselbeck becoming increasingly agitated. \"Elisabeth, calm down, dear,\" Walters cut in again, offering a condescending primer on civilized debate. \"We have to learn how to discuss these things in some sort of rational way.\"\n\nThe dispute was somehow even more of a mess behind the scenes. In Ladies Who Punch: The Explosive Inside Story of The View , entertainment journalist Ramin Setoodeh reports that the topic first came up in the makeup room that morning. Rosie O'Donnell, who was set to join the cast in September, had stopped by to sit in on a meeting that had left Hasselbeck in tears. After the heated on-air debate, Hasselbeck ripped up her notes and stalked offstage. All the women were still wearing microphones, and Setoodeh, who is Variety's New York bureau chief, acquired a recording of what happened next. \"Fuck that!\" Hasselbeck screamed. When a producer found her in her dressing room, she announced she was quitting. But by the time the cameras came back on a few minutes later, Walters and Hasselbeck were beaming and hugging each other at the table. They were professional women, after all, and the audience expected them to make up. They had a show to do.\n\nOne way to look at this on-air debate is that it was a mess. The women stabbed wildly at tangential issues, appealed to emotion, plucked extreme examples to illustrate their points, showed no solid grasp of the political or scientific issues at play, and capped it off with a smug lecture on the importance of rational debate. It was embarrassing, unenlightening chaos.\n\nThis is also a way of looking at The View itself, which has been on the air since 1997. Over the years, co-hosts have mused on air about 9/11 trutherism, the supposed link between vaccines and autism, and whether the Earth is flat. The show treats politics like a soap opera, and blurs the lines between journalism and opinion. \"Nobody wants facts,\" O'Donnell liked to say. \"Everybody wants feelings.\" Meanwhile, as a workplace, it's leakier than the White House, with backstage disputes constantly playing out in the tabloids and reducing professional conflicts to \"catfights\": Star Jones vs. Barbara, Barbara vs. Rosie, Rosie vs. Elisabeth. The View , in both substance and reputation, makes women look like back-stabbing, ill-informed dingbats.\n\nBut here's another way to look at The View . While its daytime rivals peddled paternity-test brawls and soft-focus celebrity interviews, The View was the show that believed that the audience for daytime television-low-income mothers, mostly-could cultivate an interest in politics and policy. It invited senators and presidential candidates to speak to that audience, and made room for women to disagree about everything from the Bush administration to the #MeToo movement. As Setoodeh puts it, the show's \"influence is significant in a way that doesn't usually get said out loud.\"\n\nLadies Who Punch makes both cases, which is exactly right. On the one hand, The View is the show you watch if you want to see a former Survivor contestant debate a former professional wrestler on the morality of waterboarding. On the other hand, it's the daytime show that debated waterboarding.\n\nThe book is divided into three sections, focusing on Walters, O'Donnell, and Whoopi Goldberg, who has been a cast member since 2007 and is portrayed as a steady, sensible presence behind the scenes. A director compares O'Donnell, by contrast, to Pol Pot. But it's Hasselbeck, hired in 2003, who emerges accidentally as perhaps the most important figure in the show's history. Before Hasselbeck's arrival, the show's leaders-including Walters-had resisted letting the show dwell on politics. Bickering pundits were for shows like Crossfire , branded as masculine spaces. But The View 's Republican executive producer, Bill Geddie, realized that some ideological diversity would spice things up. Hasselbeck arrived two years into the Bush presidency, and she transformed the table. Conservative viewers loved her, and liberals loved to hate her. Since then, The View has always had a conservative at the table-currently Meghan McCain-and the sparks they generate have continued to make news.\n\nBy Ramin Setoodeh.

Setoodeh has been reporting on the show for years, and he knows everyone. The book is studded with juicy little scoops, including firing stories, backstage drama (wait for the story about Walters, Jenny McCarthy, and the tampon), and details about Star Jones' freebie-laden wedding. O'Donnell admits to Setoodeh that she had a nonsexual kind of crush on Hasselbeck and speculates that her onetime friend-\"MVP of a Division One softball team\"-may have felt something for her too. Hasselbeck and Goldberg were the only two View cast members who declined Setoodeh's interview requests for Ladies Who Punch . But Hasselbeck is currently promoting her own memoir, and she knows how to keep a news cycle rolling. Appearing on her old show last week, she dismissed the crush talk as \" insulting, disturbing .\" But first, she and some of her old co-hosts took a moment to marvel over what they had built together. \"I love the fact that we have passion,\" Hasselbeck said. \"We can have a debate without hating each other.\"\n\nThe View 's entire brand is discord, both onstage and off. But the show's own metanarrative also fetishizes harmony and feminine solidarity. The women are constantly congratulating themselves over their ability to have civilized debates, even as the tabloids (and Setoodeh) report otherwise. In a way, they're right: Politics is rarely personal on The View , and political disagreements seem to be forgotten as soon as the camera flickers off. Personal disagreements, however, are something different. When Hasselbeck stormed off the set after the contraception segment in 2006, she wasn't mad about her perception that the other panelists wanted to do the equivalent of leaving infants to die on the street. She was angry because Walters had reprimanded her on air. In the end, of course, they made nice for the cameras. Women so often do.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC. All rights reserved."

Before he had even stepped on set, co-host Ana Navarro had called Biden the \"light at the end of the tunnel\" and a \"chance to wake up from this three-year-long national nightmare.\" Meghan McCain went even further before the show was over.* \"I love you so much,\" she told Biden after revisiting a touching moment the two shared on-air a little more than a year ago, after McCain's father was diagnosed with the same type of cancer that killed Biden's adult son in 2015.\n\nBiden needed every bit of that love to save himself from embarrassment.\n\nDuring the course of an hour, Biden stumbled through a series of softball questions, eschewing relevant specifics almost completely and, on occasion, stopping himself short or letting his answers trail off. He also made it clear once again that he is either unwilling or unable to understand the concerns about his history of touching women in ways that make them feel uncomfortable, or the criticism of how he handled the Anita Hill hearings. In Biden's telling, both are simply things that happened, not things he is responsible for.\n\n\"I'm sorry she was treated the way she was treated,\" Biden said of Hill at one point. \"There were a lot of mistakes that were made across the board and for those I apologize.\"\n\nThe exchange about his handsiness, meanwhile, was the show's dynamic in a nutshell:\n\nBiden: I'm really sorry if what I did-in talking to them, trying to console-that in fact, they took it a different way. And it's my responsibility to make sure that I bend over backwards to try to understand how not to do that.\n\nJoy Behar: Nancy Pelosi wants you to say, \"I'm sorry that I invaded your space.\"\n\nBiden: Sorry I invaded your space, I mean-I'm sorry this happened. But I'm not sorry in the sense that I think I did anything that was intentionally designed to do anything wrong or be inappropriate. It was inappropriate that I didn't understand that I took-I assumed-look, I was-anyway.\n\nNavarro: You know what, there's also so many people that in a moment of need-when they needed consolation, when they need encouragement, when they needed a hug-have been happy to get that from Joe Biden who turned his grief into that.\n\nBiden would have continued to flail-or simply sunk in silence-if Navarro hadn't come in with the lifeline. It's worth noting that the View panel, including Behar, were among Biden's loudest defenders earlier this month after Lucy Flores came forward with her story of Biden making her feel uncomfortable. The panel may have pressed Biden harder than he was prepared for, but it was predictable that one of the hosts would come to his rescue.\n\nThe first half of the show was a total love fest. Biden walked out to Bruce Springsteen's \"We Take Care of Our Own,\" which was a mainstay in Barack Obama's 2012 reelection campaign. The co-hosts took turns calling Biden a \"beloved political icon,\" praising his launch video, and marveling at how there wasn't \"one single whisper of scandal\" in Obama's eight years in the White House. The panel also phrased their opening questions in ways that took as a given many things Biden needs primary voters to believe-that Obama would have endorsed Biden if Biden hadn't asked the former POTUS to refrain, that the general election will \"come down to Pennsylvania,\" and that Biden is uniquely well-suited to win over voters there.\n\nEven on the question of Biden's age, the panel used Donald Trump's claim earlier in the day that he's \"young\" and \"vibrant\" in comparison as the vehicle for that criticism, allowing the 76-year-old Biden and the audience to laugh it off. \"Look, if he looks young and vibrant compared to me, I should probably go home,\" Biden said.\n\nStill, Biden failed to inspire even before the questions got harder. While answering an early question about whether he could be a forward-looking candidate given his age, for instance, Biden spoke of curing cancer-an issue close to his heart-and then moved on to touting ... speedy cross-country flights:\n\nThere's so much out there. Think of what this next generation is going to have an opportunity to see. We're going to do everything from make fundamental change in curing cancer and Alzheimer's and diseases. Your kids are gonna be flying across America in less than an hour and a half. We're gonna have subsonic air, 20,000 miles-there are so many things are changing. And you see it every day. More is going to change in the next eight to 10 years than happened in the last 30 or 40.\n\nBiden's View appearance by itself is unlikely to win or lose him voters, especially this early in the campaign. But his lackluster answers to friendly questions suggest he needs to shake off some campaign rust-and soon.

      "text": "Chrissy Teigen Is a Cyberbully. Could It Sink Her Career?\n\nListen to ICYMI:\n\nOn Monday, the Daily Beast published an interview with Courtney Stodden , the reality television star who was a tabloid mainstay after marrying 51-year-old Doug Hutchison at the age of 16. Despite the fact that Hutchison, an acting coach who also appeared in The Green Mile, was undoubtedly the creep in the relationship, Stodden faced intense backlash, scrutiny, and harassment from the likes of Anderson Cooper, Joy Behar and Chrissy Teigen. According to Stodden, Teigen \"wouldn't just publicly tweet about wanting me to take 'a dirt nap' but would privately DM me and tell me to kill myself.\" Publicly, Teigen tweeted things like, \"my Friday fantasy. you. dirt nap. mmmmmm baby.\" and \"go. to sleep. forever.\"\n\nOn Saturday's episode of ICYMI , Slate's new podcast about internet culture, co-hosts Rachelle Hampton and Madison Malone Kircher revisit Teigen's past Twitter behavior and the many controversies that she's largely managed to come away from unscathed, raising questions about the very nature of internet celebrity and who gets to attain it.\n\nKircher : To start, I need everybody to go back in time with me to 2011. Courtney Stodden-who was 16 years old at the time and a pretty average teenager-slash-YouTuber-made headlines because they got married as a teen to Doug Hutchison who is a 50-year-old acting coach, probably best known for his role as the creepy, awful prison guard in The Green Mile .\n\nStodden, who has since come out as nonbinary, told ABC that they met Doug Hutchison online and that they were able to get married because Courtney's mother knew about the whole thing.\n\nHampton : Because the internet is just a great and wonderful and supportive place, people immediately were like: \"What the fuck is wrong with this man? This wedding should immediately be dissolved.\" No, that's not what happened! They immediately made Courtney Stodden a target for bullying and slut-shaming and scrutiny from your average American gossip rag readers. And also incredibly famous American gossip rag readers, including none other than one Anderson Cooper who, on his CNN segment \"RidicuList,\" took minutes, hours out of his day, not to lambaste Doug Hutchison for being a fucking creep, but to make fun of Courtney Stodden who, again, was 16 at the time.*\n\nKircher : It's so gross. Also it wasn't just Anderson Cooper. That's the most horrifying thing, right? This was just the way people talked about Courtney Stodden's relationship in 2011.\n\nHampton : Among this group of people who were harassing a literal child for being abused and groomed was Chrissy Teigen, who sent so many terrible tweets to Courtney and allegedly also DM'd them. But the tweets that are public include things like, \"My Friday fantasy, you dirt nap, baby.\" Or \"Go to sleep forever.\" Or \"What drug makes you do that with your mouth? Asking for a friend who really wants to know how to look like an idiot. Thanks.\"\n\nKircher : These tweets have since been deleted, but it's not hard to find screenshots of them online, and they're awful. Teigen in the 2011 era was just becoming the megafamous model-slash-mogul-slash-momfluencer-mompreneur. ... There's a lot of slashes. This was all just beginning. She had been Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Rookie of the Year in 2010, she had briefly been one of the case-holding models on Deal or No Deal . She got married to John Legend in 2013. All this is to say that she hadn't quite become this megafamous Twitter person yet, but this was certainly someone who was less infamous and more famous than Courtney Stodden.\n\nHampton : A hundred percent. And again, a full-grown adult.\n\nKircher : Teigen now, of course, is a Twitter power player.\n\nHampton : As Teigen's star continues to rise, she seems to learn literally nothing in terms of how to interact with people on the internet, specifically and perhaps most worryingly, children. She came after not only Courtney Stodden, but Quvenzhané Wallis who played Hushpuppy in Beasts of the Southern Wild and also Annie in the Annie remake. In 2013, Quvenzhané, who was then 9 years old, spent so much time that year getting people to properly pronounce her name. That was apparently just too much for Chrissy to handle because during the Oscar's red carpet, Chrissy tweets, \"Is it okay to call a small child cocky?\" Before then, adding, \"I am forced to like Quvenzhané Wallis because she's a child, right? Okay, fine.\"\n\nKircher : I feel like anytime Chrissy Teigen tweets anything, if you go to her mentions, you'll find people being like, \"This you?\"-with screenshots of the sorts of tweets we're talking about.\n\nThe thing about Chrissy Teigen is she has been embroiled in some Internet experiences where she was genuinely a target. In 2018, Chrissy Teigen and John Legend and their daughter were some of the earliest victims online of the QAnon conspiracy theory. Chrissy Teigen posted a picture of her daughter dressed in a hot-dog costume and there was a pizza emoji involved. That somehow became this tinfoil hat, follow the white rabbit, definitive proof that Chrissy Teigen was implicated in some completely fictitious-let's be very clear-child sex abuse ring. Very normal stuff.\n\nKircher : As she's being attacked more and more by these alt-right, right-wing, whatever you want to call them, unsurprisingly, guess who appears tweeting about Chrissy Teigen?\n\nHampton : Oh, I can only hazard a guess that it is none other than our former tweeter in chief?\n\nKircher : Donald J. Trump. That is true. In 2019, he referred to Chrissy Teigen as, John Legend's \"filthy mouth wife.\"\n\nHampton : That is the thing: Chrissy Teigen has been the target of so many people that objectively are terrible.\n\nKircher : This of course, only worked in Chrissy Teigen's favor because she-Rachelle, clench your jaw and brace your shoulders-she clapped back. She tweeted, \"lol what a pussy ass bitch tagged everyone but me, an honor, Mr. President.\"\n\nHampton : It's a great tweet. I'm not gonna lie. This is the thing: Chrissy Teigen becomes this symbol for the resistance and this all becomes kind of part of her general brand.\n\nKircher : In March of this year, Chrissy Teigen announces out of the blue that she's leaving Twitter for good. She has had enough, saying, \"For two years, I've taken so many small, two follower count punches that at this point I am honestly deeply bruised.\" She says that she's made mistakes in front of hundreds of thousands of people and has been held accountable for them, but she hasn't been able to block out the negativity and that she is leaving Twitter.\n\nYou can hold it in both hands, right? In one hand, I am sure Chrissy Teigen has experienced violent graphic threats of all nature. On the other hand, the accountability she's talking about are for things she said and meant and kept saying, but it doesn't really seem like she's truly been held accountable for those things, right?\n\nHampton : Yeah. There's this kind of interesting turn that a lot of Teigen's fans pull, where if you call Teigen out for the things that she's done, there's this bad faith argument that you're aligning yourself with people like Candace Owens and QAnon bots.\n\nKircher : When she talks about accountability, accountability might've looked like celebrities and brands and networks choosing not to work with a woman who had publicly told a 16-year-old to take their own life or bullied a 9-year-old Black actress. Shocking no one, a few weeks later, Chrissy Teigen rejoins Twitter. She came back and said that \"It turns out it feels terrible to silence yourself\" and she's going to take the good with the bad.\n\nHampton : Say you want to shitpost like the rest of us! That's fine. But you are not brave for coming back to Twitter.\n\nKircher : I know it's a cheap joke, but honestly that is the most \"Stars-They're Just Like Us!\" moment I could describe. So why are we talking about Chrissy Teigen and Courtney Stodden again in the year 2021? This week in a Daily Beast interview, Stodden brought Teigen's alleged bullying back into the news.\n\nHampton : Stodden in this Daily Beast piece says that in addition to the heinous public tweets that Teigen sent them, Teigen also sent direct messages saying things like, \"I can't wait for you to die.\" I know we have said this at least seven times, Stodden was 16 years old, was being clearly groomed, and Stodden later talks about the fact that they were being mentally and emotionally abused.\n\nKircher : These alleged DM's that Stodden received really have weighed heavy, understandably, on them for years now, for the better part of a decade.\n\nHampton : At the same time that they are being manipulated, they are also receiving death threats from people like Teigen, who, finally, 10 years later, decides to apologize on Twitter . Teigen says that she's tried unsuccessfully to reach out to Stodden personally and wants to put an apology out in public since the comments that she made were public. Teigen writes: \"I am ashamed and completely embarrassed at my behavior, but that is nothing compared to how I made Courtney feel. I've worked so hard to give you guys joy and be beloved, and the feeling of letting you down is nearly unbearable. Truly, not my only mistakes and surely won't be my last as hard as I try, but God, I will try.\" It's not about letting her fans down. It's about the fact that you harassed and attacked a 16-year-old.\n\nWhat makes it such a bad apology is that it's barely even to Courtney themself. It's barely about Courtney because if it was about Courtney, Chrissy would have apologized a long fucking time ago. Teigen still has Courtney blocked on Twitter, and Stodden says that Teigen has not made any attempts to reach out personally. And despite that, Stodden writes this really graceful acceptance of Teigen's apologies and says: \"I accept her apology and forgive her, but the truth remains the same. I have never heard from her or her camp in private. In fact, she blocked me on Twitter. All of me wants to believe this is a sincere apology, but it feels like a public attempt to save her partnerships with Target and other brands who are realizing her 'wokeness' is a broken record.\"\n\nKircher : Now that's a statement.\n\nTo listen to the rest of the episode, subscribe to ICYMI .\n\nCorrection, May 17, 2021: This post originally misspelled RidicuList.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

In one 2008 clip, pundits were arguing that men wouldn't vote for Hillary Clinton because she reminds them of their nagging wives when she speaks.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nTrump lied in a tweet, saying the former director of national intelligence admitted there was a spy in his 2016 campaign.\n\nby Emily Stewart\n\nPresident Donald Trump in a tweet on Thursday morning lied and said that former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper admitted there was a spy in his 2016 presidential campaign. That's not true.\n\n\"Clapper has now admitted that there was Spying in my campaign,\" Trump wrote. \"Large donors were paid to the Spy, far beyond normal. Starting to look like one of the biggest political scandals in US history. SPYGATE - a terrible thing!\"\n\nIt is part of Trump's ongoing attempts to bring \" spygate \" into the lexicon and fuel a conspiracy theory that the FBI spent a spy to infiltrate his campaign. He jumped on the narrative following reporting last week from the New York Times and the Washington Post that the FBI sent an informant to talk to Trump campaign advisers after the bureau found evidence that the campaign had suspicious contacts with Russia in the early stages of the Russia investigation. The informant, an academic whom both publications declined to identify, made contact with George Papadopoulos and Carter Page and, according to the Post, Sam Clovis in 2016.\n\nTrump and his allies have falsely claimed the informant was a \"spy,\" and Trump has asked the Department of Justice to investigate whether the FBI infiltrated or surveilled his campaign.\n\nTrump's Thursday tweet appears to be a reference to an appearance by Clapper on ABC's The View on Tuesday. In an exchange with co-host Joy Behar, Clapper said explicitly that the FBI was not spying on the Trump campaign but was looking into what the Russians were trying to do. Here's the full exchange, per CNN :\n\nBEHAR: So I ask you, was the FBI spying on Trump's campaign?\n\nCLAPPER: No, they were not. They were spying on - a term I don't particularly like - but on what the Russians were doing. Trying to understand were the Russians infiltrating, trying to gain access, trying to gain leverage or influence, which is what they do.\n\nBEHAR: Well, why doesn't [Trump] like that? He should be happy.\n\nCLAPPER: He should be.\n\nThe president is becoming increasingly incensed by special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nLast weekend, he lashed out on Twitter over a Times report that Mueller was also looking into a meeting his son Donald Trump Jr. had with an emissary for Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates offering help in Trump's 2016 campaign, and he called for a Justice Department investigation of campaign surveillance. The Justice Department has, in reaction, asked its inspector general to examine if there was any impropriety in how the FBI dealt with the Trump campaign.\n\nTrump on Wednesday said in a tweet that \"SPYGATE could be one of the biggest political scandals in history!\" and said the \"Criminal Deep State\" would get caught in scandal.\n\nHe also made a slightly more hedged but also untrue statement about Clapper on Wednesday when speaking to reporters before boarding Marine One. \"If you look at Clapper, he sort of admitted that they had spies in the campaign inadvertently,\" Trump said. \"I hope it's not true, but it looks like it is.\"\n\nIt's not.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

      "text": "The Biden allegations are a reminder of the small invasions women deal with every day\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThese moments all add up to hold women back.\n\nby Anna North\n\n\"Affectionate\" is the word people keep using.\n\nFormer vice president and presumptive presidential candidate Joe Biden \"is extremely affectionate, extremely flirtatious in a completely safe way,\" Mika Brzezinski said on Monday's Morning Joe .\n\n\"It would be really unfortunate if we got rid of everybody who was just an affectionate kind of person,\" said Joy Behar on The View .\n\nBiden himself said in a statement that while he has \"offered countless handshakes, hugs, expressions of affection, support and comfort\" over the years, he never believed he was acting inappropriately. In a later statement issued on Wednesday, he pledged to \"be more mindful about respecting personal space in the future,\" while also saying, \"I've always tried to make a human connection.\"\n\nBut there's something crucial missing from the narrative that Biden is just an affectionate guy. The behaviors of which he's been accused - kissing one woman's head , rubbing noses with another woman , and a variety of other instances of touching captured on camera over the years - don't constitute sexual assault, and some say they were not sexual in intent. But such behavior can still have a pernicious effect on women, a constant, low-level distraction that can hold women back in their work and in their lives.\n\n\"It does matter and it does affect us,\" said Lucy Flores, who wrote at the Cut last week that Biden kissed her on the back of the head at a campaign event in 2014, told Vox. \"You're constantly navigating and changing your own behavior in order to avoid those kinds of situations.\"\n\nAfter the Access Hollywood tape was released in 2016, showing Donald Trump bragging about his ability to grab women \"by the pussy,\" Amanda Taub of the New York Times wrote about sexual harassment and assault as a kind of tax on women - something that costs us time, energy, and money, as we're forced to choose between defending our bodily autonomy and keeping peace with the men upon whom our careers often depend.\n\nThe idea applies here too: A kiss on the head may not seem severe, especially as the #MeToo movement has revealed countless reports of violent sexual assault. But such kisses add, little by little, to the tax that women pay for existing in American society.\n\n\"If you're spending time and energy and emotion working to avoid a harasser or a specific environment, you're not going to be putting that time toward your career,\" Amy Blackstone, a sociology professor at the University of Maine who has studied the effects of harassment, told Vox.\n\nSo when we evaluate allegations like the ones against Biden, it's not enough to ask whether the behavior involved was criminal, or whether it was meant in a sexual way. We should also be asking whether it contributed to an environment that is still, even in the #MeToo era, dragging women down.\n\nStories - and photos, and video - of Biden being \"handsy\" have been around for years, as Vox's Matt Yglesias notes . But his reputation for excessive touching started to get more attention on Friday, after Flores, a former Nevada state lawmaker wrote that, in 2014, then-Vice President Biden came up behind her, smelled her hair, and planted a kiss on the back of her head.\n\nThe incident happened, Flores writes, as she was about to take the stage at a rally, where she'd be campaigning for lieutenant governor of Nevada. Afterward, \"I wanted nothing more than to get Biden away from me,\" she wrote. \"My name was called and I was never happier to get on stage in front of an audience.\"\n\nMeanwhile, on Monday, Amy Lappos told the Hartford Courant that Biden had grabbed her by the head and rubbed noses with her in 2009. \"It wasn't sexual,\" she said. However, she told the paper, \"There's a line of respect. Crossing that line is not grandfatherly. It's not cultural. It's not affection. It's sexism or misogyny.\"\n\nMany defenses of Biden have centered on the claim that he never intended to make sexual advances toward women. \"I am sure that somebody can misconstrue something he's done,\" Brzezinski said . \"But as much as I can know what's in anyone's heart, I don't think there is bad intent on his part at all.\"\n\nBiden himself said in a statement that \"not once - never - did I believe I acted inappropriately. If it is suggested I did so, I will listen respectfully. But it was never my intention.\"\n\nAnd for some, that's enough. \"Biden's saying, I didn't intend to make anyone uncomfortable but I'll listen & learn,\" tweeted NBC News analyst Mimi Rocah . \"If respectful statements like that aren't welcomed, we're just encouraging the Trump double down & smear approach.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Biden added that \"social norms have begun to change,\" and that he would be more mindful of his actions in the future. \"But I'll always believe governing, quite frankly - life, for that matter - is about connecting with people.\"\n\nFlores told Vox she was disappointed by Biden's statement on Wednesday. \"Cultural norms are not changing,\" she said. \"This type of behavior has always been inappropriate. We have just now reached a tipping point where women are feeling like enough is enough.\"\n\nIn the statement, Biden makes the case that his physical conduct - he describes touches on the shoulder and hugs - has always been about bonding with people. But regardless of his intent, the effects of behavior matter. And the effects of Biden's conduct, according to Flores, were real.\n\n\"Even if his behavior wasn't violent or sexual, it was demeaning and disrespectful,\" Flores wrote. \"I wasn't attending the rally as his mentee or even his friend; I was there as the most qualified person for the job.\"\n\nBiden, she said, \"made me feel uneasy, gross, and confused.\"\n\nAnd then she had to take the stage and campaign. It was a moment when she no doubt had to bring all her skills to bear to make the best possible case before voters. And in that moment, she says, Biden failed to treat her as the qualified candidate she was.\n\n\"I am a professional,\" Flores told Vox. To have a man \"treat you as if you are just this frail woman who needs support, that in and of itself is degrading.\"\n\nWomen are frequently assumed to be unqualified for their jobs and forced to prove their expertise again and again - Biden, in Flores's account, was behaving in a way that played into those assumptions.\n\nImagine if, before she took the stage, Biden had shaken her hand and offered her words of encouragement - if she'd been able to approach voters feeling supported by the vice president, rather than having to shake off feelings of discomfort at a crucial moment in her political career.\n\nFlores was able to move past the incident in the moment, she told Vox: \"You move forward and you put it out of your mind, and you process it later.\" And maybe nothing about Flores's race, which she eventually lost, would have been different if Biden had behaved differently. The effect of an individual small moment like the one Flores describes is hard to measure. But the fact that women have to deal with moments like that constantly, and men rarely do, perpetuates inequality.\n\n\"The burden of avoiding and enduring sexual harassment and assault results, over time, in lost opportunities and less favorable outcomes for girls and women,\" Taub wrote at the Times in 2016. \"It is effectively a sort of gender-specific tax that many women have no choice but to pay.\"\n\nSometimes, the tax is obvious, like when a woman has to leave her job - or her entire field - to get away from a harassing boss. Research shows that sexual harassment in science and engineering contributes to women's decision to leave those fields, Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute who has studied the gender pay gap, told Vox. And overall, women who are harassed are 6.5 times more likely to leave their jobs than women who don't experience harassment, according to a 2017 study co-authored by Blackstone, the sociologist.\n\nLeaving a job due to harassment can affect women's earning prospects. In Blackstone's study, the women who were harassed were significantly more likely to report financial stress two years after their harassment than women who were not harassed.\n\nBut sometimes, the tax accrues more subtly and slowly, in little moments that pop up again and again throughout a woman's life.\n\n\"Whereas men can freely seize an opportunity, women must pause and weigh the costs,\" Taub added, asking themselves questions like, \"Is it worth accepting a professor's offer for one-on-one research mentorship on the assumption that his interest in me is strictly academic?\"\n\nAsking oneself those questions takes time and mental energy that could be spent on other tasks - tasks men get to perform uninhibited. The constant need to worry about misconduct from men can result in opportunities turned down, or simply a feeling of exhaustion and self-doubt that can keep a woman from doing her best work.\n\n\"If you're all of a sudden put on a project with someone you feel threatened by,\" Gould said, \"that's going to affect your ability to be most productive or to be present.\"\n\nWomen make about 81 percent of what men make in America today - black, Latina, and Native American women make significantly less than that. As Taub notes, women are less likely than men to make partner at a law firm, or to get tenure at a university. And although women won more seats in Congress than ever in 2018, they still make up less than a quarter of the legislature.\n\nHow much of that is due to the constant drag on women's progress caused by men's invasions of their physical space? It's hard to know. But a great way to find out would be for men to stop it.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nAn exhausting - if not exhaustive - timeline of J.K.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe Republican candidate wants to lead California. Her party, meanwhile, is decimating trans rights.\n\nby Katelyn Burns\n\nIt was late June 2015 when I asked my mom a question that carried much more weight than she perhaps realized at the time. Bearing the dual burdens of gender dysphoria and the closet, I asked her what she thought of Caitlyn Jenner's Vanity Fair cover , which had been revealed just days earlier.\n\nI had been struggling with whether I should transition, which would undoubtedly blow up my relatively comfortable life. I had no idea how my family would react to my coming out - growing up, LGBTQ issues weren't discussed at the dinner table. I was pretty sure my mom would be supportive, but I wasn't certain. Countless trans people had been unexpectedly let down by their parents before me.\n\nI held my breath as I waited for her response.\n\n\"Good for her if it makes her happy,\" my mom replied. It was a short but promising signal that maybe, possibly, I could safely come out to her at some point. Caitlyn Jenner's coming out became a catalyst for gauging my family's feelings about trans people.\n\nVox's German Lopez is here to guide you through the Biden administration's burst of policymaking. Sign up to receive our newsletter each Friday .\n\nI was not alone. Julie Kleinbach, a 53-year-old trans woman from just outside Sacramento, California, said Jenner's coming out served as initial inspiration for her too. After years of thinking about transitioning, Kleinbach said she felt, at least in a small way, the courage to come out after seeing Jenner \"almost be accepted.\"\n\nJenner's transition helped bring trans people visibility in the waning days of the Obama administration, which made American trans lives easier to live in substantial ways, by passing laws prohibiting discrimination in health care, reforming passport gender markers, and enacting gender identity protections throughout the federal government. And she was clear at the outset that she wanted to be a leader for trans equality. \"I've lived a fascinating life,\" Jenner told USA Today Sports in 2017 . \"Especially now, being in the fourth quarter, I'm happy to be where I'm at. I sincerely want to make a difference, to help my (trans) community.\"\n\nThough her coming out was momentous, Jenner did not arrive with trans-savvy talking points. Early into her transition, Jenner said she didn't mind when people called her by her deadname, which most trans people generally consider a painful faux pas. She also complained about not being able to hang out with her male friends at the country club like she used to. Her problems - and public statements - were a natural outgrowth from her wealthy, privileged background and relative newness to trans issues.\n\n\"It's been really disappointing to see the extent to which she has not understood why [it] was so easy for her\" to access transition-related care and receive relative acceptance, said Kleinbach, a registered voter in California. \"All the people that came before her that paved the way didn't have that luxury, didn't have her privilege.\"\n\nEven more insulting for the trans community was her continued defense of the Republican Party - and of Donald Trump in particular - as the GOP kicked off a moral panic over trans issues that rages ever harder even now.\n\nIn 2017, she told Seth Meyers she's \"not a one-issue voter,\" saying she acknowledges Democrats are better on queer equality but that she also believes in the \"Constitution, freedom, [and] minimum government.\" Meanwhile, Politico reported April 21 that Jenner hasn't been much of an active voter at all, sitting out almost two-thirds of the elections in which she was eligible to vote since 2000.\n\nJenner did speak out publicly on rare occasions, criticizing Trump over his ban on trans military service and attacks on trans health care access. In an August 2018 interview with Variety , she claimed she was working on fighting back against transphobic conservative policies quietly, through back channels.\n\n\"I don't do a lot of media. I don't want to be seen everywhere,\" she told Variety. \"Today, I'm very politically involved. Nobody really knows it. I do it very quietly because I have been so criticized by the liberal side of the media. I can get more things done if I don't stick my nose into everything publicly.\"\n\nNow Jenner isn't keeping her politics out of the public eye. She has thrown her hat in the ring for the California recall race in a bid to replace Gavin Newsom as the state's chief executive. She filed paperwork as a Republican candidate on April 23 and has teamed up with former Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale .\n\nWhile California is one of the most supportive states for LGBTQ people, it is also majority Democrat, so it's not clear to whom, exactly, Jenner's run is supposed to appeal. Her trans identity may hold her back from attracting votes from hard-core Trump supporters in the state, too. \"If her base is trans sympathetic Republicans, well, that's not 51 percent,\" Jim Newton, a former LA Times reporter who's now an editor at Blueprint, a UCLA-sponsored public policy magazine in California, told Vox. \"But in this race, if there are enough candidates, and they divide up the vote enough ways, she could win with a lot less than that.\"\n\nJenner's politics and controversial existence as a self-professed trans advocate has long put trans Americans in a double bind, forcing them to defend her from transphobic attacks while deploring her political views. And her gubernatorial run, however successful, is amplifying those tensions once again.\n\nIn 2016, the hot political culture war was over bathrooms - specifically trans people in bathrooms. North Carolina had just passed HB2, a.k.a. the bathroom bill , triggering an uproar of protests and causing billions of dollars in revenue to leave the state after widespread boycotts.\n\nIn the middle of it all, and in the midst of a heated presidential campaign, Jenner posted a short video to social media showing her emerging from a women's bathroom in Trump Tower.\n\nThe inference she was trying to illustrate was clear: Donald Trump supports trans people because she could use the women's room in his building. Left unsaid is that Trump was (and still is) required by New York City law to let trans people use the bathrooms on his property according to their gender identity. It's the kind of law that, incidentally, Trump and Jenner's fellow Republicans generally oppose.\n\nJenner's political naivety became apparent on her 2015-2016 reality show I Am Cait , which followed her and a group of trans activists, intellectuals, and celebrities as they traveled the country meeting with groups of trans people. A frustrating political discussion broke out between Jenner and the other trans women on the show, with Jenner insisting Republicans didn't care about attacking trans people even as conservative states moved on bathroom legislation.\n\n\"These girls think that now that I've transitioned that everything has to change,\" she said in an on-camera interview. \"[They say], 'You can't be conservative anymore. You have to be a liberal.' No, I don't believe that. I think I can keep all of my views the same 'cause I feel in my heart that's the best way to go.\"\n\nDespite forewarning from around the trans community, Jenner continued to claim Trump - and the Republican Party - supported trans people. Trump became perhaps the most actively anti-trans president in the history of the US, rolling back nondiscrimination protections in health care, banning trans people from the military, trying to exclude trans people from equal education rights, giving homeless shelters and prisons the right to force trans people to be housed according to their assigned sex at birth ... the list goes on and on.\n\nIn October 2018, Jenner admitted she was wrong about Trump being good for LGBTQ people. \"The reality is that the trans community is being relentlessly attacked by this president,\" she wrote in an October 2018 op-ed for the Washington Post . But her early support for the now-former president left a lasting impression on trans Californians. Eleanor Hall, a 24-year-old trans woman from Berkeley, told Vox that Jenner \"trying to advocate that Donald Trump was in some way going to be good for trans people\" is why she couldn't trust her as governor.\n\nJenner also remains a proud Republican even as her conservative colleagues escalate their attacks on the trans community. Republican-led state legislatures are executing a coordinated effort to ban trans adolescents from accessing lifesaving transition care and trans girls from girls sports ; so far this legislative session, eight states have passed anti-trans bills and more than 250 anti-LGBTQ bills have been introduced, according to the Human Rights Campaign .\n\nIt's not clear who, if anybody, Jenner's campaign appeals to. It seems unlikely she'll appeal to the state's hardest-core conservatives who have been railing against trans people for years. Meanwhile, California liberals, both trans and cis, will have a hard time getting behind her. It's not clear at this point what her platform will be beyond her association with Parscale; so far, her official campaign website has only three functions: soliciting donations, selling campaign merchandise, and signing people up for campaign updates. She told Variety in 2018 that her political views had evolved over the first few years of her transition, saying she identifies as \"economically conservative, socially progressive.\"\n\nBut that doesn't really jibe with the overwhelmingly progressive California trans community.\n\n\"My impression of her in general is I sort of assume the worst an older, white, Republican woman is going to do,\" Zach Hauptman, a 37-year-old nonbinary person in San Francisco, told Vox. \"And that way I'm never disappointed.\"\n\nDespite how trans people may feel about Jenner's views, it doesn't mean they don't condemn the transphobia she's faced.\n\nBefore she transitioned, it was reported Jenner had a tracheal shave , a procedure trans women sometimes get to reduce or remove the appearance of an Adam's apple, which puzzled cis people and triggered mockery at the time. In 2015, Jenner was named one of Glamour's women of the year, which turned into a conservative meme that is still openly mocked in online circles for social conservatives and trans-exclusionary radical feminists, or TERFs . Conservative media still misgenders or sometimes calls her by her deadname.\n\nThe trans Californians who spoke with Vox worry Jenner's campaign may stir the transphobia pot ever further. Kleinbach said she's had to defend Jenner from transphobia before, \"mainly with respect to pronouns and people calling her [by her deadname] instead of Caitlyn,\" she said. \"My actions in speaking up for someone that's being harassed are separate from my feelings about that person's actions.\"\n\nBut for Kleinbach, the bigger frustration has been with Jenner's actions than with those who attack her. \"She's had such a soapbox. She's had such an opportunity to reach people,\" Kleinbach said. \"It's more irritating, in a way, that she has chosen not to not use her platform to educate people and to help people understand.\"\n\nJenner's campaign, representing a party that is now forcing families with trans kids to potentially flee conservative states, puts trans people in an awkward spot - feeling like they must defend her identity while Jenner does nothing but promote herself in return.\n\nHer run could also serve to kick up transphobia on the left. Liberals and Democrats have shown no hesitation to attack a conservative political figure's perceived identity. One homophobic example are online liberals calling Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) \"Lady G,\" a reference to an obscure and unverified online accusation that he frequently visits with gay sex workers in DC. Just last week, The View cohost Joy Behar misgendered Jenner as she talked about Jenner's gubernatorial run (she subsequently apologized).\n\nThere's a risk that Jenner, running as a conservative in liberal California, could generate liberal transphobia in a similar way, causing progressives to conflate their annoyance with Jenner's Hollywood persona and politics with her trans identity. \"If you throw insults or slurs at celebrities because you're upset with them, what are you saying to the people next to you?\" asked Hauptman.\n\nRight now, it seems unlikely Jenner has a shot at becoming governor. A vote to recall Newsom will be on the November ballot, and more than half of voters will have to answer \"yes\" for the recall to succeed. If it is successful, the top vote-getter named in the second question on the ballot will win the election - which means that \"if there are 25 candidates in the recall, the winner could win with 15 percent\" of the vote, said Newton. This could be in Jenner's favor, since she has name recognition, but a mid-March poll by the Public Policy Institute of California found that only 40 percent of residents supported the recall.\n\n\"If California continues to battle Covid successfully in the fall, then I think it's very hard for me to imagine that [Newsom] gets recalled,\" said Newton. \"Then it doesn't matter where Jenner gets her support.\"\n\nBut that doesn't mean the race itself won't create a lasting impact. For now, trans Californians are holding their breath and watching their neighbors' reactions to Jenner's campaign.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nEnglish-language networks dismissed and belittled a cultural milestone.\n\nby Alexia Fernández Campbell\n\nSince the Democratic debate ended Wednesday evening, the jokes have not stopped coming about the candidates who spoke Spanish onstage.\n\nAfter former Rep. Beto O'Rourke and Sen. Cory Booker uttered several somewhat-broken Spanish sentences at the debate, Trevor Noah teased that it's like \"when Dad says, 'Hola, como estas?' to the waiter at the Mexican restaurant.\" Cable news shows treated it as a curiosity. Hosts of The View rolled their eyes. \"To me, it was a little bit pandering, off the top,\" Joy Behar said Thursday morning on the show. Meghan McCain nodded in agreement.\n\nThe reaction was completely different on the Spanish-language news shows, however. Panelists called it a \"historic\" moment, saying that the Spanish language was one of the \"champions\" of the night.\n\nIn fact, it was the first topic discussed during Telemundo's post-debate analysis. \"We have never heard our language this much in a presidential debate,\" said Telemundo anchor Felicidad Aveleyra, approvingly.\n\nHer co-anchor, Julio Vaqueiro, agreed. \"[Spanish] was the main protagonist.\"\n\nNot all panelists were on the same page, but the anchors represented the overall mood on Univision and on CNN en Español, too. And, in a sense, their opinion is the one that matters most to Democrats trying to win the Latinx vote. More than 5 million US viewers tune in each week for the primetime evening news shows on Telemundo and Univision - the two leading Spanish-language networks in the US.\n\nMost commentators agreed that former HUD Secretary Julián Castro - who announced his run for the presidency in Spanish onstage - was the star of the night, and his stance on immigration was well-received. Talking about his proposal to repeal a section of US law that makes it a federal crime for immigrants to cross the border illegally, he said it's time to \"go back to the way we used to treat this when somebody comes across the border, not to criminalize desperation, to treat that as a civil violation.\"\n\nBut it was a triumphant moment for Spanish-language media overall that three candidates spoke Spanish several times. It was also a hit with Miami viewers, noted Univision correspondent Lourdes Del Río, who attended a debate-watch party.\n\n\"Everyone liked that there were moments when people talked in Spanish, because they were speaking directly to the Latinx community, which is really important for anyone who aspires to make it to the White House,\" Del Río said on the air after the debate.\n\nInside the Adrienne Arsht Center, immediately following the debate, a Telemundo correspondent asked Latino Victory Vice President, Mayra Macias, how the audience reacted when they heard candidates speaking en español.\n\n\"At first we were confused because we are not used to hearing Spanish on the national stage for a presidential debate,\" she answered on the air. \"It was an honor to be in the room and hear Spanish and realize that the candidates know that they need the Latino vote and need to do everything to win our vote.\n\nThe storied former Univision anchor Maria Elena Salinas also tweeted that it was a symbolic moment for Latinx Americans.\n\n\"The effort to speak Spanish, while not enough to win the Latino vote, is a sign of respect to our culture. Obviously the voters all speak English, they're [American] citizens,\" she wrote in Spanish on Thursday.\n\nThat gesture of respect is all the more meaningful at a time when Latinx Americans and immigrants are repeatedly denigrated by President Donald Trump's administration.\n\nSpanish-speaking on the debate stage began in the first hour with O'Rourke, a border native who feels comfortable speaking the language. When he was asked by moderator Savannah Guthrie if he would support a 70 percent top tax rate on the highest earners, he didn't seem to want to answer that. Instead, he started speaking in Spanish.\n\n\"We need to include every person in the success of this economy,\" he said in Spanish, mixing up a few masculine and feminine words. \"But if we want to do this, we need to include everyone in our democracy. We need the representation of every voter, and we need to hear every voice.\"\n\nHis fluent Spanish, with a thick gringo accent, seemed to surprise Booker, who appeared not to want to be outdone. When asked about what he would do about the border crisis, Booker paused, then stumbled through a nearly incomprehensible answer in Spanish.\n\n\"The situation right now is unacceptable. The president has attacked and demonized immigrants. It's unacceptable. I will change this,\" he said in Spanish, speaking slowly in what seemed to be a rehearsed response.\n\nThe exchange led to many jokes and memes online:\n\nJulián Castro, the only Latino candidate in the race, didn't seem as desperate to show off his Spanish during the debate. But at the end, he declared, with the best Spanish pronunciation of them all, \"I am Julián Castro and I am running for president of the United States.\"\n\nWhile some found it jarring to hear Democrats speaking Spanish casually on the national stage - knowing millions of viewers would not understand - it also made sense. The candidates were speaking to a Miami audience - a key voting bloc for Democrats. About 69 percent of Miami residents are Latinx, and most of them feel more comfortable speaking Spanish than English. Democrats really, really need Florida Latinos to vote for them and flip Florida back to blue.\n\nAs Latinx Americans noted online, the candidates' effort to speak Spanish was significant: 41 million people in the US speak Spanish, and it's rare to be addressed on a national stage and shown that respect.\n\nModerator José Diaz-Balart, a well known Spanish-language news anchor on Telemundo, even asked O'Rourke an entire question in Spanish.\n\n\"Congressman O'Rourke, what would you do on the first day as president, about the reality of what's happening at the border?\" he asked.\n\n\"We are going to treat each person with the respect and dignity that they deserve as humans,\" he said in Spanish.\n\nIt was the kind of answer that Spanish-speaking viewers were waiting to hear.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nIn an ironic twist, President Trump is now against conspiracy theories.\n\nby Aaron Rupar\n\nOn Wednesday morning, President Trump - a man who rose to political prominence during the Obama years by pushing a conspiracy theory that America's first black president was a secret Muslim from Africa - denounced a conspiracy theory about his own wife.\n\n\"The Fake News photoshopped pictures of Melania, then propelled conspiracy theories that it's actually not her by my side in Alabama and other places,\" Trump tweeted. \"They are only getting more deranged with time!\"\n\nThe conspiracy theory Trump alluded too - we'll call it \"fake Melania\" - holds that during some public appearances, a body double has filled in for Melania Trump. Despite what Trump tweeted, it is not based on photoshopped images, but instead on real images of Melania compared to older ones.\n\n\"Fake Melania\" first spread on social media in the fall of 2017 , when a Twitter user posted side-by-side photos and video clips to make a case that the woman who appeared by Trump's side during a public event was not in fact Melania. It has been fueled by the White House's lack of transparency about what the first lady is up to, such as when she disappeared from the public eye for nearly three weeks last year amid questions about her health and her relationship with her husband.\n\nThe conspiracy theory has gained steam again following Trump's trip to Alabama last Friday - one in which a number of social media users speculated that the woman who traveled with the president was not in fact his wife.\n\nTo be clear, there's no more basis to this conspiracy theory than there was to the one that Barack Obama's birth certificate was fake. But on Monday, The View covered it during a tongue-in-cheek segment.\n\n\"I'm not convinced - how much effort is that gonna take for someone to figure out exactly how to be here,\" co-host Abby Huntsman said (Huntsman is the daughter of Jon Huntsman, Trump's ambassador to Russia). \"If it's not her, why not just stay home?\"\n\nLater Monday, Melania's spokesperson, Stephanie Grisham, tweeted criticism of The View 's coverage.\n\nTwo days later, Fox & Friends also weighed in with a segment that apparently brought the conspiracy theory to Trump's attention - prompting one of many tweets he posted about his favorite TV show during Wednesday's installment of \"executive time.\"\n\nTrump first tweeted about \"fake Melania\" around an hour after Fox & Friends did a segment on the topic that was centered on criticizing The View .\n\nTrump's tweet embodies the Fox News-to-White House pipeline, coming as it did during a morning the president seemed to while away by live-tweeting a Fox & Friends episode he watched on delay.\n\nIn addition to the \"fake Melania\" tweet, Trump also tweeted about segments the show did on Jay Leno criticizing liberal comedians , Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom's move to put a moratorium on the death penalty in the state, the release of a transcript of ex-FBI agent Lisa Page's congressional testimony , and comments former Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz made on the show criticizing former FBI Director James Comey.\n\nIndeed, live-tweeting Fox & Friends has become something of a pastime for the president.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump posted his first Fox & Friends -inspired tweet at 7:15 am and his last at 10:14 am. Trump had nothing on his public schedule for Wednesday until 11:30 am, when he was scheduled to receive an \"intelligence briefing.\"\n\nBeyond the hypocrisy of a man who has embraced countless conspiracy theories over the years now denouncing conspiracy theories, Trump's tweet about \"fake Melania\" represented an unfair attack on the media.\n\nDespite what Trump would have you believe, no major media outlets have used photoshopped images of Melania to push conspiracy theories about her. In fact, beyond The View , the theory hasn't gotten much coverage at all, other than a few outlets aggregating social media posts about it from mostly random users.\n\nIt's unclear where Trump got the idea that \"fake Melania\" is based on photoshopped images. That idea didn't come up during Fox & Friends ' discussion, or on The View . Perhaps Trump saw the images of Melania displayed during Fox & Friends' discussion and thought they must've been photoshopped.\n\nRegardless, Trump, thirsty as always to attack the press, spun a conspiracy theory that originated from the dark corners of Twitter and used it to attack the \"Fake News\" with a conspiracy theory about a conspiracy theory.\n\nWhile two wrongs don't make a right, it's worth noting that Melania herself has indulged in conspiracy theories.\n\nDuring an April 2011 appearance on The Joy Behar Show - ironically, Behar is now a co-host of The View - Melania echoed her husband by questioning whether Obama's birth certificate is legit.\n\n\"It's not only Donald who wants to see [Obama's birth certificate], it's American people who voted for him and who didn't vote for him. They want to see that,\" she said, prompting Behar to point out that Obama had in fact produced his birth certificate. But Melania indicated that wasn't enough for her.\n\n\"We feel it's different than birth certificate,\" Melania responded.\n\nEight years and an unlikely presidential run later, the Trumps are now on the business end of conspiracy theories.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nTwo top elected Democratic officials in Virginia wore blackface in the 1980s. But does a racist action require racist intent?\n\nby Jane Coaston\n\nVirginia Democrats in state government are reeling from a series of almost incomprehensible scandals , one involving a serious allegation of sexual assault and two involving blackface and racism, all of which could shift the balance of political power in the state. And many on the right are, to put it mildly, somewhat amused by the chaos.\n\nBut conservatives are also raising their own concerns about Virginia's current political maelstrom, specifically regarding demands from Democrats and others for Gov. Ralph Northam and Attorney General Mark Herring to resign over their use of blackface during the 1980s. And those concerns have taken on two forms.\n\nFirst, some on the right are wondering whether America is \"prepared to rebuke everyone from Judy Garland to Joni Mitchell to Jimmy Kimmel\" over the issue of blackface, arguing that a \"zero tolerance\" policy for blackface does more harm than good. As Coleman Hughes argued in National Review on Wednesday, \"Instead, we should take a more measured approach, one that, without minimizing the ugly legacy of minstrelsy, allows a modicum of mercy for the accused and accounts for the intentions of the transgressor.\" (Hughes is African-American.)\n\nBut second, and perhaps far more important, other conservatives are wondering whether blackface - typically, the act of white people dressing up as black people by using makeup, or, in Northam's case, shoe polish - is always racist, or whether it can be the product of ignorance, without being inherently racist or reveling in stereotypes. In short, does an action require racist intent to be racist?\n\nAs my colleague Dylan Scott detailed on Wednesday, the allegations surrounding both Northam and Herring are focused on their use of blackface while in medical school and college, respectively, with a photograph from Northam's medical school yearbook page showing someone in blackface and someone in a Ku Klux Klan hood emerging after he made comments about an abortion bill that some construed as supportive of infanticide.\n\nAs for Herring:\n\nHerring, the attorney general, follows Northam and Fairfax in the Virginia line of succession. But on Wednesday, he admitted that he, too, had put on blackface for a college party in 1980, when he and his friends \"dressed like rappers.\" Herring called it a one-time occurrence and said he had \"a callous and inexcusable lack of awareness and insensitivity to the pain my behavior could inflict on others.\"\n\n\"It was really a minimization of both people of color and a minimization of a horrific history I knew well even then,\" Herring said in a statement.\n\nWith this in mind, Hughes's piece in National Review points out something important. As New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie notes , \"blackface is so thoroughly associated with the worst of American racism that we should expect immediate condemnation of politicians and public figures who have any association with it, even if it's a decades-old offense.\" But the practice appears to remain bafflingly common.\n\nJimmy Kimmel did it. Jimmy Fallon did it . Sarah Silverman did it. Ashton Kutcher did it. The View co-host Joy Behar did it . Heck, Shirley Temple did it (she was 7 years old at the time).\n\nIn the early 1980s, when both Northam and Herring were apparently using blackface, GOP House Minority Leader Robert Michel defended blackface and minstrel shows as \"fun\" and not \"disparaging.\"\n\nOn college campuses across the country, the use of blackface at parties was and is apparently so common that barely two weeks ago, a Tufts University student was investigated by school officials for allegedly appearing on Instagram in blackface. (And it's not just college: Around that same time, Florida's secretary of state resigned from office after photographs of him in blackface mocking survivors of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 became public. He was 35 years old at the time.)\n\n(I should note here that when I spoke about the Virginia case with National Review columnist David French, who was born in Alabama and grew up in Louisiana, Tennessee, and Kentucky, he told me that he had never seen a blackface incident \"aside from on the news.\")\n\nBut with so many people apparently engaging in black-people cosplay, some on the right argue that to repudiate all of them would be not only impossible but wrong. The American Conservative's Rod Dreher wrote that the scandal was just \"identity politics\" run amok, adding, \"I'm on record here saying that blackface, even in the 1980s, is inexcusable - but I don't believe that Ralph Northam should resign over it, provided that he has no record of mistreating black people as a physician and a politician.\"\n\nRedState's Elizabeth Vaughn argued that Northam and Herring were in college when they wore blackface, and that some black comedians have worn whiteface. She concluded, \"Do we really want to live in such an intolerant society, knowing that something as trivial as a Halloween costume we may have worn 40 years ago might destroy us?\"\n\n(The \"whiteface\" incident referenced here is from an Eddie Murphy sketch skewering racism that appeared on Saturday Night Live in the 1980s. Part of the sketch finds Murphy, wearing whiteface, visiting a bank for a loan and being handed fistfuls of money and told, \"Pay us back anytime you like. Or don't!\" It is not, to be clear, the same thing as blackface, because context and history have not yet died.)\n\nAnd others on the right wonder if there are gradations within the topic of blackface itself - whether dressing up as a specific black person (in the case of Herring, 1980s hip-hop legend Kurtis Blow) is substantively different from the type of blackface popularized in minstrel shows in the early 19th century and still occasionally seen today .\n\nI spoke with conservative pundit Ben Shapiro about his thoughts on Northam and Herring. He told me, \"Blackface is racist; putting on makeup to dress up as Diana Ross is racially insensitive at best and racist at worst, but isn't equivalent to Al Jolson singing 'Mammy,' which is unmistakable and obviously malicious racism.\"\n\n\"Attributing the same level of racism to both actions seems inaccurate,\" he said. \"Ignorance and stupidity seem plausible in the first case but not the second. This distinction is only important in how we treat possible forgiveness. Sins of intent are worse than sins of ignorance.\"\n\nFrench told me that \"I don't really credit the notion that there might exist 'innocent' blackface - it was all bad, but to varying degrees.\" He added, \"I do believe that intent matters, and that not all incidents are the same.\"\n\n\"I also think there are people who used blackface and were just stupid and ignorant. I think some were casually contemptuous. I think some were deeply malicious,\" he said.\n\nThe question of intent is an important one in many aspects of public life - but not, I'd argue, on the subject of blackface, or racism in general, contrary to conservative writers like Dreher .\n\nFirst and foremost, many of the most racist actions and decisions of our past were made by people who fully believed themselves to be beyond accusations of racism. (Some of those people have even found accusations of racism themselves deeply offensive .)\n\nFor example, \"grandfather clauses\" in voting laws - which stated that only those who could vote before 1867 or if they were the descendants of those who could - technically applied to everyone living in the seven states that passed such legislation but effectively shoved black Americans (who were unable to vote before the passage of the 15th Amendment) out of the voting booth.\n\nEven in the majority decision of the 1896 Supreme Court decision Plessy v. Ferguson - which established \"separate but equal\" and effectively legalized Jim Crow laws that segregated much of America based on race - the justices argued that their decision was only considered racist because black people thought it was.\n\nAs Justice Henry Billings Brown wrote in the majority decision, \"We consider the underlying fallacy of the plaintiff's argument to consist in the assumption that the enforced separation of the two races stamps the colored race with a badge of inferiority. If this be so, it is not by reason of anything found in the act, but solely because the colored race chooses to put that construction upon it.\"\n\nBut more important, blackface was never innocent. At every point of its usage - even when African Americans were required to do it to appear onstage in the 1860s, even in 1984, when Ralph Northam was reportedly doing it - the usage of blackface was deeply and inherently racist. It played on stereotypes both old and new of black people, and, more perniciously, showed a reticence to engage with actual, real-life black people, and a preference to engage with white people dressed as black people instead.\n\nAt the height of segregation, this was explicit. For example, many Southern theaters simply would not show films in which black actors or performers appeared. Blackface, however, was permitted. When Fred Astaire performed a tap tribute to legendary black dancers Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson and John Bubbles in the 1936 film Swing Time , he did so in blackface, which is how they would have been seen by audiences at the time.\n\nEven today, blackface (even in imitation of a specific person) is indicative of a view of black people not as people but as ideas, or costumes, or something other than, and inferior to, fully realized persons. Wearing shoe polish on one's face, or using bronzer or dark makeup, does not make one look anything like, in Herring's case, Kurtis Blow, or, in Northam's case, Michael Jackson. It makes one look like, quite literally, a pale - and poor - imitation. In other words, an insult.\n\nContrary to common arguments now, blackface was considered deeply offensive by black Americans even in minstrelsy's heyday - though their voices went largely unheard. Frederick Douglass called blackface minstrel groups the \" filthy scum of white society \" in 1848, and the NAACP went to court in 1951 to prevent the televising of the blackface minstrel radio show Amos 'n' Andy . (The televised version actually starred black actors.)\n\nFor entirely understandable reasons - namely, legalized segregation and the horrific violence and depredations that came with every single piece of Jim Crow law and American anti-black racism - the NAACP and other groups striving for equality largely set their focus on attempting to keep black Americans alive and left blackface for another time.\n\nMoreover, there is such a thing as racist idiocy. Not all racism looks like the lynching of Henry Smith in 1893 in front of 10,000 jeering onlookers. Nor does all racism look like calling someone the n-word and denying them access to an apartment or medical care. Occasionally, racism looks like covering yourself in dark paint to purportedly make yourself look like Diana Ross (and failing miserably). Or believing that, like Joy Behar, putting on brown face paint can make you look like a \"beautiful African woman.\"\n\nRacism is itself deeply idiotic, based on a set of stereotypes and pseudoscientific beliefs that are more societal invention than hard-nosed fact. Yet racism's inherent absurdity has not prevented racism from resulting in hundreds of years of injustice at absolute best and human bondage and murder at worst .\n\nBlackface, too, is idiotic, and it is also tremendously racist, every single time it's done, by Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives, celebrities and comedians. Such a judgment does not require an examination of the inner workings of the human heart of the person wearing blackface. Such a judgment requires merely the willingness to look.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

      "text": "Joy Behar changes her mind on impeaching Trump after Mueller hearing\n\nThe left-leaning co-host on \"The View\" changed her mind about impeachment.\n\nLeft-leaning co-host of \"The View,\" Joy Behar , changed course on the urgency of impeaching President Donald Trump after previously disagreeing with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has rebuffed calls for his impeachment .\n\nFollowing former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's testimony on Wednesday, Behar spoke about why she thinks it's \"too distracting\" to impeach Trump leading up to the 2020 election - a view she shared with conservative co-host Meghan McCain , who emphasized the importance of winning over swing states.\n\n\"Don't underestimate the power of swing states,\" McCain said, referring to the Democratic debates coming up next week. \"Hillary Clinton won by three million voters, but lost in the electoral college.\"\n\n\"The electoral college is how you win and die in this election cycle. You don't care about these people? People in Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania - they're up for grabs,\" McCain added.\n\n\"I thought after the Mueller thing, 'You know what? Put your money in those states that you are talking about,'\" Behar said. \"Put your efforts in there.\"\n\nBehar compared the president's impeachment leading up to the 2020 election to divorcing her first husband, Joe Behar. \"When I got divorced, my husband had no money to give me, but he had a little bit, and one of my friends said, go after him for the money.\"\n\n\"I can only do one of two things. I can pursue my career or I can go after him, and I feel that way about this election,\" Behar continued. \"You can't do that many things at one time, and I was right. I have this job now because of that. I didn't spend my time going after - getting blood from a rock.\"\n\nOn Thursday, a day after Mueller's testimony, Behar pressed Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. on Congress' plans to prevent foreign governments from interfering in future elections.\n\n\"This is, you know, one of the other hopes of having Bob Mueller come in, which is to make the case why we need to protect our election's infrastructure, why we need to re-double our efforts that the Russians have never stopped meddling and they will continue to meddle.\" Schiff said. \"The reason that will be the most powerful moment in the meeting is he acknowledged this is the new normal, that American candidates are going to think it's OK to receive foreign assistance.\"\n\nSchiff also told \"The View\" co-hosts that \"the evidence is in plain sight\" on the issue of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nEvery episode of ABC's award-winning talk show \"The View\" is now available as a podcast!
