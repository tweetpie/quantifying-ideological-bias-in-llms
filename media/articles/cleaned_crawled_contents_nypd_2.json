      "text": "'People don't care': Popular internet sleuths deny NYPD's request to track down CEO shooter\n\nThe New York Police Department (NYPD) is crowd-sourcing their investigation into the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson to the general public after two days with no positive ID on the shooter. But they may not get much help from the internet, according to multiple popular TikTok sleuths.\n\nNBC News reported that law enforcement is banking on the American public helping them identify the man seen in new photos released this week, which show the alleged assassin lowering his mask while flirting with a hostel concierge . Those are currently the only photos of the alleged killer in which his mask isn't concealing his face, and law enforcement veterans have called them a \"turning point\" in the investigation.\n\nBut Savannah Sparks - who has 1.3 million TikTok followers and is known for helping track down perpetrators of racist and hateful attacks - was unequivocal in her refusal to help find Thompson's murderer. Thompson told NBC she was \"pretty apathetic\" about the ongoing manhunt, and that her impression of the online sleuthing community's current mood was: \"[C]oncepts of thoughts and prayers.\"\n\n\"It's, you know, claim denied on my prayers there,\" Sparks said, with a tongue-in-cheek reference to health insurance industry lingo.\n\nAccording to NBC, Sparks (who holds a doctorate of pharmacy and works in the healthcare industry as a lactation consultant) has been called on by law enforcement in the past to assist with training officers on how to track down suspects online. But she said that in this particular case, she has zero interest in helping the NYPD.\n\n\"Absolutely the f- not,\" she said.\n\nMichael McWhorter, who is \"TizzyEnt\" on TikTok and has more than 6.7 million followers, observed that he hadn't seen the same drumbeat from the public to find Thompson's killer that he's seen in past cases involving \"blatant violence.\" He opined that investigators may be underestimating \"how much people don't care.\" And Swarthmore College assistant professor of computer science Sukrit Venkatagiri said it's possible that some internet sleuths \"don't really empathize with who the victim is in this scenario.\"\n\n\"People are less motivated, from an altruistic perspective, to help this victim in this specific case,\" he said, noting that the victim in question was the multimillion-dollar CEO of a Fortune 500 health insurance company.\n\nOne person who helped police was software engineer Riley Walz, who obtained data from the Citibike station used by the alleged shooter after the murder. Some social media users called him a \"snitch,\" according to NBC. McWhorter said those who help police being ganged up on could discourage others from helping to identify the shooter. But he said it's possible that apathy could play a larger role.\n\n\"There's this weird thing, this vibe of like, I don't see a bunch of people just feeling an urgency,\" he said."

      "text": "NYPD to officially revoke Trump's concealed carry license after his 34 felony convictions\n\nFormer President Donald Trump can no longer legally own firearms after he was convicted of 34 felonies last week . The New York Police Department (NYPD) is now preparing to enforce the law by formally revoking the former president's gun license.\n\nAccording to CNN , Trump's firearm license was already suspended after he was indicted on felony counts, and two pistols he owned were turned over to the NYPD in March of last year. Now, as an official convicted felon, the 45th president of the United States is banned from owning guns entirely in accordance with federal law.\n\nA senior NYPD official told the outlet that an investigation is currently ongoing that \"will likely lead to revocation of [Trump's] license\" to carry firearms. A third weapon that Trump legally transferred to Florida after he officially changed residences from Trump Tower to Mar-a-Lago is also expected to be surrendered to authorities, if it hasn't already (CNN has not confirmed whether Trump turned over the third firearm to Florida law enforcement).\n\nTrump was a gun owner well before he ran for president in 2015. However, his license was exempted from public records as he submitted his firearm license application with a request for confidentiality. He reportedly maintained his license throughout his presidency, even though he's had a permanent Secret Service detail since he became the presumptive Republican presidential nominee ahead of the 2016 election.\n\nIn a 2012 interview, Trump told the Washington Times that he owned a .45-caliber H&K handgun and a .38-caliber Smith & Wesson pistol. He also suggested that the deadly Aurora, Colorado movie theater shooting that year could have been prevented if moviegoers were armed (the shooter was wearing body armor , carried an AR-15 rifle and picked up 160 pounds of ammunition from a FedEx store before the shooting).\n\n\"If some of the people in the movie theater had a gun, they'd have been shooting at him,\" Trump said at the time. \"Nobody had a gun so they were totally defenseless.\"\n\nTrump also told a conservative French newspaper in 2016 that he \"always\" carries a gun on his person , and made similar comments following a terrorist attack at the Bataclan music hall.\n\n\"I always carry a weapon on me. If I'd been at the Bataclan or one of those bars, I would have opened fire,\" Trump told Valeurs Actuelles . \"Perhaps I would have died, but at least I would have taken a shot. The worst thing is the powerlessness to respond to those who want to kill you.\"\n\nThe former president losing his gun rights is a major development for Trump, given his strong support from the gun lobby. If elected to a second term, Trump has promised to roll back numerous gun reform policies enacted during President Joe Biden's administration. This includes the Safer Communities Act , which was the gun legislation Congress passed in response to the massacre of more than a dozen young children and teachers at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas in 2022.\n\nTrump is expected to officially file his appeal of the 34 felony convictions after Judge Juan Merchan enters his sentencing order on July 11. If the former president is successful in his appeal, his gun rights could be restored."

During peak periods of infection, federal agencies mandated mask-wearing in public places, while many businesses required customers to wear them on the premises.\n\nJean Ryan, president of Disabled In Action of Metropolitan NY does not agree with Maddrey's suggestion, emphasizing masks are a part of \"public safety\" protocol.\n\n\"I will not comply,\" Ryan said. \"I need a mask to protect myself from COVID and other diseases because I am in a high-risk group.\" She continued, \"I understand they want this for public safety but masks also contribute to public safety as well as individual safety.\"\n\nAMNY reports :\n\nCOVID-19 has killed more than 45,000 New Yorkers in the past three years. The most recent state data, from March 1, had 551 people in the hospital for COVID and 73 in the intensive care unit in the five boroughs.\n\nStill, Maddrey believes mask removal could be a key component to future crime prevention.\n\n\"Pre-pandemic, most businesses wouldn't allow you to walk in there with a mask and latex gloves on,\" he said. \"But since the pandemic this is a way of life for us, where people are wearing masks regularly.\"\n\nHe continued, \"But we're seeing this being used too much as a ruse, to enter into businesses and to victimize our businesses.\"\n\nRyan wonders whether \"robbers would even comply\" with the regulation if enforced, according to AMNY.\n\n\"How would they even enforce this request,\" she said. \"It is silly.\"\n\nAM New York's full report is available at this link .

Far-right Fox News pundit Tucker Carlson, the night of April 20, discussed the verdict with Ed Gavin - a former deputy sheriff with the New York City Sheriff's Department - and Carlson brought the interview to an abrupt end when he didn't like Gavin's analysis.\n\nCarlson asked Gavin to weigh in on \"what this means for law enforcement,\" posing the question, \"Who's going to become a cop going forward, do you think?\" Gavin responded, \"I think people will still become police officers. This really is a learning experience for everyone. Let's face it: what we say in that video was pure savagery. I mean, the documentary evidence showed the police officer putting his knee on the perpetrator's neck while he was rear-cuffed and his stomach was on the ground, causing positional asphyxia.\"\n\nGavin continued, \"What I'd like to see is more training for police. I'd like to see the police trained as EMTs, like in the fire department.\"\n\nThe former law enforcement officer went on to say that although he \"used force\" on hundreds of people during his decades in law enforcement, he \"never had anybody go unconscious.\"\n\nGavin told Carlson, \"That was clearly an excessive, unjustified use of force. I think the verdict was just.... It was an open-and-shut case.\"\n\nThat was when Carlson grew angry and defensive, asking Gavin, \"Do we enforce the law?\" And Carlson implied that police will no longer be able to protect the public, telling Gavin, \"The guy who did it looks like he's going to spend the rest of his life in prison. I'm kind of more worried about the rest of the country, which thanks to police inaction - in case you haven't noticed - is like, boarded up. So, that's more my concern.\"\n\nAnd when Gavin tried to speak, Carlson abruptly ended the interview, saying, \"Nope, done.\"\n\nWatch the video below:\n\nEd Gavin Tucker Carlson interview on police training www.youtube.com"

      "text": "How the NYPD Uses Facebook to Surveil, Entrap and Arrest Teenagers\n\nIn October 2012, then-New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly announced a new initiative, called \"Operation Crew Cut,\" which would target gang activity by focusing on so-called street crews. Kelly doubled the size of the anti-gang unit to 300 police officers, assigned to the task of surveilling teenagers on Facebook. Many of these kids are under 18, some as young as 12, and just about all of them are black and brown, from low-income neighborhoods. The officers involved are encouraged to make fake Facebook profiles in order to spy on individuals' Facebook statuses. The operation often entails reading private Facebook messages between friends and is sometimes coupled with phone and video surveillance. Soon press releases were coming out of the NYPD offices announcing dozens of alleged gang members had been arrested due to the Crew Cut initiative. The operation began to draw criticism, however, as people questioned why teenagers were being arrested on obscure conspiracy charges that were meant to take down serious organized crime . One teenager, Jelani Henry , said he was held in Rikers for nearly three years simply because of his associations on Facebook and his likes and comments on various Facebook posts.\n\n\"The mix of social media and conspiracy statutes creates a dragnet that can bring almost anybody in,\" attorney Andrew Laufer told The Verge . \"[I]t's a complete violation of the Fourth Amendment and the worst kind of big brother law enforcement.\"\n\nOn June 4, 2014, the largest NYPD raid in history occurred as a result of Operation Crew Cut. Some of the kids arrested had been surveilled as young as age 12 and four years later were (now, at age 16) charged as adults, and faced dozens of years in prison for allegedly conspiring to commit crimes on Facebook. But it was in the aftermath of the murders of Officer Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos last December that the NYPD found a new purpose for Operation Crew Cut: arresting teenagers, most of them black and Latino, who wrote, shared or liked anti-cop Facebook statuses. The pretext was that the alleged killer of the officers, Ismaaiyl Brinsley, who then committed suicide, had posted his desire to \"put wings on pigs\" on Instagram before setting out to kill cops. Following the murders, NYPD Commissioner William Bratton promised to take social media threats against the police more seriously. New York wasn't alone; overzealous arrests based on anti-cop social media posts were occurring across the country.\n\nIn Fort Worth, Texas, 17-year-old Montrae Toliver was arrested and charged with a terroristic threat for posting a tweet that said, \"should I do it? They don't care for a black man anyways\" along with a photo that appeared to show a gun pointing at a police car. The tweet that followed noted that the gun in the photo was fake and the Associated Press also confirmed that the gun was fake.\n\nIn Massachusetts, a man was charged for writing \"put wings on pigs\" in a Facebook status.\n\nIn Tinton Falls, New Jersey, 29-year-old Matthew Reardon was arrested after expressing his views on Facebook: \"Don't wanna get clipped while sitting in your squad car?? Don't be a [expletives deleted] pig who's looking to get killed...Everyone who goes out of their way to [expletive deleted] with other people should get executed in cold blood.\"\n\nIn Pennsylvania, Steven Drake, 29, is accused of writing a Facebook status saying: \"The police brought this on themselves! I say kill them all! Enough is enough.\" He was charged with terroristic threats and disorderly conduct.\n\nIn Oklahoma City, 19-year-old Tavon Railback was arrested for the Facebook post: \"Bust a some shots at a cop, watch his body fall.\" The post was a remix of the song \"Have It All\" by rappers $wagg and Lil Jojo in which \"opp\" (short for the opposition) was changed to \"cop.\" Railback was charged with violating the Oklahoma Anti-Terrorism Act.\n\nIn New York, the NYPD announced that nearly 30 people were arrested for alleged \"threats against police,\" within a month. One of those arrests was Yasin Shearin, who turned himself in after the Brooklyn district attorney's office put out a call for his arrest because of a Facebook status. The 16-year-old, who had no criminal record, was charged with making terroristic threats and sent to Rikers with a $200,000 bail his mother couldn't pay. During his court date, the prosecutor, citing the criminal complaint, said Shearin's Facebook status was found by an \"officer who investigates youth crews on Facebook,\" or Operation Crew Cut. Devon Coley,18, who was arrested for posting an anti-cop photo with the status \"73next,\" was also being surveilled through Operation Crew Cut. He was charged with making a terroristic threat by the Brooklyn district attorney's office. Neither the county clerk's office or the NYPD would give information on how often arrests like these occur. ** For some lawyers and critics of these police practices, these social media posts are considered dissenting speech. They argue that, while some people may not agree with the statement or find it in bad taste, the speech is still protected by the first amendment. The current case law of what constitutes a \"threat\" includes a specific date or time in the future, as Eugene Volokh wrote in the Washington Post. \"We're going down an interesting road here. I think the police are trying to make people worried,\" Moira Meltzer-Cohen, an attorney who is also a legal activist with Mutant Legal, told AlterNet. \" They don't want people saying negative things about police but the problem is these kinds of laws or the enforcement of laws in these creative ways isn't actually going to prevent people from making real threats against police officers. The danger is it's going to be used - and it looks like it has been already - to punish legitimate dissent that is not a threat.\"\n\nSamuel B. Cohen, a partner at Stecklow Cohen and Thompson who teaches First Amendment law, referenced People v. Stephen (1992) as a \"case...[that] illustrates the tension between the concept of the First Amendment and law enforcement's instinctive desire for respect and obedience...[it] underline[s] the purpose of the First Amendment is to protect people from being penalized for pure speech against police officers.\"\n\nPeople v. Stephen involved an individual being arrested for saying, \"If you didn't have that gun and badge, I'd kick your ass, I'd kill you,\" to a police officer. The charges against the defendant were dismissed. The decision was that while his words may have been \"vulgar, derisive and provocative speech\" - which is protected by the First Amendment - they could not be considered an imminent threat because it was hypothetical and that \"at [its] worst, [his words] counseled unlawful conduct at some future, unspecified time.\"\n\nThereby not making the threat imminent. Furthermore, the case outlines there should be a higher tolerance to speech directed at police since the police are expected \"to be less sensitive to provocation [since] '[t]he freedom of individuals verbally to oppose or challenge police action without thereby risking arrest is one of the principal characteristics by which we distinguish a free nation from a police state.'\" Lawyers who spoke to Buzzfeed came u p with the same conclusion.\n\nBoth Shearin and Coley failed to be indicted on the charges, which seemed to validate many lawyers' viewpoints that the arrests were baseless and even unconstitutional. This result makes NYPD's actions appear even more shady: Why were they using an anti-gang surveillance operation to arrest teenagers for dissenting anti-cop speech? The NYPD declined to comment on the arrests. When asked about the ethics regarding the arrests, a spokesperson from the Brooklyn district attorney's office said only, \"Our standard procedure is to evaluate each case that's brought to us on the merits and bring the appropriate ones to the grand jury.\""

      "text": "NYPD Work Slowdown Results in Massive Drop in Arrests\n\nThere has been a dramatic drop in arrests in New York City after the police union leaders called for an NYPD work \"slowdown.\" According to the New York Post , arrests are down 66% overall, drug arrests are down by 84%, and summons and tickets for minor offenses are down by a mind-blowing 94% since last year.\n\nIronically, protesters and other critics of the NYPD have called for less low-level policing. The end of \"stop-and-frisk\" policing by Police Commissioner Bill Bratton last year was in response to many of these critics. However, Bratton is a proponent of \"broken windows\" policing, the practice of cracking down on minor offenses based on the theory that they create visible signs of public disorder that encourage more serious crimes.\n\nCommunity and minority groups argue that broken-windows policing tends to be racially biased, referring to it as \"the same old stop-and-frisk .\"\n\nIn the wake of the shootings of Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu on December 20, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association and the police unions called for the slowdown, which the Post now equates to a work stoppage. The unions are upset over what they perceive to be anti-police rhetoric by New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and the slowdown is said to be an organized protest. It began the week beginning with December 22, two days after the Ramos and Liu shooting. The Post obtained the figures and compared that week to the corresponding week from a year ago.\n\nThis afternoon, Mayor de Blasio and Police Commissioner Bratton are holding an emergency summit with the leaders of New York's five police unions to try to mend a rift between the city's administration and police rank-and file.\n\nThe PBA and the unions have told their members that their safety comes first and not to make an arrests unless they are \"absolutely necessary.\" Police sources have told the Post that it is these safety measures that are behind the plummet in low-level policing activity. However, the same sources have told the Post that some cops are staging their own work slowdowns as a form of protest over de Blasio's response to a grand jury's decision not to indict the police involved in the chokehold death of Eric Garner in Staten Island.\n\nImmediately after the Ramos and Liu killings, PBA president Patrick Lynch politicized their deaths and pointed blame in the direction of Mayor de Blasio among others.\n\n\"There's blood on many hands tonight: those that incited violence on the street under the guise of protests, that tried to tear down what New York City police officers did every day,\" said Lynch. \"That blood on the hands starts on the steps of City Hall - in the office of the mayor.\"\n\nLynch, who says the NYPD is now a \"wartime police department\" who will \"act accordingly\" had also called on rank-and-file to sign an emotionally manipulative letter that would ban de Blasio from the funerals.\n\nSince Lynch's tirade against De Blasio, the Mayor has faced open hostility from some NYPD police officers and their unions. On Saturday, a cordon of officers standing outside Christ Tabernacle Church turned their backs to the church as de Blasio spoke at the Ramos funeral. The next day, Police Commissioner Bratton denounced the protest of rank-and-file officers, saying that it was inappropriate and highly politicized the funeral.\n\n\"This is a mayor who cares very deeply about New York police officers, cares very deeply about the divide in the city and is working hard to heal that divide,\" Bratton said on CBS This Morning on Sunday."

      "text": "The NYPD Officers Who See Racial Bias in the NYPD\n\nDefenders of the police department too often ignore credible evidence that its treatment of minorities leaves much room for improvement.\n\nA dozen years ago, City Journal , the quarterly magazine of The Manhattan Institute , published \" The Black Cops You Never Hear About \" by Heather Mac Donald, one of the sharpest, most eloquent, and zealous defenders of New York City's police department. As the ACLU and various media outlets claimed racial bias in policing, \"minority officers, who might be considered ideal commentators on these matters,\" are ignored, she wrote. \"So I set out to talk to black cops and commanders from eight police departments across the country about why they became policemen and how they view today's policing controversies. What I found was a bracing commitment to law and order, a resounding rejection of anti-cop propaganda, and a conviction that racial politics are a tragic drag on black progress.\"\n\nAll these years later, it's clear that the conclusions she took from her 2002 reporting don't fully capture the beliefs of many black and Hispanic NYPD officers, as evidenced by many more recent assessments from \"ideal commentators.\"\n\n\"Reuters interviewed 25 African American male officers on the NYPD, 15 of whom are retired and 10 of whom are still serving,\" the news organization reported in a recent article. \"All but one said that, when off duty and out of uniform, they had been victims of racial profiling, which refers to using race or ethnicity as grounds for suspecting someone of having committed a crime,\" the small survey found. \"Officers said this included being pulled over for no reason, having their heads slammed against their cars, getting guns brandished in their faces, being thrown into prison vans and experiencing stop and frisks while shopping.\" These weren't one-off events. \"The majority of the officers said they had been pulled over multiple times while driving. Five had had guns pulled on them.\"\n\nA third of those officers say that they complained to supervisors. \"All but one said their supervisors either dismissed the complaints or retaliated against them by denying them overtime, choice assignments, or promotions,\" the story notes. \"The remaining officers who made no complaints said they refrained either because they feared retribution or because they saw racial profiling as part of the system.\"\n\nIn any other context, conservative commentators would jump on a credible report from 24 public employees within a single bureaucracy, all alleging serious, systemic misconduct by rank-and-file workers (enabled or encouraged by lax supervisors). But the Reuters report was all but ignored by right-leaning sites that generally side with the police in the culture wars, as if support for Broken Windows policing and disdain for Al Sharpton somehow requires one to ignore or dismiss allegations of racial bias and a culture of retaliating against whistleblowers. It is myopic to do so given how closely the allegations dovetail with past critiques.\n\nBefore Officer Pedro Serrano joined the NYPD he says he was unfairly targeted by its officers. \"As a Hispanic walking in the Bronx, I've been stopped many times, and it's not a good feeling,\" he told CNN last year . \"As an officer, I said I would respect everyone to the best of my abilities. I just want to do the right thing.\" After 9 years in uniform, he cited his youthful experience as a motivating factor in his decision to report a superior for ordering him to target \"male blacks 14 to 21\" for stop-and-frisks. \"So what am I supposed to do: Stop every black and Hispanic?\" Serrano said in a conversation that he simultaneously recorded on a hidden audio tape. \"I have no problem telling you this,\" his superior replied. \"Male blacks. And I told you at roll call, and I have no problem to tell you this, male blacks 14 to 21.\"\n\nIt's on tape.\n\nIn 2012, when Detective Debra Lawson brought a lawsuit in Brooklyn Federal Court alleging that minorities in her NYPD unit were passed over for promotion, her colleague, Detective Al Hawkins, testified that a superior regularly used the n-word, saying on one occasion, \"If you have to shoot a nigger, do what you gotta do.\" Another colleague, Detective Gregory Jean-Baptiste, said he was called \"a black bastard.\"\n\nThe testimony also included an anonymous retired detective who alleged that a superior officer said of minority suspects, \"They are fucking animals. You make sure if you have to shoot, you shoot them in the head. That way there's one story,\" and that on raids in black neighborhoods, his superiors \"didn't care if it was kids in there, they didn't care if it was women in there, naked women... They treated them as if they had no rights whatsoever. It was disgusting.\" One can either credit these allegations, or believe that three NYPD officers conspired to lie under oath.\n\nEither way it doesn't look good for the NYPD!\n\nWhen Douglas Zeigler was 60, he was one of the highest ranking commanders in the NYPD. Though he was approached while in an NYPD SUV with a police ID around his neck, the black man declared that he was harassed without reason and treated discourteously by white police officers, one of whom was ultimately disciplined . (Again, there's no outcome in which at least one NYPD officer wasn't lying.)\n\nThe Village Voice did its own 2012 article on the experiences of black and Hispanic police officers.\n\nSome excerpts:\n\nThe testimony of these \"ideal commentators\" is consistent with other accounts of how the NYPD operates. Take the secret tapes made by Adrian Schoolcraft to document how one of the city's blackest neighborhoods was policed. \"Supervisors told officers to make an arrest and 'articulate' a charge later, or haul someone in with the intent of voiding the arrest at the end of a shift, or detain people for hours on minor charges like disorderly conduct-all for the purpose of getting citizens off the street,\" the Village Voice reported in its summary of the recordings. \"People were arrested for not showing identification, even if they were just a few feet from their homes. Mental health worker Rhonda Scott suffered two broken wrists during a 2008 arrest for not having her ID card while standing on her own stoop.\" (The NYPD then tried to have that whistleblower committed to a mental institution and later accused him of using the n-word . If Schoolcraft really did say that around colleagues, note that the slur was only treated as discrediting by superiors after he publicly complained about the NYPD.)\n\nThen there's Michael Daragjati, the former NYPD police officer who said of black New Yorkers, \"These people should hate me, and rightfully so. I would hate me too, because I've seen the news. I don't blame these people for hating cops.\" He wasn't a black cop who experienced mistreatment by colleagues. He was a white cop who mistreated blacks. \"On April 15, 2011, Daragjati falsely busted Kenrick Gray, 32, on a charge of resisting arrest after they exchanged angry words on the street while the officer was on plainclothes patrol,\" the New York Post reported . \"After Gray's arrest, FBI agents caught Daragjati on a recorded phone call bragging that he 'fried another nigger.' Gray spent two days in jail. He is now suing Daragjati, who was sentenced yesterday to nine months in prison for violating Gray's civil rights.\"\n\nMuslim Americans have been treated unfairly by NYPD policing too. Two years ago, I wrote about how the NYPD's ethnic profiling and undercover surveillance of innocents in that community violated their civil liberties and did serious harm to their well-being. Was the effort nevertheless necessary to thwart terrorist attacks? Hardly. \"In more than six years of spying on Muslim neighborhoods, eavesdropping on conversations and cataloguing mosques,\" the Associated Press reported , \"the New York Police Department's secret Demographics Unit never generated a lead or triggered a terrorism investigation.\" In fact, New York City attorneys later acknowledged, in court testimony, that the program generated zero leads. NYPD apologists can't explain this away as policing where the crime was.\n\nThe examples I've cited all occurred in the years since Mac Donald offered her rosy portrait of what black officers think of the NYPD. Yet her latest assessment of the NYPD, published last month, neither acknowledges nor grapples with the new information. \"Hatred of the police among blacks stems in part from police brutality during this country's shameful era of Jim Crow-laws and widespread discrimination,\" she writes. \"But it is naïve not to recognize that criminal members of the black underclass despise the police because law enforcement interferes with their way of life. The elites are oblivious both to the extent of lawlessness in the black inner city and to its effect on attitudes toward the cops. Any expression of contempt for the police, in their view, must be a sincere expression of a wrong.\"\n\nIn this telling, recent NYPD misconduct is not even a factor! Mac Donald is right that the NYPD is less racist than it once was, that there are plenty of non-racist NYPD cops, that there are black criminals (along with criminals of other races) whose hatred of the NYPD is driven by a lawless subculture, and that there is irresponsible commentary that exaggerates NYPD racism and understates NYPD progress.\n\nBut the 90 percent of black voters who say that police brutality is a \"very serious\" or \"somewhat serious\" problem, the 59 percent of black New Yorkers who disapprove of the way the NYPD is doing its job, and the 81 percent of black New Yorkers who believe the NYPD is tougher on blacks than whites cannot be explained away by gesturing at a criminal mindset. Millions of law abiding people share these critiques. Is all contempt for police a sincere expression of a wrong? Of course not. There are, however, lots of credible accounts of wrongdoing. It takes a selective eye indeed to set forth an account of black sentiment toward the NYPD that does not acknowledge any examples found in this article.\n\nAnd despite the evidence of racial bias in New York City policing, the majority of people who disapprove of how the NYPD is doing its job don't actually \"hate\" or \"despise\" the NYPD. They just desperately want it to be reformed so that bad policing is documented and punished rather than being ignored or covered up. Conservatives could argue that race isn't actually the core of the problem, that the culture of unpunished misbehavior in the NYPD is driven by, say, the tribal mindset documented by Frank Serpico much more than any deliberate desire to disadvantage blacks. But too many NYPD defenders refuse to acknowledge widespread misbehavior of any kind . (If they saw Anthony Balonga pepper-spray innocent women for no reason you'd never know.) Even as police engage in blatant insubordination at the behest of a powerful public employee union that frequently misrepresents the truth, City Journal's Matthew Hennessey writes as if the urgent issue is hypocrisy by NYPD critics. It is unthinkable that the publication would portray a similar controversy involving any other public employee union in this way. Its tribal affiliations in the culture war are clouding its judgment.\n\nThat is nowhere more evident than in Mac Donald's \" The Big Lie of the Anti-Cop Left Turns Lethal ,\" published after the disgusting murder of two NYPD officers. The distinction between criticizing and despising public employees is clear to Mac Donald and City Journal in reporting on every other kind of government worker, even though, if one highlights the most intemperate critics of teacher's unions or DMV workers or IRS processors, it is easy to find extremely harsh  rhetoric. City Journal and its writers are appropriately scornful of the rhetorical move whereby any criticism of, say, teachers is twisted into an \"attack on our educators\" narrative. If a teacher's union staged a public school walkout or a work slowdown because they felt disrespected by the rhetoric of a politician like Michelle Rhee, conservatives would be apoplectic that they shirked their duties to play politics.\n\nYet in the course of defending the NYPD, the right is now lending credibility to the notion that harsh but totally nonviolent criticism of public employees makes one partly responsible if they are attacked by a lunatic-as well as the idea that public employees who feel disrespected by elected officials ought to be appeased with an apology . As City Journal takes well-desserved shots at Sharpton, condemns the rare protestors who disgustingly chant for dead cops, and publishes plausible defenses of Broken Windows policing , it would do well to start regarding misbehaving police with as much concern as it routinely marshals for misbehaving teachers, rather than proceeding as if cops are the one category of public employees who can do no wrong, despite ample evidence to the contrary and even as police unions openly intervene to keep the worst cops from being terminated .\n\nA publication with a proud history of urging necessary reforms in New York City ought to be on the front lines of improving its scandal-prone police department and protecting the Fourth Amendment rights of innocents, rather than overlooking all manner of misdeeds so long as crime rates are low. At the very least, it should stop acting as if those who do criticize misbehaving police officers are any more responsible for the extremely rare instances in which they're murdered than City Journal would be responsible for an assault on a representative from the California Teacher's Association . For good reason, City Journal authors bristle at the propagandistic notion that they are \"attacking all teachers.\" Neither are police reform advocates attacking all officers , not any more than black and brown men with badges who say racial bias exists in New York City. NYPD defenders believe that further crime reductions can only occur if police are afforded a larger degree of respect. They ought to dedicate some time and energy to reforming the police department so that it is more respectable.\n\n* Consider the fact that the overwhelming majority of Stop-and-Frisk encounters involve people who've committed no crime and are sent on their way without arrest or citation. NYPD defenders are fond of arguing that every statistic about racial disparities in arrests and stops are explained by the fact that blacks tend to live in more dangerous neighborhoods and commit crimes at higher rates. What of the large majority of blacks who are following the law when police mass in their neighborhood? Their liberties seem to be regarded as collateral damage.\n\nIn fact, police who mass in the same neighborhood day after day have a heightened responsibility to make sure that their attempt to catch criminals and increase order doesn't continually violate the rights of innocent residents-the NYPD is, after all, obliged to abide by the Fourth Amendment. They make a mockery of \"reasonable suspicion\" when the people they purportedly suspect are doing no wrong 8 or 9 times out of ten. How many times would you need to be stopped and frisked while doing no wrong to develop resentment of the officers detaining you? NYPD defenders never assign any responsibility for the rift that results to police, even though any community of any race subject to Stop and Frisk would resent it. Imagine how Wall Street bankers would react if subjected to it for a single week."

      "text": "Why the NYPD Turned Its Back on the City\n\nDoes believing the police are constantly under fire serve a productive function for society?\n\nOn Sunday, a relatively large group of New York police officers, sworn to protect and serve the public, turned their back on the public's elected executive, Mayor Bill de Blasio :\n\nThe show of disrespect came outside the funeral home where Officer Wenjian Liu was remembered as an incarnation of the American dream: a man who had immigrated at age 12 and devoted himself to helping others in his adopted country. The gesture, among officers watching the mayor's speech on a screen, added to tensions between the mayor and rank-and-file police even as he sought to quiet them.\n\nThis particular protest came after Commissioner William Bratton asked them not to stage a repeat of Officer Rafael Ramos's funeral. This request included the telling caveat, \"I issue no mandates, and I make no threats of discipline, but I remind you that when you don the uniform of this department, you are bound by the tradition, honor and decency that go with it.\"\n\nIt's not clear that Bratton could (or should) do much of anything to stop his officers from protesting. But whatever Bratton's sense of honor and decency, it clearly isn't shared by the officers working under him, and it's unlikely that his appeal swayed anyone.\n\nThose who are demoralized by these protests would do well to read James Fallows's cover story on the American military this month. The same cloak of puffed grandeur and bombast that surrounds our army can be detected in our police. Jim is describing a society that has taken its hands off the wheel. Give us safety now (real or imagined), goes the agreement, and we won't ask about what comes later. Until some critical mass of Americans decides that police cannot, all at once, wield the lethal power of gods and the meager responsibilities of mortals, change is unlikely.\n\nAnd it always was. If the public appetite for police reform can be soured by the mad acts of a man living on the edge of society, then the appetite was probably never really there to begin with. And the police, or at least their representatives, know this. In this piece , by Wesley Lowery, there are several amazing moments where police complain about things Barack Obama and Eric Holder have not actually said. There simply is no level of critique they would find tolerable. Why take criticism when you don't actually have to? Better to remind the public that you are the only thing standing between them and the barbarians at the gate:\n\n\"We might be reaching a tipping point with the mind-set of officers, who are beginning to wonder if the risks they take to keep communities safe are even worth it anymore,\" Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke said. \"In New York and other places, we're seeing a natural recoil from law enforcement officers who don't feel like certain people who need to have their backs.\"\n\nHere's Radley Balko quantifying those \"risks\" police officers face:\n\nPolicing has been getting safer for 20 years. In terms of raw number of deaths, 2013 was the safest year for cops since World War II. If we look at the rate of deaths, 2013 was the safest year for police in well over a century .... You're more likely to be murdered simply by living in about half of the largest cities in America than you are while working as a police officer.\n\nNearly half of those deaths are from automobile accidents. Balko is somewhat frustrated that despite the empirical facts around policing, nothing seems to penetrate the narrative of police living under constant threat. Why? Is it that most people are just basically ignorant of the information? Is it that most people just believe, uncritically, what police officers tell them?\n\nOr is there something more? Forgive me. I have not yet fully worked this all out. But Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn describes the prisoners headed to the Soviet Gulag as waves flowing underground. These waves \"provided sewage disposal for the life flowering on the surface.\" I understand this to mean that the gulag was not just mindless evil-was not just incomprehensible insanity-but served some sort of productive and knowable purpose.\n\nCould it be that believing our police to be constantly under fire is not mysterious-that it serves some productive function, that society actually derives something from its peace officers engaged in forever war? And can we say that the function of the war here at home is not simply a response to violent crime (which has plunged) but to some other need? And knowing that identity is not simply defined by what we are, but what we are not, can it be that our police help give us identity, by branding one class of people as miscreants, outsiders, and thugs, and thus establishing some other class as upstanding, as citizens, as Americans? Does the feeling of being besieged serve some actual purpose?\n\nI am not sure this is all correct. But if the direction is right, then it becomes possible to understand the NYPD's protest (and the toothless admonitions of the commissioner) not as mindless petulance, but as something systemic, as a natural outgrowth of our needs."

      "text": "The NYPD's Insubordination-and Why the Right Should Oppose It\n\nThe virtual work stoppage unfolding in New York City illustrates one of several ways that powerful police unions can threaten public safety as they seek political leverage.\n\nIn New York City, \" NYPD traffic tickets and summonses for minor offenses have dropped off by a staggering 94 percent following the execution of two cops ,\" the New York Post reports , attributing the \"virtual work stoppage\" to rank-and-file police officers who \"feel betrayed by the mayor and fear for their safety.\"\n\nThe statistics cited suggest significant solidarity among cops. Overall arrests rates fell 66 percent \"for the week starting Dec. 22 compared with the same period in 2013, stats show. Citations for traffic violations fell by 94 percent, from 10,069 to 587, during that time frame. Summonses for low-level offenses like public drinking and urination also plunged 94 percent-from 4,831 to 300. Even parking violations are way down, dropping by 92 percent, from 14,699 to 1,241.\"\n\nAs a ploy in contract negotiations, this tactic may prove effective, but it puts the NYPD in an unenviable position with respect to explaining what happens next. If this significant work slowdown has basically no effect on the safety of New York City, the NYPD's prior policing will appear to have been needlessly aggressive, and the case for deploying more cops on the street in the future will be undermined. Scott Shackford zeroes in on this line from the Post article: \"... cops were turning a blind eye to some minor crimes and making arrests only 'when they have to' since the execution-style shootings of Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu.\"\n\nHe riffs:\n\nWell, we can only hope the NYPD unions and de Blasio settle their differences soon so that the police can go back to arresting people for reasons other than \"when they have to.\" The NYPD's failure to arrest and cite people will also end up costing the city huge amounts of money that it won't be able to seize from its citizens, which is likely the real point. That's the \"punishment\" for the de Blasio administration for not supporting them. One has to wonder if they even understand, or care, that their \"work stoppage\" is giving police state critics exactly what they want-less harsh enforcement of the city's laws.\n\nThat's how some policing reformers see it. Others, like me, don't object to strictly enforcing laws against, say, public urination, traffic violations, or illegal parking, but would love it if the NYPD stopped frisking innocents without probable cause or even reasonable suspicion, needlessly escalating encounters with civilians, and (especially) killing unarmed people, goals that are perfectly compatible with data-driven policing that targets actual disorder. Keep squeegee men at bay-and leave innocent black and Hispanic men alone.\n\nWhat if the \"broken windows\" theory is correct and the work slowdown causes an increase in disorder and thus more serious crime? The NYPD will have put the safety and perhaps even the lives of New Yorkers in jeopardy to punish a politician for purportedly disrespecting them. Such a course might succeed in decreasing de Blasio's popularity. But the public is unlikely to think that willfully putting New Yorkers in jeopardy to settle a political score is a forgivable tactic. It is certainly at odds with the notion that NYPD officers represent \"New York's finest,\" heroes who willingly sacrifice themselves to protect and serve.\n\nDue to de Blasio's progressive politics and the political right's reflexive \"law and order\" alliance with police, many conservatives are siding with the NYPD in its standoff with de Blasio. AlterNet reports that it has emails \"revealing plans to organize a series of anti-de Blasio protests around the city\" that are \"billed as a non-partisan movement in support of 'the men and women of the NYPD'\" but actually orchestrated \"by a cast of NYPD union bosses and local Republican activists allied with Rudy Giuliani.\" The first rally is planned for January 13.\n\nThe right should greet it with the skepticism they'd typically summon for a rally on behalf of government workers as they seek higher pay, new work rules, and more generous benefits. What's unfolding in New York City is, at its core, a public-employee union using overheated rhetoric and emotional appeals to rile public employees into insubordination. The implied threat to the city's elected leadership and electorate is clear: Cede leverage to the police in the course of negotiating labor agreements or risk an armed, organized army rebelling against civilian control. Such tactics would infuriate the right if deployed by any bureaucracy save law enforcement opposing a left-of-center mayor.\n\nIt ought to infuriate them now. Instead, too many are permitting themselves to be baited into viewing discord in New York City through the distorting lens of the culture war, so much so that Al Sharpton's name keeps coming up as if he's at the center of all this. Poppycock. Credit savvy police union misdirection. They're turning conservatives into their useful idiots. If the NYPD succeeds in bullying de Blasio into submission, the most likely consequence will be a labor contract that cedes too much to union negotiators, whether unsustainable pensions of the sort that plague local finances all over the U.S., work rules that prevent police commanders from running the department efficiently, or arbitration rules that prevent the worst cops from being fired . Meanwhile, Al Sharpton will be fine no matter what happens. Will the law-and-order right remain blinded by tribalism or grasp the real stakes before it's too late? Look to National Review and City Journal before laying odds."

      "text": "The Lawlessness That Cops Ignore\n\nIn New York, a failure to take quality-of-life complaints seriously reveals a city unaccountable to its residents.\n\nA glimpse of my phone's photo roll: cherubic child proudly displaying the treats he snuck into the grocery basket; black sedan with no license plates; kid in restaurant sticking his tongue out; red Nissan Altima with Florida plates blocking crosswalk; child posing with friend on Coney Island boardwalk; white Chevy Suburban with New York City Transit Authority parking placard blocking fire hydrant.\n\nThe child is mine. Those photos are mostly for Grandma. The vehicles are not mine. Those photos are for 311, which bills itself as \"New York City's main source of government information and non-emergency services.\" The 311 reports I file are my way of protesting the city's post-pandemic takeover by private automobiles (more than 100,000 newly registered vehicles clogging our streets and pushing traffic deaths up to numbers not seen in a decade). But-as is so often the case-my protest has been a largely ineffectual one.\n\nAt its best, 311 gives the citizen a very clear example of city government working for them. Pothole? No heat in your building? Need help navigating SNAP or other benefits? Rats? Call the city, and someone will assist. When the system works, it's a miracle of responsive local government. When it doesn't, and these days it doesn't, it highlights the places, people, and recurring problems our government would rather ignore.\n\nT his summer, the New York City Council's Committee on Oversight and Investigations  looked into the NYPD's handling of 311 service requests. Its investigators filed 311 reports on 50 observed examples of illegal parking throughout the city. \"In each case,\" the council wrote in a letter to NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea, \"NYPD claimed to properly respond and marked the SR as closed. But for 72% (36) of these SRs, our team observed that NYPD did not properly respond.\" Mainly, officers would drive or walk past the reported vehicle without doing anything. The NYPD did not respond in any way to 14 of the requests, despite officially claiming to have done so.\n\nBrian Klaas: Focus on who police are, not what they do\n\nFurthermore, the city-council investigation found that the NYPD has started \"responding to\" reports of improper use of city-issued parking placards with improbable alacrity: From 2019 to 2020, the percentage of such service requests closed in less than 15 minutes quadrupled.\n\nSubsequent investigations by Streetsblog , a newsroom operated by the pro-transit nonprofit OpenPlans, found that thousands of driver-misconduct service reports were closed in less than five minutes, \"up from only five such complaints that were closed so quickly in 2010,\" and-more worrying-that a few frequent reporters of parking violations or driver misconduct were subject to intimidating anonymous phone calls and texts from people who may have been cops. (After I read this story, I stopped ticking the box to include my contact information with my complaints.)\n\nHere are some of the responses I've gotten to my 311 reports recently: \"The Police Department responded and upon arrival those responsible for the condition were gone.\" \"The Police Department responded to the complaint and determined that police action was not necessary.\" \"The Police Department responded to the complaint and with the information available observed no evidence of the violation at that time.\"\n\nJust once in my pandemic-era 311-complaint spree have I notched a verified win. I reported a hydrant-blocking car before turning in for the night. I woke up the next morning to this response: \"The Police Department issued a summons in response to the complaint.\" And the car actually did have a summons on it, which I knew because it was still parked right there in front of the hydrant. A week later, I reported the same placarded Chevy Suburban in the exact same space. This one got closed with a \"took action to fix the condition\" response, and sometime later I watched the driver depart without penalty. (Asked about the 311 investigations, and my own closed service requests, Mayor Bill de Blasio's office forwarded me comments he had made at a press conference earlier this year in which he said he would be \"directing the NYPD to ensure that every one of these complaints is followed up on.\" The city's Department of Investigation confirmed that it is \"actively investigating\" the harassment claims.)\n\nI am, admittedly, a crank. But I'm not a busybody. The complaints I file are legitimate matters of public safety. The hydrant is in front of my apartment building, and the no-standing zone where I reported the illegal truck is in the bike path directly leading to my kid's elementary school. The widespread, institutional failure to take these sorts of complaints seriously reveals a city unaccountable to its residents. And that unaccountability is disquieting: It suggests that many public servants don't see themselves as servants of the public at all.\n\nP resident Lyndon B. Johnson's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice suggested a single national phone number for emergency calls in 1967. AT&T announced 911 as the designated emergency code the next year, though the system (run largely by county governments) would take decades to reach most Americans. By the 1990s, 911 was often treated as a victim of its own success. Call volume was too high, and too many calls were nonemergencies. Meanwhile, police departments resented being judged based on their response times to emergency calls, and insisted it distracted from \"community policing.\"\n\nRead: How to actually fix America's police\n\nThe problem of police departments inundated with mundane calls made good fodder both for local news and for Democratic Party law-and-order politics. On the campaign trail in 1996, Bill Clinton called for the creation of a national nonemergency number-a \" national community policing number ,\" actually-to ease the strain on overburdened 911 emergency lines.\n\nWhen Baltimore launched a nonemergency-number pilot program in October of that year, the city settled on 311, choosing a number in line with the easy-to-remember \"N11\" codes Americans were already used to dialing to reach emergency services or get phone-directory assistance. (Other cities tried the opposite approach. A Buffalo, New York, ad agency created this catchy slogan for its city's nonemergency hotline: \"For a real emergency, call 911; we'll quickly send someone! Nonemergencies, it's 853-2222, and we'll tell you what to do.\")\n\nA few years later, Michael Bloomberg, in his first term as mayor of New York City, set up what would become the nation's largest 311 operation. But he didn't pitch it as an effort to cure citizens of their depraved addiction to dialing 911. He didn't even claim that it would significantly reduce 911-call volumes. His 311 was a hotline for city services in general, not simply a number for nonemergency police calls. This shift in rationale for 311 boosted Bloomberg's carefully crafted image as a results-oriented, technocratic manager who'd get the city government to simply work. This vision of 311 also reflected a long political tradition of urban good-government reform progressivism. To directly reach your government for assistance or to access services would no longer require having connections to the local party boss, or even necessarily contacting your elected representatives. Every city resident-even every tourist!-now had a direct line to the city government, and the government now had robust data on how efficiently it was serving its denizens.\n\nBloomberg's first major initiative turned out to be one of his most lasting and most effective, in New York and nationwide. His vision of a general-purpose 311 number won out over Clinton's community-policing number, and versions of it now exist in most large American cities and a growing number of small ones.\n\nThanks to that proliferation, 311 now reveals breakdowns in accountability and the limits of state capacity all across the nation.\n\nC alls to 311 about an illegal trash-dumping site in northeast Houston were closed out with no action taken until the local news channel ABC13 devoted a segment to it , garnering the attention of the mayor and even Representative Sheila Jackson Lee. City crews cleaned it up the day after the segment aired. The city can track calls about illegal dumping, but it has no system for ensuring that tasks delegated to city agencies are completed.\n\nWhen rats began invading an elderly woman's San Antonio home from the vacant and dilapidated house next door, her daughter made one of the several 311 reports made about the abandoned property. All were closed without action being taken. \"I think that ... sometimes closed does not mean 'resolved,'\" the city's 311 director told the local television station KSAT. \"There are different reasons for closure, and I think that that is something that we are definitely working on with the community, to understand the nuances between the two.\"\n\nPhiladelphia's Action News station carried out a small-scale sting of the city's 311 system similar to those carried out in New York. They filed 22 reports on the sort of small-scale quality-of-life issues a well-run city government should be able to address, such as abandoned vehicles and broken sidewalks. After four months, four tickets remained open and unfixed, and nine had been improperly closed. The city's Streets Department gets tens of thousands of complaints annually, the station reports. The data revolution in American governance can now quantify the extent to which that department is unable, for whatever reasons, to carry out its mission.\n\nT he criminologists and police officials who pioneered the \"broken-windows theory\" argued that seemingly nonviolent but highly visible signs of lawlessness and disorder, such as graffiti and those titular broken windows, create environments that themselves promote worse disorder. That logic was used to justify years of stop-and-frisk and other aggressive crackdowns. But those same advocates rarely apply their logic to the sorts of lawlessness that police abide and that the state is uninterested in addressing. No one is willing to demonstrate to the public that the streets are under control by getting the cop's personal vehicle off the sidewalk.\n\nFrom the September 2020 issue: Incremental change is a moral failure\n\nCynicism born of experience leads many to scoff at the notion that local governments would bother to improve day-to-day life even if they could. Many of my neighbors wouldn't think to alert the city to an illegally parked semitruck on a road leading to an elementary school, because that is simply how the roads have always been here (even if the situation has recently gotten worse) and there is no evidence the city has the appetite or ability to change it.\n\nThis cynicism is not limited to urban politics. It probably explains a kind of national resignation about the possibility of positive change. New Yorkers watched, in real time, former Governor Andrew Cuomo become a celebrated national figure as he improvised and largely botched the state's response to the traumatic first wave of COVID-19 last year. His lionization makes sense only if no one really expects anyone in power to do things such as manage public health. In this context, going on television to offer comfort is enough.\n\n\"Please contact 311\" has become a running joke among New York urbanists, used on Twitter in response to scenes of absurd auto congestion or dangerous driving. It derives from the city's Department of Transportation, which has a Twitter account staffed with real people who reply to seemingly every specific, detailed complaint about the streets with that exhortation. Please contact a middleman agency to generate a ticket to instruct my agency to do its job, which we all expect will not get done anyway. Once the pothole is transformed into data, the city can clear it. Whether anyone will fill the physical pothole is a question for another department."

United States ; they continue to deploy this rhetoric of injured innocence. For example, last year, District Judge William Martini dismissed a lawsuit by a group of Muslim Americans against the New York Police Department. In the years between 2001 and 2011, the department engaged in systematic surveillance of the Muslim community in New York and on the East Coast.\n\nConsider the facts before the court: In 2011 and 2012, the AP revealed the details of a program as focused as the Japanese Internment-a special \"Demographics Unit\" of the NYPD, set up after 9/11 and managed with the help of an on-loan CIA officer. The unit systematically targeted Muslims of any origin (even \"American Black Muslims\"), for systematic surveillance-even without any indication of disloyalty or criminal activity. NYPD \"rakers\" were sent into Muslim communities, student groups, mosques, and businesses to gather background on everyone involved. The target was religion: When investigating the Syrian or Egyptian communities, for example, the units specifically excluded Syrian Jews or Coptic Christians.\n\nNYPD officials denied the existence of the program; but it was hardly secret in the target neighborhoods. Strange men loitered in front of Muslim businesses, and new surveillance cameras appeared, focusing on the entrances to places of worship. As a result, some customers stayed away from the bakeries and butcher shops; attendance fell at the mosques; meetings of student groups thinned out. The chill was felt up and down the East Coast; the unit didn't limit itself to the five boroughs.\n\nBut, Martini said, the police-like the military authorities who locked up the internees during World War II-had nothing against Muslims. They just thought that, because they were Muslims, they might be terrorists. \"Plaintiffs have not alleged facts from which it can plausible inferred that they were targeted because of their religion.\" No, it was something completely different, he wrote: \"the motive for the Program was not solely to discriminate against Muslims, but rather to find Muslim terrorists hiding among ordinary law-abiding Muslims.\"\n\nLast week, the U.S. Court of Appeals reversed Martini's slipshod opinion . The case may end up in front of the Supreme Court; but even if the Court finds a reason to reverse, I will still assign the Third Circuit opinion to my students as a model of how a careful judge analyzes a difficult constitutional claim. (Judge Thomas L. Ambro wrote the opinion for a three-judge panel. Ambro and Judge Julio M. Fuentes are both Clinton appointees, and Judge Jane Richards Roth is a George H.W. Bush appointee.)\n\nThe NYPD had prevailed on two main arguments. First, it contended, the program hadn't hurt the Muslim plaintiffs at all. They weren't arrested, punished, or denied any \"tangible benefit.\" But, said the panel, \"those not on discrimination's receiving end can all too easily gloss over the 'badge of inferiority' inflicted by unequal treatment itself. Closing our eyes to the real and ascertainable harms of discrimination inevitably leads to morning-after regret.\"\n\nOkay, but if there was injury, the department added, the guilty party was the AP, not the NYPD. The AP's expose won the Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting in 2012-but if it hadn't revealed the NYPD's secret, the plaintiffs wouldn't have known about it. \"In short, [the Department] argues, 'What you don't know can't hurt you,'\" the panel explained. \"'And, if you do know, don't shoot us. Shoot the messenger.'\" But that plow won't scour: \"The discrimination itself,\" not the revelation of it, \"is the legally cognizable injury.\" Finally, the city relied on Martini's reasoning that the program wasn't aimed at hurting Muslims, but at preventing \"Muslim terrorist activities.\"\n\nMany lawyers, and some judges, seem to believe that discrimination only counts when it flows from what's called \"invidious motive\"-that is, hatred or scorn. Since the cops didn't hate Muslims, it was okay that they singled them out for surveillance and investigation. The city, said the panel, \"wrongly assumes that invidious motive is a necessary element of discriminatory intent. It is not. All you need is that the state actor meant to single out a plaintiff because of the protected characteristic itself ... Thus, even if the NYPD officers were subjectively motivated by a legitimate law-enforcement purpose (no matter how sincere), they've intentionally discriminated if they wouldn't have surveilled Plaintiffs had they not been Muslim.\"\n\nThis lesson about discrimination is one the nation needs to learn over and over. During the litigation over same-sex marriage, for example, some lawyers (and even some judges) argued that excluding same-sex couples was okay because it wasn't done out of bigotry-just a desire to keep marriage for heterosexual couples. That, however, is discrimination; hatred isn't required.\n\nIn all equal-protection cases, courts must consider how hurtful and dangerous a specific type of discrimination is. Age, for example, isn't viewed with sharp disfavor; even brilliant 15-year-olds can be denied a driver's license. Race and national origin, however, are to be given a hard look-what courts call \"strict scrutiny\"; sex and a few others get \"intermediate scrutiny,\" almost as searching.\n\nThe Supreme Court has never set a \"scrutiny\" level for religion; the opinion doesn't choose between \"strict\" and \"intermediate,\" but holds that such discrimination requires some level higher than, say, age. (Judge Roth rather tartly wrote a short concurrence to point out that since sex discrimination gets only \"intermediate\" scrutiny, maybe religion should too.) \"The history of religious discrimination in the United States,\" the panel opinion said, \"is intertwined with that based on other protected characteristics, including national origin and race.\"\n\nAll told, the opinion strikes a blow for common sense. There's no claim that investigation and vigilance are not, and were not, needed; but it should put security forces-local, state, and federal-on notice that compiling lists by religion is not the place to begin. \"We have been down similar roads before,\" the panel wrote. \"Jewish-Americans during the Red Scare, African-Americans during the Civil Rights Movement, and Japanese during World War II are examples that spring readily to mind.\" Quoting one of the Japanese exclusion cases, it concluded, \"We are left to wonder why we cannot see with foresight what we see so clearly with hindsight-that 'loyalty is a matter of the heart and mind[,] not race, creed, or color.'\""

      "text": "An NYPD Unit Armed to Face Terrorists-and Protesters\n\nThe militarization of police intensifies in New York City.\n\nNYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton intends to create a new unit of police officers specially trained to use heavy weaponry. They'll be equipped with \"extra heavy protective gear, with the long rifles and machine guns,\" he said during a Thursday press conference. As a critic of militarized police forces, I must acknowledge that New York City and Washington, D.C., by virtue of their status as prime terrorist targets, can justify counterterrorism training and weaponry that would be absurd elsewhere, which isn't to say that this heavily armed, 350-person squad is a no-brainer. It isn't as if such a unit would've stopped the attacks in Boston or 9/11 or Oklahoma City-or the terrorist attack in Paris, or the ones some years ago in Madrid or London.\n\nThe benefit to such a squad is its ability to respond to an attack like the ones in Mumbai or Nairobi, where heavily armed gunmen seize a building with many hostages. The cost is the danger that the militarized unit will be turned on U.S. citizens.\n\nAlas, that worst-case scenario seems to be Bratton's plan. The unit, dubbed a Strategic Response Group, is \"designed for dealing with events like our recent protests, or incidents like Mumbai or what just happened in Paris ,\" Bratton declared , giving no sign of recognizing that one of those things is unlike the others.\n\nThe NYPD has a history of violently suppressing protests.\n\nAn investigation undertaken by law clinics at NYU, Fordham, Harvard, and Stanford concluded, after eight months of study, that the NYPD abused Occupy Wall Street protesters and violated their rights on numerous occasions during the 2011 protests that radiated out from Zuccotti Park. Their report is titled Suppressing Protest: Human Rights Violations in the U.S. Response to Occupy Wall Street .\n\nIn a 2012 article, I noted 14 specific allegations of abuse .\n\nLast year, the New York Civil Liberties Union declared victory in its lengthy attempt to seek redress for some of the NYPD abuses perpetrated during protests in 2004: \"New York City has agreed to pay nearly $18 million for the arrest, detention and fingerprinting of hundreds of protesters, journalists, legal observers and bystanders during the 2004 Republican National Convention - the largest protest settlement in history. The NYCLU filed the first cases following the Convention and has been central to the legal challenge to the NYPD's actions.\"\n\nWhen the unit trained to fight terrorists with heavy weapons is sent to face unarmed New Yorkers exercising their right to free assembly, hopefully they'll wield their machine guns more responsibly than Anthony Balonga did his pepper spray:\n\nOther changes announced by Bratton are more promising :\n\nUnder a plan created by chief of department James O'Neill, the NYPD will cut the number of officers assigned to specialty roles, and increase the number of officers on patrol in local precincts. \"We'll assign them to steady sectors,\" Bratton said. \"Having more patrol officers and sector cars lessens the tyranny of the radio and allows time for new, creative types of police work.\"\n\n...this pilot program is similar to one he began rolling out when he was an officer working in Boston in the 1970s. It was so successful in his precinct, he was promoted within the Boston department to expand the program citywide. It never happened though, because Boston ended up laying off officers before Bratton's plan could be implemented. Bratton also said there is a similar program used in the Los Angeles Police Department, which he led for seven years in the 2000s. \"For years we've been asking our officers to engage in the community, but we've never given them time to do it, or the training,\" Bratton said.\n\nUnder the new plan, officers will be able to more easily follow up on past crimes, meet with community members, and build relationships with local residents. \"Cops will know their sectors and the citizens will know them. They'll know the problem areas and the problem people. I truly believe when cops embrace their neighborhoods, their neighborhoods will embrace them back,\" Bratton said.\n\nIf residents in those same neighborhoods take to the streets in civic protest, perhaps they'd be better policed by those same officers rather than heavily armed strangers."

      "text": "NYPD Commissioner Says Snubbing Mayor de Blasio Was 'Inappropriate'\n\nBill Bratton insists that police officers should not have turned their backs en masse as the mayor spoke at a funeral on Saturday-but he acknowledged that morale is low throughout the department.\n\nA day after hundreds of NYPD officers, in an act of defiance, turned their back on New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio as he spoke at a funeral for Officer Rafael Ramos, who was killed along with Officer Wenjian Liu earlier this month, New York City Police Commissioner defended the mayor and said the officers' act was \"very inappropriate.\"\n\n\"That funeral was held to honor Officer Ramos, and to bring politics, to bring issues into that event, I think was very inappropriate and I do not support it,\" said Commissioner Bill Bratton on CBS' Face The Nation . \"He is the mayor of New York. He was there representing the citizens of New York to express their remorse and their regret at that death.\n\n\"At the same time,\" he added, \"it is reflective unfortunately of the feelings of some of our officers at this juncture-about not just the mayor but, I think, about some of the many issues that are afflicting the city at this time.\" He admitted that \"morale in the department at this time is low, there's no getting around that,\" noting contract negotiations with the city as well as national dialogues about relations between police and communities of color.\n\nHowever, Bratton defended de Blasio: \"This is a mayor that cares very deeply about New York City police officers, cares very deeply about the divide in this city at this time and is working very hard to heal that divide.\"\n\nThe relationship between de Blasio and some of the city's police officers grew tense after comments de Blasio made in the wake of grand jury decisions not to indict police officers who had killed Michael Brown and Eric Garner. De Blasio said he and his wife had found it necessary \"to literally train\" their son Dante how to handle encounters with police.\n\n\"What parents have done for decades, who have children of color, especially young men of color, is train them to be very careful when they have a connection with a police officer,\" de Blasio said at the time, prompting the head of the largest New York police union to say the mayor \"threw cops under the bus.\"\n\nIn a separate interview on Face the Nation , former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, one of the most vocal critics of de Blasio's views on race and his relations with the police, agreed with Bratton that it was disrespectful for police officers to turn their backs on de Blasio.\n\n\"The mayor is not in any way to be treated with people turning their backs,\" said Giuliani. \"Doesn't matter if you like the mayor or you don't like the mayor; you have to respect the mayor's position.\"\n\nHowever, Giuliani by stood by earlier remarks that the mayor had used anti-police rhetoric and should apologize for appearing to side with protesters over the NYPD.\n\n\"He created an impression with the police that he was on the side of the protesters,\" the former mayor said. \"Now, some of those protesters were entirely legitimate, but some of those protesters were horrible, yelling, 'Kill the police, kill the police, kill the police!'\"\n\nGiuliani also reiterated his criticism of President Barack Obama's statements on police issues and his relationship with Reverend Al Sharpton.\n\n\"If he would like to have a poster boy for hating the police, it's Al Sharpton,\" said Giuliani. \"You make Al Sharpton a close adviser, you're going to turn the police and America against you. You're going to tell the police in America, 'We don't understand you.' I saw this man help cause riots in New York. I've heard his anti-police invective first-hand.\""

      "text": "I Was a Police Officer for 20 Years. I Know What It Means to Put More Guns on the Street.\n\nHow the Supreme Court made cities less safe\n\nPolice officers have a vested interest in keeping illegal guns off the streets, a difficult-enough task already. Now the United States Supreme Court decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association Inc. v. Bruen has found unconstitutional the New York law that strictly limited who could carry a firearm in public in the nation's largest metropolis. At one blow, this ruling ends a restriction that has for decades helped hold down the number of guns in private hands in New York City. The Court's decision has made the job of the New York Police Department much harder overnight.\n\nOfficers never know what will happen next. On patrol they may walk into a deli and be confronted with an armed robbery. They may conduct a routine car stop only to find themselves faced with a violent felon willing to murder a cop.\n\nToday I'm a professor of criminal justice, but I spent more than 20 years in the NYPD; I retired with the rank of captain. Gun crime was fairly common in the 1980s and '90s but we had reasonable laws to enforce that helped us control the prevalence of illegal guns. Working a midnight shift one night, my partner was driving us in a marked car back to the precinct house when I saw a man threatening a group of people outside a bar. He had a gun in his hand.\n\nMy partner pulled over quickly. The moment I got out, I was facing the man from a distance of about eight feet, with no cover whatsoever. The crowd of people shrank back in anticipation of a violent confrontation. I had unholstered my gun and was ready to shoot. Had I done so, it would have been a clear-cut situation that entitled me to use deadly force. But I did not pull the trigger.\n\nDavid Frum: America's gun plague\n\nPart of it was being aware of the crowd behind the man and the risk of an innocent bystander getting shot, but part of it was simply an instinct about how to handle the situation. I walked up to the man, forced the gun from his hand, and placed him under arrest.\n\nThis all happened in seconds, so quickly that I, like most officers, had reacted simply on the basis of my experience and training. We were trained, of course, to handle any kind of gun encounter that might arise, but they were rare. Today's Supreme Court decision threatens that rarity.\n\nLaw-enforcement training is focused on saving lives. Gun violence in the United States is an all-too-real fixture. News media are filled with stories of rising crime, shootings, and murders . By the very nature of their job, police officers are on the front line: In 2021 and to date, 92 officers in the U.S. have been killed by guns.\n\nCompared with other Western democracies, American culture is more violent and more affected by illegal drugs. Indeed, the U.S. is the world's largest consumer of illicit drugs, accounting for an estimated quarter of global demand. In police parlance, where there are drugs, there are guns. The U.S. has an unparalleled density of gun ownership: more than 120 guns for every 100 residents, which is more than double the rate of the country with the next-highest ranking , Yemen, a nation that has been racked by civil war for years. In America, 79 percent of homicides are committed with a gun; the equivalent figure in the United Kingdom is 4 percent.\n\nPolice understand that American citizens have constitutional liberties, including Second Amendment rights; police are there to protect both people and the Constitution. But what makes sense in upstate rural areas is not necessarily good policy for densely populated metropolitan areas with busy plazas and packed subways. One reasonable limitation on gun ownership would be proper licensing: We require licensing for most professionals-including teachers, lawyers, nurses, lifeguards, doctors, police officers, electricians, and others-yet not to hold and use a firearm?\n\nCommon sense also dictates that owning a gun requires some level of safety training and care. We expect our police officers to have this competence with the sidearms they carry, so why wouldn't we ask the same of anyone who wants to carry a gun in public? Someone who wants to purchase a weapon should have to demonstrate a basic level of expertise and safety awareness.\n\nSuicide is another concern. More than half of suicides in the United States involve a gun, and more than half of gun deaths are suicides. The availability of a gun greatly increases the risk of suicide. The tragic fact is that I know more police officers who have taken their own lives with their service weapon than those who have been killed in the line of duty.\n\nI do not argue for preventing law-abiding citizens from owning guns, but let's start with strong background checks for all purchases, including those made through the internet, trade shows, and private sales-and let's eliminate the loopholes. Insurance should be required by federal law as well. If someone uses a gun and causes harm, that needs to be covered by insurance-just as car owners must have insurance. This measure would also protect the gun owner from liability in case something goes wrong, such as an accidental discharge.\n\nDavid A. Graham: The subway-crime death spiral\n\nEven before the Supreme Court decision, the NYPD had to deal with illegal firearms-most of them contraband from states with lax gun-control regimes. The city has seen a spate of shootings recently, an aspect of rising violent crime that Mayor Eric Adams has made a priority to tackle. But the policing initiatives he touted earlier this year as an effective way of getting illegal guns out of our communities will be hampered by this change to the law.\n\nThe answer to rising violent crime is better policing, not more people arming themselves. Those who worked to end the New York law should ask themselves whether they really want to live in an America where public safety comes down to armed self-defense and vigilantism rather than reassuring, effective police work.\n\nLaw enforcement needs a supportive public. Reasonable gun control is not optional but absolutely necessary to protect citizens and to allow police to do their job. Today, a crucial law that made public-safety sense in a huge, dense, busy city has been nullified. I worry that this ruling will force cops to act with greater caution and suspicion, and work in more defensive ways that will harm community relations. I worry that the streets of New York just got less safe."

      "text": "Police Reform Needs to Come From Within\n\nPeople are rightly worried about rising crime. We know how to tackle that problem, and it's not by defunding.\n\nNo one wants authoritarian law-enforcement agencies that violate civil rights or oppress minority communities. Neither does anyone want high rates of crime, especially violent crime . Those who advocate police reform need to accept both truths, because if people feel the streets are unsafe, then the reforms-regardless of their merits-become right-wing talking points. A criminal-justice system that fails to check rising crime will, as we've seen, face a backlash.\n\nSo what's a police reformer to do? Some may wonder at my weighing in on this. In certain circles, I am regarded as the worst kind of police authoritarian, largely because I was New York Police Commissioner under Mayor Rudy Giuliani in the 1990s and I supported the strategy of \" broken windows \" policing. But in my experience, lasting police reform comes from within. Cops understand better than anyone that when you set out to remake a police agency, you don't want to undercut what it does well in an effort to correct what it does poorly.\n\nSmart reform starts with winning trust from two different groups. First: neighborhoods. You want to serve local communities, respond to their requests for police action, and maintain civil order, but you don't want to over-police and foster a sense of officers as an occupying army. At the NYPD, starting in 2014, I and my deputies sent a clear message to the rank and file to use intelligent discretion. We were looking for quality of arrests, not quantity. My successors continued this strategy. As a result, the enforcement footprint shrank-especially in the city's communities of color. Arrests of Black and Hispanic New Yorkers fell by nearly 195,000 from 2013 to 2021, according to data from the NYPD. Meanwhile, most types of crime in the city continued on the downward trend that began in mid-1990s--until the surge that started in the pandemic spring of 2020.\n\nSecond: the cops. Since I first became a police officer, in Boston in 1970, I've been aware that cops tend to cocoon themselves, becoming isolated from the communities they serve. I have seen how a low work ethic and a curdled cynicism can become entrenched in a department. That's dangerous. A complacent, unproductive department is one in which abusive and violent individual officers can thrive.\n\nDavid A. Graham: The subway-crime death spiral\n\nSo, yes, hammer police abuse of force. Hammer police misconduct. But don't hammer police departments and their personnel in general. Indiscriminate rhetorical attacks on police as violent and racist have a withering effect on morale. When the chorus of criticism grows too intense, you will see officers falling into lassitude, neglecting the mission, walking away from the profession. This is a path to neither successful law enforcement nor good relations between police and neighborhoods.\n\nViolent crime is on the rise across the country, so what can be done about it? The answer lies in the sort of policing that has served New York, and other cities, well in the past but that we lost sight of amid the turmoil of the past few years. The essence of the approach is well-managed, motivated police departments that target criminal behavior in problem locations in order to provide the public safety that communities themselves rightly demand.\n\nThe data show that most street criminals-especially those responsible for robbery, burglary, larceny, and auto theft-are repeat offenders. In the mid-'90s, when we instituted the CompStat system in New York City, we started doing a much better job of identifying and apprehending these career offenders. The effect on crime rates in the ensuing decades was extraordinary.\n\nCompStat broke down the silos in the NYPD that had beat patrols, the narcotics division, and the Detective Bureau operating separately and without coordination. Still in use by the NYPD, the system relies on mapping and other tracking technologies to gather accurate, real-time intelligence on street crime. Police can see which tactics prove effective in one precinct and then export them to others. Perhaps most important, CompStat makes it possible to see exactly how the department is performing, citywide, from day to day.\n\nPrecision policing, as the CompStat-enabled approach is known, works by targeting a specific small, recidivist criminal population. To some, the very idea of a criminal population is controversial, even reprehensible. They argue for treating each arrestee as a perpetual first offender, regardless of prior offenses, and they oppose placing chronic reoffenders in pretrial custody to protect the public. Across the country, progressive district attorneys have been declining to prosecute lesser offenses, including theft and misdemeanor assaults, and downgrading charges and possible sentences for many felony crimes.\n\nShadi Hamid: The liberals who won't acknowledge the crime problem\n\nThe progressives secured a big victory in New York State's sweeping 2019 bail reforms, which abolished bail conditions for many crimes without giving state judges the discretion to impose custody in particular cases. Noble in spirit perhaps, these measures reduced the deterrent effect of arrests, because offenders know they will face no immediate consequences if apprehended. Of the nearly 100,000 people charged but released pretrial in 2020 under New York's reformed policy, about one-fifth were rearrested while their first case was pending. And last year, according to the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services, more than 90 percent of the 60,000 felony arrests resulted in no jail or prison time, or even probation; a scant 3 percent of arrests ended in prison sentences-compared with 8 percent in 2017, and 7 percent in 2018 and 2019.\n\nThis is not a blow against mass incarceration; it's a blow against controlling felony crime. New York's recent move to undo the damage of this failing policy-by partially restoring judges' ability to impose bail for some crimes and by allowing bail to be set for those rearrested while a prior case is pending-is welcome but insufficient. Real reform is about leading and inspiring police organizations to fulfill both their crime control and their service missions. We need good police leaders to instill in young cops a sense of responsibility and service, and we need them to be willing to discipline those who go astray. But we must also ensure they have the tools they need to do the job.\n\nCritics like to portray such policing technologies as DNA databases , photo-recognition software , automatic license-plate readers , and, in New York City, the gang database as instruments of Orwellian government surveillance. They are nothing of the kind: DNA, photo recognition, and license-plate readers are all more reliable identification tools than the traditional reliance on eyewitnesses (DNA, in particular, has exonerated many innocent people). The gang database, which allows police to track the membership of some 500 violent criminal organizations , is a reasonable response to the fact that in 2019, for example, gang-related shootings accounted for nearly half of shootings in the city.\n\nAside from gang activity, shootings in New York have always correlated closely with disorderly streets. Back in 1990, a historic high-water mark of crime in the city, there were about 5,200 shootings , or about 100 every week. This was none too surprising given that, when I joined the department in 1994, some 5,000 to 6,000 locations identified by the NYPD were plagued by open-air drug dealing or by disorderly conduct such as street prostitution, aggressive begging, squeegee nuisance, and illegal peddling. From that time, the NYPD was able to use CompStat to track and map shootings in the city; within a few years, we had also largely cleared the open-air drug markets and problems associated with them. By reasserting police authority in these hot spots, we cut shootings to approximately 1,700 by 1998, and to fewer than 800 by 2018. The rise in gun deaths and murders since 2020 has many causes, but a contributory factor has been that the department had, under political pressure, either abandoned or trimmed the units responsible for homeless outreach and for enforcement against street narcotics, prostitution, peddling, and fare evasion.\n\nRead: First comes police reform. Then comes everything else.\n\nThe only reform that makes sense, because of this connection between disorderly streets and violent crime, is one that aims to control broken-windows offenses. Some have caricatured this approach as state repression of minority communities. In fact, those local residents are most often the most vocal in support of tackling minor offenses that directly affect their neighborhood's quality of life. Others will also say that a renewed focus on broken-windows policing will result in the sort of abuse we saw with the stop-and-frisk tactic in New York.\n\nUnquestionably overused until about a decade ago, stop-and-frisk arguably amounted to harassment in neighborhoods where many Black and brown people lived. But in contrast to stop-and-frisk, for which officers require only reasonable suspicion to make a stop, broken-windows arrests and summonses require the much higher standard of probable cause. When residents report quality-of-life offenses to the 911 or 311 services, they expect action. If police departments want to serve their communities, they must do this kind of policing.\n\nMany today have come to view the relatively low crime rates of recent decades almost as an American birthright. Police professionals, by contrast, see it neither as a fixed condition nor as a permanent accomplishment. We view crime as a day-to-day challenge, a problem that must be managed, suppressed, and controlled by law-enforcement agencies in order to achieve those low rates. We can reverse the current crime trends, because we know what's worked before-but we won't succeed by defunding the police."

City of New York and Handschu v. Special Services Division . Both agreements are subject to court approval.\n\nThe Raza suit charged the NYPD of violating the Constitution by singling out New Yorkers based on their religion. The case sought systemic reforms to prevent law enforcement abuses. In Handschu, lawyers argued the investigations of Muslims violated the long-standing consent decree in that case. The New York Times has the background on Handschu :\n\nThe intelligence unit began in the 1900s as the Italian Squad, with a focus on suspected anarchists.

The lawsuit has remained active for decades , serving as a check against police overreaching.\n\n\"We are committed to strengthening the relationship between our administration and communities of faith so that residents of every background feel respected and protected,\" Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement . \"New York City's Muslim residents are strong partners in the fight against terrorism, and this settlement represents another important step toward building our relationship with the Muslim community.\"\n\nWilliam Bratton, the city's police commissioner, called the agreement a step toward building and maintaining  trust with the city's Muslim community.\n\nBratton, in the statement, said: \"Incorporating existing NYPD practices into the Handschu Guidelines makes it easier to maintain best practices in intelligence gathering and investigations.\"\n\nThe modifications bring the guidelines closer in line with the practices of the FBI.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, which brought one of the cases on behalf of Imam Hamid Hassan Raza, in a statement said : \"This agreement with the country's largest police force sends a forceful message that bias-based policing is unlawful, harmful, and unnecessary.\"\n\nAmong other things, the agreement prohibits investigations in which race, religion, or ethnicity is a substantial or motivating factor; requires factual information about possible unlawful activity before a preliminary investigation into political or religious activity; and ends open-ended investigations.\n\nIt also introduces a civilian to monitor police surveillance of religious groups. The ACLU adds:\n\nInstalling a civilian representative within the NYPD with the power and obligation to ensure all safeguards are followed and to serve as a check on investigations directed at political and religious activities. The civilian representative must record and report any violations to the police commissioner, who must investigate violations and report back to the civilian representative. If violations are systematic, the civilian representative must report them directly to the judge in the Handschu case.\n\nYou can read the agreement here ."

We are joined by three people who were at the Mott Haven protest: Samira and Amali Sierra, sisters who are two of the five listed plaintiffs, and Democracy Now! video news fellow Sonyi Lopez, whose footage of the protest was used in a Human Rights Watch report that condemned the NYPD's actions as \"serious violations of international human rights law.\" In addition, we speak to Joshua Moskovitz, one of the lawyers representing the plaintiffs.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nWe begin today's show here in New York, where the city has agreed to a multimillion-dollar settlement with peaceful protesters who were violently \"boxed in\" or \"kettled\" by New York police officers during a Black Lives Matter demonstration two weeks after the police murder of George Floyd in 2020. As part of the settlement, over 300 people who were trapped by police and assaulted with batons and pepper spray, then detained or arrested at a June 4th, 2020, protest, will each receive $21,500 - believed to be the largest class-action settlement in a case of mass arrest. The arrests took place in the South Bronx. A Human Rights Watch investigation said the NYPD's conduct that day amounted to \"serious violations of international human rights law.\"\n\nPROTESTER 1: We are currently trapped at 136th and Brook Avenue, since 7:45. They are pushing us!\n\nPROTESTER 2: Oh my god! Oh!\n\nPROTESTER 1: They are pushing us!\n\nPROTESTER 2: They're pushing us!\n\nPROTESTER 1: They are pushing us!\n\nPROTESTER 2: They're pushing us!\n\nPROTESTER 1: They are pushing us! They are pushing us! Stay calm! Stay calm! Stay calm! What are you doing?\n\nPOLICE OFFICER : Move! Move! Move! Move!\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That's part of a video report produced by Human Rights Watch that raised awareness about the kettling that took place that day. This is another clip.\n\nIDA SAWYER : As the marchers headed down Willis Avenue, more than 50 police officers blocked the street.\n\nPROTESTER 1: Yo, we gonna go around. We gonna go around.\n\nIDA SAWYER : The march redirected down 136th Street. And in the final minutes just before the 8:00 curfew, instead of allowing or even directing the marchers to disperse, the NYPD diverted its bicycle officers to block the marchers just as they reached the intersection of 136th and Brook Avenue.\n\nPROTESTER 2: What did I do?\n\nPROTESTER 3: Why are you pushing, bro?\n\nPOLICE OFFICER : Mobile fence line one! Move the crowd!\n\nPOLICE OFFICERS : Move back! Move back!\n\nPROTESTER 4: Go that way! Go that way! Go that way!\n\nPROTESTERS : Let us through! Let us through! Let us through! Let us through!\n\nIDA SAWYER : And from behind the march, a line of officers blocked the protesters from turning back. It's a tactic called kettling.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That's from a Human Rights Watch investigation of the NYPD kettling in the South Bronx June 4th, 2020, that was the focus of the historic settlement announced this week. In response to concerns raised at the time, the police said their crackdown was preplanned. This is New York City Police Commissioner, at the time, Dermot Shea.\n\nCOMMISSIONER DERMOT SHEA : And we had a plan which was executed nearly flawlessly in the Bronx. This wasn't, again, about protest; this was about tearing down society.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Meanwhile, NYPD's Strategic Response Group has continued to target nonviolent protesters, and this week dozens of people testified at the New York City Council about their abusive tactics. The NYPD refused to show up.\n\nFor more, we're joined by three people who were at the protest in the Bronx in June 2020. Sonyi Lopez was filming the protest. She's currently a video news fellow here at Democracy Now! Her footage was used in the Human Rights Watch report. Also with us, Samira Sierra and Amali Sierra. They're sisters. They're among the five listed plaintiffs. And joining us, Joshua Moskovitz, one of the lawyers representing the plaintiffs.\n\nWe welcome you all to Democracy Now! Let's begin with the plaintiffs, with Samira and Amali. Samira, why don't you start off by talking about what this protest was about, two weeks after George Floyd's murder, where you marched and what happened?\n\nSAMIRA SIERRA : Good morning.\n\nThe protest was during the uprisings right after George Floyd's murder. And simply, we were exercising our human rights, our civil rights, and we were demonstrating and standing up against all of the racial injustice that happens day in and day out in this country.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And, Amali, that's your older sister Samira. Talk about your decision. I mean, it was brave to go out. We're talking about June of 2020. This is at the height of the COVID pandemic, at the time of the killing, the police killing of George Floyd. Did you expect what happened to happen? And then explain what happened in just one block of the South Bronx, when you were stopped by police.\n\nAMALI SIERRA : Yes, so, to your point, this was in the midst of a global health crisis. We had been in the pandemic for a few months at this point. This was not the first of the protests that we attended that summer. It was the first that we had attended in our home, in the South Bronx. And the energy that day, from the beginning of the protest, was very tense. And so, the very short protest that we partook in on June 4th reflected just that. It was very tense. It was met very violently. However, we were very peaceful in our demeanor, while also making sure to exercise our right, that we are entitled to, and express the anger and the frustration that we felt because of the violence that Black and Brown people are constantly met with in the United States of America. And so, although our message was very clear and we were very intentional in expressing our frustration and our anger, we were - at any time, we were not violent. We were very peaceful. And so, it was met very violently, and we were not expecting at any point to be met with all the aggression that we were by the NYPD and by the SRG specifically.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I mean, the terrifying image, Samira, of the police blocking you in, kettling you, and telling you to move where there's no place to go. And then explain what the police did.\n\nSAMIRA SIERRA : Sure. So, we were very strategically guided down 136th Street. And when we - as we were walking down towards Brook Avenue, we were blocked off by a line of officers on both ends of the street, so off of Willis Avenue and on Brook Avenue. And there was a commander in a white shirt who continued to direct the officers to move in at the same time. We were boxed in. We were kettled. And we were also, like, squished. Our bodies were squished, like squished up against each other. There were people that - I mean, you just passed that footage where, you know, it was terror. We were terrified for our lives. People couldn't breathe. People were fainting. I have never in my life felt the amount of fear that I felt that day.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Sonyi Lopez, it's great to have you on screen, as you're usually behind the scenes and filming - and that's what you were doing that day - a Democracy Now! video news fellow now. But at the time, you were filming this protest. Explain what you saw. And, I mean, when you see the police, the first arrests are of the legal and the medics? And they're very clear about what they're doing. \"Move ahead and arrest them,\" they said.\n\nSONYI LOPEZ : Right, Amy. I was there. I'm actually a South Bronx resident. I live in Mott Haven. And this was the second peaceful protest that I participated in in my neighborhood. And it was absolutely peaceful. What I saw when the police came down this hill on 137th Street and kettled folks, I saw police coming down the hill on bikes at rapid speed. And as soon as that happened, literally like a second later, they started blocking people off with their bikes and pushing people with these bikes, attacking medics, like you said, Amy, attacking lawyers, people that were there, legal aids, to help community members and protesters alike in case things like this happen, right? But we were not expecting that.\n\nLuckily, I managed to run away, but before I could run away, I was able to document and film. As you said, HRW and SITU - Human Rights Watch - were able to use the video that I recorded that day. But it was frightening. I had never been so scared in my - and fearful in my own neighborhood. And I'll never forget that. I wasn't able to leave my home for months after that, like other protesters, and felt unsafe. And it was just so traumatizing that day.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to bring the lawyer into this conversation, Joshua Moskovitz, the lawyer for the plaintiffs. Joshua, talk about the unit of police. I mean, we just played Dermot Shea, the police chief at the time in New York, saying this was all preplanned by the police. And in this Human Rights Watch reporting, which uses a lot of Sonyi's footage, you see they deliberately go after the legal and the medical teams first. And they're very clear. One of the police officers said, \"It's fine\" - it said something - I think he had \"police legal\" on his shirt, and he said, \"It's fine to arrest the legal observers,\" who were considered essential workers at the time, right? They were allowed to be out. Explain who this team of police are.\n\nJOSHUA MOSKOVITZ : Right. So, the NYPD's Strategic Response Group, or SRG , are a paramilitary organization within the NYPD that are used to police protest events, nonviolent protest events like we saw in Mott Haven. They've come under appropriate scrutiny for their violent tactics that are primarily used to suppress nonviolent free speech activity like we saw in Mott Haven.\n\nThis was no accident. This was a planned operation. And what's unique about the Mott Haven operation is that it was planned by the highest-level officials within the police department. Terence Monahan, the chief of department, which is the highest-ranked - highest uniformed ranking officer within the police department, was personally present at Mott Haven. So were the executive officer, the commanding officer and the bureau chief that oversee the SRG unit. They had a plan that day, and, as the commissioner said the next day, it was executed, in their view, flawlessly.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I mean, it's just astounding. And you see them separate out one of the leaders of the protest with a bullhorn. They push her aside. In fact, she was one of the first to be arrested.\n\nJOSHUA MOSKOVITZ : That's right. I mean, there is no question in the world that the plan that day was to instill fear in people so that they would stop protesting. This was not a violent uprising. This was a peaceful protest. In fact, there were people attending the protest who lived in the South Bronx who were members of the mayor's Cabinet. The commissioner of the community affairs for Mayor de Blasio was there personally, because he lived in the South Bronx, Marco Carrión. He talked about what happened that day and described the sentiment at the protest as closer to a candlelight vigil. The purpose of this operation was to instill fear in people.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You know, it's very interesting that on Wednesday the City Council held a long-planned, repeatedly delayed oversight hearing on the Strategic Response Group, that was involved with this. No one from the NYPD showed up, citing ongoing litigation. Your response to this? And talk about this historic settlement, in the country, for what took place in the South Bronx.\n\nJOSHUA MOSKOVITZ : Well, as you said, this is a historic settlement. As far as we can tell, this is the largest per person class-action mass arrest settlement in the country. And we think that that is appropriate, given the extreme violence that we saw carried out by the NYPD during the operation. And the size of the award that the city agreed to, we think, reflects an acknowledgment or understanding that what happened that day was unconstitutional, it was immoral, and it should never happen again. We hope that the NYPD has taken this to heart and will reform the operations and, frankly, never use the SRG for policing protest events in the future.\n\nBut the other aspect of this case that I think often gets overlooked is that this happened in the South Bronx. This happened in New York Congressional District 15, which is 97% people of color. It's also one of the poorest congressional districts in the entire country. This operation wasn't carried out in Manhattan, where there were protests. It wasn't carried out in Brooklyn, where there were protests that summer. There was a choice made at the highest levels of the NYPD to carry out this operation in the South Bronx. And that fact is part of what has led to the Human Rights Watch finding this to be a human rights violation. And we're proud of our clients in pursuing this litigation and pursuing the result that they achieved here for people who weren't able to get lawyers but were there that day and who were injured.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Amali and Samira - Amali, you're 25. Samira is 30 now. This was three years ago. What does this settlement mean for each of you? Amali, let's begin with you.\n\nAMALI SIERRA : This settlement is larger than myself. I believe that the settlement allows for individuals who were there that day, the hundreds of individuals that were there that day, the opportunity to come forward, the opportunity to be recognized and acknowledged, based off of the abuse that they endured that day, and hopefully an opportunity to also heal. It was very traumatic, and trauma looks very different for every individual. And so, I hope that this encourages all of the individuals that were unable to represent themselves to come forward. And that is why it is extremely crucial and very important to be a representative of a class action of this magnitude, not just for myself but for the greater good and for all of the people that were unable to represent themselves.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And, Samira, your response? And also the fact that no police officer was charged that day, and also there wasn't an official apology, but you did have this financial settlement.\n\nSAMIRA SIERRA : Right. The settlement, to me, means that the City of New York is being held accountable for organizing the highest level of the NYPD , which is the Strategic Response Group, and holding them accountable for flawlessly executing excessive force in the South Bronx, which is my home.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Josh, very quickly -\n\nSAMIRA SIERRA : It also means to -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Oh, go ahead.\n\nSAMIRA SIERRA : It also means to me that, you know, they're being held accountable for the violation of human rights of Black and Brown folks in this country, one of many. We have a long way to go, but it feels really good, for the lack of a better word, to know that there is some accountability.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Joshua, very quickly, there are other lawsuits, right? This is not the only one, this class action.\n\nJOSHUA MOSKOVITZ : That's right. There are other lawsuits that are still proceeding, one, in fact, interestingly, brought by New York State Attorney General's Office against the City of New York seeking injunctive relief to reform the police department's policing of protest events.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And finally, Sonyi Lopez, you were not kettled in. You escaped that. But can you talk about the effect on you, as a journalist who was filming, seeing these people kettled in, being beaten by the police?\n\nSONYI LOPEZ : Absolutely, Amy. Me, beyond being a journalist, I'm a community member. I grew up in this area, so it hurt to see my community being beat like this. And, you know, in response to the class-action lawsuit, it's great that people are getting monetary - you know, being compensated monetarily, but we also need some trauma - some healing, maybe therapy offered to folks like myself who ran away, who were able to get away from this.\n\nI also wanted to add, really quickly, Amy, that Mott Haven Families, a community group with children and adults, protested in front of the 40th Precinct demanding accountability and asking the question, \"What happened on June 4th?\" for months on end, and had no response, no answer from the NYPD or accountability from the city. And meanwhile, a small jail - a jail was being built in Mott Haven across the street from my former middle school while all of this was happening. So, this is just a traumatic event, and I think that we need to remember that people are still healing from this to this day.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, Sonyi Lopez, I want to thank you for joining us on screen today, Democracy Now! video news fellow, filmed the protest in 2020; Samira and Amali Sierra, named plaintiffs in this historic class-action lawsuit; and Joshua Moskovitz, lawyer for the plaintiffs.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

But Trump could challenge the ruling.\n\nThe New York Times also confirmed the department's intentions.\n\nAccording to the newspaper, Trump had a concealed carry permit in New York with three registered pistols.

The third gun was previously transferred legally to Florida.\n\nFederal and state law in both states dictate that convicted felons cannot possess a firearm, according to the Times.\n\nHuffPost previously reported that Trump, as a person convicted of crimes, could face up to a year in prison for owning or buying firearms, according to the Gun Control Act of 1968.\n\nTrump's recent conviction for concealing hush-money payments to a porn star before the 2016 election carries a sentence that could be years behind bars, but that is not likely.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "We Are All Muslims: A Sikh Response to Islamophobia in the NYPD and Beyond\n\nsocial justice educator & musician\n\nAs a brown-skinned Sikh with a turban on my head and a long beard on my chin, I deal with my fair share of racist and xenophobic harassment regularly, including in my home of New York City, the most diverse city on the planet. It usually takes the form of someone yelling or perhaps mumbling at me: Osama bin Laden/terrorist/al Qaeda/he's going to blow up the [insert location]/go back to your country/etc. Less often, someone might threaten me, get in my face, or in one case, pull off my turban on the subway.\n\nMy experience is not terribly unique for a turban-wearing Sikh in the United States. Especially since 9/11, we Sikhs have become all too familiar with racial epithets, bullying and violence. Just last month, a gurdwara in Michigan was vandalized with hostile anti-Muslim graffiti. Last year, in what we can assume was a hate attack, two elderly Sikh men were shot and killed while taking an evening walk in a quiet neighborhood in Elk Grove, Calif.\n\nMany talk about the prevalence of anti-Sikh attacks as a case of \"mistaken identity.\" Sikhs mistaken for Muslims. Indeed, we are by and large attacked because of anti-Muslim bigotry. The Michigan gurdwara was targeted for that reason, and most of us who experience racist harassment as Sikhs in the U.S. experience it through the vilification of Muslims and/or Arabs.\n\nIronically, many Sikhs themselves vilify Muslims or at least distance themselves from the Muslim community at every possible opportunity. I remember in the days, weeks and months after 9/11, the first thing out of the mouths of many Sikhs when talking to the press, to politicians or even to their neighbors was, \"We are not Muslims.\" While this is of course a fact, the implication of the statement if it stops there is: You're attacking the wrong community. Don't come after us, go after the Muslims! Sikhs believe in equality and freedom and love our country and our government. But Muslims? We don't like them either.\n\nThe roots of anti-Muslim sentiment in the Sikh community run deep in South Asia, from the days of the tyranny of Mughal emperors such as Aurangzeb in the 17th century to the bloodshed in 1947 when our homeland of Punjab was sliced into two separate nation-states. Despite these historical realities, Sikhism has always been clear that neither Muslims as a people nor Islam as a religion were ever the enemy. Tyranny was the enemy. Oppression was the enemy. Sectarianism was the enemy. In fact, the Guru Granth Sahib, our scriptures that are the center of Sikh philosophy and devotion, contains the writings of Muslim (Sufi) saints alongside those of our own Sikh Gurus. Nevertheless, historical memory breeds misguided hostility and mistrust of Muslims, especially in the contemporary global context of ever-increasing, mainstream Islamophobia.\n\nWhat is it going to take for Sikhs and Muslims to join together in solidarity against the common enemies of racist harassment and violence, racial and religious profiling, and Islamophobic bigotry? Perhaps the recently exposed NYPD spying program (along with the \" education \" officers have received about Islam) will serve as a wake up call to my community (and other communities for that matter) about how bad things have really gotten. While we Sikhs confront bigotry on a daily basis from our neighbors, classmates, co-workers, employers and strangers on the street, our Muslim American counterparts are systematically targeted by our own government. (I should note that, of course, Sikhs too are profiled by law enforcement in less repressive, though still troubling, ways, especially at airport security ).\n\nSikhism was born hundreds of years ago in part to stand up for the most oppressed and fight for the freedom and liberation of all people. If this isn't reason enough for us to make the cause of rooting out Islamophobia from the NYPD and other law enforcement and government agencies our own, we only have to return to the bleak reality we Sikhs in the U.S. still face right now in 2012. A time when gurdwaras are still vandalized with anti-Muslim statements, Sikh kids are still being bullied and tormented at school every day, and I am called Osama bin Laden while walking down a Manhattan street for the 258th time (no I'm not counting).\n\n\"We are not Muslims\" hasn't been so effective for our community, has it? Even if we do so in a positive way that does not condone attacks on Muslims, simply educating the public about the fact that we are a distinct community and that we in fact \"are not Muslim\" will not get to the root of the problem. As long as we live in a country (and world) where an entire community (in this case, Muslims) is targeted, spied on and vilified, we will not be safe, we will not be free.\n\nAs Martin Luther King, Jr. wrote in his letter from a Birmingham jail in 1963, \"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny.\"\n\nI hope the NYPD's blatant assault on the civil rights of our Muslim sisters and brothers propels us Sikhs as well as all people of conscience to action. Perhaps \"We are not Muslims\" will become \"We are all Muslims,\" as we come together to eradicate Islamophobic bigotry in all its forms.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "The NYPD May Be Secretly Using Facebook Photos In Its Facial Recognition Searches\n\nFreelance journalist\n\nThe New York City Police Department's facial recognition program has courted controversy from the moment it was created in 2011 - civil libertarians and residents of the city didn't want the largest police department in the country to become an all-seeing panopticon. But the NYPD has always insisted suspect photos are only checked against mugshots, not images from other government agencies, like the Department of Motor vehicles, not images from the traffic cameras or against security footage, and certainly not pictures from social media.\n\nIn two recent cases, however, official documents from the NYPD Facial Information Section (FIS) obtained by HuffPost indicate that social media photos were used to generate a match for a suspect who was later arrested and charged.\n\nIf the department is indeed placing social media images into its facial recognition database, New Yorkers who post photos on Facebook or Instagram might be at risk of becoming suspects in a criminal investigation, since the NYPD uses facial recognition hits as starting points for criminal probes. Given the well-known inaccuracy of facial recognition software, both the innocent and the guilty could be swept into the department's digital dragnet.\n\nIn one FIS document obtained by HuffPost for a 2016 assault where a juvenile was charged, the \"search results section\" has a box for \"source of image\" - and it says \"social media.\" In another field on the form for \"social media,\" an investigator who filled it out noted \"(FB)\" - which further suggests the source of the photo used to generate a match in this case was Facebook. Jerome Greco, the defendant's public defender from the Legal Aid Society, said that the documents were turned over during the normal course of discovery.\n\nGreco, who specializes in digital forensics investigation at Legal Aid, said that typically the facial recognition unit forms included the term \"photomanager\" in the source of image field, to indicate that it came from the NYPD's mugshot database.\n\nThe photo attached to the search results was a selfie of a person with a hoodie up who is leaning on a couch, according to Greco. \"We believe that this was taken from a social media profile,\" he said.\n\nA similar situation occurred recently in the Bronx . Sidney Thaxter, a Bronx Defenders attorney and digital forensics specialist, was defending a client charged with robbery. Thaxter said the Bronx district attorney's office turned over a package of discovery from the NYPD that included the same FIS search results report: \"SOCIAL MEDIA/FACEBOOK\" was listed as the source of image under the search results.\n\nIt's not clear how the social media images would be making their way into the facial recognition database, though it wouldn't be the first time that unauthorized pictures turned up in the FIS system. In August 2019, I reported in Medium's OneZero that in another one of Bronx Defenders' cases a sealed mugshot was discovered in the facial recognition database - a clear violation of a New York state law which dictates that sealed photos be destroyed or returned to the subject.\n\nThese documents appear to be straightforward proof the NYPD is inputting social media images into its facial recognition database - though the department denies it. \"The limited information that is visible on these forms indicates that FIS did not utilize facial recognition technology to identify the suspects in these cases. Instead, they were able to determine the identity of the suspect using information that was available in publicly accessible social media accounts,\" said Devora Kaye, an NYPD spokesperson.\n\n\"It doesn't make sense that FIS - the unit dedicated to facial recognition - is gathering social media evidence instead of doing facial recognition.\"\n\nThere is a separate department within the NYPD, the Social Media Analysis & Research Team (SMART), which \"analyzes social media for chatter, videos and relative information in regards to active investigations.\" And department officials have said in the past that once the FIS generates a match, an \"investigator proceeds with further research, including an examination of social media and other open-source images,\" as then-NYPD commissioner James O'Neill wrote in The New York Times last year.\n\nBut the public defenders who have seen these documents sharply dispute the NYPD explanation that these social media matches were generated manually - they say the paperwork makes clear it was an FIS database match.\n\n\"The materials labeled the database photo as being from social media,\" said Thaxter. \"So while it may be true that the photograph was originally obtained through a publicly accessible account, the photo would have had to have been pulled from that account and placed in the database to be located using FIS - which is exactly what the paperwork says happened.\"\n\n\"It tells me that their database of photos does not just contain photos of individuals that have been arrested or convicted,\" he added. \"Somebody is making a decision to put individual photos into this database.\"\n\nGreco agreed. \"It doesn't make sense that FIS - the unit dedicated to facial recognition - is gathering social media evidence instead of doing facial recognition when there's an entire unit known as SMART that does that exact work,\" he said.\n\nGreco provided HuffPost an intelligence report from the SMART team that he received in another case. In this case, the form indicates that the SMART unit was contacted by a detective to conduct a \"social media canvas\" of an \"FB user.\" In a different juvenile case where social media was searched, the department's Juvenile Justice Division provided Thaxter a form showing that the New York City law department, the city's legal division that prosecutes juveniles, conducted a \"social media inquiry\" on a person of interest. These would be the typical ways a SMART search would be communicated in paperwork - not on an FIS form.\n\nNeither Thaxter nor Greco got the chance to ask more questions about facial recognition in these two cases, because both cases were dismissed. Thaxter noted that because of the state's current strict discovery laws, where the prosecution doesn't have to provide evidence to the defense until close to the trial, roughly 90% of his cases never reach the discovery phase. However, on Jan. 1, 2020, a new law went into effect in New York state that will force the police and prosecutors to turn over evidence much earlier in cases.\n\nThaxter expects that his office will be seeing a lot more cases where they'll learn how facial recognition was used to investigate their clients.\n\nThese revelations are especially alarming in the context of recent reports that rogue NYPD officers are using Clearview AI, a highly controversial facial recognition software, on their phones. The department has not sanctioned that activity and may punish the officers, but there is clearly a disinclination among at least some police officers to respect basic privacy rights and bend or break safeguards around the use of facial recognition software.\n\nThe NYPD has long resisted calls for more transparency around its facial recognition program. And as cities around the country are having a debate over police use of facial recognition - with cities like San Francisco, Oakland and the Boston suburb of Somerville, Massachusetts, outright banning it - New York City and the NYPD have fought to keep information about its facial recognition program secret.\n\nGeorgetown's Center on Privacy and Technology has for years tried to get the complete picture of the NYPD's facial recognition program, and filed a lawsuit over it. As a result, in late 2018, the NYPD was forced to turn over about 3,700 pages on its program.\n\nHuffPost asked Clare Garvie - one of the legal researchers leading Georgetown's investigation into the NYPD's use of facial recognition - about the documents in question in the two cases from Legal Aid and Bronx Defenders. After reviewing the records, she said, \"The question becomes, why is the Facial Information Unit search returning a social media photo when, as far as we're aware, the database is made up of mugshots and pistol identification photos?\"\n\nThe public might also learn more about exactly what information is being fed into FIS if a new law being considered by the New York City Council titled the Public Oversight of Surveillance Technology Act passes, which would mandate that the city and the police department tell the public more about its policies and practices with facial recognition technology. More than half of the New York City Council supports the POST Act . As part of that bill, advocates have pushed for lawmakers to force the department to disclose all the ways that it is monitoring social media.\n\nThe NYPD has been extremely combative in response to these proposed reforms; the department has called the POST Act \" insane .\" At the first city council hearing on the proposed law, the police department continued to lobby against it.\n\nStill, the scrutiny on the NYPD over how useful these tools are persists. Earlier this month, New York State Senator Brad Hoylman (D) introduced a bill that would outright ban the use of facial recognition and other biometric tools by police in the state. In the bill, Hoylman cites several recent troubling reports on the NYPD's use of facial recognition, including the presence of juvenile photos in the database.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "NYPD Calls Unreasonable Use Of Force 'Irresponsible' After Trump's Speech\n\nSenior Editor, HuffPost\n\nThe New York Police Department released a statement on Saturday reiterating their use of force policies after President Donald Trump suggested police officers be more rough with their suspects during a Friday speech to invited law enforcement officers.\n\nIn a statement emailed to HuffPost, the NYPD called suggestions for police officers to use alternative standards for use of force \"irresponsible\" and \"unprofessional.\"\n\n\"The NYPD's training and policies relating to the use of force only allow for measures that are reasonable and necessary under any circumstances, including the arrest and transportation of prisoners,\" a spokesman for NYPD said.\n\n\"To suggest that police officers apply any standard in the use of force other than what is reasonable and necessary is irresponsible, unprofessional and sends the wrong message to law enforcement as well as the public.\"\n\nWhile speaking about the administration's efforts to take on international gangs to law enforcement officers at the Suffolk County Community College in Long Island, New York, Trump joked that officers should be rougher with suspects and suggested letting them hit their heads on police cars.\n\n\"When you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon, you just see them thrown in, rough, and I said, 'Please don't be too nice,'\" Trump said.\n\n\"Like when you guys put somebody in the car and you're protecting their head, you know, the way you put their hand over, like, don't hit their head and they've just killed somebody,\" he added. \"Don't hit their head, I said, 'You can take the hand away, OK?'\"\n\nHis remarks elicited cheers from the audience of law enforcement, which included local lawmakers , officers from the Suffolk County Police Department, the Nassau County Police Department acting police commissioner Patrick Ryder , Suffolk County Sheriff Vincent DeMarco and deputies and jail guards from the Suffolk County Sheriff's office, according to Newsday reporter Nicole Fuller.\n\nA NYPD spokesman told HuffPost that no one in their department attended Trump's speech on Friday.\n\nHuffPost reached out to the White House for further clarification on who was invited and who attended the speech.\n\nNYPD joins a growing number of law enforcement agencies, officers and organizations that have denounced the president's remarks on Friday, including the Suffolk County Police Department, which reportedly had over 100 officers who attended Trump's speech .\n\nPhillip Atiba Goff, the founder of the New York-based Center for Policing Equity , said in a statement issued Friday evening that Trump's speech was \"dangerous,\" dehumanizing and \"implied a disrespect for the rule of law.\" Goff also said that he has spoken to police chiefs and officers who are \"disgusted\" by \"the president's statements ― and the applause\" it received.\n\n\"Unchecked police force is not tough. It is not 'manly' and it does not reduce crime,\" Goff said in the statement emailed to HuffPost. \"What it does accomplish is to make crime victims less likely to call 911 for help because they fear how police will treat them.\"\n\nGoff added that Trump's Friday remarks were dangerous because it would make even bystanders less likely to report violent crimes for fear of violent treatment from police. Goff also said that excessive force could endanger other officers.\n\n\"Punitive force by any member of law enforcement is potentially a precursor to violence against the next officer encountering that individual,\" Goff said. \"Excessive force dehumanizes all involved, both police and public.\"\n\nSimilar to NYPD's statement, the International Association of Police Chiefs on Friday defended strict use of force policies that require officers to treat all individuals \"with dignity and respect,\" calling it \"the bedrock principle\" behind police legitimacy.\n\nThe Suffolk County Police Department in New York and the Gainesville Police Department also tweeted in response to Trump's speech on Friday. Suffolk County police said their department will not tolerate \"roughing up of prisoners,\" while the Gainesville police rejected Trump's speech which they said \"endorsed and condoned police brutality.\"\n\nAs a department, we do not and will not tolerate roughing up of prisoners.\n\nThe @POTUS made remarks today that endorsed and condoned police brutality. GPD rejects these remarks and continues to serve with respect.\n\nI'm a cop. I do not agree with or condone @POTUS remarks today on police brutality. Those that applauded and cheered should be ashamed.\n\nPolice brutality has been a focal point of public concern in recent years. The case of Eric Garner, who was held in a fatal chokehold by an NYPD officer, gained national attention and inspired a wave of protests .\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Is NYPD's 'SnitchBot' A Glimpse Into The Future Of Racist Policing?\n\nContributing Writer\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams and Police Commissioner Keechant Sewell have been pretty enthusiastic about the rollout of three new robocops, which Sewell called tools to \"safeguard our modern city and a forward-looking world.\"\n\nThe rest of us, however, are quietly panicking about a potentially \"Black Mirror\"- esque future where robots roam the streets, carrying out what will inevitably be some pretty racist policing.\n\n\"Digidog,\" one of the robots, is rejoining the NYPD after having its contract cut short in 2020 due to overwhelming complaints that it was \"creepy.\"\n\n\"A few loud people were opposed to it, and we took a step back,\" said Adams during a press conference last Tuesday. \"That is not how I operate. I operate on looking at what's best for the city.\"\n\nThe four-legged, remote-controlled bionic structure is expected to make a comeback as a \"safe way\" for police to intervene during intense armed-hostage situations. Two 70-pound robodogs will cost the department $750,000 and are reportedly equipped with cameras, lights, and two-way communication technology, allowing police to collect surveillance and determine whether a potentially volatile situation is safe for police intervention.\n\nDuring its initial pilot, Digidog was used once during a Bronx home invasion where two men held victims at gunpoint and burned one victim with a hot iron, according to The New York Times . Both suspects reportedly fled the scene before cops arrived.\n\nThe NYPD is also planning to pilot two other surveillance bots, one of which is the K5 Autonomous Security Robot. Some are calling this guy a \" snitchBOT ,\" because it's equipped with dozens of microphones, 360-degree cameras, sonar and a license plate reader. The plan for it is to autonomously patrol Times Square and subway stations, which doesn't sound terrifying and disaster-prone at all.\n\nIt's hard to determine how much \"RoboCop\"-style crime-fighting these innocuous-looking snitches will do, but let's talk about the red flags first. One huge concern is whether these robots will show a racial bias and target Black and brown people - an issue rampant in policing and artificial intelligence. Just a few months ago, a man named Randal Reid was arrested and jailed for days in Atlanta when facial recognition technology incorrectly matched him as a suspect for a crime in Louisiana . It happens all the time - facial recognition tech does not have a great track record of telling us Black and brown people apart.\n\nAccording to Harvard University, facial recognition used by police departments relies on mugshot databases, which are disproportionately Black and Hispanic (thanks largely to historically racist policing practices ). History appears to be repeating itself in a different medium, resulting in some very dangerous inaccuracies. Using robots as law enforcement surveillance only reinforces the methods used to disproportionately strip Black people - and everyone else, actually - of their rights and humanity.\n\nWhen we reached out to the NYPD's press department for comment, a rep replied with a link to the above-referenced press conference. Sewell said at that conference that \"there is a human being behind, and responsible for every mechanism we use, that is our approach to any technological implementation including the public safety including the public safety tools being introduced today.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

The NYPD slowdown has proven the opposite.\n\nSpencer Platt / Getty Images\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nWhat happens when the police go on strike? Over the past two weeks, the New York Police Department (NYPD) has done its part to answer that question. Officers have been on a particular kind of strike called a slowdown: they come to work, but don't do their job as quickly or fully as usual.\n\nWhile police union officials have denied officers are working at a slower pace, arrests in all categories are down more than 50 percent. The decline in traffic violations and minor incidents, like public urination, has been especially pronounced: where arrests for major felonies have dropped by about 20 percent, summonses for low-level crimes and parking and moving violations have decreased by more than 90 percent.\n\nAccording to a New York Times article this past week, \"In Coney Island, the precinct covering that neighborhood did not record a single parking ticket, traffic summons or ticket for a low-level crime like public urination or drinking, the statistics showed.\" This decline in arrests and summons has spilled over into the courtroom :\n\nOne arraignment courtroom instead of two. Clerks watching \"Batman\" on their computer screens and playing with their cellphones as they wait for something to happen. And Manhattan's night court shutting down an hour early because there are no more cases to call.\n\nThose were scenes from the city's arraignment courts in the third week of a precipitous drop in arrests by the New York Police Department . The usual chaotic bustle of the courts - the odd mix of transgressors, from murderers to fare-beaters - has given way to unusual scenes of tranquil inactivity.\n\nThe NYPD has effectively suspended its notorious \"broken windows\" policy, characterized by heavy policing of small-time misdemeanors and minor infractions in the name of preventing more serious crimes. The effect of this practice, under normal conditions, is the over-policing of poor, especially minority, neighborhoods. The homicide of Eric Garner began with police accosting him for illegally selling a few loose cigarettes.\n\nNormally the point of a strike is to halt production to show society, or at least your employers, that they need you. Stopping work imposes costs on others - lowering employers' profits, reducing politicians' legitimacy, increasing consumers' needs - but it only does so because the work that workers do is essential. The work cannot be done without them. This is why employers hire replacement workers, or seek court injunctions to force employees back to work.\n\nIt is also why strikers risk becoming unpopular with the public - the absence of the goods they are producing or the services they provide can become a serious inconvenience. And it is why workers often take care to build public support for their strike, with the hopes that the public attributes those inconveniences to the causes of the stoppage instead of to the strikers themselves.\n\nA perfect example is the 2012 Chicago Teachers Union strike , which shut down the first days of school. This caused some headaches for working families and their children, but because of the union's pre-strike community organizing, those families largely supported the teachers against city government. The strike proved how important the teachers were, and why they deserved more respect than they received.\n\nThe irony of the NYPD strike is that it has demonstrated the opposite. When police do not do their jobs, at least as defined under current policy, the costs are low. There is no dramatic damage to public safety. Relative to the precipitous drop in policing, there have been very minor increases in violent crime. Nor are the other costs, such as the decline in revenue from fines and tickets, particularly significant. Meanwhile, the benefits to (formerly) over-policed neighborhoods is large.\n\nWith their slowdown, New York police officers have shown that most of their activities are inessential. Society is better off when they are not engaging in broken windows, quality-of-life harassment of poor neighborhoods. The next logical step is to simply normalize the present. In the infamous words of one former vice president, this should be the \"new normal.\"\n\nAlex Gourevitch is an associate professor of political science at Brown University and the author of From Slavery To the Cooperative Commonwealth: Labor and Republican Liberty in the Nineteenth Century .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\n\"The reason the morale of the police department of the city of New York is so low,\" Rudolph Giuliani thundered outside City Hall, \"is one reason, and one reason alone: David Dinkins !\"\n\nIn the early 1990s, Dinkins , New York City's first black mayor, was short on allies and long on problems. The local economy was fragile. Violent crime had yet to noticeably ebb, with more than two thousand people murdered in the five boroughs every year. Racial divisions were stark.\n\nRudy Giuliani was eager to pile on.\n\nBefore he was Donald Trump's disgraced counsel , Giuliani was the prince of white New York, a mayor-in-waiting. In 1989, running as a Republican, he had nearly beaten Dinkins, who dethroned another favorite of outer borough reactionaries in the Democratic primary that year, Ed Koch. Giuliani may have been ghoulish then, but he was taken far more seriously by the city's cognoscenti. He was still famous for busting mobsters as the US attorney for the Southern District, winning front page after front page at a time when tabloid news coverage could raise heroes from dust.\n\nThe Giuliani image was multilayered, aided and abetted by a fawning press corps. To the many men and women who covered his legal exploits and preening for the cameras, Giuliani was a reformer free of the taint of the Democratic machines. Koch had risen and fallen with these old-school patronage networks; Giuliani would be something better, they fathomed, a neo-Fiorello La Guardia rescuing the city from chaos. If they were looking for promising signs, they could point to Giuliani the candidate's defense of abortion rights and his occasional kind word for immigrants.\n\nA courtly politician who would appear at times disengaged from day-to-day municipal affairs, Dinkins knew the 1993 rematch was going to be brutal. His 1989 victory had been quietly revolutionary, joining together working-class blacks and liberal whites in the kind of rainbow coalition that seemed otherwise impossible in the nadir of the right-wing 1980s. Dinkins as mayor was a cautious moderate with some progressive impulses, managing to pour billions of dollars over the course of his term into dilapidated housing while overseeing austerity budgets.\n\nIn a high-crime era, Dinkins successfully fought to hire more police. But an expansion of the New York Police Department (NYPD) was not enough to placate the cops or their favored politician, Giuliani. Dinkins was a black man who spoke out occasionally on police brutality; for the revanchist police unions, this was the equivalent of declaring war.\n\nIt all came to a head when Dinkins announced he would create a civilian agency to oversee the police and attempt to check their power. Dinkins was at least the second mayor to try this. In the 1960s, another liberal, John Lindsay, had attempted to install a civilian review board, only to meet backlash from the police unions, who reviled the mayor for siding with black and Puerto Rican residents. \"I am sick and tired of giving in to minority groups, with their whims and their gripes and shouting,\" said John Cassese, who led the Police Benevolent Association (PBA), the union for rank-and-file cops, in that era. The PBA helped crush Lindsay's review board in a public referendum.\n\nFor decades, the NYPD had existed as a fiefdom unto its own, operating largely independently from the rest of the city. After Lindsay's experience, no mayor wanted to take them on. Koch, as a candidate, made noise about cops being overpaid and not patrolling like they should, but he quickly became a staunch supporter of police once he entered office in 1978. By 1989, when Koch was fighting for a fourth term and struggling to fend off Dinkins, he raced straight to the PBA. \"You stand between us and the murderers and the rapists and the assaulters,\" Koch declared as he took their endorsement. \"You are that thin blue line.\"\n\nWith crime stubbornly high, enough voters could buy the line of Koch and other law-and-order politicians. But many others, particularly African Americans in the outer boroughs, were fed up with a police department that not only failed to protect them from crime but regularly brutalized them with impunity. In 1978, police choked to death a businessman named Arthur Miller in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. In 1983, the same thing happened to a young artist, Michael Stewart, who was caught spray-painting graffiti on the wall of the First Avenue subway station in Manhattan's East Village. A year later, police killed an elderly woman named Eleanor Bumpurs who was in the process of being evicted from her Bronx public housing apartment.\n\nBy 1992, Dinkins was serious about creating the agency, which would come to be known as the Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB). The powers of the oversight body would be relatively limited - there would be no authority to fire officers who were corrupt or killed civilians - but it would exist, as the minimum, as a layer of bureaucracy independent of the department, able to investigate cases of misconduct and produce public findings.\n\nThat summer, a police officer shot and killed a Dominican immigrant named José García in Washington Heights. Police were incensed that Dinkins dared to express sympathy for García's family, since García had a drug conviction. Dinkins had the gall, in their view, to invite García's family to Gracie Mansion, the stately mayoral residence on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.\n\nOn September 16, 1992, more than ten thousand off-duty police officers and their supporters were bused to City Hall Park to protest Dinkins's plan for the review board. The rally began normally enough, with chants and songs. In uniform were about three hundred police officers who were supposed to control the crowd. Dinkins was away at a funeral for a congressman.\n\nQuickly, the protest devolved. Off-duty police broke through barricades, storming onto the steps of City Hall. \"Take the hall!\" they chanted, meeting no resistance from their uniformed colleagues. The rioters climbed onto cars and dented them, some swilling beer. With them was Giuliani, who was stumping for mayor against Dinkins. A Giuliani supporter moved through the crowd handing out voter registration cards.\n\nMany rioters wore T-shirts bearing the words \"Dinkins Must Go\" and buttons with the slogan \"Fight Crime. Dump Dinkins.\" Several displayed inflammatory and racist signs, including one depicting Dinkins with a large afro and swollen lips. Another called Dinkins a \"washroom attendant.\" Attendees chanted, \"The mayor's on crack!\"\n\nSome of the men confronted Una Clarke, a City Council member from Brooklyn who was outside City Hall. Both she and a black television cameraman were called the N-word.\n\nWhen the highest-ranking uniformed officer in the department, Chief David Scott, begged the off-duty police to move off the steps of City Hall, he was loudly booed. While many of the protesting police refused to leave City Hall, others spilled out onto the surrounding streets, blocking traffic. Broken beer bottles littered the roadway. Uniformed officers, in some instances, egged on protesters.\n\nAlong with Giuliani, Philip Caruso, the PBA president, railed against Dinkins and the civilian review board. \"The forces of evil are all around,\" he said. \"They are trying to surround us. They are trying to defeat us.\"\n\nThe City Hall contingent of rioters, hungry for action, broke out in another direction, heading for the nearby Brooklyn Bridge. The iconic crossing was quickly jammed in both directions. More than two thousand police milled on the roadways, holding up cars for almost an hour. A New York Times photographer was surrounded by demonstrators, punched, and shoved.\n\nThe off-duty cops remained on the bridge for almost an hour, eventually dissipating. Dinkins, speaking to the media, later assailed Giuliani, who was viewed as a ringleader of the riot. \"He's clearly, clearly an opportunist,\" Dinkins said. \"He's seizing upon a fragile circumstance in our city for his own political gain.\"\n\nDinkins was unbowed. A year later, the Civilian Complaint Review Board was created, the first all-civilian agency in New York to oversee police misconduct.\n\nIn the fall, Giuliani got his rematch against Dinkins. The election, once again, pitted white, conservative New York against the multiracial Dinkins coalition. This time, the deeply polarized election yielded a narrow victory for Giuliani, who was helped along by robust support from white ethnic neighborhoods, particularly in the borough of Staten Island, which voted overwhelmingly that year, in a referendum that would never get state approval, to secede from the rest of the city.\n\nDinkins was gracious in defeat, and Giuliani went on to burnish the myth that he had saved New York from chaos, capitalizing on a drop in the murder rate that was national in scope and had begun when Dinkins was still mayor. The CCRB, though never the transformational body it was pitched as, persisted: it remains in existence today.\n\nPolice unions would continue to rail against it and whatever mild reforms appeared in subsequent years. Another aggressive supporter of police power, Michael Bloomberg, became mayor after Giuliani, but he was followed by a former Dinkins aide named Bill de Blasio.\n\nDe Blasio was no revolutionary. But he had campaigned on promising to curtail the use of a controversial policing tactic known as stop-and-frisk and improve relations between police and communities of color. After a policeman killed Eric Garner in 2014, De Blasio's first year in office, he spoke movingly about how he had to warn his biracial son about police interactions.\n\nThe worst police revolt in decades ensued. At two funerals for slain policeman, officers turned their backs, literally, on De Blasio. Patrick Lynch, a PBA president as reactionary as his predecessors, declared De Blasio had \"blood on [his] hands.\" In the early months of 2015, police initiated a de facto work stoppage. Violent crime remained low, undercutting the message that they were the thin blue line, in Koch's words, between \"the murderers and the rapists.\"\n\nSince then, the rise of progressive Democrats in New York has diminished the PBA's political clout. Lynch's endorsement of Trump in 2020 guaranteed most Democrats, outside of a select few in suburban-style neighborhoods, would stop seeking out the PBA's endorsement altogether. But while the PBA is no longer the force it was under Dinkins, the memory of police revolt and a city politics dominated by crime fears lingers on.\n\nRoss Barkan is a Jacobin columnist based in New York City.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nWhen Eric Adams became New York City mayor in 2022, he brought a lot of old friends to City Hall. One of those associates, from his years at the New York Police Department, is Timothy Pearson.\n\nA retired NYPD sergeant, Pearson was hired by the New York City Economic Development Corporation, a nonprofit that functions as a quasi-city agency, which allowed him to briefly collect a $242,600 salary as \"senior advisor for public safety and COVID recovery\" while simultaneously enjoying his NYPD pension ($124,000) and working as an executive at the Resorts World New York City casino in Queens. When these unusually lucrative arrangements were exposed by local reporters, he dropped the casino gig.\n\nPearson and the mayor go back some thirty years; the two even traveled to Turkey together in 2015. Politico called him \"the most powerful New Yorker you've never heard of,\" noting that Adams often tapped his friend for sensitive tasks, be it helping install Adams's younger brother as head of the mayor's security, flying to Israel with former chief of staff Frank Carone , or heading to El Paso, Texas, to suss out information about asylum seekers traveling to New York.\n\nWhile the Adams administration has no lack of shady characters, it's Pearson's connection to the issue of asylum seekers that raises questions that have yet to be answered by the ever-growing reams of reporting on the Adams indictment. While many of Adams's worst acts - trying to defund the public library system, cutting back on the city's universal pre-K childcare program, sweeping homeless people off the streets and out of the subway system - were perfectly legal, his elevation of Pearson to a key role in handling the safety and security of the growing number of asylum seekers in New York is another matter entirely.\n\nThe City reported last year that Pearson \"runs point for City Hall on security in migrant shelters.\" That entailed setting up security for the makeshift shelters in all five boroughs, which meant meeting with Molly Schaeffer, the city official in charge of asylum-seeker operations, on an almost daily basis from late 2022 through late 2023. Pearson also began heading the Office of Municipal Services Assessment, a somewhat mysterious new agency that aims to save costs for the city and has played a key role in handling contracts related to serving asylum seekers.\n\nIn this role, again per the City , Pearson \"blocked a major migrant casework contract for months, hampering efforts to help shelter residents get authorization to work in the US.\" The contract with Cherokee Nation Management and Consulting, LLC, had already been approved by the agency in charge of the effort, the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation, a public-benefit authority that administers thousands of beds in city migrant shelters.\n\nYet Pearson delayed Cherokee's January 1 start date \"by three months without explanation - putting off meetings, not responding to HHC's communications about the contract, at a time of increasingly desperate need for the case management services, particularly help with work authorization papers, travel and housing to enable people to leave the shelter system.\" As one source put it, he asked \"all sorts of questions that were out of line.\"\n\nWhy would he do that? Well, according to a court filing , Pearson was prone to demanding kickbacks by asking, \"Where's my crumbs?\" earning him an unforgettable nickname around his secret office : \"Crumbs.\" The question is whether Pearson sought payment from Cherokee and held up the contract in hopes of receiving it.\n\nDespite Adams's consistent defense of his buddy, none of this is out of character for Pearson. The New York Times reported in July that the power broker had already racked up four sexual harassment complaints just this year alone, encompassing an array of allegations: vulgar and abusive toward female subordinates, homophobic slurs, and suggestions of a \"quid pro quo sexual relationship.\" Three of the complaints were brought by male police officials, one of whom told the Times that \"he was disgusted by Mr. Pearson's treatment of women at a small unit Mr. Adams created to improve government efficiency.\"\n\nThen there's the Department of Investigation case over Pearson's actions on October 17, 2023. That day, he went to a Randalls Island migrant shelter with more than one hundred police officers, two drones, and a helicopter in order to conduct a \"quality of life sweep\" and look for four individuals apparently accused of assaulting a police officer. When the shelter's site manager asked Pearson for a warrant, legally required to search the premises, witnesses said Pearson threatened the manager's job and insisted on entering the shelter, where the cops nonetheless failed to find whoever they were looking for.\n\nThat would be quite a day at the office for most people. Yet later that same day, he also tried to enter a Touro University building being used as a shelter for asylum seekers without identifying himself, apparently to inspect a fire code violation. When he was denied entry, he allegedly assaulted the security guard.\n\nSchaeffer, the head of the asylum seeker office, has since received a subpoena, suggesting her communications with Pearson may be of interest to the Southern District of New York in its ongoing investigation into the Adams administration. Pearson had his phone seized by the FBI and his home raided in September. He has since resigned, telling reporters, \"I've decided to focus on family, self-care, and new endeavors.\"\n\nThat this is the person in whose hands asylum seekers' safety rested is a scandal and an abomination. For once, it might even be a crime too.\n\nAlex N. Press is a staff writer at Jacobin who covers labor organizing.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

But I can also tell you some people are irredeemable, and unless they are treated very, very differently, they pose a danger to our society.\"\n\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio offered these ominous words after the October 20 shooting death of NYPD officer Randolph Holder, and the swift arrest and arraignment of suspect Tyrone Howard.\n\nIn recent months, de Blasio and NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton have touted reforms to bail requirements and the expansion of public health care services as their progressive response to excessive court delays, overcrowding, and rampant abuse at New York's Rikers Island jail complex.\n\nBut - perhaps for fear of being seen as too soft by those bastions of journalistic integrity, the New York Post and New York Daily News - these self-proclaimed reformers are now tripping over themselves to flash their tough-on-crime credentials.\n\nOnce again , the killing of a New York City police officer is being used to shift the discussion away from the much more consistent and unaccountable brutality on the part of police officers - and this time as an opportunity to disparage drug diversion programs that offer alternatives to incarceration.\n\nThe mayor, who promotes himself nationally as a leading liberal, raced to put himself in front of the law-and-order backlash, pushing to change state law to allow New York judges more power to consider \"dangerousness\" - as opposed to merely flight risk - when imposing bail, and to make the rules more stringent when recommending defendants for drug treatment programs.\n\nHad these rules been in place, de Blasio claimed, \"Tyrone Howard would have gone to jail. He would not have continued to poison the community around him by selling drugs. He wouldn't have been roaming East Harlem on Tuesday, and one of NYPD's good, decent, hardworking cops would still be alive today.\"\n\nFor his part, Bratton declared that Howard \"is the poster boy for not being diverted [into a drug treatment program].\"\n\nYet a number of details about Howard's case and personal history are worth considering more carefully than the tabloids and even more reputable media sources seem capable or willing.\n\nFirst, it's impossible to ignore the glaring double standard on display in this case when compared to, for example, those of eighteen-year-old Ramarley Graham, twenty-eight-year-old Akai Gurley, or forty-three-year-old Eric Garner.\n\nWhile all of these men were unarmed, and it was clear who killed them, indictments against the officers who shot and killed Graham and Gurley took nearly three months of activist pressure to obtain. Graham's killer, Officer Richard Haste, eventually had his indictment tossed out of court, while the case against Gurley's killer, Officer Peter Liang, is ongoing. Infamously, Officer Daniel Pantaleo, who choked Garner to death on a video seen by millions, was never even charged.\n\nTyrone Howard, on the other hand, was indicted the day after the shooting and is being held without bail. \"I hope you burn,\" one officer is said to have yelled during the arraignment. It would be hard to imagine one of Akai Gurley's friends or family members getting away with saying that to Officer Peter Liang.\n\nWhile it remains to be seen whether or not Liang will serve any jail time, everybody knows Howard is already as good as convicted.\n\nTabloids relish the opportunity to use the term \"cop killer\" - a special designation used to denote a person much worse than one who murders an ordinary civilian - and Howard is no exception to this rule.\n\nHolder and his partner were in plainclothes during the incident , however, so it's quite possible that the shooter was unaware that Holder was a cop. Despite this fact, during the official news conference, one reporter tried less than subtly to implicate the Black Lives Matter movement by asking Bratton, \"Do you feel that there's a possibility of anti-police mentality . . . which is fostering, maybe emboldening people with guns?\"\n\nAt the same press conference, de Blasio implored New Yorkers\n\nto show solidarity and to understand the bond we need to have between all of us and our police. We need to understand that the police are us, they are made up of every community, every type of New Yorker. It's a moment to dig deeper and find that solidarity that we need. . . .\n\nI urge all New Yorkers today to reflect upon this moment and do something simple: thank the police officers you come across today because they're in pain. Every single one of them is in pain, they've lost a member of their family. That's another step towards creating a bond between police and community that will make us a better city and make us safer.\n\nThese words must ring deafeningly hollow to the families of Ramarley Graham, Akai Gurley, Eric Garner, and countless others whose encounters with the NYPD have given no reason to thank them or make anyone feel safer. On the contrary, thousands of police officers in this city have caused endless pain and destroyed lives and families - and have yet to be brought to justice.\n\nThat is the reality that the mayor is asking his constituents to simply forget. While Howard is portrayed as the ultimate monster, the killers of Graham, Gurley, and Garner, we were told, had only good intentions.\n\nThe unspoken truth, of course, is that had Holder - a Guyanese immigrant shot and killed near an East Harlem housing project - been a civilian, his death wouldn't have led to a press conference with the mayor and might not have made it onto the news at all.\n\nWhile the mayor and police chief joined the campaign to turn Howard into the boogeyman, Judge Edward McLaughlin stood by his original recommendation for drug diversion as \"accurate and appropriate\" given Howard's struggle with drug addiction, the fact that his previous convictions were for nonviolent felonies, and the lack of any sign that prison time had helped.\n\nDe Blasio's claim that Officer Holder \"would be alive today\" had McLaughlin ruled differently appears even more cravenly opportunistic when you consider, as a court spokesperson noted , that Howard \"also could have been out on bail awaiting trial\" if he hadn't been offered diversion.\n\nAs it was, Howard had a warrant out for his arrest and, according to his brother, considered turning himself in as he battled with his addiction to PCP.\n\nFirst incarcerated at age thirteen and held for three years in a juvenile detention facility - and with two prison terms related to drug charges as an adult behind him, Howard knows New York's system of jails and prisons well.\n\nIn fact, the case could just as easily be made that Howard's time served in jails and prisons pushed him, as it does so many others, further away from legitimate means of employment and increasingly toward acts of desperation and potential violence. Obviously, job prospects for a youthful offender with two felony convictions and twenty-eight arrests are all but nonexistent.\n\nIt's precisely this cycle, described in painful detail in Michelle Alexander's The New Jim Crow , that seems to be Tyrone Howard's story - if we apply de Blasio's advice to \"dig deeper\" with Tyrone Howard and view him as the human being he is.\n\nBratton demonstrated that he is well aware of this cycle in his response to a reporter's question about the national push to reduce incarceration:\n\nWhile I'm supportive.  . . of efforts to reduce arrests, summonses, reduce some of our activities as it relates particularly to minor drug types of crimes . . . what is missing in this effort - and it is a big miss - is that currently at the federal level, oftentimes at the state and local level, as people are coming out of jail, they're coming out into an environment in which there is nothing there for them.. . .\n\nThere's not a safety net, and the expectation, the concern, the warning if you will - the red flag that I'm raising and some of my colleagues are raising in the law enforcement community - is that we can expect to see those individuals reverting back to a life of crime. Some of them even when they're given opportunities will go back to that life of crime - because that's what they are is criminals.\n\nNote the tap dance at the end of that statement. Bratton begins by acknowledging that people like Tyrone Howard are failed by a system that dooms them to lives spent under the control the criminal justice system. But then he shifts back to the familiar narrative about irredeemable criminals - the implication being that Howard is one of the latter - thereby clearing society of any responsibility for Holder's death.\n\nThis is the tightrope that Bratton and his boss de Blasio are walking, between reforming the most egregious police and prison abuses and maintaining the \" broken windows \" policing strategy that produces them.\n\nThe more than 2.3 million people currently incarcerated in the US make the country's image as \"the world's greatest democracy\" increasingly difficult to uphold. This, along with budget deficits and grassroots protest, has led to a debate about mass incarceration even among US elites, and to both local reforms like de Blasio's and the impending release of up to forty thousand federal prisoners.\n\nPredictably, these efforts are meeting with resistance from those who want to keep America's prison gulag fully intact. For these forces, Tyrone Howard and the image of the hardened criminal who is, as de Blasio put it, \"irredeemable\" fits an obvious need.\n\nBy pushing to allow judges to factor in \"dangerousness\" when setting bail, de Blasio is making it clear that his reaction to Holder's death will not be to fight for stronger services for those leaving prison, but instead a \"lock 'em up\" tilt to the right.\n\nWhen it was suggested that Howard, under these recommended provisions, might still have been eligible for drug diversion because selling drugs is considered a nonviolent crime, a de Blasio spokesperson suggested that selling drugs \"is a dangerous crime.\"\n\nAs the Legal Aid Society put it in a statement , \"Changing the law to undermine the presumption of innocence is not the answer, and would have disastrous consequences for fairness in our criminal justice system.\"\n\nAttorney Justine Luongo expanded on the point in a comment to the Observer : \"When the mayor takes the position that drug cases are dangerous, this is why we're opposing this. Because this notion of an over-broad definition of what 'dangerousness' is, is going to have a disproportionate effect on people with mental illness, poor people, and people of color.\"\n\nThe contradiction - ironically pointed out by Bratton himself - between the inevitable problems of crime and violence engendered by profound social inequality, and the non-solution of mass incarceration that only exacerbates the problem, will continue to sharpen in the months and years ahead. Activists have an important role to play in articulating and fighting for real solutions.\n\nDe Blasio has demonstrated once again that he is at best a cowardly \"ally\" in this fight. More accurately, his supposedly progressive administration has combined a few positive but limited reforms with giving liberal cover for disastrous Broken Windows policies - and now the truly dangerous conception of the \"irredeemably criminal.\"\n\nThis is, after all, the argument that has undergirded the harsh sentencing laws and practices that have helped drive incarceration to the current, shameful rate of 716 per 100,000 residents . It insidiously requires that we cease seeing people as human beings and treat them, as de Blasio eerily suggests, \"very, very differently.\" Once we accept that argument, the logic of punitive measures follows.\n\nWe should be careful not to fall into this trap. And we need to step up the fight, not just for alternatives to incarceration, but for further structural changes - equal access to well-paying jobs with good benefits, decent affordable housing, educational opportunities, health care and more - that can offer a real alternative to crime and violence.\n\nLichi D'Amelio is a New York City-based activist and a member of the International Socialist Organization.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

The uprising against police brutality, in New York and around the country, has suddenly put serious momentum behind those demands.\n\nNYPD officers block the exit of the Manhattan Bridge as hundreds protesting police brutality and systemic racism attempt to cross into the borough of Manhattan from Brooklyn hours after a citywide curfew went into effect in New York City.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nAs protesters continue to meet a massive police presence on the streets of New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio and the city council are under pressure to defund the New York City Police Department (NYPD) and reduce its power. Momentum is building for cuts - the question is how substantial those cuts will be.\n\nThe uprising in response to the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis is pressing cities and institutions across the country to defund police departments and reinvest in social programs in working-class communities and communities of color. The demand is rooted in the belief that years of new training, body cameras, and attempts to discipline \"bad apples\" has failed to address what activists say is the root problem : that the criminal justice system is historically rooted in class and racial control and empowers officers to abuse and kill . No amount of retraining, these activists argue, can change this fundamental function of the police. What's needed is a defunding of police and a shifting of those public resources toward an entirely new approach to public safety.\n\nOn Wednesday, Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti announced the city would cut $100-150 million of the city's police department budget. This followed the Minneapolis school board's vote on Tuesday to end its contract with the police department and the University of Minnesota's recent commitment to scale back its ties with the police.\n\nIn New York City, advocates have been calling since April for the city to rethink its priorities in the wake of the pandemic and make cuts to the NYPD, the nation's largest police force. The uprising is giving new momentum and shape to those demands.\n\nSince Mayor Bill de Blasio took office in 2014, the NYPD's budget has increased by more than $1 billion to nearly $6 billion in 2019, though the proceeds it receives from contracts remain shrouded in secrecy . This $6 billion amounts to more than the budgets for the Departments of Health ($1.9 billion), Homeless Services ($2.1 billion), Youth and Community Development ($907 million), and Small Business Services ($293 million) combined.\n\nEven as the city prepares for a new round of austerity due to the pandemic's economic costs, the mayor's proposed budget for fiscal year 2021 leaves the NYPD nearly untouched while proposing vast cuts to a range of other social programs. The NYPD would face a P rogram to Eliminate the Gap (PEG) cut of $16.3 million, as compared to the $470.1 million PEG for the Department of Education, the $177.3 million PEG for the Department of Youth and Community Development, and the $60 million PEG for the Department of Homeless Services. According to the council , the NYPD's budget faces a cut of less than 1 percent, while the Department of Youth and Community Service faces a 32 percent cut.\n\nOn April 30, Communities United for Police Reform and about 110 other organizations, including unions, the Working Families Party, churches, and many other community groups called for the city to redirect NYPD funds to other crucial social services. Council member Brad Lander proposed a hiring freeze, and public safety chair Donovan Richards identified $55 million in cuts through cuts to the cadet class and by reducing overtime for summer events, with other council members backing his call. The NYPD defended its untouchable budget in a virtual hearing in May, arguing that a reduction in the police force could result in a crime spike. Council speaker Corey Johnson of Manhattan cosigned a letter on May 30 calling for 5-7 percent cuts across agencies that had not yet made significant reductions, and singling out the NYPD as one of the agencies that needed slashing.\n\nBut mass numbers of protesters taking to the streets in cities and towns across the country have boosted the case for defunding. Communities United for Police Reform announced on Wednesday that they will fight for a $1 billion cut to the police department's budget in fiscal year 2021. Public advocate Jumaane Williams and council members Carlina Rivera, Antonio Reynoso, Ben Kallos, Carlos Menchaca, and Brad Lander each joined the Wednesday press conference to express their support for significant cuts.\n\nLater that day, 236 current and former staffers who are disappointed in the de Blasio administration released a letter that voiced support for the $1 billion cut. The Policing and Social Justice Project, led by criminologist Alex Vitale , has proposed $1 billion in cuts over four years. On Thursday, comptroller Scott Stringer proposed $1.1 billion cuts over that four-year timeline.\n\n\"We're in a place right now to determine what our next futures look like,\" said Anthonine Pierre, deputy director of the Brooklyn Movement Center, in a Zoom press conference hosted by Communities United for Police Reform on Wednesday. Asked by a reporter whether organizers worry the issue of police reform will fade to the background once protests end, she said, \"The protests are going to last as long as they need to last . . . The only way the issue of police reform fades to the background is if we defund the police, is if we decrease the ability of the NYPD to do things that need to be reformed.\"\n\nAdvocates have proposed different ideas to reduce the budget. A common theme is canceling this year's police academy class for new recruits and implementing a hiring freeze, resulting in a decrease in head count by natural attrition. (The NYPD has a roughly 3 percent attrition rate per year.) Other ideas include cutting overtime, reducing spending on non-personnel contracts and technology-related expenses, cutting the agency's public relations budget, and reducing the NYPD's expansions into social services like social distance outreach and homeless outreach.\n\nCommunities United for Police Reform also wants cuts related to abusive policing, such as savings from firing officers who are on modified duty as a result of their abuse of New Yorkers. They also object to the fact that the city's payouts for police brutality settlements do not come out of the NYPD's budget; one study suggests this may reduce the incentive for the police commissioner to control those costs. While the city council does not have the power to require the NYPD to fire officers on modified duty, the council will soon vote on a bill proposed by council member Richards that would require the NYPD to create a set of transparent guidelines for disciplining officers.\n\nMomentum to defund is growing, especially within the city council's twenty-one-member progressive caucus , but no one knows exactly how negotiations will play out in the council. According to the New York Post , Republican minority leader Steven Matteo, a Staten Island council member, \"opposes ideological cuts but still agreed the NYPD would not be spared\" in this year's budget cuts. Kallos, a Manhattan council member and cochair of the progressive caucus, said in an email on Wednesday that a $1 billion cut should be made as soon as possible, but that the plan to achieve it over four years appears most realistic.\n\nMenchaca, a Brooklyn council member and member of the caucus, says he'll follow the lead of advocates, who are currently calling for a $1 billion cut in the next fiscal year. Council members Lander and Richards, caucus members of Brooklyn and Queens respectively, did not cite specific numbers, but expressed support for several of the advocates' additional ideas, including reducing the NYPD's involvement in social services such as homelessness, mental health, and youth services that could be performed by other agencies and community organizations.\n\n\"That is a much more fundamental reimagining of the infrastructure of public safety than is easy to achieve through budget cuts,\" Lander says. \"So to me, the cuts that we're making here are out of recognition that we have a fiscal crisis, and out of recognition of the demands of the movement for black lives to do something significant in this moment. But they're more likely a down payment on that more fundamental rethinking.\"\n\nThe demand to \"defund\" is currently building a bridge between leftists with abolitionist visions and moderate liberals fed up with cuts to social services. Yet as the council dives more deeply into the NYPD budget, it will have to wrestle with a set of complex questions: To what extent does defunding the NYPD mean ensuring the agency must submit, like all other agencies, to this year's austerity cuts? Or does it mean a deeper shift of what is required to build healthy communities? Does the NYPD need to be subject to a few new accountability measures, or does it need to be vastly reduced?\n\nAt a press conference on Tuesday, Mayor de Blasio emphasized his belief that public safety takes investments in youth programming, programs that harness community leadership to deter violence without criminalizing residents, and other social investments. He also expressed support for additional police reforms. He did not waver, however, from his position that a large police force is crucial to maintaining the public peace.\n\n\"For folks who say 'defund the police,' I would say that is not the way forward. At some point in our history, we may be in a very different situation,\" he said. \"But, right now . . . having a police force that is able to keep everyone safe and able to engage at the community level, having a police force strong enough to do the work of public safety, also the work of building community with people and healing - I think that's necessary for now,\" he said.\n\nAs Jacobin reported Tuesday, the New York City Council has played a major role in enabling the expansion of NYPD since de Blasio took office, and even pushed the administration to boost the police head count in its 2015 budget.\n\n\"In hindsight, I think it was a mistake,\" Lander says, reflecting on the council's push. \"We imagined there would be accountability where there has not been accountability, and that has just grown to be a very real problem. . . . Perhaps it was naive to believe those things.\" Activism on the ground has also compelled him to reimagine what public safety means. \"There are so many elements of public safety that we approach through policing that I'd like to see us take a different approach to - that is an understanding that I've come to.\"\n\nCouncil member Richards says he doesn't regret voting for the increased head count, which helped expand the Neighborhood Coordination Officers (NCO) program that he says has led to significant improvements in community-police relations and greater police diversity in his Queens district, the Far Rockaways. Yet he says the policies of the NYPD have been too slow to change and that, in light of the police reaction to recent protests, the progress made by the NCO program has disappeared.\n\n\"This moment in time and history gives us a lot of momentum to make everlasting changes within the department. And without a doubt, the uprisings around the country, and George Floyd's sacrifice should not be in vain,\" Richards says.\n\nAdvocates are also pushing for a variety of other legislative steps to improve the accountability of the police force, including the Safer New York Act , a package of five bills in the state legislature. These include a repeal of the state's infamous Section 50-a, a statute that protects police misconduct and discipline information from public review. It also includes legislation that would require reports on demographic and geographic data on low-level enforcement as well as reports on police killings and deaths in police custody, strengthen the attorney general office's power over police killings, end marijuana prohibition and direct proceeds to communities impacted by the war on drugs, and reduce arrests for noncriminal offenses. Another bill under consideration would ban racial and ethnic profiling by police. The legislature has announced it will convene next week to vote on a series of criminal justice reform measures. On June 9, the council has plans to vote on a bill that would criminalize the use of police choke hold, along with resolutions to support bills banning and criminalization of the choke hold on a state and federal level. Several other legislative reforms could be in the cards, too.\n\nThe national uprising has clearly given new power to campaigns to make the NYPD more accountable and its budget less untouchable. The hard part for the council will be figuring out how such discussions should translate into legislative and budgetary action.\n\nAbigail Savitch-Lew is a fiction writer and journalist whose articles have appeared in City Limits , Dissent , YES!

The police aren't going to get any nicer - we must defund them, full stop.\n\nDemonstrators denouncing systemic racism in law enforcement face off with a line of NYPD after a citywide curfew on June 4, 2020 in New York City.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThis is a transcript of a talk given by criminologist Alex Vitale for Jacobin 's YouTube political education series \"Stay at Home.\" You can watch the original talk, along with a question-and-answer session, here and subscribe to our YouTube channel here . The talk has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nAfter the police murders of Mike Brown, Eric Garner, Tamir Rice, and so many others, we were told by the Obama administration, local mayors, and police chiefs, \"Don't worry. We see there's a problem, but we're going to fix it. We've got a set of reforms that are going to make it all better. We're going to give the police implicit bias training, de-escalation training, mindfulness training. We're going to hold a series of police-community encounter sessions, where we're going to talk about racism and apologize for past wrongdoings, and at the end maybe we'll take a knee together.\n\n\"We're going to give everybody body cameras; we're going to create some early warning systems to identify those bad apples so that we can weed them out. And then the public will have more trust in the police, so the police can get back to doing the important work that they need to do.\"\n\nThat is almost exactly what President Obama said earlier this week in his town hall: that we need to go back to those reforms of five years ago, because we didn't quite do enough of it. We need to get more buy-in; we need to have more police-community encounter sessions, and that will fix policing.\n\nBut Minneapolis has done all of this already. The city actually wrote a report in 2018 detailing all the fantastic procedural reforms that they had adopted, the whole menu from the Obama task force on twenty-first-century policing - the highest expression of what we call \"procedural justice.\" And what all these reforms share is this idea that the problems of policing are problems of professionalism and individual-level bias, and maybe a lack of transparency and formal accountability systems. And if we just fix those things, then policing can go back to its normal function of preserving law and order.\n\nBut what these procedural reforms fail to account for is the fact that the problems are in what the police are tasked with doing - not how they are doing it.\n\nPart of the reason we make this mistake is that we've been driven by a growing number of horrific individual incidents of extreme police violence and murder. But the problems of policing are about so much more than that. The problems of policing are about over-policing. And over the last five years, as all these reforms have been implemented, we have seen no change to that problem of over-policing. And there hasn't even been any reduction in the levels of police violence and killings.\n\nWe have almost nothing to show for the tens of millions of dollars that we've pumped into the budgets of American police to fix policing.\n\nThe anger we see on the streets in Minneapolis and across the country is in part an expression of that frustration, about the fact that we were sold a bill of goods - that these mayors trotted out these reforms to placate our movements, so that we would go to sleep and they could go back to waging a war on drugs, and a war on crime, and a war on gangs, and a war on immigrants, and a war on terror, as they always have; to flood our schools with police, to turn drugs into a criminal justice issue, to drive the homeless and those with mental health challenges into the jails.\n\nThis is not a solution to our society's problems - it's a way of papering over them, of trying to build legitimacy for a political and economic system that is producing mass homelessness, producing mass untreated mental illness, producing mass drug death.\n\nIt's time that we quit trying to make police friendlier, nicer, more law-abiding.\n\nWe don't need to give narcotics officers antibias training to deal with the racism in the war on drugs. We need to end the war on drugs. But our political leaders are not willing to take that on.\n\nThey continue to push austerity policies, in which government resources are used to push wealth up the ladder, to subsidize the most successful parts of the economy, in hope that the results will magically trickle down to the rest of us. Well, I've been a public employee in a union of the state of New York for twenty years now, and I haven't seen any trickle-down yet. That's part of the frustration we see today.\n\nWe have to rethink the way in which we turn every social problem into a problem for the police to solve. We use criminalization as an alternative to having a decent social welfare system, a social safety net, and economic opportunities for people that are distributed more evenly.\n\nHow do we get out of this mess? We've got to take away the police's toys - take away their units, take away their overtime, and reduce police's head count, ideally in a very targeted way, where we eliminate specific functions like school policing and redistribute those resources into public goods that will actually make schools better learning environments for our children. In New York City, we have five thousand NYPD personnel in city schools - more than all counselors and social workers combined. We don't need that.\n\nWhat we need is more counselors, more social workers, more teachers' aides, more high-quality extracurricular activities. And we need to rethink the whole reliance on zero-tolerance disciplining systems that are driven by high-stakes testing regimes, where everyone is doing rote learning by the book. We need to enliven the experience for children, and we need to involve them in the production of a safe school environment instead of criminalizing them.\n\nThe \"defund the police\" movement that we see taking off across the country is the expression of a lot of these ideas that have been percolating across the country for years. I am part of a movement of organizations on the ground, in cities across the country, who have been pushing back against this program of mass criminalization - who have been saying, \"We don't need another jail, we need youth centers. We don't need school police. We don't need the police to be in charge of mental health services, we need actual mental health services.\"\n\nMy hope is that what's happening today across the country will help feed those movements and help build their power. Because I think any movement to create economic and racial justice in the United States has to involve dialing back the power of the carceral apparatus, which is going to be used against us and our movements.\n\nAlex Vitale's book, The End of Policing , is available for free download from Verso here .\n\nAlex S.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe New York City left's plan for working with incoming mayor Bill de Blasio is to use his dependence on progressives' support to hold his feet to the fire when he drifts too far to the right. But will such a strategy work for police policy, with activists aiming to eliminate quotas and stop and frisk, when de Blasio's NYPD commissioner is someone so self-absorbed and intransigent that he earned a pink slip from Rudy Giuliani the last time he held the post, and is a key architect of the policing philosophy that helped produce such reactionary policies in the first place?\n\nThe announcement that the progressive mayor-elect would bring in the mastermind of the aggressive police tactics that defined the city in the 1990s angered progressives. Not only does the choice lessen the possibility of meaningful reform in the NYPD, but it threatens de Blasio's ability to make good on his grand promise to address economic equality in the city.\n\nThe move shouldn't be a surprise. De Blasio needs a law-and-order police head because he fears any rise in crime under his watch would embolden his right-wing critics, and a former NYPD commissioner is an acceptable replacement for Ray Kelly in the eyes of the force's rank and file. (The city's largest police union has already praised the appointment.)\n\nBut the mayor-elect's choice of Bratton goes beyond an attempt to keep an onerous but important constituency placated. De Blasio's choice also signals to the city's finance and real estate sectors that he isn't the Occupy Wall Street candidate some right-wing editorial boards fear - Bratton reportedly says he would have evicted the Zuccotti Park encampment on day one. And then there's Bratton's record of instituting George Kelling and James Q. Wilson's \" broken windows \" theory of policing in New York City - a policing strategy centered on automatic suspicion of the poor and disenfranchised.\n\nIn a clip from the documentary Giuliani Time , Bratton and his then-Deputy Commissioner Jack Maple discuss how their anti-crime tactics were modeled on the British air defense's World War II strategy of predicting where enemy fighters were coming from. Bratton, whose firm demeanor and thick Boston accent are supposed to be symbols of his take-no-shit attitude, was hardly the first American police chief to further militarize public safety. But he stood out as a public servant who very clearly believed that someone who was homeless, lacked money, or was in need of food or medicine was not a victim of circumstance or even a citizen that simply needed help, but a likely enemy soldier in a never-ending war.\n\nPolice sycophants usually respond to this point by celebrating the reduction in crime in the city. But crime has been going down in the nation since the 1980s in general, and different regions and cities have used different policing tactics. The dip in crime is largely a result of capital investment into what were once seen as \"blighted\" inner cities, pushing out existing communities to make way for condos.\n\nFor Bratton, Giuliani, and other adherents to the theory, fixing a neighborhood's broken windows and addressing other \"quality of life\" issues didn't mean cleaning up and investing in a community for the benefit of its inhabitants, but displacing those undesirable residents to the outskirts while attracting a whiter, richer demographic. The drop in crime statistics in a place like Williamsburg and Bushwick is as much the result of high-end real estate developers as the doggedness of the Brooklyn North Command.\n\nThe NYPD's increasing militarization, then, has to be understood as a class issue rather than simply the overzealousness of the state. Gaping inequality, rising rents, and stagnant wages create a growing population for whom the necessities of life are never within reach; a class of people who are to be surveilled, monitored, and generally treated with suspicion until they are eventually forced out of the city.\n\nAnd Bratton's definition of victory in this \"war\" shouldn't be overlooked. The quotas for arrests and stop-and-frisk, criticized by reform advocates and average cops alike, are the result of Bratton's deference to cold metrics. Robert Gangi of the Police Reform Organizing Project illustrates this point by repeating what one cop told him: If a cop breaks up a fight between two kids, he doesn't get any credit. If he delivers a baby in an elevator, he doesn't get any credit. He only gets credit if he brings in an arrest.\n\nBratton has left a legacy of criminological bean counting that is central to twenty-first century policing. Cops are urged to downgrade offenses or dissuade victims from filing police reports out of fear that the numbers would show a rise in crime. As Leonard Levitt explains in his book NYPD Confidential , this system provides no incentive for detectives to conduct long-term investigations that could lead to arrests of major criminals like mob bosses, instead rewarding the street cops who can round up as many low-level drug dealers and petty thieves as possible.\n\nAnd Bratton, who turned his status as a public servant into celebrity, was defensive not only of his policies, but his ability to promote them. As Levitt also documents, Bratton believed the city's media answered to him, not Giuliani - a tension that ultimately led to his ouster.\n\nA de Blasio administration can open opportunities for the Left to hold the mayor accountable. The police violence during Occupy Wall Street and the civil rights communities organizing around stop-and-frisk helped create a new coalition that was able get two pieces of police reform legislation passed in the City Council with a veto-proof majority under Mayor Bloomberg. But Bratton was notorious for running his own show even under Giuliani, a man well-known for his obsession with personal loyalty.\n\nBratton's return is not just startling for New York City, but sets a troubling precedent for progressive Democratic activists in major cities, many of whom look to New York City as a standard setter. Even if the rabble can push the new progressive mayor, on issues of policing, it's unlikely that the commissioner will budge.\n\nAri Paul is a journalist in New York City who has covered politics for the Nation , VICE News , the Guardian , the Forward , the New York Observer , Al Jazeera America , and the Brooklyn Rail .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

But he's not the only \"progressive\" in New York bowing to the boys in blue  - the city council, supposedly to de Blasio's left, has long been under the NYPD's thumb, too.\n\nNYPD officers stand in formation as nearby demonstrators hold a rally in Times Square denouncing racism in law enforcement and the May 25 killing of George Floyd  on June 1, 2020 in New York City. Scott Heins / Getty\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIn 2014, a political revolution happened in New York City. Bill de Blasio stormed into City Hall on a promise of reforming the New York Police Department (NYPD) after twelve years of technocratic and intermittently reactionary rule from mayor Michael Bloomberg. A majority of the City Council was term-limited, replaced by a younger, more progressive cohort.\n\nDe Blasio had been elected on a vow to reduce the police practice of stopping and frisking black and brown New Yorkers. He promised to fundamentally transform the way heavily armed police interacted with a populace that was tired of the NYPD's heavy hand.\n\nIt soon became clear that de Blasio's rhetoric couldn't match reality. His new police commissioner was Bill Bratton, who first gained fame implementing a racist \"broken windows\" policing strategy under mayor Rudy Giuliani. Bratton was picked in part because de Blasio wanted to make a concession to the city elites who were wary of a liberal Democrat taking control of New York City for the first time since the early 1990s. Those who knew de Blasio intimately would say that he believed no progressive reform could occur unless crime remained low and the police were placated - Bratton, the law-and-order bulldog , would be de Blasio's man.\n\nBut something strange happened in 2014. The fifty-one-member City Council, which in some ways was even more progressive than the new mayor, made it clear that it really wanted to hire more police officers . And they eventually got their wish.\n\nToday, New York is convulsed with mass protests against police brutality, while de Blasio continues to defend a police department that has attacked unarmed demonstrators and even plowed a police vehicle straight into a crowd . But there's something else that must be remembered: most of the progressive Democrats decrying the NYPD's behavior today were behind a long-standing campaign to swell the police department's ranks less than a decade ago.\n\n\"More police officers has been something the Council has made a priority for quite some time,\" Jumaane Williams, a former member of the City Council and now the New York City public advocate, said in 2015 . \"I'm disappointed we haven't seen it yet.\"\n\nWilliams, who is second in line to the mayor, remains a prominent critic of the NYPD. But like many of the City Council's left flank in the 2010s, he perplexingly joined the hiring of more police with the cause of reform. It's a stance that, in 2020, puts most elected officials in New York far out of touch with the police reform movement itself, which is firmly uniting behind the idea of shrinking the near $6 billion budget of the department , especially as tax revenues plummet from coronavirus-induced shutdowns.\n\nWhy did so many self-identified progressive council members embrace sending more heavily armed police into vulnerable communities? For some, it was the mistaken idea that crime was somehow spiking after de Blasio took office.\n\n\"Mayor de Blasio and the commissioner have talked about a reduction in citywide crime, but for many colleagues and I, crime has increased in our districts and we have hot pockets of crime around gangs and guns and drugs,\" said Vanessa Gibson, a Bronx city council member who chaired the Public Safety Committee.\n\nGibson was speaking in April 2014, just a few months into de Blasio's first term. Her demand was simple: the NYPD, already with a uniformed force of about 35,000 - by far the nation's largest - should hire one thousand more police officers. Her concerns over crime spikes would prove unfounded: New York City would experience a record low number of murders in 2014, with the murder and overall crime rate remaining exceedingly low in subsequent years.\n\nMelissa Mark-Viverito, the city council speaker at the time, prioritized the demand, and it was backed up by the overwhelmingly Democratic body, from the progressives to the moderates to the few Republicans who always cried out for bigger police budgets.\n\nIt wasn't just crime control on the council members' minds. Some lawmakers saw adding police as a way to cut down on the department's growing overtime budget.\n\nOthers believed adding police could send more officers on foot into communities to establish relationships with residents - a model of \"community policing\" that had been tried in New York before and taken on vague forms in other municipalities, with varying success.\n\nDe Blasio and Bratton actually shot down the request for more cops - initially, at least. The mayor argued it would cost too much money. Bratton agreed, until the idea of swelling his paramilitary grew too alluring. By September 2014, he was boxing de Blasio in by embracing the addition of one thousand police officers.\n\nIn 2015, the City Council returned, newly emboldened, to force de Blasio's hand and hire a thousand more police officers. This time, de Blasio was feeling more pressure to placate police unions, who had been furiously opposed to him ever since he dared to express sorrow for Eric Garner's death and acknowledge the reality of racially biased policing. After the assassination of two officers, Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu, at the end of 2014, police turned their backs en masse on de Blasio at both officers' funerals.\n\n\"In order for NYPD to continue to keep New Yorkers safe while also implementing new reforms and initiatives we need to increase the overall headcount of the department,\" Mark-Viverito, the council speaker, said in April 2015.\n\nThis time, de Blasio caved. Eager to please both the council members and his restive police department, he agreed to the addition of just under 1,300 new police officers, beyond even what the Council asked for.\n\nDe Blasio argued the new officers could be used for a community policing initiative, with designated neighborhood officers to walk the beat and interact with residents. For black and brown New Yorkers who have been harassed by police under both Bloomberg and de Blasio, a bigger department brought little comfort.\n\nThe agreement came in the new city budget, adopted that June. Out of the fifty-one council members, just a single lawmaker, Inez Barron of Brooklyn, voted against the budget , calling the decision to add more police a \"fatal flaw.\"\n\nAmong those who supported the budget were leading progressives like Williams and Brad Lander, now a top candidate for city comptroller and an outspoken supporter of Black Lives Matter, and Corey Johnson, who is the current council speaker and a leading candidate for mayor next year. Johnson has never quite given up his love affair with increasing the NYPD's headcount: in 2018, he said he would try to hire even more police to bolster de Blasio's community policing initiative.\n\nIt's a reminder that Johnson, who is vying for the support of leftist organizations by rejecting real estate money, is not the mayoral candidate to radically restructure the NYPD. But who is? His rival, Brooklyn borough president Eric Adams, is a former police captain who has not supported calls to reduce the NYPD's budget. Another top candidate, city comptroller Scott Stringer, has never publicly committed to slashing police headcount either.\n\nLikely, change will have to come from below, with mass protests pushing city council members to act, either pressuring de Blasio or his successor to do far more. Johnson is now backing a bill to criminalize the type of chokehold maneuver that killed Eric Garner; de Blasio is opposed to the legislation.\n\nIt will be up to the next generation of city council members - term limits arrive next year - to learn from the sins of their predecessors. Long-lasting reform won't come with body cameras or another round of retraining. It certainly won't come from adding police. Demilitarizing the NYPD, shrinking headcount, and increasing the number of social workers and mental health professionals will help begin to turn the tide against police brutality. Nothing else will.\n\nAn earlier version of this article stated that New York City councilman Brad Lander voted for the 2015 budget that increased the size of the New York Police Department. The article has been updated to reflect the fact that Lander, though openly supportive of NYPD expansion, was in fact absent the day of the budget vote.\n\nRoss Barkan is a writer and journalist in New York City.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

To attack inequality and invest in poor and working-class neighborhoods of color, we need a massive increase in public spending. That means wresting resources from the rich.\n\nNew Yorkers hold a rally outside of City Hall in a show of solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement and to demand less funding for the NYPD and more to social well-being programs, on June 24, 2020 in New York City. (Spencer Platt / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nSome protest movements become defined by three- or four-word slogans. The battle cry of Occupy Wall Street was, \"We are the 99 percent.\" The current wave of protests has, \"Defund the Police.\"\n\nSome progressives have suggested that \"transform the police\" would be a better slogan, but that seems exactly wrong. \"Transform\" can mean anything or nothing. \"Defund\" means \"reallocate money from their budgets to other services.\" The only ambiguity is how much money to reallocate.\n\nAs for right-wing critics, we're talking about people who've spent the last decade reinterpreting the phrase, \"black lives matter\" - an obvious expression of outrage at the devaluing of black life in a society that tolerates brutal racial inequality and lets police officers get away with murder - as a statement that nonblack lives don't matter.\n\nThe underlying reasoning behind \"Defund the Police\" is simple: many of the conflict resolution functions currently performed by police officers can be transferred to counselors, social workers, and other public employees whose job descriptions don't involve the use of violence. There's no reason that the cops need to be called because a homeless woman passed out in a hotel lobby or a mentally ill man is having an episode. Slashing the budgets of police departments and boosting the budgets of other services could result in far fewer situations ending in violence.\n\nStill, we should be wary of making the case for \"Defund the Police\" in a way that implicitly accepts the limits imposed on our collective imaginations by decades of neoliberalism. I recently saw one of my favorite members of Congress making exactly that mistake.\n\n\"Defund\" means that Black & Brown communities are asking for the same budget priorities that White communities have already created for themselves: schooling > police,etc.\n\nPeople asked in other ways, but were always told \"No, how do you pay for it?\"\n\nSo they found the line item.\n\n- Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) June 9, 2020\n\nUnfortunately, we could reduce the line item for police departments to zero without achieving these goals. A little back-of-the-napkin math is sobering.\n\nIn Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's hometown, the police budget is $5.9 billion dollars . As of last month, Mayor Bill de Blasio had already called for an $800 million reduction to the schools' funding, and lawmakers were warning that cuts of about another $2 billion were on their way . It would take reallocating well over half of the New York Police Department budget just to head off those cuts.\n\nLet's say that funding was instead hiked by $2 billion - a lot of money in most contexts but a pretty modest boost to the $34 billion pre-cut budget for New York City public schools. (One point of comparison: the spending gulf between the poorest and wealthiest school districts in New York \" now approaches $10,000 \" per pupil.)\n\nSo far we've reallocated $4.8 billion from the $5.9 billion budget, and we haven't even dramatically improved the schools. We also haven't hired a single counselor or social worker outside the education system. We certainly haven't created any job programs or done anything for the sixty thousand homeless men, women, and children sleeping in the city's shelters every night.\n\nThe picture doesn't get any better if we zoom out to the rest of the country. As Eric Levitz notes , the United States as a whole spends $115 billion on policing, while the estimated price tag of providing \"high-quality social housing for all who want it\" is $250 billion. The Bernie Sanders campaign put the annual cost of Bernie's Medicare for All plan at $3.2 trillion.\n\nIndeed, as scholars like John Clegg and Adaner Usmani argue , part of the reason why elites opted for a more violent and aggressive regime of policing and incarceration several decades ago was that it was a cheaper way of managing the social ills caused by poverty than expanding the welfare state.\n\nReallocating funds from the police departments that soak up so much of city budgets is absolutely necessary. But we're making a mistake if we think we've \"found the line item.\" Rearranging the money already in municipal budgets is going to leave most poor and working-class neighborhoods of color still woefully underfunded.\n\nSolving that requires taking on the entrenched power of the 1 percent. We're going to have to soak the rich.\n\nBen Burgis is a philosophy professor and the author of Give Them An Argument: Logic for the Left .

A new report proves me right.\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nPolicing done right is hard, honorable work. And maintaining confidence in the police as a fair-minded, apolitical institution that enforces the law in an impartial way is all about staying calm when emotions are high.\n\nThat was the bottom line of last week's 41-page report by New York City's admirably independent Department of Investigation, which last year tore into an unprecedented torrent of antagonistic tweets by top NYPD brass targeting elected officials, judges, and even the occasional journalist. The report found the barrage \"irresponsible,\" \"unprofessional\" and \"intimidating.\" The DOI even questioned whether some posts violated the federal Hatch Act barring political activity by public officials.\n\nThe NYPD leaders who spent the first few months of 2024 publicly attacking their perceived enemies online piped down as the department weathered raid after raid after raid by the FBI. The department churned through three commissioners while Mayor Eric Adams , an ex-cop now facing a criminal trial on corruption charges, cheered on his police officials as they lashed out.\n\nThere's a big problem if police with shields, cuffs, guns and the authority to use them and their bosses are as free to mouth off as the people armed only with pens and keyboards.\n\nChief John Chell, who's since been promoted to become the department's top uniformed official , challenged a woman who'd asked tough questions to Mayor Adams to come find him at the funeral of a murdered police officer. He attacked a judge for the release of a violent criminal on bail but named the wrong judge. And repeatedly called on voters to cast out a socialist city council member as the two exchanged crude insults.\n\nI was the subject of some of the attacks, labeled in a tweet on the official @nypdnews account as \"Harry 'Deceitful' Siegel,\" and smeared by various bosses there for \"hating cops\" as they vowed to no longer \"allow disingenuous and outright false reporting to be spewed unabated.\"\n\n\"We are the police, and you are a gadfly,\" sneered a deputy commissioner on his official account.\n\nI welcome criticism and often learn from it. I always take pains to get the facts right and correct them when I don't. As for remarks like these, I defer to DOI Commissioner Jocelyn Strauber, who dryly stated, \"No aspect of the social media exchanges that DOI reviewed in this investigation served the public.\"\n\nAdams thought differently.\n\n\"I don't think they attacked anyone,\" he said last April. \"If a columnist has a right to an opinion,\" he added, \"a police officer has the right to an opinion,\" as if the chiefs and commissioners talking trash from their official city accounts were ordinary officers doing so while walking a beat.\n\nThere's a big problem if police with shields, cuffs, guns and the authority to use them and their bosses are as free to mouth off as the people armed only with pens and keyboards.\n\nThere are just three institutions remaining in America that most people have confidence in, according to Gallup : The military, small businesses and the police, which just barely clear 50%. (Newspapers are at just 18% - another reason why Adams may not want to equate his police chiefs with ink-stained wretches.)\n\nEach time a top cop replaces just-the-facts-ma'am \"courtesy, professionalism and respect\" with smack talk, it eats away at what remains of that hard-earned public confidence.\n\nIt would be nice to think that the mayor once knew better.\n\nThe NYPD \"is good at laying traps, executing traps. And even if the trap doesn't capture the prey, they would shoot the prey anyway,\" Adams said years ago, laughing, while reminiscing about his own two decades wearing the uniform.\n\n\"The police department doesn't have rules. They are the rules,\" the mayor said.\n\nNew NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch, who Adams brought on in November to clean up the mess that he'd made of the department he once served, has been moving with force and speed to restore the NYPD's chain of command - and public confidence in its works. But the two leading X trolls who the city's own Department of Investigation just called to account are still there, just keeping quiet for now.\n\nTo spell out the embarrassingly obvious, what's at stake in America's biggest city is the very idea of a fair-minded police department that's above politics, maintaining the trust needed to protect and serve the public. It's a sign of how much cleaning up remains to be done by Tisch, and how much resistance Adams may pose to that work, that this has to be stated.\n\nHarry Siegel is a senior editor at the newsroom The City , a columnist for the New York Daily News and the producer and a co-host of the \" FAQ NYC \" podcast.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

One of the officers takes out a Taser and keeps the bystanders at bay while two other officers struggle with the man in between two parked vehicles. At one point, the man appears to swing at one of the officers.\n\nA New York Police Department spokesperson said that at about 9:34 p.m. on July 4, officers tried to stop a person from lighting fireworks and pointing them at apartment windows. According to police, the person fled and a 27-year-old man whom they identified as Shaquan Davis prevented police from pursuing the person by stepping in their path and pushing an officer. When the officer attempted to arrest Davis, police allege, he resisted arrest by \"pushing, shoving, wrestling, flailing his arms and punching the officer.\"\n\nDavis, who lives in Brooklyn, was arrested on charges of assault of a police officer, resisting arrest, obstructing governmental administration, assault with intent to cause physical injury, disorderly conduct and harassment. He is due in court on Oct. 7. His attorney, Jonathan Fink, said Davis was released on his own recognizance and denies any wrongdoing. His position is that he was assaulted by police, Fink said.\n\nA spokesperson for Adams referred NBC News to remarks he made on a radio show Wednesday morning.\n\nWhen asked about the video by radio host Tarsha \"Miss Jones\" Jones of 94.7 The Block's \"Jonesy in the Morning,\" Adams said he had seen it and that Police Commissioner Edward Caban had \"immediately placed\" the officers on a modified assignment. A modified assignment typically means an officer has been stripped of their firearm and assigned to a nonenforcement role.\n\n\"They're going to do a thorough investigation and find out what happened,\" Adams said. \"Everyone must be held accountable, because when you have the power and authority to take away someone's freedom, there's a lot of obligation and oversight that should come with that, and I have a lot of faith in Commissioner Caban because he came up through the ranks, and his dad was a strong advocate for diversity in the Police Department.\"\n\nHe added: \"We're going to look into this, and it's going to be investigated appropriately, and if those officers are found to have done something improper, they're going to be held accountable. We do not play the game. We're going to support our police, but our police must support the people that they are policing.\"\n\nJones asked him why, if police knew they were being recorded by bystanders, they felt \"so comfortable\" and \"so empowered\" to act as they did.\n\n\"That's a great question, and I think it's a combination of things. Adrenaline is real, people are caught up in the adrenaline, and that's what we're constantly trying to train people that you've got to take a step back,\" Adams said. \"You get caught up in the emotion of policing and you start just reacting and not thinking and you make those errors and mistakes.\"\n\nThe police department also faced criticism this week over a five-second video posted to X by a city councilman on Tuesday that showed an officer punching a man in the face while his hands were behind him and apparently restrained.\n\nThat video was recorded in Brooklyn. A police spokesperson said a man was stopped \"in regard to an amplified sound from a portable speaker\" at approximately 3:42 a.m. Friday. He was warned multiple times to turn off the speaker and did not comply, according to police. When officers confiscated the speaker, he became disorderly, stepped in front of them and attempted to grab it from them, police said. According to police, officers gave him multiple warnings to remain on the sidewalk and to stop interfering with police, and when they tried to arrest him, he resisted. The man in the video, Lamark Wyche, 44, of Brooklyn, was arrested on charges of obstructing governmental administration and unreasonable noise, which Wyche said have been dropped. His attorney did not immediately return requests for comment.\n\nThe NYPD did not identify the officers in either video.\n\n\"Residents and community leaders in Coney have worked very hard over many years to build up trust and respect between the cops and the community,\" said Justin Brannan, the councilman who shared the video on X. \"Our community is pro-public safety. Punching people in the face when their hands are behind their backs isn't public safety and being anti-police brutality doesn't mean you are anti-cop. Incidents like this have a ripple effect and set everything back.\"\n\nA City Hall spokesperson said: \"We hold the men and women of the NYPD to the highest standards, and we are reviewing the incident.\"\n\nI am a national reporter for NBC News Digital.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

Bickford used a machete-style knife and said \"Allahu Akbar,\" which means \"God is great\" in Arabic, as he slashed at their heads, prosecutors said.\n\nThe prosecutor's office called it a premeditated \"violent rampage.\" Before Bickford traveled from Maine to the world-famous Times Square New Year's Eve event to attack police, he immersed himself in the teachings of the Taliban and considered going overseas to support the Islamic extremist group, the U.S. attorney's office said.\n\n\"Inspired by radical Islamic extremism, Trevor Bickford brutally attacked three NYPD officers who were just doing their jobs by protecting the public during the Times Square New Year's Eve festivities,\" U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement .\n\nBickford pleaded guilty in January to three counts of attempted murder of officers and employees of the U.S. government and persons assisting them.\n\nHe has also been indicted on state counts of first-degree attempted murder in furtherance of an act of terrorism, first-degree attempted murder and other offenses.\n\nThe state case is pending. His next court date is May 22, online records show.\n\nBickford attacked the first officer, who was 23 years old at the time, at around 10:10 p.m., striking him from behind with the knife, and then attacked the two others, officials have said. The first officer he attacked suffered a fractured skull.\n\nThe three injured officers spoke in the Manhattan federal courtroom Thursday, including Officer Mickel Hanna, who shot Bickford once in the shoulder and ended the rampage, NBC New York reported . Hanna said that had he not fired, \"people could have died that night,\" and that he no longer likes being in crowds, the station reported.\n\nBickford said \"I've left scars\" and \"I hope the victims can forgive me,\" according to NBC New York.\n\nBickford's defense attorneys argued that untreated mental illness played a significant role in the attack and that \"Mr. Bickford is ashamed and appalled by his actions in trying to kill three police officers.\"\n\nBickford was having \"auditory, tactile, and visual hallucinations,\" they wrote in a sentencing memorandum in which they asked for 10 years in prison.\n\nBickford wrote in a letter to the judge that he owed an apology to the officers and everyone who witnessed the attack, and well as the United States of America. He said that hallucinations caused him to go deeper into radical Islam, adding, \"By the time I attacked the officers, I had become someone else.\"\n\n\"I wish that I could take back my actions. I'm grateful for the officers' quick thinking and actions to make sure I didn't hurt anyone else that night,\" he wrote.\n\nProsecutors asked for at least 50 years in prison, arguing that when it comes to terrorist attacks, \"the need for deterrence is also of critical importance here.\" Sentencing guidelines allowed for 120 years, they noted.\n\n\"The defendant plotted to kill those who did not subscribe to the extremist strain of Islam he embraced,\" prosecutors wrote in their sentencing submission. \"His goal was to kill as many military-aged men who worked for the U.S. Government as he could.\"\n\nI am a breaking news reporter working nights in Los Angeles.

Diller was fatally shot Monday in Far Rockaway, Queens after he and his partner approached a vehicle that was illegally parked at a bus stop. The suspect inside the vehicle shot Diller below his bullet-proof vest, Police Commissioner Edward Caban said, according to The Associated Press .\n\nReached for comment, Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump is \"moved by the invitation to join\"  Diller's family and his colleagues \"as they deal with his senseless and tragic death.\"\n\nTrump's expected attendance at Diller's wake comes as he continues to make baseless claims about the crime rate in New York. The former president has often made such claims while attacking state prosecutors who have brought charges against him, including New York Attorney General Letitia James and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. James brought the civil fraud case against him and Bragg brought charges of falsifying business records against him in his hush money case .\n\nThe former president has also alluded to New York police officers who were assaulted this year by a group of migrants.\n\n\"You know, in New York, what's happening with crime is it's through the roof, and it's called 'migrant,'\" the former president said at a rally in Michigan last month. \"They beat up police officers. You've seen that they go in, they stab people, hurt people, shoot people.

      "text": "Eric Adams vs. the NYPD\n\nMayor Eric Adams provides New Yorkers with the best chance in well over 50 years to make real changes to the ways the New York Police Department operates, both on the streets and in its disciplinary processes. He has ample plans , but does he have the will?\n\nThe city's mayors have frequently vowed to reform policing, but usually failed to secure many accomplishments. Most recently, Bill de Blasio came into office in 2014 committed to rolling back the aggressive policing that Michael Bloomberg had championed, especially the zealous use of stop and frisk.\n\nHowever, by the end of de Blasio's first year in office, the NYPD's rank-and-file had turned on him, figuratively and literally, with thousands showing him their backs at the funerals for two murdered officers. Pat Lynch, president of the officers' union, the Police Benevolent Association, accused de Blasio of contributing to their deaths by supporting protests against the police killings of Eric Garner on Staten Island and Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.\n\nA daily email update of the stories you need to read right now.\n\nAdams is the first mayor since 1950 who is a former police officer. He has positioned himself as the ultimate insider, a policeman whose origin story begins with a cruel station house beating , which led him to want to change the department's racist, violent culture from within. Adams' experience, while shocking, was not uncommon. As I illustrate in my new book , The Harlem Uprising: Segregation and Inequality in Postwar New York City , the NYPD has a long history of indiscriminate violence, particularly against men of color.\n\nAdams did this work in a very public way for over a decade, criticizing Mayors Rudy Giuliani and Bloomberg and the PBA, as well as conducting workshops on how young Black men should behave during encounters with NYPD officers. While Brooklyn Borough president, he even came to de Blasio's defense during the 2014 controversy and has remained steadfast in his assessment that the police treat Black and brown people as suspects by default.\n\nDespite this, the PBA viewed candidate Adams as an acceptable choice during the Democratic primary season. The PBA represents 24,000 of the city's 35,000 uniformed police officers. It is politically powerful and has been since the 1960s, when it organized and won a referendum permanently removing civilians from any role overseeing the police in any way.\n\nSince then, the PBA has gone to war with many mayors, including Giuliani and Bloomberg , and has been utterly unwilling to tolerate criticism, reform, and above all any measure of increased accountability. In the mid-1990s, it was lobbying Albany to pass a bill removing the police commissioner's ability to fire officers.\n\nPat Lynch and his leadership team-still overwhelmingly white and male even though the force is less than half white and about 20 percent female -are determined combatants who know how to fight and win. They've been doing it for decades.\n\nAdams' only experience with the PBA seems to be as foe. He began his career with the New York City Transit Police, which had its own unions. By the time Giuliani merged the transit and housing police into the NYPD in 1995, Adams was a sergeant, represented by the Sergeants Benevolent Association, a union also fond of controversy .\n\nAppointing reformers at the highest ranks is no easy fix. The rank-and-file are quick to turn on departmental leaders they feel are not supporting them 100 percent, a dynamic that has endured for decades. Commissioners and their chosen executives run the department in name, but the PBA and SBA significantly constrain their abilities.\n\nThe PBA has several tactics it deploys to great effect. It has an enormous amount of money it eagerly spends on lobbying, political donations, and attack ads. Another is Lynch himself, unafraid to engage in dire hyperbole, often menacing the public with the specter of a lawless tomorrow should policing change in any way. Finally, it wields the threat of a work slowdown, a promise it has fulfilled several times, designed to coerce city leaders into compliance.\n\nThe steps Adams will need to take, such as shifting the burden of civil financial judgments to individual officers who violate people's rights, will elicit rancorous conflict and bitter invective. But does anyone really think taxpayers should be spending hundreds of millions of dollars a year to settle suits against violent, lawless officers who are rarely disciplined, let alone fired ? The mayor must decide what matters and what he is willing to do to provide effective and ethical policing, which he insists are not mutually exclusive goals .\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "We Don't Need the NYPD to Apologize for Stonewall\n\nThis post is part of Outward , Slate's home for coverage of LGBTQ life, thought, and culture Read more here .\n\nOn Thursday, NYPD commissioner James P. O'Neill apologized for the force's harassment of LGBTQ people that led to the Stonewall riots of 1969. Amid pressure from gay New York City Council speaker Corey Johnson, who pointed out in a Wednesday radio interview that the NYPD had apologized for other past offenses, O'Neill issued his statement at a Pride month safety briefing. \"I think it would be irresponsible to go through World Pride month and not to speak of the events at the Stonewall Inn in June of 1969,\" he said, referencing the international Pride festival coming to New  York in the second half of June. \"I do know what happened should not have happened. The actions taken by the NYPD were wrong, plain and simple.\"\n\n\"The actions and the laws were discriminatory and oppressive, and for that, I apologize,\" he continued. \"I vow to the LGBTQ community that this would never happen in the NYPD in 2019.\"\n\nThe Stonewall uprising, a major inflection point in the modern LGBTQ rights movement, marks its 50 th anniversary this year. On June 28, 1969, NYPD officers raided the Manhattan gay bar and frisked, assaulted, and arrested patrons, as was customary at the time. Hundreds of LGBTQ people arrived on the scene to fight back in protests and acts of physical resistance that lasted days. The riots became a galvanizing moment for gay and trans people who were sick of being expected to accept police harassment as the price of being queer or gender nonconforming in public, and they are the event that the Pride marches were originally organized to commemorate.\n\nIn recent years, O'Neill and his predecessor, Bill Bratton, have refused to apologize for the NYPD's history of violence against LGBTQ people. When asked in June 2017 if he would \"apologize for the discrimination and violence\" the NYPD perpetrated during the clash at the Stonewall Inn, O'Neill said , \"I think that's been addressed already. ... We're moving forward.\" A year earlier, Bratton said of such an apology, \"I don't think that's necessary. The apology is all that's occurred since then.\" The \"terrible experience\" queer and trans people suffered at Stonewall ultimately begat \"so much good,\" he said.\n\nO'Neill was reportedly met with applause when he reversed his stance on Thursday. But it's hard to pinpoint exactly what his belated contrition will accomplish. The apology will certainly benefit the NYPD, which will enjoy a bump of Pride month goodwill from certain  quarters. As for LGBTQ people, however, it's unclear what a verbal apology for 50-year-old acts of homo- and transphobic violence is supposed to prove. The lesson of Stonewall is not \"do not raid Mafia-run gay bars,\" which is not really a pressing queer-or cop!-concern in 2019. It's \"do not systemically target, harass, and criminalize LGBTQ and otherwise marginalized communities.\"\n\nThat's a lesson the NYPD does not seem to have learned. It took activists years-until this very month-to successfully pressure the department into amending its enforcement of a section of the penal code that criminalizes loitering that may be related to sex work. Officers have been profiling trans women as sex workers under the law, using their clothing and other elements of gender presentation as justification for their arrests. This is just one example of the ways the NYPD, like law enforcement bodies around the country , continues to terrorize and punish LGBTQ people for their identities. Stonewall wasn't remarkable because of the way the cops on the scene behaved-their physical and verbal abuse were, by all accounts, routine. The riots became historically important because of what the targets of the NYPD's harassment did in response. To apologize for just this one act out of the NYPD's many, ongoing acts of LGBTQ criminalization is to miss Stonewall's entire point.\n\nAt this moment in LGBTQ history, activists are mobilizing in increasing numbers to create their own police-free Pride events and get uniformed police officers out of mainstream Pride celebrations. This movement recognizes the fact that, for many LGBTQ people, law enforcement bodies do not protect from, but rather perpetrate, discrimination and violence.\n\nApologizing for beating queer and trans people, arresting them for wearing the clothes of their choosing, and subjecting them to organized harassment in 1969 is not taking a stance for LGBTQ dignity in 2019. It's an empty gesture performed far too late to make any meaningful statement on Stonewall, and a slick distraction from the ongoing state violence being perpetrated against LGBTQ people living today.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Well, That's One Way for the NYPD to Commemorate Their University Raids\n\nPolice swarmed university campuses this week, arresting more than 2,300 students who were involved in protests over U.S. involvement in Israel's war in Gaza. But as far as we can tell, only one police unit released a 4-minute-and-30-second cinematic ode to their own heroic efforts.\n\nThat would be the New York Police Department, which capitalized on its messy interventions at Columbia University and City College to capture source material for a weird video game-looking sizzle reel that they posted on May 1, one day after the raids.\n\nthe NYPD just posted a highly edited propaganda video, complete with an over-the-top dramatic cinematic score, about their raid on Columbia last night it has to be seen to be believed pic.twitter.com/n1emegDvVY\n\nBilled as an \"inside look\" into how the force \"restored order\" at the two educational institutions, the video opens with a montage of officers gathered in a conference room, watching a video monitor of a protester standing on the rooftop of Columbia University's Hamilton Hall. This on-campus building is where student protestors barricaded themselves last week in an echo of the Columbia students who occupied the same space in protest in 1968. (Those strikes were about racism and the Vietnam War; a later 1985 strike that included an occupation of Hamilton Hall was about getting the school to divest from South Africa over apartheid.)\n\nA dramatic musical score-like something out of a Marvel movie-plays loudly over clips of officers entering the windows of the garrisoned building, climbing on their laddered megatruck , and breaking the locks to the doors. One officer finds himself standing-dramatically!-in a room with a bunch of sleeping bags on the floor. Other shots show piles of snack wrappers from where protestors were stationed, and piles of chairs that had been used to obstruct doors.\n\nToward the end of the video, Chief of Patrol John Chell praises the police force as they stand by rows of empty tents on the quad, saying the sweep was \"just a remarkable plan and execution by the NYPD.\"\n\nDeputy Commissioner Tarik Sheppard, who is standing beside Chell, delivers an emphatic message to the camera: \"This is not a tent city. This is New York City.\" He gestures to the former encampment, and adds: \"If you're thinking of doing something like this, take a look around. See how fast we cleared it out.\"\n\nAnother official says the tent area is smelly. \"No student should have to endure this,\" he says, incredibly seriously.\n\nPolitically, one can understand why this is an attractive narrative. It obscures the far bleaker reality: President of Columbia University Minouche Shafik called NYPD officials to clear out the protesters from her own (private) campus, maintaining that the intervention of law enforcement at the school was necessary to counter \"outside agitators\"-alleged bad actors hijacking the movement from the poor students.\n\nThat students were under some sort of sinister outside influence remains completely unproven. What has become clear is that the police accidentally discharged a firearm in Hamilton Hall-and they definitely left that out of the video!\n\nAt City College, the same night, police roughed up peaceful protesters-shoved, kettled, chased, and pepper-sprayed them-and then proceeded to pursue stiffer legal penalties for those public-school protesters than their private-school counterparts.\n\nBetween the raids of Columbia and City College of New York, there were approximately 300 arrests, including of professors, community members, and unaffiliated protesters.\n\nThat there were other people besides students protesting is real . It's not unusual for nationalized coverage of a protest to attract more protesters. But police officials and campus leadership have dug in on blaming anonymous third-party actors because it offers them a clear deflection from the material demands of the students.\n\nThe morning after the raids, for example, Sheppard went on MSNBC's Morning Joe to make that argument and brought a prop-a bike lock, multiple of which were reportedly used by protestors to seal Hamilton Hall. Sheppard claimed the lock was a much more serious tool than students could use, one that had been clearly brought in by outside professionals. \"This is not what students bring to school,\" Sheppard said. \"These are heavy industrial chains.\"\n\nThe nefarious lock, common among New York City cyclists, is so ubiquitous that it has even been offered at the Columbia University store .\n\nDeputy Commissioner Tarik Sheppard shows the chains used to secure Hamilton Hall at Columbia University. \"This is not what students bring to school. This is what professionals bring to campuses and universities.\" pic.twitter.com/fwFUPZlIj7\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams, a former police officer, went a step further in a recent press conference, telling reporters that the demonstrations were a \"global problem\" while warning of some mind-altering conspiracy : \"Young people are being influenced by those who are professional at radicalizing our children.\"\n\nThe release of the NYPD video montage was the cherry on top in terms of PR moves. Because the tragedies of Kent State and Jackson State are not so distant in American history, the police sort of have to make the enemy look far more dangerous than angry crowds of students.\n\nTo that point, Adams lamented that a Palestinian flag had been raised by some of the protesters at City College, saying, \"It's despicable that schools would allow another country's flag to fly in our country.\" After protestors were evacuated, NYPD officials filmed themselves raising an American one in some bizarre WWII-style cosplay. Strangely, that one didn't make the video-montage cut.\n\nThey must be saving that energy for their sequels, which include a recent spinoff where the NYPD looks for the mastermind behind stacks of water at the NYU encampment.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "NYPD Has Been Quietly Revamping How It Treats Crime Victims. The Results Are Impressive.\n\nFor years after 9/11, when victims' families trudged to New York Police Department headquarters to collect whatever belongings of their lost loved ones had been found, police offered the courtesy of ushering them to private rooms for these highly charged moments. Eventually, it dawned on the police that the same dynamics apply to families of all murder victims. When they show up at any police property room to retrieve a package containing a victim's clothing and other possessions, says Susan Herman, a deputy NYPD commissioner, \"Everybody wants to look at it before they walk out, but they shouldn't have to do it in front of lots of strangers in a noisy space.\" Thanks to that insight, NYPD now routinely reserves quiet, private places for grieving families to \"take a moment and be by themselves,\" as Herman puts it.\n\nFor a gargantuan agency that in a year's time comes in contact with millions of distraught people, it's a tiny gesture. But when dozens of such innovations get strung end to end, as NYPD has laid out on Thursday in a wide-ranging report on its efforts to improve how it eases crime victims' burden, the cumulative effect adds up to a much grander proposition: that the marriage of modern policing and crime-victim services is more than an accidental byproduct of victims' calls for help, but in fact can help make a city safer.\n\nThree years ago, I took a detailed look at this theory of policing and Herman's unusual role in it as it began. NYPD's commissioner at the time, Bill Bratton, had recruited Herman out of academia and a long career in victim advocacy to head a new Office of Collaborative Policing. Her mission: to make nice with citizens and advocacy groups and repair the breach of trust between police and residents. This was Bratton 2.0. The crime fighter credited with wrestling rampant violence to the ground, often by using racially fraught tactics, now sought to fix what broken windows policing had broken . If those most at risk of crime trust the police more, so the thinking goes, then more crimes get solved, or better yet prevented.\n\nIn Herman, Bratton had chosen not just any victims' advocate, but one who argued that for all the gains won by the victims' rights movement, America has largely failed to make good on its promises to give victims true justice. There's convincing evidence on her side, starting with the plain fact that huge numbers of even violent-crime victims nationwide don't trust the police enough to report their crimes. And the vast majority of victims who do go to the police receive none of the services set up to help them-often because they don't even know about them .\n\nAnd so, once installed at 1 Police Plaza in 2014, Herman set about the task of scrutinizing NYPD's everyday functions and asking, she says, \"If you interact with victims at all, how could you make their experience better? How do you change your practices to become more efficient, more accessible, more understandable, and less burdensome to victims?\"\n\nThe results, nearly five years into her tenure, range from simple tweaks, like the changes in property-retrieval protocols, to far more elaborate initiatives. The department now uses smartphones and other digital technology to streamline the blizzard of paperwork and interviews that victims endure. Four-foot-by-eight-foot privacy screens and waterproof sheets now block the view of bodies and blood at crime scenes. Homicide detectives now must provide regular updates on investigations to designated family contacts. Officers on patrol now can conference in sign-language interpreters via video links to communicate with the deaf. Child trauma response teams now reach out within 24 hours to young witnesses of domestic violence. Many of the initiatives carry no cost, but the centerpiece program-placing two victim advocates in all 86 police precincts and public housing police units to give immediate care to victims-costs the city $15 million annually. The list of 101 initiatives is infused with trauma-informed practices, a raft of changes in police training, and an overriding goal to connect more victims with available counseling and reimbursement for funerals, medical costs, lost wages, and other disruptions in their lives.\n\n\"This is an amazing step forward,\" says Heather Warnken, a visiting fellow at the U.S. Department of Justice who analyzes crime-victim policy and research. Warnken crunched national policing data earlier this year to conclude that a large majority of police departments fail to connect victims into the multibillion-dollar network of support services established  under the Victims of Crime Act. The new NYPD report shows a commitment that \"really sets them apart from the majority of agencies around the country,\" she says.\n\nFor its sheer scale, NYPD's effort stands out, but it's not alone, Warnken says. She points to a long-standing, federally funded program at the International Association of Chiefs of Police to improve law enforcement-based victim services. Progress in that program's rollout has been glacial, but Warnken says that's because it is strict about using evidence-based methods to measure results and set policy.\n\nOn that score, NYPD has a long way to go. Because its collection of victim-services improvements is so varied in substance and timing, there's no practical way to measure the effectiveness of the program in isolation. The department does survey crime victims about their interactions with police, but that effort mainly gives feedback on individual officers. An ambitious system to track public sentiment about NYPD is still in development. The department will commission a formal assessment of its showcase program, the precinct-based victim advocates, but that too is a ways off. For now, there's no real way to connect the dots on whether all this effort improves the public's trust in NYPD and then whether that in itself causes crime reductions, especially at a time when so many other factors contribute to giving New York bragging rights as the nation's safest big city .\n\nEven if Herman's innovations achieve their ultimate goals, NYPD faces other critical challenges. No. 80 on Herman's list describes how outside victim advocates act as a check on the quality of rape investigations, but the department's Special Victims Division remains in turmoil over findings that its understaffing neglects victims. Other points of friction exist in marijuana enforcement , gang monitoring , anti-violence strategies , and accountability for police brutality . Then there's the reality that Herman and NYPD aren't about to address one of the biggest barriers to helping victims: the linking of most victim aid to the functions of police and prosecutors, effectively leaving most victims-those that do not report their crimes or whose reports never result in prosecution-in the cold.\n\nThis is not to say that repairing trust as a crime-reduction strategy is failing. A solid body of research says it's critical to success in policing. For now, though, New York's efforts are a work in progress. But NYPD's victim-services initiatives can at least take credit for a simpler virtue: treating victims better for its own sake. In the coming days, NYPD, with help from the federal Bureau of Justice Assistance, will ship bound copies of its report throughout the criminal justice community, including to about 100 big-city police departments. The list of innovations represents a grab bag of ideas. If simple human compassion can be the goal of a police department with 55,000 sworn officers and civilians-dwarfing all other cities' departments, and larger even than all but four states' combined law enforcement forces-then maybe others will decide they too can make the effort to give that a try.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "We Need to Cool Down About Police Officers Getting Doused With Water\n\nIn a video posted to Instagram, two soaked New York City police officers trudge away from a group of people, wiping their faces. As they walk past, a young man upends a bucket of water over one officer's head. The officers barely react. \"Oh my God, they laughing at them,\" the woman recording the video says.\n\nPolice department officials and New York lawmakers aren't laughing. State politicians have been in an uproar after multiple videos of civilians spraying traffic cops with a water bottle and dumping buckets of water on officers went viral. In the aftermath of one video that showed officers going about their day after being doused, the New York Police Department's highest-ranking uniformed officer suggested that his colleagues were in the wrong profession because ... they showed restraint? \"Any cop who thinks that's all right, that they can walk away from something like that, maybe should reconsider whether or not this is the profession for them,\" said Terence A. Monahan, the chief of department. \"We don't take that.\"\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo, who took five years to suggest that the officer who killed Eric Garner using an illegal chokehold deserved to be fired , echoed this rhetoric. Cuomo suggested that walking away from the so-called water-bucket attacks made the NYPD look \"impotent\" and called the cops' behavior \"one of the most disturbing and embarrassing actions I've seen.\" The Sergeants Benevolent Association shared one video , proclaiming \"NYPD Cops are in DANGER!\" and claimed , without citing any evidence, that water buckets \"can contain ACID, BLEACH or other CHEMICALS.\" The SBA has said the water dousings warrant the resignation of NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill \"before we get another cop killed.\"\n\nThe fact that higher-ups view officers who do their jobs with restraint not as examples but embarrassments speaks volumes. Officers who choose to walk away are conducting themselves much better than those who lose their cool when they're not shown deference. Overreacting has led officers to hurt the people they're meant to protect, from ramming a police car into a bicyclist who ignored a traffic signal to putting Garner in a chokehold for selling loose cigarettes. Good policing, especially in communities where trust in police has been steadily eroded, requires dealing with the occasional indignity. De-escalatory policing, which instructs officers to avoid using force as much as possible, is widely recognized to be an effective way to defuse tense situations and build trust.\n\nSome politicians are charging ahead with the opposite approach. Citing a \"culture of blatant disrespect,\" two Republican lawmakers have proposed a new bill in the New York State Assembly that would classify the crime of dousing an on-duty police officer as a Class E felony, which would carry a minimum of 11⁄2 years behind bars and a possible maximum sentence of four years. Democrats are not backing the legislation , but it's nonetheless become a talking point in right-wing media . To be clear, dousers are not currently getting away scot-free . One Brooklyn man who turned himself in after being caught on camera dousing two cops with a bucket of water was released on $3,500 bail after being charged with obstructing governmental administration, criminal mischief, and criminal tampering. The last charge was for allegedly damaging a $250 police body camera. The proposed law would ratchet up these penalties considerably and attach the lifelong consequences associated with felony convictions to what is in most cases a rude but harmless prank. If a water dousing did turn violent, there are already laws on the books that mandate harsh penalties- two to 15 years in prison -for menacing or assaulting a police officer. There is no need for new legislation here. The laws we already have are more than enough.\n\nThis isn't the first time lawmakers have tried to overcriminalize perceived disrespect for police officers. In 2018, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Protect and Serve Act, which would make it a federal crime to attack a police officer despite the numerous protections that already exist. The Senate version, which was reintroduced in the 2019 legislative session, classified any attack against law enforcement officials as a hate crime, effectively placing a chosen career in the same category as race or gender.\n\nThrowing water on police falls is akin to other embarrassing but mostly innocuous forms of protest, like tossing milkshakes or eggs at politicians. Anti-fascist protesters in the U.K have thrown milkshakes at far-right figures from Nigel Farage to anti-Muslim activist Tommy Robinson. As Eater's Jenny Zhang writes , \"To throw one is nonviolent, but the results are humiliating; press charges against the thrower (which many have), and you look like a fragile and bratty fool.\" Black people in heavily policed communities have to endure their own routine humiliations at the hands of the police, like allegedly being forced to freestyle on demand or being wrongly arrested and handcuffed on the way to work . It should go without saying that no one \"deserves\" to be doused in water for doing their job-and officers who walk away from such a dousing without escalating are doing that job well. It's also worth saying, as we think about which crimes get punished and how that punishment gets meted out, that taxpayers don't deserve to pay $108 million in one year for civil rights settlements over misconduct committed by police officers doing their jobs badly.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "NYPD Suspends Daniel Pantaleo, Officer Involved in Eric Garner's Death\n\nThe New York Police Department has suspended Daniel Pantaleo, the police officer who was accused of placing Eric Garner in a fatal chokehold in 2014, following the recommendation by an administrative judge to fire the officer, according to the department. NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill will now make the final decision about Pantaleo's position in the department.\n\nPantaleo escaped the last chance prosecutors had at pressing criminal charges against him in July, after the Department of Justice ended its civil rights investigation without charges, just a day before the statute of limitations expired. Pantaleo had already dodged state criminal charges in 2014. After the incident, he remained on desk duty at the NYPD, collecting a regular salary and pension benefits. The department has not indicated if it plans to follow the judge's recommendation, but CNN reports that one senior law enforcement official says O'Neill plans to follow the recommendation.\n\n\"Officer Pantaleo has been suspended, effective today, as is the longstanding practice in these matters when the recommendation is termination,\" a NYPD statement said. \"All of New York City understandably seeks closure to this difficult chapter in our City's history. Premature statements or judgments before the process is complete however cannot and will not be made.\"\n\nThe deadly encounter five years ago sparked a wave of protests, with Garner's last words of \"I can't breathe\" serving as a rallying cry against police violence toward unarmed black men. Garner, a 43-year-old father of six, had been standing on a Staten Island sidewalk when he was approached by police. The officers, who accused him of selling loose cigarettes, attempted to handcuff him, and when he refused, Pantaleo appeared to put Garner in a chokehold. Other officers pushed Garner to the ground, and Garner could be heard in the video telling the officers that he couldn't breathe. A medical examiner testified later that the pressure from the restraint triggered a fatal asthma attack.\n\nWhile criminal charges never materialized, an internal department investigation found Pantaleo had acted dangerously. The administrative judge, NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Trials Rosemarie Maldonado, concluded that Pantaleo had used a chokehold, not the \"seat belt\" technique Pantaleo's lawyers had argued he used, and that he had violated several department policies. Pantaleo's lawyers will now have two weeks to submit responses to O'Neill before the commissioner makes a final decision, according to the Associated Press .\n\nGarner's family, who have spent years pushing for Pantaleo to be held accountable for the death, called on the police department to fire the officer. \"We've waited five years,\" Emerald Garner, Eric Garner's daughter, said in a press conference Friday in reaction to the news. \"Commissioner O'Neill, fire Pantaleo.\"\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

However, murders on the subway doubled, with 10 in 2024 compared to five in 2023, and shootings and petit larceny also increased year-over-year, according to the data.\n\nTisch called the overall transit crime drop \"significant\" but more needs to be done to address the perception of safety in the subway system after the \"terrifying acts of random violence we have seen recently.\"\n\n\"I want to be very clear, the subways will always be a bellwether for the perception of public safety in New York City. Declining crime numbers are significant, but we still must do more, because people don't feel safe in our subways,\" Tisch said during a press briefing on Monday.\n\nThe sentiment was echoed by New York City Mayor Eric Adams.\n\n\"It is clear, perception always overrides reality, and when you look at some of the horrific incidents that the commissioner talked about in these last few days, the average New Yorker would believe that they're living in a city that is out of control. That is not the reality,\" Adams said. \"We know that we are doing a good job in fighting crime, as the numbers will show, but we must deal with the perception that many New Yorkers feel.\"\n\nOne such horrifying incident included the killing of a 57-year-old woman who was set on fire last month on a subway train in Brooklyn. The victim, Debrina Kawam, was sleeping when she was set ablaze, police said. An undocumented Guatemalan citizen has been charged with first-degree murder.\n\nIn another, a man was critically injured last week after an assailant pushed him onto the subway tracks in front of a train in Manhattan in a random attack, police said. The suspect in that case was charged with attempted murder.\n\n\"Nothing is more horrific than watching a person burned to death on our subway system. We know how individuals feel when they're shoved to the tracks for no reason at all. We know how it impacts us,\" Adams said Monday.\n\nThe latest crime data was announced a day after New York City's congestion pricing plan went into effect. Under the new toll system, the first such program of its kind in the country, drivers will pay $9 to access the center of Manhattan during peak hours as part of an effort to ease congestion and raise funds for the city's transit system.\n\nAmong measures to address subway safety, Tisch said she has directed to move more than 200 officers onto the trains to do \"specialty train patrols,\" effective this week.\n\n\"I have further directed that we deploy more officers onto subway platforms in the 50 highest crime stations in the city,\" she added. \"It's all part of the strategy to refocus our subway efforts to places where the crime is occurring.\"\n\nShe said more initiatives are in the works.\n\n\"This month, we will roll out substantial additional improvements to our transit deployments to be even more responsive to the terrifying acts of random violence we have seen recently,\" she said. \"I will have more to say about that soon.\"\n\nAdams also said addressing \"severe mental health\" issues will be a focus of the governor's budget to address public transit safety.\n\n\"We know we have to tackle that perception, and it starts with dealing with the real issue -- mental health,\" he said.\n\nLast week, Gov. Kathy Hochul said she plans to launch a $1 billion plan to address mental health care and supportive housing.\n\n\"The recent surge in violent crimes in our public transit system cannot continue -- and we need to tackle this crisis head-on,\" Hochul said in a statement. \"Many of these horrific incidents have involved people with serious untreated mental illness, the result of a failure to get treatment to people who are living on the streets and are disconnected from our mental health care system. We have a duty to protect the public from random acts of violence, and the only fair and compassionate thing to do is to get our fellow New Yorkers the help they need.\"\n\nThe drop in transit crime coincides with an overall 2.9% drop in crime in 2024, including murders and shootings, Tisch said.\n\nThe police commissioner attributed increases in felony assaults to repeat offenders. She called it \"disheartening\" for police officers to be arresting the same people over and over again due to an increase in the number of decline-to-prosecute cases and a decrease in the number of defendants for whom bail is set.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

However, the Department disagrees with the conclusions of the monitor with respect to some of the encounters the team reviewed,\" the NYPD said in a statement provided to ABC News. \"NSTs engage with the public lawfully and constitutionally, and since the implementation of the program they have been instrumental in the reduction of shootings and homicides that the city is experiencing.\"\n\n\"As we have previously shared with the monitor, we have serious concerns with the methodology used here. However, the facts are clear: Before Mayor Adams and NYPD Commissioner Sewell came into office, citywide shootings were up by double digits, but following the creation of the Neighborhood Safety Teams in March 2022, shootings have consistently fallen and were down by double digits last year, and that trend has continued into 2023,\" a spokesperson for Adams told ABC News.\n\nThe mayor's office called stops that were unconstitutional \"unacceptable,\" but said that safety teams have improved training and oversight to make sure that New Yorkers are protected, and their civil liberties are safeguarded.\n\n\"As Mayor Adams always says, the prerequisites to prosperity are public safety and justice,\" his spokesperson said.\n\nAfter analyzing a random sample of stops by Neighborhood Safety Teams in 10 precincts, the monitor found that \"more than 97% of the people encountered were Black or Hispanic,\" with approximately 93% being men, according to the report.\n\nA quarter of the frisks lacked reasonable suspicion and a third of the searches lacked legal basis, according to Denerstein.\n\nOut of 230 car stops, two turned up weapons and another two stops recovered contraband that the monitor team wasn't able to identify, according to the report.\n\n\"First-line supervisors are not identifying and correcting improper stops, frisks and searches, and oversight by the precinct command and the department is similarly lacking,\" the monitor said.\n\nDenerstein praised some commands consistently engaged in constitutional stops, frisks and searches.\n\n\"The fact that some commands have a very high level of compliance makes clear that lawful and effective policing are not incompatible,\" Denerstein wrote. \"Although some commands have 100% compliance, others fall far short of the mark.\"\n\nShortly after a U.S. District Court judge ruled in 2013 the policy violated the Constitution, then-NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg, in an op-ed in the Washington Post, pushed back against claims that stop-and-frisk promoted racial profiling.\n\nBloomberg walked back his support of his signature policy when he ran for president in 2020.\n\n\"I've gotten a lot of grief for it lately, but I defended it for too long,\" Bloomberg said during a campaign stop in Virginia in February 2020. \"And because I didn't fully understand the unintentional pain it caused young Black and brown kids and their families, I should have acted sooner and I should have stopped it, and I didn't, and I apologize for that.\"\n\nThe vast majority of stops, about 97%, that occurred between 2003 and 2022 happened during Bloomberg's time as mayor, according to the New York Civil Liberties Union.\n\n\"While comparatively fewer stops occurred during the de Blasio administration -- nearly 135,000 -- enormous racial disparities have persisted every year,\" the NYCLU said.\n\nLast year, under Mayor Adam's administration, New York City police conducted more than 15,000 stops, according to NYCLU.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

If I am charged, I am innocent and I will fight this with every ounce of my strength and spirit,\" Adams said in a statement on Sept. 25.\n\nCaban and other top city officials have resigned amid the federal probe and some of them also face criminal charges.

Sources told ABC News he was spotted on board in Washington, D.C.\n\nFor the second straight day, NYPD divers entered a lake near Central Park's Bethesda Fountain on Sunday searching for evidence connected to the Midtown homicide. It was unclear if investigators recovered anything from the water.\n\nPolice have not yet recovered the distinctive gun used in the shooting.\n\nThe masked gunman shot Thompson at point-blank range at 6:44 a.m. on Dec. 4 outside the New York Hilton Midtown, where Thompson's company was holding an investors conference. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch described the attack as \"brazen\" and \"targeted.\"\n\nPolice have learned that the suspect took a taxi to the Port Authority bus facility at 178th Street and boarded a bus out of New York City following the shooting, according to police.\n\nThe NYPD believes it is making good progress toward identifying the shooter but has so far not done so, sources told ABC News. Late Saturday, the NYPD released new images of the suspected shooter in what appeared to be the back of a cab. No further context was given.\n\nThe suspect is believed to have boarded a bus out of the city that made six or seven stops, police sources said. Investigators have followed leads in multiple states, the sources said.\n\nThe FBI is assisting the nationwide manhunt, according to law enforcement sources.\n\nInvestigators are continuing to comb New York City -- where the suspect is believed to have spent 10 days before the shooting -- for evidence.\n\nThe NYPD recovered a backpack that allegedly belonged to the suspect on Friday night. The bag had only two items inside -- a Tommy Hilfiger jacket and Monopoly money -- sources with knowledge of the ongoing investigation told ABC News Saturday.\n\nInvestigators believe they secured DNA samples from several pieces of evidence discovered at or near the crime scene, law enforcement sources told ABC News.\n\nThe DNA samples are currently at the NYC Office of the Chief Medical Examiner to be run through databases for a possible match -- a process that could take several days, the sources said.\n\nPolice were also able to extract a fingerprint off a water bottle the suspect bought at a Starbucks. The print is smudged, so it is unclear whether it will be helpful to the investigation, sources said.\n\nThe brazen, targeted shooting unfolded about 6:40 a.m. on Wednesday outside the New York Hilton hotel, where Thompson was to attend his company's shareholder conference. The gunman, whom police said was lying in wait, shot Thompson multiple times from behind as the CEO approached an entrance to the hotel, according to police.\n\n\"The shooter then walks toward the victim and continues to shoot,\" NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said. \"It appears that the gun malfunctions, as he clears the jam and begins to fire again.\"\n\nWritten on the shell casings were the words \"deny,\" \"defend\" and \"depose,\" according to police sources.\n\nThe words on the bullets echo the title of the 2010 book \"Delay, Deny, Defend: Why Insurance Companies Don't Pay Claims and What You Can Do About It.\" Police are aware of the similarity, and are investigating whether one possible motive is anger at the insurance industry, sources said.\n\nCentene, a major health insurer, said it would hold a planned in-person investor day in New York City next week virtually, according to a Friday statement citing Thompson's killing.\n\n\"All of us at Centene are deeply saddened by Brian Thompson's death and want to express our support for all of those affected,\" Centene Chief Executive Officer Sarah M. London said.\n\n\"He was a person with a deep sense of empathy and clear passion for improving access to care,\" London added. \"Our hearts are with his family and his colleagues during this difficult time.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

The search warrant is not believed to be related to any of the corruption investigations currently ensnaring City Hall .\n\nWhat prompted the search so many years after Donlon's departure from government positions is not clear. A spokesman for the FBI in New York would not comment on the search warrant or whether the documents they were looking for were believed to be classified.\n\nDonlon was appointed as Interim Police Commissioner just over a week ago, after the previous commissioner, Edward Caban, resigned amid an investigation by federal authorities. It marked the first high-profile departure from Mayor Eric Adams' administration since the start of four separate federal investigations into Adams' office and the NYPD.\n\nRelated article New York City's police commissioner resigns as investigations swirl around mayor's inner circle\n\nCaban, who had served as commissioner for 13 months, said in a statement at the time: \"The news around recent developments has created a distraction for our department, and I am unwilling to let my attention be on anything other than our important work, or the safety of the men and women of the NYPD.\"\n\nCaban's departure came days after it was reported that investigators with the US Attorney's Office for New York's Southern District had seized his electronic devices and phones. The investigation involves Caban's brother and enforcement around nightclubs in New York City, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN.\n\nSeveral other members of the mayor's staff are being investigated by the US attorneys in the Eastern and Southern Districts in New York.\n\n\"I was as surprised as you to learn of these inquiries and I take them extremely seriously,\" Adams said at a news conference earlier this month.\n\nFabien Levy, spokesperson for Adams, issued a statement Sunday in response to the search warrant. \"As we have repeatedly said, we expect all team members to fully comply with any law enforcement inquiry,\" Levy said.\n\nAdams appointed Donlon as interim NYPD commissioner on September 12 after addressing Caban's resignation.\n\n\"A short time ago, I accepted the resignation of the NYPD Commissioner Edward Caban,\" Adams said at a news conference last week, adding it \"was the best decision at this time.\"\n\n\"I respect his decision and I wish him well,\" Adams said.\n\nAdams then announced he was appointing Donlon: \"To ensure crime keeps going down in our city today, I'm taking immediate action in appointing Tom Donlon as interim police commissioner.\"\n\n\"Tom is an experienced law enforcement professional who has worked at the local, state, federal, and international levels,\" he said.\n\nDonlon is a former intelligence official who served as New York's director of the Office of Homeland Security, ran the FBI's National Threat Center and the FBI and NYPD joint terrorist task force.\n\n\"I am honored and humbled to be named interim-Commissioner of the New York City Police Department, the greatest law enforcement agency in the world,\" Donlon said in a statement at the time.\n\n\"My goals are clear: continue the historic progress decreasing crime and removing illegal guns from our communities, uphold the highest standards of integrity and transparency, and support our dedicated officers who put their lives on the line every day to keep us safe,\" Donlon said.\n\nCNN's Mark Morales, Brynn Gingras and Sabrina Shulman contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "NY attorney general and civil liberties groups reach 'landmark agreement' with NYPD over protest responses during 2020 Black Lives Matter demonstrations\n\nThe New York Attorney General, the Legal Aid Society, and the New York Civil Liberties Union announced what they called a \"landmark agreement\" with the New York Police Department that \"significantly reforms\" the department's policing of protests to protect \"the public and members of the press from excessive use of force,\" according to a news release.\n\nThe joint agreement will allow the NYPD to \"enforce the law while protecting lawful free expression,\" New York Mayor Eric Adams and the police said in a press release, but one of the city's police unions will not join the settlement.\n\nThe agreement, which resolves litigation filed by the groups \"over NYPD's wrongful arrests and excessive use of force against protesters\" during demonstrations over the summer of 2020 in the wake of George Floyd's death , requires the NYPD to \"change how it deploys officers to public demonstrations,\" to better allow the public to exercise their first amendment rights.\n\nIt comes two months after New York agreed to pay more than $13 million to settle a class action lawsuit that accused the NYPD of using unlawful tactics against protesters following Floyd's death at the hand of officers in Minneapolis, according to a proposed settlement filed in federal court in July.\n\nThe agreement reached Tuesday, stemming from lawsuits filed against the city during Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, \"is the result of a collaborative process that seeks to build consensus, balance safety with justice, and protect protesters, bystanders, and law enforcement personnel,\" Adams said in a statement.\n\nBut the Police Benevolent Association, the union for rank-and-file officers, said it is not party to this settlement due to safety concerns, according to a statement from PBA President Patrick Hendry, who noted \"serious concerns about its impact on the safety of police officers and all New Yorkers in future situations involving coordinated violent actions.\"\n\nUnder the terms of the settlement, a new role within the NYPD will be created to oversee all protest-related activities and develop  a tiered response to them.\n\nThe new senior-level role, called the First Amendment activity senior executive, \"will be responsible for overseeing and developing all policies, procedures, and police officer trainings consistent with this agreement,\" according to a press release from all three parties.\n\nThe senior official, who will have the rank of at least deputy chief, will also be required to lead post-protest reports that document how the NYPD responded to a public demonstration, the joint press release said.\n\nThe four-tiered response established as part of the agreement will allow for police to have different presence levels at demonstrations depending upon the \"size, scale, and conditions at a protest,\" according to the press release.\n\nIn the lowest tier, the NYPD can deploy \"qualified protest liaisons from NYPD's Community Affairs Bureau\" to communicate with protesters and help facilitate peaceful protests; at the highest tier, the NYPD can move to disperse protests if approved by the First Amendment activity executive.\n\nPolice are allowed to move to the highest tier if protestors are trying to gain unauthorized entry, physically blocking others' entry into a sensitive location, or if \"individuals are engaged in widespread criminal conduct that cannot be addressed by targeted arrests,\" the joint press release says.\n\nThe settlement also lays out new guidelines for the NYPD's use of force and treatment of journalists. The agreement calls for the NYPD to \"improve its treatment of members of the press,\" including providing access to protests for news coverage and educating officers on the \"established right under the First Amendment to record police activity in public.\"\n\nAn oversight committee that includes officials with the attorney general's office, the NYC Department of Investigation commissioner and representatives from the Legal Aid society will be in charge of the NYPD's implementation of the new reforms over multiple years.\n\nIn outlining the concerns of police officers, Hendry, the union president, cited injuries inflicted by protesters.\n\n\"Nearly 400 NYPD members were injured during the summer 2020 protests, but there has been zero accountability for the agitators who used the protests as cover to assault police officers,\" Hendry said in his statement. \"This settlement does not change that. If anything, it may serve to encourage future violence.\"\n\nProtests during 2020 \"presented many unique challenges for officers, who did their best to protect people's rights to peaceful expression while addressing acts of lawlessness,\" NYPD Commissioner Edward Caban said in a statement. \"Now, the NYPD has re-envisioned its policies for policing protests to deal with these unique scenarios.\"\n\nAt the time of the $13 million settlement in July, the NYPD referred CNN to the city's law department for comment. Stefan Mooklal, the department's deputy chief of staff, said that settlement was in the \"best interests of all parties.\"\n\nCNN's Kristina Sgueglia contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "NYC's new top cop is a technology enthusiast with 2 weeks on the job. Now Jessica Tisch's NYPD hunts for the killer of a CEO\n\nFollow:\n\nA week after taking over the nation's largest police department, Jessica Tisch found herself on Wednesday reassuring New Yorkers that investigators would \"not rest until we identify and apprehend the shooter\" who brazenly gunned down the chief executive of UnitedHealthcare outside a Manhattan hotel.\n\nThe high-profile, high-tech manhunt for the masked shooter who killed the head of one of the country's largest health insurers is the first major hurdle for a new NYPD commissioner long familiar with department culture and a strong proponent of surveillance technology in crime fighting.\n\n\"I want the department to go to the next level - more than just catching bad guys - but how do we use the technology,\" Mayor Eric Adams said during a CNN appearance with Tisch the week before she was sworn in on November 25. \"She's planted the seed for some of the technology we're looking at now.\"\n\nRelated article Smudged fingerprint is latest clue in hunt for gunman who killed UnitedHealthcare CEO\n\nAmong the first clues in the frantic hunt for the assailant who killed UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson were numerous videos and images - from city streets and from a Starbucks store.\n\nThe masked shooter was \"lying in wait\" for Thompson outside the New York Hilton Midtown Wednesday morning, according to Tisch.\n\nWhen Thompson approached the building, a dark-hooded figure with a gray backpack appeared and shot him in the back, surveillance video shows.\n\nThompson stumbled forward before turning to face the assailant and falling. The gunman calmly walked toward the CEO and continued to shoot, video shows.\n\nThompson was pronounced dead less than half an hour after the incident.\n\n\"It's never the kind of attention that you want on New York City,\" Kenneth Corey, a former NYPD chief of department who worked with Tisch in the intelligence bureau, told CNN of her handling of the CEO shooting investigation so early in her tenure as the department's 48th commissioner. \"So her challenge is really managing that.\"\n\nInvestigators told CNN the assailant crossed the street from the hotel, fled through an alleyway, and got on an electric bike before heading north toward Central Park, where he was last seen on video at 6:48 a.m.\n\nVideo from a Starbucks near the hotel showed the assailant buying a bottle of water and two energy bars roughly 30 minutes before the shooting, a senior police official said.\n\nTisch, a 12-year NYPD veteran, led the development and implementation of the Domain Awareness System, which the city described in announcing her appointment as \"the heart of the NYPD's crime fighting and counterterrorism operations.\"\n\nThe system , which brings together information from license plate readers, tens of thousands of closed-circuit television cameras, facial recognition tools and phone call locations to identify people, has been criticized by civil liberties groups .\n\nRelated article A visual timeline of the UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting\n\n\"This case is going to get made on technology, as so many are today, and she knows probably better than anybody what technology the NYPD has available to it because she brought most of it into the department in the first place,\" Corey said.\n\n\"And remember that not all of that technology belongs to the NYPD or belongs to government,\" Corey added. \"It's really being able to leverage that technology and to piece it all together.\"\n\nRelated video New York City councilman on new leads in manhunt\n\nIndeed, investigators tasked with tracing the assailant's steps have been combing through a mountain of surveillance video, and examining evidence he may have left behind throughout the city and at the scene of the shooting. The search includes thousands of police-monitored and private surveillance cameras.\n\nPolice are also developing clues from a burner phone believed to have been dropped by the suspect when he fled the shooting scene. The phone could yield fingerprints, DNA and -- if technicians can unlock it -- other clues to the suspect's identity, investigators said.\n\nAs of Thursday, police were still trying to access the phone, a law enforcement official said.\n\n\"So you're going to stitch together, for starters, a video timeline that starts with the shooting and shows this person fleeing,\" Corey said. \"But they're also going to rewind that and track him.\"\n\nDuring her 12 years at the NYPD, including a stint as deputy commissioner of information and technology - and 17 years overall in city government - Tisch has embraced a high-tech approach to law enforcement. She also oversaw NYPD 911 operations.\n\n\"She spearheaded efforts to use technology to transform the NYPD's fundamental business processes, including how officers are dispatched and respond to 911 calls, take crime reports, investigate, and search for wanted or missing persons,\" the city said in announcing her appointment.\n\nThe mayor's office credited Tisch with providing every member of the force with a smartphone for access to real-time information in the field. She joined the NYPD - as a civilian - as a counterterrorism analyst in 2008 and headed the implementation of the NYPD's body-worn camera program, according to the city. She graduated from Harvard College, Harvard Law School and Harvard Business School.\n\n\"I think we have revolutionized law-enforcement technology. We have given officers access to data where and when they need it: in the field and in real time,\" Tisch told the Harvard Law Bulletin in 2019.\n\nThat high-tech sleuthing has come into play this week as detectives use video and other investigative tools to piece together a timeline of the shooter's movements.\n\nSurveillance video appears to show the suspect leaving the subway at 57th Street before the shooting. A massive search of Central Park occurred after detectives reviewed video of the man believed to be the suspect leaving the park on West 77th Street and no longer wearing a backpack.\n\nAnd an extensive video canvass led police to a hostel on the Upper West Side, a police official told CNN. The NYPD released photos of a smiling man standing at the front desk of the hostel. Police said he is \"wanted for questioning.\" It's unclear when the photos were taken.\n\nInvestigators also have video of the suspect on the Upper West Side carrying what appears to be an electric bicycle battery, the sources said.\n\nFormer NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton - who coauthored an article this week in City Journal , a publication of the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank - praised Tisch's \"impressive and unconventional resume\" as well as her \"legal savvy and business acumen.\"\n\n\"One question she seems especially well-suited to answer is how the NYPD can leverage new force-multiplier technologies-including AI, facial recognition, drones, and risk-assessment tools-to do more with less, given the recent struggles with recruitment and retention,\" the City Journal article said.\n\nTisch also served as commissioner of the city's Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications and, most recently, as head of the Sanitation Department. Tisch's father, James Tisch, is CEO of the Loews Corp.\n\nTisch told the Harvard Business Review that she \"very randomly\" decided to join the NYPD in 2008 after graduating from law school. She thought it would be difficult finding a job during the financial crisis.\n\n\"I can't even imagine what someone like me would do at the Police Department,\" she recalled saying when a friend suggested she work for the NYPD.\n\nShe is the second female commissioner at the nation's oldest police department. On CNN last month, Tisch described herself as \"a person who takes challenges head-on.\"\n\n\"She's not an outsider and I think that's important,\" Corey said. \"And, you know, the old adage is, the only thing that cops hate more than change is the way things are right now. When she sees where change needs to be made, where efficiencies can be gained, she's not going to be deterred.\"\n\nCNN's Karina Tsui, John Miller, Brynn Gingras, Mark Morales, Amanda Musa, Lauren Mascarenhas, Annette Choi and Jason Hanna contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

He has been with the NYPD for 32 years.\n\nCaban is not the only police commissioner to serve for a short term under Adams: Keechant Sewell resigned after 18 months amid a power struggle over her control of the department and City Hall.\n\nAdams appointed Tom Donlon, a former FBI official, as interim NYPD commissioner after addressing Caban's resignation.\n\n\"A short time ago, I accepted the resignation of the NYPD Commissioner Edward Caban,\" Adams said at a news conference Thursday, adding it \"was the best decision at this time.\"\n\n\"I respect his decision and I wish him well,\" Adams said.\n\nDonlon is a former intelligence official who served as New York's director of the Office of Homeland Security, ran the FBI's National Threat Center and the FBI and NYPD joint terrorist task force.\n\n\"I am honored and humbled to be named interim-Commissioner of the New York City Police Department, the greatest law enforcement agency in the world,\" Donlon said in a statement Thursday.\n\n\"My goals are clear: continue the historic progress decreasing crime and removing illegal guns from our communities, uphold the highest standards of integrity and transparency, and support our dedicated officers who put their lives on the line every day to keep us safe,\" Donlon said.\n\nFederal investigators also seized electronic devices from the homes of several top administration officials last week, including First Deputy Mayor Sheena Wright, Deputy Mayor for Public Safety Phil Banks III, Schools Chancellor David Banks and Tim Pearson, a former police inspector who is a special adviser to the mayor.

      "text": "The NYPD has resurrected its controversial anti-crime unit. Success will be determined by avoiding mistakes of the past\n\nIn response to a wave of violence during his first month on the job - capped by a deadly attack on two police officers - New York City Mayor Eric Adams is resurrecting a controversial unit within the NYPD to help stem an increase in shootings, hoping that oversight and training will prevent the unit from the infamy that plagued it in years past.\n\nThe so-called anti-crime unit, which was disbanded in August 2020 following racial justice protests and unrest across the country, will be rebranded Neighborhood Safety Teams and will start patrolling high-crime neighborhoods in the next three weeks.\n\nThe unit and other similarly composed units have been marked by allegations of aggressive tactics and police brutality. High-profile shootings by plainclothes officers undermined the legitimacy and perception of both the unit and the notion of plainclothes policing in New York. But Adams, who made public safety a key part of his campaign for mayor and touted his history as an NYPD captain as evidence he's uniquely suited for tackling crime, said better training and oversight will help the city keep the unit's troubled lineage in its past.\n\nRelated article NYPD colleagues shot during a domestic incident are remembered after second officer dies from his injuries\n\n\"In doing this, we will avoid mistakes of the past,\" Adams said at a press conference announcing a multi-layered plan for fighting crime that also includes investing in community violence prevention and intervention programs. \"These officers will be identifiable as NYPD, they will have body cameras, and they will have enhanced training and oversight.\"\n\nNew York City is not unique: Cities across the country have units of plainclothes officers assigned to high-risk policing efforts, and though their assignments vary by city, they're similar in many ways. They're usually identifiable, unlike undercovers. They're typically in unmarked cars and not responsible for answering 911 calls, are assigned hours and locations depending on crime concerns, and their mandate is guns or other felony enforcement. And in other cities, they're also associated with aggressive policing.\n\n\"I can't imagine not having a group of officers, deputies, detectives that I can pull and use to prevent and combat a problem they may be having in a certain area,\" said Florida's Orange County Sheriff John W. Mina , who also served as Chief of the Orlando Police Department.\n\n\"Here we just had a series of shootings in an area that has been a challenge for years but we were able to divert resources because they're not tied to just answering calls. And it works. It works. They make a lot of good cases, a lot of good arrests. Put a lot of bad people away to help solve the issue.\"\n\nCritics are quick to point to a checkered history of plainclothes officers in New York - including the three high-profile deaths of Amadou Diallo , Sean Bell and Eric Garner - and a reputation for aggressive policing and abuse of power.\n\nThe biggest problem with the anti-crime unit was the civilian complaints they racked up, said Joseph Giacalone, a former NYPD detective sergeant and current professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.\n\nRelated article NYPD officers are no longer protected from civil lawsuits after city council passes police reform legislation\n\n\"You're going after people who've committed violent crimes, and firearms, you're going to get that reaction because you're not going to be right every time you jump out of the car,\" Giacalone said. \"That's just the cost of doing business ... If you're involved in active policing, you're going to get (complaints).\"\n\nData provided by the Civilian Complaint Review Board , the watchdog agency charged with oversight of the NYPD, show the unit garnered lots of complaints over the years. They had 430 complaints in 2019 and 428 in 2018, though the vast majority of those allegations were not proven, the data shows. Officials with CCRB have also said in the past that plainclothes officers were much harder to identify because they were sometimes not wearing badges or name tags and that would lead to unsubstantiated claims.\n\nCCRB Executive Director Darius Charney , whose agency investigates racial profiling and biased policing allegations, said there must be real oversight for the unit to avoid problems that dogged this unit in the past.\n\n\"Unfortunately, in the past, the history shows us that these plainclothes officers were really some of the worst offenders when it came to abusive and discriminatory policing,\" Charney said. \"And I think a lot of that had to do with not only how they were trained or what incentives they were given, but also there was just really a lack of oversight and accountability for officers who did break the law or violate people's rights.\"\n\nAdams' resurrection of this unit is part of his strategy to combat gun violence, which he announced earlier than planned after three weeks of high-profile incidents that was punctuated by the deadly shooting of two NYPD officers answering a domestic disturbance call last week. In all, five New York City Police officers have been shot in the first three weeks of the year.\n\nThe mayor's plan calls for the new teams to be deployed to 30 of the city's 77 precincts and housing units that are responsible for 80% of violence in the city.\n\nRelated article NYC's mayor is a former NYPD captain. This is his plan to combat gun violence in the city\n\nThe NYPD is vetting candidates for the teams now, Adams said.\n\n\"We're going to make sure the 400 plus people that are in the pipeline to go into our new unit ... that they're the best fit for the unit,\" Adams said.\n\n\"We must make sure we don't continue to put dangerous people back on the street and continue the flow of guns in our cities,\" Adams said during a speech, following the shooting of the two officers. \"I'm going to get my cops to do their job. I need the rest of the country that are in positions of authority to do their job.\"\n\nMina said that when he supervised teams in Orlando, he sought officers who could work with minimal supervision and showed they were productive with self-initiated activity.\n\n\"They've already put together cases, shown an aptitude for writing search warrants. Finding people with guns. Or recruiting (confidential informants),\" he said.\n\nThe NYPD's anti-crime unit existed for decades, and was staffed and directed at the precinct level, meant to respond to concerns within those boundaries and staffed by police officers familiar with the people and places in the precinct.\n\nPromotion to NYPD's detective squads typically ran through the anti-crime unit, though that's not always the case in other cities. Promising or ambitious young officers with a few years working uniformed patrol - or those with older relatives or political connections on the job -  would ask into NYPD anti-crime and work there for a couple years before doing 18 months or two years of detective work and earning a detective shield, Giacalone said\n\nRelated article Controversial Police Encounters Fast Facts\n\nOnce NYPD officers were selected for the anti-crime units, they were sent to training and worked their new assignment in plainclothes. They were expected to go after guns and people carrying them (referred to as \"the gun police\" by some residents), so they carried less equipment on their belts than uniformed officers and weren't required to wear a uniform because of the expectation of getting into foot chases, Giacalone said.\n\nWhile the NYPD had its precinct-level anti-crime units, the department also staffed a more elite \"street crime\" unit whose main focus was getting guns. They were also plainclothes and in unmarked cars. In 1999, four officers from that unit fired 41 shots at Amadou Diallo as he stood in the vestibule of his Bronx home.\n\nDiallo was struck 19 times and was killed. The officers, who were later acquitted of murder charges, said they confused his wallet for a gun. The entire unit was eventually disbanded in response to Diallo's death, and the work they did became the responsibility of the anti-crime units which long operated at the precinct, borough and city levels.\n\nControversy over the years, including drug and money related corruption scandals, led to changes and tighter supervision within plainclothes units. This happened as views on policing continued to evolve across the country and cities started seeing an influx of drugs, drug money, and street violence and police corruption related to both.\n\nAfter the Diallo shooting, the NYPD's anti-crime unit's focus remained on guns and violence. Then, in June 2020, then NYPD Police Commissioner Dermot Shea announced that he disbanded all levels of the anti-crime unit , sending roughly 200 members to the detective bureau and spreading others out to different units.\n\nThe move to disband the unit followed protests, in New York and across the country, over the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. Other cities, in the wake of protests, reexamined their staffing and the utility of proactive policing. But the move in New York was reversed within about two months, as shootings in New York City spiked following the protests. The teams returned as Public Safety Teams, working unmarked cars but in full uniform, city officials have said.\n\nRelated article Second NYPD officer who was shot in Harlem last week has died\n\nThe NYPD's teams were typically composed of three officers and a sergeant working shifts that extend into the evening or overnight. In other parts of policing, in other cities and in patrol, sergeants will typically oversee a larger number of officers, from six to 10. Part of the reason for greater supervision, Giacalone said, was to prevent corruption.\n\nMina, who worked in and supervised a similar unit in the Orlando Police Department and whose department now has a similar unit, said that more supervision in high-risk situations was beneficial for everyone.\n\n\"If it's always wanted people you're going after, or people known to carry guns, you're going to want the span of control to be tighter so you can manage and supervise what's going on,\" Mina said. \"Making sure you're safe, the public's safe, and making sure the bad guy is safe and situations can be peacefully resolved. Supervision is a good thing.\"\n\nTwo points of contention - the lack of a uniform and the unmarked vehicles - came to represent, to critics, bad policing and unwarranted aggression. The officers in the new unit won't wear uniforms but will wear jackets with police insignia, a slight departure from the past where officers were required to wear the shield identifying themselves as officers outside their outermost layer of clothing.\n\n\"In many communities, that is a sign that you're about to be attacked,\" Adams said about plainclothes cops jumping out of their car. \"That has created a lot of hostility. We are going to make sure that the version of plainclothes officers will have modified police attire so that they are quickly identified as police officers.\n\nAccording to experts, for the most part, unmarked cars and officers in baseball caps and oversized shirts weren't fooling anyone, but it's a common defense for someone who runs from the police that they didn't know the person chasing them was an officer. And the reason for a lighter duty belt was for it to be easier to give chase.\n\n\"Defense attorneys are gonna do what they do ... What are they going to say, (their client) knew he was the police and ran?  You could be wearing a clown outfit and (the defense attorney) would say (their client) didn't know it was a clown,\" Giacalone said.\n\nRelated article Stay away from the platform edge, New York City subway chief urges after latest attack in transit system\n\nMina said unmarked cars, especially at night, can buy an officer a few seconds of advantage. Being able to get a little closer, or evading detection for even a couple more seconds, is sometimes all an officer needs to capture someone evading custody.\n\n\"If you're standing there (selling drugs), you're not going to throw dope or run every time you see a car that's not marked. They're looking, don't get me wrong. And in some cases, we catch 'em sleeping, not paying attention. But it buys you a few more seconds,\" he said. \"The idea is they get just a little bit closer than a marked unit, and sometimes even a second or two is helpful ... you're not fooling anyone but it will get you a little closer and buy you a second or two of hesitation.\"\n\nThe units also came to be associated with NYPD's stop-and-frisk policy. Stop-and-frisk , where police stopped and searched those they considered suspicious, had been used to deter crime, law enforcement officials have said in the past in defense of the tactic. But it has also resulted in a slew of lawsuits by residents complaining of unlawful stops.\n\nIn August 2013, a federal judge ruled that stop-and-frisk violated the Constitution and ordered the city to develop remedies, including a federal monitor overseeing the NYPD.\n\nRelated article 'It's a disturbing trend.' Cities see large increases in carjackings during pandemic\n\nCharney, now with the CCRB, was the plaintiff's attorney in the landmark stop-and-frisk case that ended the practice in New York. It was the same case where Mayor Adams - then a state senator, testified that he had a sit-down with then New York Gov. David Paterson and the NYPD commissioner at the time, Ray Kelly, regarding a stop-and-frisk bill.\n\nAdams testified that Kelly said the policy targeted Blacks and Hispanics disproportionately, \"because he wanted to instill fear in them, every time they leave their home, they could be stopped by police,\" according to court records. Kelly denied that assertion.\n\n\"I think this time around, we really need to learn from the lessons of the past and make sure that there is going to be real accountability and oversight for these officers. And frankly, any officers in the police department,\" Charney said.\n\nGiacalone said Adams' first test will come with the unit's first high-profile use of force.\n\n\"When something goes bad, and always something will happen ... whether a situation goes sideways, or there's a questionable shooting, going after people with guns and violent crimes, things will happen. Does Adams have the stomach to deal with what comes next? That's the whole thing.\"\n\nCNN's Brynn Gingras contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

      "text": "Top-ranking NYPD officer abruptly resigns amid sexual misconduct allegations\n\nFollow:\n\nThe top uniformed police officer in the New York Police Department has resigned amid allegations he demanded sex from a subordinate in exchange for opportunities to earn extra pay.\n\nPolice Commissioner Jessica Tisch accepted the resignation of Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey Friday night, effective immediately, according to an emailed statement from the department Saturday.\n\nJohn Chell, the department's chief of patrol, will take over as interim chief of department and Philip Rivera will assume Chell's duties as the head of the patrol division, the department said.\n\nThe department declined to comment on the allegations against Maddrey other than to say it \"takes all allegations of sexual misconduct seriously and will thoroughly investigate this matter.\"\n\nA lawyer for his accuser, Lt. Quathisha Epps, said the move was overdue.\n\n\"This should have been done a long time ago,\" attorney Eric Sanders said by phone Saturday. \"This has been years in the making, this kind of behavior. This is not shock for anyone who understands how things work in this department.\"\n\nOn Saturday, Epps filed a complaint against the city with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, claiming that Maddrey engaged in \"quid pro quo sexual harassment\" by coercing her to \"perform unwanted sexual favors in exchange for overtime opportunities in the workplace.\"\n\nEpps, who holds an administrative post in Maddrey's office, said that when she finally pushed back at Maddrey's demands, he retaliated by claiming she was abusing overtime, prompting the department to launch a review.\n\nSanders said his client was then suspended without pay despite putting in her retirement notice earlier this week.\n\nEpps was the department's top earner in fiscal year 2024, earning more than $400,000, according to local media reports - more than half of it in overtime pay.\n\n\"Ms. Epps has endured profound harm at the hands of individuals who exploited their positions of power for personal gain,\" Sanders said in a statement. \"The retaliation she faced for standing up to this abuse underscores the need for immediate reforms to address systemic failures within the NYPD.\"\n\nSpokespersons for the department declined to comment on the complaint, but Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office said it is investigating.\n\n\"These are extremely serious and disturbing claims that allegedly occurred at N.Y.P.D. headquarters in Manhattan,\" the office said in a statement.\n\nMayor Eric Adams, a former police captain, said at an unrelated event Saturday that the allegations against Maddrey were \"extremely concerning and alarming\" and that the department was conducting a full review, the New York Post reported.\n\nMaddrey's attorney, Lambros Lambrou, didn't respond to a request for comment on the various allegations. However, in a statement to the New York Post, he dismissed Epps' claims as \"completely meritless.\"\n\n\"What a convenient time to accuse somebody of misconduct after she's caught stealing time,\" Lambrou told the paper. \"She's obviously drowning and in the deep end of the pool without a lifesaver. She wants to take down as many people as she can.\"\n\nSanders responded that any overtime his client worked was at the request of Maddrey and approved by him and other department officials.\n\nMeanwhile, Maddrey has been the subject of other misconduct allegations, including one from a police captain who says she rebuffed his unwanted advances for years.\n\nJohn Scola, a lawyer for Gabrielle Walls, said in a statement that Maddrey's departure \"vindicates\" the police captain, who this week amended her sexual harassment lawsuit against another top officer to include Maddrey.\n\nWalls said in the filing that she dreaded interacting with Maddrey because he frequently tried to kiss her, prompting her to hide from him with the door locked and lights turned off.\n\n\"We hope this high-profile resignation marks the beginning of a cultural shift to eliminate the pervasive environment of harassment and retaliation within the NYPD,\" Scola said.\n\nA former officer has also claimed Maddrey coerced her into a yearslong affair while he was her supervisor, though that case was dismissed by a state judge last month, the New York Post and others reported.\n\nEarlier this year, an administrative trial judge in the department recommended dropping a disciplinary case against Maddrey regarding a November 2021 incident in which he ordered officers to void the arrest of a retired officer who previously worked for him.\n\nMaddrey joined the police force in 1991 at the age of 20 and rose through the ranks to become chief of patrol in 2021, before being promoted to chief of department last December, according to his department biography .\n\nThe chief of department is charged with overseeing the department's \"crime-fighting strategies, quality of life initiatives, and operational plans,\" according Tisch's Saturday announcement. The chief of patrol manages the department's largest bureau, which consists of 15,000 uniformed patrol officers and 3,000 civilians.\n\n\"The NYPD works tirelessly to protect New Yorkers, and these roles are critical to keeping our communities safe,\" Tisch said in her statement. \"The interim Chiefs of Department and Patrol will continue to lead the efforts to reduce crime and disorder and build public trust.\"\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "A man, a bike and a gun: Police search for evidence to solve the killing of UnitedHealthcare's CEO on the streets of New York\n\nFollow:\n\nAs the manhunt for a still-unidentified suspect in the fatal shooting of a health care executive in Manhattan continues on its fifth day, police are missing key pieces of evidence and combing through what they have gathered for more clues.\n\nThe New York Police Department is working with the FBI and other law enforcement agencies across the country to search for the suspect and offering rewards to the public. Two new photos released by police show the suspect masked with a hood in the backseat of a vehicle and wearing a jacket walking on the street.\n\nWhile authorities say they believe the suspect has long left New York City after fatally shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on Wednesday, they feel confident he will be captured.\n\nHere's what authorities are still trying to find:\n\nAnd here are some of the key pieces of evidence they've gathered:\n\nPolice divers concluded a search for the weapon in a lake in Central Park on Sunday without finding anything, after searching the park's iconic boathouse and Bethesda Fountain on Saturday, a law enforcement official told CNN. The divers operated in the same area Sunday, according to footage from CNN affiliate WABC.\n\nA Peak Design backpack was recovered during a second sweep of the park Friday, a law enforcement source told CNN. Police examined it at a forensic lab in Queens. Inside, they found Monopoly money, a law enforcement source told CNN. It also contained a Tommy Hilfiger jacket, law enforcement officials briefed on the matter told CNN. It was not immediately clear whether other items were in the backpack.\n\nBut crucially, there was no gun in the backpack.\n\nThere has also still been no sign of the bicycle used by the suspect.\n\nMeanwhile, photos of the suspect have been circulated to multiple law enforcement agencies, including airports and border patrol stations along the Mexican and Canadian borders, in the hope he won't slip out of the country.\n\nPolice said the suspect mostly wore a mask covering his face as he traveled through New York. \"We had to go through lots of video evidence to get that one money shot with the mask down,\" said police Commissioner Jessica Tisch, describing a photo of the suspect unmasked in an Upper West Side hostel where he checked in with a fake New Jersey's driver's license .\n\nThe FBI is offering up to $50,000 of reward money for information leading to his arrest and conviction. The NYPD has added another $10,000 .\n\nThompson, 50, was shot on a busy Manhattan street early on December 4 as he approached the New York Hilton Midtown on West 54th Street to attend his company's annual investor conference, according to New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch. The killer was \"lying in wait\" outside the hotel, Tisch said. The CEO was shot at least once in the back and once in the right calf and declared dead at a hospital.\n\nThe shooter then crossed the street from the Hilton and fled northbound through an alley between 54th Street and 55th Street. He rode off on an electric bike on 55th, investigators told CNN. From there, the suspect headed north on Sixth Avenue toward Central Park.\n\nPolice say the man was spotted near the George Washington Bridge and George Washington Port Authority bus terminal at 178th Street around 45 minutes after the shooting. Police have obtained video of the suspect entering the Port Authority Bus Station but not exiting it, indicating he left the city.\n\nThe killing of UnitedHealthcare's CEO has rattled other health care companies concerned about their own leaders' safety and prompted some of them to ramp up security and scrub top executives' photos from their websites.\n\nThe backpack, photos, surveillance videos, ammunition left behind, a burner phone, a water bottle and DNA evidence have thus far helped investigators get closer to zeroing in on the suspect despite hitting dead ends with the use of facial recognition software and an unusable fingerprint previously obtained by police, according to Joseph Kenny, the NYPD's chief detective.\n\nInvestigators continue to search for the electric bike the suspect rode the day of the shooting and are examining whether the shooter used a veterinary gun, a larger firearm used on farms and ranches to put down animals without causing a loud noise, Kenny said Friday.\n\nThe 9 mm shell casings undergoing testing had the words \"delay,\" \"deny\" and \"depose\" written across them, with one word on each of the three bullets, Kenny told reporters.\n\nPolice are looking into whether the words, similar in phrasing to a common description of insurance company tactics - \"Delay, deny, defend\" - may point to a motive. A book critiquing the insurance industry was published with the title \"Delay Deny Defend\" in 2010.\n\nRelated article Why finding the suspected CEO killer is harder than you might think\n\n\"That might be him sending a message saying why it was that he shot (Thompson), but at the same time, it could be a diversion to try to get taken away from the real reason behind it,\" former FBI Special Agent Kenneth Gray told CNN on Saturday.\n\n\"Until he's caught, we won't actually know the purpose of those words,\" Gray said.\n\nAlthough the motive remains unclear, authorities have said they believe the killing was premeditated and targeted. The shooter \"definitely planned this out,\" Kenny told CNN on Friday.\n\n\"He knew what time the victim was going to be walking by. He knew what hotel this conference was going to be in,\" Kenny said.\n\nKenny said video of the suspect about 30 minutes before the shooting shows him \"walking and wandering around the hotel area before he committed this act.\"\n\nThe detective said at a Friday briefing there is no evidence the shooter and CEO had any prior interactions or the shooting was related to Thompson's personal life, according to audio of the briefing the NYPD provided to CNN.\n\n\"As we're going through our investigation, we're coming across a lot of online comments, a lot of online threats, things of that nature,\" Kenny said. \"His wife indicated that he had received some prior threats. I don't know the details of those threats.\"\n\nThompson had worked for UnitedHealthcare since 2004 and was appointed CEO in 2021. He lived in Minnesota and was visiting New York for the company's annual investor conference. He is survived by his wife Paulette and two children.\n\nThe shooting has prompted some to portray the killer as a vigilante enacting justice against a health care system they believe values profits over lives , and some users on social media have mocked the CEO's death. News of the shooting inspired an outpouring of social media stories about denials of claims from UnitedHealthcare and other insurance companies.\n\nPolice are tracking down as many tips as they can, as the manhunt spreads and authorities  try to determine where the suspect might surface.\n\nNYPD officials said they believe the suspect left New York City on an interstate bus, the same mode of transportation investigators believe he used to get to the city days earlier: He traveled to New York on a Greyhound bus starting its route in Atlanta, multiple law enforcement sources told CNN. Those sources added authorities do not know whether the suspect boarded in Atlanta or elsewhere.\n\nThe Atlanta Police Department announced Friday, without elaborating, it will assist the investigation after the NYPD contacted it. NYPD detectives arrived in Atlanta on Saturday as part of the probe, two law enforcement officials briefed on the matter told CNN.\n\nIn the meantime, the gun remains the key piece of outstanding evidence police are searching for, as they build a case against the shooter.\n\nCNN's Zoe Sottile, Elise Hammond, Holly Yan, Meg Tirrell, Dalia Faheid, Linh Tran, Sara Smart, Taylor Galgano, David Goldman, Amanda Musa, Rebekah Riess, Paradise Afshar, Nouran Salahieh, Josh Campbell and Karina Tsui contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "NYPD intelligence strategies employed after 9/11 are now used to fight everyday crime\n\nIn the aftermath of 9/11, New York City law enforcement officials developed a strategy designed to gain intelligence and develop technology to prevent any more attacks. Twenty years and hundreds of millions of dollars later, those same strategies and technological advancements are used to solve crimes.\n\nThe NYPD has made significant technological changes since the destruction of the World Trade Center , adding more cameras, installing license plate readers at points of entry as well as in police cars, and giving their officers smart phones that have access to records and information, officials said. These advances, among others, were developed using federal funding.\n\nRelated article How 9/11 forged an age of political turmoil\n\nSince 2017, the NYPD has spent over $300 million each year on intelligence and counterterrorism, according to the city's independent budget office. The tab for 2021 is also expected to be above $300 million, a spokesperson said.\n\nAnd since 9/11, the NYPD has stopped 51 terror incidents that have either emanated from New York City or where the city was the target, according to John Miller, deputy commissioner for intelligence and counter terrorism . And 25 of those incidents have happened within the last five years, according to Miller.\n\nThe department's anti-terror tools also are being used to solve more run-of-the-mill crimes.\n\n\"The systems that were built with Homeland Security funding in the years after 9/11 are for protecting New York City from the threat of terrorism,\" Miller said. \"We would be remiss, and the federal government fully agrees with this, if we did not use those same tools to fight crime. Our job is to protect life and property and dual use for these tools is a legal and accepted practice.\"\n\nNYPD officials were notified of a heist at a luxury retail store in Manhattan on August 20 where $20,000 worth of handbags were stolen. Five men hopped into a stolen Range Rover and fled with the high priced handbags. Investigators used their plate readers to find them hours later on their way to New Jersey using the Lincoln Tunnel.\n\nRelated article How to help, volunteer and honor 9/11 victims through public service\n\nThe NYPD also used license plate readers to catch Grafton Thomas after federal prosecutors said he entered into a rabbi's home in Monsey and attacked five people with an 18-inch machete. Thomas was arrested an hour after the attack when license plate readers identified his vehicle crossing the George Washington Bridge into New York City, authorities said at the time.\n\nFormer NYPD Chief of Department Terence Monahan says the biggest tool investigators use now is cameras. The prevalence of those cameras allow investigators to follow someone in the moments before they commit a crime and after. Those cameras in combination with license plate readers are what make the difference in solving crimes, Monahan said.\n\n\"We can track a person from the beginning to the end,\" Monahan said. \"If he's wearing a mask when he does the crime we're gonna catch him three hours later without that mask, because we've tracked them all along. We've tracked cars for miles and miles after an incident and see him get out of the car and then identify who the shooter is.\"\n\nNew York Civil Liberties Union director Chris Dunn questioned the extent to which the NYPD uses technology to fight crime.\n\nRelated article Biden releases video commemorating 9/11 attacks ahead of 20th anniversary\n\n\"The NYPD's routine use of 9/11-justified technology is a sobering reminder that extraordinary police tactics justified in the name of terrorism inevitably morph into everyday tactics,\" Dunn said.\n\nMiller defended those tactics.\n\n\"Any suggestion that this is some kind of sweeping surveillance program used to 'spy' on everyday New Yorkers, going about their day-to-day business, or to inhibit protest or dissent is an actual fundamental misunderstanding of these tools, what they are for and our own rules and regulations about how they are used,\" Miller said.\n\nLaura Cooper, executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association - a professional organization for executives of police departments -  told CNN there's \"a delicate balance between weighing privacy with technology.\"\n\n\"You need to have 21st century tools to keep people safe,\" Cooper said. \"I think a lot of departments have worked with a lot of privacy and civil liberties and civil rights groups to strike that balance. Not always perfect by any means. But it's important to have those tools.\"\n\nMiller, who presented at the House Committee on Homeland Security i n New York City on Thursday, highlighted the Joint Terrorism Task Force , which has over 100 NYPD detectives assigned to it.\n\nThose detectives, tasked with heading off attacks before they happen, have the highest security clearance, can crosscheck FBI databases and are privy to the most sensitive data. They then brief officials in New York on any terror threats that may come.\n\nAs of now, the challenge is determining how the recent rise to power of the Taliban correlates to the terror threat.\n\nRelated article 'Those people are not me'\n\n\"What is the loss of control of Afghanistan with at least a US supported government, and some kind of diplomatic and intelligence weapons on the ground mean? The answer is we don't know yet, but the risk is that we're back where we started,\" Miller said. \"The way and the reason a 9/11 could happen and did happen is because al Qaeda was able to have the infrastructure of sanctuary and safety on the ground in Afghanistan unchallenged.\"\n\nMiller said the picture will become more clear as to whether Afghanistan becomes a safe place to harbor terror.\n\n\"Our picture in terms of risk has gotten more complicated and our threat level has picked up a couple of notches and we're going to have to assess that three months out, six months out and a year out from now before we know what that's going to mean,\" Miller said.\n\nMiller was part of a panel of first responder agencies that took part in a discussion on security after the terror attacks on September 11. Other agencies including the Port Authority Police Department, the FDNY, FEMA and the US Coast Guard also participated.\n\nMiller, who spoke of how the NYPD has advanced their technology to keep pace with the ongoing terror threat and now shares intelligence with other agencies, also spoke about propaganda from terrorist organizations, which has only grown louder since the Taliban's takeover .\n\nRelated article How the 9/11 anniversary can provide lessons for healing from Covid-19 trauma\n\n\"We've seen for the 20th anniversary of 9/11, we see for every anniversary, a spate of 9/11 related propaganda by terrorists entities. In this case, it has been louder, more persistent and better organized. It has been infused with a call to action,\" Miller said, highlighting the recent suicide bombing in Afghanistan as an example, in addition to the latest edition of Inspire Magazine which he says was released in June.\n\n\"Propaganda is a psychological operations tactic, but propaganda has translated to action,\" Miller said.\n\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said the threat landscape in the United States has \"evolved over the last 20 years,\" with a greater focus on domestic violent extremists during the last few years, rather than the \"foreign terrorist fighter\" that had been the focus of threats immediately after 9/11.\n\n\"As the threat evolves, it doesn't mean that the prior iteration of that threat has disappeared, but rather we see a rise in prominence of a new threat,\" Mayorkas said after attending a 9/11 security briefing Friday at NYPD headquarters in Manhattan\n\nMayorkas also applauded the partnership between local, state and federal partners in working \"towards a common goal - the safety and security of the American people.\"\n\n\"As we stand here today, 20 years after the 9/11 attacks, we stand stronger and safer as a country,\" he said. \"And we do so because of the partnership we have built over those many years. We share information, we share and provide equipment, expertise, and talent, and dedication.\"\n\nCNN's Peter Nickeas and Laura Ly contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Inside the tense talks between Columbia protesters and administrators before NYPD moved in\n\nMarkets\n\nHot Stocks\n\nFear & Greed Index\n\nLatest Market News\n\nHot Stocks\n\nFollow:\n\nAs one of the lead negotiators for students protesting inside the grounds of Columbia University, Mahmoud Khalil said his primary objective was to get the university to sever all financial ties with Israel.\n\nBut as he offered up draft agreements and counter proposals, spoke with mediators in the encampment and sat across the table from high-ranking school administrators, he said he quickly realized that school leaders \"were willing to negotiate on anything but divestment.\"\n\n\"The university made it very clear they didn't want to criticize Israel or ... want their actions to be interpreted as criticism of Israel,\" Khalil said in an interview with CNN.\n\nKhalil, a 29-year-old Palestinian student seeking a master's degree in public affairs, shared copies of proposals he said he and another student negotiator presented to the administration. Khalil said Columbia never put anything in writing, instead making offers verbally. Still, the documents the students delivered to the administration shed new light on their discussions surrounding issues of divestiture, student amnesty, international aid, and concessions the university was willing to make.\n\n\"The university refused to commit to divestment, and we wanted assurances,\" Khalil said.\n\nThe records and interviews show that Khalil and fellow protesters were unwilling to accept terms offered by Columbia that were similar to proposals that students at other campuses, such as Brown University, had accepted. Columbia, like Brown, offered to review its investments and consider divestitures. But without a firm promise, Columbia's offer didn't go far enough for Khalil and other protesters, since the university had previously rejected divestment proposals.\n\nJust days after the encampment first appeared, Khalil said he and other protest leaders were offered a meeting with school president Minouche Shafik to discuss their demands. They declined, he said, believing it to be a publicity stunt by the school where the substance of their concerns and demands would not be addressed. Instead, they continued negotiating with other administrators from the school.\n\nPart of the protesters' demands called for more transparency of Columbia's investment portfolio to be able to fully assess the university's ties to Israel and the war in Gaza.\n\nLess than 1% of the school's $13.6 billion endowment is publicly disclosed. From that limited information, protestors identified small holdings in 19 companies they believe are connected to the conflict between Israel and Hamas, including defense contractors Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics that make weapons used by Israel, and Caterpillar, whose bulldozers have been used by Israel to demolish Palestinian infrastructure in the West Bank and have been used by the IDF during the ground invasion of Gaza. Based on the students' findings of Columbia's public investments, they asked for more transparency of the university's undisclosed financial holdings.\n\nThe school did not offer to completely open its books to the students but, according to a statement from Shafik, instead offered a process for students to access the school's direct holdings and to more frequently update that list. The university also proposed launching programs to aid childhood development in the West Bank and Gaza, among other suggestions.\n\nKhalil said they then presented Columbia with another offer: Rather than dump Israel-tied investments, Columbia could instead divest from weapons manufacturing companies and any companies complicit in violating international law.\n\nColumbia again declined their offer, Khalil said, instead threatening suspensions for those at the encampment. At that point, Khalil and his co-negotiator got up and walked out.\n\n\"It was clear they didn't want to do anything,\" he said.\n\nShortly thereafter, in a statement on May 1, Shafik announced that the negotiations were over. She said that university leaders had engaged with protesters \"in serious dialogue in good faith\" and offered various overtures including the consideration of new divestment proposals but were \"unable to come to resolution.\" She had earlier stated that the university sought to collaboratively reach an agreement with protesters that would result in the orderly removal of the encampment, which she said had created an unwelcoming environment for many Jewish students and faculty.\n\nA spokesperson for Columbia declined to comment on the details of the negotiations but referred CNN to public comments from Shafik.\n\nThe New York Police Department cleared the student encampment, which involved a variety of participants including Jewish students, after nearly two weeks. The school suspended Khalil, a move they later reversed. A university official who was unwilling to speak on record described Khalil's suspension as \"unintentional.\"\n\nRelated article Trump-appointed judges say they'll boycott Columbia grads over university's handling of protests\n\nMeanwhile, student protesters at some other universities were able to reach agreements with their administrations to reconsider divestiture.\n\nJust a few hours north, at Brown University, the administration agreed to consider divestment from companies that support Israel after what the school's president called \"productive discussions\" with students, who in turn agreed to end their encampment. A school advisory committee will provide a recommendation on whether to divest in the fall, and then a university board will vote on the matter, according to the agreement.\n\nNorthwestern University also reached a deal with protestors in which the school committed to answering questions about specific financial holdings and reestablishing an advisory committee for responsible investment.\n\nOther universities have rejected protesters' calls to divest from Israel and some have outright refused to negotiate. Speaking on CNN's \"State of the Union\" Sunday, University of Florida President Ben Sasse said , \"We just don't negotiate with people who scream the loudest ... A lot of universities bizarrely give the most attention and most voice to the smallest, angriest group, and it's just not what we're going to do here.\"\n\nGiven Columbia's history, Khalil and his fellow students had some reason to be hopeful that the school would be responsive to their demands. The university has a storied history of student protests and demands for divestments on other hot-button issues.\n\nStudents in the 1980s called on the university to withdraw investments in companies doing business in South Africa, which then maintained a racial segregation policy called apartheid. Columbia's student senate approved a plan to divest in 1983 but the university's trustees initially opposed their efforts. The trustees eventually conceded and voted to sell most of the university's stock in US companies with business in the country.\n\nMore recently, Columbia emerged as a leader when in 2015 it became the first college in the United States to divest from private prison companies after a student activist campaign that launched the year before.\n\nColumbia now also refrains from investing in publicly traded tobacco, thermal coal and fossil fuel companies.\n\nBut when it comes to Israel, the university has long taken a different stance.\n\nIn 2002, Columbia's then-president Lee Bollinger criticized a petition to divest from companies that had sold arms to Israel. At the time, Bollinger said, \"The petition alleges human rights abuses and compares Israel to South Africa at the time of apartheid, an analogy I believe is both grotesque and offensive,\" according to the Columbia Daily Spectator student newspaper. An advisory committee sided with Bollinger in opposition to the petition, the paper reported.\n\nComparisons between Israel and the apartheid system in South Africa that ended in the 1990s have sparked contentious debate. The advocacy group Human Rights Watch has accused Israel of seeking the \"domination of Jewish Israelis over Palestinians\" coupled with \"systematic oppression\" and \"inhumane acts,\" which the group argued amounts to apartheid. Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs called those claims \"preposterous and false.\" The Anti-Defamation League stated that Israel has safeguards for ensuring equal treatment of citizens and argued that the apartheid label \"would seem to question the legitimacy of the world's only Jewish state.\"\n\nIn 2016, a coalition of Columbia students again launched a campaign to push the university to cut ties with certain Israel-linked companies.\n\nThat effort eventually led to an undergraduate student vote that favored divesting, but then-president Bollinger again opposed the effort and said in a 2020 statement that such matters aren't decided by student referendum and that the university \"should not change its investment policies on the basis of particular views about a complex policy issue, especially when there is no consensus across the University community about that issue.\"\n\nThe student newspaper reported last month that another vote at Columbia College - an undergraduate school at the university - overwhelmingly favored divestment from Israel, though less than half of the college's students participated.\n\nThe university committee that advises on the ethics of the school's investments also ruled against a proposal to divest from Israel in February. The committee concluded that \"there is significant opposition in the Columbia University community to withdrawing financial support from Israel, as evidenced by the actions of many students, faculty, and alumni.\"\n\nRelated video Inside the Seder dinner on Columbia's Gaza protest encampment\n\nIn recent months, Columbia has faced pressure from donors on matters related to Israel and protesters.\n\nHedge fund billionaire Leon Cooperman threatened in October to halt donations to the university and called for the school to terminate or suspend a professor who had written favorably of Hamas' October 7 attack. Cooperman criticized protesters and said, \"Israel is the only reliable ally the United States has in the Middle East.\" In April, donor Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots, called for the school to end the protests and suggested he would withhold donations because he was \"no longer confident that Columbia can protect its students and staff.\"\n\nEven if Columbia wanted to divest all its assets with varying links to Israel, the nature of endowments makes that quite difficult, experts told CNN.\n\nFor example, the university could easily sell shares of individual stocks it directly holds, but investments in index funds would require someone to painstakingly analyze each company in the fund to understand whether ties to Israel exist. And Columbia may lack authority to dictate terms on private equity investments managed by separate partners.\n\n\"It's much more difficult to put restrictions on the indirect investments,\" said Luigi Zingales, a professor at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business. Zingales argued pro-Palestinian protesters would probably have more success in achieving their goals if they focused on only a few specific companies in which universities have direct investments, rather than calls for broader divestment.\n\nOn Thursday, Columbia's president published an editorial in the Financial Times affirming the university's commitment to free speech. \"We were unable to come to an agreement but this can not be the end of the dialogue,\" Shafik wrote. \"This crisis has also revealed how vulnerable universities are to those that seek to divide us,\" she added.\n\nAs for Khalil, the student negotiator at Columbia, he told CNN that in hindsight he thinks his group may have been too lenient in their negotiation tactics.\n\n\"We were negotiating in very good faith. I would have changed my approach regarding that,\" he said. \"I don't regret not reaching an agreement because the agreement they offered was, to us, literally rubbish. It did not have anything, so I'm glad that we did not accept.\"\n\nWith negotiations over, Khalil said he's focused on strengthening Columbia's Palestinian community and educating a growing number of students interested in, and supportive of, the Palestinian cause.\n\n\"There's definitely a momentum right now,\" he said.\n\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

Donlon is a national security expert who previously ran the FBI's National Threat Center and the FBI-NYPD Joint Terrorist Task Force. He was also the New York state director of the Office of Homeland Security.\n\nCaban's phone was seized last week around the same time that FBI agents raided the homes of top Adams administration officials as part of a separate probe. Those whose homes were searched included First Deputy Mayor Sheena Wright and Deputy Mayor for Public Safety Philip Banks III.\n\nCaban's twin brother, James Caban, who owns a nightclub security business, also had his phone seized in the corruption investigation involving the NYPD.\n\nFederal investigators want to know if James Caban profited from his ties to his powerful brother and the NYPD, according to multiple sources. Specifically, the investigation is looking into whether James Caban was paid by bars and clubs in Midtown Manhattan and Queens to act as a police liaison, and if those clubs were then afforded special treatment by local precincts, the sources said.\n\nLawyers for Edward Caban described him in a statement as an \"accomplished public servant who has dedicated his life to the safety and security of the people of this great city.\"\n\n\"We have been informed by the government that he is not a target of any investigation being conducted by the Southern District of New York, and he expects to cooperate fully with the government,\" said the lawyers, Russell Capone and Rebekah Donaleski.\n\nSpokespersons for the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn the past year, FBI agents have searched the homes of multiple city officials and advisers close to Adams as part of a separate investigation that is believed to be focused on whether the Adams campaign conspired with the Turkish government to receive illegal campaign contributions from foreign sources, funneled through straw donors.\n\nA City Hall source said last week that the latest search did not seem to be related to the Turkey investigation.\n\nAdams has repeatedly deflected questions about the investigation while stressing that he has not officially been accused of wrongdoing.\n\n\"I was as surprised as you to learn of these inquiries and I take them extremely seriously,\" the mayor said Thursday.\n\nHe said he accepted Caban's resignation a short time ago and concluded that \"this is the best decision at this time.\"\n\n\"I respect his decision, and I wish him well,\" Adams added.\n\nJonathan Dienst is chief justice contributor for NBC News and chief investigative reporter for WNBC-TV in New York.\n\nTom Winter is a New York-based correspondent covering crime, courts, terrorism and financial fraud on the East Coast for the NBC News Investigative Unit.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Salvatore Marchese now stands accused of sexual harassment or gender discrimination in four cases since 2013. The 2013 case, which involved an officer who alleged he forced her to perform oral sex, was settled for $100,000, documents show. In August 2022, he was sued for allegedly harassing a pregnant officer and forcing her to work overnight shifts.\n\nThe two new lawsuits filed Wednesday against Marchese and the city allege that Marchese berated female underlings - including a lieutenant - for being pregnant or having to take care of their children. There was no admission of wrongdoing in the case that was settled and Marchese has denied wrongdoing in response to all of the suits.\n\nThe NYPD promoted Marchese to captain in 2018 and assigned him to run stationhouses in Manhattan and the Bronx, NYPD personnel records show.\n\n\"It's really outlandish how they keep letting this man go from command to command, treating people this way,\" said former Lt. Ebony Huntley, a plaintiff in one of the two new suits. The single mom, who as a Black female lieutenant was a rarity in the NYPD , said she retired early to escape Marchese's abuse.\n\n\"Shame on this department for allowing that to happen,\" Huntley said.\n\nA December NBC News investigation found that the NYPD along with some of the nation's largest law enforcement agencies are rife with sexual harassment and gender discrimination against female officers. Reviews of more than 60 lawsuits that were settled or won at trial since 2017, thousands of pages of internal police documents and interviews with female officers, across ranks, found that women who speak out often lose their careers, while many men face little consequences.\n\nOf the 87 NYPD officers accused in court papers of abusing female officers, 27 have since moved up in rank, according to an NBC News review, including Marchese.\n\nMarchese did not respond to requests for comment. The New York City Law Department, which represents the city legally, and Marchese's union representative at the Captains Endowment Association also did not respond.\n\nIn a statement, the NYPD declined to comment on pending litigation, but said, \"The Department does not tolerate discrimination in any form and is committed to respectful work environments for our diverse workforce. The NYPD thoroughly investigates all complaints it receives, and offers several reporting options for NYPD employees, including anonymously.\"\n\n\"The NYPD has been on notice of Marchese's bigoted treatment of women for more than a decade, yet has failed to take corrective action,\" said attorney John Scola, who is representing Huntley and the two other women with pending suits against Marchese over his alleged behavior.\n\nBefore crossing paths with Marchese, Huntley had worked for the department for 20 years as a narcotics officer, a detective and a street sergeant.\n\n\"I am not a softy,\" Huntley said.\n\nHuntley said things changed when Marchese became her boss in September 2022.\n\nOfficer Anajess Alvarez had filed a lawsuit in August alleging that Marchese, then running a different stationhouse in the Bronx, presided over a toxic work environment and refused to move her off the overnight shift when she was pregnant. That case is currently in discovery.\n\nThe department transferred Marchese to the stationhouse where Huntley worked in Upper Manhattan.\n\n\"I was like, 'Hey, he can't be that bad,'\" Huntley said.\n\nTensions flared, she said, when she refused Marchese's demand that she punish a female officer who had complained about Marchese's alleged abuse while she was pregnant and after her child was born. Huntley said she refused Marchese's demand that she deny the officer time off and take away her assignments.\n\nThat officer, Elizabeth Munoz, filed her own gender discrimination lawsuit this week against Marchese and the city of New York, the fourth suit against the captain. Like Huntley and Alvarez, she is  represented by Scola.\n\nHuntley said once she defended Munoz, the retaliation began. She said Marchese would berate her, openly insulting her in front of other police.\n\n\"This is more than just a hostile environment. This is sick. It has affected every person's life in this command in a negative way,\" a male officer who works in the stationhouse said. The officer, whom NBC News is not naming since he is not authorized to speak publicly, added that the NYPD's current police commissioner, the first woman to run the department, \"should have zero tolerance for discrimination against any female on this job.\"\n\nThings got so bad, Huntley alleges in her complaint, that five of her sergeants complained about Marchese's behavior to internal affairs.\n\nHuntley said she lasted less than four months under Marchese's watch. She said she had no choice but to retire early in January after he pulled her off the midnight shift. She said he ignored her pleas that she has to care for a young son and a father with cancer.\n\n\"I'm a woman, I'm Black, I'm a single parent. It's been hard all the way through,\" Huntley said. \"I did not deserve to be treated the way this man treated me.\"\n\nEmily Siegel is an investigative reporter with the NBC News Investigative Unit.\n\nSimone Weichselbaum is a national investigative reporter for NBC News, focusing on local and federal law enforcement issues.

He said he felt the report did a fairly good job of \"threading the needle between explaining the context and why police response to protest situations are challenging while also very honestly and directly identifying agency failures.\"\n\n\"Context is really important in protests,\" he said. \"I totally agree with this report that there was a strategic failure here.\"\n\n\"It's not enough today for police agencies to just have a crowd control or riot response plan, but to have a peaceful protest strategy,\" he added.\n\nThe summer saw thousands of people in a nationwide movement protesting the killing of Floyd and Breonna Taylor, a Black woman killed in a botched raid in her home by white officers.\n\n\"Anyone who is paying attention could have seen this,\" Stoughton said, following previous years of massive protests against the killing of men and women of color at the hands of police.\n\n\"The strategy has to be more nuanced, what shocked me not just about New York but agencies around the country, this was very predictable,\" he said.\n\nDaniella Silva is a national reporter for NBC News, focusing on immigration and education.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Four of them face charges of second-degree assault, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said at an afternoon news conference.\n\nThe names of two defendants who were indicted were not released because they have not been arrested, Bragg said.\n\n\"This assault ... sickened me and outraged me,\" Bragg said. \"As a lifelong New Yorker, I do not tolerate attacks on police officers, and certainly I do not as Manhattan district attorney.\"\n\nThe melee occurred the night of Jan. 27 as police were trying to disperse a crowd when a fight broke out. The officers who were assaulted sustained minor injuries, police said.\n\nThe five suspects who were previously arrested and were indicted are Yorman Reveron, 24; Darwin Andres Gomez-Izquiel, 19; Kelvin Servita Arocha, 19; Wilson Juarez, 21; and Yohenry Brito, 24.\n\nBragg called the investigation by prosecutors and police \"meticulous\" and detailed some of the defendants' alleged crimes .\n\nGomez-Izquiel allegedly grabbed one officer and kicked another, and Reveron allegedly grabbed and pulled two officers to the ground.\n\nBoth men are charged with two counts of second-degree assault and obstructing governmental administration, Bragg said.\n\nTwo of the men - Juarez and Servita Arocha - did not assault police, Bragg said.\n\nJuarez gave a suspect a jacket and then put a jacket on before he discarded it to avoid an arrest, Bragg said. He is charged with tampering with physical evidence and third-degree hindering prosecution, prosecutors said.\n\nServita Arocha is charged with second-degree assault and obstructing governmental administration after he allegedly kicked a police radio.\n\nBrito, who authorities said was at the center of the melee when he refused to follow police orders to move because he and a group were blocking the street, was charged with two counts of second-degree assault, obstructing governmental administration, tampering with physical evidence and third-degree hindering prosecution, Bragg said.\n\nBrito has been held on bail since Feb. 1, Bragg said.\n\nReveron, Gomez-Izquiel, Servita Arocha and Juarez were released on their own recognizance after their arraignments.\n\nOn Jan. 31, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul criticized the decision to allow the suspects to be released.\n\n\"I'm not satisfied with that at all,\" she said. \"These are law enforcement officers, who should never, under any circumstances, be subjected to physical assault. It's wrong on all accounts, and I'm looking to judges and prosecutors to do the right thing. We have changed bail laws . We have different laws now as a result of what we did in 2022, in the 2023 budgets, and we're seeing a decline in repeat offenders. We have all sorts of data that shows it's working, but that situation is abhorrent to me.\"\n\nPolice have said some of the suspects who were released were believed to have taken a bus out of New York City. The men were not required to stay in New York based on the terms of their release.\n\nBragg announced Thursday that authorities are seeking four more people suspected of assaulting the officers.\n\nUp to 13 people may have been involved in the attack, prosecutors said.\n\nOfficials with Immigration and Customs Enforcement said this week that the agency had apprehended four people believed to be involved in the attack. However, three senior law enforcement officials told NBC News the people in ICE custody do not match the identities or names of those involved in the New York attack.\n\nA police spokesperson had previously said seven people arrested in connection with last month's incident are migrants. NBC News has not been able to confirm that or how long they have been in the U.S. At least two defendants provided addresses that have been used as shelters for recently arrived migrants.\n\nNew York Mayor Eric Adams, who also spoke to reporters Thursday, said that authorities do not care whether the defendants were migrants or asylum- seekers and that the majority within those groups are law-abiding citizens.\n\nBut, he said that if the indicted defendants are convicted, the federal government should do its job \"in deporting them from our city.\"\n\nAuthorities did not speak Thursday about the whereabouts of the defendants who may have absconded.\n\nAntonio Planas is a breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

The statement said that the group that breached Hamilton Hall appeared to be led by people who werenât affiliated with the university.\n\nThe school had previously suspended students who refused to leave the days-long encampment. Earlier on Tuesday, the NYPD said they would not enter Columbiaâs property without another request from the university.\n\nThe White House earlier denounced the studentsâ takeover of Hamilton Hall as âabsolutely the wrong approachâ that is ânot an example of peaceful protest.â\n\nMore than 1,000 protesters have been arrested across US campuses in recent weeks, as demonstrations demanding universities to divest from companies with ties to Israel have intensified.\n\nThe White House issued what is being viewed as its strongest condemnation yet of the pro-Palestinian campus demonstrations. âPresident Biden respects the right to free expression, but protests must be peaceful and lawful. Forcibly taking over buildings is not peaceful â it is wrong,â White House Deputy Press Secretary Andrew Bates said in a statement Tuesday, adding that the president condemned âantisemitic smears.â While Bidenâs shift to a more aggressive tone likely isnât enough to appease pro-Israel Democrats who have called the president to take a stronger stance against the protests, it could also risk alienating younger voters , according to CNN, who already disapprove of his handling of the Israel-Hamas war. âMore and more youth find themselves disillusioned with the party,â warned the College Democrats of America, a group that supports Bidenâs reelection.\n\nRepublican House Speaker Mike Johnson, who has urged Columbiaâs president to resign over what he says are failures to stop antisemitism on campus, said last week he would consider pulling federal funds from colleges with pro-Palestinian protests. âWeâre looking at very seriously reducing or eliminating any federal funds at all to campuses who cannot maintain basic safety and security of Jewish students,â Johnson said. Yanking taxpayer money from colleges isnât easy, however. Itâs âa move so rife with potential unintended consequences and legal hurdles that the Trump administration never followed through on its own threats against school funding,â Politico reported.\n\nSome protestersâ calls for universities to divest from weapons manufacturers and companies that do business with Israel would be âpractically impossible â to do, experts told The Washington Post, because of how the institutionsâ endowments are invested. However, one endowment expert argued: âI think anything is possible in todayâs financial services industry.â  Regardless of the practicality, divestment from Israel wouldnât do anything âfinancially meaningful ,â The Wall Street Journalâs senior markets columnist wrote. The divestment campaign âcan only succeed by isolating Israel culturally. It canât work financially.â\n\nSign up for Semafor flagship\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives."

      "text": "Democrats are stuck in a familiar place: Arguing over Israel\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nDemocrats arrived to work in Washington facing yet another no-win news cycle around Israel, as a fresh round of police raids on campus protests continued to split their party.\n\nThe reactions ranged from fiery denunciations of police tactics as an authoritarian overreaction to equally sharp denunciations of the protests themselves as cover for antisemitism and terrorism.\n\nâThe protesters at Columbia demonstrated that there are two factions of the protesters â thereâs the pro-Hamas, and then thereâs the really pro-Hamas,â Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman told Semafor. He was, he said, âglad that they chose to have the police come in and take charge.â\n\nIn the House, Rep. Jamaal Bowman delivered an impassioned speech backing the protests at Columbia University, in which he accused police of inflicting âbrutalityâ on student demonstrators who were cleared from their encampment and campus buildings Tuesday night.\n\nâAnd for what?â he asked. âSimply exercising their first amendment rights to peacefully assemble as they protest the collective punishment of civilians in Gaza.âÂ\n\nAt a press conference hours later, Minority Leader defended the policeâs approach. âAs far as I can tell, the efforts by the NYPD were thorough, professional and they exercised a degree of calm in a very tense situation,â he said . âThat should be commended.â\n\nAccording to one senior Democratic aide, the partyâs House leaders did not offer any messaging guidance to members regarding the demonstrations. âDemocrats donât want to bring attention to the protests,â they said.\n\nRep. Becca Balint, a Vermont progressive, said the party was feeling the pressure with the election growing closer.\n\nâIâm an anxious little Jewish woman, Iâm an anxious little dyke from Vermont, of course Iâm worried,â she said. âHow can I not be worried? Frickinâ Trump is a freaking maniac and heâs like neck and neck. Of course Iâm worried. Iâm anxious all the time.â\n\nBut addressing it meant a balancing act. She said Biden needed to âspeak directly to these young people who are devastated by the incredible suffering thatâs going on right nowâ and âbe a champion for free speechâ while also condemning antisemitism that âright now is off the charts.â\n\nSen. Jon Tester, up for re-election in red state Montana, emphasized that the specific tactics of the protests âÂ including breaking into Columbiaâs Hamilton Hall âÂ crossed the bounds of protected speech.\n\nâI am all about First amendment rights, free speech, the ability to protest,â he told Semafor. âBut if those protesters are committing crimes, violence, breaking windows, they need to be dealt with in a way thatâs commensurate with their actions.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nThese questions of balancing protection for speech with fears of intimidation on campus played out on the House floor, where Democrats debated whether to sign onto a bill directing the Department of Education to investigate alleged instances of antisemitism on campus using the definition created by International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, which encompasses some criticisms of Israel common among activists.\n\nThe bill ultimately passed 320-to-91, with 70 Democrats opposing it. The bill won backing from Jeffries and other party leaders. But some criticized the legislation as a bad faith messaging exercise by Republicans. âIt doesnât do anything to combat antisemitism,â Rep. Jerry Nadler, one of the most senior Jewish Democrats in Congress, told Politico . âItâs pure demagoguery.â\n\nSome Republicans also shared objections to the wording as overly broad. Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene warned on X that a provision prohibiting symbols tying Israel to accusations that Jews killed Jesus âcould convict Christians of antisemitism for believing the Gospel that says Jesus was handed over to Herod to be crucified by the Jews.â\n\nThe root of the Democratsâ problems ultimately is not a specific protest group or tactic or bill. Rather, itâs a deep, substantive divide among their elected officials, voters, donors, and interest groups over Israel and Gaza. One recurring sentiment among Democrats on Wednesday was that the surest route to progress on unrest at home was progress on ending the war abroad, one way or another.\n\nSeveral noted that the Biden administration has been trying to push Hamas and the Israeli government towards a deal that would free hostages and implement a temporary ceasefire with the hopes of a more durable deal later on.\n\nâIt just demonstrates the critical need for us to continue to work to find a hostage release and ceasefire,â Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine told Semafor.\n\nIn the meantime, Kaine suggested Biden and Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona point to âcampuses where this is being handled well, where thereâs robust debate and dialogue about this very tough issue without disruptionâ as models for others to follow.\n\nKadia Goba contributed reporting\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

But President Trump will finally be arraigned today in a Manhattan courtroom, where heâll hear the more than 30 unsealed counts  waiting for him. Itâs the news event of the year, and our team has an hour-by-hour preview of the dayâs drama ahead, from protests to Trumpâs planned remarks tonight at Mar-a-Lago. As for the lack of a mugshot: I guess the makers of Americaâs political swag can always make due with an AI portrait.\n\nIn other news â yes, thereâs other news â Joseph Zeballos-Roig writes on the floundering efforts by Senators Bill Cassidy, R-La. and Angus King, I-Maine to build a bipartisan plan to extend Social Securityâs solvency. The problem? Democrats donât actually want to sign on to the emerging proposal.\n\nBe sure to check out the Semafor World Economy Summit , which takes place next Wednesday in Washington, DC. and will stream online for a global audience. The eventâs headliners include White House National Economic Council director Lael Brainard, U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai, Carlyle Group co-founder David Rubenstein, White House Senior Advisor for Infrastructure and former New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu, UPS CEO Carol Tome, GE CEO Larry Culp, former Federal Reserve Board Governor Roger Ferguson, former Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker, Singapore Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Jordan Finance Minister Mohamad Al Ississ, and many others.\n\nPLUS, Morgan Chalfant has One Good Text with former Pentagon official and China expert Elbridge Colby on what Speaker Kevin McCarthy ought to tell Taiwanâs President when they meet tomorrow.\n\nWas this email forwarded to you? Sign up here!\n\nDonald Trump will be arraigned on Tuesday in Manhattan on the first charges to emerge out of the many investigations into his business, campaign, and personal behavior over the years.\n\nThe spectacle is already the news event of the year, with the cable networks tracking his plane and motorcade by helicopter on Monday on his way to Trump Tower. Hereâs a timeline for what to expect today, which will feature protests, speeches, press conferences, and of course, Trumpâs courthouse appearance.\n\n8:00 AM: The New York Young Republican Club, which is organizing a protest, begins setting up. The NYPD has already sectioned off two sections of Collect Pond Park, directly across the street from the courthouse at 100 Centre Street. Trump supporters are expected to arrive on the south side of the park, counter-protestors on the north. Things were quiet in the area on Monday, except for a crush of media. Reporters â or the placeholders their companies hired â  began lining up well before 4pm in the hopes of getting a first-come, first-serve ticket into the courtroom the next morning (or one of the overflow rooms within the building).\n\n10:30 AM: Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. is expected to arrive at the rally. NYYRC president Gavin Wax told Semafor sheâll be the de facto leader of the event, which will feature speeches and chanting. âSheâs really been pushing it and sheâll probably be the biggest named elected official there,â he said. Other politicians may also make appearances, however.\n\nWith memories of January 6th still fresh, New York authorities are preemptively deploying police through the city. Mayor Eric Adams, a former officer himself, called on protestors to behave themselves, and specifically Greene, who he said was âknown to spread misinformation and hate speech.â\n\nGreene told Semafor that she doesnât expect any fireworks. âEvery single officer has been called up,â she said. She plans to shake hands with cops and thank them for safeguarding the event and said she âwill be pointing at people to be arrested if theyâre being violent.â\n\nTrump is expected to present himself at the courthouse, accompanied by Secret Service, at some time in the late morning.\n\n2:15 PM: Trump will face the charges against him in the courtroom and plead not guilty. The judge presiding over the case is Juan Merchan , who Trump criticized late last week by suggesting he was biased. Trumpâs attorney Joe Tacopina said over the weekend that he had no reason to take issue with Merchan, however, who presided over the tax fraud case against the Trump Organization and former Trump Organization executive Allen Weisselberg. Merchan denied a motion to allow live cameras inside the courtroom late Monday, siding with Trumpâs legal team, but a small number of photojournalists will be briefly allowed inside and members of the press will be present as well.\n\nThereâs been plenty of reporting and speculation around what Trump would do for his mug shot. Smile brightly, like former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay? Or look serious like former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich , who Trump later pardoned? Unfortunately for Americaâs political merchandisers, Yahoo Newsâs Michael Isikoff reported Monday that Trump will ânot be put in handcuffs, placed in a jail cell or subjected to a mug shot,â because prosecutors determined it wasnât necessary for an ex-president.\n\n3:30 PM: Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg is set to hold a press conference. Bragg has faced months of intense scrutiny from his left and right and plenty of criticism, including from legal experts outside Trumpâs orbit. This will be his first chance to lay out the details of the case on his own terms.\n\n8:15 PM: The former president will end his day with a quick return back to his Mar-a-Lago home. He plans to give remarks to the nation at 8:15pm, despite his team reportedly being concerned about a potential gag order from the judge that would prevent him from discussing the case. A Trump campaign source told Semafor that theyâre âpreparing for every single scenario.â\n\nâSemafor Staff\n\nâ White House: Biden will hold a meeting with science and technology advisers about artificial intelligence at the White House this afternoon. A spokeswoman wouldnât entertain a question yesterday about whether Biden has been watching any of the coverage of former President Trumpâs indictment on television.\n\nâ Senate: Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer praised Bidenâs Labor Secretary nominee Julie Su after their meeting last week. But Su could face headwinds to getting confirmed after the two-week recess: She received no Republican support in 2021 when she was picked for her current job as deputy labor secretary.\n\nâ House: Itâs official: Speaker Kevin McCarthy will meet with Taiwanâs President Tsai Ing-wen on Wednesday at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California. A handful of Democrats and Republicans will join him. China issued another warning about the meeting.\n\nEmbattled Rep. George Santos, R-N.Y. will face a primary challenge from Kellen Curry, a former vice president at JPMorgan and Air Force veteran. Curry summed up his campaign pitch to Bloomberg: âRestoring honesty and integrity back to congressional representation.â Santos told Semafor he welcomes the challenge. âThe more people giving Joe Cairo a headache the merrier. I believe in the people and I believe in our democracy,â he said, name-checking the Nassau County Republican Party chairman who called for Santos to resign after revelations about his resume fabrications.\n\nFloridaâs state senate passed a bill that would ban abortions after six weeks. The measure, which includes exceptions for the life of the mother and pregnancies from rape or incest, has Gov. Ron DeSantisâ backing. On the same day, DeSantis also signed legislation that would allow Floridians to carry a concealed firearm without a permit. The law became an immediate target of the White House, where press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre rebuked it as the âopposite of commonsense gun safety.â\n\nAnd in other Florida news: Disney CEO Bob Iger took direct aim at Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis during a shareholders meeting, accusing the Republican governor and likely 2024 presidential candidate of trying to punish Disney âfor its exercise of a constitutional right.â The two have tussled over Disneyâs opposition to a law restricting classroom discussion about gender identity. Iger accused DeSantis of being âanti-business.â\n\nRoy McGrath, who served as chief of staff to former Maryland governor Larry Hogan, was killed in a confrontation with the FBI while on the lam from embezzlement charges. The FBI confirmed an âagent-involved shootingâ in Tennessee during an attempted arrest, according to the Washington Post, but few details beyond that. Hogan, who broke with McGrath over the allegations, said in a statement that he and his wife were âdeeply saddened by this tragic situation.â\n\nFinland becomes NATOâs 31st member today.

Angus King of Maine and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, had eyed establishing a new investment fund to finance future benefits and gradually raising the retirement age to nearly 70, among other options. But King, an independent, is struggling to amass support from his Democratic colleagues, with whom he caucuses. Thatâs contributing to a holdup in releasing a bipartisan framework, according to three people familiar with the talks.\n\nNo Democrats so far are willing to sign on as original co-sponsors of a potential final proposal, despite the fact that Sens. Tim Kaine of Virginia, D-Va., and Kyrsten Sinema, another independent who caucuses with Democrats, form part of the bipartisan gang. Both are up for re-election in 2024.\n\nAsked if Kaine was open to co-sponsoring the final product, a spokesperson for the Virginia Democrat responded, âKaine is not aware of any proposed legislation.â Sinemaâs office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nJOSEPHâS VIEW\n\nThe Cassidy-King effort has always been something of a Hail Mary given the growing reluctance in both parties to touch Social Security, which is currently on a trajectory toward insolvency that would trigger large, automatic benefit cuts in a decade. A comprehensive fix that extends the lifespan of the program by 75 years â the common metric used to measure solvency â is slipping further and further out of reach.\n\nBoth President Biden and Trump, the current front-runner for the 2024 GOP nomination, are pledging to keep their hands off Social Security benefits, dampening the odds of a bipartisan agreement to salvage the program ahead of a combative presidential campaign.\n\nThe last Social Security deal in 1983 contained a mix of tax increases and benefit cuts that was brokered by the Reagan White House with only months to go until the program would be unable to pay full benefits. Time is still Washingtonâs ally, but many believe any major reform effort today would need similar involvement from the executive branch to help steel lawmakers against a barrage of political attacks.\n\nâSenate Democrats are probably looking around and wondering why they should position themselves to the right of Donald Trump,â a Senate Democratic aide told Semafor.\n\nCassidy has criticized Biden for refusing to personally negotiate on Social Security after a string of mostly staff-level meetings with the White House failed to yield a breakthrough. Heâs repeatedly assailed the president for not detailing how he would secure the retirement program. The Louisiana Republican recently signaled the group wonât release a framework that doesnât have buy-in from the White House.\n\nâWhat I really admire about my friend Bill Cassidy is heâll come to the table with just a whole plate of different ideas,â Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said in a recent interview. âSome of them donât pan out, but he is just so willing to put things out there.â\n\nTwo of the three sources said King-Cassidy staff had been trying lately to shore up external support among unions by touting a measure to repeal a provision within Social Security that reduces benefits for some retired public sector workers.\n\nBut thereâs significant unease among organized labor at being kept in the dark on other pieces of the proposal. A separate person directly briefed on the groupâs outreach said Cassidyâs staff had requested an endorsement from their organization without showing legislative language and dodging questions about key aspects of their plan.\n\nEven moderate Democrats remain skeptical about proposals like raising the retirement age, which is enormously unpopular with the American public. âIt all has to be in a big package for me to look at. In isolation itâs a non-starter because everybodyâs different,â Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont. told Semafor. âYou get a farmer, 69, youâre gonna have the shit pounded out of your body by then. Somebody whoâs sitting at a desk for their whole life, maybe not so much.â\n\nROOM FOR DISAGREEMENT\n\nCassidy is holding firm that his proposal is critical to extending Social Securityâs lifespan while avoiding enormous benefit cuts. A new report from the Social Security and Medicare Trustees recently projected that the program will be insolvent in 2033, a year earlier than projected last year.\n\nâThereâs no difference between Joe Biden and Donald Trumpâs âSocial Security plan,ââ Cassidy told Semafor in a statement. âThey donât have one and choosing to do nothing is a 24% cut in Social Security benefits for everyone.â\n\nElbridge Colby is the author of â The Strategy of Denial: American Defense in an Age of Great Power Conflict â and co-founder of The Marathon Initiative. He served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy and Force Development under the Trump administration and led the development of the 2018 National Defense Strategy.\n\nStories that are being largely ignored by either left-leaning or right-leaning outlets, according to data from our partners at Ground News.\n\nWHAT THE LEFT ISNâT READING: Rep.

      "text": "Americana\n\nTHE SCENE\n\nIt was a triumphant day for Patti Peeples, but one thing didnât sit right with her.\n\nFor more than a year, the 61-year-old Florida landlord fought to tighten the stateâs law against squatting, a crime she saw up close when two women faked a rental agreement and occupied one of her Jacksonville properties. Sheâd done interview after interview , worked closely with her local legislators, and testified in Tallahassee. The result, a tough new law that would let sheriffs evict squatters without entering a lengthy legal process, passed with unanimous bipartisan support.\n\nOn Wednesday, invited by her Republican state representative, Peeples arrived at the bill signing in Orlando. The longtime Democrat took her seat next to a local Republican fund-raiser as Gov. Ron DeSantis described squatter horror stories from New York. âIllegal aliensâ were âinstructing other foreigners how to come into this country and commandeer property,â he said; then he introduced Flash Shelton, a âsquatter hunterâ from California, who thanked the governor for taking action.\n\nâWhat passes muster in New York and California isnât passing muster here,â said DeSantis. Peeples had won; but how, she wondered, had her cause suddenly been turned into a political cudgel for conservatives?\n\nâThis is the good and the bad of politics in our country,â she told Semafor. âIt was nonsensical to showcase an individual who had nothing to do with the bill being written and passed, doesnât live in the state of Florida, and makes money from his business that uses tactics to remove squatters that could be copied and increase the chance of violence.â\n\nIn multiple states, including New York and Florida, viral stories about people seizing homes they donât own have inspired legislation to stop it. Thereâs no organized partisan opposition to those bills. But Republicans have seized the initiative, warning of a squatter crisis inflamed by liberal crime policies and illegal immigration; a popular migrant TikTok influencerâs video urging people to âinvadeâ and âseizeâ homes burned through conservative media just as the Florida bill was passing.\n\nâThere are challenges, with adverse possession being exploited to benefit unethical behavior by a few,â said Democratic state Rep. Anna Eskamani, who like every member of her party supported the anti-squatter bill. âThe rhetoric the governor used was never mentioned anywhere during the [legislative] process. Leave it to DeSantis to make every issue partisan.â\n\nDAVIDâS VIEW\n\nBack in February, while I was talking to South Carolina Rep. Ralph Norman at a Nikki Haley rally, a voter stepped in and asked me to wrap it up, so he could talk to the congressman about âsquatters.â He was worried about them stealing homes in his retirement community; Norman urged him to talk to his sheriff, because Congress would be too slow to act.\n\nThis was how I realized that a story that wasnât part of the campaign discourse â even as it was covered frequently by local news â was breaking through. Conservative media was all over this topic, and politicians were slow to catch up.\n\nFox News and the New York Post, the brightest suns in Rupert Murdochâs media galaxy, have heavily covered a string of unrelated, sometimes frightening stories involving squatters, including one incident where a woman was killed by the people who had taken over her Manhattan apartment. DeSantisâs signing ceremony was streamed live by Fox â a throwback to the pre-primary days when heâd ride the conservative zeitgeist to friendly coverage.\n\nBut this isnât like the partisan squabbles over Floridaâs parental rights law, or shuttling asylum-seekers to the bluest possible cities. In Georgia, like Florida, there was no opposition to anti-squatter legislation that moved after weeks of stories about a growing crisis. In South Carolina, a version introduced by a Republican state legislator running for Congress was co-sponsored by half of his colleagues, in both parties.\n\nAnd in New York, where Democrats hold a legislative supermajority, Republican Assemblyman Jake Blumencranz introduced his anti-squatter bill with Democratic co-sponsors. His own Fox News interview started with the viral âinvasionâ TikTok, as a study in what he needed to stop.\n\nâUnfortunately, videos like that one you saw on TikTok is one of many of people teaching others how they can utilize New Yorkâs laws to their advantage,â said Blumencranz, whose law would rewrite the stateâs definition of âtenantâ to exclude people staying in homes they donât pay for.\n\nNew York Cityâs laws, which DeSantis singled out on Wednesday, are unusually generous to tenants; if theyâve occupied a home for more than 30 days, owners who want them out have to go to court . All of that was laid out in a March 21 report, by a New York ABC affiliate, that filmed an owner/squatter nightmare â a woman being handcuffed after the illegal tenants sheâd just ejected called police and brandished phony documents.\n\nThat story, combined with the âinvasionâ TikTok, got politicians scrambling; Queens councilwoman Vickie Paladino rallied fretful New Yorkers on Monday, proposing a bill that would extend the 30-day rule to 180 days. Even when thereâs no Democratic opposition, itâs a simple story for Republicans to tell: A sclerotic government is letting criminals run over people like you.\n\nTHE VIEW FROM PROGRESSIVES\n\nSome progressive writers argue that the squatting stories have been blown out of proportion. In Popular Information , Judd Legum and Tesnim Zekeria recently broke down what they call the âhysteriaâ over the issue, which they said was âdistracting attention from Americaâs actual housing crisis.â\n\nBut even among activists on the left, criticisms of the anti-squatter proposals have been relatively mild. In Florida, the only skeptics of the new law were housing-rights advocates. Florida Rising lobbied to change the bill, warning that some people living illegally in homes might be taken advantage of by phony landlords. Legislators adopted their concerns in the final bill, and the group took a neutral position. But Cynthia Laurent, a housing justice campaigner at Florida Rising, said that âthis was not coming up as an issue in this stateâ until recently.\n\nâWe heard about Patti Peeplesâs situation, and that was horrible, but we wanted to make sure that this didnât have impacts on people struggling to stay housed,â said Laurent. âWhat weâve seen is that when some of these laws are implemented, working class Black and brown folks are the ones who end up being harmed.â\n\nNOTABLE\n\nSouth Carolina. A three-judge panel ordered the state to conduct this yearâs elections on a congressional map that it had previously ruled unconstitutional. âThe ideal must bend to the practical,â they wrote, concluding that the Supreme Court had delayed its decision on the map for so long that it would be impossible to implement new district lines before the stateâs June 11 primary. The Charleston-based 1st Congressional District, which Republicans shifted Black voters out of to protect Rep. Nancy Mace, will remain intact; Donald Trump carried the current district by 9 points in 2020.\n\nNancy Mace for Congress, âPuppet.â Two years ago, Trump endorsed Nancy Maceâs primary opponent, calling the Lowcountry congresswoman âabsolutely terribleâ and âdisloyalâ after she criticized his role in the Jan. 6 riot. Earlier this month, Trump changed course, endorsing Mace, after she supported him in her home state primary over Nikki Haley. Mace contrasts her MAGA seal of approval with a puppet, representing opponent Catherine Templeton, whoâll say whatever undefined âspecial interestsâ want: âIâm running because I love the establishment.â\n\nFriends of Dave McCormick, âWrestling.â In both of his U.S. Senate runs, McCormickâs biggest vulnerability has been his residence â he left the state to lead a hedge fund from Connecticut. McCormickâs first bio spot focuses entirely on his days as a high school wrestler, with newspaper clips about his record and his decision to join the Army: âHard work, hard choices, the Pennsylvania way.â\n\nMarilyn for Alabama House, âAlyssa.â Democrat Marilyn Lands won a special election by a landslide after attacking the stateâs abortion ban head-on. She did so most dramatically in this ad, produced after Alyssa Gonzales, who had to leave the state to abort a nonviable pregnancy, told her story to HuffPost. Lands joined her for a video and 30-second spot about how she went through the same thing before the stateâs abortion ban: âItâs shameful that today, women have fewer freedoms than I did two decades ago.â\n\nShortly after the Dobbs decision came down, a Wall Street Journal poll found a small plurality of voters in favor of a federal 15-week abortion ban. Thatâs influenced Republican strategic thinking ever since, with the Virginia GOP running on that policy in last yearâs elections and Trump telling a friendly interview that âeven hard-liners are agreeingâ on it. Foxâs poll finds the limit getting less popular the more that Republicans talk about it, with a clear majority of independents now against a 15-week ban; 68% of voters say that mifepristone should be legal, rejecting the argument conservative attorneys made at the Supreme Court this week.\n\nPollsters have asked Americans about the conflict in Gaza from multiple directions, adding caveats about human casualties and prompting them with details of the Oct. 7 attack. But asked directly about the war, most Americans have turned against it, including 75% of Democrats and 60% of independents. Thirty percent of Republicans agree with them, a 7-point jump during a period when Trump didnât weigh in on the war. He only became critical , mostly about how the war was reducing support for Israel, after Gallupâs pollsters left the field.\n\nByteDance, the company that owns TikTok, made no headway with its lobbying against a bill that would ban the app if its China-owned parent company doesnât sell it. Donald Trumpâs flip-flop, from supporting a ban to opposing it, drew attention to his support from Jeff Yass, a ByteDance investor. And most voters (74%) tell Quinnipiac theyâre âconcernedâ about foreign governments grabbing data from the app. Yet theyâre still queasy about a âban.â Thatâs especially true of voters under 35: 71% of them oppose a ban off the bat, and 60% remain against the specific proposal before Congress even when itâs explained.\n\nWhite House. Joe Biden went to New York on Thursday for the most lucrative one-night fundraiser in political history â a $26 million Radio City event with Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, moderated by Stephen Colbert. It was interrupted five times by Gaza protesters, one shouting that donors were âcomplicitâ in genocide; around 100 protesters chanted outside the venue, outnumbered by 5,000 donors whoâd paid a minimum of $225 to attend.\n\nâIâve been working with the Saudis and with all the other Arab countries, including Egypt and Jordan and Qatar,â Biden said in the room. âTheyâre prepared to fully recognize Israel, fully recognize Israel for the first timeâ¦ but there has to be a post-Gaza plan, and there has to be a train to a two-state solution.â\n\nDonald Trump counter-programmed Biden by joining a Long Island wake for Jonathan Diller, an NYPD officer killed at a traffic stop by a man who had 21 prior arrests. âThe only thing we can say is maybe something is going to be learned,â Trump told reporters as he arrived, with no specifics on what needed to change; the alleged killer was charged with first degree murder as the wake went on.\n\nHouse. New Hampshire Rep. Annie Kuster announced her retirement on Wednesday, leaving a seat in the Connecticut River Valley that Biden won by 9 points. âI always said I was not going to stay in Congress forever,â said Kuster, whoâll turn 68 this year. Colin Van Ostern, who served on the stateâs five-member executive council and narrowly lost a 2016 bid for governor, was the first Democrat to rush into the primary, and retiring Gov. Chris Sununu told NHJournal that the opening gave Republicans a chance to win back the seat; thinly populated northern New Hampshire has shifted right since Kuster took office, while larger cities and suburbs have moved left. In 2022, Kuster easily won re-election after Keene Mayor George Hansel, who Sununu supported, lost the GOP primary to a more conservative candidate.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Democrat Marilyn Lands flipped a Republican-head seat in Alabamaâs state legislature â a 25-point landslide in an area that Donald Trump won by 1 point. Sheâd run and lost a race for the same seat two years earlier, but this race was contested after the stateâs abortion ban had been fully implemented, and after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that embryos created during the in vitro fertilization process had the legal rights of children. Lands talked with Americana a few hours after her win, and this is a lightly edited transcript of the conversation.\n\nAmericana: When you ran for this seat in 2022, the Dobbs decision had just come down in 2022, and the state was banning abortion. Whatâs changed since then?\n\nMarilyn Lands: Last time I ran, of course, that wasnât really part of our platform in the beginning. We were really touting health care â with my background in mental health, education, public education â and economic well-being. We really excel at economic development here, but we still have many families that are struggling. But then, when the Dobbs decision happened, people were outraged. So that became part of our messaging. This time, with the no exceptions ban, and then the IVF ruling, it was much more prominent.\n\nAmericana: What was your personal reaction to the supreme courtâs IVF decision?\n\nMarilyn Lands: I was stunned. I truly was stunned. I didnât see it coming. It feels like Alabama has become ground zero for attacks on womenâs freedoms and reproductive health care. We saw that with the abortion ban. We saw it then spread to other states.\n\nAmericana: There was a scramble by Republicans in Montgomery to pass new legislation protecting IVF. What was the effect of that on the race?\n\nMarilyn Lands: Well, I think that they did not do enough to clarify this issue. The Mobile clinic, the clinic named in the lawsuit, has still not resumed services. Weâre already hearing from families that perhaps were planning to move here and are deciding that they donât want to live in Alabama, because itâs pretty scary, if youâre wanting to build a family, that this is just not a friendly place for that.\n\nAmericana: How did your opponent try to finesse the issue on the trail?\n\nMarilyn Lands: His message was that this wasnât an issue, and that the fix that was passed in the legislature was what we needed to do. All the reproductive issues weâve been hearing about, he said he was not hearing about it from anyone. I canât imagine that, because I was hearing about it not just from Democrats, but from Republicans. They were definitely talking to me!\n\nPeople have told me that they havenât shared their story in 20 years or nobody, or that nobody their immediate family knows about their fertility issues. I think thereâs a real healthy dialogue going around all of this. And weâve had a lot of Republican support. Mike Paul, who held this seat for 20 years as a Republican, had endorsed me. A lot of my friends are Republicans, but they would tell you that they are traditional Republicans. And many Republicans were here at our watch party last night. I love that, and I also really want to get to Montgomery and build some bridges.\n\nAmericana: Why have Republicans been winning by such large margins in Alabama if their position on this is so unpopular?\n\nMarilyn Lands: I think thatâs going to end now. I think the Republicans have misread the tea leaves. We are going to see that this is just the starting place for great change. Itâs an exciting time. I think, you know, weâve sent a clear message to Alabama that the people want something different, and a message to the rest of the country that Alabama wants to move in a different direction.\n\nAmericana: What advice do you have for the Biden campaign, which has talked a lot about this and dispatched the vice president to talk about it? How do they reach Republicans who may disagree with them on 1,000 other things?\n\nMarilyn Lands: I believe we need to get to a place where we all, in Steven Covey language, seek first to understand before being understood. Weâve gotten so far away from 20 years ago, when Mike Paul first ran. I supported him. He was a Republican, we were friends and neighbors, and we really could talk to each other. And weâve lost that. And I think weâve got to all get back to that on both sides, to really understand that weâre all human beings, and weâre in this together. We are so adversarial. And we need to leave that behind and move into a new kind of community.\n\nAmericana: When Republicans push back, they often say: My Democratic opponent wants no exceptions, abortion up to birth. Did that come up in this race?\n\nMarilyn Lands: I canât say that that came up at all. Iâve talked to so many people that tell me that they are pro-life, but they donât feel that the government has a role in this. I think weâve got to reinstate Roe v. Wade , and that people donât understand some of the nuances. When the Alabama abortion law was first put on the books back in the 1800s, the word pregnant, actually, in that time, meant after you had quickened. They were trying to prevent late term abortions. They never intended to outlaw abortion. If you look at the religious aspect of it â look, not everybody believes the same way. I donât think we should impose our own religious beliefs on other people.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

The suspect, Sebastian Zapeta , even appears to fan his jacket at her on the Brooklyn subway platform.\n\nPolice arrested Zapeta, whom officials said lives at a homeless shelter in Brooklyn, at a subway station in midtown Manhattan.\n\nThe footage and images of the woman have prompted people on social media to criticize the NYPD for how officers responded to the crime. Police defended officers' response, which began when officers patrolling the Stillwell Avenue station smelled and saw smoke coming from the F train.\n\nPolice said one officer, who is visible in footage near the woman, was trying to control the crime scene as other officers tried to get fire extinguishers and summon Metropolitan Transit Authority employees. Police extinguished the flames, but the woman was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\n\"I think he did his job perfectly as his fellow officers went and got MTA workers, got fire extinguishers, and eventually were able to extinguish the individual,\" NYPD Chief of Transit Joseph Gulotta told reporters Sunday.\n\nPolice body camera images and surveillance footage were key to tracking down Zapeta, who an Immigrations and Customs Enforcement spokesperson said was in the country illegally after having been deported.\n\nThree high-school-age people identified the suspect and called police, who then apprehended him, NYPD Chief Jessica Tisch said.\n\nZapeta has been charged with murder and arson, court records show. The victim had not been identified as of Tuesday evening.\n\nZapeta appeared in a Brooklyn court Tuesday for his arraignment, where Judge Jung Park ordered that he remain in custody. His next court appearance is Friday, when he is expected to enter a plea. The three felony counts with which he has been charged all carry maximum sentences of life in prison.\n\nContributing: Reuters"

      "text": "New York's top cop quits as federal probes engulf Mayor Eric Adams\n\nNew York City's police commissioner stepped down Thursday amid separate federal corruption investigations targeting Mayor Eric Adams and his top aides.\n\nEdward Caban , the first Latino to run the New York Police Department, was asked to resign on Monday, the New York Times and other outlets reported.\n\nIn an email to the officers he led, Caban wrote that \"the news around recent developments has created a distraction for our department, and I am unwilling to let my attention be on anything other than our important work, or the safety of the men and women of the NYPD.\"\n\n\"I hold immense respect and gratitude for the brave officers who serve this department, and the NYPD deserves someone who can solely focus on protecting and serving New York City, which is why - for the good of this city and this department - I have made the difficult decision to resign as Police Commissioner,\" he said.\n\nAdams named a retired FBI veteran, Tom Donlon, as interim police commissioner. Donlon formerly led New York state's homeland security office and was chief of the FBI's National Threat Center.\n\n\"This is the first police commissioner to resign over a corruption probe since the 1970s,\" Wilbur Chapman, a former New York deputy police commissioner, told USA TODAY. \"It creates a challenge for the police rank and file to restore the confidence of the people they protect.\"\n\nOn Sept. 5, investigators from the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan seized Caban's mobile phones as part of an investigation of what local media reported was possible protection of local nightclubs from enforcement actions. The electronic devices of lower level police commanders and supervisors were also seized.\n\nCaban is among several top Adams aides and confidantes who received federal search warrants earlier this month. They include Deputy Mayor for Criminal Justice Philip Banks III, First Deputy Mayor Sheena Wright, and Schools Chancellor David Banks.\n\nPhilip Banks, a former top police official, was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in an earlier bribery scandal at the NYPD. David Banks, the city's schools' chief, is his brother, and Wright is David Banks' live-in partner. Investigators also seized the devices of a third Banks brother, Terrence Banks, who runs a government consultancy, and of Timothy Pearson, a retired police inspector who is a close confidant of the mayor's.\n\n\"Based on what I have seen, I do not believe that Mr. Banks has any criminal liability - period,\" said Benjamin Brafman, a lawyer for Philip Banks. An attorney for Terrence Banks didn't immediately return a call for comment.\n\nIn an interview with WNYC, Schools Chancellor David Banks acknowledged that federal agents had searched the home he shares with Deputy Mayor Wright. \"I have been told by my lawyers that I'm absolutely not a target in this investigation,\" he told host Brian Lehrer, \"and I'm going to do everthing I can to cooperate with the investigation.\"\n\nNo one in the mayor's circle has been charged with wrongdoing.\n\nEarlier this year, investigators seized the mayor's electronic devices, apparently in the course of an ongoing investigation of illegal Turkish funding for his 2021 mayoral campaign .\n\nCaban was first appointed in July 2023 following the resignation of his predecessor, Keechant Sewell, who served 18 months before leaving the department .\n\nIn a statement, acting Police Commissioner Donlan said he would work to \"continue the historic progress decreasing crime and removing illegal guns from our communities, uphold the highest standards of integrity and transparency, and support our dedicated officers who put their lives on the line every day to keep us safe.\""

In that key role, Tisch made headlines in 2022 when, announcing a war on rodents, she said: \"Rats don't run this city. We do.\"\n\nHer appointment was a final piece in an effort pushed by New York Gov. Kathy Hochul to clean house and stabilize the city after Adams' Sept. 26 indictment on federal bribery charges and a spate of search warrants targeting his inner circle, according to two people familiar with the matter.\n\nAdams has pleaded not guilty and goes on trial in April.\n\nIn addition to Caban, the former police commissioner, Adams' City Hall has seen the departure of two deputy mayors, the schools chancellor, two close advisors and numerous other administration and police officials, all of whom were hit with federal subpoenas in at least three corruption investigations.\n\nPrior to her tenure leading what's billed as the biggest sanitation department in the world , Tisch served as deputy police commissioner for information technology and as the citywide commissioner for information technology.

      "text": "Police departments have their eye on Google Glass\n\nPolice departments throughout the U.S. are considering whether to equip their officers with Google Glass.\n\nNew York City Police Department Commissioner Bill Bratton confirmed the department is already using the smart glasses during a press conference last week.\n\n\"We're in the process of field-testing that technology in a variety of circumstances, seeing where - if useful - where it might be most useful, most beneficial,\" he said.\n\nIn December 2013, the NYPD obtained two pairs of the glasses, Deputy Commissioner Stephen Davis said.\n\nIn an email, Davis said the department regularly takes a look at emerging technology as a potential tool for policing. Glass has not been deployed in actual patrol operations, he said.\n\nCurrently, Google Glass is only available through the Glass Explorer Program in which those who feast their eyes on Glass apply online to become a part of the project. If approved by Google, Explorers can purchase the device for $1,500.\n\nGoogle said in a statement the company did not actively approach and is not working with any law enforcement agency to offer tryouts of Google Glass.\n\n\"The Glass Explorer program includes people from all walks of life, including doctors, firefighters and parents,\" read Google's statement. \"Anyone can sign up to become a Glass Explorer. The only requirements we have is that he or she is a U.S. resident and over the age of 18.\"\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department also applied to be Google Explorers, said police Sgt. Dan Gomez, who oversees the Tactical Technology Section for LAPD.\n\n\"We are looking to see how it could work and that doesn't mean it will be used for patrol,\" he said. \"It could be used for other purposes but it's hard to say what we would do without having it,\" Gomez said.\n\nEric Farris, a police sergeant with the Byron, Ga., police department has tested Glass and said he thinks it could serve as a tool to solve investigations.\n\nCopTrax, a surveillance vendor, collaborated with the Byron police department to provide officers with Glass during routine traffic enforcement patrol, stops issuing citations, arrests and during firearms practice.\n\n\"They had the CopTrax software loaded into the Google Glass and everything recorded with Glass was then recorded back to our camera system and police cruisers,\" Farris said.\n\nThe San Francisco Police Department is in the process of outfitting its plainclothes officers with body cameras and won't rule out Glass just yet.\n\n\"We have been looking at video cameras,\" said Gordon Shyy, a public information officer at SFPD. \"I don't believe Google Glass is one of those, but we always look at any possibility with the current technology.\"\n\nShyy said that the SFPD does talk to other agencies to see whether they like the equipment they are using, but the department has yet to speak with NYPD about Glass.\n\nThe SFPD is in its final stages of giving its patrol officers Samsung Galaxy S4 smartphones, which provide officers easy access to police databases on a secure infrastructure. Shyy said the program has been extremely successful.\n\nJay Stanley, a privacy expert and senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union, said the union supports the use of police body cameras, including Glass.\n\n\"If they have the right privacy policy in place it can be a win,\" he said. \"Google Glass could protect the police and protect the citizens from abusive police practices,\" Stanley said.\n\nStanley's only concern with Glass is that the device can also display information.\n\n\"I'm not sure if people would like police to be able to go around and do facial recognition and stick labels and risk scores on them,\" he said.\n\nFollow Brandon Carte on Twitter: @brandoncarte"

Christina Ortiz, an 18-year veteran, was honored in 2022 by police brass for protecting an elderly woman who was being fleeced by a menacing con man and for solving a brother-on-brother stabbing.\n\nBut since Feb. 15, she's been forced to counter allegations in a discrimination complaint against the city filed by Lt. Emelio Rodriques and reported in a press release posted by his lawyer and in media outlets .\n\nIn his complaint which involves the 34th Precinct in Washington Heights, Rodrigues accused Ortiz of having an affair with Lt. Michael DiSanto.\n\nIn her lawsuit, Ortiz contends Rodriques discriminated against female cops in the precinct and falsely accused her because he has his own ax to grind with the NYPD.\n\n\"It's been devastating,\" the married mom of three said. \"I have to defend myself on something that's a lie. It has affected my pension, my position, and my image on this job, and anything after this job.\"\n\nOrtiz, whose husband is also an NYPD sergeant, says she hasn't even seen or worked with Rodriques since February 2024, when she transferred to the Internal Affairs Bureau , she alleges, to get away from Rodriques.\n\nOne day after she saw his claims, she was so angry she sat down and wrote a 2,252-word complaint against Rodriques and filed it with the NYPD.\n\n\"These allegations have no basis to them nor are they true,\" she wrote. \"I have been publicly humiliated by this man for no reason. I hope that in some way this wrong can be made right.\"\n\nA lawsuit for defamation - or a false statement that is published that causes harm - filed by one cop against another cop is so rare that neither Ortiz's lawyer John Scola nor other attorneys who represent cops could recall another instance.\n\nScola's suit alleges \"defamation per se,\" meaning the statement was so inherently harmful the plaintiff does not need to prove damages. The legal term covers four areas, and Scola says Rodriques' complaint violates two - falsely accusing someone of sexual misconduct and falsely saying something harmful to a person's job.\n\n\"When a supervisor weaponizes discrimination complaints to cover their own failures, the real victims within the NYPD suffer,\" Scola said.\n\nThe city is also a defendant in the case for retaliation and creating a hostile work environment.\n\nRodriques' lawyer Eric Sanders said in a statement his client \"unequivocally stands by his allegations.\"\n\n\"This is nothing more than a legally baseless attempt to intimidate and silence a whistleblower who dared to challenge the status quo,\" he said, adding he will seek legal remedies against Ortiz and her lawyer.\n\nScola countered, \"The only person weaponizing the justice system in this case is Lt. Rodriques. Neither Sergeant Ortiz nor I take his hollow threats, or those of his counsel, seriously.\"\n\nRodriques, a 23-year veteran, arrived at the 34th Precinct in January 2023. In 2011, Rodriques lost 35 vacation days for failing to respond to radio runs involving weapons, and failing to supervise his cops, records show.\n\nTension soon developed between Ortiz and Rodriques over his treatment of female cops, according to her complaint.\n\nThe suit alleges Rodriques began assigning overtime to a pregnant sergeant who needed to work day tours so she could be home in the evenings.\n\nHe ordered another female cop to work overtime, even though she needed a stable schedule as a single mother with a 9-year-old son, the lawsuit claims. When Ortiz complained, he allegedly said, \"I do not give a s-t.\"\n\nIn June 2023, he tried to change Ortiz's tour and later tried to cut her overtime, she alleges.\n\nWomen are \"to be seen and not heard,\" he told her at one point, the suit claims.\n\nIn both cases, she complained to Lt. Michael DiSanto and the order was overridden, according to the complaint.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges Rodriques then started false rumors that Ortiz and DiSanto were romantically involved and also that she was a lesbian.\n\nIn early 2024, Ortiz decided to accept a transfer to Internal Affairs to get away from Rodriques, the lawsuit claims. The move cost her a large amount in overtime because IAB overtime is capped, the suit said.\n\n\"Sgt. Ortiz faced such relentless harassment from Lt. Rodriques that she had no choice but to leave her position in the 34, forfeiting hundreds of thousands of dollars in income just to escape,\" Scola said.\n\nThe move also meant her pension would be reduced, the suit estimates, by $30,000 a year or $1.1 million across her lifetime.\n\n\"I find it unjust and disturbing that the NYPD would keep a man, who has had multiple complaints in every precinct he's ever worked in, where he's constantly harassing and belittling women,\" she wrote.\n\nOrtiz expects to be interviewed by Internal Affairs, which is conducting an investigation. Rodriques was transferred out of the 34 in August to the Manhattan Court Section."

      "text": "The NYPD Is Sending Drones to the Sites of 9-1-1 Calls\n\nManage your account\n\nThe New York City Police Department (NYPD) is now sending drones out on 9-1-1 calls to do the business that their Candy Crush-addicted human officers are too busy to tackle - and surveilling everyone in sight while they do it.\n\nAs the cybersecurity news site The Record reports , these \"drones as first responders\" - or DFRs, as the NYPD calls them - can fly up to 45 miles per hour, filming everything on the block with telephoto cameras that can, per manufacturer Skydio , identify faces and license plates from nearly a mile away.\n\nLaunched last year as part of embattled mayor Eric Adams ' quest to shove technology into everything regardless of public opinion , these drones were initially only going to respond to \"select priority public safety calls,\" according to a press release issued last November that formally announced the program.\n\nAs The Record notes, however, the NYPD's definition of \"select priority\" seems awfully vague - and it doesn't actually report how many drones are deployed on police calls, either.\n\nPrior to the program's official launch, the department revealed that they planned to use drones to monitor house parties that receive noise complaints over Labor Day Weekend in 2023, which also coincides with J'Ouvert festivities that take place in New York's Caribbean communities. In fact, that festival was cited specifically by a former NYPD commissioner who called the drones a \" wonderful thing .\"\n\nIf shelling out for party-surveilling drones seems to you like a misuse of taxpayer funds, you're not alone. In an interview with The Guardian in 2023, a senior strategist at the New York Civil Liberties Union called the NYPD's drone usage \"dystopian\" and a form of \"racialized discrimination.\"\n\nNow that their use has been expanded to do more than just allowing cops to be remote spectators at peoples' backyard parties, those epithets feel prescient.\n\nBecause the US Supreme Court has ruled that law enforcement can legally surveil anyone's outdoor property without a warrant via drone, the NYPD has followed suit. Per NYPD policy, drones aren't allowed to operate inside a property warrantless, but outside doesn't count, basically.\n\nAs constitutional rights lawyer Sidney Thaxter told The Record , that means the NYPD could film someone in their backyard - and because the department's Skydio drones are equipped with telephoto lenses , they could do so from a high enough altitude that anyone who wasn't looking at the sky wouldn't notice the lurking aircraft.\n\n\"They can set a drone up in the air far enough away that you can't hear it,\" Thaxter said, \"and they can zoom in and can literally see what's in your hands.\"\n\nWhile we don't know exactly how often the NYPD is using their drones, the department has already bragged about deploying them to help them surveil protests and the people demonstrating at them in recent years. After protests erupted across the city in response to the conflict in Gaza, police boasted to the press that they'd used drones 13 times to make a whopping 239 arrests - all in a single week, and all in Brooklyn.\n\n\"We got the whole thing on video,\" assistant NYPD commissioner Kaz Daughtry said, referring to pro-Palestinian protesters who were caught on video throwing eggs and bottles at cops during an October 2021 demonstration in South Brooklyn. \"We'll be turning that evidence over to the Brooklyn DA's office to help enhance the arrests.\"\n\nAmid a larger culture of crackdowns on freedom of speech in New York and around the country, this kind of drone use does indeed feel dystopian - or, as Albert Fox Cahn of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project put it to The Record , as if the NYPD was treating \"Black Mirror\" as an \"instruction manual.\"\n\nMore on NYPD tech: AI Completely Failed to Catch CEO Killer, With Cops Instead Relying on Random McDonald's Employee"

I think she wins.\"\n\nDuring a chat with the Daily Mail , S-Quire described Mercado as a \"friend\" and \"associate,\" saying he connected with her through the video's producer, Picture Perfect.\n\nAccording to S-Quire, the detective volunteered to participate in the project, which was filmed in early 2022 at Club Vanity, a gentlemen's club in Queens.\n\nThe producer had connections with the club's owner, allowing them to shoot on location for free before business hours. The entire shoot lasted about three and a half hours.\n\n\"She just wanted to help me out with the video, help me get my vision out,'\" S-Quire explained. \"I just thought she had a great look.\"\n\nAccording to the news outlet, S-Quire said he only knew Mercado by her nickname, Honeybee, the same name she uses on social media.\n\n\"I didn't know what she did for a living,\" he admitted, laughing. \"She doesn't seem like a detective. When you think of detectives, you think of Special Victims Unit on the TV.\"\n\nDespite her sultry on-screen persona, he described the detective as \"cool and laid back,\" adding that she is \"just a regular, down-to-earth human being.\"\n\nS-Quire admitted he was caught off guard by the video's sudden popularity and believes Mercado was equally unprepared for the viral attention.\n\n\"I think she thought the video wasn't going to go anywhere,\" he said. \"This is just one of those things.\"\n\nWeighing in on the now-viral video, which has racked up over 1.6 million views, retired NYPD Special Victims Division Chief Michael Osgood called it especially troubling for a detective handling sex crimes to appear in content that objectifies women.\n\n\"I think this conduct is unbecoming a police officer,\" Osgood said. \"I find it wrong morally if you're a special victims detective.\"\n\nRetired police officer and attorney Eric Sanders also believes Mercado should face consequences.\n\n\"She should be modified,\" he argued. \"What she did is inconsistent with the values of being a police officer. Police work is a noble profession, and it's supposed to look a certain way.\"\n\nAnother NYPD officer, who spoke with the Daily Mail , expressed disappointment over Mercado's involvement in the music video, calling it an embarrassment to the force.\n\n\"I really don't understand why this woman would do something that dumb,\" a detective told the news outlet . \"We are supposed to be held to a higher standard as role models.\""

That's especially true, he says, after the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020 and the killing of Tyre Nichols at the hands of five Memphis police officers in January.\n\nThe NYPD has been the nation's foremost laboratory of police reform. So as the country wrestles with how best to find ways forward on policing, New York stands out as a crucial case study.\n\nWielding the power of the state and given the duty to enforce its laws, police officers have a responsibility like few others in society, he says. It's one of the reasons he now teaches his students the fundamentals of criminal investigation and the use of force, emphasizing the importance of training, professionalism, and accountability.\n\n\"When I look at the Derek Chauvin case [in Minneapolis], and now looking at the Memphis videos, the first thing that stands clear in my mind is: no supervision,\" says Mr. Giacalone, now an adjunct professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. \"There's no supervisor on the scene in either case. Now, would a supervisor have prevented this? I believe so, because something went inherently wrong with these individuals.\"\n\n\"And I would say none of it had to do with their training, because no one is trained to do the things they did,\" he says. \"It's about supervision. It's about accountability.\"\n\nWith some 36,000 officers, the NYPD is the largest police force in the world, and the most influential department in the United States. In many respects, too, the NYPD has been the standard-bearer of tactical innovation and management reforms over the past three decades. It has been the nation's foremost laboratory of police reform. So as the country wrestles with how best to find ways forward on policing, New York stands out as a crucial case study. To understand the past 30 years is to begin to understand how policing has gone right and how it has gone wrong.\n\n\"The NYPD does kind of stand out as an exemplar among American police departments, specifically within the American policing community,\" says Jorge Camacho, policy director of the Justice Collaboratory at Yale Law School and a former assistant district attorney in Manhattan. \"By and large, NYPD officers are better trained than most officers in most other jurisdictions. They do have more oversight over them. Not to say that it's perfect oversight. They just have more.\"\n\nWhen it comes to the reform of American policing, however, the idea of accountability remains one of the most bitterly contested. Mr. Giacalone and other experts see it as an essential value of management and professionalism.\n\nBut others see an inherent flaw - one that, at its worst, leads to the killing of Americans. How can police, in effect, police themselves and punish their own? And is this a matter of \"a few bad apples,\" or are the current structures of police training and accountability deeply flawed?\n\n\"We've seen time and time again how routine police stops have ended tragically,\" says Alexa Avilés, a member of the New York City Council, speaking at a rally in front of City Hall calling for the NYPD to provide more data about its day-to-day methods and interactions with people on the street. \"When is enough ever going to be enough? ... We want to know, with taxpayer dollars, are they doing the job that we are trusting them to do in the public?\"\n\nCouncilwoman Avilés' call for rigorous public transparency includes a fundamental opposition to one of the NYPD's paradigm-shifting tactical innovations, begun 30 years ago: the relentless and data-driven focus on the city's most crime-ridden neighborhoods.\n\nMr. Giacalone's career with the NYPD, most of which he served as a supervising sergeant, spanned that era. In the early 1990s, when he was a rookie cop, the \"mean streets\" era of New York was reaching its ignominious peak: There were around 2,000 murders each year, and violent crime and armed robberies were reaching all-time highs.\n\nThe year he fired his weapon at a suspect was also one of the most transformative years in the history of the NYPD - and perhaps in the history of American policing. In 1994, the NYPD launched CompStat, short for \"comparison statistics,\" and started to pioneer the methods of data-driven policing.\n\nIt was also the time when the department began to reorganize the kinds of special anti-crime teams that would influence those like Memphis's now-disbanded SCORPION unit. Instead of solving crimes that already happened, police would work to prevent them. Using techniques like stop and frisk, traffic stops, and minor violations like loitering and littering, the department would focus laserlike on getting illegal guns off the streets.\n\nMr. Giacalone says it was also around that time that the NYPD began to revamp its own systems of accountability, including for officer-involved shootings, which were happening hundreds of times per year. In the early 1970s, officers discharged their firearms almost 1,000 times annually.\n\nIn 1994, when Mr. Giacalone fired his .38 revolver at a suspect, it was one of 331 officer-involved shootings, according to NYPD data . That year, some 29 people were killed.\n\nHe and his partner responded to a report of a disturbance at a Bronx warehouse. An armed robbery was in progress: A crew from Brooklyn was attempting a heist of cable boxes.\n\n\"When we walked into the door of the place - it was into, like, a garage area - there was a break from the sun into this dark garage, so it took a second for your eyes to kind of adjust,\" says Mr. Giacalone, who was responsible for the actions of 10 officers under him during his years as a sergeant. \"But there was a guy with a gun, tying someone's arms,\" he says. The suspect immediately started shooting at them.\n\nMr. Giacalone says his NYPD training immediately kicked in. \"Cover and concealment is something ingrained in your head, so that when you hear shots, you react,\" he says. \"You don't even think about it.\" He and his partner both dived behind a nearby van and returned fire. Then they \"waited for the cavalry to arrive,\" he says.\n\nIn the end, no one was shot or injured. Specialized units arrived, including hostage negotiators and canine units, and the suspects surrendered. They were eventually convicted and sent to prison.\n\nOfficers put their lives on the line every day, he says. Any routine call can suddenly turn into a life-or-death situation, a fact that makes policing a different kind of profession.\n\nBut 1994 was also the year in which crime began to fall dramatically, beginning what criminologists call \"the great crime decline\" of the past three decades. Murders in New York City fell from a peak of 2,262 in 1990 to just 292 in 2017, the fewest in the city's history and an astonishing 88% drop. Since then the number of murders in NYC jumped to 438 in 2022 - a record short-term increase, but still 80% lower than in the early 1990s.\n\nThe number of officer-involved shootings also fell dramatically. In 2017, on-duty NYPD officers discharged their firearms 37 times, killing nine people. In 2022, there were 48 police shootings, in which 11 people lost their lives.\n\nAfter he fired his gun, Mr. Giacalone immediately entered what could be called a protocol of accountability. Internal Affairs officers took his .38 revolver and inspected it. He and his partner were informed of their rights under General Order 15, a kind of Miranda rights for police, which gives them 48 hours to consult with an attorney before giving a statement.\n\n\"We didn't need a lawyer, as far as I was concerned,\" says Mr. Giacalone. \"We had a union delegate there, and we just told our story.\"\n\nIn early February, Samy Feliz stands in front of New York's City Hall, demanding accountability for the NYPD officers who shot and killed his brother 3 1/2 years ago.\n\nHis brother, Allan Feliz, had been pulled over during a routine traffic stop in Washington Heights for what police say was a failure to wear a seat belt - a fact the Feliz family and its lawyer dispute after analyzing the three videos of the shooting , including police body camera footage and a bystander video.\n\nThe passengers in the car can be heard saying they were wearing seat belts. When the officers ran his brother's ID, they found he had three outstanding warrants for tickets, including one for littering.\n\nAccording to the videos, an altercation ensued, and police shocked Mr. Feliz's brother with a stun gun. As one officer struggled with him in the front seat, the father of a 6-month-old can be heard yelling, \"Don't shoot me, don't shoot me!\" During the struggle, the car moved forward slowly, and then backward. Police say the brother, who served five years in prison for burglary, was trying to get away. The family says it was the police who caused the car to move during the struggle. One of the officers, a supervising sergeant, then fatally shot Mr. Feliz in the chest. As officers dragged him feet-first from the car, his pants and underwear were pulled down.\n\n\"This kind of disrespect and violence is the rule, not the exception,\" says Samy Feliz, holding a picture of his brother in front of him as he recounts how Allan was shot and killed in the middle of an October afternoon, just as schools were letting out. Officers \"yanked his body out of the car, exposing his genitals and leaving him, at 3 in the afternoon, for the world to see - kids walking home from school.\"\n\nFor Mr. Feliz and about 50 others who have gathered in front of City Hall, the NYPD's tactical innovations and the astonishing drop in violent crime and police shootings in New York have come with a terrible cost for the Black and Latino communities that have borne its relentless focus on high-crime neighborhoods: the number of young men who have been shot and killed.\n\n\"The vast majority of the time it's just a few horrific stories of police killings that make it into the news,\" says Gabby Cuesta, a leader in a coalition of civic groups and family members of those killed by police called Citizens United for Police Reform. \"What this fails to show is that police killings are just the tip of the iceberg. ... [There are] thousands of examples of daily violence experienced by members of Black, Latinx, and other communities of color in New York City because of constant, disparate low-level enforcement and broken-windows policing that does not keep us safe.\"\n\nIn some ways, the genesis of the coalition was after the fatal shooting of Amadou Diallo in 1999. A cadre of plainclothes officers called the Street Crime Unit, whose stated motto was \"We own the night,\" approached the student from Guinea, who was returning to his apartment in the early morning hours. When Mr. Diallo reached for his wallet, the four officers opened fire, shooting 41 rounds, 19 of which struck and killed the 23-year-old immigrant.\n\nThe NYPD did not discipline the officers, and they were acquitted of murder. But the department disbanded the unit.\n\nIt was in many ways the first of what became a national focus on police shootings. At the same time, however, activists and others began to scrutinize the NYPD's tactics, including its growing emphasis on stops and frisks.\n\nIn 2001, the City Council passed legislation requiring the NYPD to provide its data on these stops - which proved to be one of the most momentous reforms for police accountability. The department's own data revealed that police were stopping hundreds of thousands people each year, and about 85% were Black and Latino men. All it took was a \"furtive glance\" to justify a body search.\n\nIn 2012, groups that were part of the Citizens United for Police Reform coalition filed a successful lawsuit against the NYPD. In 2014, a federal judge ruled the NYPD's stop and frisk practices violated the Constitution, illegally profiling people of color and violating the standards for \"reasonable suspicion,\" the threshold for conducting a search. The judge placed the NYPD under a federal monitorship, which continues today.\n\n\"While that was a huge win after years and years of organizing, the abuse continues,\" says Samah Sisay, staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights, which filed the successful federal lawsuit. \"We know stop and frisk is still a reality in the city and the ways implemented? What we saw in the racial disparities that continue, are causing immense harm.\"\n\nIn 2021, there were almost 9,000 stops and frisks, according to NYPD data, and 87% were of Black or Latino people.\n\nThe purpose of the rally in front of City Hall, in fact, was to call for passage of the How Many Stops Act, which would require the NYPD to provide the same kind of data for lower-level stops , including searches with consent. Data like this helped prove that the NYPD's practices were unconstitutional, so activists hope to use it to continue to expose what is happening in their communities.\n\n\"These bills are going to bring critical and urgent transparency to the NYPD daily activities in our community,\" says Ms. Cuesta. \"Right now, the NYPD is only required to report on what we know as stop and frisk. That leaves the vast majority of encounters unreported.\"\n\nCommunity members, too, are concerned that Mayor Eric Adams has relaunched the kind of street crime units of the past as the city is experiencing a record increase in violent crime coming out of the pandemic.\n\nAfter the Memphis Police Department disbanded its SCORPION unit after the killing of Mr. Nichols, Mr. Adams defended the efficacy of the technique, and the kinds of reforms the NYPD has put in place.\n\nNow known as the Neighborhood Safety Teams, they are not completely a plainclothes unit, but wear identifying markings. Mayor Adams has touted its new methods of training, including de-escalation techniques, robust oversight, and a selection of officers who will not, he's said , perpetuate \"the abuses that we witnessed in the past.\"\n\n\"Many people stated that we should not do it, but we were able to remove 7,000 guns off our streets; that's a 27-year high,\" he told CNN. \"A combination of body camera footage is crucial, having the right supervision there, that can immediately de-escalate the situation or stop when it gets out of hand, and pick the right officers assigned. Just because you are a police officer does not mean that you are capable of doing every aspect of policing.\"\n\nThe department also now provides a public database that allows users to view the records of NYPD misconduct allegations. Activists won another major victory for transparency in 2020 after New York repealed its Civil Rights Law 50-a, which long shielded the disciplinary records of NYPD officers from public view.\n\nMike Hayes, an investigative journalist who has long had \"an obsession with disciplinary records,\" remains skeptical. He says the administration of the database is \"half-baked,\" noting that a number of officer records he's obtained are missing from the database.\n\n\"When the mayor talks about how last year the NYPD pulled 7,000 guns off the street, that is something that should absolutely be commended and is definitely a stat that you like to see,\" says Mr. Hayes, author of \"The Secret Files: Bill de Blasio, the NYPD, and the Broken Promises of Police Reform.\"\n\n\"But I'll push back on that and say, 'Tell us how many of these guns were taken off the street by Neighborhood Safety Teams officers. Where are they operating?'\" he says. \"And as we sit here today, we don't know who these officers are. That information has not been put out there in a very transparent way.\"\n\nMr. Feliz, whose family has filed a wrongful death suit against the NYPD and is still waiting for the findings of the Citizens Complaint Review Board, says he continues to be profiled in his neighborhood and stopped by police for no reason.\n\n\"I can be waiting for a table outside of a restaurant, and I have a Neighborhood Safety Team officer asking me, 'What's going on? What are you doing?'\" he says. \"They asked me if I had anything on me, so I allowed them to conduct their search. Why? Because the entire time I'm having this experience with this officer, he has his hands on his holster and his gun like John Wayne.\"\n\n\"That's an intimidation tactic; that's a coercion for me to allow him to check me,\" Mr. Feliz continues, describing the kinds of lower-level stops that are not currently part of the public record. \"That's not anything that makes me as a New Yorker feel safe or reassured. ... It's not a problem with 'a few bad apples'; it's a systematic lack of transparency and accountability.\"\n\nEditor's note: The number of murders in New York City in 2022 has been corrected.

The man was berated and pushed to the ground. In another video, a cyclist refuses to show identification and ends up being punched four times in the face by an officer while another watches on the side, thumbs hooked in his belt loop.\n\nSometimes officers even go as far as initiating these altercations, the report says, adding that officers are \"not only missing opportunities to de-escalate, but are sometimes actively escalating situations with members of the public.\"\n\nThe inspector general's analysis found that between 2010 and 2014, 37 out of 104 officers in excessive force cases were not punished by the police agency.\n\n\"In a number of cases, the department has failed to meet its fundamental obligation to police itself,\" the report says.\n\nThe IG suggests that NYPD amend its patrol guide to reflect more concrete rules on how and when to use force, as well as strengthen its disciplinary measures to better hold officers accountable for breaking force guidelines. Additionally, the report recommends more training on how to avoid violent confrontations.\n\nNYPD has been under intense scrutiny this past year, after the filmed arrest and killing of Eric Garner. In July 2014, a bystander captured police officers accusing the un-armed 43-year-old man of selling untaxed cigarettes and subsequently using a chokehold, which caused his death.\n\nAs The Christian Science Monitor reported, the incident and subsequent high-profile killings of black men by white police officers in major cities around the United States has fostered a general sense of disillusionment around the nation:\n\nIndeed, the year witnessed widespread civil unrest and a protest movement perhaps not seen since the civil rights era. It also began a year of bipartisan soul-searching as many began to contemplate the long, troubled history between law enforcement and the nation's minority communities, and what needs to be done as the nation moves forward.\n\n\"There's a new national awareness and movement about racial bias and policing, and this is a very good development,\" says Harry Levine, professor of sociology at Queens College who studies the arrest patterns of the NYPD. \"I think one of the most powerful forces affecting New York City and its police department is this growing awareness in the rest of America - it's the policing equivalent of the Confederate flag.\"\n\nAlthough NYPD did not immediately respond to the report, officials have said various reforms and training initiatives are under implementation in order to address the criticism American police have received.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

The New York City Council overrode Mayor Eric Adams' veto of the bill Jan. 30.\n\nLoading...\n\nJan. 31, 2024, 11:25 a.m. ET\n\nNew York City police officers will be required to record the apparent race, gender, and ages of most people they stop for questioning under a law passed Jan. 30 by the City Council, which overrode a veto by Mayor Eric Adams.\n\nThe issue was thrust into the national spotlight in recent days when NYPD officers pulled over a Black council member without giving him a reason.\n\nThe law gives police reform advocates a major win in requiring the nation's largest police department and its 36,000 officers to document all investigative encounters in a city that once had officers routinely stop and frisk huge numbers of men for weapons - a strategy that took a heavy toll on communities of color.\n\nSince 2001, NYPD officers have been required to document instances in which they have asked someone \"accusatory\" questions as part of an investigation, detain, or search someone or arrest them.\n\nBut the new law requires officers to document basic information in low-level encounters, where police ask for information from people who aren't necessarily suspected of a crime. Officers also will have to report the circumstances that led to stopping a particular person. The data would be made public on the police department's website.\n\nCity Council Member Kevin Riley, a Bronx Democrat who is Black, was among the council members who conveyed how many New Yorkers of color dread interacting with police on the street as he voted in favor of the measure.\n\n\"When we see those red and blue lights, our hearts drop into our stomachs,\" he said.\n\nNew York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, who sponsored the bill, said that reporting the encounters could be done in less than a minute on an officer's smartphone through the system already in place.\n\n\"This is not about preventing police work,\" Mr. Williams said. \"This is police work.\"\n\nThe mayor, a Democrat and former police captain, on Jan. 30 argued that in police work, minutes and seconds could be the difference between life and death.\n\n\"These bills will make New Yorkers less safe on the streets, while police officers are forced to fill out additional paperwork rather than focus on helping New Yorkers and strengthening community bonds,\" he said in a statement after the vote, in which the council cleared the bar of two-thirds support needed to override the veto with 42 in favor and nine against.\n\nThe department's largest police officers' union, in a statement after the vote, warned that the council would have to answer to constituents for \"rising 911 response times and diminished police presence\" in city neighborhoods.\n\n\"New York City police officers will comply with the new law and do the job the way the City Council wants it done,\" said Patrick Hendry, president of the Police Benevolent Association. \"Despite the increased workload and the NYPD's critically low staffing levels, we will continue to protect our communities to the best of our ability.\"\n\nCouncil Speaker Adrienne Adams, a Democrat who is not related to the mayor, said police and other opponents were exaggerating how much of a burden the new requirements would be. The law doesn't require officers to document casual conversations, such as providing directions, which are explicitly exempt under the requirements, she stressed.\n\n\"There should not be resistance to telling people who is being stopped in this city and why,\" she said.\n\nRepublicans, by far the minority on the council, suggested the bill only served to further racial divisions in the city.\n\n\"Please don't make this a racial issue. It isn't,\" Council Member Vickie Paladino, a Queens Republican who is white, said after a number of her council peers spoke strongly in favor of the bill, with some even speaking in Spanish, Portuguese, Mandarin, and Haitian Creole.\n\n\"We didn't make this a race thing. This is a race thing,\" responded Mr. Riley as he related his own experience of being detained by police simply for hunting for a parking spot in Manhattan while fresh out of college.\n\nOthers noted that Feb. 4 marks the 25th anniversary of when a young, unarmed Black immigrant named Amadou Diallo was shot dozens of times by NYPD officers in the Bronx.\n\nIn 2013, a federal judge ruled that the NYPD violated the civil rights of Black and Hispanic residents with its stop-and-frisk tactic. Since then, the department has reported a large decline in such encounters, though an ACLU report found people of color were still the targets of the vast majority of stop-and-frisks in 2022.\n\nThe Jan. 30 vote came after Mr. Adams and the NYPD launched a last-ditch effort to peel off some supporters from the measure by hosting police ride-alongs for council members.\n\nBut the Jan. 26 event was overshadowed that same evening when an officer pulled over Council Member Yusef Salaam, an exonerated member of the \"Central Park Five\" who with four other Black and Latino men were falsely accused and convicted of raping a white jogger in Central Park in 1989. Their convictions were eventually overturned through DNA evidence.\n\nIn the very brief encounter, an officer asked Mr. Salaam to roll down his windows and identify himself. Mr. Salaam told the officer he was on the City Council and asked why he was pulled over, according to audio of the encounter published by The New York Times.\n\nThe officer told Mr. Salaam, \"Oh, OK. Have a good one\" before walking away, body camera footage showed. The NYPD later released a statement that said Mr. Salaam was pulled over for driving with dark window tints beyond the legal limit.\n\nThough such a stop would not be covered by the transparency law - police already have to record information when they pull a driver over - Mr. Salaam argued that it showed the need for greater police transparency.\n\nThe council on Jan. 30 also overrode Mr. Adams' veto of a bill that would restrict the use of solitary confinement in the city's jails.\n\nThe law places a four-hour limit on isolating inmates who pose an immediate risk of violence to others or themselves in \"de-escalation\" units. Only those involved in violent incidents could be placed in longer-term restrictive housing, and they would need to be allowed out of their cells for 14 hours each day and get access to the same programming available to other inmates.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

He also cited concerns raised by a federal monitor appointed to evaluate operations at the city's jails.\n\nThis story was reported by The Associated Press.

Are movements like Black Lives Matter inherently anti-police?\n\nLoading...\n\nUpdated Oct. 26, 2015, 11:55 p.m. ET\n\nTo filmmaker Quentin Tarantino, it may have felt like awkward timing. But for his critics, it was a deeply insensitive act.\n\nThe New York City Police Department's union is demanding a boycott of his films after the Academy Award-winning director participated in a local protest against police brutality only days after an officer was killed by a suspect.\n\n\"It's no surprise that someone who makes a living glorifying crime and violence is a cop-hater, too. The police officers that Quentin Tarantino calls 'murderers' aren't living in one of his depraved big screen fantasies - they're risking and sometimes sacrificing their lives to protect communities from real crime and mayhem,\" said union president Patrick J. Lynch, in a statement.\n\n\"New Yorkers need to send a message to this purveyor of degeneracy that he has no business coming to our city to peddle his slanderous 'Cop Fiction',\" he said.\n\nMr. Tarantino flew in from California to speak at the demonstration that was organized by the group #RiseUpOctober, which aims to bring justice to those they say have been mistreated by law enforcement.\n\nBut the demonstration came on the heels of tragedy. On Tuesday, NYPD Officer Randolph Holder was shot and killed by a suspect while in pursuit.\n\nMr. Tarantino told The New York Post , \"It's like this: It's unfortunate timing, but we've flown in all these families to go and tell their stories . . . That cop that was killed, that's a tragedy, too.\"\n\nGiven the timing, was the demonstration innately anti-police?\n\nChris Christie might say so. In an interview on CBS's Face the Nation Sunday, the New Jersey governor and Republican presidential candidate said the Black Lives Matter movement advocates for the killing of police.\n\n\"I don't believe that movement should be calling for the murder of police officers,\" said Governor Christie in a critique of the president's support for the movement. \"They've been chanting in the streets for the murder of police officers.\"\n\nActually, very few Black Lives Matter participants advocate killing police. But the movement's sharp criticism of law enforcement has led many to share Christie's sentiments. But is that really the case?\n\nCampaign Zero is a package of policy proposals conceived by activists participating in the wider movement against problematic policing. It calls for ceasing so-called broken window policing, limiting use of force by police, demilitarizing police departments, implementing body cameras, increasing community oversight and establishing community representation in police departments, improving police training, and rewriting union contracts to ensure more effective oversight of misconduct investigations, among other reforms.\n\nWriting for Vox, German Lopez argued that many of these demands are feasible and non-controversial:\n\nThe policy proposals are fairly reasonable. As much as this is a wish list for the Black Lives Matter movement, it's also a list of proposals that I have personally heard and seen from criminal justice experts over the past year - including the President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing . Nothing in the list stuck out as particularly surprising, shocking, or unfeasible to me - although police advocates will certainly argue that some of the ideas, such as a higher legal standard for allowing use of force, could endanger officers' lives.\n\nFor one, body cameras have proven to be beneficial to both officers and civilians , though some unions have tried to block the use of them .\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Mr. Brinsley killed himself shortly after the shootings.\n\nThe shootings further jarred an already emotional standoff between de Blasio and the NYPD over the death of State Island man Eric Garner and the refusal by a grand jury to indict Officer Daniel Pantaleo.\n\nDe Blasio has angered the rank and file by sitting next to controversial civil rights advocate Rev. Al Sharpton during meetings and by comments he made to his biracial son, Dante, that he should take \"special care\" around police officers.\n\nMoreover, de Blasio called the grand jury decision \"a national moment of grief ... [and] pain.\" He continued: \"We are dealing with centuries of racism that have brought us to this day. That is how profound the crisis is.\"\n\nPolice union officials say such comments by de Blasio have helped foster an anti-police atmosphere. One union head, Pat Lynch, said the mayor had \"blood on his hands\" after the deaths of Ramos and Liu.\n\nBut the funeral protest, which police say was impromptu and involved a few hundred out of thousands present, also struck a discordant note with the American public, Bratton said in his memo.\n\n\"All officers were painted by [an act of disrespect], and it stole the valor, honor and attention that rightfully belonged to the memory of detective Rafael Ramos's life and service,\" Bratton wrote. \"That was not the intent, I know. But it was the result.\"\n\nReaction among officers to Bratton's missive was mixed. Ed Mullins, who is head of the Sergeants Benevolent Association, told the New York Post : \"I remind my members of their First Amendment rights of expression. It's your choice. Choose what makes sense to you.\"\n\nNYPD Captains Endowment Association president Roy Richter urged cops to heed Bratton's words - to a point.\n\nAt a funeral, \"the appropriate protest is not ... turning away from mourners ... but rather cold, steely silence,\" he told the Post.\n\nThe comments underscore just how personal the national debate over police conduct has become in New York City.\n\nIn fact, the back and forth between police and City Hall has moved beyond rhetoric and into how the city is being policed.\n\nThe number of arrests in the city plummeted by 66 percent after the Dec. 20 shooting of Officers Ramos and Liu. Enforcement for low-level offenses, such as traffic citations, parking tickets, and public drinking and urination, had dropped by 92 to 94 percent.\n\nSome officers told the New York Post that the slowdown was tied to a feeling of betrayal by de Blasio and concerns for their own safety.\n\nAn emergency meeting between de Blasio and five union presidents did not result in any immediate de-escalation of tensions.\n\nThe protests, taken together with the work slowdown, have deepened a debate that touches as much on police tactics as institutional biases around race and class.\n\nIndeed, the slowdown in particular offers an ironic twist, writes Matt Taibbi in Rolling Stone , on \"a highly specific debate over a very resolvable controversy not about police as people, but about how police are deployed.\"\n\nThe actions by some NYPD officers cut to some of the central dilemmas around so-called quality-of-life, or broken windows, policing, especially given how police, critics contend, are often asked to carry out anti-crime policies where residents of poor, minority neighborhoods take the brunt.\n\n\"Most people, and police most of all, agree that the best use of police officers is police work,\" writes Mr. Taibbi. Police officers \"shouldn't be collecting backdoor taxes [such as parking violations] because politicians are too cowardly to raise them, and they shouldn't be preemptively busting people in poor neighborhoods because voters don't have the patience to figure out some other way to deal with our dying cities.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Police relations with the city's minority communities have been especially strained since an apparent chokehold death in July.\n\nLoading...\n\nUpdated Sept. 08, 2014, 6:45 p.m. ET | New York\n\nThe New York City Police Department outlined a new tactical training program on Monday as the administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio continues its efforts to mend the fractured relationship between the nation's largest police force and the city's minority communities.\n\nSpeaking before the New York City Council Monday morning, police Commissioner William Bratton told lawmakers that for the first time in the city's history, the NYPD would begin requiring its officers to undergo additional tactical training each year - \"refresher courses\" with a renewed focus on de-escalating encounters and treating citizens with respect, even during arrests.\n\n\"The verbal and physical tactics necessary to assess and control a situation are perishable skills,\" Mr. Bratton said. \"We cannot reasonably expect police officers to maintain those skills on the basis of the training they receive as academy recruits, without regular refreshers to keep them current and sharp.\"\n\nThe announcement of the department's new annual \"in service\" training comes less than two months after Eric Garner, a 350-pound black man, died allegedly at the hands of New York police. Mr. Garner, who resisted arrest, was subdued in an apparent chokehold that has been banned by police policy since 1993.\n\nThe arrest was vividly captured by bystanders' smart-phone videos and led to another summer of simmering tensions between the NYPD and the city's black and Latino residents.\n\nThe tension in New York became more acute a few weeks after Garner's death, too, following the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. That death roiled the nation and put a spotlight on police tactics in minority neighborhoods around the country.\n\nBut NYPD officials on Monday said their new training efforts - which will begin as a limited pilot program in November - would attempt to build \"legitimacy\" between police officers and the communities they protect.\n\nOne aim, Deputy Commissioner of Training Benjamin Tucker told city council members, is to \"get our officers to understand that how they treat the public in their encounters on the street makes a huge difference in how and whether the public leaves that encounter ... [feeling] as though they've been respected.\"\n\nCitizens who encounter police, whether during a \"stop and frisk,\" a \"for cause\" arrest, or even just the isuing of a summons, should feel that \"they leave that encounter with their dignity,\" Mr. Tucker said.\n\nA year ago, a federal judge found that the city's aggressive use of stop-and-frisk, a permissible tactic under certain conditions, violated the US Constitution and illegally targeted minorities .\n\nThe controversy last summer helped propel Mr. de Blasio, a little-known middling candidate at the time but outspoken in his criticism of NYPD tactics, to a historic landslide win in the fall.\n\n\"Myself, as a police professional for over 40 years and as a resident of the city for the last five years,\" Bratton told council members Monday, \"I shared the opinion of the mayor that the quantity of the enforcement activity - particularly as it related to 'stop, question, and frisk' - was inappropriate, even from observing it from the outside.\"\n\nBratton said that he began to assess NYPD training even before the fatal arrest of Garner. Prior to his appearance Monday, a small crowd gathered in front of City Hall to protest the Staten Island resident's death in police custody. Last month, the Rev. Al Sharpton led a march of thousands of protesters at the site of Garner's death , demanding that criminal charges be brought against the officers involved in the arrest.\n\nMany community groups continued to condemn Bratton's signature policing methods after his testimony Monday. Critics say his \"broken windows\" approach unfairly targets poor minority areas - for example, Garner's fatal arrest for selling loose cigarettes.\n\n\"No matter how much officer training is enhanced, Broken Windows policing increases the odds of misconduct and wrongful arrests,\" said Emily Galvin, a criminal defense attorney with the Bronx Defenders, in a statement. \" 'Broken Windows' policing creates distrust in communities through the sheer volume of police encounters and the disparate targeting of communities of color.\"\n\nBut the new three-day in-service training, which will be held at the department's new police academy facilities in Queens, will include \"two core priorities,\" the commissioner said.\n\n\"First, how to talk to an initially uncooperative person with the goal of avoiding a physical confrontation and second, how to physically restrain a suspect who continues to resist arrest without harm to that individual or the officer,\" Bratton said.\n\nBut despite saying that he felt NYPD training needed \"significant enhancement,\" the commissioner also said the department has been a \"model of restraint\" among all the nation's police forces.\n\nNew York cops have resorted to force for less than 2 percent of all arrests so far this year - the lowest rate since the department started keeping records. Officers used force during nearly 9 percent of arrests in 1992 and 4.6 percent in 2004. \"We're making 98 out of 100 arrests without reportable use of force,\" Bratton said.\n\n\"Included in these arrests are more than 25,000 arrests including weapons, 5,000 of which involved firearms,\" he continued. \"These numbers demonstrate the judgment and skill of the vast majority of our officers in dealing with frequently difficult arrest situations.\"\n\nBut annual tactical training seminars will help officers reduce tense encounters even more, Bratton said.\n\n\"Our goal is ambitious because it has to be,\" he said. \"Within a few years, our expectation is that other police departments will be coming to us for guidance in best practices and we'll be the nation's model for both recruit and in-service training.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

O'Neill, officers who are granted a religious accommodation from the department's Equal Employment Opportunity Office will be able to grow beards that extend up to half an inch from the face, and may also wear a blue turban with a hat shield in lieu of a traditional police hat. Previously, officers with a medical or religious accommodation were permitted to grow a beard no longer than one millimeter in length, a policy that came under review after a Muslim officer filed a federal class-action lawsuit in June.\n\n\"We're making this change to make sure that we allow everybody in New York City that wants to apply and have the opportunity to work in the greatest police department in the nation, to make sure we give them that opportunity,\" Commissioner O'Neill said on Wednesday in explanation of the revised rules, as reported by The New York Times.\n\nThe decision to allow beards and turbans comes at a time when many US Muslims and Sikhs report feeling unsafe, following a 67 percent increase in hate crimes against Muslims in 2015 and a reported surge in anti-Muslim crimes and rhetoric linked to the 2016 presidential election. There has similarly been an increase in hate crimes and discrimination against Sikhs in the years since Sept. 11, 2001, members of the religious community say, as many Americans have difficulty distinguishing between different types of religious headgear.\n\n\"This is happening because the Sikh culture is poorly understood by most people...especially because our fear is making us blind to differences amongst people who look different than we do,\" psychiatrist Carole Lieberman told The Christian Science Monitor last year. \"All strangers feel threatening to us because, as terrorism crosses from foreign countries to America, we are becoming more overwhelmed with fear. People are so angry that the American way of life is being disturbed, that to some, it feels good to commit a hate crime - even if they have mistaken the target of their hate.\"\n\nWhile some Muslim women have begun to leave their hijabs at home out of fear of attracting negative public attention, other members of the Sikh and Muslim communities say it's increasingly important for vulnerable religious groups to stand up for their religious identities, as Gloria Goodale reported for the Monitor :\n\nThere are signs that the [Sikh] community is beginning to assert its distinct identity and rights. Hapreet Singh Saini, who lost his mother in the mass shooting in Oak Creek , Wis., in 2012 when he was 18, was the first Sikh American to testify in front of Congress after the tragedy. He implored Congress to recognize her religious identity, because \"she deserves her rights,\" he says.\n\nIn addition, while some Sikhs have decided to publicly play down their religious affiliation, earlier this month the US Army issued the first accommodation for a Sikh soldier in a combat position. It will allow Capt. Simratpal Singh to temporarily grow out his beard and wear a turban - actions that have historically been at odds with the military's strict grooming standards.\n\nLast year, a Sikh accountant won a settlement from the federal government that would allow her to bring her kirpan, a small, sheathed ceremonial dagger to be worn at all times as an article of faith, to work at federal buildings. As a result of her case, the Department of Homeland Security's Federal Protective Service set up a procedure by which Sikhs could apply for religious accommodations to carry their kirpans into federal buildings. DHS admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement.\n\nIn permitting Sikh and Muslim officers to don turbans and grow out their beards, the NYPD joins a small number of police departments with similar policies, including agencies in Washington, D.C., and Riverside, Calif.\n\nThere have also been efforts to increase inclusiveness in the US Army. In April, four Sikh soldiers were granted long-term religious accommodations to wear beards and turbans, more than doubling the number of Sikhs who had been previously granted such accommodations.\n\nWhile supporters applauded the move, they also noted that the current process of applying for religious accommodations is quite laborious and may discourage young religious minorities from serving in the military.\n\n\"I think that's a shame, because that situation basically pushes away young, qualified candidates, be it from the Sikh religion, or from the Muslim religion, or Buddhist,\" Maj. Kamal Kalsi, the first Sikh to be granted a religious accommodation by the Army in nearly a generation, told the Monitor. \"If we want a modern progressive military that looks like America, we're going to have to come to terms with the fact that not all Americans look alike.\"\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

An increasing focus on the number of people dying in police custody, among other incidents, have led to protests and reforms to promote transparency in encounters between officers and civilians.\n\nIn line with those reforms, more police departments have been introducing body cameras. But how have officers responded to them?\n\nThe New York Police Department handed 54 participants body cams when it started its pilot program last December, and on Thursday, released a 71-page report reviewing its ups and downs so far.\n\nThe report calls for stricter guidelines before the program expands and offers 23 suggestions that can both improve police-community relations and protect the safety of officers and the public, covering issues such as camera activation, protecting the anonymity of certain groups, retention periods, and footage access.\n\nThe experts also stress that \"any expansion of the NYPD's program must include community input.\"\n\n\"You want people to have greater trust in the police,\" NYPD Inspector General Philip Eure told the New York Daily News. \"You want people to have greater trust in the use of body cameras.\"\n\nBut it may take officers a while to build that trust with their communities.\n\nA notable issue Mr. Eure found was that officers generally don't know when it's appropriate to use the cameras.\n\n\"To cut down on the confusion, we recommend in our report that the NYPD broaden its standards for mandatory recording, including all investigative encounters,\" Eure said.\n\nWhile other police departments allow cops to record every encounter or to use \"full discretion in determining when to record,\" NYPD officers are trained to turn their cameras on only when there's a reasonable suspicion of a crime happening, during traffic stops, and during incidents where force is used.\n\nBut those limits are \"too restrictive to fully capture the wide range of police-community encounters,\" the report said, and comprehensive footage would benefit police officials \"far more\" than it would the public, added Ed Mullins, president of the Sergeants Benevolent Association.\n\nCambridge University published the first scientific study of policing with body cameras last December. Based on its findings, researchers wrote that \"evidence capture is just one output of body-worn video, and the technology is perhaps most effective at actually preventing escalation during police-public interactions: whether that's abusive behavior towards police or unnecessary use-of-force by police.\"\n\nOnce a camera is on, both parties involved become more self-aware, note the researchers, and that self-awareness is considered the main factor that could prevent violent interactions.\n\nYet recent footage from officers' body cameras shed light on another advantage.\n\n\"As a growing number of police departments are equipping officers with digital body cameras, the so-called blue wall of silence, the unwritten rule that officers never speak ill of one another to outsiders, is being tested perhaps like never before,\" writes The Christian Science Monitor's Patrik Jonsson .\n\nOn July 19, a former University of Cincinnati officer stopped an unarmed motorist over a missing front license plate, and within minutes, shot the man to death, claiming he was about to run the officer over.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

But once officials unveiled footage of the incident , another version became apparent.\n\nSurely, this case doesn't represent all police interactions. But it shows that body cameras can present \"prosecutors the hard evidence they need to override deflections by police officers who go beyond the constitutional protections they enjoy,\" writes The Monitor's Jonsson, including \"US Supreme Court rulings that give officers wide leeway to make mistakes as they make split-second life-or-death decisions.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

If so much evidence and research does not get him to shift his position on this issue, it's not clear what would,\" she tells the Monitor.\n\nFor reform advocates like Dr. Ghandnoosh, who argue broken windows paved the way for controversial \"stop and frisk\" policies that have been found to have disproportionately impacted black and Latino New Yorkers, the selection of a new commissioner could be significant.\n\n\"Hopefully somebody who doesn't have this long history and whose legacy is not so strongly tied to this form of policing might be able to change things around a little bit more than Bratton has been willing to,\" she says.\n\nOn the other hand, says Zaino, the political scientist, Mr. O'Neill is a longtime Bratton ally who has moved up through the department's ranks. \"So I think that it's possible there won't be as many changes as there might have been because de Blasio hasn't reached for somebody new.\"\n\nBut in his second stint as commissioner, Bratton was particularly effective at smoothing tensions between the de Blasio administration and police unions, she notes.\n\nThose concerns came to a head in January 2015, when a series of officers turned their backs on the mayor during the funeral of two officers killed by a gunman who had said he was upset about police killings of black men.\n\n\"It was always Bratton who was there trying to walk that line between 'let's be understanding to the community' and, obviously, 'let's respect the men and women in blue.' And he was always trying to kind of be that peacemaker,\" Zaino says.\n\nHe began his first stint in New York under Mayor Giuliani with a rallying cry, saying, \"I did not come here to lose,\" as he accepted the job in 1993.\n\nBut this year, he was candid about the frustrations many people of color feel in encounters with police. \"No matter how rich they are,\" he told The New York Times, most African-Americans have had \"negative experiences\" with the police and \"they all respond the same to these incidents: There is a fear, there's an anger, there's a frustration.\"\n\nFor Bratton, who began his career in Boston in the 1970s as racial tensions over court-ordered busing roiled the city, and later moved to Los Angeles in the early 2000s, that shift has led to further reforms, notes Ghandnoosh, of the Sentencing Project.\n\nHe came to support efforts by the City Council to reform New York City's summons system and decrease penalties for low-level offenses, reports Politico. A broader approach to broken windows policing, she notes, could also point it more in the direction of community policing, she says.\n\n\"Some of the research that shows broken windows policing to be effective actually defines broken windows pretty broadly, as not just arresting and ticketing and summons-ing, but police actually doing things like repairing broken windows.\"\n\n\"So it's possible for the police to have a lot of contact with people and begin rebuilding these frayed relationships by engaging with communities and trying to understand what are the problems and what are ways of fixing them without bringing out the handcuffs,\" Ghandnoosh adds.\n\nFor de Blasio, whose administration is facing a series of corruption investigations , including some linked to the police department, Bratton's departure could also pose further challenges, notes Zaino.\n\n\"I think having Bratton there allowed him to say 'Hey look, I have somebody in position who has worked under Republican mayors, whose first commitment is to law and order and to public safety, who's not coming to this with a political mind necessarily,'\" she says. \"I think that Bratton leaving does really open up this question again.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

      "text": "NYPD ShotSpotter Gunshot Detection Is Wildly Inaccurate, New Study Finds\n\nBy Lars Daniel\n\nBy Lars Daniel ,\n\nContributor.\n\nShotSpotter gunshot detection technology is seen in use on a light pole.\n\nA new report from Brooklyn Defender Services scrutinizes the effectiveness of ShotSpotter, the gunshot-detection technology deployed by the New York Police Department, finding that it creates more problems than solutions for communities it is meant to protect.\n\nShotSpotter is a gunshot-detection system designed to identify and locate gunfire in real time. It uses a network of acoustic sensors placed in urban areas to detect the sound of gunfire. When the system detects a potential gunshot, it analyzes the sound and sends an alert to law enforcement, providing information such as the location of the incident, the number of shots fired and the time it occurred.\n\nThe report analyzed nearly 62,000 ShotSpotter alerts logged over nine years. The data reveals that only 16% of these alerts led to confirmed incidents of gunfire. This means that over 80% of deployments prompted by ShotSpotter yielded no evidence of gunfire at the reported locations.\n\nDuring high-noise holidays like New Year's Eve and July 4th, the system's inaccuracies become even more pronounced. Alerts surge by 175% and 200%, respectively, as fireworks and other celebratory noises are misclassified as gunshots. This pattern of false positives can lead to the misdirecting of police resources and potentially problematic interactions with the community, as false positives can lead to confrontations caused by confusion.\n\nThe data paints a stark picture of ShotSpotter's effectiveness. Of the tens of thousands of alerts analyzed, a mere 0.9% led to the recovery of a firearm, while only 0.7% resulted in an arrest. In other words, over 99% of all ShotSpotter deployments failed to yield any weapon recovery, raising serious questions about the system's practical value in addressing gun violence.\n\nThis dismal success rate becomes even more concerning when considering the significant police resources dedicated to investigating each alert. For nearly every hundred times officers rush to respond to a ShotSpotter notification, they leave empty-handed, having found no evidence of the reported gunfire.\n\nA recent incident in Chicago dramatically illustrates the dangers of ShotSpotter's inaccuracy. On Jan. 25, Chicago police officers responding to a ShotSpotter alert encountered a teenager, approximately 14 or 15 years old, in his own backyard. After hearing a loud bang, which was later confirmed to be fireworks, an officer opened fire on the unarmed child.\n\nWhile fortunately no physical injuries occurred, the incident's aftermath revealed troubling details. Police initially misreported the event, claiming they had fired at a \"man\" who shot at officers. The Chicago Civilian Office of Police Accountability later confirmed no firearm was used against the officers.\n\nThe report also highlights a troubling disparity in how ShotSpotter is deployed across neighborhoods. Predominantly Black neighborhoods experienced 3.5 times more alerts compared to predominantly white neighborhoods. This disparity raises concerns about over-policing in communities already grappling with strained relations with law enforcement. Police responding to false ShotSpotter alerts may initiate stops, searches or investigations based on limited or no evidence, exacerbating tensions and contributing to perceptions of bias.\n\nThe NYPD's investment in ShotSpotter is substantial, totaling $45 million to date. In addition to the financial commitment, the system consumes significant personnel resources. Officers spend an average of nine hours investigating each alert, even when no gunfire is ultimately confirmed.\n\nThe Brooklyn Defender Services report is not the first to question the efficacy of ShotSpotter, but it adds to a growing body of evidence questioning the efficacy of the technology. Critics argue that the system's inaccuracies and deployment patterns contribute to over-policing, misdirect resources and undermine public safety initiatives.\n\nProponents of ShotSpotter maintain that the system plays a critical role in addressing gun violence, asserting that its benefits outweigh its shortcomings. However, this report should cause us to pause. Any evaluation of the technology must consider not just its potential utility but also it's accuracy-and the tangible impact a lack of accuracy could have on the communities it serves.\n\nThe controversy surrounding ShotSpotter extends beyond New York City, as major metropolitan areas across the United States grapple with the technology's effectiveness. While over 150 cities currently use the system, several major municipalities, including Chicago, Atlanta, and Portland, have opted to discontinue its use.\n\nThe NYPD has been contacted for comment. This article will be updated when they respond."

We have to stop it. We have to get back to law and order. We have to do a lot of things differently because this is not working. This is happening too often,\" Trump said outside of Diller's wake on Thursday. Diller was the first NYPD officer killed in the line of duty in a little over two years , since Wilbert Mora and Jason Rivera were killed by a gunman in Harlem while responding to a domestic violence call in January 2022. A study from the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund found that deaths in the line of duty across the country fell dramatically last year, decreasing by 39% in 2023. The study found that 136 officers were killed in the line of duty across the country, down from a total of 224 in 2022. Of those 136 deaths, only 47 were killed by gunshots-also down from 63 gun violence-related deaths in 2022. Violent crime rates have also fallen in New York City over the last year, according to the NYPD's data . Although some crimes like felony assault and grand larceny rose over the course of 2023, many violent crimes, including shootings and murder, fell significantly.\n\nTrump was one of four presidents and former presidents in the New York metro area on Thursday, as former presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama arrived for a major fundraiser for President Joe Biden's reelection campaign at Radio City Music Hall in Manhattan. The president's campaign said it already raised $25 million , a record for a single fundraiser."

Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., said she was suspended by Columbia's Barnard College for her involvement in the protests, but she also stated she would \"not be intimidated\" and the protesters would \"stand resolute until our demands are met\"-it is currently unclear if Hirsi was among the students who were arrested.\n\n\"Protests have a storied history at Columbia and are an essential component of free speech in America and on our campus,\" Shafik wrote in an email obtained by Forbes that was sent to students and faculty on Thursday. Columbia was previously the site of major protests against segregation and the Vietnam War during the student movement in the 1960s. \"We work hard to balance the rights of students to express political views with the need to protect other students from rhetoric that amounts to harassment and discrimination.\"\n\nMany university campuses have faced tense protests since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, but some protesters have faced allegations of antisemitic rhetoric. The presidents of Harvard University, MIT and the University of Pennsylvania testified about their campuses' climate before the House in December, months before Shafik's testimony, often leading to sparring between the academic leaders and lawmakers. The presidents of MIT and Penn resigned shortly after the testimony, and Harvard President Claudine Gay resigned after allegations of plagiarism were levied against her one month later\n\nThe encampment was erected around 4 a.m. on Wednesday morning on the south lawn of the Ivy League college's Morningside Heights campus, the student newspaper Columbia Spectator reported. The university ordered the encampment to disperse Wednesday night, and offered amnesty to any student protesters who left before 9 p.m. The same day, Shafik testified before the House Education and Workforce Committee about antisemitism on campus. At the hearing, Shafik said antisemitism \"has no place on our campus\" and told legislators addressing the concerns was their \"highest priority right now at Columbia.\""

More Apple (Photo by Noam Galai/Getty Images)\n\nComparisons to Nazis or other elements of the Third Reich began long before the days of social media, but increasingly it is used to denigrate the authorities when they enforce rules some don't find agreeable. Such has been the case for decades, but it certainly increased during the Trump administration and some of its policies, but it was also directed at many Democratic governors and mayors who have mandated lockdowns related to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nOn Tuesday, a comparison of the New York Police Department (NYPD) was made by conservative commentator Todd Starnes to the infamous Gestapo, the secret police created by Hermann Göring in 1933. He reported that patrons at a restaurant in Brooklyn were forced to leave after they refused to show their vaccine papers.\n\nVia Twitter, Starnes (@toddstarnes) shared a link to his commentary including the headline \"It's a Sad Day in America When the Police Behave Like the Gestapo.\"\n\nPodcaster Benny Johnson (@bennyjohnson) also shared footage of the alleged incident, with the caption \"Evil. Gestapo. KGB. NYPD Attacking a 5 year old eating pizza? Take off your badges, oath breakers. New York City is a failed state.\"\n\nBy early afternoon there had been more than 100,000 tweets related to the term \"Gestapo,\" with many firing back that police actions were actually the catalyst that began the Black Lives Matters movement, while others suggested that it was a false equivalency.\n\nActivist Johnny Akzam (@JohnnyAkzam) as among those who attempted to address the issue writing, \"I don't think people even realize their own inconsistencies. Introspection, please. Now thin-blue-line conservatives are pissed at cops for enforcing vaccine mandates. They weren't calling them Gestapo when they were gassing, bashing, and terrorizing lawful protesters.\"\n\nAnthro-journalist Will Black (@WillBlackWriter) responded to the issue as well, but also by making a Nazi comparison, tweeting, \"People who supported a racist president who gained power with the help of far-right Bannon, far-right Breitbart and Nazis like Richard Spencer - and then attempted a violent fascist coup when voted out by a landslide - aren't coming off great by using the word Gestapo\"\n\nThe question in this case is whether such comparisons to the most vile, insidious and evil regime in history should be used in such a manner. It has become all too easy, especially on social media, to use the terms \"Nazi\" or \"Gestapo\" as a \"go-to\" pejorative when the other side's policies are disliked.\n\nWhat makes this worse is that it used by few that know much more about the actual Gestapo beyond movie and TV show caricatures. The actual Gestapo, which was administered by the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA), played a key role in the Holocaust. After the end of the Second World War, it was declared a criminal organization by the International Military Tribunal (IMT) at the Nuremberg trials that began in November 1945.\n\nDuring its history, there had been strict protocols at protecting the identity of Gestapo field personnel, and an operative was only required to present his warrant disc without personal information or picture identification - so the comparison to a uniformed police force is also largely misplaced.\n\n\"When we use language repeatedly for dramatic appeal, we weaken it,\" warns Amy Bennett, who holds a master's degree in journalism and is a former managing editor for two community newspapers.\n\n\"And when we weaken language around issues that involve injustice and atrocious acts against groups of people, we do humanity, history and - most importantly - those initially harmed a disservice,\" added Bennett, who has also taught in the field of journalism and public relations for 15 years at a private institution. \"Unfortunately, the Internet has fueled these instances by allowing those with similar immature language standards to feed off of each other and group together, amplifying their unrefined use of language around their outrage.\""

More in a murder investigation.\"\n\nRaad Almansoori, a 26-year-old suspected of murdering a woman in a Manhattan hotel room on February 8, was arrested by police in Surprise, Arizona, on Sunday after stabbing one woman in a McDonalds and another while trying to steal her car on the road.\n\nAfter being taken into custody, Almansoori confessed to the stabbings in Arizona and the murder in New York, Surprise Police Chief Benny Piña confirmed at a press conference on Wednesday morning.\n\nHowever, Maricopa County Attorney Rachel Mitchell, a Republican prosecutor elected in 2022, announced at the same press conference that her office would refuse to comply with an extradition request from New York, citing Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's \"treatment of violent criminals.\"\n\nBragg's office has been frequently criticized by conservatives as being too lenient on crime, with congressional Republicans even conducting a field hearing on \"rampant crime\" in his district in 2023, despite an overall decrease in murders, shootings, robberies, grand larceny and burglaries, according to the NYPD .\n\nMitchell said that her decision was not related to the murder investigation conducted by the New York Police Department, telling reporters \"I know they did a hard job and a good job.\"\n\nEmily Tuttle, a spokesperson for Bragg's office, called Mitchell's actions a \"slap in the face\" to the NYPD and the victim's family, and accused the Arizona prosecutor of \"playing political games in a murder investigation.\"\n\nBragg was elected in 2021 after running on a progressive platform of criminal justice reform. Shortly after taking office, Bragg announced he would take steps to \"reduce pretrial incarceration,\" only holding suspects on bail for \"the most serious matters.\" Bragg's policies have frequently drawn criticism from conservatives, who accuse the progressive prosecutor of being soft on crime. His bail policies face increasing scrutiny after his office released six suspects who were suspected of beating an NYPD officer outside a migrant shelter near Times Square in January. One suspect was arrested immediately after the attack, but critics were outraged after the others seemingly walked free. Five more suspects were all indicted by a grand jury in February on charges of assault, obstruction of government and hindering prosecution. At the press conference on Wednesday, Mitchell emphasized that Almansoori was being held in Arizona without bail, \"meaning there is no amount of money that he can post to get out of custody at this point,\" the prosecutor said. \"I think it's safer to keep him here and keep him in custody so that he cannot be out doing this to individuals either in our state, county or anywhere in the United States.\"\n\nThe Manhattan District Attorney's Office quickly pointed out that murder in New York City has decreased significantly since Bragg took office. Although violent crime, such as rape and assault rose between 2021 and 2022 , murders began decreasing. In 2022, New York City's murder rate was 5.42 per 100,000 people, according to statistics cited by FactCheck.org . Phoenix's murder rate was more than double, at 11.6 per 100,000 people. Murder continued to decrease significantly in 2023, with the NYPD reporting murders down by 11.9% over the course of the year."

Each of the 34 counts is punishable by up to four years in prison and/or a maximum fine of $5,000. In total, he faces up to 136 years in prison and $170,000 in fines, though experts believe it is unlikely Trump serves time as a first-time offender. Trump, who has full-time protection from the U.S. Secret Service, even if he were imprisoned , is likely to appeal his conviction.

More former President Donald Trump said at a rally Wednesday discussing the NYPD clearing the Columbia University encampment.\n\nAt his Wisconsin rally, Trump said Hamilton Hall-the building occupied by pro-Palestinan protesters at Columbia-\"took a beating,\" but praised the police who cleared out the protesters, saying \"in exactly two hours everything was over, it was a beautiful thing to watch, New York's finest.\"\n\nThe comments followed similar remarks Trump made on Fox News on Tuesday night, when he called in and told Sean Hannity that \"New York City's finest have been incredible ... they were not afraid of anything.\"\n\nOn Fox News on Tuesday, Trump also claimed-without evidence-that there were \"paid agitators (and) professional agitators\" who were \"paid by a source\" to be protesting.\n\nAt his rally, Trump used the praise of New York's police to call for police to be supported and funded nationwide, saying \"they're great and they can do the job, but we have to give them the power back.\"\n\nTrump also criticized Columbia president Minouche Shafik, saying she was so \"weak,\" \"afraid,\" \"bad\" and waited too long to call on the NYPD to clear the demonstrators, who had been at an encampment since mid-April.\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We're launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day's headlines. Text \"Alerts\" to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here .\n\nTuesday night marked the second time Columbia University and Shafik called the NYPD in to clear the encampment that had been in place since April 17, when students began the encampment to protest the school's investment in Israel and calling for it to completely divest. Shafik's decision to call in the police a second time followed students expanding the encampment and taking over Hamilton Hall , a historic building on Columbia's campus that had been occupied during past student protests, as well. The NYPD arrested more than 100 people on Columbia's main campus Tuesday night, officials said Wednesday, though it was not yet clear how many were students. Shafik, who previously hinted she didn't plan to call on officers again for help, defended her decision Wednesday morning, saying in a statement that the \"drastic escalation\" of protesters occupying Hamilton Hall \"pushed the University to the brink\" and created an \"intolerable level\" of safety risks for the community.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has been less severe in his criticism of the protests at Columbia and other universities nationwide, but said last week \"I condemn the antisemitic protests ... I also condemn those who don't understand what's going on with the Palestinians.\" On Wednesday, when asked if Biden supported the NYPD being sent to Columbia, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said students had gone past their right to peaceful protest, saying, \"forcibly taking over buildings is not peaceful, it's just not,\" The New York Times reported .\n\nOne Community.

The health insurance industry's close relationship with tragedy and suffering makes it a prime target for anger, and the industry has faced elevated threats from social media and email for years, Dumpert told Forbes. Thompson's wife reportedly said he had been sent threats before his death. \"Both prior to and after the suspected perpetrator's identification and arrest, some online users across social media platforms reacted positively to the killing, encouraged future targeting of similar executives, and shared conspiracy theories regarding the shooting,\" NYPD's bulletin said , according to ABC News.\n\nThroughout the days following the murder and the corresponding manhunt, Thompson's death has become a polarizing topic, with some online defending the violent crime or explaining discontent toward the health insurance industry more broadly. Senator Elizabeth Warren, D-MA, told the Huffington Post that she condemns violence but understands the reaction and called it \"a warning to everyone in the healthcare system.\" Police have not specified an alleged motive for Mangione-whose lawyer says he will likely plead not guilty-but authorities say they found a manifesto criticizing the insurance industry along with a notebook justifying the shooting.\n\nOne Community.

More after they barricaded themselves at the Hamilton Hall building near Gaza Solidarity Encampment earlier in New York, United States on April 30, 2024. (Photo by Selcuk Acar/Anadolu via Getty Images)\n\nShafik said in Wednesday's statement that the \"drastic escalation\" of protesters occupying Hamilton Hall Tuesday \"pushed the University to the brink\" and created an \"intolerable level\" of safety risks for the community.\n\n\"I am sorry we reached this point,\" Shafik said in the statement, which came hours after the university president called on the NYPD to clear students from Hamilton Hall, and clear the student encampment in place to protest the university's investments in Israel.\n\nShafik said the students' actions in overtaking Hamilton Hall were \"acts of destruction, not political speech,\" and that many students felt \"uncomfortable and unwelcome\" as a result of the protests and demonstrations.\n\nShafik defended her actions in the statement, saying the school had been \"patient in tolerating unauthorized demonstrations\" for months and had engaged in negotiations with students urging divestment, despite not being able to come to a resolution.\n\nForbes has reached out to Columbia University Apartheid Divest, the group organizing the encampment that was taken down, for comment.\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We're launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day's headlines. Text \"Alerts\" to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here .\n\nShortly after Shafik's statement was released Wednesday, CNN reported Columbia moved final exams, which begin this Friday, on its main campus-which is currently restricted to students living in dorms-to a remote format. The university is also suggesting finals for undergraduate students be made optional, have adjusted grading policies or be canceled.\n\n\"I hope that we can use the weeks ahead to restore calm,\" Shafik said in the statement. \"We also must continue with urgency our ongoing dialogue on the important issues ... especially the balance between free speech and discrimination and the role of a university in contributing to better outcomes in the Middle East.\"\n\n109. That's about how many people were arrested on Columbia's campus Tuesday night in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, NYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell said Wednesday. It wasn't yet clear how many were students.\n\nStudents at Columbia University have been protesting the school's investment in Israel and calling for it to completely divest for about two weeks after setting up a tent encampment on April 17. One day after the encampment began, Shafik allowed the NYPD to sweep it, resulting in more than 100 arrests for trespassing. In a statement last Friday, university leaders said \"that to bring back the NYPD at this time would be counterproductive\" and could further inflame what was happening on campus, though students overtaking Hamilton Hall was seemingly enough to change the university's response. Prior to calling the police Tuesday night, the university distributed leaflets telling students they had to leave the encampment by 2 p.m. EDT or they could face \"probation, access restriction, suspension for a term or more and expulsion.\" Student protesters voted to stay in the encampment, and Columbia said it began suspending students around 5:30 p.m. EDT in order \"to ensure safety on our campus.\" In a statement, the university said it called on the NYPD \"in response to the actions of the protesters, not the cause they are championing.\"\n\nOne Community.

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nNew York Police Department (NYPD) Commissioner Jessica Tisch called out the legal system for declining prosecution rates of offenders and pushed for more cops to join the force and patrol during her first \"State of the NYPD\" address on Thursday.\n\nNewsweek has reached out to the NYPD public officer for comment via email on Thursday.\n\nThe address is an annual speech providing an overview of the current state of crime, the department's performance, and the force's future.\n\nTisch, NYPD commissioner, came out tough on repeat crime despite announcing lower crime rates and advocated for more cops in the force and on the streets. Following the murder of George Floyd , there have been repeated calls to \"defund the police,\" primarily from Democrats in large cities.\n\nTisch, 43, was appointed as NYPD commissioner by New York City Mayor Eric Adams in late November. She previously served as the city's sanitation chief.\n\nTisch, who has never served as a police officer, worked in a civil role within the department for over a decade. She will be the second-ever woman to serve as the NYPD commissioner.\n\nHer father, James Tisch, has been the chief executive officer of Loews Co since 1999. The billionaire also sits on the board of directors of the New York Public Library and The Jewish Agency, among others.\n\nIn her address, Tisch largely credited the city's lower crime rates to a shift from precinct-level policing to smaller \"zones.\" She described it as a \"hyper-local, data-driven\" approach and a \"focused, location-based scalpel\" for crime.\n\nHowever, despite the decline in crime-which she reported as declines in every borough with reductions in murder, robbery, grand larceny, and auto theft, as well as shooting incidents down more than 28 percent-she came out strong against repeat offenders, saying: \"We know we could be doing so much more, and we know what's standing in our way: it's surging recidivism.\"\n\nShe called out 2020 criminal justice law reforms that she said created a \"revolving door that put repeat offenders back on our streets again and again and again. The system is unsustainable, it defies common sense-and it is crying out for a course correction.\"\n\nCiting stats, she noted that in 2024, in comparison with 2018, there was an \"unacceptable surge in the number of individuals arrested three or more times for the same crime in the same year. The increase was 61 percent for burglary, 64 percent for shoplifting, 71 percent for grand larceny, 83 percent for robbery, and 119 percent for auto theft. And when we look at felony assault-an index crime that was up in 2024-the increase was a staggering 147 percent.\"\n\nShe also noted that for misdemeanor crimes, \"the rates of decline to prosecute were up 31 percent, while the rates of bail set were down 54 percent,\" in 2024 compared to 2018.\n\nTisch said she is pushing for changes to \"discovery law that will remove onerous restrictions and irrelevant technicalities that cause far too many cases to be needlessly dismissed-and allow dangerous offenders to avoid accountability under the law.\" In addition she has spoken with district attorneys, informing them that \"their declined prosecution rates, in particular for misdemeanor offenses, are unacceptable.\"\n\nThroughout her speech, Tisch pushed for hundreds of officers to leave their desks and patrol the streets and subways.\n\nShe also noted that she wants an increase in police force hiring to get numbers back up to 35,000 officers.\n\nShe said that rhetoric around \"defund the police\" movement \"is vile, and the pendulum has swung too far away from what I consider to be the most important and noble job anyone could do. And we need to swing it back,\" adding that \"more cops on patrol make our city safer.\"\n\nMany critics of the police establishment argue that adding more officers does not increase safety but instead creates unsafe environments where police violence can occur. Most incidents of police brutality and violence disproportionately affect racial minorities.\n\nAsh J, who has over 19,500 followers on X, formerly Twitter, wrote in a social media post on January 12: \"Jessica Tisch is a billionaire heiress & nepo baby. She herself is an embodiment of corruption & plutocracy. Plus, depending on NYPD cops to investigate & crackdown on corruption among their fellow cops is just absurd on its face.\"\n\nNew York Mayor Eric Adams wrote on X Thursday: \"There is no harder working police force in our country than our @NYPDnews! Proud to join @NYPDPC Tisch and our brothers and sisters in New York's Finest for today's \"State of the NYPD,\" where the commissioner laid out our vision to make the five boroughs even safer.\"\n\nTisch is entering her third month on the job.

Mayor [Eric] Adams has given us all the resources we need and greenlit every class we wanted to bring in, but the applicants are just not there.\"\n\nTo grow the force by incentivizing recruits and reducing the number of disqualified applicants, Tisch announced that the department will lower its college credit requirement.\n\n\"Currently, the NYPD requires at least 60 college credits to enter the Academy,\" she said, adding that \"in 2023, this requirement led to the disqualification of 29 percent of NYPD applicants-meaning we turned away 2,275 potential officers.

It remains unclear whether she will face any disciplinary action.\n\nThe music video has no connection to Mercado's role as a detective, as she does not wear NYPD paraphernalia or anything linking her to the department. While officers are required to file an off-duty employment form if they perform for money, her actions could be considered personal, which would not fall under department oversight.\n\nThis is not the first time an NYPD officer's off-duty behavior has attracted public attention. In 2021, a police officer responding to a noise complaint at a party was captured on TikTok staying to dance and eat tacos.\n\nIn 2022, officer Vera Mekuli made headlines after being filmed grinding on top of her supervisor at a bar in the Bronx.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nTahar Rajab is a Newsweek News and Features Journalist based in London, UK.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nNew York City Police Commissioner Edward Caban, 57, resigned on Thursday amid a federal investigation in which multiple city officials, including Caban's, phones were seized.\n\nThe head of the New York City Police Department ( NYPD ) wrote in his resignation letter obtained by multiple news outlets, \"The news around recent developments has created a distraction for our department, and I am unwilling to let my attention be on anything other than our important work, or the safety of the men and women of the NYPD.\"\n\n\"For the good of this city and this department-I have made the difficult decision to resign as Police Commissioner,\" Caban wrote.\n\nCaban has served in the NYPD for over 30 years, starting as a patrol officer in 1991 in the Bronx, where he grew up. He worked his way up the ranks and served as the department's first deputy commissioner before becoming commissioner last year, making him the first Latino to lead the department. Caban served as commissioner for about 15 months before resigning.\n\nNewsweek reached out to the NYPD via email for comment on Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe now-former commissioner comes from a family of cops. His father, retired Detective Juan Caban, served with New York City Mayor Eric Adams-who is an ex-police captain-on the city's transit police force, and three of Caban's brothers were also police officers.\n\nLast week, Caban's electronic devices were seized by FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) agents, people familiar with the matter told The Associated Press (AP).\n\nAt least four top deputies to New York Mayor Eric Adams also had their devices seized: First Deputy Mayor Sheena Wright; Philip Banks, the deputy mayor for public safety; his brother David Banks, the city's schools chancellor; and Timothy Pearson, a mayoral adviser and former high-ranking New York Police Department official.\n\nThe investigation is being led by the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan. The subject of the probe and whether the information that federal authorities were seeking is linked to one or more investigations is unclear at the moment.\n\nCaban's twin brother, James Caban, who runs a nightclub security business, is also being investigated by federal authorities, a person familiar with the matter told the AP.\n\nMeanwhile, Adams, a first-term Democrat, had his electronic devices seized in November 2023 as part of an investigation into political fundraising during his 2021 campaign. He, his campaign and City Hall were then subpoenaed over the summer. The investigation is not believed to be connected to the probe that led to Caban's devices being seized, two people familiar with the matter told the AP.\n\nAdams or any other city officials have not been publicly accused of any crimes. The mayor, meanwhile, has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nMeanwhile, Caban's handling of officer discipline has been criticized.\n\nCaban decided to not take internal department disciplinary action in April against two officers involved in the 2019 shooting death of a Black Bronx man, Kawaski Trawick, saying that the officers \"acted within the law\" and the city's police watchdog agency wait too long to bring administrative charges.\n\nThis past August, Caban upheld a judge's recommendation to drop a disciplinary case against Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey, who was accused of ordering officers to void a 2021 arrest of a retired cop who previously worked for him. The department administrative trial judge, Rosemarie Maldonado, said the watchdog agency didn't have jurisdiction to investigate.\n\nThis article includes reporting from The Associated Press.\n\nUpdate 9/12/24 1:11 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with additional information.\n\nRachel Dobkin is a Newsweek reporter based in New York.

Lightly edited.\n\nNewsweek AI is in beta. Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nMy wife and I came to the church over a decade ago. For a long while we had followed the Christian and Catholic teachings, but in 2009 we really started to see our bigger purpose-helping people on a spiritual level.\n\nI was working as a police officer and we began a ministry providing food and religious support to the homeless in Harlem, which really took off over the course of the next ten years.\n\nEventually, I became a missionary in Africa, where I came across a man who I believed was demonically possessed.\n\nThis person was acting in a very strange manner, slithering around on the floor and making unusual noises. We locked eyes, and I saw what I perceived to be pure evil. It was an evil that over all my years in law enforcement, I had never seen before.\n\nThe volunteers I was with believed he was having a seizure, but I have seen and treated hundreds of seizures, and this was nothing like them. In that moment, I saw the spiritual aspect of my faith in a whole new light.\n\nI saw it as the battle between God and the devil, good and evil.\n\nThat feeling stayed with me until I traveled back to the United States, where I began educating myself in the field of demonology.\n\nI joined the New York City Fire Department as an EMT in the mid-nineties. After a few years, I wanted to gain a little more knowledge and step up in the department, so I became a paramedic.\n\nDuring this period of my life, I had some amazing experiences; it's a very busy area where I saw all manner of illness, disease, and mental health issues. For a short while, I worked at JFK Airport, which saw people coming in from all over the world with all sorts of medical emergencies.\n\nIn 2003 I joined the NYPD , where I worked predominantly on the midnight patrol and had a stint in a plain clothes unit for a few years before returning to my initial position. It was a very interesting and exciting time for me because it offered the opportunity to go deeper into how the department goes about stopping criminal behavior.\n\nDuring my time in the plain clothes unit, we were seeking out criminals in their own element; quality-of-life offenses like gambling in public or drug deals. But many times, as I learned through experience and from officers before me, when you're in this kind of environment, there's a very good chance that a weapon is involved as well.\n\nSo it taught me to be very aware of my surroundings and to learn how a criminal may think.\n\nNow, in the field of demonology, when I receive calls from people during a spiritual emergency, the first thing I do is put those paramedic and police skills to work. I take down all of the initial medical information and really do my homework in terms of questioning them and analyzing the caller as I'm speaking to them.\n\nI try to get as much background information as I can on the person, because many times the caller themselves may be suffering from some kind of mental illness that I have to diagnose or investigate a little further.\n\nMy police work really comes into play when my wife and I visit locations all over the country. Unlike typical ghost-hunter television programs you may have seen, when we visit a house, I investigate not just the claims, but the people.\n\nI'm very alert and on guard; I'm using all those skills I obtained over the years to formulate if there is a danger. I feel as though God prepared me for where I am now.\n\nIn the early days of working in demonic haunting and oppression, things were relatively slow, but now that I'm a recognized name in the field I receive up to 100 calls a month. Our aim is to fill the gap of the church because there are many people who are having spiritual problems who can't find any help.\n\nAs I did when I was a paramedic, I triage incidents by categorizing calls into green, yellow, and red, with the former being the least urgent and the latter being an emergency situation. I don't take calls in order, and always prioritize vulnerable people.\n\nFor example, I recently had a call from the family of a young boy who I believe was being targeted by a demonic entity. After doing an investigation and deeming that this was real, we ran straight over and tried to help rid him of what we considered a demonic possession.\n\nI have experienced plenty of memorable cases, notably an incident in Connecticut with a young grandmother and her 4-year-old granddaughter, who had special needs. They had moved into their dream house in a beautiful part of the area, but hadn't known that the previous owner of their property was a Satanic witch.\n\nWe interviewed neighbors and did background checks; we found this grandmother never checked the attic when she purchased this house because it was very difficult to get to, there was no ladder, it was just a cut-out high in the ceiling.\n\nOne night she heard walking and banging in the attic and called her sisters, who came over the next day and discovered demonic sigils and markings all over the walls, bloody hand prints, animal skulls nailed around in a circle, and other witchcraft tools.\n\nShortly afterward, they discovered the 4-year-old child had been having some kind of invisible relationship with this creature and knew things we felt were impossible for a child of that age to know.\n\nShe had her own specific name for this entity, which we later discovered was the name of a real demonic entity that's written down in history, and was drawing the outline of what it looked like. This entity makes a certain noise, which the child was mimicking.\n\nWe knew we were dealing with something serious, so after we did the investigation around the house, which was a few hours, we proceeded into the attic to perform the Catholic ritual. We recorded some horrific activity.\n\nThere was a smell coming up from the ground as I was reading and the family recorded downstairs a growling, roaring sound around the entire house. At the same time as the ritual, fighting against this demon who she called her friend, the little girl was apparently giving a play-by-play of what was happening.\n\nThat was a very memorable case. It was a textbook case that is right out of the movies, but it doesn't always happen like that. There are many occasions when we don't feel or see anything, but then go back and see lots of spiritual activity on footage.\n\nIt's tough to know exactly how many cases are due to mental health issues, and how many are down to what we believe to be spiritual problems. I came to demonology very aware that mental illness paired with poor religious leadership could facilitate a platform for some people to live out a religious delusion or a fantasy.\n\nWhat I have found myself doing today is educating people on the correct ideology of the Bible, how to live rationally, and also leading them to a mental health counselor or a psychiatrist, and I've done that many times.\n\nThe other tough aspect of this kind of job is making sure you don't lose contact with the person, because all it takes is saying the wrong thing once, and you may never hear from that person again.\n\nToday I'm doing a lot of educating, going deeper into psychology, and trying to be sure if it is a mental illness or a spiritual issue, because I feel that at times they could be working together. To be involved in this field, you have to be educated as well as spiritual, because you're dealing with people's lives.\n\nThe last thing I do is to deem a problem spiritual; I want to go down every avenue before I make that claim.\n\nThe reason I am speaking out about my career is because with many people who are afflicted by these sorts of issues, the signs of danger are there and nobody believes them.\n\nI believe that generally, if people were educated and made aware of these warning signs, and knew to alert the authorities immediately, we could largely stop crimes caused by this type of delusion taking place.\n\nWhen I get cases and people call me and tell me they believe a family member is possessed, I take it very seriously, but I try to bring a very rational and sensible aspect to the spiritual world, rather than exacerbating someone's situation.\n\nI believe we need to be responsible in the spiritual field, and that pastors need to really be aware of the congregation and the beliefs they hold.\n\nWe need to make sure we're actually helping that person, and that mental health professionals and clergy can work together to help the mental and spiritual state of people.\n\nChris DeFlorio is a former paramedic and NYPD officer who works in the field of religious demonology.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nThe New York City Police Department saw its budget slashed this week, leading to the Department of Homeland Security looking (DHS) to recruit dejected police officers who may be getting the idea that NYC \"doesn't want\" them anymore.\n\nOn Tuesday, city lawmakers approved a $88.9 billion 2021 budget that saw funding for the NYPD slashed by $1 billion.\n\nThe budget cut came in response to widespread calls to \"defund the police\" following the killing of George Floyd, a Black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck for nearly nine minutes during an arrest on May 25.\n\nWhile many lawmakers were in favor of slashing NYPD funding, some expressed disappointment, saying the $1 billion cut didn't go far enough.\n\nIn the wake of the decision, however, DHS Acting Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli appealed to NYPD officers to consider abandoning the department altogether and join federal law enforcement instead.\n\nIn a tweet published on Wednesday, Cuccinelli told NYPD officers the DHS \"would love to have you if NYC doesn't want you!\"\n\n\"Come join our team, where you will be appreciated by your political leadership instead of being belittled and treated like you are the problem instead of part of the solution,\" he said.\n\n(1/5) Hey, #NYPD , @DHSgov would love to have you if NYC doesn't want you! Come join our team, where you will be appreciated by your political leadership instead of being belittled and treated like you are the problem instead of part of the solution.\n\nThe DHS, Cuccinelli said, is currently \"seeking hundreds of people to fill key positions in law enforcement, travel security, emergency prevention, response, & management, as well as cybersecurity, IT, & intel analysis.\"\n\nIt is unclear what impact the $1 billion cut to funding will have on the NYPD, which had a budget of nearly $6 billion for the 2020 fiscal year.\n\nAs it stands, the NYPD has the largest police force in the U.S., with more than 55,000 people employed with the department. Approximately 36,000 of those employees are officers, while 19,000 are civilian employees.\n\nThe NYPD is not the only police department to face change in the wake of Floyd's death, which has seen countless people around the world take to the streets to protest against police brutality and for systemic racism to be addressed.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Los Angeles City Council approved a $150 million cut to the Los Angeles Police Department's budget for the 2021 fiscal year.\n\nAs part of the decision, city lawmakers said police officer roles would also be reduced, with the department expected to see the number of officers it employs brought down to 9,757, a level of staffing that has not been seen in L.A. since 2008 .\n\nMeanwhile, city lawmakers in Minneapolis, where Floyd was killed, have vowed to disband their local police department and replace it with an entirely new public safety system.\n\nThat system will focus on \"transformative\" justice, which involves a more community-based approach to addressing conflict and other issues that typically result in police being called.\n\nChantal Da Silva is Chief Correspondent at Newsweek , with a focus on immigration and human rights.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nIt's been nearly a month since New York City police officer Jonathan Diller 's funeral, the first NYC cop to lose his life in the line of duty in two years. America knows the names of the few bad cops in America who abuse their power. But they need to know the names of the good cops too, especially those who gave their lives protecting us from the evil and peril around us. Which is why Americans need to know the story of Jonathan Diller . Not just how he died but how he lived.\n\nDiller, who joined the NYPD in 2021, lost his life doing the kind of routine work cops do that can quickly turn deadly. He and his partner were investigating an illegally parked SUV in the Far Rockaway section of Queens when a 34-year-old with a long rap sheet pulled out a gun and opened fire at the officers. Diller was hit in the torso just below his bulletproof vest. He was rushed to Jamaica Hospital, but his wounds were too severe.\n\nHis funeral was a solemn affair as friends and fellow policemen-thousands of cops from across the tristate area-gathered inside and outside St. Rose of Lima Roman Catholic Church in Massapequa, the cry of bagpipes and drums echoing through the streets as Diller's flag-draped casket made its way through the crowd. There were several speakers, none more moving than his wife, Stephanie, who stood at the podium alongside her 1-year-old son, Ryan.\n\nI am so proud that thousands of people around the country are calling Jonathan a hero, but the truth is he has always been a hero to Ryan and me. The rest of the world is just catching up.\n\nStephanie talked about Jonathan's family life, his upbringing in Long Island and the type of guy he was when he was young.\n\nHe grew up taking memorable ski trips with his family, playing lacrosse and hockey and forming friendships that would last a lifetime. He was a connector. The kind of guy that would draw people in and find something in common with everyone. A friend to everyone.\n\nStephanie also talked about how she met her husband.\n\nI remember on one of our very first dates we went to see a movie. He was so tired from work that he fell asleep in the movie theater. He was snoring so loudly that the people around me asked me to wake him up [laughs]. But if you ever asked him the story, I was the one who fell asleep, started snoring and embarrassed him [more laughs].\n\nStephanie then talked about her relationship with her husband. The laughs quickly turned to tears.\n\nI never doubted how much Jonathan loved me because he always told me. He was absolutely my soulmate and we could just understand each other with a look. Anytime I entered a room, I looked for him and knew that the place I belonged was the spot next to him. We had a connection that not many people get to experience in their lifetime.\n\nHolding back tears, Stephanie took a moment to describe her wedding day.\n\nIn November of 2019 at our wedding, I remember being so nervous to walk down the aisle in front of so many people. But as soon as the church doors opened, I saw him look at me and I realized how lucky I was. He looked at me like I was his whole world. And he always treated me like I was his whole world.\n\nShe described her life with Jonathan after the wedding.\n\nTogether we lived a very simple life in Massapequa. We worked hard, we relaxed at home, we cooked, and we had the cutest dog in the world, Tucker. We did everything together, and I really mean that. We were best friends. He would call us Batman and Robin, but he said I was Batman and he was Robin.\n\nStephanie then described her husband's decision to leave his job at his family's business and join the NYPD.\n\nEveryone was so proud he found something he loved to do, and he was exceptional at it. He would go in early, stay late and work overtime because he just loved it. It was no surprise he was an incredible police officer when you think about the type of man he was. He was always putting people above himself, dropping everything to help someone in need and speaking up for what was right. He was a fierce protector of everyone around him.\n\nShe talked about her husband's best role of them all: fatherhood.\n\nJonathan always wanted to be a dad, and he wasted no time being the greatest one. I will never forget the look on his face when our son was born. I don't think we could ever achieve a greater happiness. Jonathan wanted nothing more than to show Ryan off to anyone and everyone he knew. He was excited that Ryan's first word was \"Dadda,\" and I remember I would playfully try to get him to say \"Mamma\" instead. But now I never want to stop hearing Ryan say \"Dadda\" to me [crying].\n\nStephanie then described the day that changed her world-and her son's-forever.\n\nOur lives were pretty much perfect until five days ago, when everything changed forever. He was called into duty, and in typical Jonathan fashion he didn't run away. He did what was right, and he did what he loved. He wasn't the type to sugarcoat anything, so I won't sugarcoat this: This is devastating. It's a senseless, tragic loss for so many. Our family, our friends and the entire city of New York. It's a shame that someone who brought so much positivity to the world was given such a negative ending.\n\nStephanie wasn't finished, as she continued with these heartbreaking words.\n\nThere was so much he was looking forward to, like watching his siblings build a life with their spouses, seeing his friends become fathers and watching his son grow. It breaks my heart that Ryan was robbed of getting to grow up with his dad. Jonathan had so many things he wanted to teach him, like how to play ice hockey, how to drive a car, ride a bike, to watch Ryan go to his first day of school and watch him graduate on his last.\n\nHolding back tears, Stephanie closed things out with these words:\n\nIt's hard to imagine how long I have to wait to see Jonathan again. When the doors of heaven open for me one day, I hope to see Jonathan standing there looking at me just like he did on our wedding day. My husband died a hero, but he also lived as one. Rest in peace Jonathan - the man who captured my heart, and now all of New York's.\n\nStephanie Diller's words were a stark reminder that the men and women serving to protect us across America-the 700,000-plus cops and sheriffs and federal agents-are overwhelmingly good and decent people. Good men and women who go to work each day to protect and serve-and sometimes never return home.\n\nNewsletters in your inbox See all\n\nCompany\n\nEditions:\n\nContact\n\nTerms of Use\n\n© 2025 NEWSWEEK DIGITAL LLC"

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nA judge has found that New York City overstepped its bounds by firing police officers who defied its COVID vaccine mandate, ordering that they be given their jobs back.\n\nNew York State Supreme Court Judge Lyle Frank on Friday ruled in favor of the Police Benevolent Association (PBA), which cheered the decision as a victory for officers' rights. The ruling follows other legal setbacks for government attempts to require public workers to get inoculated against COVID.\n\n\"This decision confirms what we have said from the start: the vaccine mandate was an improper infringement on our members' right to make personal medical decisions in consultation with their own health care professionals,\" PBA President Patrick Lynch said in a statement. \"We will continue to fight to protect those rights.\"\n\nThe New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene referred Newsweek's request for comment to the city's Law Department.\n\nNicholas Paolucci, spokesperson for the Law Department, told Newsweek that it would immediately appeal the ruling, which freezes the judge's decision.\n\n\"It is at odds with every other court decision upholding the mandate as a condition of employment,\" he said.\n\nThe association, which represents over 50,000 active and retired officers in the New York Police Department ( NYPD ), brought the lawsuit in October 2021 , calling the mandate a \"draconian imposition\" and asking that it be put on hold.\n\nBill de Blasio, then mayor of the country's most populous city, imposed the mandate on the entire municipal workforce to get the jab by November 1 or be placed on unpaid leave. At the time, 68 percent of the NYPD force was vaccinated , lower than the 76 percent rate of adults in the city.\n\nWhile the city argued that it had the authority to mandate vaccinations, Frank wrote in his four-page ruling that \"its enforcement measure is limited to monetary fines\" and that any conditions of employment needed to be worked out with the union representing police.\n\n\"To say that this Court should read into the statute that enforcement of a vaccine mandate is enforceable by exclusion from the workplace, suspension, leave without pay and ultimate termination would be a gross overstatement of the (city Department of Health and Mental Hygiene) Commissioner's powers,\" Frank wrote.\n\nPolice forces across the country have been particularly resistant to COVID vaccine mandates enacted by local jurisdictions in an effort to bring the pandemic to heel. Nationally, the Supreme Court blocked the Biden administration's requirement.\n\nNew York City government has been working out resistance to its vaccine requirements for public employees. Before leaving office, de Blasio reached an agreement with four of the city's labor unions regarding the vaccine mandate, including guidelines for medical and religious exemptions, as well as unpaid leave.\n\nThe office of New York City Mayor Eric Adams in February fired 1,430 city workers who failed to comply with the city's vaccine mandate. The same month, Adams began relaxing mask mandates and proof of vaccination as the pandemic showed signs of waning in the city that once saw one of the fastest spreads of the virus.\n\nAdams on Tuesday announced that the city dropped its mandate that students be vaccinated in order to participate in school sports and extracurricular activities, reported PIX11 . The city was also abandoning its mandate for private employers but keeping the requirement for municipal workers.\n\n\"Many people think COVID is in our rearview mirror,\" Adams said, according to the station. \"It will remain in the rearview mirror if we do the right things.\"\n\nUpdate 9/26/22, 4:50 p.m. ET: This story has been updated with comment from the NYC Law Department and further context.\n\nJake Thomas is a Newsweek night reporter based in Portland, Oregon.

      "text": "The NYPD Took 7 Years To Fire This Cop. Then the Union Hired Him.\n\nPolice\n\nJoe Lancaster | 5.28.2024 3:20 PM\n\nOne of the reasons that it can be so difficult to hold police officers accountable is due to the incredible power wielded by police unions . Even when departments are willing and able to fire bad cops, unions can often get them reinstated, usually at great expense to taxpayers.\n\nAs it turns out, even if it can't save a bad cop's job, the union itself may just hire him.\n\nThe New York Post reported that Hugh Barry, a former sergeant with the New York City Police Department (NYPD), is now employed with the Sergeants Benevolent Association (SBA), the police union that specifically represents NYPD sergeants.\n\nBarry was fired from the NYPD after shooting and killing 66-year-old Deborah Danner in October 2016. Barry was among multiple officers responding to a noise complaint against Danner, a black woman who had struggled with schizophrenia for three decades. According to The New York Times , after Barry persuaded her to put down a pair of scissors she was holding, Danner allegedly \"picked up a baseball bat and tried to swing\" it at him, at which point he shot her twice. (An EMT would later testify that Danner had already put down the scissors by the time Barry arrived, and she only picked up the bat after he tried unsuccessfully to grab her.)\n\nBoth then-Mayor Bill de Blasio and then-Police Commissioner James O'Neill quickly condemned the shooting, with de Blasio calling it \"tragic and unacceptable\" and O'Neill stating, \"We failed.\" They faulted Barry for deploying his firearm instead of a less lethal alternative like a Taser. De Blasio and O'Neill promised a thorough investigation, and Barry was suspended within hours of the shooting.\n\nIn May 2017, Barry was charged with second-degree murder, first- and second-degree manslaughter, and criminally negligent homicide. In February 2018, Barry was acquitted of all charges in a bench trial.\n\nBut while the department moved to fire Barry after the shooting, he would not face any administrative proceedings until January 2022 -after which NYPD officials waited over 18 months before deciding his fate. In September 2023, the department finally forced him out, nearly seven years after he killed Danner.\n\nBarry shot and killed a woman under questionable circumstances, and both the police commissioner and the mayor immediately criticized his conduct. While he would be acquitted by a judge on criminal charges, the city would later pay $2 million to settle a lawsuit brought by Danner's sister, who was present at the shooting.\n\nAnd yet it took nearly seven years for the NYPD to fire Barry, who was placed on \"modified\" duty after the trial, which entails nonenforcement tasks; he earned $152,000 in 2020 alone, as his employer was actively pursuing his termination.\n\nEvery step of the way, the SBA-Barry's union, as an NYPD sergeant-supported him and pushed for his reinstatement. In June 2017, just two weeks after Barry's indictment, the SBA ran a full-page ad in the New York Post and the New York Daily News , in which SBA President Ed Mullins charged that Barry was \"being used as a pawn in political gamesmanship.\" In the following years, the union tweeted numerous times from its official account, invoking Barry positively when commenting on unrelated stories. After his acquittal, Mullins said Barry \"was wronged all along\" and added that he \"should be restored to full duty.\"\n\n(In August 2023, just weeks before Barry was officially terminated from the NYPD, a federal judge sentenced Mullins to two years in federal prison after he pleaded guilty to embezzling $600,000 from the SBA.)\n\nGiven its consistent support, it's perhaps unsurprising that the SBA would then choose to hire Barry, who as of this writing is listed on the union's website as a \"reimbursement coordinator.\"\n\nIn practice, police unions' primary purpose seems to be shielding bad cops from accountability and defending their conduct no matter what. In 2020, two officers with the Buffalo Police Department shoved an unarmed 75-year-old man , whose head hit the pavement and started bleeding. An arbitrator hired by the police union later sided with the officers, determining that the man's fall \"might well have had as much to do with the fact that he was holding objects in each hand or his advanced age\" as the fact that he was forcibly pushed.\n\nBetween October 2015 and March 2021, the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Department reinstated 37 terminated officers-17 of whom had been deemed a \"threat to safety\"-after arbitrators overruled the department, costing district taxpayers $14.3 million.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

Caban today announced efforts being taken to make the Metropolitan Transit Authority's (MTA) subway system safer by investing in new technology to detect firearms, as well as invest in more clinicians that will help those suffering from severe mental illness in the nation's largest subway system. The city is exploring, and will soon begin piloting, emerging technologies designed to detect weapons carried by travelers into the transit system. In accordance with the Public Oversight of Surveillance Technology (POST) Act, the NYPD also published online its Impact and Use Policy for electromagnetic weapons detection systems, starting a mandatory 90-day waiting period before new technology can be tested and used in New York City. Additionally, Mayor Adams announced that the city will begin hiring clinicians to support the expansion of the Subway Co-Response Outreach Teams (SCOUT), a pilot program launched in partnership with the state and the MTA to connect people with untreated severe mental illness in the subways to mental health treatment and care.\n\n\"Keeping New Yorkers safe on the subway and maintaining confidence in the system is key to ensuring that New York remains the safest big city in America,\" said Mayor Adams . \"Today's announcement is the next step in our ongoing efforts to keep dangerous weapons out of our transit system and to provide greater mental health services for New Yorkers in crisis. By kicking off a 90-day waiting period to test electromagnetic weapons detection systems here in New York City and hiring more clinicians for SCOUT, we are showing our administration's dedication to keeping all New Yorkers safe.\"\n\n\"Since the start of my administration, Mayor Adams and I have worked together closely to keep the subways safe for all New Yorkers,\" said New York Governor Kathy Hochul. \"This month, I announced a five-point plan to improve safety in the subways, including dedicating $20 million to expand the SCOUT program, which will help more New Yorkers receive the treatment they need. The new technology announced today builds on our existing commitments to place cameras throughout the system and will help law enforcement keep dangerous weapons out of the system.\"\n\n\"People with untreated serious mental illness taking refuge in the subway system deserve safety, stability, and community,\" said Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services Anne Williams-Isom . \"The journey to this destination takes time, but the first step is often the hardest: connecting a person with medical care that they may not recognize they need. This is the critical mission of our SCOUT teams. Through a co-response model, SCOUT empowers our caring clinicians to engage with New Yorkers in crisis, assess their needs, and respond accordingly. We are heartened by the results so far, excited for the possibilities with this expansion, and grateful to our MTA partners for their shared determination to get this right.\"\n\n\"The brave men and women of the NYPD are averaging more than 4,500 gun arrests a year since the start of this administration and have taken well over 15,000 illegal firearms off New York City streets so far,\" said NYPD Commissioner Caban . \"At the same time, overall crime in our transit system continues to trend downward as our officers actively engage lawbreakers each day and night. To make these achievements meaningful for all New Yorkers, however, we must make safety a reality in every community we serve, on every train line we protect. We are doing that by remaining laser-focused on the relatively small number of people who commit violent crimes, by deploying our resources effectively, by maximizing the utility of new technology, and by constantly evaluating our performance in a relentless effort to do even better.\"\n\n\"Riders have to feel safe when riding the subways and that requires innovation - new weapons detection technology, but also increased deployments of police, tougher handling of repeat offenders by the criminal justice system, and expanded resources for mental health,\" said MTA Chair and CEO Janno Lieber. \"Thankfully, Mayor Adams and Governor Hochul get it and continue to fight for the millions of people who rely on the transit system.\"\n\nDuring the 90-day waiting period, the NYPD will be working to identify companies with proven expertise in weapons detection technology. At the end of the waiting period, a pilot program will be instituted in some subway stations where the NYPD will be able to further evaluate the equipment's effectiveness.\n\nAs of Sunday, March 24, 2024, NYPD officers have seized a total of 450 weapons - including 19 illegal guns - in the New York City transit system this year, compared to 261 weapons - including nine guns - during the same period last year. The NYPD also seized 1,515 weapons in the subway system in 2023, including 1,470 cutting instruments and 45 illegal firearms. That tally was a stark increase from the previous year, when 947 total weapons were seized, including 912 cutting instruments and 35 guns.\n\nLast month, Mayor Adams directed the NYPD to surge an additional 1,000 police officers into the subway system each day to keep help New Yorkers safe. Additionally, earlier this week, the NYPD announced \"Operation Fare Play,\" an initiative to ensure people pay their fare when entering the subway system by deploying 800 more police officers into the subway system to crack down on fare evasion. Through Sunday, overall crime in the transit system was down nearly 16 percent for the month of March, compared to the same month last year, adding to February's 15.4 percent month-over-month decrease in crime in the subway system. Since the start of 2024, overall arrests in the subway system are up nearly 56 percent compared to last year, including a 78 percent increase in fare-evasion arrests and a 111 percent jump in gun arrests.\n\nLaunched in October 2023, the SCOUT pilot program has operated with two teams in the subways focused on connecting those with untreated severe mental illness with mental health support and long-term care. SCOUT teams are comprised of a clinician and two MTA police officers, and, in the 90 days of operation, the two teams have moved 90 individuals out of the subway system and into care. Earlier this month, Governor Hochul announced a $20 million investment to scale this pilot and bring the total number of SCOUT teams to 10 by the end of 2025. With this investment from the state, the city will begin hiring additional clinicians to support the expansion of SCOUT and reach even more New Yorkers in need of care.\n\npressoffice@cityhall.nyc.gov (212) 788-2958"

      "text": "NYPD Will Spend Nearly $400 Million to Hide its Radio Communications\n\nPolice\n\nC.J. Ciaramella | 11.22.2023 11:27 AM\n\nThe New York Police Department (NYPD) will spend nearly $400 million to upgrade its radio system, including encrypting its communications channels, which the public has been able to tune into since 1932.\n\nAt a New York City Council meeting Monday, NYPD Chief of Information Technology Ruben Beltran said the upgrade, expected to cost $390 million, will be completed by the end of next year, replacing the old analog radio network with a fully encrypted digital system.\n\nThe move is part of a growing trend. Over the last decade, other large police departments in Chicago , Baltimore , Washington, D.C. , and Portland have all encrypted their radio communications or are planning to do so. Departments say broadcasting in the clear gives criminals advance warning. Beltran said encryption would also protect the information of crime victims and block pranksters who jam up NYPD frequencies. (The NYPD regularly leaks information on arrestees and even victims for political purposes.)\n\nHowever, scanner enthusiasts, news organizations, and elected officials complain that encrypted radio is cutting off a longstanding and useful source of information on police activity. As Gothamist reported , NYPD radio chatter has been the source of several major news stories over the years:\n\nThe New York Daily News obtained the crucial video of Officer Daniel Pantaleo killing Eric Garner thanks to a call that came over the police radio in Staten Island. As tens of thousands of peaceful demonstrators flooded the streets in June 2020, Gothamist recorded NYPD officers on radio airwaves using threatening language about the protesters, including saying that officers should run protesters over and shoot them. Responding, one officer was recorded saying \"don't put that over air.\"\n\nPolice frequencies going dark is especially challenging for photojournalists, who rely on scanners to get to emergency scenes as fast as possible. The Chicago Police Department is considering a 30-minute public broadcast delay to allow news organizations to still hear dispatch calls.\n\nResponding to concerns from council members, Beltran wouldn't commit to similar policies, but he alleged that the NYPD \"is the most transparent police force in the country,\" a statement so removed from reality that it can only be considered comedy.\n\nThe NYPD is notorious for flouting the state's Freedom of Information Law (FOIL). Every reporter in New York City knows that filing a records request to the NYPD is a complete waste of time unless you're willing to file a lawsuit, too.\n\nSpeaking of which, the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project (STOP), a New York watchdog group, filed a lawsuit in March alleging that the NYPD unlawfully refuses to respond to FOIL requests. The suit cited delays in 42,000 public records requests filed over the past four years to the NYPD. For example, I've been waiting since June 2020 for disciplinary records on the officers who fatally shot Amadou Diallo in 1999.\n\n\"The idea that we're going to turn this sort of vital information into something that's only accessible to the public at the whims of police is just truly chilling,\" Albert Fox Cahn, the executive director of the STOP, said of radio encryption to The New York Times .\n\nIn unrelated news, the New York City public library system is cutting Sunday service as a result of budget cuts.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Bill de Blasio Says the NYPD Should Warn People Not To Be Haters\n\nBill de Blasio\n\nRobby Soave | 3.18.2021 4:54 PM\n\nIn a press conference today, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio suggested that one way to combat anti-Asian hate would be for the New York Police Department to warn people not to be hateful.\n\n\"Even if something is not a criminal case, a perpetrator being confronted by the city, whether it's NYPD or another agency, and being told that what they've done was very hurtful to another person and could have ever repeated lead to criminal charges, that's another important piece of the puzzle,\" said de Blasio. \"One of the things officers are trained to do is to give warnings. If someone has done something wrong, but not rising to a criminal level, it's perfectly appropriate for an NYPD officer to talk to them, to say that was not appropriate.\"\n\nAs de Blasio appeared to recognize, merely expressing hateful speech is not a crime. Hate speech is in fact protected by the First Amendment. For something to count as a hate crime , there must be underlying illegal behavior, such as assault or vandalism.\n\nIt is thus a very bad idea for the NYPD to go around sternly lecturing people who may have engaged in hateful conduct that is not actually illegal. For one thing, this straightforwardly violates people's civil liberties: Unless you're committing a crime, your actions are no business of the government's.\n\nBeyond that, there's always a risk that routine interactions between cops and citizens will escalate into something life-threatening. Give cops more reasons to knock on people's doors and bother them, and you increase the chances of a bad encounter. This was a central theme of last year's protests against abusive policing. De Blasio's plan for combatting racism hinges on doing the exact opposite of what Black Lives Matter and other anti-racist groups have been urging.\n\nCops' time is better spent investigating violent crime than warning people not to be haters. Someone should explain to de Blasio that there's not always a great deal of trust between cops and the communities they serve, and that his proposal is likely to worsen the problem.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Police Unions Lose Bid To Block Release of Huge Trove of NYPD Misconduct Records\n\nNYPD\n\nC.J. Ciaramella | 8.21.2020 5:15 PM\n\nA coalition of New York City police, firefighter, and prison guard unions have lost their bid to block the city's planned release of a huge trove of police misconduct records. The ruling clears the way, at least for the moment, for New York City's Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) to post officers' complaint histories, and for the New York Police Department to release separate disciplinary records it holds.\n\nAll those records had been confidential for the past 40 years under Section 50-a, a notorious police secrecy law . But the New York legislature repealed the law in June-a stinging defeat for police unions, who are still bitterly fighting to claw back what records they can. Today U.S. District Judge Katherine Polk Failla declined to grant a preliminary injunction barring New York City from releasing unsubstantiated misconduct allegations.\n\n\"Whoa!\" an unidentified person on an unmuted line shouted during the telephonic court hearing, as Failla announced she was almost totally rejecting the police unions' request.\n\nLast month, Failla temporarily blocked New York City from disclosing the records while she weighed the unions' arguments that the release of unsubstantiated complaints would lead to retaliation against police officers and harm their reputations and future employment prospects.\n\nBut before the unions filed their lawsuit, the review board released misconduct records to the New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU) and ProPublica , the latter of which published its own database of more than 4,000 complaints. A court initially blocked the NYCLU from releasing its records, but yesterday the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals lifted that stay as well.\n\nThe NYCLU immediately published a database of more than 320,000 complaints filed against the city's police officers since 1985. The New York Times reports that only 3 percent of those complaints were substantiated.\n\nToday Failla ruled that the unions had failed to demonstrate the release would cause concrete harms or risks for officers.\n\n\"Plaintiffs have presented speculation only that these disclosures will increase risk of officer harm,\" Failla said, noting that such records are public in a dozen other states.\n\nFailla did, however, grant a narrow injunction blocking the city from releasing records on certain low-level disciplinary offenses that can be expunged under the officers' collective bargaining agreement.\n\nCCRB Chair Fred Davie said in a press release today that this outcome \"is not only legally justified, but is the only logical path forward for preserving what New Yorkers and lawmakers intended through the repeal of 50-a. I applaud today's decision-the fight for transparency has been delayed, but not deterred.\"\n\nThe unions have until Monday afternoon to appeal Failla's ruling to the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "How Crime Fighting and Criminal Justice Reform Go Hand in Hand\n\nAn interview with Bill Bratton, former NYPD commissioner.\n\nBill Bratton has been here before. If anyone involved in the conversation around policing and rising crime rates in America's largest cities can claim to feel a sense of deja vu , it's the man who is arguably America's best-known and most respected cop. Bratton has run the police departments in three major U.S. cities: Boston, New York, and Los Angeles. But it was his first stint in Gotham, where he and Rudy Giuliani oversaw a dramatic decrease in crime rates in the 1990s, that earned him a supercop reputation-and means he will forever be a New Yorker.\n\nBratton has leaned into that identity. He has long been a fixture of the Manhattan scene. He dials into our Zoom call from his weekend home in the Hamptons. Now 73 and installed in a plush private-sector sinecure, Bratton still sports a chunky gold and blue ring, a finger-width replica of his NYPD commissioner's badge.\n\nAs soon as Bratton starts talking, however, he is unmistakably Bostonian, his accent revealing the town where, as he recounts in his new memoir The Profession , he \"grew up in a working-class family on the second floor of a three-decker\" and where, as a child, \"he wanted to be a police officer since before I can remember.\" And though he is out of uniform, Bratton is still the face of American policing to an extent that few active police leaders can claim to be.\n\nIt's a tough time for law enforcement. Crime is rising and morale is low. Many large cities have heeded demands by activists to cut funding to their police departments. Others are \"reimagining\" public safety. And many officers don't seem to like what that vision looks like. Retirements are up 45 percent and resignations up 18 percent nationwide. In big cities, the numbers are even higher.\n\nBefore getting into all of that, however, I ask Bratton about the nine minutes that set much of this in motion. \"I've not seen anything like it in my career, and I've been in and around policing for 50 years,\" he says of the murder of George Floyd. \"I just couldn't understand. I was shocked by it, angered by it.\"\n\nBratton starts to say that he knew what would happen next but corrects himself: \"Actually, I failed to recognize just how serious the repercussions were going to be. I don't think anyone could have anticipated, watching, what the results were going to be over the ensuing days, weeks and months. There was so much going on when George Floyd occurred and, when it happened, it was so egregious that it wasn't like throwing a match on all that kindling. It was like throwing a torch onto it. And it exploded.\"\n\nOne of those unanticipated consequences was the emergence of the idea of defunding the police. \"It's one of the stupidest phrases that's ever been concocted,\" says Bratton. \"And it boomeranged very badly on them. It was the phrase of the moment but when Democrats saw that Republicans were using it as a battering ram, they ran like hell away from it, appropriately so.\"\n\nNot quickly enough, however, to stop many cities from turning defund the police from slogan to policy. Last year, major cities across the country slashed police budgets. In New York, Bill de Blasio cut funding for the NYPD by $1 billion. Shortly after Floyd's death, Minneapolis's city council voted to \"dismantle\" its police department. But in the face of growing discontent about rising crime, many municipalities have reversed course. Minneapolis has backed away from its more radical plans. According to the Wall Street Journal , \"in the nation's 20 largest local law-enforcement agencies, city and county leaders want funding increases for nine of the 12 departments where next year's budgets already have been proposed. As Bratton sees it, the folly of the defund movement lies in the reality that \"so much of what the social justice and criminal justice movement are looking for actually calls for more expansive funding of the police. For better training, better research.\"\n\nPerhaps the most surprising thing about these funding decisions is that they were made against a backdrop of rising violent crime rates. In New York, for example, shootings have been on the rise for more than a year, and in the first five months of 2021 reached their highest level since 2002 . Murders in the city jumped by 44 percent between 2019 and 2020. The cause of those increases is the source of considerable debate, but Bratton pushes back against the progressive argument that the pandemic and associated economic hardship is the primary cause of the problem. \"New York was already struggling,\" says Bratton. \"The city's crime problem began to accelerate after the legislature in the state passed their bail reform act [in 2019].\"\n\nBratton calls this move, which abolished cash bail for the majority of crimes, \"a bridge too far.\" He argues that there need not be a tradeoff between law and order and criminal justice reform. \"If you look at New York in 2018, in many respects we were there. We had reduced the jail population to about 9,000 from an average back in the '90s of 22,000. We were reducing the number of arrests and summonses. Cops were freed up from proactive policing and dealing with crime and disorder because there was so little of it left.\"\n\nThis, Bratton says, meant there would be more time for exactly the kind of community engagement and relationship-building that can help relations between the police and minority communities. \"But to the legislature in Albany it was as if none of this reform had happened,\" he says.\n\nIn Bratton's view, crime waves are referred to as epidemics for a reason: \"It expands extremely rapidly, as we've seen with the coronavirus, but if you find the right measures, the right vaccines, it can decline just as rapidly.\" As with public health crises, the policies needed in the midst of an outbreak are not the same as those needed when the numbers are under control again. \"Isn't that what happened in New York?\" asks Bratton rhetorically. \"We rapidly grew enforcement activity in the '90s, but then as crime began to go down we were able to start reducing arrests and summonses.\"\n\nThree decades on, Bratton delivers a robust defense of the crime-busting measures with which he made a name for himself in the 1990s. Those policies, which once received bipartisan acclaim, are today viewed more critically among the bien pensant crowd and are the subject of accusations of racism from the left. Broken windows-the philosophy zealously embraced by Bratton and his partner-in-crime-fighting Giuliani, which calls for a zero-tolerance approach to petty offenses to help reduce serious crime-is now a tarnished phrase in many circles. A resolution introduced by House Democrats last year, for example, blamed broken windows for \"mass criminalization, heightened violence, and mass incarceration that disproportionately impacts black and brown people.\"\n\n\"I make no apologies for the activity in the '90s,\" says Bratton. \"Arrests were the medicine that was necessary in [New York] and certainly in Los Angeles because we had no alternative at that time to break the back of the problem in what was an extraordinarily violent time.\"\n\nWhat does Bratton say to the charge of racism? \"What we were targeting was crime,\" he replies. \"Unfortunately for the black population, most of it was occurring in their neighborhoods. Most of the victims were black or brown. We'd have been accused of neglect if we hadn't attempted to deal with that crime problem.\"\n\n\"Broken windows,\" Bratton continues, \"is the very essence of what everyone claims they want, that is community policing. What are the problems that they want prioritized and they want prevented? What are the problems that come into the NYPD every day in the thousands? Broken windows. Get rid of the prostitute in my hallway, get rid of the kids smoking dope up on the roof, get rid of the gang on the corner keeping me awake all hours of the night. Those are broken windows. And who is complaining about those broken windows? People in our poor neighborhoods.\"\n\nTo accusations that police target black and brown communities, Bratton responds with a question of his own: \"Why are the police in those neighborhoods? Because people are calling the police. This is the tension right now in the reform movement. They claim to be representing the interests of the poor and minorities, but who is in fact calling the police? It's the poor and the minorities.\"\n\nFor all that Bratton delivers a resolute defense of his record-and the case for robust policing-he is also open to the charge of blind spots and unintended consequences: \"What have we learned since then? We are now much more mindful that a lot of the laws passed back in that era are having a compounding effect on trying to reintroduce some of those people back into society. ... So the criminal justice reform effort of today is to try to find ways that people will still be punished for committing a crime but that you don't give them an effective life sentence.\"\n\nHe also acknowledges that even today, and even in cities like New York and Washington, D.C., where the police rank-and-file is majority minority, law enforcement often fails to treat citizens in a way that is \"constitutional, compassionate, and consistent.\"\n\n\"The black population is demanding: Treat us the same way as you treat others,\" says Bratton. \"We're still not always seeing people the way they want to be seen.\"\n\nWhen he returned to the NYPD commissioner's office for a second time, under Bill DeBlasio in 2014, curbing high stop-and-frisk rates in the city became a priority. A medicine that may have been necessary in the 1990s had grown counterproductive by the 2010s. As Bratton writes in The Profession , \"the numbers ceased to be a means to an end and became an end in and of themselves.\" Under his predecessor Ray Kelly, stops in the city had soared to nearly 700,000 a year. By 2015, the figure was 22,565 .\n\nTime and again, Bratton returns to the idea that crime fighting and criminal justice reform can go hand in hand. As he sees it, the former makes the latter possible. The choice between public order and a fair and equitable system of justice is a false one. Instead the challenge is getting the right prescription at the right time. \"It's fascinating when you look at just how many similarities there are between medicine and policing,\" he says.\n\nIf police chiefs are having a tough time of it in contemporary American politics, then so too are self-styled \"centrists\" like Bratton. To run a police department is, argues Bratton, almost by definition, to be stuck in the middle \"with partisan politics raging\" all around. He reaches for an expression of Teddy Roosevelt's to describe the police chief's position: \"the man in the arena, bloodied and battered,\" he paraphrases. \"That's the American police chief today, black or white, male or female. ... The role of the police chief in America today is probably the most difficult it's ever been not only because of the politics of the moment but the challenges of the moment.\"\n\nOne thing that doesn't help is Republican Party's double standard on law and order: on the one hand making the tough-on-crime, back-the-blue argument, on the other explaining away the violence of an attack on, among other things, law enforcement, at the U.S, Capitol on January 6. \"Thank God for the actions of those cops that day,\" says Bratton. \"The reaction of the Republican Party and many individuals in that party has been obscene. ... It's an extraordinary source of frustration for me to see attacks on policing and support for those thousands of anarchists who were trying to overthrow our government that day. I'm very concerned for our country at the moment. And I'm very concerned for the policing profession who are right in the middle of it all.\"\n\nIt is a gloomy note to end on, I say. \"I always find hope,\" says Bratton. \"Nobody thought we could get New York out of the morass it found itself in after 25 years of crime increases. Mario Cuomo said maybe this is as good as it gets. But I was an optimist who thought we could do something about it. I still remain optimistic about the future. But we've got a very, very rough road ahead.\"\n\nYour membership includes the ability to share articles\n                with friends.

      "text": "Did Hillary Clinton's Emails Include Evidence of Child Sex Trafficking?\n\nNo.\n\nA viral Facebook post claims to show images that were found on the laptops of Hillary Clinton and Anthony Weiner. The post has been shared 6,700 times and viewed 1.3 million times, and it is part of the Pizzagate conspiracy, which claims that Clinton and other politicians and celebrities are involved in a child sex-trafficking ring. Warning to readers: Several of the images in the Facebook post are highly graphic.\n\nThe first image is of a girl with the caption: \"This was found and [sic] Hillary Clinton email and She [sic] was 15 years old.\" The girl in the image is Scarlett Keeling , a 15-year-old British tourist who was sexually assaulted and killed in India in February 2008. There is not the slightest bit of evidence to connect Clinton to the crime-a man named Samson D'Souza was convicted of \"culpable homicide not amounting to murder\" in July 2019. Clinton's email scandal was regarding her use of a private server as secretary of state, an office she didn't assume until almost a year after Keeling was killed. The WikiLeaks' archive of Clinton's leaked emails goes from June 30, 2010 to August 12, 2014, and does not return any results for searches of \"Scarlett Keeling\" or any variations of her name or words associated with her case. There is no evidence that any of the other images the post purports are from Clinton emails either.\n\nAnother image shows what appears to be a mutilated child, with a caption claiming that Clinton cut the girl's face off. The picture is, in fact, the highly graphic cover of a 1997 heavy metal album titled \" Verses of the Bleeding \" by band Abnegation. The picture on Facebook has another caption, allegedly a quote from a New York Police Department chief:  \"'What's in the emails is staggering and as a father, it turned my stomach,' the NYPD Chief said. 'There is not going to be any Houdini-like escape from what we found. We have copies of everything. We will ship them to WikiLeaks or I will personally hold my own press conference if it comes to that.'\"\n\nThe quote from the \"NYPD Chief\" is from a 2016 article -accurately described in a Vox article as \"transparently silly\"-published by True Pundit , a website infamous for spreading misinformation and conspiracies . Despite the promise in the 2016 article, the emails supposedly proving Clinton engaged in a litany of crimes, including sex with minors, never surfaced.\n\nAnother one of the images is a screenshot of an article that states that \"There were a total of 12 individuals who saw Anthony Weiner's Laptop (sic) computer, 9 of those 12 people are dead now.\" The article is from the site News from the Perimeter , and cites the aforementioned True Pundit article as a source. It also does not say who any of the nine deceased individuals are, but does list Weiner and his ex-wife and Clinton aide Huma Abedin as two of the three who are still alive.

      "text": "Did Hillary Clinton's Emails Include Evidence of Child Sex Trafficking?\n\nNo.\n\nA viral Facebook post claims to show images that were found on the laptops of Hillary Clinton and Anthony Weiner. The post has been shared 6,700 times and viewed 1.3 million times, and it is part of the Pizzagate conspiracy, which claims that Clinton and other politicians and celebrities are involved in a child sex-trafficking ring. Warning to readers: Several of the images in the Facebook post are highly graphic.\n\nThe first image is of a girl with the caption: \"This was found and [sic] Hillary Clinton email and She [sic] was 15 years old.\" The girl in the image is Scarlett Keeling , a 15-year-old British tourist who was sexually assaulted and killed in India in February 2008. There is not the slightest bit of evidence to connect Clinton to the crime-a man named Samson D'Souza was convicted of \"culpable homicide not amounting to murder\" in July 2019. Clinton's email scandal was regarding her use of a private server as secretary of state, an office she didn't assume until almost a year after Keeling was killed. The WikiLeaks' archive of Clinton's leaked emails goes from June 30, 2010 to August 12, 2014, and does not return any results for searches of \"Scarlett Keeling\" or any variations of her name or words associated with her case. There is no evidence that any of the other images the post purports are from Clinton emails either.\n\nAnother image shows what appears to be a mutilated child, with a caption claiming that Clinton cut the girl's face off. The picture is, in fact, the highly graphic cover of a 1997 heavy metal album titled \" Verses of the Bleeding \" by band Abnegation. The picture on Facebook has another caption, allegedly a quote from a New York Police Department chief:  \"'What's in the emails is staggering and as a father, it turned my stomach,' the NYPD Chief said. 'There is not going to be any Houdini-like escape from what we found. We have copies of everything. We will ship them to WikiLeaks or I will personally hold my own press conference if it comes to that.'\"\n\nThe quote from the \"NYPD Chief\" is from a 2016 article -accurately described in a Vox article as \"transparently silly\"-published by True Pundit , a website infamous for spreading misinformation and conspiracies . Despite the promise in the 2016 article, the emails supposedly proving Clinton engaged in a litany of crimes, including sex with minors, never surfaced.\n\nAnother one of the images is a screenshot of an article that states that \"There were a total of 12 individuals who saw Anthony Weiner's Laptop (sic) computer, 9 of those 12 people are dead now.\" The article is from the site News from the Perimeter , and cites the aforementioned True Pundit article as a source. It also does not say who any of the nine deceased individuals are, but does list Weiner and his ex-wife and Clinton aide Huma Abedin as two of the three who are still alive. It is likely far more people saw the emails, with the NYPD, FBI, Justice Department, and the Manhattan U.S. attorney Preet Bharara all getting involved in the investigation . One very basic challenge to the News from the Perimeter article's math: In addition to Weiner and Abedin, Bharara is still alive as is Andrew McCabe, who served as deputy director of the FBI at the time, and FBI agents Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, all of whom were involved in the investigation into the emails on Weiner's laptop .

      "text": "The Troubling Prevalence of Antisemitic Attacks in Brooklyn\n\nWhat we can learn from the NYPD's hate crime statistics.\n\nThe FBI recently reported hate crime data for 2020 showing that Jews remain widely susceptible to attacks. Fifty-eight percent of religiously motivated attacks in 2020 involved Jewish victims, accounting for 9 percent of all hate crimes last year. While those numbers look grim for a group that makes up only about 2 percent of the American population, they actually mark a slight improvement. During pre-pandemic 2019, when more Americans were regularly out and about, 63 percent of religiously motivated hate crimes targeted Jews, making up 13 percent of that year's total.\n\nThe FBI's crime statistics offer only a partial picture, though. Not only do they not account for non-criminal antisemitic incidents, they also don't explain what happens after hate crimes are reported. It takes some time for the justice system to address arrestees, so it's worth looking back to 2019, the last \"normal\" year for which data exists. New York City offers a good entry point, since NYPD consistently collects hate crime data.\n\nNew Yorkers reported 419 hate crimes to the NYPD in 2019. Of those, 242 incidents, or nearly 58 percent, were antisemitic in nature. And among those 242 reported crimes, 121-exactly half-were Brooklyn-based.\n\nThe true numbers are surely even higher. A 2020 American Jewish Committee report on domestic antisemitism found that 76 percent of American Jews who had experienced antisemitism in the preceding five years never formally reported their experiences.\n\nNew Yorkers absolutely should; the NYPD takes reporting seriously. Their officers made 125 arrests for hate crimes in 2019, 29 of them for antisemitism. But beyond all these numbers, it's worth asking: Who's attacking Brooklyn's Jews, and what happens after they're apprehended?\n\nAmong known attackers , the 29 listed arrests include 25 men and four women. NYPD data characterizes them as black, white, and Asian, and they range from 16 to 47 years old. This is to say, perpetrators have no particular profile.\n\nEight of the \"anti-Jewish\" arrests in Brooklyn's 94th precinct mention a 28-year-old white male, just as three arrests mention a 30-year-old black female in the 71st precinct, and two arrests mention an 18-year-old Asian male in the 66th precinct. NYPD's press office did not respond to requests for comment, but these could be repeat offenders. As New York state Sen. Simcha Felder told me during a phone interview, \"I remember years ago asking, and one of the cops in the unit said that very often it's the same person that's repeatedly doing hate crimes.\"\n\nWhat happens to suspects once they're caught, though? I submitted a Freedom of Information request to the Brooklyn DA in October 2019; the pandemic then delayed my documents. I received information relating to 19 cases, two of which involved the same defendant. My determination letter said six cases weren't released \"because they are sealed,\" so it's unclear if they involved antisemitism.\n\nWhat is knowable: Among all the released cases the FOIL unit considered responsive to my request, only seven incidents clearly involved antisemitism. Asked why the Brooklyn DA's office had pursued only seven of 2019's antisemitic hate crimes, a spokesman emailed, \"We process all hate crimes referred to us but apparently police made arrests on only seven cases.\"\n\nThat's not quite right, though. There is a drop-off between arrests made and cases pursued. According to NYPD's arrest data, 11 of the 29 arrests for antisemitic hate crimes happened in the last three months of 2019. In other words, the NYPD had already made at least 18 arrests before I filed my freedom of information request.\n\nMitchell Silber, executive director of the Community Security Initiative and former director of intelligence analysis for NYPD, told me that cases are unlikely to be prosecuted if the defendant is mentally ill or a juvenile. That presumably explains some of the decline, but not necessarily all.\n\nSince the DA's office provided information about seven cases though, let's consider them:\n\nIn one, a man drew a swastika on the divider in a school bathroom. No court records exist, and the DA's Record Access Officer had no further information.\n\nIn another, a man spray-painted a swastika on a sidewalk. He had Kings County Supreme Court court dates, but like all the following defendants, it's hard to know what's happened. (This taxpayer-funded court requires interested parties to appear in person to request public records.)\n\nIn a third, a man screamed \"Heil Hitler\" and other abusive language, stole the victim's cell phone from his shirt pocket and threw it \"at an oncoming subway train.\"\n\nIn a fourth, a man beat a Hasidic man's chest \"without provocation.\"\n\nIn a fifth, a woman approached a kippah and tzitzit - wearing man with a broken bottle, said \"Hitler should have killed all of you f**king Jews,\" and sprayed an aerosol can at his eyes, causing burning.\n\nIn a sixth, three men knocked an Orthodox Jewish man to the ground, punching and kicking him. He suffered forehead and lip lacerations, in addition to \"substantial pain and suffering.\"\n\nIn a seventh, a woman saw four Jewish children playing in their yard and asked, \"Are you not allowed to be with me because I'm not Jewish?\" The children ran inside screaming. The woman then entered their gated yard, kicked and broke a first floor window, saying, \"Jews, Jews, Jews, I am going to smack those kids,\" along with other menacing comments.\n\nNotably, this list excludes 64-year old Rabbi Abraham Gopin, who was attacked by a man wielding \"a huge brick\" while Gopin walked in a park. Gopin was \"hospitalized with 'a broken nose, missing teeth, stitches on his head and lacerations on his body.'\" It's unclear why, since that perpetrator was arrested and named in New York's (limited) online court records.\n\nBrooklyn's streets clearly aren't safe. Who's responsible? Felder pointed to Mayor Bill de Blasio's \"getting rid of the broken windows policy, and any time crime goes up in general, hate crimes go up.\" For his part, Americans Against Antisemitism founder Dov Hikind cited now former Gov. Andrew Cuomo's embrace of bail reform, which created a 24-hour revolving door for arrestees.\n\nThen there's the district attorney. Some cases probably weren't prosecuted because victims opted not to bother. Hikind has a different take, though: \"I think people would be willing to pursue if they were encouraged by the DA, but I don't think the DA is interested in pursuing these cases.\"\n\nThere's clearly a gap between arrests and prosecutions. Reflecting on that, Brooke Goldstein, founder and executive director of The Lawfare Project , emailed: \"What we are seeing is a systemic problem within our justice system that fails to recognize the severity of antisemitic hate crimes as compared to hate crimes against other minority groups. ... Crimes committed against Jews are often ignored or put aside due to a fundamental misunderstanding of what Jew hatred looks like today.\"\n\nAny such misunderstanding could be remedied by communal engagement. However, Felder observed, \"In general, the DA's office in Brooklyn does not have a relationship with the Jewish community at all, and I don't think they care much about the Jewish community.\"\n\nAs proof, Felder, who represents Borough Park and Midwood, observed, \"'How many times has the DA's office been in touch with [my] office over the years?' The answer is zero. That's not good-not because I need his attention, but I represent a district that has the largest concentration of Holocaust survivors outside of Israel, so hate crimes take on a bigger significance.\"\n\nFelder added, \"Iam not by any means, G-d forbid, accusing him of being antisemitic in any way. ... [But] when hate crimes have occurred ... in this district, the Brooklyn DA has not been present ... whereas other times, when things happen in the city he makes sure to be around. ... the Brooklyn DA's office doesn't believe the Jewish community is a priority of any sort.\"\n\nIt's time for change. The next mayor should prioritize public safety and fully fund the police. New York's new governor should work to reform bail reform. The state legislature should pass legislation modernizing the courts; it's absurd that the public can't readily access public information about court proceedings. In general, it shouldn't be so hard for the public to access information about what's happened with reported crimes that directly affect members of the public. And Brooklyn's district attorney should consistently prioritize antisemitic hate crime prosecutions, as he recently did with two related May 2021 incidents. Because Brooklyn's Jews, like all other New Yorkers, deserve to live in safety.\n\nMelissa Langsam Braunstein is an independent writer and communications strategist in Washington, D.C.

The 2020 case was heard by U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan in Brooklyn.\n\nFurther details are left out as well. The two BLM rioters threw the Molotov cocktail into an empty police car in New York City, and cut a deal with prosecutors to plead guilty in exchange for reduced charges. The defendants were charged with conspiracy to commit arson and possess an explosive device, with a maximum possible sentencing of five years. As a part of the deal, the defendants paid the city of New York $30,137 each and the prosecutors recommended a sentence of 18 to 24 months.\n\nThe January 6 rioter, Thomas Webster, swung a metal flagpole at a police officer, tackled the officer, and choked him while he attempted to remove the officer's gas mask and helmet. Webster did not plead guilty, instead arguing that he acted in self-defense. The jury did not find his argument convincing and found Webster guilty of five felonies : assaulting, resisting, or impeding officers with a dangerous weapon; obstructing officers during a civil disorder; entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds, while carrying a dangerous weapon; engaging in disorderly or disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds, while carrying a dangerous weapon, and engaging in physical violence in a restricted building or grounds, while carrying a dangerous weapon.\n\nWebster was also found guilty of the misdemeanor of engaging in an act of physical violence in the Capitol building or grounds. In addition to 10 years in prison, Webster received three years of supervised release post-release and a fine of $2,060.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com .

      "text": "How Universities Can Take Back the Quad\n\nThey have student codes of conduct, they just need to enforce them.\n\nMore than 100 people staging a pro-Palestinian protest were arrested last week at Columbia University after the university president asked the NYPD to intervene. That didn't quell the situation: A new tent camp was soon set up on the campus quad, and disorder has continued , with some protesters screaming, \"We know where you live now\" and throwing liquids at Jewish students. \"Other pro-Palestinian protesters circling around the main gates claimed to be with Hamas,\" reported a Jewish student. \"One said 'I am Hamas' on video.\" The university has moved to a hybrid class model to allow students to attend online for the rest of the semester, which ends next week. As of Wednesday, the university was working with student protesters to dismantle some of the tents in the encampment and ensure they would adhere to safety and behavioral guidelines.\n\nThe protests at Columbia are a product of the explosion of antisemitism on college campuses around the country since October 7 but have also inspired further demonstrations: Students have been arrested at New York University , Yale , and the University of Minnesota among others, and tent encampments are popping up on campuses across the country . Colleges and universities have a tool at hand to deal with this problem, if only they'll use it: enforcing codes of conduct by clarifying expectations and holding perpetrators accountable.\n\nColumbia President Minouche Shafik and other university officials testified before the House Education and Workforce Committee on April 17, claiming they were doing their best to maintain order. Yet the very next day, the situation became so chaotic that Shafik announced the suspension of the student protesters and asked the NYPD to clear the encampment.\n\nColumbia has had a mixed record in addressing extreme anti-Israel incidents. On November 10, Columbia suspended its Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) chapter after it engaged in an unauthorized walkout despite university warnings against such action. But then Columbia allowed a new group to take SJP's place. That new organization hosted an event in March featuring speakers from what Israel calls a front group for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), a U.S. government- designated terrorist group. Shafik denounced the event, hired an investigative firm to gather information, and suspended four students.\n\nThe congressional hearing clarified that radical teachers are part of the problem. Columbia administrators claimed to have removed professor Joseph Massad from a chair position over his praise of October 7 as \" awesome \" and other abhorrent remarks, but Columbia's website still listed Massad as chair as of the April 15 hearing. And Shafik said she had fired Mohamed Abdou, who was hired after posting on social media: \"I'm with Hamas & Hezbollah & Islamic Jihad.\" Abdou remained on Columbia's website as of April 17 and was reportedly present at the unsanctioned protest on campus during the hearing. Numerous Columbia faculty members aided protesters during demonstrations on Monday, holding signs that read \"End Student Suspensions Now\" and \"Restore Faculty Governance.\"\n\nElsewhere, protesters hijacked an annual awards ceremony at the University of Michigan on March 26. The protesters, in clear violation of university policy, shouted down and silenced their own university president, Santa Ono, cutting short an event intended to honor the academic achievements of undergraduates.\n\nHas the university disciplined the disruptors? Unclear.\n\nThankfully, some outside of academia are trying to help. The House Education and Workforce Committee, which also called the presidents of  Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania, and MIT to testify on their handling of campus antisemitism late last year, has initiated numerous inquiries . For its part, the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights has opened dozens of investigations of American colleges and universities for alleged violations of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , which \"prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin for programs that receive federal funds.\" A 2019 executive order clarified that antisemitic discrimination can fall under this rubric.\n\nYet too many administrators have failed to adequately clarify and enforce their own codes of conduct during the six months since the Israel-Hamas war began with Hamas' invasion of Israel.\n\nThe University of California-Berkeley has been a hot spot since the days following Hamas' brutal attack. On October 16 protesters blocked the central section of Berkeley's landmark Sather Gate. Finally, more than five months later, the university chancellor announced she would post observers after protesters had blocked the entrance with yellow tape for weeks. When the university finally removed the tape, protesters replaced it with a massive banner, mocking university authorities and continuing to block the gate.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the protesters didn't stop there. On February 26, Jewish students were forced to evacuate an event when violent demonstrators broke through doors to prevent an Israeli lawyer from speaking. A mob gathered outside smashed windows and assaulted Jewish students. A Jewish student declared three days later at a congressional hearing, \"It's not safe to be a Jewish student at UC-Berkeley.\"\n\nJust two weeks ago, Berkeley law students turned Dean Erwin Chemerinsky's dinner for students at his home into a protest. Prior to the event, radical students published a poster featuring a caricature of Chemerinsky holding a bloody fork and knife, which, said Chemerinsky, \" invokes the antisemitic trope of blood libel.\" Later, a law student hijacked the dinner to make a speech condemning Israel.\n\nOn the East Coast, American University has been targeted. On October 19, multiple Jewish students discovered swastikas graffitied on their dorm room doors. In November, a pro-Israel, Jewish student's piano recital poster was defaced with a swastika and the words \"DEATH TO THE ZIONISTS HITLER WAS RIGHT.\" And a protest organized by SJP inside a class building on November 9 clearly violated the school's code of conduct by intentionally interfering with students' right to study.\n\nOn January 25, about a week after a nonprofit filed a federal complaint against the university for a campus climate hostile to Jewish students, American's president released a new policy effective for the spring semester that included a ban on indoor protests. Daring the university to enforce its new guidelines, SJP conducted an indoor protest on February 8. The university responded on April 8, putting SJP on probation .\n\nSome administrators are imposing more serious consequences. On April 5, Vanderbilt University announced the expulsion of three students, the suspension of another, and disciplinary probations for 22 other students who had protested Vanderbilt's refusal to divest from Israel by conducting an overnight sit-in that began with a broken window and an assault on a security officer.\n\nAlso on April 5, at Pomona College in California, police arrested 20 anti-Israel protesters who stormed the college president's office and refused to identify themselves.\n\nA university's code of conduct serves a foundational role in cultivating an ethical campus community and healthy learning environment. Such codes function as a collegiate \"rule of law,\" governing a democratic microcosm and transitional training ground for adult citizenship in a diverse democracy.\n\nUnfortunately, too many students are either unaware of their university's code of conduct, or they don't mind violating it. Administrators can nip this problem in the bud by including questions about freedom of speech, peaceful protest, and respect for the dignity of others in the application process. And when students accept an offer of admission, leaders should then systematically teach students what the university expects of them during the orientation process, requiring admitted students to certify that they have read the code of conduct and commit to abide by it. School pronouncements about fighting antisemitism and publications of disruptive activity policies are helpful. But clear expectations must be supported by visible, swift, and consistent corrective actions.\n\nAnd for students who don't take these expectations seriously, there is no substitute for consequences.\n\nDavid May is a research manager and senior research analyst at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\n\nAntonette Bowman is a research fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies\n\nYour membership includes the ability to share articles\n                with friends.

      "text": "Columbia Roiled By Antisemitism\n\nAn anti-Israel encampment has sparked copycats at elite universities across the country.\n\nHappy Tuesday! There unfortunately won't be a new episode of Dispatch Live tonight, but our weekly live-streamed conversation will return next Tuesday at 8 p.m. ET!\n\nOn the eve of Passover, Rabbi Elie Buechler, the director of the Orthodox Union-Jewish Learning Initiative at Columbia University, shared a warning with hundreds of Jewish students at the elite university in New York City. \"The events of the last few days, especially last night, have made it clear that Columbia University's Public Safety and the NYPD cannot guarantee Jewish students' safety in the face of extreme antisemitism and anarchy,\" he wrote in a WhatsApp message. \"I would strongly recommend you return home as soon as possible and remain home until the reality in and around campus has dramatically improved.\"\n\nThe \"reality in and around\" Columbia's campus is bleak: An almost week-long encampment of anti-Israel and pro-Palestianian protesters on the main lawn has become a national flashpoint, drawing condemnation from leaders at all levels of government and spawning copycat encampments at elite colleges across the country. Columbia's administration has failed to protect Jewish students from the antisemitic harassment and intimidation emanating from the tent camp and protesters surrounding the campus, once again calling into question the ability and willingness of university administrations to safeguard some of their own students.\n\nEarly Wednesday morning, hundreds of students began a protest and erected a tent city-which organizers dubbed the \"Gaza Solidarity Encampment\"-occupying a lawn in the middle of the school's campus. The start of the encampment intentionally coincided with Columbia President Minouche Shafik's testimony before Congress about the rise in antisemitism on her campus. She told lawmakers that the university doesn't \"tolerate antisemitic threats, images, and other violations.\"\n\nThe next day, Shafik requested that the New York City Police Department (NYPD) intervene on her campus. \"The actions of these individuals are in violation of university rules and policies, including that they have interfered with the operation of the university, refused to identify themselves, refused to disperse, set up tents on campus space, failed to comply with policies, and damaged campus property,\" she wrote in a letter to the NYPD. \"The continued encampment raises safety concerns for the individuals involved and the entire community.\"\n\nNYPD officers cleared the encampment later on Thursday, arresting 108 students-including Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar's daughter -in the process. But the protesters quickly regrouped and set up a new encampment on the other side of the lawn that has continued uninterrupted. The organizers' demands include that Columbia end its dual degree program with Tel Aviv University and sever ties with any other Israeli academic institutions. They also demand the university publish a statement calling for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and \"[denounce] the ongoing genocidal campaign against the Palestinian people.\"\n\nFollowing the encampment arrests, some Columbia faculty and staff staged a walkout in support of the protesters. Barnard College President Laura Ann Rosenbury said in a letter on Monday that students suspended for participating in the encampment could have their suspension lifted \"if they agree to follow all Barnard rules during a probationary period.\"\n\nSince Hamas' October 7 attacks-in which terrorists murdered an estimated 1,200 men, women, and children in Israel-Jewish Americans have had to contend with a wave of antisemitism sweeping across the country. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) tracked nearly 8,900 antisemitic incidents in 2023, a 140 percent increase over 2022 and the highest annual number in the more than 40 years ADL has recorded incidents. College campuses have been a focal point for many of those incidents . Elite universities' lackluster responses to antisemitism already toppled Harvard University President Claudine Gay and University of Pennsylvania President Liz Magill, and Shafik now faces calls to resign from more than a dozen lawmakers.\n\nThere's no denying the antisemitism that has exploded on and around Columbia's campus in recent days. Jewish students were harassed on the streets directly outside the campus early Friday by masked individuals yelling , \"The 7th of October is going to be every day for you.\" Other protesters outside the campus shouted chants in support of Hamas, including, \"We say justice, you say how? Burn Tel Aviv to the ground,\" and \"Hamas, we love you. We support your rockets, too.\" Others shouted references to Hamas' military wing: \"Al-Qassam, make us proud, kill another soldier now.\"\n\nOne member of a group of Jewish students waving Israeli flags and singing songs by Jewish pop singer Matisyahu was assaulted and chased off campus on Saturday night after attempting to retrieve a flag stolen by a protester. Protesters told the student to \"go back to Poland,\" and one masked individual stood before a group of people waving Israeli flags with a sign suggesting they were \"Al-Qassam's next targets.\"\n\nThe activists have repeatedly cited their First Amendment rights as criticism of their tactics has grown, and they of course have a right to protest-but not a right to break university rules and occupy regulated spaces. Plus, free speech and assembly rights do not protect targeted harassment. \"True threats and incitement to violence, as defined by the Supreme Court, are not protected,\" the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression noted in a statement on Monday. \"Neither is discriminatory harassment: targeted conduct that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it denies the targeted student access to an educational opportunity or benefit. And when protesters surround opposing speakers or otherwise prevent students from freely moving around campus, they cross the line separating protected expression and unprotected misconduct.\"\n\nIt's always challenging to assign responsibility for harassment and intimidation to individuals in the chaos of protests, but even more so in a sea of masked protesters on a college campus in the middle of New York City. As Yoni Kurtz-a history student at Columbia and president of the Columbia/Barnard College Hillel Student Executive board- explained , there has been a divide between Pro-Palestinian student protesters on campus, who may shout antisemitic slogans and express support for Hamas but have largely refrained from violence themselves, and New York City residents who show up at campus entrances. \"Last night, the people outside campus were even more unhinged than usual, and it seems that some even snuck on to campus,\" he suggested based on his own experience on Saturday night. \"[People] have for a long time pretended that students on campus protesting are the exact same level of dangerous and crazy as the people on the streets. ... This is definitely not true.\"\n\nStill, that distinction has somewhat collapsed over the last few days. \"It is a sad failure of all student protesters for Palestine, from the leaders to those who only joined in the last few days, not to disavow this violence,\" Kurtz said. On Sunday night, protesters at the encampment surrounded Jewish students to physically intimidate the students into leaving, saying,\"We have Zionists who have entered the camp.\"\n\nState, local, and federal officials from both parties have condemned the developments. New York City Mayor Eric Adams said he was \"horrified and disgusted with the antisemitism being spewed at and around the Columbia University campus.\" New York's congressional delegation -several members of which visited Columbia yesterday-denounced the targeting of Jewish students. \"Over the past several days, the rhetoric has escalated to a point where Jewish students feel unsafe, insecure and broadly harassed, to the point where the president had to cancel classes today and make them virtual,\" said Democratic Rep. Daniel Goldman. \"That is unacceptable for a university. That is unacceptable for an academic institution.\"\n\nGoldman's Democratic colleague, Rep. Jared Moskowitz of Florida, called on the Department of Education to take action against the school for failing to protect students. \"Not enough is being done,\" he said . \"If this was any other group on campus, this would not be happening.\"\n\nGOP House Education and Workforce Chair Virginia Foxx sent a letter to Columbia on Sunday threatening consequences if the university does not act. \"Columbia's continued failure to restore order and safety promptly to campus constitutes a major breach of the University's Title VI obligations, upon which federal financial assistance is contingent, and which must immediately be rectified,\" she wrote. \"If you do not rectify this danger, then the committee will not hesitate in holding you accountable.\" Columbia, along with Cornell and Penn, are already being investigated by the Education Department over alleged antisemitic and Islamophobic incidents.\n\nThe White House chimed in on Sunday with a statement condemning the antisemitism at the weekend's demonstrations. \"While every American has the right to peaceful protest, calls for violence and physical intimidation targeting Jewish students and the Jewish community are blatantly antisemitic, unconscionable, and dangerous-they have absolutely no place on any college campus, or anywhere in the United States of America,\" White House spokesman Andrew Bates said on Sunday . Unlike previous statements on antisemitism on campus, the White House didn't include a side-by-side condemnation of Islamophobia. But President Joe Biden added one back in on Monday. \"I condemn the antisemitic protests,\" told reporters yesterday. \"I also condemn those who don't understand what's going on with the Palestinians.\"\n\nMayor Adams has called on the university to increase cooperation with the NYPD to ensure students' safety. NYPD officials have said that because the school is a private institution on private property, law enforcement can only have a presence on campus at the request of the school-as was the case with the Thursday encampment clearing-or unless crimes have been committed or are imminent. \"Absent some ongoing crime, we cannot just go onto Columbia campus as we see fit,\" NYPD Deputy Commissioner Michael Gerber said yesterday . \"As a general matter, Columbia University, and this goes back many years, does not want NYPD present on campus, that is their decision.\" The NYPD has, however, maintained a significant presence on streets surrounding the campus.\n\nColumbia announced an increase in campus security guard patrols on Monday, and Shafik said in a statement yesterday the administration would create a \"working group\" of administration officials and faculty to \"bring this crisis to a resolution.\" She acknowledged the calls for police to be present on campus, but emphasized that \"we should be able to do this ourselves.\" Shafik also canceled in-person classes on Monday \"to deescalate the rancor and give us all a chance to consider next steps,\" and the university announced last night that courses will be hybrid (both in-person and virtual) through the end of the semester.\n\nBut some Jewish organizations are not waiting for the administration to keep students safe. The university's Chabad chapter, for example, said it hired additional armed guards to protect Jewish students as they attend Passover meals this week. The Kraft Center for Jewish Student Life said on Sunday that the center would remain open as a safe haven . But Robert Kraft-the billionaire New England Patriots owner and Columbia donor for whom the center is named-is severing ties with the university. \"I am no longer confident that Columbia can protect its students and staff,\" he said in a statement Monday. \"And I am not comfortable supporting the university until corrective action is taken.\"\n\nThe unrest in recent days hasn't been limited to Columbia. Protests and encampments in solidarity with the Columbia protesters have emerged on at least a dozen other campuses, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). MIT President Sally Kornbluth is the only one of the three university presidents who testified at a congressional hearing on antisemitism in December and still holds her job. Authorities arrested 60 protesters at Yale University-47 of whom were students-on Monday, and the NYPD broke up a protest occupying a portion of New York University's campus last night, making \"numerous arrests.\"\n\nSome Jewish students at Columbia feel unsupported by the school. \"Where were you when the Jewish students were being harassed?\" David Jonah Lederer, one of the students waving Israeli flags on Saturday night, said last night when asked about the faculty and staff walkout protesting the encampment arrests. \"Why are they not walking out for us?\"\n\nNew York Times : Papua New Guinea Leader Criticizes Biden's 'Cannibals' Comment\n\nTwice last week, Mr. Biden suggested without evidence that his uncle had been eaten by cannibals.\n\n\"He got shot down in New Guinea, and they never found the body because there used to be - there were a lot of cannibals, for real, in that part of New Guinea,\" Mr. Biden said of his uncle during an address on steel and aluminum tariffs in Pittsburgh on Wednesday.\n\n...\n\nMr. Biden's description of his uncle's death does not match military records. Ambrose Finnegan, a brother of Mr. Biden's mother, was a passenger in an aircraft that \"for unknown reasons\" had to ditch in the Pacific Ocean off the northern coast of New Guinea on May 14, 1944, according to the Pentagon's Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency .

The man was clad in a hoodie, with a black backpack on his shoulders.\n\nThe alleged suspect in the case did have a mask on in footage of the alleged murder.\n\nSeveral news reports have indicated that the suspected shooter stayed a hostel on New York's Upper West Side, and checked in with a fake identification card.\n\nThe same ID, which claimed he was from New Jersey, was used to check into the hostel on Nov. 30, per CNN.\n\nMultiple law enforcement officials also told the outlet that the suspect took a greyhound bus from Atlanta to New York prior to the shooting.\n\nThe officials said they believe the suspect arrived in New York on Nov. 24, which is 10 days before the shooting took place.

The department has searched the New York park for the suspect's missing gray backpack that he wore during the shooting, but were not able to locate it.\n\nA police official said they conducted a grid search of the park, and looked through garbage cans, dumpsters, and bushes to no avail. NYPD was later able to spot the man leaving the park on security footage, and did not have the backpack.\n\nPolice officials did not indicate what would be in the backpack, but have not been able to track down the murder weapon.\n\nThe NYPD encouraged people with any information on the shooting to call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477).

The agency says free bus rides cost $300 million last year, which adds to the MTA's worsening financial picture. MTA bus drivers are not allowed to enforce the fare due to concerns about their safety, the agency says.\n\nA state commission that looked at the issue found the MTA lost $500 million to fare evaders in 2021 and another $690 million last year, a 38% increase. Fare evaders on buses accounted for $315 million, while $285 million was lost on the subway system, according to the panel.\n\nThe transit agency faces a potential $2.6 billion budget deficit in 2025 and is seeking more state funding to help reduce its projected shortfalls.\n\nFares and tolls account for a significant proportion of the MTA's annual budget revenue, or roughly $7 billion a year. The agency says every dollar lost to evasion \"impairs the MTA's financial stability, threatens reliable transit for all New Yorkers, and increases the need for alternative revenue sources, including through larger fare and toll hikes.\"\n\n\"Fare and toll evasion is a sensitive issue that raises difficult questions about social cohesion, inequality, and appropriate use of enforcement,\" the MTA said in a recent statement. \"But the situation in New York has reached a crisis level, and avoiding the topic is no longer a viable option.\"\n\nThe Citizens Budget Commission, a fiscal watchdog group, has compared the financial losses in 2023 from fare evaders to the amount of funding \"that would be raised through two rounds of fare hikes.\" The group has called on state and local authorities to do more to crack down on evaders.\n\n\"Simply put, sufficient fare revenue is essential to operate and maintain the high-quality, reliable, and affordable transit systems New Yorkers and the region rely on,\" the commission said in a recent report. \"More effective fare compliance is important to ensure adequate revenues. The alternative - charging paying riders and drivers more - would be unfair.\""

It failed [Diller's son] Ryan ... and it failed every New Yorker who valued public safety.\n\n\"That is why we're fighting every single day - not just for our men and women at this department, but for the people of New York City - to fix what is broken,\" she said. \"We often talk about it in abstract terms ... but this is real. Continuing down the current path that New York State is on is devastating and [has] deadly consequences.\n\n\"We owe it to Jonathan, his family and every cop who puts on that uniform to right those wrongs and to protect the brave people who do this incredibly dangerous work.\"\n\nDiller was walking up to the passenger side of a gray Kia Soul illegally parked outside a cell-phone store when Guy Rivera allegedly rattled off three rounds from inside the vehicle, shattering the silence of the quiet street in Far Rockaway that day. Cops have said they believe Rivera and a cohort were planning to rob the store.\n\nIn footage of the horrific incident shared by the Instagram account @ny_scoop , Diller appeared to drag himself behind the car as he collapsed on the pavement - and his partner fired two shots of his own, one of which hit Rivera in the back.\n\nDiller's partner also yanked a man later identified as Lindy Jones from the driver's seat and yelled at him to \"get on the f-ing floor\" before putting him in handcuffs.\n\nA swarm of cops descended on Diller as he moaned because of the pain of the gut shot, which struck just below his bulletproof vest.\n\nSeveral officers carefully loaded Diller into an unmarked police vehicle. They rushed him to Jamaica Hospital, but he didn't make it.\n\nRivera - an ex-con with a lengthy rap sheet that featured 21 prior arrests - was indicted on charges of first-and second-degree murder, attempted murder and a flock of weapons charges.\n\n\"We have a real recidivist problem,\" Mayor Eric Adams said at a press conference right after the murder. \"These two individuals, one of the men had been arrested on a gun charge in April of 2023, the driver, he has more than 20 priors. The other has an equal amount of priors.\"\n\nCritics of the state's bail-reform laws have claimed they are too lenient and lead to a revolving door for criminals.\n\nRivera is scheduled to appear in court April 3.\n\nStephanie Diller - who held the couple's rambunctious young son Ryan in her lap throughout Monday's service - spoke through tears about her fallen husband.\n\n\"One year ago, we lost our Jonathan in the most tragic way imaginable. It was hard to accept mentally the fact that he died but also the way that he died,\" she said.\n\n\"It was like he was ripped from this world and from us. We were angry, heartbroken, confused and had no idea how we could possibly go on.\n\n\"But through Jonathan, we somehow found the strength to continue forward and are trying our hardest to celebrate his life instead of mourning. And this is what I want to do here today. I want to use the time to celebrate the man Jonathan was and the impact he had on those who knew him.\"\n\nShe recalled how Diller was a courageous, generous jokester who wove his strength together with tenderness.\n\nKaz Daughtry, deputy mayor of New York City's Public Safety Department, remembered the same - including Diller's penchant for pranks.\n\n\"We talk about the funny things Jonathan said because Jonathan was an extremely funny, funny, funny officer,\" Daughtry said.\n\n\"He made everyone laugh, and he lit up the room when he walked in,\" he continued. \"He was prankster ... and we all just sit there and laugh, and that's how we cope with it.\n\n\"Then you lay home at night, and you think about this day, and sometimes tears come down in your eyes. But those are happy tears to show that we will never forget Jonathan.\"\n\nStephanie also remembered her husband as an amazing dad and said he set a great example for Ryan even though they were only together for a year.\n\n\"I don't want him to be just a memory,\" she said. \"I want us to talk about him, remember him, I want my son to grow up knowing who his dad was through the stories people shared with him.\"\n\nBut more than anything, she said, she remembers how much he loved her - and how often he said it.\n\n\"When I miss him, I search the phrase, 'I love you' on my phone - and a million old texts from him popped up,\" she said. \"He never missed an opportunity to tell you, whether it was texts or little notes on the coffee machine.\n\n\"The years we spent together felt like a lifetime in love that I will never forget,\" the heartbroken widow said. \"To my Jonathan: I love you forever. I miss you every second of every day. There is a big piece of me missing that nothing will ever fill.\n\n\"I hope I make you proud and continue to make you proud, and I can't wait to see your smiling face again someday.\"\n\nAdvertisement"

Just want to smash it quick.\n\n\"I like the way she's doing that, the way she's sliding up the pole,\" he adds.\n\nMercado, a $144,000-a-year grade 3 detective assigned to Bronx special victims, joined the force in 2018, records show.\n\nShe is not named in the raunchy video - which has been making the rounds among the rank and file - but law enforcement sources confirmed to The Post that it is her.\n\nSome on the force said it's Mercado's business, not the NYPD's.\n\n\"What she's doing really has nothing to do with her as an employee, as an NYC detective,\" a police union source said.\n\n\"She's not wearing NYPD paraphernalia. Nothing in the video says she's a detective.\n\n\"If she is performing for money, if she has a side gig, the job would want to know about that,\" the source said.\n\n\"The member would be obligated to file an off-duty employment application. I would say nothing she does in the video is the department's business.\"\n\nAnother police source defended the scantily clad cop, saying she has \"made some good collars\" and is \"respected by her peers.\"\n\nRetired NYPD Special Victims Division Chief Michael Osgood also questioned Mercado's after-hours twerking gig.\n\n\"There's a line of thinking that what you do off duty, you do off duty,\" Osgood said.\n\n\"But I think this conduct is unbecoming a police officer. I find it wrong morally if you're a special victims detective.\"\n\nIt's unclear what, if any, department discipline Mercado could face over the sultry performance, but her moonlighting gig isn't the first time an NYPD cop was caught in a compromising position.\n\nOne rookie cop took heat in 2023 when she was caught dancing on the job with a turnstile jumper at an Upper West Side subway station - with her moves posted on three TikTok videos.\n\nIt's unclear if she faced disciplinary action .\n\nIn 2022, then-rookie Bronx cop Vera Mekuli was caught on video giving a married lieutenant a lap dance during a rowdy police party - and was transferred to the transit bureau.\n\nShe later laughed at her escapades by posing with a copy of The Post story about her newfound fame.\n\nTwo female cops were demoted in 2018 after posing with a nearly nude male stripper while in uniform at a Mother's Day event, while two others faced disciplinary action at their precinct.\n\nMercado has not responded to requests for comment from The Post.\n\nS-Quire declined to comment on Thursday.\n\nThe NYPD did not immediately respond.\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "NYPD's DNA file saves teens' lives - but know-nothing Council wants it shut down\n\nNew York City kids are in trouble.\n\nLast year, youths were victimized at the highest levels since NYPD started officially collating their stats - including record numbers of kids who suffered rape, robbery, felony and misdemeanor assaults, and grand and petit larcenies.\n\nOverall, we've seen a heartbreaking 71% increase in NYC minors victimized by major crimes in the past half-decade.\n\nThis doesn't happen in a vacuum. NYC kids are hurt largely because they are sucked into a vortex of teens who behave badly - and who pressure or scare each other into behaving worse.\n\nIndeed, last year was also record-setting for juvenile arrests for robbery, felony and misdemeanor assault, grand and petit larceny.\n\nGun arrests were up by a third in the past half-decade, while narcotics arrests rose a disastrous 81% since 2021.\n\nNow the New York City Council, in its infinite non -wisdom, is looking to drag kids even further from the one skill that will help them avoid this maelstrom of criminality: behaving well.\n\nWith its renewed push to keep cops from collecting DNA samples from minors, the council would remove yet another deterrent to violence and delinquency from this vulnerable population.\n\nThe bill, now in committee and sponsored by progressive council members too dim to recognize the relationship between bad criminal justice policies and rising youth crime, would require the consent of parents, legal guardians, or attorney for pre-arrest DNA sampling of minors.\n\nNYPD officials last month told councilmembers just how limited - and how critical - the current DNA collection regime is.\n\nOfficers only take \"abandonment samples\" from teens in relation to felony cases - and for kids under age 13, only for the most serious felonies. The only exceptions are for sex and hate crimes and gun cases.\n\nSubscribe to our daily Post Opinion newsletter!\n\nPlease provide a valid email address.\n\nBy clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy .\n\nNever miss a story.\n\nIndeed, data shows that minors' DNA is only being taken in conjunction with horrifying incidents, with three out of four related to gun arrests.\n\nThis is critical to public safety: Last year saw 500 youth gun arrestees - or 12% of the city's total firearms arrests.\n\nThe sampling has played a crucial role in solving crimes by establishing guilt, as well as in proving innocence.\n\nFurther, despite NYC's enormous boom in juvenile crime, police are still collecting a minuscule number of DNA samples from minors: just 174 abandonment samples in 2024 and only seven consent samples.\n\nAt a recent hearing on the policy, councilmembers like Althea Stevens bemoaned it as a barrier to \"rebuild[ing] trust in black and brown communities.\"\n\nBut she and other activists miss the equally critical need for youths to avoid criminality - and that is something DNA databases have a remarkably high ability to help.\n\nCriminologist Jennifer Doleac has revealed the fantastic deterrent impact these databases have on individuals who got sucked into criminality.\n\nDoleac's 2020 analysis for the Manhattan Institute found that adding people convicted of a violent felony offense to a DNA database reduced the likelihood of another conviction within five years by an astounding 17%.\n\nIn another experiment, she found convicted felons added to a DNA database had an incredible 42% lower likelihood of a new conviction in the first year - and this improvement lasted for at least three years.\n\nBut most relevant for NYC's crime-riddled youth: Doleac found these deterrent effects were strongest among the youngest offenders in her samples (those aged 18 to 23).\n\nShe also saw larger effects for first-time offenders than for recidivist criminals. \"Adding people to the DNA database sooner, before they go too far down a criminal path, is more effective at changing their behavior,\" she noted.\n\nThis is exactly what at-risk NYC teens need .\n\nAmazingly, Doleac's data showed that the positive shifts in behavior went beyond just avoiding crime.\n\nFor younger offenders, it seems to nudge them toward enrollment in educational and training programs, and from unemployment to gainful work.\n\nApparently, the knowledge that they may be held accountable for bad behavior pushes juveniles away from peers who will get them into trouble - and helps them thrive.\n\nThe City Council's \"progressives\" ignore the evidenced reality that where NYPD officers have taken a step back, youths behave more self-destructively.\n\nFollowing the pandemic, the NYPD no longer polices truancy. No wonder almost 35% of NYC's public school students were chronically absent last school year, up from 25% before COVID-19 hit.\n\nNot to mention that stop-and-frisk encounters, which deterred young New Yorkers from walking around with guns, were over 2,600% higher a decade-and-a-half ago - before juveniles became a larger portion of the city's shooters.\n\nNew York's kids deserve to have grown-ups in their lives who will push them toward better behavior.\n\nPolice are critical in ensuring those societal guardrails - and collecting limited DNA from minors at grave risk of a criminal future should be a no-brainer part of that role.\n\nHannah E. Meyers is a policing and public safety policy expert and former NYPD senior counterterrorism analyst."

Eric Dym sold his home and set off with his family on what they planned as a dream adventure - backpacking through Asia to learn jiu jitsu, study Buddhism and enjoy the outdoors.\n\nInstead, Dym and his wife Luiza found themselves in a living nightmare when their son Derek, at age 7, was diagnosed with a rare, aggressive brain cancer.\n\nFor the past year, the financially-strapped couple and their two kids have been living in an RV camped near Los Angeles Children's Hospital, where Derek has undergone grueling tests and treatment.\n\n\"We have no idea how this happened - he's a healthy kid one day, and his life changed in a second,\" said Dym, 45, an ex-Marine and co-host of a podcast on policing .\n\n\"We're not giving up. We refuse. We have to stand up and fight against cancer.\"\n\nThe family was in Bali when Derek began to suffer headaches. At first, a local clinic brushed it off as nothing serious. Sensing something wrong, the Dyms brought their son to the hospital where a CT scan confirmed a mass.\n\nThe couple, who also have a 3-year-old daughter, Ellie, left all their belongings behind and headed to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. But they stopped in LA, the first US city, to rush Derek to an emergency room. After the family spent a month in a hotel, then three months as guests of the Ronald McDonald House, Dym bought the RV, and a truck to pull it, to make their home.\n\nThe Dyms have cashed out their 401Ks and maxed out their credit cards to make sure Derek gets anything he needs in a desperate bid to save his life.\n\nHis inoperable tumor, located beneath a vital area of the brain, hardly budged with radiation and oral chemotherapy.\n\nAfter a clinical trial rejected Derek because the mass had grown, the Dyms paid $5,000 for a 30-day supply of medication they hoped would slow its progression. Insurance finally covered another drug costing $40,000 a month: \"It was a struggle to get approved,\" Dym said.\n\nDym gets an NYPD pension and city health insurance, but $50,000 in co-pays and out-of-network medical costs piled up. \"We have to start from scratch all over again,\" he said of finding the funds for future expenses.\n\nThe anguished mom and dad dove into research of DMG Glioma, a frequently fatal cancer which strikes about 300 children a year in the US. They consulted doctors in every major children's hospital, and read every study - all with a frustrating lack of answers.\n\n\"They don't have a cure, and they don't know how it forms. They can't tell us how he got it,\" Eric said.\n\n\"I want to know why this is happening to my son, and how to fix it,\" Luiza added. \"It's MRI after MRI, prayer after prayer.\"\n\nHoping alternative treatments might help, she bought a $4,000 red-light therapy helmet and a $10,000 sound-therapy machine, but their impact on the tumor is unknown.\n\nWith a shunt in his brain to drain fluid, Derek was able to play with other kids and live happily for five months. He enjoyed Minecraft, a video game he received on a toy shopping spree from the Make-a-Wish Foundation.\n\nBut recently his condition has worsened. Today, the 8-year-old can barely walk, and his right arm is immobile. Fatigued, he sleeps most of the day. Little sister Ellie holds his hand and helps feed him.\n\nYet Derek faces his ordeal with amazing courage and a thumbs-up, his dad said: \"This kid's my hero. He's brave. He never complains - and that gives me strength.\"\n\nAs word of Derek's plight spread on social media, the Dyms have been overwhelmed by support, and grateful for a flood of donations meant to ease their financial burden.\n\nA  GoFundMe page launched by friends this week has raised more than $154,000 to date.\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "NYPD commish Jessica Tisch vows to bring back 1.5-mile timed run, reduces college requirements to beef up force in 'crisis'\n\nThe NYPD is launching a three-pronged effort to beef up the dwindling ranks of New York's Finest, including reinstating a timed-run requirement and a reduced college credit condition.\n\nPolice Commissioner Jessica Tisch said Wednesday that the changes are required to hire more cops as the department's ranks have plunged dangerously in recent years - including among vital sergeants .\n\n\"We need more cops, and I'm not going to sugarcoat it,\" Tisch said at an Association for a Better New York event.\n\n\"The NYPD is in a hiring crisis and this is not a budget problem. Mayor [Eric] Adams has given us all the resources we needed to bring in every class we wanted to bring in, but the applicants just aren't there,\" she said.\n\n\"It wasn't that long ago that people would wait years to get called to join the academy,\" Tisch said. \"Now we are practically begging people to take the exam, and when they pass, we are scrambling to get them hired as quickly as possible. So, what happened?\"\n\nThe changes call for the department to reduce the minimum number of college credits required to enter the police academy to 24 instead of the current 60.\n\nPolice brass said the department, one of the last major police forces in the country to have college credit requirements, was forced to disqualify 29%, or 2,275 applicants, in 2023 alone due to the standard.\n\nThe new rules will also give police recruits more credits for completing the six-month academy training regimen based on a recent assessment by the National College Credit Recommendations Service that determined that completing the rigorous training is equivalent to 45 credits, up from the current 36.\n\nFinally, Tisch said a longstanding timed-run requirement that was axed in 2023 by controversial then-Chief of Training Juanita Holmes will be reinstated.\n\nIt requires cops and recruits to complete a 1.5-mile run in under 14 minutes and 21 seconds.\n\nThe changes, the department said, \"will allow the NYPD to attract more potential officers while maintaining academic and fitness standards.\"\n\nThe Post reported last month that the number of NYPD applicants has plummeted in recent years - from 18,000 in 2017 to just 8,000 this year, a 55% decline, based on Police Benevolent Association data.\n\nThe department currently has 34,475 uniformed officers, down from 40,200 in 2000.\n\nNYPD Police Benevolent Association President Patrick Hendry fired back that changing the recruiting rules won't fix the problem.\n\n\"Tweaking the hiring standards alone won't solve the NYPD's staffing crisis,\" Hendry said. \"New York City is competing with other departments that not only have lower education requirements but also offer other benefits and better quality of life.\n\n\"Even those who do choose the NYPD will continue to view it as a stepping stone to a better policing job,\" he said. \"Instead of another Band-Aid, New York City needs to look at long-term solutions and incentives that will help us recruit and retain the finest.\"\n\nCity Council Minority Leader Joann Ariola called the changes \"good measures,\" but said other factors, including soft-on-crime state criminal justice reforms, need to be addressed.\n\nAriola (R-Queens) said cited \"all the officers have to deal with from not having qualified immunity to the state laws that allow criminals back on the streets crime after crime.\n\n\"I am not sure any changes in recruitment will help,\" she said. \"We need to focus on changing what drove people out of the department and what keeps them from joining - bad laws from the state.\"\n\nAdams, a former police captain, backed the changes unveiled by his police commissioner.\n\n\"Public safety and justice are the prerequisites to prosperity, and as we continue to see record declines in crime across our city, we know we must take bold, decisive action to ensure we are doing everything in our power to put more officers on the streets and keep New York City the safest big city in America,\" he said in a statement.\n\n- Additional reporting by Larry Celona and Craig McCarthy\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "Sergeants leaving NYPD in droves - thanks to massive pay dispute\n\nThe NYPD is losing sergeants in droves as New York City leaders scale back the allure of achieving the rank for police officers, who can make more in annual salary due to a system that allows experienced members of the rank-and-file to make more than freshly promoted supervisors.\n\nUnder an expired contract, pay for sergeants starts at $98,000 and is capped at $118,000 after roughly five years, according to the NYPD's Sergeants Benevolent Association (SBA).\n\nPatrol officers top out at $115,000 - meaning hundreds of sergeants make less than thousands of rank-and-file cops who have reached top pay for their position.\n\n\"We're going to have guys potentially in the next year, year and a half that will be making upwards of anywhere between 9 to $15,000 less than a police officer,\" said Vincent Vallelong, the president of the SBA. \"So you're going to take a rank with more responsibility, you took a test, three tests, and at the end of the day, you're losing money.\"\n\nOver the course of a career, a sergeant could lose out on $80,000 to $100,000 in earnings, he said.\n\nRather than creating a step program to incrementally increase sergeants' pay, city taxpayers could be on the hook for an estimated $170 million if sergeants are promoted to top pay to outpace their subordinates, according to the SBA.\n\n\"It doesn't seem like anyone's priorities are in the right place, because back in the '90s, when the city needed to be turned around and we corrected crime, it was the NYPD that did it,\" Vallelong told Fox News Digital.\n\nFor comparison, the city reached a $220 million deal with the Roosevelt Hotel, owned by the government of Pakistan, to house illegal immigrants.\n\n\"They're bleeding money, the city, in all the wrong places,\" Vallelong said. \"Somebody in city governance either needs to go, or they really need to sit down and think this through and go back to basics. ... Go back to basic math. Go back to basic economics.\"\n\nThere are about 4,300 sergeants in the NYPD currently, roughly 200 shy of the target, according to the SBA. More than 70 left the department in January 2025, and 1,100 are eligible to retire by June.\n\nOthers have been promoted to lieutenant in another blow to staffing levels.\n\nAn estimated 1,200 active-duty sergeants are working second jobs to make ends meet in the high-cost metropolitan area.\n\n\"We are currently going through the mediation process with the SBA and are committed to coming to a fair solution that will continue to protect public safety,\" a spokesperson for New York City Mayor Eric Adams told Fox News Digital on Monday.\n\nWhile they see additional work in their normal range of duties due to understaffing, NYPD sergeants have also been given new assignments ranging from monitoring low-level nonemergency calls, vehicle pursuits from outside their own units, and reviewing hours of bodycam video on a monthly basis, according to the SBA.\n\nThose jobs give them less time to go out on patrol in New York City.\n\nIn that environment, officials worry top-pay officers will have no motivation to take promotion exams, earn promotions and refill depleted ranks.\n\nContract negotiations that had been scheduled for the first week of February were postponed, and Vallelong said the city has ignored proposals from the SBA.\n\nAdams, a former NYPD captain himself, previously said he would reach a new contract agreement. His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.\n\n\"The mayor was a sergeant at one point in time. He had to be in order to get to the point where he's at,\" Vallelong said. \"And you would think that he would understand this more than anybody else, because I guarantee you that if push came to shove, he's not taking this rank unless he's getting compensated the right way.\"\n\nDepartments around the country are struggling with recruitment and retention, making experienced NYPD members attractive to smaller departments where the cost of living is lower, while those departments also increasingly appeal to cops fed up with life in the Big Apple.\n\nAs a result, according to the SBA, NYPD members now face an increased workload while they have less experience overall.\n\n\"The mayor was just up in Albany asking for more money for migrants,\" Vallelong said. \"I know he's had meetings with the president ... maybe he should ask the president to step in like Clinton did back in those years and pass a bill in order to further law enforcement and recruit people and make it more of a respectable job again.\"\n\n\"We have already spent over $7 billion on this crisis alone, and the previous administration committed only $237 million in funding to help house the migrants in our care and for future services,\" a City Hall spokesperson told Fox News Monday. \"We have continued to receive previously allocated reimbursements through the past week. We will discuss this matter directly with federal officials.\"\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "NYPD begin overnight patrols of subway in renewed safety effort\n\nNew York City began increasing its police patrols on its subway overnight in an effort to combat crime on the transit system.\n\nSpikes in crime on the subway have put the system in the national spotlight as offenses ranging from petty theft to stabbings and murders have been publicized in the past year. Gov. Kathy Hochul (D-NY) pushed for the New York City Police Department to patrol every train during overnight hours as part of her plan to address crime on the subway during her State of the State address earlier this month.\n\n\"I want to see uniformed police on the platforms, but more importantly, we will put an officer on every single train, overnight, 9 p.m. to 5 a.m., over the next six months, and the state will support these efforts financially,\" Hochul said.\n\nThe overnight patrols began Monday, with NYPD Chief of Transit Joseph Gulotta saying the two-officer-per-train initiative was being phased in, beginning with the A, G, J, and F trains.\n\n\"Last night, we started our rollout of a police officer on every train on the overnights. It was very successful. We were able to get them out onto those trains as we go forward, it's going to be a phased role, like the mayor said, and we plan to have a police officer in every train shortly on the overnights,\" Gulotta said at a press conference Tuesday.\n\nGulotta said the goal is that the NYPD will be present on each train during the overnight hours and that the conductor will announce this. He also noted that police step on and off the train at each platform, saying the officers will be \"highly visible.\"\n\n\"I think this is going to be a very effective way for us to move forward with this,\" Gulotta said.\n\nThe initiative was one of the several proposals Hochul unveiled at her address, including installing more barriers and better lighting at stations to curb fare evaders.\n\n\"This will not only make the subway less chaotic, it will help strengthen the financial footing of the MTA,\" Hochul said."

      "text": "What NYPD budget cuts mean for the future of public safety: 'Streets will become even bloodier'\n\nT he New York City Police Department will see the worst budget cuts in decades, threatening the city's public safety after Mayor Eric Adams proposed cuts to every department to offset millions of dollars drained from the migrant crisis.\n\nAdams said the next five police academy classes will be canceled, reducing the number of officers from 33,000 to 29,000 in the next two years. The city's police department will be below 30,000 for the first time since the 1980s. According to the Adams administration, the NYPD's $5.6 billion budget will be cut by about $132 million next year.\n\nEGG PRODUCERS AND TWO TRADE GROUPS INFLATED PRICES FOR YEARS, FEDERAL JURY FINDS\n\nA second round of budget cuts was sent to the City Council last week, but Adams will spare the NYPD, FDNY, and Department of Sanitation. Leaving out major departments from the cuts will force the administration to make major cuts to migrant services. The City Council has yet to approve the first round of cuts, which will slash every city department's budget by 5% and will have to decide on the second round as well.\n\nAdams has already received blowback from the city's law enforcement over the budget cuts, which will result in a major hiring freeze, sounding the alarm over a potential decline in public safety.\n\n\"In essence, NYPD is being defunded,\" retired Lt. Randy Sutton, founder of The Wounded Blue, told the Washington Examiner. \"That's the reality of the decision that Mayor Adams has taken. As a result of that, the public safety is going to be more and more jeopardized.\"\n\nSutton founded The Wounded Blue, an organization that helps injured or disabled police officers through healing services. Sutton, a retired lieutenant who served for 10 years as a police officer in the state of New Jersey and 24 years with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, said the cuts are cause for concern as the city experiences a high rate of violent crimes.\n\nOverall, New York City's total major crimes spiked by 22.4% last year, up from 103,388 incidents in 2021 to 126,537 in 2022. End-of-the-year statistics from the NYPD showed murders were down 11.1%, but other crime is up in categories of rapes, robberies, felony assaults, burglaries, grand larcenies, and grand larceny autos.\n\n\"When you have so few cops to police so many people in an area the size of New York that has seen some incredible rises of violent crime. Well, that means more cops are going to get hurt, and we're seeing it right now,\" Sutton said.\n\nHowever, five of the seven most serious crime categories declined in the first six months of 2023. The latest data collected from the NYPD shows murders, rapes, and burglaries are each down 10% compared to last year.\n\nThe NYC Democratic Socialists of America have called on leaders to defund the police, pushing their calls amid the Black Lives Matter movement and through police violence against minorities, but said they don't support a 5% cut to every city department's budget.\n\n\"NYC-DSA has long supported public safety as an important priority and goal for the working people of New York City,\" NYC-DSA said in a statement to the Washington Examiner. \"We do not support a budget that cuts 5% across all city agencies and disproportionally hurts our most vulnerable communities.\"\n\n\"Public safety includes fully funded social services, fire, sanitation, parks, public education, public libraries, CUNY and MTA. We condemn budget cuts that pit working-class New Yorkers against each other whether they're seeking asylum or already live here - we have to fund the city that meets the needs of everyone,\" NYC-DSA added.\n\nA Jewish organization for racial and economic justice, Jews For Racial & Economic Justice (JFREJ), said despite the NYPD budget reductions, the department will still be receiving billions of dollars while other agencies have a much lower budget and are still undergoing cuts, such as housing, workforce development, harm reduction, combating poverty, education, and healthcare.\n\n\"The Mayor's mismanagement of our city has been so disastrous that he's no longer able to spare the NYPD from budget reductions as he sought to do in the past. But to be clear, the NYPD is still receiving billions while other critical services are egregiously underfunded,\" JFREJ said in a statement to the Washington Examiner . \"In recent days, the NYPD has decided to spend $390 million (which amounts to almost the entirety of the public library budget) on an encrypted radio system to replace their public radios, which provided key evidence about Officer Daniel Pantaleo's killing of Eric Garner.\"\n\nSutton emphasized that not enough people respect officers these days, citing a specific example last week when two NYPD officers were assaulted after asking a group to stop smoking their cigarettes at the Freeman train station in the Bronx. Sutton said with fewer police officers on duty, the streets will become \"even bloodier places.\"\n\n\"This shows a diminishment in the respect and also a diminishment in the fearful consequences that is now permeating the city of New York's criminal justice system,\" Sutton said.\n\n\"You add the no bail, low bail insanity that has been put into place by the governor and the state legislature, and you have the results that are coming,\" Sutton added. \"As less and less police officers are available to police that city, it is going to become even more and more exacerbated, and the streets are going to become even bloodier places.\"\n\nFour years ago, New York state implemented a law that essentially eliminates cash bail in most cases involving misdemeanors and nonviolent felonies.\n\nSutton also called out a \"failure to retain people on a level that we've never seen in policing history.\" Police departments nationwide are experiencing declining forces, which Sutton said is due to counties and cities making it \"unattractive to become a cop\" to the point that they \"can't even hire anyone.\"\n\nAcross the nation, The Los Angeles Police Department has only 8,995 police officers as of August, making it the smallest the force has been since the 1990s. Over two decades ago, the LAPD saw a record high of 9,895 officers, and then-Chief Bill Bratton called those numbers too low for policing the size and population of the city.\n\nFor months, New York City leaders have blamed the Biden administration and the federal government for not providing enough support as the city faces an increasingly expensive migrant crisis.\n\n\"I tell people all the time when they stop me on the subway system 'don't yell at me, yell at D.C. Yell at D.C.' We deserve better as a city,\" Adams said at a town hall Monday. \"D.C. has abandoned us, and they need to be paying their cost to this national problem.\"\n\nThe city was accommodating at least 130,000 migrants as of mid-October, according to the Adams administration, which has led to a drainage of resources leading to major budget cuts.\n\n\"Law enforcement is facing a crisis like we've never seen before. This is the perfect storm of a public safety crisis,\" Sutton said. \"You have the lack of a commitment by the federal state, county, and city governments to take law enforcement seriously. And instead of putting policies and laws into place that create an environment for safety, they have done just the opposite. They have passed laws that don't allow the police to police.\""

Patrol Chief John Chell took to X to respond to remarks from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), who slammed the department for deploying its counterterrorism unit on campus after arresting 100 protesters on suspicion of trespassing. Among them was Rep. Ilhan Omar's (D-MN) daughter, Isra Hirsi , who was subsequently suspended.\n\n\"Not only did Columbia make the horrific decision to mobilize NYPD on their own students, but the units called in have some of the most violent reputations on the force,\" Ocasio-Cortez wrote Wednesday. \"NYPD had promised the city they wouldn't deploy [Strategic Response Group] to protests.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez also came to Hirsi's defense promptly following her suspension, pointing to the fact she had \"no disciplinary record\" and accused the school of engaging in \"asymmetric crackdowns on Palestinian human rights protests.\"\n\n\"Truly amazing!

Officers arrived at the request of Columbia University, which reported the danger.\n\n\"The only incidents that day on campus were the student's hateful anti-Semitic speech and vile language towards our cops. I am sure you agree any hateful speech is unacceptable.

The photo showed gas masks, ear plugs, helmets, goggles, tape, hammers, knives, ropes, and a book on terrorism. The book is by Charles Townshend, Professor of International History at Keele University in England. It was published in 2011 and is 161 pages.\n\n\"These are not the tools of students protesting, these are the tools of agitators, of people who were working on something nefarious,\" Daughtry said on X. \"Thankfully, your NYPD was able to prevent whatever they were planning and stop them before they could do it.\"\n\nKemper asked who was organizing the protests.\n\n\"However, as we have been stating for the past 2 weeks, there is an underlying radical indoctrination of some of these students. Vulnerable and young people being influenced by professional agitators. Who is funding and leading this movement?\" Kemper asked on X.\n\nKemper also posted a letter from The New School requesting the NYPD's assistance in removing protesters from their campus on Friday.\n\n\"The actions and continuing escalation of these individuals are a substantial disruption of the educational environment and regular operations of the university,\" the letter stated.\n\nThe New School is a university in New York City. It closed all academic building on Friday and classes were moved to online. The college said classes on campus would resume Saturday.\n\nFox News reported that 56 protesters were arrested at The New School and New York University."

      "text": "Law enforcement prepared to take down 'explosive' drones at Macy's fireworks show\n\nEXCLUSIVE - The New York Police Department and FBI are prepared to take down any hostile, even explosive-laden, drone that poses a threat to the thousands in attendance at the Macy's July 4th Fireworks Show Thursday.\n\nNYPD Deputy Commissioner of Operations Kaz Daughtry told the Washington Examiner in an exclusive interview Tuesday that the fireworks display is a no-fly zone during the event, and the agency will have a federal drone mitigation team on site Thursday evening to respond to any problematic unmanned aerial systems flying over the crowds on the Hudson River.\n\n\"With the technology the drone has, we don't know with these hostile drones what type of technology they have in them,\" Daughtry said. \"Our biggest concern here is if they have some sort of explosive device that's attached to the drone and want to put it over a large group of people and detonate it. That's just a huge concern for this agency.\"\n\nThe NYPD and FBI have not publicly disclosed any known threat, and the event will be heavily policed, as is the case for all major events in the city. Other drone operators, such as spectators trying to get a good picture from the sky, can also expect to have their drones taken down.\n\n\"Let's say I decided to put a drone up, and it's not registered with the department. Like, it goes through our permitting process,\" said Daughtry. \"[The FBI] can take that drone down and return it back to base, where it launched from.\"\n\nThe NYPD will have its own counterterrorism teams on-site at the fireworks show and some of its 85 drones up in the air to keep an eye on the crowds.\n\nNew York police have their own drone mitigation software and can track what is flying in the sky. However, local and state police cannot take down an unpermitted or hostile drone - only federal authorities, such as the FBI or Department of Homeland Security, have the legal authority to do so.\n\nFederal law enforcement from the FBI and the DHS met with NYPD officials in New York earlier this week to discuss the plans for securing the fireworks show, according to Daughtry.\n\nWhile drones are often thought of as toys, officials have become increasingly worried in recent years about the threat they pose.\n\nIn January 2015 , a drunken government employee infamously flew a drone over the White House grounds. The incident was followed by similar ones again in May and again in October , prompting government and private-sector officials to consider the need to protect vulnerable places due to the fresh possibility for spying or attacks.\n\nIn 2018, the DHS and FBI identified drones as one of the greatest national security threats to America - rating it as severe a concern as cybersecurity hacks, critical infrastructure attacks, and terrorism.\n\nDrones are already used by transnational criminal syndicates and drug cartels that use them to move substances such as fentanyl over the border wall and spy on federal authorities at the border. The technology is readily available to terrorist groups.\n\nThe National Football League's top security official is just as worried about drones as the federal government. Cathy Lanier, a former chief of police in Washington, D.C., who now serves as NFL vice president of security, testified before the Senate during the Trump administration that the league had documented nearly a dozen drone incidents in 2018.\n\nTaking drones out of the sky is a new and evolving problem for police. Physically shooting a drone is nearly impossible, given that they can fly extremely fast and often go undetected hundreds of feet above ground and out of sight.\n\nAdditionally, a drone that is shot out of the sky could harm people or animals below it.\n\nHandheld systems, similar to bullpup rifles, can send an invisible electronic signal to the drone with instructions that override what the pilot is telling the drone to do. These tools can also jam local cell phone towers to halt all other activity in order to get that electronic communication to the drone instantly.\n\nOther devices create an invisible blanket over an area that prohibits drones from flying into them. Both types of counterdrone measures are less than a decade old and are rarely used by federal, state, and local law enforcement due to legal constraints and cost.\n\nRep. Anthony D'Esposito (R-NY), whose district includes part of Long Island, has focused on the drone concern and counterdrone measures during his time as chairman of the House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Emergency Management and Technology.\n\n\"Ensuring law enforcement agencies across the country have the resources needed to combat threats posed by drone use remains a central focus of my work on the House Homeland Security Committee, and I will continue working with former colleagues from the NYPD as well as other partners in law enforcement to safeguard the public,\" said D'Esposito in a statement to the Washington Examiner."

      "text": "NYPD Faces Uncertain Future Amid New York's Growing Political Crisis\n\nAuthored by Michael Watson via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),\n\nWith the resignation of New York City Police Department (NYPD) Commissioner Edward Caban amid a federal probe of Mayor Eric Adams's administration, city officials are facing a public trust crisis.\n\nAdd to that an incident last weekend in which officers in a Brooklyn subway station opened fire on an alleged turnstile jumper armed with a knife and accidentally shot a fellow officer and a bystander.\n\nThe police force and mayoral administration are both scrambling to regain credibility, according to Michael Alcazar, an adjunct professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan and a retired NYPD detective.\n\nWhen Caban stepped down, the mayor moved swiftly to appoint Tom Donlon, a law enforcement professional with a long record of involvement in criminal and terrorist cases, as Caban's successor.\n\nGiven Adams's stance as a tough-on-crime, pro-law enforcement official, the mayor's political fortunes depend heavily on the NYPD's ability to right its course in the aftermath of the Caban corruption scandal.\n\n\" The NYPD's image has undoubtedly been affected by the Caban scandal ,\" Alcazar told The Epoch Times in an email on Sept. 16. \"Mayor Adams and Donlon will both face the challenge of communicating their new strategies to the New York communities they serve and working to rebuild trust and confidence.\"\n\nSince Caban stepped down, the mayor canceled an appearance at a Sept. 16 fundraiser, just two days after his chief legal adviser, Lisa Zornberg, resigned without notice. Zornberg's very brief resignation letter said she could no longer effectively serve in her role.\n\nTiffany Cabán, a New York City Council member from Queens, has called for the mayor to resign, as has Emily Gallagher, a state assemblywoman from Brooklyn, and state Sen. Julia Salazar, also of Brooklyn.\n\nIn a Sept. 13 post on social media platform X, Salazar wrote: \" We've seen enough. I am tired of a lack of accountability from executives at every level of government. Several FBI investigations and too much harm done to the best city in the world. Time to step aside and allow for new leadership.\"\n\nAlcazar told The Epoch Times that he believes that Adams has taken steps to assure the public that he is still firmly in control.\n\nBut amid the turbulence over Caban's resignation, the arrests of high-ranking officials in the New York City Fire Department, and continuing scrutiny of the mayor's actions, the police department and the Adams administration have both suffered reputational damage, Alcazar said.\n\n\"The appointment of Tom Donlon as interim commissioner, given his background in federal investigations, indicates tha t Mayor Adams aims to emphasize integrity and law enforcement credibility during this transitional phase ,\" he stated.\n\nAlcazar said he sees this as a stopgap measure amid the political turbulence, allowing Donlon to review and, if necessary, reorganize NYPD ranks.\n\nIt is a prelude to the selection of a subordinate close to the mayor, he said, adding that Donlon and Adams face the daunting task of trying to persuade the public that the corruption and abuse that precipitated the current scandal will not reoccur.\n\nThe department's and the mayor's reputations may be beyond repair, according to Robert Gangi, director of the Police Reform Organizing Project, a New York-based advocacy group that seeks to curb what it views as widespread abuse and discrimination on the part of the NYPD.\n\nA community organizer and activist who has followed the relationship between the police and the mayor's office through several administrations, Gangi said that although the NYPD is supposed to be free from political influence and putting public safety and neutral law enforcement above other concerns, the NYPD is really under the control of one person-the mayor.\n\nThe current situation is similar to that under Mayor Rudy Giuliani in the 1990s, Gangi told The Epoch Times by phone on Sept. 16.\n\n\"[Giuliani] pushed Bill Bratton out of the role within two years, and he essentially was setting the main policies for the department,\" he said. \"We see similar circumstances with Adams as mayor, so we don't see any prospect of significant changes under the new commissioner.\"\n\nAny proposed changes to NYPD practices will require a green light from the mayor, who wields effective control, Gangi said.\n\nAs an example of what he sees as a needed policy change, he noted that when someone on the street has a psychiatric crisis, a call to a 911 operator triggers a police response. That isn't appropriate in a situation in which mental health professionals are more suited to deal with the person in crisis, Gangi said.\n\nAny proposed city measure requiring such a policy change is unlikely to pass even though some members of the City Council agree with it in principle, he said.\n\nAnother reform would be to end the dispatching of police to handle traffic violations -even ones as trivial as broken taillights, he said, noting, \"Those changes are fundamental.\"\n\nThe NYPD and the mayor's office did not respond to requests for comment by publication time.\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "New York Police Commissioner Resigns Amid Federal Probe\n\nAuthored by Michael Washburn via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),\n\nNew York City Police Commissioner Edward Caban on Sept. 12 resigned from his position, days after his phone was seized in a federal investigation.\n\nCaban said he made the decision to resign after the \"news around recent developments\" had \"created a distraction for our department,\" according to an email to the police department obtained by The Associated Press.\n\n\" I am unwilling to let my attention be on anything other than our important work, or the safety of the men and women of the NYPD ,\" he added.\n\nThe Epoch Times has contacted the New York Police Department for more details.\n\nNew York Mayor Eric Adams said Thursday that he accepted Caban's resignation. \"I respect his decision and I wish him well,\" he said in a streamed appearance from the Mayor's mansion.\n\nCaban had been on the job for a little over a year, having been appointed by Mayor Eric Adams in July 2023.\n\nThe resignation comes as part of a federal probe of high-ranking members of the Adams administration.\n\nOn Sept. 4, federal law enforcement officials seized Caban's phone and those of his brother James, Adams's first deputy mayor, schools chancellor, and others close to the mayor.\n\nFederal agents also raided the homes of several administration officials. Federal authorities have not disclosed the subject of the investigation or whether there are multiple probes.\n\nAdams said that Tom Donlon, a law enforcement veteran with experience in antiterrorism efforts, has been appointed interim commissioner.\n\nDonlon served as the city's director of the Office of Homeland Security, led the FBI's national threat center, and played a role in investigating the 1993 World Trade Center attack. He started his own security firm in 2020.\n\nIn the days leading up to the resignation, members of the New York City Council, which has feuded repeatedly with the mayor over issues such as solitary confinement in the city's jails, the accommodation of migrants from out of state, and the recording of data on persons whom the police arrest, pushed for Caban to step down.\n\nIn November 2023, agents took the mayor's phone and iPad in order to examine them for evidence relating to his fundraising activities during his 2021 mayoral run.\n\nAs police commissioner, Caban has played a central role in Adams's efforts to fight crime and promote public safety. But under Caban's leadership, the NYPD's recent record on this front has been mixed.\n\nAccording to NYPD statistics for the week ending Sept. 8, 251 murders have occurred in New York City so far in 2024, only a relatively slight decline from the 288 recorded for the same period in 2023.\n\nIn other categories of serious crime, such as rapes and robberies, the rates are higher than the same period last year, the figures show.\n\nA total of 1,119 rapes happened in the city in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 1,008 in the same period in 2023, while 11,536 robberies were recorded, up from 11,358 in the equivalent 2023 period.\n\nIn an email to The Epoch Times, Brendan McGuire, an attorney at the law firm WilmerHale which is representing Adams in the federal probe, said he had no comment.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "New Republic Blames NRA for Deaths of Assassinated NYPD Officers\n\nY esterday, I critiqued an article in The New Republic by Claire Groden which argued the anti-police protesters weren't to blame for the murders of two NYPD officers last weekend and that the responsibility was that of the gunman alone.\n\nToday, The New Republic is singing a different tune. According to an article written by Rebecca Leber, it's the NRA's fault that the two officers are dead :\n\nThe last year when Ismaaiyl Brinsley - the man who killed two New York City cops on Saturday - should have been able to buy or carry a gun was 2008, when he was convicted of felony shoplifting, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution . In 2011, he pleaded guilty to more felonies after he shot a woman's car with a stolen handgun. Over his life, he had 19 arrests in Ohio and Georgia.\n\nAs a felon, Brinsley was barred under federal law from buying a gun. Had he undergone a background check, he would have failed it and authorities could be notified. Yet the National Rifle Association argues that bad guys will get their hands on guns regardless of the law. The lobby points to violence in states with strong gun laws as evidence of gun control's ineffectiveness.\n\nIn fact, it's weak gun laws that enable felons, domestic abusers, and the mentally ill to arm themselves. Whereas licensed gun sellers must conduct background checks, unlicensed secondary market sellers face no such requirement in more laissez-faire states.\n\nSo Leber contends that if only Brinsley had undergone a background check, the two officers would still alive. Well, let's take a closer look at that AJC article shall we:\n\nHis record started just before his 18th birthday in 2004 with a simple battery charge in Atlanta. From there he seemed to be arrested almost every subsequent year with charges ranging from disorderly conduct to carrying a concealed weapon. In 2007, he was charged with criminal trespassing in DeKalb County. By 2008, the year he turned 22, he had been convicted of felony shoplifting, a conviction that should have barred him from carrying a firearm. But by the summer of 2011 he got a stolen Phoenix Arms .25 caliber, semi automatic handgun and shot a woman's gold, 2007 Chevrolet Malibu in Cobb County. He resisted when police tried to arrest him.\n\nYou read that right. Brimsley used a stolen gun during the 2011 incident. Interesting that Leber does not see fit to mention that detail.\n\nYes, it's true that Brimsley should not have been able to carry a firearm. But as the above paragraph establishes, Brimsley was a criminal who held the law with little regard. As evidenced by his actions on Saturday, Brimsley had even less regard for the people who enforce the law.\n\nYet Leber's article would have you believe that Brimsley had somehow legally obtained a firearm despite his felony conviction and was able to obtain one because of supposedly lax gun laws thanks to the NRA.\n\nThe fact is, at this point, we do not know how Brimsley obtained the weapon he used to kill the NYPD officers . The weapon was not reported stolen. It was purchased at a pawn shop in Georgia in 1996 when Brimsley was 9-years-old.\n\nWhat we do know is, given his previous criminal history and the hatred his in heart, even the most restrictive gun law would not have deterred Brimsley from murdering two police officers, never mind shooting his own girlfriend.\n\nBut it's always been much easier for the The New Republic and The Left at large to blame the NRA. I very much doubt that anyone remaining at The New Republic would have the gumption to condemn the excesses of some of their allies who wanted, and then got, dead cops.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "Taking the Knee in the New Vanities of the Bonfires Status degradation of the NYPD.\n\nA t the height of the rioting this past weekend in New York City, Terence Monaham, the chief of the NYPD, hugged demonstrators and took a knee with protesters in Greenwich Village. Calling for an end to the violence in the city, the police chief urged for the \"continuation of peaceful protests\" and asked those gathered to condemn violence. ABC7 reported that Monaham told the outlet that \"we hugged to show there's solidarity.\"\n\nBoasting that New York City is going to \"show the country how this is done,\" Monaham said that the protest leaders asked him to take a knee with demonstrators to \"encourage peace.\" But it was a short-lived peace as a few hours after the hugging and knee-taking, peaceful protests turned violent again with looting, vandalism, and arson. In fact, the city has become so violent and the riots so destructive that on Tuesday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo sharply criticized the NYPD and Mayor Bill de Blasio: \"The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night. It was rampant looting across the city last night that they did not stop. Look at the videos - it was a disgrace.\"\n\nThey understand that the horrific treatment afforded to George Floyd was an aberration and they are disgusted by it. But to take a knee that suggests systemic racism within the NYPD is a bridge too far for many in the rank and file.\n\nStill, the knee-taking continues. In fact, symbolic knee-taking ceremonies for police officers - akin to the tribal status degradation ceremonies that anthropologists write about - are now being demanded of the police by the protesters. Taking the knee was never about encouraging peace. Taking the knee has always been an angry symbol of protest against protesters' perceptions of rampant police brutality and racism. Born out of demonstrations against racism and brutality by Black Power advocates and civil rights activists - and often accompanied by a raised fist - the symbol was revived by one-time NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who became famous for taking the knee during the national anthem to protest racism. Kaepernick himself said that he took a knee \"for the people who are on the streets, who are being abused. For cops who are abusing their authority.\"\n\nTaking the knee was always a protest against the police. This is why it is so disturbing for the many good police officers who know that their fellow officers are equally committed to protecting and serving the public. Taking the knee to protest their fellow officers is anathema to good police officers. They understand that the horrific treatment afforded to George Floyd was an aberration and they are disgusted by it. But to take a knee that suggests systemic racism within the NYPD is a bridge too far for many in the rank and file.\n\nUnfortunately, the status degradation ceremonies for police officers continue to escalate throughout the five boroughs of New York City and in other parts of the country. On Sunday in Foley Square, hundreds of protesters chanted \"NYPD, take a knee\" until the uniformed NYPD police officers gave in to their demands. Those officers unwilling to participate in the new street theater are derided while those who take the knee are cheered.\n\nMuch of this recalls Tom Wolfe's The Bonfire of the Vanities - a satirical novel of racial politics in New York City in the 1980s. Often described as that decade's defining novel, it offered a scathing portrayal of the racial power struggles permeating the city at the time. Wolfe's brilliant satire skewered the rich, portrayed a corrupt legal system that was up for sale, and presented a cast of pandering politicians and community activists more interested in helping themselves than helping the poor. The police officers in the novel are portrayed primarily as good men just trying to do their job, but their police department was also held captive to craven politicians and prosecutors. One of the main characters in the book, Reverend Bacon, spends most of his time shaking down rich white power brokers and philanthropists - telling them that money going to his organization is an investment in \"steam control\" of black anger.\n\nWolfe acknowledged that he modeled Reverend Bacon after the Rev. Al Sharpton, who, more than 30 years later, is injecting himself again into steam control. Last week, Sharpton held a prayer vigil at the Minneapolis site where George Floyd died. Accompanied by Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, an unarmed young black man who had died while in NYPD police custody in 2014, Sharpton told those gathered that \"If they had prosecuted that [NYPD] officer, maybe Floyd would be alive today.... We're going to make sure that this prosecution goes down.\" Sharpton has pledged he'll return to Minneapolis for Floyd's memorial. Promising \"justice\" for Floyd's death, Sharpton recently said, \"There's a difference between peace and quiet. Some people just want quiet. The price for peace is justice.\" It is a high price.\n\nIn 1968, following the Rev. Martin Luther King riots, then-Mayor John Lindsay argued that American blacks were so severely damaged by slavery that their ability to succeed was seriously in doubt unless whites cared enough to do something about it. According to The Ungovernable City: John Lindsay and His Struggle to Save New York by Vincent J. Cannato, Lindsay once told reporters that \"we have three hundred years of neglect to pay for.\" Creating the New York Urban Coalition, Lindsay channeled more than $4 million in 1968 and close to $6 million 1969 to job training for inner city residents, academies for at-risk children, and aid for minority businesses. All of the funds were raised privately. In his book, Cannato writes that \"business elites, frightened by urban riots, gave money to the Urban Coalition to buy off the urban poor\" - what Tom Wolfe called \"steam control.\"\n\nSteam control is much more difficult to maintain now. Humiliating the NYPD is just the start. These same kinds of Urban Coalition programs are already being demanded as the price for justice for George Floyd. But it is much less likely that today's business elites - many of whom have watched their own businesses looted and burned - will be as willing to contribute to steam control programs as they might have been in the past.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "Implicit Bias Training: A Pseudoscience Scam A total waste of taxpayer dollars.\n\nP olice officers in a majority of states are now mandated to receive \"implicit bias training,\" where they are informed they are subconsciously racist and must admit to and deliberately overcome their racism.\n\nThe trainings, which exploded in popularity following the Ferguson riots in 2014, directly respond to accusations that racist police officers are shooting unarmed African Americans. Following the death of George Floyd, multiple states, including Michigan , New Jersey , and Texas , joined the list of states mandating the training for all their officers.\n\nHarvard's University's Implicit Association Test , the foundation of the idea of implicit bias, shows that a majority of Americans associate African Americans more quickly with negative words than white Americans when measured in milliseconds. The theory is that these unconscious biases can cause police officers to use a disparate amount of force against African Americans or use racial profiling to stop and arrest African Americans at greater rates.\n\nBut we know from study after study that so-called \"implicit bias\" has only the slightest link to how a person actually behaves towards people of different races.\n\nSo it's no surprise that a new study shows that the NYPD's $5.5 million implicit bias training program, which began in 2018, has absolutely no impact on officer behavior.\n\nProponents of the training expected that New York's police officers would interact with and arrest fewer African Americans after becoming aware of their supposed deep-seated and unconscious racism. However, stops, frisks, summonses, and arrests of African Americans in New York remained at almost the same proportion of police actions following the implementation of the implicit bias training.\n\n\"It's fair to say that we could not detect effects of the training on officers' enforcement behaviors,\" said Robert E. Worden, the lead researcher of the study.\n\nOne explanation for the failure of implicit bias training to have any tangible effect is that the quality of the training is low. Mahzarin Banaji, a psychology professor at Harvard who helped create the Implicit Association Test, subscribes to this belief.\n\n\"The teaching has been in the hands of people called 'diversity trainers,' and they're like politicians - they don't have to have any expertise,\" Banaji told NPR.\n\nThis excuse, while lacking in substance, does drive at an important question. How could an hours-long training session - whatever the quality of its techniques or the expertise of its teachers - fundamentally alter a person's behavior towards certain races if they truly have deep-seated racism?\n\nIn fact, many liberals have argued in recent months that people are too deeply racist for implicit bias training to have any effect. For instance, Dave Bicking, the vice president of Communities United Against Police Brutality, said in June that implicit bias training is \"unscientific fraud\" because \"it's not actually going to threaten any entrenched interests or cause any significant change in policing.\"\n\nBut that argument goes in the wrong direction. The reality is that \"implicit bias\" cannot be reliably determined and, further, it does not have real-life consequences. That is, implicit bias' existence as a meaningful descriptor is in serious question.\n\nThe Implicit Association Test serves as the basis for implicit bias theory, but people routinely get different results when they take the test multiple times. The first two times I took the test , it told me I had \"little to no automatic preference between White people and Black people.\" The third time I took the test, however, I was told I have \"a slight automatic preference for White people over Black people.\" Apparently I was judged not racist one minute, but racist the next.\n\n\"The IAT isn't even predicting the IAT two weeks later,\" Hart Blanton, a social psychologist critical of implicit bias, told the Chronicle of Higher Education . \"How can a test predict behavior if it can't even predict itself?\"\n\nThat lack of consistency has caused many to question the scientific validity of the test. Multiple studies published in highly regarded journals have found that the IAT does not meet the quality-control standards expected of psychological instruments. This h as further caused many to question whether such a test, which labels people as racist, should be distributed by Harvard and marketed as legitimate.\n\nIndeed, the test seems to be more effective at testing people's ability to sort pictures of people and words than discovering unknown prejudices.\n\nIn 2017, a meta-analysis of 492 studies with 87,418 participants found that there is only the slightest correlation between a person's level of implicit bias and their level of discriminatory behavior. Additionally, the researchers found that there is very little evidence that changes in implicit bias have anything to do with changes in a person's behavior.\n\nEssentially, the researchers found that implicit bias fails to describe anything meaningful about human behavior.\n\n\"When you actually look at the evidence we collected, there's not necessarily strong evidence for the conclusions people have drawn,\" said a co-author of the study, Patrick Forscher.\n\nAnother study, a 2013 meta-analysis , found a similar result. Those researchers said, \"the IAT provides little insight into who will discriminate against whom.\"\n\nIn fact, the 2017 study found that the correlation between implicit bias and behavior is even smaller than what the 2013 study found.\n\nSo the null effect of the NYPD's implicit bias training is actually caused by the fact that the training is based entirely on pseudoscience. A police officer can be measured by the IAT to more quickly associate African Americans with negative words, but this has no statistical bearing on how he will interact with African Americans. Making the officer fess up to his supposed racism just confuses his judgment.\n\nYet Black Lives Matter activists and left-wing academics continue to make calls for implicit bias trainings one of their central demands . And those demands have made implicit bias training into a big business. Consultants offer to help everyone from health-care professionals to corporations to university students to police departments overcome their racism in exchange for large sums of money.\n\nAnd it comes at the cost of millions in taxpayer dollars.\n\nPatricia Devine , who studies prejudice at the University of Wisconsin, said that implicit bias training for police departments is a \"multimillion, maybe billion, dollar industry.\" For example, $5.5 million was spent on two years of implicit bias training for the NYPD, the nation's largest police force.\n\nIn 2019, CBS News contacted 155 police departments across the country and learned that 69 percent of departments offer implicit bias training. Ninety percent of those departments make the training mandatory. And that number has only grown following the death of George Floyd.\n\nSo why are these activists so motivated to convince us that we, and our law enforcement officers, are secretly racists? Well, for diversity consultants and trainers, it's their business model. But for ideologues, it's a huge component of critical race theory.\n\nCritical race theory posits that our entire society is systemically racist and that this racism animates our society. Implicit bias is central to the ideology because it allows critical race theorists to find racism in every person, regardless of their actual behavior. Thus both Ibram X. Kendi and Robin DiAngelo, the arbiters of critical race theory, demand that their disciples confess their racism. \"The claim of 'not racist' neutrality,\" Kendi says in his book, \"is a mask for racism.\" (It should be noted that Kendi is made wealthy by critical race theory.)\n\nThe fact that taxpayer money is spent on this poisonous ideology is shameful. It's tearing our country apart and leading us to believe that everyone is secretly biased against people of other races.\n\nPresident Trump issued an executive order this month banning critical race and implicit bias trainings for federal employees and contractors. But we must also work to end the implicit bias training locally in states, cities, schools, and companies.\n\nThese counterproductive, ineffective trainings are in particular a problem for police, who are called to serve and protect the public. Police should be freed from the lie that they could be unknowingly racist and emboldened to act with right judgment towards all citizens.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "The Lunatic Left's 'Education' Asylums\n\nT hursday night in Greenwich Village, a woman let loose an obscenity-filled tirade against the police officers who were attempting to keep order outside New York University's Kimmel Student Center, where College Republicans were hosting a speech by comedian Gavin McInnes. Screaming that President Trump's supporters at the event were \"Nazis,\" the woman unleashed more than a dozen obscenities in less than two minutes. \"Why are you here?\" she screamed at the NYPD officers. \"You're not here to protect these students from Nazis. No, you're not! This is completely [bleeped] up. And these students had to [bleeping] face them on their own. You should be ashamed of yourselves! You should be standing up to those Nazis!\"\n\nThe idea that Republicans are Nazis from whom students need protection is widespread in academia, where the vast majority of professors are Democrats , and administrators impose \"safe spaces\" and \"trigger warnings\" to stifle dissent against the prevailing left-wing orthodoxy. (See \"The Cult of Social Justice,\" Dec. 21, 2015.) Hillary Clinton's defeat last November was a profound shock to many inside the campus bubble. Yale University canceled exams for students \"traumatized\" by the election. The University of Massachusetts offered \"grief counseling\" to students , with one official saying those with \"marginalized identities\" had suffered most from the campaign. At Virginia Tech the morning after the election, officials sent an email to students \"waking up with fear, anxiety, concern, questions, and confusion among many other emotions,\" directing them to campus services offering \"support.\" Did any universities offer counseling and support to Republican students after Mitt Romney lost in 2012? Of course not.\n\nOn the 21st-century campus, it's conservatives who are truly \"marginalized,\" but nobody offers a \"trigger warning\" before discussing Keynesian economics in class, and there are no \"safe spaces\" for, say, a Christian student who wishes to defend Bible-based morality. Even at an allegedly Catholic school like Marquette University, political science professor John McAdams was threatened with firing when he defended a student's right to express opposition to same-sex marriage. By contrast, Marquette administrators seem to have no problem with sociology professor Dawne Moon's avowed identity as a \"queer activist.\" Nor does anyone at Marquette condemn Professor Moon's assigning her sociology students selections from The Lesbian and Gay Studies Reader and The Sex, Gender & Sexuality Reader , including \"Masculinity as Homophobia: Fear, Shame, and Silence in the Construction of Gender Identity\" and \"Sexual Science and the Law: Regulating Sex - Reifying the Power of Heterosexual Men.\"\n\nCriticism of homosexuality is strictly forbidden in contemporary academia, but so also is the gay libertarian Milo Yiannopoulos . Last week's riot in Berkeley forced the cancellation of Yiannopoulos's scheduled speech at the University of California, and why? Yiannopoulos is pro-Trump, an opinion unacceptable to the radical mob at Berkeley. In the historic home of the 1964 Free Speech movement, it seems, no speech by Republicans is permitted. \"Yiannopoulos and his repulsive demeanor never belonged here,\" the student-run Daily Cal declared in an editorial. \"He isn't a productive member of society, and he certainly doesn't reflect the type of respectful and educated discourse UC Berkeley promotes.\" The \"respectful and educated discourse\" at Berkeley evidently includes a lot of vandalism and assault, however.\n\nOne day after the Berkeley riot, police in New York made 11 arrests during the wild demonstration outside the NYU event where Gavin McInnes spoke to the College Republicans. McInnes has been called the \"godfather of hipsterdom\" and frequently takes jabs at feminism and other forms of political correctness. He co-founded a group called \"Proud Boys\" that is about \"Western chauvinism,\" which has resulted in liberal journalists accusing McInnes of racism, even though the group's other co-founder is black. Yet like Yiannopoulos, McInnes's main offense is being pro-Trump. Liberals have decided Trump is Hitler, and the rowdy demonstrators at NYU seemed to believe that the College Republican event was a Nazi rally. This impression was heightened by protest signs (supplied by the Workers World Party, a notorious fringe Marxist group) with slogans like \"Smash Fascism & White Supremacy.\"\n\nThe woman yelling four-letter words at NYPD officers was not alone in thinking she was \"standing up to Nazis,\" she was just a bit more worked up about it. What struck many who watched the video of her hysterical tantrum, however, was that amid her screeching torrent of obscenities, she twice yelled: \"I'm professor!\" Internet sleuths soon identified her as Rebecca Goyette, an adjunct professor at Montclair State University in New Jersey. She describes her work as \"a largely queer, fantasy paradigm,\" exploring \"the remotest ranges of the subconscious mind.\" Professor Goyette last year staged an exhibit that included her fantasies of castrating Donald Trump .\n\nSuch are the \"remotest reaches of the subconscious mind\" of one academic. America used to put lunatics in mental institutions, but now we have turned our universities into asylums and put the lunatics in charge of them.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "The FBI: The 'Fix Be In'\n\nT he FBI's reputation has sunk so low under the Obama administration that its initials seem to stand for: The Fix Be In. The bureau's no-hurry investigation into Hillary Clinton's deleted State Department emails seemed engineered to see no evil. Meanwhile, the New York Times reports that Attorney General Loretta Lynch is replacing FBI agents and prosecutors who oppose charging New York police in the chokehold death of Eric Garner (because they aren't sure the police committed a crime and don't think they can get a conviction) with staff who want to throw the book at NYPD.\n\nPundits have voiced their fear that Donald Trump would use the Justice Department to go after his political enemies - and rightly so after Trump said he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton and send her to jail. (So much for the presumption of innocence.) How can these same critics not see how the Obama Department of Justice has turned into a political arm of the Democratic Party?\n\nConsider the Clinton investigation. The FBI granted limited immunity to five Clinton aides, including Paul Combetta, who deleted Clinton emails in March 2015 after Congress had subpoenaed her records. FBI agents waited a year before they questioned Clinton in July for an hour and a half. Shortly thereafter, Director James Comey announced there would be no indictment in the case; even though Clinton did not hand over \"several thousand\" work emails to the State Department, there was no proof of \"intentional misconduct.\"\n\nLynch didn't help herself when she met privately with former President Bill Clinton on a Phoenix tarmac on July 2, while the investigation was under way. Lynch later admitted the meeting \"cast a shadow\" on her decision-making on the case, but assured the public she would \"be accepting\" the FBI prosecutors' recommendation.\n\nNew York police should be so lucky. As the Times reported, FBI officials in New York oppose bringing charges against Officer Daniel Pantaleo and others involved in the 2014 arrest of Eric Garner, 43, for selling bootleg cigarettes. Pantaleo wrapped an arm around Garner's neck. Garner protested, \"I can't breathe.\" (After an ambulance arrived, Garner had a heart attack.) It is painful to watch video of the fateful arrest, but a state grand jury saw the video, heard Pantaleo testify that he did not mean to use a chokehold, and chose not to bring charges in December 2014. The grand jury did not see intentional misconduct.\n\nBrooklyn-based FBI officials who investigated Garner's death oppose prosecuting Pantaleo and his fellow officers. Rather than heed them, Lynch is steering the case toward Washington-based staff in the Justice Department's civil rights division who want to prosecute the arresting officers.\n\nClinton gets every consideration; NYPD gets every doubt. Pantaleo's attorney Stuart London told the Times , \"In our system of justice, politics should never take the place of rule of law.\" That's a quaint thought, but in this Obama administration there is a clear double standard. The bar is so unreasonably high that there is no way prosecutors can establish if Clinton meant to break the law. However, the Justice Department has few qualms about presuming the worst about beat cops.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2016 CREATORS.COM\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "Remembering Sacrifice in New York Perhaps the city can once again become the world's greatest metropolis.\n\nI grew up in New York City, in Queens, in a neighborhood that few people outside of the borough have ever heard of: Middle Village.\n\nIn establishing shots in some episodes of The King of Queens , you can actually see the house I grew up in.\n\nMost of the thoroughfares in Queens have numbers, not names. The ones that run roughly north to south are called streets, places, or lanes, and the ones that run east to west are avenues, roads, drives, or courts. I grew up on 82nd Place, on a block bounded by 63rd Avenue and Penelope Avenue, which many of the locals pronounced to rhyme with \"cantaloupe.\"\n\nWhen I was growing up, one of my friends on the block was a boy called Peter Schmiemann. He was a nice kid from a nice family. He was one of five siblings. His older brother and sister were Matthew and Mary. He had a twin brother, Tommy. And the youngest of the five was Paul. Their mother, Marilyn, was kind. She was a friend of my mother's.\n\nAnd their dad was a cop, Hank.\n\nHank was one of two members of the NYPD who lived on our block. The other was Pete Conticelli, who lived two doors up from the Schmiemanns and directly across the street from us. He and my dad were good friends. He gave my dad one of his old badges to keep in his wallet so he could flash it to a police officer in case he got stopped for a busted headlight or something.\n\nPete and my dad used to talk a lot about how one day they would retire and get the hell out of New York. Pete actually did it. He, his wife, and their three kids moved to Socorro, New Mexico. By all accounts, he had a great life there.\n\nHank Schmiemann wasn't so lucky. Early on the morning of June 20, 1974, during the ignominious mayoralty of the lilliputian - in every sense - Abraham Beame, Lt. Henry Schmiemann was a few blocks from home on his way to work when he was shot to death in cold blood by a man with the most banal name you can imagine: John Smith.\n\nI also remember the funeral at Resurrection Ascension Church on Woodhaven Boulevard, where most of my Catholic friends went to school, and where on that beautiful sunny morning 1500 police officers lined up to pay tribute to their fallen colleague. As the New York Times reported at the time, the mourners included \"members of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and 18 other police departments from Long Island, Westchester County and New Jersey. The Suffolk County police provided a motorcycle escort of 36 officers, who later accompanied the cortege to Pinelawn National Cemetery, in Suffolk County, for burial.\"\n\nThe extraordinary spectacle of all those men in blue uniforms, lined up along the narrow street facing the church and standing at perfect attention with solemn looks on their faces, has never left me. Never before had I experienced such a moving sign of respect, of solidarity, and of perfect brotherhood.\n\nOne person who didn't bother to show up for the funeral was the mayor, Abe Beame, a despicable little party hack who in his campaign ads had emphasized his supposed support for the police.\n\nAnyway, all that happened 50 years ago. Half a century. For many, a lifetime. Since then, a lot of people on the old block have died or moved away. And many new people have moved in.\n\nBut some of the old neighbors remain and still remember. My sister, who after decades in California moved back into our family home after our father died, is one of them.\n\nAnother is Paul Schmiemann, Henry's youngest son, who now lives with his wife and children in the house in which he grew up. Middle Village, I should say, is a neighborhood - and I think this is probably very unusual in New York City - where houses aren't constantly being sold and resold, but are typically passed down from generation to generation. It's a neighborhood with an unusually strong sense of community - and an unusually strong sense of communal memory.\n\nSo it was an event of very special importance to many people on 82nd Place when, on Saturday, June 22, the block I grew up on was renamed - or, more correctly, given an extra name - in honor of our long-since fallen neighbor. It is now not only 82nd Place. It is also Lieutenant Henry O. Schmiemann Way.\n\nRenaming streets, or parts of them, after worthy New Yorkers is a time-honored tradition. The block of 50th Street in Manhattan between 8th Avenue and Broadway, for example, is also called Gershwin Way, after the songwriters George and Ira Gershwin. Now Henry Schmiemann, who dedicated his life to the safety and security of his fellow New Yorkers, has also been accorded this honor.\n\n82nd Street renamed for Lieutenant Henry O. Schmiemann (Carol J. Bawer for The American Spectator )\n\nOn Saturday there was a ceremony at the corner of 82nd Place and Penelope Avenue to mark the occasion. My old friend Peter delivered what my sister described to me as an eloquent tribute to his father. Another part of the event was especially meaningful. Paul, the youngest of Henry's five children, has a son whom he named after his father. Young Henry, it turns out, is a recent graduate of the Police Academy and a new member of the NYPD. At the ceremony honoring his grandfather, he was presented with a shield bearing his grandfather's shield number. (READ MORE from Bruce Bawer: Nostalgia Is Coming Back to New York City )\n\nThe New York Post quoted him as saying: \"I feel like I've been given a responsibility greater than what is behind the NYPD, which is immense.\" Isn't it moving, encouraging, and (yes) surprising to hear a fledgling police officer, in this day and age, talk like that? My old friend Peter told the Post: \"Our father left way too early, but we know that Henry is going to get the guidance and help from my father as he does his job.\"\n\nAnd given what New York is today - namely, something not terribly unlike the hellscape presided over by Abe Beame, in which Henry Schmiemann was gunned down senselessly in what, then as now, was one of the city's most tranquil quarters - young Henry will need all the guidance from his grandfather that he can get. May he have a long, happy, rewarding, and safe career in the noble service of what was once, and what may yet again, God willing, become the world's greatest metropolis.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "Jack Smith Shamelessly Withholds Evidence Smith's claim that Trump 'adamantly refused to do anything at all' is false to the point of slander.\n\nA lthough it is encouraging to see legal experts like Jonathan Turley and Andy McCarthy trash special counsel Jack Smith's most recent motion for its contortion of the law, a stronger and more tangible case can be made against Smith for his withholding and manipulation of critical evidence.\n\nWhat made the crowd \"angry\" in the first place was ... the reckless use of flash bangs, rubber bullets, and tear gas by the police.\n\nAccording to the DOJ's Justice Manual , a prosecutor has an \"obligation both to disclose exculpatory and impeachment information to criminal defendants and to seek a just result in every case.\" Smith shamelessly, blatantly, almost comically ignores DOJ policy.\n\nSmith's failure to disclose falls into three general categories. The first, and subtlest, is his distortion of the protestors' mood on January 6, 2021. The second, and more obvious, is his concealment of exculpatory statements made by President Donald Trump himself. The third, and more devious, is his manipulation of the day's timeline.\n\nAccording to Smith Trump lied about election fraud \"to inflame and motivate the large and angry crowd of his supporters to march to the Capitol and disrupt the certification proceeding.\" Throughout the document - four separate occasions - Smith insists the crowd was \"angry\" and that an \"angry\" president made them that way. Writes Smith, \"The overall impact of the defendant's speech - particularly in light of months of statements and Tweets falsely claiming election fraud ... was to fuel the crowd's anger.\" (READ MORE from Jack Cashill: Jack Smith and the Hijacking of January 6 )\n\nThe rallygoers I interviewed for my book Ashli: The Untold Story of the Women of January 6 , came away with a different impression. \"It was a happy, joyful day,\" Dr. Simone Gold told me. There were grandmas pushing baby carriages, groups literally singing \"Kumbaya,\" and people of every race mixing peacefully together. Said retired NYPD officer Sara Carpenter of the march to the Capitol, \"It was kids. It was dogs. It was wonderful.\"\n\nSaid Micki Witthoeft, the mother of Ashli Babbitt who was shot and killed that day by a Capitol Police officer, \"I can see in that video that [Ashli] was absolutely in her element, having a wonderful time.\" Husband Aaron Babbitt agreed. From her texts he concluded, \"She was having the best day of her life.\"\n\nA more obvious failing of Smith's motion is a failing he shares with the House January 6 committee and the major media, namely the conscious omission of Trump's exculpatory statements. If proof were needed of Smith's ill intent, consider his damning analysis of Trump's speech on the White House Ellipse:\n\nWhen the  defendant soon after told his supporters \"we're going to walk down to the Capitol,\" that they would \"never take back our country with weakness\" and that they had to \"show strength and to be strong,\" members of the crowd shouted, \"Invade the Capitol building!\" and \"Take the Capitol!\"\n\nThe deception here is as blatant as the Left's \"very fine people\" Charlottesville smear. Upon reading this paragraph, literally millions of Republicans - and maybe even a handful of media people - can tell you what Smith chose not to report, namely Trump's comment just seconds later:  \"I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.\" As to crowd members shouting, \"Invade the Capitol building!\" and \"Take the Capitol!\" Smith cites as his source a \"Rallygoer video.\" That's it. No names.\n\nSmith conceals two other significant communications. At 1:38, Trump tweeted, \"Please support our local police and law enforcement. They are truly on the side of our Country. Stay peaceful.\" At 2:13, Trump tweeted, \"I am asking for everyone at the Capitol to remain peaceful. No violence! Remember WE are the party of law and order.\"\n\nNot surprisingly, Smith makes no mention of Ashli Babbitt's death. The omission is glaring in that Smith mentions specifically the breaking of the window into which Babbitt, a 14-year Air Force veteran, leaped before being shot without warning by a Capitol Police officer. The window Smith can blame on Trump supporters. The shooting, well, that's best left unspoken.\n\nBabbitt presents another problem for Smith. Thanks to a law suit filed by Aaron Babbitt and Judicial Watch, we know her precise timeline that fateful day. Babbitt stayed to the end of Trump's speech on the Ellipse which wrapped up at about 1:10. The Ellipse is a good 45-minute walk from the Capitol. At 2 p.m., a random photographer took a picture of Babbitt with the Capitol looming majestically in the background. Babbitt was no laggard. Smith quotes a protestor who was interviewed by a news station at 2:11 as he was marching to the Capitol.\n\nAt 2:23 Babbitt entered the building. This is exactly 90 minutes after notorious agent provocateur Ray Epps and his crew first breached the perimeter of the Capitol grounds at 12:53. For the previous half hour or so, Epps had been shepherding people down Pennsylvania Avenue. \"We are going to the Capitol,\" he shouted. \"That's where our problems are.\"\n\nAfter three increasingly awkward years without arresting Epps, the DOJ slapped his wrist with a year's probation. Unconnected individuals who did less got as much as 20 years. One of the women I profile in Ashli got 4-1/2 years for helping break a window. Smith does not mention Epps or the other agent provocateurs seeded throughout the crowd. If they were instructed to shout incendiary comments such as \"Invade the Capitol\" or \"Hang Mike Pence,\" the defendant has no way of knowing.\n\nAt 1:06 p.m. the undertrained Capitol Police began lobbing munitions into a boisterous but peaceful crowd on the west terrace of the Capitol. These people were unmoved by Trump's speech for the simple reason they could not have heard it. Indeed, at 1:06 p.m. Trump had yet to deliver his alleged call to action - \"We fight. We fight like hell and if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore\" - and, I repeat, he was a 45-minute walk away.\n\nIt was not until 2:24 p.m. that Trump tweeted, \"Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution.\" Smith claims that the Secret Service was forced to evacuate Pence to a secure location exactly one minute later, falsely implying the tweet made the evacuation necessary.\n\nNo, what made evacuation necessary was that the Capitol building had been breached at 2:13. As the House January 6 Committee report notes, \"Just as the building was being breached, Vice President Pence and Speaker Pelosi were ushered off the Senate and House floors, respectively.\"\n\nWhat made the crowd \"angry\" in the first place was not Trump's tweet about Mike Pence, as Smith implies, but the reckless use of flash bangs, rubber bullets, and tear gas by the police. Indeed, at 1:28, 56-year-old father of five, Kevin Greeson, collapsed and soon died of cardiac arrest after a flash bang exploded in his face.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Smith does not quote either of the Trump tweets that called for peace. Nor does he describe their content. Rather, he says backhandedly, \"The defendant at least has an argument - though he issued the 2:38 p.m. and 3:13 p.m. tweets only after being harangued by his staff while he adamantly refused to do anything at all - that he was addressing a matter of public safety as President (the riot at the Capitol).\"\n\nTrump and his advisers did not see these tweets until 2023 when Twitter and Facebook unlocked his accounts. On February 17, 2023, FactCheck.org , no friend of Trump, grudgingly showed the two tweets. The first was posted at 1:38, the second at 2:13, each an hour before Smith and the January 6 committee claimed they were posted.\n\nYes, Trump could have been more emphatic in his call for order, but when at 4:17 p.m., he said on a posted video, \"You have to go home now. We have to have peace. We have to have law and order. We don't want anybody hurt,\" Twitter promptly applied a warning label. It read, \"The claim of election fraud is disputed, and this tweet can't be replied to, Retweeted, or liked due to a risk of violence.\" Facebook blocked the post as well.\n\nCensorship has consequences. Fifteen or so minutes after Trump's video was blocked, the Metropolitan PD shoved 34-year-old Rosanne Boyland and other protestors down a flight of stairs. When Boyland was pulled out from the pile unconscious, stick-wielding policewoman Lila Morris struck her repeatedly over the head. Boyland died soon afterwards, and Morris went to the Super Bowl to be honored for her heroism.\n\nAs they say, the difference between the New York Times and the old Soviet Pravda , is that Pravda readers knew they were being lied to. Smith seems to have figured this out.\n\nJack Cashill's book, Ashli: The Untold Story of the Women of January 6 , is available in all formats.\n\nEmail (required) *\n\nFirst Name\n\nLast Name\n\nExample: Yes, I would like to receive emails from The American Spectator | USA News and Politics.

      "text": "Controversial Mosque's Facebook Video on Women Belies Progressive Claims\n\nA local Brooklyn mosque with a checkered history and once surveilled by the NYPD continues to promote radical content online.\n\nAli Abdul-Karim Judan, mosque spokesman and head of security for At-Taqwa mosque in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, posted a video on Facebook Live titled \"Are Muslim Women Who Are Covered According to What Allah Has Legislated in the Qur'an and Women Who Are Not Judged Equally!\"\n\nIn the video, Karim argues that women who do not fully cover their bodies and who show \"any indication\" of their form are \"cursed,\" \"disobedient,\" and \"deviant.\" This includes \"any woman who wears perfume in public\" and members of the trans community.\n\n\"Allah cursed the man who wears women's clothes and the woman who wears men's clothes,\" says Karim.\n\nPreaching to a Facebook audience of over 5,000 followers, Karim claims that God's laws assign men and women \"different roles\" and that men are the designated \"maintainer\" of women.\n\nHe discusses the Islamic concept of Tabarraj, or \"beautification,\" which he argues is \"forbidden\" and \"so abhorrent that it is associated with fornication, stealing, and all other sins.\"\n\nKarim concludes that Allah does not judge equally women who are dressed in \"clothes of righteousness\" and those who are not, calling the issue of women's dress a \"crisis\" in society that must be \"managed.\"\n\nDespite its association with supposedly \"progressive\" Islamic organizations such as the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the Muslim American Society (MAS), and the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA), the At-Taqwa mosque has revealed itself to be an illiberal institution that espouses demeaning views towards women and the transgender community.\n\nIt is worth noting that CAIR, a prominent Islamic organization that emphasizes an alliance with progressive groups, claims to stand for women's rights and uniformly endorses Democratic candidates in local, state, and federal elections, has a close relationship with At-Taqwa.\n\nThe mosque's leading Imam, Siraj Wahhaj, is a regularly featured speaker at CAIR's annual banquets and is a former member of its advisory board. As recently as 2017, Wahhaj, who previously served as vice president of ISNA, headlined the group's annual conference. Wahhaj has called homosexuality a \"disease\" that is punishable by death and declared in 1992 that he would set fire to a proposed mosque in Toronto that was tolerant of the LGBT community. Wahhaj previously defended stoning and other forms of punitive violence and on several occasions has come to the defense of convicted terrorists, including Omar Abdel-Rahman, otherwise known as the \"Blind Sheikh,\" who masterminded the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and inspired dozens of other terrorist plots.\n\nWahhaj served as a character witness for Rahman during the trial and has called the attacks a conspiracy against Muslims staged by the U.S. government. He converted to Islam under the guidance of notorious anti-Semite and homophobe Louis Farrakhan. In the '90s, he was outspoken in his support of Sharia law, once declaring in a sermon, \"I want the Sharia.\" He is also on record as saying, \"Politics are a weapon to use in the cause of Islam ... If only Muslims were clever politically, they could take over the United States and replace its constitutional government with a caliphate.\" Stephen Schwartz, executive director of the Center for Islamic Pluralism, called Wahhaj a \"hatemonger\" and the \"No. 1 advocate of radical Islamic ideology among African-Americans.\" In 2008, some 175 pieces of literature Wahhaj had written on Islam were discovered in U.S. prison libraries.\n\nThe At-Taqwa mosque was itself the subject of a controversial surveillance program by the NYPD in 2013. The NYPD defended the program by claiming the mosque had reportedly raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for terrorist organizations and was believed to have a gun club with illegally procured weapons.\n\nAs head of security, Karim hosts self-defense workshops on a weekly basis and posts videos of them on Facebook. Some of these workshops have offered militaristic training and included instructions on how to disarm law enforcement officers. Several of Karim's participants have referred to themselves as \"jihad warriors.\" One of them, Farooque Ahmed, pled guilty to plotting an attack on the Washington D.C. Metro.\n\nMost recently, in 2018, Wahhaj's son, a devout Muslim and polygamist, along with four of his relatives, were charged with operating a terrorist training camp for children. The scandal involved a New Mexico compound raided by law enforcement where, inside, Wahhaj's toddler son (Siraj Wahhaj's grandson) was found dead, alongside 11 malnourished children and a large cache of firearms. According to court papers , the children were being trained to attack \"teachers, military, law enforcement, and financial institutions.\"\n\nIn yet another Facebook Live post , Karim called the entire compound event \"anti-Muslim propaganda.\"\n\nBoth CAIR and MAS released statements of solidarity with the Wahhaj family in response to the incident.\n\nThe misogyny, militarism, and promotion of theocracy embraced by the At-Taqwa mosque are hardly progressive values. This, then, casts doubt on the professed liberalism of CAIR, MAS, ISNA, and other groups that come to the defense of At-Taqwa and its Imams.\n\nKarys Rhea a writer and musician living in Brooklyn.

      "text": "Palestinian Man Storms Manhattan Synagogue, Cursing in Arabic\n\nA male in his twenties, identifying himself as Palestinian , jumped over a seat barrier and charged the stage at the Lincoln Square Synagogue in Manhattan Thursday evening during an event featuring Israeli minorities voicing support for the Jewish state, according to attendees.\n\nIn video obtained by the Haym Salomon Center showing the final few seconds of the incident, the alleged assailant can be heard cursing in Arabic and then backing off as he approaches the stage and security overwhelms him.\n\n\"I was scared and shocked when I heard this man shouting, cursing and jumping over seats as he rushed toward the stage,\" explained Jonathan Elkhoury. \"I immediately saw Mohammad Kabiya running to stand in front and protect Bassem [Eid] in order to make sure no one would come close and harm him.\"\n\nElkoury, Kabiya and Eid are Christian, Muslim-Bedouin and Muslim-Palestinian, respectively, who have served in the Israel Defense Forces and are currently on a U.S. speaking tour with the organization Reservists on Duty (RoD). For the past two weeks, these men, joined by Dema Taya, an Arab-Israeli Muslim woman who also served in the IDF, have traveled to 12 different cities, speaking about being minorities in Israel. ( Corrrection, Nov. 1 : Dema Taya and Bassem Eid did not serve in the IDF. They are Arab-Israelis who volunteer their time to express support for Israel.)\n\nAccording to Elkhoury, the individual who charged the speakers was cursing in Arabic, \"calling us 'rats who sold our souls' and 'Arab-Jewish' (a pejorative), and calling our mothers prostitutes.\"\n\nApproximately ten protesters were removed by security and escorted off the premises by New York City police. Witnesses claim that an anti-terrorism unit also arrived on the scene, which NYPD will neither confirm nor deny.\n\nIn an email to the Haym Salomon Center, NYPD would say only that \"there was a 911 call for an assault in progress. When police arrived, they determined that there was a dispute between two individuals. A complaint report for harassment was taken at the scene.\"\n\nAmit Deri, founder of RoD, expressed dismay that the protesters, especially the individual who charged the stage, were not arrested.\n\n\"This was a private event, held in a private facility. These people didn't want to engage in any dialogue, they just wanted to disrupt our event and intimidate the attendees. Tonight, these people are free to interrupt or even shut down any other pro-Israel speakers or Jewish events. I don't understand why these anti-Semites are free.\"\n\nDeri added:\n\n\"Nobody will deter us from speaking the truth about Israel. Those who try to shut us down will be met with a resistance and determination they cannot fathom. We have truth on our side, and that is what scares them the most.\"\n\nOn Tuesday night a woman was arrested at the University of Minnesota for trying to shut down an RoD event sponsored by a student group.\n\nIn May, at the University of California, Irvine, IDF reservists speaking on behalf of RoD had to be escorted out by police following a violent protest by anti-Israel students. The Jewish, Christian, and Muslim IDF delegation documented the violence on video, using smartphone cameras. This ultimately led to the anti-Israel group Students for Justice in Palestine being placed on disciplinary probation for two academic years.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

Much of the focus has been on the restructuring of Middle Eastern Studies in general, not just the department.

      "text": "Report: NYPD Applicant Numbers Drop 55 Percent in Democrat-Run NYC\n\nThe number of candidates testing to become New York City Police Department (NYPD) officers has reportedly dwindled in recent years, leaving the Democrat-run city scrambling to fill those positions.\n\nThe number of candidates has shrunk over the past eight years, the New York Post reported on Saturday. In 2017, the number of prospective officers was 18,000 but has decreased to 8,000.\n\nThat is a 55 percent drop, according to data from the union known as the Police Benevolent Association.\n\nA seasoned Brooklyn officer told the outlet that officers are telling people not to take the job because \"You'll be worked to the bone, attacked by perps and politicians and hammered with nonsense complaints and ticky-tack discipline.\"\n\nAccording to the NYPD's website, the hiring process requires candidates to take a written entrance exam, undergo a medical exam, take written and oral psychological exams, undergo a background character investigation, and also take a physical test to prove they are fit enough to perform their duties.\n\nIn 2023, a report said more of the city's officers were continuing to leave the force in droves as crime plagued their communities.\n\nThe recent Post article continued:\n\nMayor Adams pledged in November to bring on 1,600 new cops in 2025 - but the city has been having trouble finding viable candidates, a union spokesman said.\n\nEven if the city gets to 800 Academy cadets - candidates who pass the test and meet all the other mental and physical benchmarks - by its Jan. 29 target, the candidate pool will be shallow as it comes time to hire the second class of 800 in April, the union said.\n\nThe outlet also noted that New York's bail reform has caused them to look at other careers because officers often encounter the same suspects committing crimes, who end up being quickly released. Many of those individuals are apparently migrants who have flooded the city.\n\nAs crime bears down on residents, \"Applications for permits to carry guns have spiked in both New York City and New Jersey since the U.S. Supreme Court ordered New York and other states with strict regulations to make it easier for people to arm themselves in the summer of 2022,\" the Gothamist reported in August.\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

So far in his second term there are an estimated 126 lawsuits and legal challenges filed against his policies and actions,\" Faulkner said. \"In his first term there were 64 nationwide injunctions filed against his administration. That's double the number of injunctions filed during [George W.] Bush, Obama and Biden admins combined. And there have only been 127 total since 1963. So, 126 in what has it been, 57 days?

This is something that has happened on both sides but it is becoming much, much, more problematic and common on the left versus Donald Trump.\"\n\nWATCH:\n\nUnited States District Judge James Boasberg of the District of Columbia issued an injunction Saturday ordering the Trump administration to turn two planes carrying members of the Tren de Aragua (TdA) gang to El Salvador around after President Donald Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act to speed up deportations of foreign gangbangers from the United States. Mauro, who is also an attorney, said that Boasberg's order was part of a flood of \"universal injunctions\" that could trigger involvement by the Supreme Court.\n\nTrump issued several executive orders to address illegal immigration upon taking office Jan. 20, including one that designated Mexican drug cartels, TdA and MS-13 as foreign terrorist organizations. Mauro told Faulkner the case could end up at the Supreme Court.\n\n\"In Trump v. Hawaii in the first term, that was the Muslim ban that wasn't a Muslim ban, this issue kind of came up on a sidelight. Justice Thomas said very specifically, we have to get this up to the court. We have to resolve this,\" Mauro said, referencing the Supreme Court's decision on Trump's first-term travel ban from several countries. \"They are signaling, as has Gorsuch and as has Roberts a little bit, you rarely get the court saying get this to us, we want to fix it, and so in a weird way, the judge has done them a favor. This is right - the facts are good for the Trump Administration. This judge has stopped it. It is very, very, right to get it expedited up to SCOTUS and get rid of this once and for all or at least amend it.\"\n\nIn reply, Faulkner questioned how the judge could claim he had the authority to order the planes to turn around after they left U.S. airspace to remove the deported gangsters from the country. (RELATED: 'Citizens Are Different': Scott Jennings Shuts Down Dem Rep's Fearmongering About Deportations)\n\n\"If they were off U.S. territory, which obviously, they were in the air, and out of U.S. airspace over international waters, how in the world does this judge - and he didn't do it contemporaneously - it was like, 30 minutes into... I don't know, maybe somebody tipped him off and he went, oh my goodness, maybe there is something I can sign for this. How does he have standing?\" Faulkner asked.\n\n\"It gets to the point of, it really gets down to almost nomenclature. The DOJ is saying the minute the plane left American airspace, the removal occurred right there,\" Mauro replied. \"You are talking about something that was moot. They have already been removed, what are you talking about, it is already done. He is saying my authority doesn't stop at the waterline, and here is the thing that bothers me and why I think he is over his skis. Because the plane was over the Yucatan Peninsula. He hasn't done no inquiry as to whether or not the plane had fuel to turn around. The plane, remember, we have cut this deal to land in Venezuela or Honduras.\"\n\nTdA is a violent gang whose members have allegedly been involved in the takeover of apartment complexes in Aurora, Colorado , as well as kidnapping and murder .\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Santiago/Getty Images)\n\nNew York Police Department (NYPD) Commissioner Edward Caban resigned Thursday in light of an investigation into corruption involving his twin brother's alleged dealings with nightclubs, NBC news reported.\n\nCaban, who was appointed by New York City Mayor Eric Adams in 2023, announced his resignation via email, according to NBC News. Federal investigators seized Caban's phone last week as part of an investigation into whether his twin James Caban, a nightclub security business owner, profited off his brother's influence. (RELATED: Eric Adams Declares Support For Rollback Of NYC's Sanctuary City Laws)\n\n\"The news around recent developments has created a distraction for our department, and I am unwilling to let my attention be on anything other than our important work, or the safety of the men and women of the NYPD,\" Caban said in an email obtained by NBC News. \"I hold immense respect and gratitude for the brave officers who serve this department, and the NYPD deserves someone who can solely focus on protecting and serving New York City, which is why - for the good of this city and this department - I have made the difficult decision to resign as police commissioner.\"\n\nEdward A. Caban speaks during a press conference on the 2023 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade at Inflation Eve at American Museum of Natural History on November 22, 2023 in New York City. (Photo by Taylor Hill/Getty Images)\n\nThe investigation is specifically looking into whether nightclubs received special treatment from the NYPD, and if James Caban was being paid to act as a liaison to the department for the clubs, sources told NBC News. Edward Caban's attorneys, Russell Capone and Rebekah Donaleski, said he will fully cooperate with the investigation involving his brother.\n\n\"We have been informed by the government that he is not a target of any investigation being conducted by the Southern District of New York, and he expects to cooperate fully with the government,\" the attorneys told NBC News.\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams is also under investigation for allegedly taking money from the Turkish government for his campaign. The Federal Bureau of Investigation raided the homes of two of his aides, First Deputy Mayor Sheena Wright and Deputy Mayor for Public Safety Phil Banks, but neither have been charged with a crime as of yet.\n\nThe NYPD did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation's request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "Top NYPD Chief Says City's Sanctuary Policies Should Be Vaporized After Migrant Allegedly Raped Woman At Knifepoint\n\nJohn Moore/Getty Images\n\nThe New York City Police Department's chief of patrol is demanding the city roll back its sanctuary policies in the wake of another alleged migrant crime.\n\nA homeless migrant in Brooklyn was arrested for allegedly raping a woman on Sunday at knifepoint while his migrant accomplice allegedly beat a man when he attempted to intervene, according to CBS News. At least one of the migrants allegedly involved had been previously arrested for a prior sexual assault and was released back into the public, prompting outcry from New York City leadership about the sanctuary laws allowing criminal illegal migrants to avoid deportation. (RELATED: NYC Mayor Says Migrants Can Help Lifeguard Shortage Because They're 'Excellent Swimmers')\n\n\"When that case was adjudicated, his next step should've been on a bus or a plane and removed from our city,\" NYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell stated on Tuesday, referring to the conclusion of the migrant's prior criminal proceedings, according to CBS News.\n\n\"Most of them are here for the American dream, but there's a small portion that are not,\" Chell said to CBS News. \"We're just looking for local government to maybe make that adjustment to those laws to really - at the end of the day, this all falls under the banner of keeping people safe.\"\n\nNEW YORK, NEW YORK - NOVEMBER 11: New York Mayor Eric Adams participates in the annual Veterans Day Parade on November 11, 2023 in New York City. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)\n\nThe case involves David Davon-Bonilla, a Nicaraguan migrant who crossed into the U.S. at Eagle Pass, Texas, in December 2022 and eventually made his way to New York City, according to ABC7. Davon-Bonilla sexually assaulted a woman in April, and after pleading guilty, he was released from Rikers Island prison on June 24.\n\nDavon-Bonilla was arraigned Monday night and is being held without bail for allegedly raping the woman, according to ABC7.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) did not immediately confirm Davon-Bonilla's immigration status when reached for comment from the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nSanctuary laws largely prohibit local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration authorities, which typically means they cannot inform deportation officers when a criminal migrant is in their custody or when that migrant is being released back into the public. Former Mayor Bill de Blasio signed into law sanctuary legislation in 2014 limiting the New York Police Department's ability to work with ICE, and he doubled down on this policy two years later.\n\nIn the wake of numerous high-profile crimes allegedly committed by illegal migrants, more New York City politicians - including Democrats - are calling for these policies to be rolled back.\n\n\"Laws do not allow us to coordinate with ICE. That's the law,\" Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat, said in response to the latest rape case, according to CBS News.\n\n\"And, you know I'm not happy about that,\" Adams continued. \"And I think [Davon-Bonilla is] the poster child of what's wrong with not doing that coordination.\"\n\nHowever, all efforts to actually wind back these sanctuary laws have so far fallen flat.\n\nThe Common Sense Caucus, a coalition of moderate Republican and Democratic members of the New York City Council, introduced legislation in June that would allow city police to more freely work with ICE agents, but in a city council dominated by liberal Democrats, the bill has not been able to move forward.\n\nMembers of the Common Sense Caucus had pinned their hopes on allowing New York City voters to directly vote on the issue, with the recently-established Charter Revision Commission given the authority to decide what issues city residents would be allowed to vote on in the November elections. However, these hopes were sunk once the commission released its report last month, announcing that there would be no referendum on the city's sanctuary laws.\n\nOver 208,000 migrants have sought refuge in New York City since the nationwide immigration crisis began, fomenting an \"explosion\" in the city's shelter population and taxpayer expenditures, the commission's own report acknowledges. City officials expect t o hash out more than $12 billion managing the crisis through 2025.\n\nThe asylum crisis forced Adams to declare 5% budget cuts in September for government programs and services in order to pay for migrant housing and other services, and last year he bemoaned that the city was reaching a \"breaking point\" from the sheer volume of migrants.\n\nNYC's sanctuary laws have become more controversial following a strong of illegal migrant crimes, such as when a group allegedly went on a shopping spree and beat down an NYPD officer, another illegal migrant allegedly fired at two NYPD cops during a foot pursuit or the alleged rape of a 13-year-old girl at knifepoint by another illegal migrant.\n\nOne Democrat member of the Common Sense Caucus on Wednesday ripped city officials for failing to take action.\n\n\"Instead of being turned over to ICE after being arrested, convicted, and sentenced, this sicko was released back onto the streets, only to commit the same vile sexual assault again,\" Council Member Robert Holden said in a press release. \"This is a direct result of City Hall's refusal to act and work with ICE to keep our communities safe, leaving us vulnerable to those who should have been deported.\"\n\n\"We already have enough criminals in this city - why should we continue importing more?\" Holden continued. \"The madness in this city must end.\"\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Officials also confirmed that Mata entered the U.S. illegally last year through Eagle Pass, Texas. (RELATED: Illegal Immigrant Accused Of Murdering Laken Riley Pleads Not Guilty)\n\n\"What we know is that the shooter here, he entered the country from Venezuela. He entered through Eagle Pass, Texas, back in July of 2023,\" Chief of Detectives, Joe Kenny, said during a press conference on Monday.\n\n\"We know that he entered the country illegally. The patterns that we're looking at currently in Queens that he's involved with [phone snatches] and instances where a woman was attacked, her credit card was stolen, and eventually used in a Queens smoke shop,\" Kenny continued.\n\nNew York City Police Department (NYPD) officers patrol on motorcycles ahead of the arrival of US President Joe Biden's motorcade in New York City on February 26, 2024. Biden is in New York to attend a campaign event. (Photo by Charly TRIBALLEAU / AFP) (Photo by CHARLY TRIBALLEAU/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe shooting took place early Sunday in the Elmhurst neighborhood of Queens, according to the authorities. Two officers attempted to pull over a suspect on a moped driving the wrong way when the suspect, alleged to be Mata, fled on foot.\n\nDuring the foot chase, the suspect fired multiple rounds at the officers, who then returned fire.\n\n\"One officer was shot in the front of his bullet resistant vest. The other officer was shot in his leg,\" Police Commissioner Edward Caban said.\n\nBoth officers were taken to Elmhurst Hospital and said to be in \"stable condition.\" Mata was shot in the right ankle and taken to New York Presbyterian Queens by medical personnel.\n\nKenny also confirmed that Mata was living in the Landing Family Shelter, a former Courtyard Marriott Hotel that is currently being used to house migrants in the city. Police also noted that the gun Mata allegedly used was not legally owned.\n\nPolice suspect Mata is involved in a network of other motorized bike riders who are traversing the city and committing other crimes, such as shootings and robberies.\n\n\"Just to paint you a quick picture of how many of these crimes are being committed. January 1st to June 1st, 2022, zero robbery patterns involving motorized scooters or motorcycles,\" Kenny said.\n\n\"The same time period, 2023, 20 robbery patterns. Year to date so far this year, January 1st to June 1st, 2024, we have over 80 robbery patterns citywide involving incidents where the perpetrators are riding motorized scooters or motorcycles,\" he explained.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement did not immediately confirm Mata's legal status to the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

He had been apprehended by Border Patrol after unlawfully entering the U.S. near Eagle Pass, Texas, in July 2023. (RELATED: NYC Mayor Says Migrants Can Help Lifeguard Shortage Because They're 'Excellent Swimmers')\n\nBorder Patrol had released Castro-Mata on his own recognizance, and a Department of Justice judge dismissed his immigration case on May 6, ICE confirmed.\n\nThe shooting occurred when two officers attempted to pull over a suspect, alleged to be Castro-Mata, driving a moped in the wrong direction early Monday morning in Queens, city officials said. The suspect attempted to flee on foot and, amid the chase, fired multiple rounds at the officers, hitting one officer in his bullet-resistant vest and the other officer in the leg.\n\nNEW YORK, NY - JUNE 5: Pedestrians cross an intersection near concrete barriers, placed by the New York City Police Department to prevent vehicles from driving onto the sidewalks in Times Square June 5, 2017 in New York City. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\n\nBoth officers are in stable condition.\n\nCastro-Mata is currently being held in NYPD custody, ICE confirmed. The agency also noted that they have lodged a detainer request for him.\n\nThe Venezuelan national had been living in the Landing Family Shelter, which is being used to house migrants in the area, Chief of Detectives Joe Kenny said during a press conference Monday. NYPD suspects he is part of a larger network of motorized bike riders that are orchestrating crime sprees across the city.\n\n\"Just to paint you a quick picture of how many of these crimes are being committed. January 1st to June 1st, 2022, zero robbery patterns involving motorized scooters or motorcycles,\" Chief of Detectives, Joe Kenny, said Monday.\n\n\"The same time period, 2023, 20 robbery patterns. Year to date so far this year, January 1st to June 1st, 2024, we have over 80 robbery patterns citywide involving incidents where the perpetrators are riding motorized scooters or motorcycles,\" he said.\n\nThe illegal immigration crisis has hit New York City particularly hard, prompting Mayor Eric Adams to sour on the city's sanctuary policies.\n\nThe Big Apple has accepted around 160,000 asylum seekers since April 2022, forcing leaders to make substantial budget cuts in order to deal with the burden. Adams announced 5% budget cuts in September for all government programs and services in order to pay for the incoming illegal immigrants taking refuge in the city, and said in August the city was reaching a \"breaking point\" from the sheer volume of migrants.\n\nAdams is now reportedly in talks with ICE on rolling back some of the city's sanctuary laws, enabling federal immigration authorities to more easily apprehend criminal illegal aliens.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

And so that change in tactics combined with the presence of known individuals on campus in the leadup to what happened in Hamilton Hall is why we had a real elevated concern around public safety.\"\n\nWeiner's comments Wednesday corroborate Tuesday night comments from Eric Adams. \"I have been saying for days, if not weeks now, that which should have been a peaceful protest ... it has basically been co-opted by professional outside agitators,\" Adams said Tuesday night.\n\nThe NYPD made the arrests after protestors overtook Columbia's Hamilton Hall early Tuesday morning. Columbia released a statement informing students and the public that the arrests came at the request of the school. (RELATED: Watch Columbia Protester's Entire Worldview Collapse In Seconds From A Few Simple Questions)\n\n\"A little after 9 p.m. this evening, the NYPD arrived on campus at the University's request. This decision was made to restore safety and order to our community,\" the statement read.\n\nThe decision to call NYPD marks the second time the University has done so in recent weeks. Following the first instance, where NYPD detained protestors and cleared the campus of tents that had been erected by Pro-Palestine agitators. The incident potentially spurned the nationwide eruption of protests on campuses across the country as Columbia's protestors responded with increased presence on campus in the following days.\n\nTRENDING\n\n©2025 The Daily Caller, Inc.\n\nThe Daily Caller | 1775 Eye Street NW | Suite 1150-290 | Washington, DC 20006\n\nSubscription Type\n\nUnlimited digital access to The Daily Caller\n\nPremium Article: Subscribe for $1 to read the rest.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nAlready have an account?

      "text": "I Was An NYPD Officer In The 80s. Here's How We Strategically Lowered Crime Rates In Less Than A Decade.\n\nOn a summer day in 1986, in need of a cigarette, I emerged from the 59 th Street subway station in Brooklyn with my K-9 partner, Sarge. I was a 24-year-old police officer with four years experience under my belt.\n\nStanding on the corner of Fourth Avenue was another young cop covering a foot post. He gestured to several males loitering on a stoop down the block and warned me not to wander too close. \"It's a crack house,\" he said. I was shocked that a police officer would think such a thing, let alone say it out loud. \" We're the police,\" I responded . \"If we don't walk down there who the hell will?\" His answer was simple: \"Not me.\" As I watched him walk away, I couldn't help but feel angry.\n\nI marched down the block with Sarge and stood in front of the house. By the time I finished my cigarette, the crack slingers and their corner boys had slithered away.\n\nBut that moment stuck with me. I didn't understand the cop's attitude then, but I get it now. He had no leadership, direction, or sense of mission. The city was on the cusp of a crack epidemic that would claim the lives of 1,500 people that year in the five boroughs.\n\nBy 1988, the number of murders climbed toward 2,000 - a far cry from the 400 or so homicides the city is on pace for this year. The streets were in chaos. Time's Square was infested with crack dealers, crooks, and smut shops. Wolf packs of young thugs rampaged through the city streets and subways, robbing tourists and terrorizing residents.\n\nLuxury Hotels were turned into \"homeless\" shelters and Section 8 housing. The subways were over-run with vagrants, and the mentally ill were living all over the streets. Graffiti was everywhere. Squeegee men controlled intersections at the bridges entering the city. The project playgrounds and street corners belonged to the drug dealers. It seemed hopeless and none of the politicians or police brass seemed to have a plan to stop it. Sound familiar?\n\nAround that time, in a Transit Police satellite office on Vesey Street in lower Manhattan, a brilliant, tough, fearless Detective Lieutenant named Jack Maple was creating a Unit called the Repeat Offender Robbery Strike Force (RORSF) that would revolutionize crime fighting in the city and across the country. Maple's idea was to map crime, identify robbery patterns in the transit system, and then proactively allocate resources to those specific areas to catch robbers in the act or fleeing from the scene. The results were astounding.\n\nIn three short years, Wolf Pack Robberies (robberies involving four or more suspects) went from 1,200 a year in the subway to less than 200. Token Booth robberies, the subway version of a bank robbery, went from 120 a year to 12. Across the board, violent crime in the subways fell in ways never imagined. It was the birth of a crime-fighting tool called COMPSTAT.\n\nWhen Rudy Giuliani was elected the 107 th mayor in 1994, Transit Police Chief William Bratton and Maple took their concept and the results to City Hall. Giuliani was so impressed, he made Bratton the NYPD's next police commissioner and Maple his right hand man as deputy commissioner of operations.\n\nTogether they would implement COMPSTAT across the NYPD and transform a reactionary force of 38,000 cops into a proactive army with a specific mission to attack high crime areas with a zero tolerance crime policy intent on restoring a sense of law and order to the streets. The result was violent criminals being taken off the streets in record numbers and tens of thousands of lives being saved.\n\nBy 2002, the year I retired from the NYPD, the murder rate along with most other major crime would crater almost 70% across the board. By 2017, murders had dropped below 300 citywide, a number not seen since 1951. New York had become the safest big city in the country.\n\nThe violence we saw back in the 80s and 90s is eerily similar to what we see happening today. Crime is up dramatically in 76 of New York City's 77 precincts, except this time the violence is not fueled by drug dealers slinging crack. It's fueled by a corrupt and irresponsible media, and progressive politicians slinging anti-police rhetoric. Meanwhile, policies are enacted that handcuff officers from enforcing the law, and thousands of violent criminals are released back into our most vulnerable neighborhoods.\n\nRudy Giuliani, a Republican who was tough on crime, was elected mayor in a navy blue state. Regardless of what people may say about him today, he worked 20 hours a day, seven days a week to clean up the city. He treated the crack epidemic and violent crime like a crisis. He put criminals on notice, making it clear the city would no longer tolerate chaos and disorder on the streets. He gave the police department a clear mission, and then surrounded himself with competent people to help him execute it.\n\nEight months into his administration, Mayor Eric Adams has failed to do anything beyond offering a lot of tough talk. He spends too much time partying in the Hamptons and rubbing elbows with celebrities in NYC nightclubs and largely ignores a burgeoning crisis that threatens to cripple the city for years to come. His answer to violent crime is to prohibit police officers from congregating in public. And as the situation spirals out of control, where is Adams' Police Commissioner Keechant Sewell? At times, it's as if Adams is trying to be the mayor and police commissioner. He is failing miserably at both.\n\nIt's time for the commissioner to step down. She is clearly not up to the task. Running the NYPD is the most coveted and difficult job in policing. When Adams publicly announced he would not consider anyone but a woman as his police commissioner, a blatant act of discrimination, he eliminated a large pool of more qualified and experienced candidates from many different backgrounds.\n\nReal change starts with you, the citizen. You must not sit back in fear, ignorance, or indifference while people are being attacked with hatchets at ATMs or shoved onto the subway tracks, and children are being struck down in a hail of gunfire. You have to get up off the couch, go to your churches, community, and school board meetings, take the gloves off, and demand change.\n\nCall out your precinct captains, district attorneys, and political leaders about your failing schools, out of control crime, and insane policies like bail reform. Speak out against defunding the police. The murders of young black and brown men in inner city neighborhoods can no longer be accepted as normal and should be dealt with as if it were happening on the ritzy Upper East Side of Manhattan. Get involved. Vote the bums out who have been promising you rainbows and unicorns and giving you nothing but substandard education, crime, and poverty.\n\nThe Police Benevolent Association (PBA) has done a good job of sticking up for its membership, but more needs to be done. The safety of the rank and file is non-negotiable. Right now they cannot safely do their jobs. The union needs to fight. Expose these moronic politicians and their insane policies on TV, podcasts, and on social media every day. Be relentless. Let people hear stories from victims and their families. Police officers on the street have to win back the hearts and minds of the people in the inner city by targeting criminals and not the hard working families who are the real victims of the bail reform, anti-police, defund crowd. They have to know we're on their side.\n\nAs police officers, we swear an oath to protect and serve. I understand the reluctance to do that in today's climate. But it's our job. We can't stand by while elected officials make a mockery of us. Police officers can't retreat from a bucket of water being poured over their heads or run away when bricks or fireworks are fired at their police cars. We can't be afraid to do our jobs.\n\nThe PBA needs to use its political clout and every resource available to take the handcuffs off of our officers. COMPSTAT works, but not without the backing of city politicians, police brass, and the public.\n\nWe need serious, courageous leadership in the city and state government to take the streets back from criminals and return them to hard working, law-abiding citizens. Real change can happen and I have witnessed it before. It won't be easy and it won't happen overnight. I saw it with my own eyes.\n\nIt all starts with you at the ballot box.\n\nJohn Dove is a retired NYPD Detective Lieutenant and the former co-executive producer of CSI-NY starring Gary Sinise.\n\nThe views expressed in this piece are those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of The Daily Wire.\n\nContinue reading this exclusive article and join the conversation, plus watch free videos on DW+\n\nAlready a member?

The 25-year-old has since been controversially charged with second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide in Neely's death and is facing up to 19 years behind bars if convicted on both counts.\n\nIt was revealed in court that Neely was still alive when officers arrived on the scene and that he was administered Narcan, a drug used to reverse opioid overdoses. Moreover, jurors learned that, as a safety precaution, officers did not give Neely mouth-to-mouth because Neely looked dirty and disease-ridden.\n\n\"He was an apparent drug user and he was very dirty,\" NYPD Sgt. Carl Johnson testified, according to the New York Post. \"I didn't want my officers to put their lips on his mouth. They could get hepatitis or AIDS ... chest compressions would be enough to get him awake.\"\n\nMATT WALSH'S 'AM I RACIST?' NOW STREAMING ON DAILYWIRE+\n\nPressed by Penny's attorney Thomas Kenniff about why only chest compressions were administered, Johnson reportedly said he \"didn't have a mask to wear to protect himself from potentially being infected by any 'number of diseases,'\" a Daily Mail report said .\n\n\"There's a certain line where you have to protect your officer,\" Johnson told the court. \"Look at 9/11. I wouldn't want one of my officers getting sick from this.\"\n\nIf Neely did wake up, the sergeant explained, \"he would have been vomiting.\"\n\n\"I didn't want my officers to do that,\" Johnson said. \"He was filthy. He looked like a homeless individual. You have to protect your officer. I wouldn't want my officer to get sick if the person throws up.\"\n\nNotably, a synthetic cannabinoid called K2 was found in Neely's system, according to a toxicology report ordered by the prosecution.\n\nKenniff, Penny's attorney, spoke to The Daily Wire last month and said this would likely be disclosed by the state.\n\n\"I don't think it would be a smart tactical move for the prosecution to try to hide it,\" Kenniff said. \"So I think it's coming out one way or another. I think it's gonna come out through the government's case, but certainly, that is going to be part of what the defense will point to [as one of] many other factors to describe the [circumstances].\"\n\n\"It's very important that the jury be aware of that drug in Mr. Neely's system, and the effects of that drug, because it affects behaviors, particularly when Mr. Neely was likely in a psychotic episode to begin with, which he has a history of,\" the attorney added. \"It's going to affect how threatening Neely appeared.\"\n\nUse of K2, sometimes referred to a \"spice,\" has been linked to psychosis.\n\nRelated: EXCLUSIVE: Daniel Penny's Lawyer Talks Strategy Ahead Of Chokehold Death Case\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

Wendy!!\" according to The New York Post . The New York Police Department reportedly visited Williams on Monday morning \"to determine if, as Wendy says, she's effectively being held prisoner,\" per TMZ . She was transported to Lenox Hill Hospital and spent time with a psychiatrist there.\n\nA source told the outlet that Williams aced the capacity test, getting all ten questions correct.\n\nThis latest incident comes after the celeb has been making headlines for months as she fights to be freed from a legal guardianship involving both her health and finances that's been in place since 2022. Williams has been trying to publicize the case, insisting that the guardianship is unnecessary.\n\n\"I am not cognitively impaired but I feel like I am in prison,\" Williams said after calling into the radio show The Breakfast Club in January. \"I'm in this place with people who are in their 90s and their 80s and their 70s. .... These people, there's something wrong with these people here on this floor. I am clearly not.\"\n\nShe continued, \"Listen, this system is broken, this system that I am in. This system has falsified a lot. For the last three years, I have been caught up in the system.\"\n\nIn court filings, Williams' guardian has claimed she \"is cognitively impaired and permanently incapacitated.\" But Williams told TMZ founder Harvey Levin she feels \"fantastic\" and is \"not incapacitated.\" She also refuted the diagnosis of progressive aphasia and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), mentioning how these diseases never improve, but her mental state has been improving.\n\nThe public has taken more interest in the case since the airing of the documentary \"TMZ Presents: Saving Wendy,\" which detailed Williams living in a strict facility where she claims not to have access to the internet, incoming phone calls, or even fresh air.\n\nWilliams hosted \"The Wendy Williams Show\" from 2008 until 2021. She stepped down from hosting due to medical issues related to lymphedema and Graves' disease.\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

      "text": "'Point Of No Return': Police Leaving NYPD At Record-Breaking Pace\n\nPolice officers in New York City are resigning at a record-breaking pace this year, according to new data analyzed by the New York Post.\n\nIn the first two months of 2023, 239 officers left the New York City Police Department, substantially more than the 176 who left in 2022 and the 110 who left in 2021 during the same time period.\n\n\"The NYPD staffing emergency is approaching the point of no return,\" Police Benevolent Association President Patrick Lynch said. \"We are losing cops to better pay and benefits in other policing jobs almost every day.\"\n\nOfficers have said that poor working conditions, pay, and politics have all contributed to the large number of officers leaving the force.\n\n\"Precinct cops are being forced to work an inhumane amount of overtime, including on their days off, while being penalized for minor uniform and administrative infractions,\" one officer told The Post. \"Meanwhile, precincts barely have enough personnel to meet the minimum required to safely answer 911 calls.\"\n\nIf resignations continue at the current pace, about 1,400 officers will have quit the department by the end of the year. Some of the officers are going to work for New York's metro system while others have moved to states like Florida.\n\nAccording to one Manhattan cop, the NYPD is rife with mismanagement. \"Hundreds of cops are being hidden under fake assignments or assigned to headquarters sitting at a desk all day and are considered 'untouchable' for patrol or enforcement duty because they have high-ranking supervisors protecting them,\" he told The Post.\n\nA spokesman for City Hall said that public safety remained the city's \"top priority\" and that the city had seen a decline in certain violent crimes despite a nationwide labor shortage.\n\nMany officers started leaving in the wake of the violent protests over George Floyd's death in Minneapolis that rocked the country in 2020.\n\n\"The allure and luster of the NYPD is gone for now. They need to restore that,\" said Spero Georgedakis, the founder of Good Greek Moving and Storage who helps move former New York cops to Florida.\n\nRetirements have also ticked up in the department as crime in the city increases and the department struggles to effectively manage its limited resources.\n\nLynch said that the city needed to increase benefits and pay for the officers to keep more from leaving. \"If that doesn't happen very, very soon, we won't have a police department left,\" he said.\n\nThe increase in resignations comes as the NYPD has decreased fitness requirements, with the department recently cutting a timed 1.5-mile run in part so more women could qualify for the force.\n\nPolice departments across the country have struggled to recruit in recent years, a trend that has come alongside increased anti-police sentiment in major cities and the \"defund the police\" movement backed by some Democrat politicians.\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

But it really reinforces what I've been saying: People should not be living on our subway system, they should be in a place of care. No matter where she lived that should not have happened.\"\n\nOn Sunday last week, Kawam was sleeping on a Brooklyn F train when she was set on fire by an illegal migrant. Horrifying footage of her burning alive while standing inside the subway car spread across social media last week.\n\nKawam reportedly had a walker and several bags nearby as she slept on the train around 7:30 a.m. at the Stillwell Avenue-Coney Island station at the end of the line. She had reportedly been living in city homeless shelters since September. She had a bed at the Franklin Williams Women's Shelter in the Bronx for a few days at the beginning of December.\n\nThe city medical examiner reportedly had difficulty identifying the victim because the body was so severely burned.\n\nAn illegal migrant from Guatemala, Sebastian Zapeta, 33, was arrested and charged with first-degree murder and arson for allegedly setting her on fire. Video footage appears to show the culprit fanning the flames with his shirt, then sitting down to watch his victim burn alive.\n\nZapeta is being held at Rikers Island jail without bail.\n\nHe entered the country illegally in 2018 and was deported less than a week later, according to immigration authorities, but he eventually entered again and was living in a New York City shelter as of March 2023.\n\nAccording to a fellow shelter resident, Zapeta was addicted to smoking the synthetic drug K2 and drank vodka heavily.\n\n\"He smoked K2, drank, and bugged out,\" Raymond Robinson, who slept next to Zapeta at the Samaritan Village Forbell men's shelter in Brooklyn, told the New York Post.\n\nPolice said Zapeta told them he had been drinking so much that he did not remember setting the woman on fire.\n\n\"This was a malicious deed. A sleeping, vulnerable woman on our subway system,\" Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez said when the indictment was announced against Zapeta.\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

At DHS, Donlon was the director of New York's Office of Homeland Security.\n\nDonlon took over the position after being tapped by New York City Mayor Eric Adams following Caban's abrupt resignation from the job just a little over a week ago after his phone was seized by federal agents in a criminal investigation.\n\nThe investigation, at least in part, centers around a nightclub security business that is owned by Caban's twin brother, James Caban, and whether he used his brother to \"fix potential problems for clubs and bars,\" The Washington Post reported. The probe is reportedly focusing on other police officials as well.\n\n\"My complete focus has always been on the NYPD - the department and people I love and have dedicated over 30 years of service to,\" Caban said in a statement. \"However, the news around recent developments has created a distraction for our department, and I am unwilling to let my attention be on anything other than our important work, or the safety of the men and women of the NYPD.\"\n\nThe criminal investigation is being conducted by the Southern District of New York, which focuses on government corruption cases, and the IRS.\n\nAdams, who is under criminal investigation over potential corruption stemming from actions involving the Turkish government, has seen numerous people in his orbit come under criminal investigation recently.\n\nThe FBI executed search warrants last week at the home of Deputy Mayor for Public Safety Philip Banks and a home shared by First Deputy Mayor Sheena Wright and Schools Chancellor David Banks. Investigators seized phones belonging to Caban and Timothy Pearson, a senior adviser to the mayor. A consultant, Terence Banks, brother of Philip Banks and David Banks, was also searched.\n\nThe feds raided the home of Adams' director of Asian Affairs, Winnie Greco, earlier this year as part of a criminal probe run by the Eastern District of New York, the Times said. His former buildings commissioner, Eric Ulrich, faces bribery charges, and several donors to Adams' campaign have been charged in a straw-donor scheme.\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

The detectives, Michael Medina and Brian McCarthy, then walk Penny through his Miranda warning - never telling him Neely died.\n\nParts of the video have been used in pretrial hearings, Fox News reported , but the full 30-minute interrogation was not released until it became part of the public record during Penny's trial.\n\nPenny waived his right to an attorney and spoke with the detectives for 25 minutes after the Miranda warning, walking them through his day on the F train that led to him putting Neely in a chokehold.\n\n\"Some guy came in, and he's like with his jacket off and he's like, 'I'm gonna kill everybody. I'm gonna go to prison forever.

One of those men, 28-year-old Venezuelan national Jarwin Valero-Calderon, was reportedly wearing an ankle monitoring device that allowed the authorities to track him and the others down to their Bronx location.\n\nThe bust comes after members of the Venezuelan gang had taken over entire apartment complexes in Aurora, Colorado, this summer. \"We currently have entire complexes under gang control - complexes where staff have been beaten up, they've been threatened, their families have been threatened [and] complexes where there are no staff left on the property. These complexes are being run by this Tren de Aragua gang,\" Aurora City Council member Danielle Jurinsky explained.\n\nOne of the men arrested in the recent raid in the Bronx, Valero-Calderon, had previously been arrested on three different occasions, was convicted in Nassau County, and is facing a federal deportation order.\n\n\"This is what actual supervised release looks like?\" one law enforcement source told reporters . \"The thing about ankle monitors is you have to actually monitor them to be effective.\"\n\nCHECK OUT THE DAILY WIRE HOLIDAY GIFT GUIDE\n\nAlso arrested in the raid was 24-year-old Jhonaiker Alexander Gil Cardozo, who had been arrested on four different occasions after crossing the southern border into the United States in September 2024. Cardozo had been arrested by the NYPD for reckless endangerment and robbery in June, then again in July for grand larceny and stolen property. He was arrested yet again for shoplifting in Greenville, South Carolina.\n\nJesus Manuel Quintero Granado, 30-years old, was also arrested in the raid and is believed to be a member of Tren de Aragua. Granado crossed into the United States in September 2022 with his wife and child before heading to Canada, where their asylum claim was rejected. Agents at the northern border proceeded to release Granado into the United States.\n\nAlso arrested in the raid was 21-year-old Fernandez Franco Greymer De Dios, who was caught at the border in May and was being processed for deportation.\n\nThe raid comes as President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to carry out the largest mass deportation effort in American history, tapping former Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Tom Homan as his border czar.\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

      "text": "Police Will Keep Quitting In Droves Until The Left Stops Neutering Them With Nonsense 'Reforms'\n\nUntil the left departs from its radical racial ideology, police officers will keep departing from their jurisdictions.\n\nThe New York Police Department (NYPD) is experiencing a record number of resignations. As of June 2022, more than 1,500 officers have either resigned or retired. This marks \"the largest exodus of officers since the statistics have been available,\" according to the New York Post .\n\nAn August report noted that many of New York's finest are quitting before they even get their pensions. Oakland, California, is also experiencing a record number of police departures, according to a report from March . And last month, the entire police force of Kenly, North Carolina , quit.\n\nAcross the country, America is witnessing the same trend: Police forces are having unprecedented, catastrophic problems with retaining personnel. Consequently, homicide numbers for the first half of 2022, based on data from 23 cities, are 39 percent higher than they were in the same time period of 2019, according to a July report in Time magazine .\n\nWhat is going on?\n\nMuch of the blame seems to lie at the feet of progressive politicians and police chiefs who were installed to \"reform\" police departments following widespread calls to \"defund the police\" in the aftermath of the 2020 death of George Floyd. Media reports indicate these ideologues are applying the same blinkered, anti-racist, leftist strategies across the country, with predictable results.\n\nTake Charlottesville, Virginia, which hired RaShall Brackney , its first black female police chief, following waves of violence in 2017 \"to restore public trust\" in the city's police force. A self-described \"liberal Democrat,\" Brackney implemented radical change by disbanding highly coveted special units and taking disciplinary action against six members of the city's SWAT team, which she later disbanded.\n\nMany officers called Brackney \"heavy-handed,\" and her leadership style was alienating. Mike Wells, president of the Central Virginia chapter of the Police Benevolent Association, noted the city's force has \"lost faith\" in Brackney. A survey of the entire force found that an overwhelming majority of officers distrusted her. She resigned last year.\n\nIn New York, officers have cited \"anti-cop hostility, bail reform, and rising crime\" as reasons for quitting. \"The city is out of control - especially since bail reform,\" according to a former cop from Queens. This same officer told the New York Post that a common ethos is \"get out while you still can.\"\n\nNew York City even has a council member who has demanded the \"racist\"' NYPD be closed down. And last week , Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a member of the U.S. House who represents parts of New York City, further delayed a public-safety bill that would have provided fund grants for local police departments to bring on new hires. AOC is a longtime proponent of defunding the NYPD.\n\nIn Oakland, a police union has blamed the recent exodus of officers on the lack of support from the Oakland City Council. \"Just stop the rhetoric,\" urged Oakland officer and president of the police union Barry Donelan in a recent letter. \"Don't blame Oakland Police Officers for everything that ills Oakland. That's what we see from the council on a regular basis.\"\n\nIn Kenly, North Carolina, the entire police force resigned in July in response to the town's \"progressively responsible\" town manager - whom police chief Josh Gibson accused of creating a \"hostile work environment.\" And in Hillsborough County, Florida, State Attorney Andrew Warren developed a reputation for letting criminals go and not prosecuting crimes, angering police and leading Gov. Ron DeSantis to remove him from his post earlier this month.\n\nThe bevy of nonsensical police reforms pushed for by leftists reveals the left's blatant disrespect for America's police forces.\n\nLeftists have been downplaying their \"defund the police\" rhetoric for many months, given the alarming rise in crime across the country, especially in increasingly unpoliced urban areas. \"Even Democrats are now admitting 'Defund the Police' was a massive mistake,\" wrote CNN editor-at-large Chris Cillizza last November . But recrafted messaging can't disguise the fact that the left's ideology is one inherently at odds with what American police forces represent.\n\nPolice forces are necessary to address crime and in upholding equality before the law. And given that a disproportionate amount of crime occurs in black communities and is committed by black criminals, police officers will spend a disproportionate amount of their time addressing issues that arise in these communities.\n\nBut left-wing ideology, which is now fully under the sway of anti-racism ideologues, demands that the country's police departments must be dismantled.\n\nPolice work is also inherently violent and physically coercive, which is why it's no surprise that women make up less than 13 percent of police officers nationally.\n\nPolicing naturally lends itself to men because it is a profession that demands a high degree of physical and mental tenacity that is most readily found in those with high testosterone and who are physically able to engage wild drunks, abusive boyfriends, and the mentally unstable. Yet liberal ideology indicts men who manifest such traits as guilty of \"toxic masculinity,\" \"heteronormativity,\" and perpetuating \"the patriarchy.\"\n\nIn other words, as much the left tries to present itself as pro-police, its underlying ideology is decidedly against them, their identity, and their mission. Thus even when they don't defund them, they can't help but lecture them about how terrible they are.\n\nIn May, Adam Graham, a mayor from the state of Oklahoma, aggressively confronted two police officers in the middle of a routine traffic stop because he assumed they were engaged in racial profiling of a black driver despite one of the officers being black.\n\nUntil the left departs from its radical racial ideology, police officers will keep departing from their jurisdictions.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

He then used his position at the NYPD and as a staff sergeant in the U.S. Army Reserve to feed \"non-public information about internal operations of the NYPD\" back to certain Chinese leaders and his \"handler\" at the consulate, who he gave access to NYPD officials through invitations to official events.\n\n\"Despite alleging torture and persecution at the hands of PRC security officials, the government's investigation has revealed that Angwang has traveled back to the PRC on numerous occasions since his asylum application was granted,\" states a detention memo from federal prosecutors.\n\n\"These are not the actions of an individual who fears torture or persecution at the hands of the PRC, thus showing that his U.S. citizenship was secured through false pretenses.\"\n\nBecause of his secret level security clearance due to his position in the Army Reserve as well as his good standing in the NYPD, Angwang frequently communicated information to \"to raise our country's soft power\" to multiple Chinese officials since 2014. He also had frequented visits to the consulate.\n\n\"The official is believed to have been assigned to the China Association for Preservation and Development of Tibetan Culture, a division that focuses on, among other things, neutralizing sources of potential opposition to the policies and authority of the PRC,\" the memo said.\n\n\"In other words, Angwang received tasks from, and reported back to [People's Republic of China] officials,\" the memo clarified.\n\nChinese foreign ministers have attempted to misconstrue the charges against Angwang as \"pure fabrication,\" calling it a smear campaign against China by the U.S.\n\n\"The indictment is full of hedging terms such as 'seems' and 'possibly,' indicating the falsehood of the accusations,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said. \"The U.S. won't succeed in its smears against Chinese consulates and personnel in the US.\"\n\nAccording to NYPD Police Commissioner Dermot Shea, Angwang \"violated every oath he took in this country.\"\n\n\"One to the United States, another to the U.S. Army, and a third to this Police Department. From the earliest stages of this investigation, the NYPD's Intelligence and Internal Affairs bureaus worked closely with the FBI's Counterintelligence Division to make sure this individual would be brought to justice,\" Shea said.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "The NYPD's Revolt Is A Direct Threat To Democracy\n\nSince the moment when police officers turned their backs in protest on New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, we've seen the type of escalating activity in the city which would be more recognizable as the preview to a messy Latin American coup d'etat. The latest is a form of purposeful sabotage on the part of the NYPD, which is now actively shirking its duty to enforce the law. According to the New York Post, traffic tickets and summonses have plummeted by 94 percent , and overall arrests are down 66 percent for the week compared to the same period last year. Here's the data comparisons from this year to 2013:\n\nCitations for traffic violations fell by 94 percent, from 10,069 to 587, during that time frame. Summonses for low-level offenses like public drinking and urination also plunged 94 percent - from 4,831 to 300. Even parking violations are way down, dropping by 92 percent, from 14,699 to 1,241. Drug arrests by cops assigned to the NYPD's Organized Crime Control Bureau - which are part of the overall number - dropped by 84 percent, from 382 to 63.\n\nConsidering how much New York, as with many of our other major cities, has leaned toward over-policing, this isn't all a bad thing - I'm not going to get worked up about cops handing out fewer parking violations. But as a whole, this represents a completely irresponsible rejection of the duty to enforce the law. Yesterday, speaking to a graduating class of more than 800 new officers at Madison Square Garden, de Blasio was booed and heckled as he struggled to extend an oratorical olive branch. De Blasio told the gathering of new cops \"you will confront all the problems that plague our society, problems that you didn't create\" - in response, a heckler jeered \"You created them!\" People in the audience applauded and cheered as a de Blasio tried to recover with even more voluminous praise for the force.\n\nSupporters of the NYPD have pointed out throughout the back-turning that their officers feel upset at Mayor de Blasio and others, that they feel they are less safe because of the comments of politicians. This is one more example of one of the most irritating tendencies of unionized police forces today - a recurring demand that they receive the same attitude of respect for authority given to the United States military, without any of the responsibility and duty that comes with it. A poll last week found that a mere 15 percent of active duty service members approve of President Obama - understandable, considering his many policy decisions and a laundry list of questionable choices.\n\nBut is the American military turning their backs on the Commander in Chief? Showing contempt for him? Going AWOL with the endorsement of their superiors? Shirking their duty? Booing and jeering at him at a graduation ceremony? No. They, after all, are not unionized.\n\nThe real rise of frustration with police officers in America comes down to one thing: an enduring sense that the current law enforcement system is unfair. We have to abide by rules they do not. We are the civilians, as if they are not. When we go before a court, enduring bias assumes that police are responsible and honest, even if the evidence suggests otherwise. District attorneys have one method for grand juries with cops , and different methods for ones without cops. The problem is one of institutional disrespect for their own civic obligations. We have to obey the commands of officers, but they have no real desire to obey the commands of their own authorities, or the ultimate authority they serve - the people.\n\nIn retrospect, Mayor de Blasio should've responded to the backs turning by firing people immediately. The NYPD needed to be reminded that chain of command exists, and that they are not at the top of it. Instead, what New York City is experiencing now amounts to nothing less than open rebellion by the lone armed force under the worst kind of weakened junta, one led by a figure ideologically radical and personally weak, who has lost control of his bureaucracies and may soon be devoured by them.\n\nPerhaps he can take a cue from a political leader of another time, who faced open revolt from a police force in another major city.\n\nTo Mr. Samuel Gompers \r\nPresident \r\nAmerican Federation of Labor \r\nNew York City, N.Y. Replying to your telegram, I have already refused to remove the Police Commissioner of Boston. I did not appoint him. He can assume no position which the courts would uphold except what the people have by the authority of their law vested in him. He speaks only with their voice. The right of the police of Boston to affiliate has always been questioned, never granted, is now prohibited. The suggestion of President Wilson to Washington does not apply to Boston. There the police have remained on duty. Here the Policemen's Union left their duty, an action which President Wilson characterized as a crime against civilization. Your assertion that the Commissioner was wrong cannot justify the wrong of leaving the city unguarded. That furnished the opportunity, the criminal element furnished the action. There is no right to strike against the public safety by anybody, anywhere, any time. You ask that the public safety again be placed in the hands of these same policemen while they continue in disobedience to the laws of Massachusetts and in their refusal to obey the orders of the Police Department. Nineteen men have been tried and removed. Others having abandoned their duty, their places have, under the law, been declared vacant on the opinion of the Attorney General. I can suggest no authority outside the courts to take further action. I wish to join and assist in taking a broad view of every situation. A grave responsibility rests on all of us. You can depend on me to support you in every legal action and sound policy. I am equally determined to defend the sovereignty of Massachusetts and to maintain the authority and jurisdiction over her public officers where it has been placed by the Constitution and law of her people. Calvin Coolidge \r\nGovernor of Massachusetts\n\nI doubt that the Salvador Allende of Park Slope has the stomach for such a confrontation - but the reality is that the NYPD today is turning into an embarrassing neighborhood bully, and the only thing a bully understands is force. You wouldn't want those broken windows to stay broke, would you?\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media. All rights reserved."

      "text": "Bloomberg's Apology For Stop, Question, And Frisk Is Shameful\n\nIn a vain attempt to become president Michael Bloomberg has thrown his police commissioner and the NYPD under the bus.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, meet woke Michael Bloomberg. The newly minted, almost-candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination is planning to run in the moderate lane, but that didn't stop him from reversing course on one of the biggest questions of his political career this week, and in the process, throwing his own legacy and the New York City Police Department under the bus. In an act of shameless pandering, the three-term New York mayor apologized for the policing tactic known as \"Stop, Question, and Frisk.\"\n\nAt a church in Brooklyn, Bloomberg made his farcical mea culpa, saying, \"I got something important really wrong. I didn't understand back then the full impact that stops were having on the black and Latino communities. I was totally focused on saving lives - but as we know: good intentions aren't good enough.\"\n\nIf you look closely at this statement you can see what makes it nonsensical. He was focused on saving lives, God forbid. In 2002 Michael Bloomberg inherited from Rudy Giuliani the most effective police force to ever exist. When Rudy and his police commissioner William Bratton took over in 1994 there were over 2000 homicides in New York. By the time he left that number was more than cut in half.\n\nThose numbers were the result of a revolution in crime fighting known as proactive policing. Central to this success was CompStat, a computerized system that allowed the NYPD to pinpoint where resources were needed to fight violent crime. In most cases, those resources were needed in black and Latino communities where murder rates were vastly higher than in other neighborhoods.\n\nIn 2002, when Bloomberg took over as mayor he brought on Ray Kelly to lead the NYPD. A tough-as-nails beat cop and the first person ever to rise from police cadet to police commissioner, Kelly's tenure lasted until 2013 when the murder rate was almost cut in half again. His signature policy, which intended to and succeeded in keeping illegal guns off the street, was Stop, Question, and Frisk.\n\nThe practice of Stop, Question, and Frisk was rooted in the 1968 Supreme Court decision, Terry v Ohio, which allowed police officers without probable cause to arrest, to frisk a suspect they considered to be dangerous. What Kelly, the beat cop, knew was that police in their districts know where the danger is, and need the tools to protect against it. Under Kelly's reign the risk of carrying an illegal gun in New York City became enormous, and he for one has no doubt that Stop, Question, and Frisk was essential in saving thousands of lives, most of them black and brown.\n\nNot too long ago Michael Bloomberg agreed with that assessment. He was furious when a federal judge found the practice unconstitutional, notwithstanding Terry v Ohio, and even more irate when Bill de Blasio, who took over as mayor in 2014 refused to appeal the decision. Opponents of the practice argue that crime has continued to decrease since it stopped, although troubling indicators are already emerging.\n\nBut this argument fails to take into account the fundamental transformation of neighborhoods that Kelly's police force undertook. It's like looking at a drug addict who is five years sober and saying, \"see, she's still sober, rehab had nothing to do with it.\" If Bloomberg had simply taken the position that Stop, Question, and Frisk is no longer needed that would be one thing, but to apologize for it is an insult the police force that helped make his reputation as an effective mayor.\n\nThis could not come at a worse time. In New York City today, people are jumping turnstiles en masse to protest police keeping the subway system safe. Officers have had buckets of water thrown on them and their vehicles. Every move the NYPD makes occurs under the gaze of 8 million smart phones and still abuse is rare. But that doesn't keep the professional Left from smearing New York's finest as a bunch of racist thugs, despite the fact that the NYPD is a leader in expanding diversity.\n\nFor Bloomberg to lend his voice to this slander in a cynical and vain attempt to win the White House is shameful. Michael Bloomberg was not the one patrolling the streets of New York City as the crime rate plummeted, much as he likes to take credit for it. He was not in harms way if criminals were carrying illegal guns, the NYPD were.\n\nBloomberg's change of heart is not the result of any new information, its pure politics, plain and simple. And it is an insult to a police force that more than anything else, transformed the world's greatest city and saved thousands of lives in the process.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "What Everyone's Missing By Focusing On NYPD Chokehold Of Eric Garner\n\nEric Garner's death was ruled a homicide due to a chokehold and chest compression. However, while most media outlets have been focused on the chokehold, many have ignored the dangerous, yet overlooked, chest compression known as Restraint-Related Positional Asphyxia. This has largely been a concern of mental health care workers throughout the United States, who have to occasionally restrain patients who have become a danger to themselves or others. It came to the national light several years ago after a number of deaths during restraints at hospitals and police departments.\n\nI've worked in mental health for six years and I teach verbal and physical crisis prevention to both behavioral health staff and emergency department personnel. It occurs, not from a \"chokehold,\" as seen in the video. Indeed, it doesn't appear that the officer held onto Garner's throat long enough to directly cause his death. Rather, restraint-related positional asphyxia is the result of the patient being face down on the ground or having someone put his weight on the individual's chest, leaving the patient unable to expand his or her chest to inhale. In this way (and if this is truly the case), the death could be ruled a homicide (death caused by another human being) without being intentional murder. Officer Daniel Pantaleo is seen in the video first putting Garner in a chokehold and the group of officers wrestling him to the ground. However, once face-down on the concrete to put the cuffs on, Pantaleo is kneeling on Garner's upper back and head. It was at this point that Garner began to say he couldn't breathe.\n\nIn mental health, our prerogative is to maintain the safety of our patients, to not cause harm even if they represent a danger to us and require restraint. For this reason, we are trained to never put a patient face-down on the ground. The ground does not have any give, particularly concrete and hospital floors. Face-down on the ground, the patient is often unable to expand his chest to take a breath. This condition is exacerbated by people piling on top of the patient in an effort to keep him or her down, the patient's weight and health conditions, and his or her stress level at the time. Obviously, Garner was in a stressful situation at the time, which would result in increased blood flow and heart rate. Those would, in turn, cause his breathing to become more rapid and strained. He also had officers placing their weight on top of him as they tried to place the handcuffs on him. Garner was about 350 pounds; his own body weight alone would have made it difficult to expand his chest when face-down on concrete. The added weight of the officers increased this weight and probably made it impossible for a body to withstand. Whenever the chest is compressed and restrained, the danger exists.\n\nOne of the arguments made was that the chokehold did not cause his death because he was able to speak and say, \"I can't breathe.\" In the video he was making the statement that he couldn't breathe after the officer had released the hold and he was being handcuffed face-down, with several officers on top of him. He would not have been able to speak if he were in a chokehold that cut off his airway, but he would have been able to say it if his death was due to chest compression. He was able to force breath from his lungs across his vocal chords, but he was not able to get any air back in. The same way a mouse can still squeak as a boa constrictor squeezes the life out him, Garner was able to make desperate pleas. But every time he did, his time grew shorter and shorter. A chokehold can either cut off air intake through the windpipe or cut off the carotid artery, sending blood to the brain. You can go unconscious quickly, but once it is released, you can continue to breathe normally (it happens in MMA all the time). Not so during an arrest, which can often take several minutes as the officers restrain, cuff, clear the area, and figure out what they are going to do next. With restraint-related asphyxia, it is not like holding your breath, but rather it is having no breath at all because every bit of air has been forced out. This has happened in numerous cases of hospital restraints across the country and has spurned legislation to curb its practice, which is one of the reasons I and other instructors educate mental health care workers in how to properly and safely restrain patients.\n\nThe police, however, put a suspect face-down in order to handcuff him. Whether or not this can be avoided through new tactics, I don't know. To some degree it seems necessary in order to facilitate the arrest, but the dangers are amply demonstrated. Of course, this does not mean that no one should have been held accountable for Garner's death. The cases that have appeared in hospitals and police departments have resulted in massive lawsuits and, considering the Garner family's $70 million civil suit, the same will probably prove true in this case. In this way, the officer may not have been acting negligently by grabbing Garner from behind. However, having him face-down on the concrete for an extended period of time while screaming that he couldn't breathe can be seen as negligence on the part of everyone involved. Perhaps educating officers in the danger of these kind of restraints would be appropriate if they don't receive it already. However, if the officer(s) were acting within the scope of what they are trained and ordered to do, one can excruciatingly reconcile that the legalities didn't add up to make an indictment.\n\nThis, of course, is all somewhat beside the point. Legality does not make something right or wrong. Six officers were used to execute a law against selling loose cigarettes. His death was, in all manner of speaking, wrong and I would argue that it was more negligence on the part of all the officers involved (who were given immunity) for not responding to Garner's repeated cries that he couldn't breathe, than to Officer Pantaleo's \"chokehold.\" Several articles have come out regarding the \"Broken Windows\" theory of policing, particularly in Slate and Commentary , and these criticisms should be heeded. The technicality of how Garner died may have gotten Officer Pantaleo off the hook from indictment, but the bigger questions remain and are now at the forefront of our national discourse.\n\nMarc E.

      "text": "State Troopers Demand Exit From New York City: We 'Now Cannot Safely Arrest A Violent Person'\n\nThe sttate police association's president stated that officers were being put in danger by the city's new laws, which criminalized common methods of restraining suspects.\n\nThe president of the State Police association is demanding troopers be removed from New York City after the passage of policing restrictions this Wednesday. The request, which was filed to the New York State Police superintendent, stated the city's new regulations would harm officers' ability to perform their duties, and place them in legal jeopardy.\n\n\"This poorly conceived bill, which will be signed into law by Mayor de Blasio today, puts an undue burden upon our Troopers,\" Association President Thomas Mungeer wrote. \"It will prevent Troopers from safely and effectively arresting resistant subjects.\"\n\nThe proposed exit comes in the midst of a historic crime surge in the city. Shootings have nearly doubled this year, with 53 new victims from this past weekend alone. Yet this hasn't stopped the city from slashing police budgets and pushing through a wish-list of laws restraining officers.\n\nIn a statement to The Federalist Thursday night, Mungeer argued these laws would place law enforcement officers in harm's way: \"This legislation is certainly placing my Troopers in danger as they now cannot safely arrest a violent person without being placed in jeopardy of being arrested themselves,\"\n\nMost controversial of the pack of regulations has been the so-called \"diaphragm bill.\" The legislation outlaws not only the use of chokeholds, but applying most forms of pressure to the back or chest while arresting violent criminals. This new law was critical to the association's decision to exit.\n\n\"These techniques are commonly used by many law enforcement agencies statewide and nationwide when officers are faced with violently combative subjects.\" Mungeer wrote regarding the diaphragm bill . \"I find it extremely troubling that these acts are now defined as criminal in nature, even if they were unintentional and no injury was sustained by the subject.\"\n\nIn order for the officers to be removed, the association will require the approval of the State Police superintendent, Keith Corlett. As of press time, he has yet to issue an official reponse, but President Mungeer is optimistic. \"Supt. Corlett has a good working relationship with the NYSTPBA, so I anticipate a thoughtful conversation soon,\" he stated to The Federalist.\n\nState Troopers have been assisting the NYPD for five years now, according to the association. Adding State Troopers for support has been longtime priority of Gov.Andrew Cuomo, a move that has been criticized for leaving rural areas understaffed in favor of New York City.\n\nDe Blasio has yet to make a statement about the request. He has however, applauded the new police restrictions: \"This is a powerful day. Powerful day for so many reasons. And it's a moment when you can feel change coming.\"\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media. All rights reserved."

According to the New York Police Department, more than 200 suspected members and associates of the gang remain to be documented, as the gang continues to expand its reach.\n\nThe NYPD has specifically identified 41 migrant \"gangbangers\" who have collectively accumulated 143 arrests since the beginning of the year, according to a report by the New York Post . Nearly half of these arrests occurred in high-traffic retail areas in Midtown, including Times Square, Rockefeller Center, and Radio City Music Hall.\n\n\"If you go back two years - that's about when we think they first started arriving - we've made 45% more arrests than we did two years ago,\" a law enforcement source said, per the New York Post. \"This is a gang that conspires to make money off of committing crimes.\"\n\nThe gang's influence reportedly extends beyond official members. An offshoot group, \"Diablos de la 42,\" includes members as young as 11 years old, and law enforcement has made multiple arrests involving both TdA and these affiliated groups.\n\nOut of the 517 arrests citywide this year, 57 percent occurred in Midtown, with most migrant-related arrests involving felony charges such as robbery and grand larceny as well as assault and auto theft.\n\n\"When you add associates and co-defendants that aren't in the [NYPD gang] database, there's 80 more individuals who are candidates for the database, and possibly hundreds as arrest associates in other crimes,\" the law enforcement source to the New York Post.\n\n\"When you factor in those associates, it's 295 out of 517 total arrests we took in Midtown and neighboring precincts,\" the source continued. \"That's TdA, [Diablos] and their associates. That's 57% impacting crime in the 14th, 18th, 17th, 19th precincts. It's not just one area.\"\n\nPowered by The Post Millennial CMSTM Comments\n\nWe're independent and can't be cancelled.

This development follows the resignation of former NYPD Commissioner Edward Caban , whose home was also raided by the FBI.\n\nIn a statement released on Saturday, Donlon confirmed that authorities \"took materials that came into my possession 20 years ago and are unrelated to my work with the New York City Police Department.\" Donlon did not clarify what federal agency raided his home.\n\nDonlon, who has a background in federal law enforcement, came out of retirement to serve as the NYPD's interim commissioner. Sources speaking to the New York Post suggest that investigators are looking into whether Donlon improperly took classified documents from his time with the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nWhen Dolon accepted the position as interim commissioner, he vowed to, \"uphold the highest standards of integrity and transparency, and support our dedicated officers who put their lives on the line every day to keep us safe.\"\n\nThe raid is part of a broader federal investigation into several New York City officials under the administration of Mayor Eric Adams. Multiple figures, including Deputy Mayor for Public Safety Phil Banks, former NYPD official Tim Pearson, School Chancellor David Banks, First Deputy Mayor Sheena Wright, and others have faced scrutiny.\n\nEdward Caban, who resigned as NYPD commissioner earlier this week, had his electronic devices seized as part of a corruption and influence-peddling probe.

Wilma Augustin, 36, was another victim of alleged killer Ramon Rivera, 51, the Daily Mail reported . Rivera, a homeless man with a history of mental illness and criminal convictions, had just been released from Rikers Island before allegedly going on an unprovoked rampage that killed three people.\n\nNew York police charged Rivera with three counts of first degree murder, ABC News reported, and he was scheduled to appear in court Tuesday. The stabbings claimed two men before Augustin was mortally wounded. Police arrested Rivera after a taxi driver called and said he saw a man accosting a woman. He thought it was a robbery in progress and he tried to intervene by encouraging pedestrians to stop the attacker.\n\nWitness Baha Biten told ABC7 : \"I'm walking with him, I'm saying 'drop it man, it's not worth it\". I told him \"drop the bag, there's going to be cops up ahead.'\" Surveillance video caught Rivera retrieving a kitchen knife that he had hidden in his backpack and hiding it inside his shirt. Police took the assailant to Manhattan's 10th Precinct. He was seen leaving the building Monday evening in handcuffs and shackles, wearing white prison coveralls.\n\nPolice had charged Rivera with commiting a number of robberies going back to 2023. He pleaded guilty to those crimes, received a sentence of almost a year in jail and was released from Rikers Island after eight months. He was arrested again as soon as hit the street, charged with another previous offense but was let go, the Mail reported. It was after that when he began his stabbing spree.\n\nMayor Eric Adams (D-NYC) says he can't understand why a man like Rivera was let loose on the public again. \"We are still looking over his record, but there's a real question on why he was on the street,\" the mayor said Monday, according to the Mail.\n\nPowered by The Post Millennial CMSTM Comments\n\nWe're independent and can't be cancelled.

According to The New York Post, the drone was about five feet in diameter and was raised in the air by a police officer.\n\nAn email alert notified the NYPD about the presence of the drone that was discovered on the sidewalk on Fifth St. During the investigation, an onlooker said that he was employed in the same building where the drone's manufacturers are headquartered - Amogy, Inc., a company that promotes the use of ammonia as a renewable fuel that can even be used for some aircraft.\n\nAmogy CEO Seonghoon Woo later acknowledged company ownership of the drone, explaining that it had ended up on the ground after an office party in November. Woo said the drone was unserviceable and had been sitting there for over a month before police found it, according to Post sources. The NYPD used its Emergency Services Unit truck to sever the drone's nitrogen parts so that it could be moved to the 88th precinct for storage.\n\nRebecca Weiner, NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Counterterrorism and Intelligence, told reporters that the current heightened concerns about drones being sighted in New York and New Jersey could be the result of people just thinking they are more drones in the air than usual.\n\n\"What we've seen over the past few days here in the city has actually been quite normal, frankly, in terms of the actual drone activity that we see everyday,\" she said, declaring that there are about 2,000 drones in the air above New York City during any given week. \"You have a really strong uptick in reporting but not a strong uptick in actual drone detection, which makes sense - all people are seeing on the news is drone sightings everywhere,\" The Post reported.\n\nThe FBI and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have spun a similar line of talking points, releasing a statement on Friday about reports of drone sightings in New Jersey that claimed they have \"no evidence\" that the drones \"pose a national security or public safety threat or have a foreign nexus.\"\n\nPowered by The Post Millennial CMSTM Comments\n\nWe're independent and can't be cancelled.
